Family 'Squabbles' take Tulare Encore spotlight \nThe Enchanted Playhouse presents their own take on the classic tale of buccaneers and gold with the premiere of \"Treasure Island,\" directed by Don Williams and adapted for the stage by Joseph George Caruso, 7 p.m. Friday, Oct. 2 at the Main Street Theater. \nThe cast of both new and veteran actors is itching to enter the spotlight â€” in the case of actor Zachary Ludden who sports a dense black beard in the role of Captain Billy Bones, quite literally. \n\"It's kind of itchy. It makes me really want to rip it off,\" Ludden said. \"But you gotta do what you gotta do. The show must go on.\" \nIn his opinion the show is rated a bit PG â€” perhaps that's influenced by the fact that his character meets his demise by being cast with the dreaded Black Spot â€” but no need to cover those young eyes or buccaneers because Ludden is back on stage within the next two minutes as Baby Face O'Brien. \n\"It's very fast-paced,\" he said of the show. \"I die in one scene and I'm back in another. It doesn't drag on, you're ready and waiting for what happens next.\" \nConsidering the numerous adaptations, the audience is likely well-aware of the coming-of-age story of the young Jim Hawkins as he befriends the cunning pirate Long John Silver in the quest to find the hidden loot of Captain Billy Bones. \nBut that doesn't mean the production doesn't have a few twists on the classic as well. From 'Swan Lake' to 'The Exorcist,' Visalia Fox is busy \n\"You kind of have to look at all the other versions of 'Treasure Island' to kind of make sure you're having your own spin on a character like this,\" Kelly Ventura said of his role as the legendary Long John Silver. \nHe certainly took note of the equally legendary actors that took on the role including Orson Welles and Charleton Heston, as well as other similar pirate characters like the character of Hector Barbossa in the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" films. That doesn't mean though that his performance is in any way identical. \n\"As an actor you don't ever want to hear someone say you played it just like so-and-so,' Ventura noted. \"You want it to be you playing the part, not that person who played the part.\" \nKelly Ventura, right, and Andrew Rozum rehearse for the Enchanted Playhouse production of \"Treasure Island\" on Tuesday, September 29, 2015. (Photo: Ron Holman, ) \nPlaying it straight is 13-year-old Andrew Rozum in the role of Jim Hawkins, an intelligent decision considering he and his character have a lot in common. \n\"He's the same age as me and he's pretty adventurous, which I like to think I am,\" Rozum said. \"He's really adventurous, but he's a little timid because he hasn't had adventures before. He gets intertwined with all these adventures and he ends up kind of saving the day.\" \nMany of life's lessons lie ahead for both the character of Jim Hawkins and Long John Silver, as the young boy finds a mentor while the hardened pirate discovers a soft side to that wooden peg of a leg. Raven Festival lands in Three Rivers \nIt's quite a transition for actor Ventura, as the last time he depicted a father-figure on the Enchanted Playhouse stage it was as the bumbling \"Fantastic Mr. Fox.\" \n\"There's more of a sharp contrast from Mr. Fox always being good but stupid, and Long John Silver being complete evil, and turning around as someone who saves Jim and saves the rest of the crew,\" Ventura said. \nAs for Auntie Nancy played by Luanne Yancy, her focus is on playing up the wacky side of her character. \n\"Auntie Nancy is really eccentric and crazy, and I added some to her,\" Yancy said. \"She wants the gold for herself, that's why she's going along on the treasure hunt.\" \nThe rest of the cast follow suit in bringing a bit of their own craziness into the spotlight, but that doesn't mean their sense of professionalism has gone overboard. \nBruce Rakich, right, Kelly Ventura, Faith Ludden, Andrew Rozum and Luann Yancey rehearse for the Enchanted Playhouse production of \"Treasure Island\" on Tuesday, September 29, 2015. (Photo: Ron Holman,) \n\"Everyone is just really unique and perfect for the roles they got and I think that just brings the show together,\" she said. \nConsidering the clashing swords, the frequent \"yarrs\" of approval, and the constant stream of puns the cast throw at each other while on the sidelines â€” none of the inherently funny pirates need to dig deep to let their golden talent shine. \nHow to attend \n\"Treasure Island\" at 7 p.m. Friday, Oct. 2 at the Main Street Theater, 307 E. Main St. Additional performances are 7 p.m. Friday, Oct. 9 and 16; 4 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 3 and 10 and 2 p.m. Sunday, Oct. 4 and 11, with a final performance 2 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 17 as part of the Arts Consortium's annual Taste the Arts festival. Tickets are $8 at the door and $7 in advance for Friday and Saturday performances. Sunday matinees are $5. \nTickets are available at Party City, Valhallas Restaurant and Espi's Diapers to Dates in Visalia and at the Wildflower CafÃ© in Exeter.
