Entire public transport will be shifting to CNG, so some time needs to be given to them, otherwise the public will be put to inconvenience. I do not want public to suffer,” the judge said.\n“Those who are willing to give me undertaking, I will give them time. Those who are not, my order passed in case of Ola will apply to them with immediate effect,” the judge added.\nThe court passed the interim order while hearing a plea filed by Association of Radio Taxis, represented by senior advocate Nidesh Gupta, who contended that the court’s order upholding a ban on diesel cabs providing point-to-point service in the national capital was being implemented only against Ola while other app-based taxi services were violating it with impunity.\nHearing which the court yesterday had asked Uber to take instruction on this aspect of the time frame in which they will phase out diesel taxis.\nMeanwhile, the court asked Uber India, represented through senior advocate Rajiv Nayar, who said that it can replace the diesel taxis with CNG cabs within six months, to give details with regard to the manner in which they will be phasing out their diesel cabs by March 1.\nIt also asked the cabs companies present in court besides Uber and Ola to give some suggestions to the court about the mechanism, by which the facts and figures can be verified by the state transport department.\n 14, 2015 7:48 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:18:51.317+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
