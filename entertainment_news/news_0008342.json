Relaxing never really was part of her plan. She decided in 2011 against running for re-election as town supervisor in Brighton not so she could retire, but so she could challenge Republican Monroe County Executive Maggie Brooks for the region’s top elected office.\nIt’s been four years since she lost that race. Why is the Democrat giving it another shot?\nFrankel says she still has a driving passion for public service and gets satisfaction from making an impact. She cheerfully recalls the thrill of victories like helping to shut down the Travelers Motel in Brighton, a magnet for crime, back in the mid-1990s.\nToday, she sharply criticizes GOP leadership of the county for corruption, waste and mismanagement, and says she has a proven record as the \"transformative leader\" needed to turn things around.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nDinolfo say she'll be a problem solver\n“I’m going to clean up county government,” Frankel says.\nAgree with her or not, Frankel has a lot to say about the county’s promise and problems, and she is eager to discuss her ideas in detail. She recently called a reporter to clarify the location of a specific parking lot that she thinks the county should stop leasing downtown.\nOn the campaign trail, voters — even some Republicans — are making clear they want a new direction, Frankel says.\n“There is a genuine sense of frustration in the community that issues that are important in people’s lives aren’t being addressed,” she says.\nBuy Photo Monroe County Executive candidate Sandra Frankel is greeted by Brighton resident Hollis Hames at a luncheon for UAW retirees at the Diplomat Banquet Center on Oct. 15. (Photo: LAUREN PETRACCA/@laurenpetracca/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER)\nRecord in Brighton\nFrankel has made her 20 years as Brighton supervisor the cornerstone of her campaign.\nShe says this experience — balancing the books, managing departments, overseeing community projects — sets her apart from her Republican opponent, Cheryl Dinolfo, who has been county clerk since 2004.\n“While that serves a large number of people in the county, the experience is very limited because it’s a ministerial function,” Frankel says of the clerk position. “My experience is as a very successful CEO.”\nSince Frankel has made much of her record, it’s little surprise that Republicans have, too.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nRajesh Barnabas challenges status quo\nA recent campaign flier funded by the Republican State Committee said that voters rejected Frankel in 2011 because of her “tax and spend record” as supervisor.\nAnd in an interview this month, Dinolfo said that Frankel raised taxes 12 times in Brighton. Going after Frankel on tax issues makes sense as a strategy, says Curt Smith, a former speechwriter for President George H.W. Bush, an author and senior lecturer in English at the University of Rochester.\n“If I’m the Dinolfo people, I’m spending what money I have in effect saying Sandy Frankel is out of the mainstream,” he says.\nFrankel says in fact, she shored up a town that was \"fraying at the edges\" in financial terms.\nShe says she inherited a budget deficit and the threat of a credit rating downgrade that would have forced the town to pay higher interest to borrow money. She says in her first year, she froze spending, negotiated a wage freeze with unions and took smaller steps to reduce costs.\n“In fact,” she says, “I’m fiscally conservative.”\nThat same year, however, the town raised its property tax rate by about 20 percent.\nFrankel says she understands that figure may sound scary, but she describes it as one step among many to balance a long-mismanaged budget. She downplays the impact of that change — an increase of about $82 a year for a homeowner whose property was assessed at $100,000, she says.\n“I wasn’t elected to eviscerate the essential services and programs that people in the community depended upon, wanted and needed,” Frankel says.\nAfter that, the average annual tax rate increase in Brighton was at or below the rate of inflation, Frankel says. In some years, it declined as she eliminated redundant positions, she says. Other years, it rose because voters approved referendums for public infrastructure projects like the creation of a town-wide park system and sidewalk repairs.\nToday, Brighton is more financially stable and the changes during her tenure reflect the town's values, Frankel says. “I’m proud of my record.”\nIt makes sense for Frankel to play to her experience, says Timothy Kneeland, history and political science chairman at Nazareth College and director of the Center for Public History.\n“She’s a solid candidate and a good, solid member of the Democratic Party,” he says.\nBuy Photo Idolo Madau of Gates shares a laugh with Monroe County executive candidate Sandra Frankel at a luncheon for UAW retirees at the Diplomat Banquet Center on Oct. 15. (Photo: LAUREN PETRACCA/@laurenpetracca/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER)\nWhy politics?\nFrankel grew up in Miami Beach, Florida, when racial segregation was the law.\nThat’s how it was in New Orleans, too, when Frankel attended Newcomb College of Tulane University. She says she participated in sit-ins to protest racist policies and was drawn to women’s equality, too.\nThat activism is where her interest in politics began.\n“This instilled in me a desire to end discrimination, bias, prejudice and to work for equality for all,” Frankel says.\n'Get our fiscal house in order'\nFrankel says Monroe County is under deep financial strain.\nShe refers often to a state Comptroller’s Office report that said this is the most fiscally stressed county in New York. Outgoing County Executive Maggie Brooks largely blames the strain on unfunded state mandates.\nFrankel says most counties are doing a better job managing the mandate problem.\n“We have to get our fiscal house in order,” she says.\nBut she rules out a tax increase. Frankel says she can find and eliminate waste in the $1 billion budget and reinvest a portion of the savings in programs that matter.\nFrankel admits she doesn’t have all the answers looking from the outside in.\nBut she offers a list of $4.2 million in potential savings in the county budget. Some ideas are fairly concrete, such as giving up leases for downtown parking lots and office space that Frankel doesn’t think the county needs.\nBuy Photo Monroe County Executive candidate Sandra Frankel introduces herself to Sandi Giardino of Spencerport during a luncheon for UAW retirees at the Diplomat Banquet Center on Oct. 15. (Photo: LAUREN PETRACCA/@laurenpetracca/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER)\nOthers are more tentative and would rely on renegotiating existing leases or contracts.\nFrankel wants to tap $900,000 in anticipated savings and put it toward child care subsidies for working families in her first year, saying this will help parents to hold down jobs. Frankel also wants to tap $300,000 to create new offices of Public Integrity and Violence Prevention.\nShe also is optimistic that the local economy will grow, producing more tax revenue.\n'Without integrity, you have nothing'\nFrankel, like Dinolfo, says she wants to establish an Office of Public Integrity that will operate independently from her office, with authority to work directly with law enforcement.\nFrankel takes her ethics pledge a step further by vowing not to accept campaign donations from county employees, nor any people or businesses with applications before the county. She also says family members of county department heads and senior county officials should be ineligible for county appointments and jobs.\nIn addition, Frankel says she wants all leases and contracts to be re-bid when they expire instead of automatically renewing them.\n\"Without integrity,\" she says, \"you have nothing.\"\nFrankel also is a longtime critic of local development corporations — nonprofit entities that the county created to finance major infrastructure projects.\nThe LDCs are at the center of a criminal case alleging that four men steered contracts for that work to well-connected bidders.\nFrankel has backed past Democratic efforts to subject the LDCs to greater oversight by the County Legislature and require them to operate more openly. She questions whether a separate plan from Dinolfo to eliminate LDCs is realistic.\nTargeting the right industries\nFrankel says the county’s economic development arm needs to focus.\nIn her view, the County of Monroe Industrial Development Agency too often hands out tax breaks. For example, a law firm moving from downtown to Perinton shouldn’t get a tax abatement for its new offices, Frankel says.\nInstead, COMIDA should focus on medium- and high-skill industries that show promise and pay good wages, including photonics and optics, green jobs and food production.\nFrankel also wants to set up a $5 million low-interest loan program for small manufacturing and high-tech businesses, and a low-interest, forgivable loan program for Monroe Community College students who commit to work in targeted local industries for at least five years.\nShe sees her plans to boost child care subsidies for working parents as part of an economic development plan. She has pledged to try to double the number of children who receive county-subsidized child care and to lobby for more state and federal funding.\nFrankel also wants to promote the region’s access to fresh water, saying it can benefit industry and will become more attractive as climate change brings worsening drought to other parts of the country.\n\"If people have hope and opportunities for good jobs, we'll see a reduction in crime and violence,\" Frankel says. \"We'll see a reduction in poverty.\"\nDRILEY@Gannett.com\nSandra Frankel\nAge: 73.\nLives in: Brighton.\nHometown: Miami Beach, Florida.\nProfessional background: Brighton town supervisor, 1992-2012.\nSpeech language pathologist, 1968-1991\nFrankel Associates (photography business), 2012-present\nEducation: Newcomb College of Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana; bachelor’s degree, psychology and philosophy.\nNorthwestern University, Evanston, Illinois; master’s degree, speech pathology.\nStanford University and San Jose State College, California; graduate studies.\nOther experience: Ten years with the Monroe County School Boards Association.\nSix years on the Brighton school board.\nDemocratic nominee for lieutenant governor, 1998.\nDemocratic candidate for Monroe County executive, 2011.\nFamily: Married to Neil A.
