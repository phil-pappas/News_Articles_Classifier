There’s the group’s breakthrough 2008 release, “Scars and Souvenirs,” and its radio hits “I Hate My Life,” “Bad Girlfriend” and “All or Nothing.” That was followed by 2011’s “The Truth Is ...,” which went top 10 on Billboard’s Top 200 Albums Chart with No. 1 radio hit “Lowlife.” \nNevertheless, Connolly did point out that “Savages” includes a few changes for Theory of a Deadman. \n“Naturally, the last few records were fun,” Connolly said. “There was some heavier stuff, mostly with my writing was more tongue-in-cheek. With ‘Savages,’ I felt like I didn’t want to do that. Like the title track is something I haven’t done before where I just start talking about other people, the world, rather than just talking about the world as being BS, which I usually do. \n“I don’t know – it felt like we wanted to do something different, heavier, but it still felt really natural.” \nPart of that exploration ended up being the poppy song “Angel,” which was a No. 1 rock radio hit, and the stripped down “The One.’ \n“If you ask our fans, those are the songs they gravitate towards, and it’s not necessarily the heavy stuff like ‘Drown’ or ‘Savages,’” Connolly said. \nFans of a stripped down Theory of a Deadman were happy earlier this year when the group released an all-acoustic EP “Angel.” Connolly said in today’s fast-paced world, the music industry demands new material more frequently. \nInitially, he sounded as though he wasn’t a fan of the idea but, ultimately, admitted the label was right. The fans loved the EP. In fact, when it comes to releasing new material, he’s unsure what will come first, another EP or a full-length. \nAs far as the group’s return to the Mahoning Valley this Friday at Rodeo Music Hall in Austintown, Connolly said the outfit isn’t playing unplugged. Still, fans can expect to hear all of the group’s hits, including its calling-card track, “Bad Girlfriend.” \n“Yeah, we started seeing a lot more women at our show on the second record, and then ‘Bad Girlfriend’ kind of took it over the top,” Connolly said. “Unfortunately, it’s such a stripper song, so you get a lot of women who enjoy listening to the song because it makes them want to take their clothes off.” \nWhen asked if the group eschews writing a “stripper song” to avoid pigeonholing, Connolly laughed and said, “No because we only had one ‘Bad Girlfriend,’ but it would be a good problem to have. I don’t think we’d complain.” Other stories of interest", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:56:33.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
