The Cubs' road to the NLCS was paved by its talented, young hitters.\nIt's not just Mets' starters Matt Harvey, Noah Syndergaard and Jacob deGrom vs. Cubs' sluggers Anthony Rizzo, Kris Bryant, Kyle Schwarber and Jorge Soler.\nBut they all will be key players in the best-of-seven series that begins Saturday night with Harvey facing Jon Lester in Game 1 at Citi Field.\nWhich strategy will provide the quickest route to a World Series?\nWe're about to find out.\nThe number the Cubs can point to is seven — the number of games the two teams have played this year and the number of times the Cubs have beaten the Mets in 2015.\nThe Mets can counter that those seven games all took place before the All-Star break, rendering them meaningless. They went 41-24 from July 25 on, ranking first in the NL in runs (352) and second in the majors in home runs (100).\n\"We have a really different team,\" Harvey said. \"We have a different mentality. We have a lot of different pieces. We have heart. We have drive. We're not looking at what we did during the season.\nThe Cubs work out at New York's Citi Field.\n\"We have a completely different team and our motives are completely different. We're going back home and it's going to be tough for them to play at Citi Field, where it has been rocking.\"\nTougher than playing in Pittsburgh or St. Louis?\nDoubtful.\nManager Joe Maddon's video-board bangers seem unfazed by the postseason limelight. They have been playing with a joie de vivre all summer.\nThey set a postseason record against the Cardinals with six home runs in Game 3 of their NL Division Series, including three from rookies Bryant, Schwarber and Soler.\nDo these rookies understand the magnitude of what they have been doing?\n\"I don't think they do yet,\" Lester said. \"I think they're enjoying the ride, which I hope they continue to do and just have fun doing it. Really, you just have to jump on their backs and let them do their thing.\"\nJake Arrieta, the Cubs' Game 2 starter, said the young players have \"carried a lot of the weight\" during this dream-like run.\nCubs-Mets: NLCS predictions Mark Gonzales: Jon Lester and Jake Arrieta will be available to make two starts apiece if needed, and manager Joe Maddon will figure out a creative way to get through Games 3 and 4. Cubs in six games.\nDavid Haugh: This isn't revenge for 1969. This isn't anything other than a young team peaking...\nMark Gonzales: Jon Lester and Jake Arrieta will be available to make two starts apiece if needed, and manager Joe Maddon will figure out a creative way to get through Games 3 and 4. Cubs in six games.\nDavid Haugh: This isn't revenge for 1969. This isn't anything other than a young team peaking...\nRead the story \"It's exceptional to see four rookies do what they've done,\" Arrieta said. \"Having guys step up in big moments is what playoff teams are able to do. … The way they have stepped up and performed on a consistent basis, it's almost unheard of, and I think they can keep it up.\"\nThe Cubs-Mets rivalry has been somewhat muted since 1994, when MLB went from two divisions per league to three, separating the Cubs and Mets.\nFrom the '69 pennant race in which the Mets chased down the Cubs from 9 1/2 back through the late 1980s, the hatred was palpable, and it was easy to dislike Mets stars like Darryl Strawberry and Keith Hernandez.\nBut the millennials don't carry the grudges of their parents and grandparents, so now the Mets are just another team in the Cubs' way.\nAnd truth be told, this Mets team is enjoyable to watch and easy to like, with personable players like veteran Curtis Granderson, a Chicago-area native, and Daniel Murphy, the second baseman whose heads-up steal of third with no one covering the bag helped swipe the NLDS from the Dodgers on Thursday night.\nThe Mets' 66-year-old manager, Terry Collins, is also a nice story, and Maddon-esque in his own way with an inability to talk in cliches.\nAfter Thursday's victory in Los Angeles, Collins said he wasn't sure how his hitters would solve Dodgers starter Zack Greinke.\n\"You're looking at, in my opinion, some of the best pitching in all of baseball, and you're not going to score a lot of runs,\" Collins said. \"To sit there and try to maneuver and try to think how you might score? (Bleep!). I didn't know how we were going to score. So 'Murph' was invisible, and we wound up scoring that way.\"\nSo expect an intense matchup between two well-managed teams with plenty of young stars and diverse fan bases starving for success.\nIt's everything October promised, so drink it all in.\npsullivan@tribpub.com\nTwitter @PWSullivan\nPrivacy Policy Chicago Cubs Los Angeles Dodgers", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5621c3da/turbine/ct-predictions-cubs-mets-spt-1017-20151016", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5621d3ec/turbine/ct-cubs-practice-at-citi-field-photos-spt-20151016", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5621d851/turbine/ct-cubs-hitting-mets-pitching-sullivan-spt-1017-20151023"], "published": "2015-10-17T05:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:18:13.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
