Davis announced on Saturday that there are plans in the works, not just for a fifth \"Transformers\" but for a sixth, seventh and eighth.\nThe most recent, last year's \"Transformers: Age of Extinction\" made more than $1 billion at the worldwide box office (the first four have grossed close to $4 billion), so it's no wonder Hasbro and Paramount Pictures want to keep their cash cow going, whether the star is Shia LaBeouf, Mark Wahlberg or someone else. After all, the CGI robots are the real draw.\nAs for whether Michael Bay will return for a fifth time in the director's chair, that's still up in the air.\nThe news trended quickly over the weekend and Twitter users made their views known:\nHasbro confirms not one, not two, not three, but four more Transformers movies on the way. God have mercy on our souls.\n— Bob Repass (@BobTrek) October 4, 2015 Four more Transformers films? I honestly don't know if I have that much hate left in me.\n— Dawn of the Ed (@EdwinJDavies) October 4, 2015 Make America Great Again: Stop Going To See 'Transformers' Movies.\n— Rusty Redenbacher (@rustymk2) October 4, 2015 Though not everyone was against the idea:\nI don't care how dumb the plots of the Transformers movies get, I'll always watch them.
