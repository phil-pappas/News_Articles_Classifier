Features showcase locations connected to the silent cinema, beginning with \"Flicker Highway: American Road's Silent Movie Route.\" The 370-mile path through Nebraska , Kansas , and Missouri unearths the Midwest's movie roots-from Harold Lloyd's Birthplace to the hometown of Louise Brooks , the Buster Keaton Museum, and the first house ever frequented by Mickey Mouse . It's ambitious, enormous, and assuredly the first attempt ever made to frame this region with regard to its filmic past. American Road ® is honored to present the premiere.\n\"Silent Era Films,\" a reel retrospective that trains a spotlight on early automobile films such as Wallace Reid's speedy romance, The Roaring Road (1919), as well as Mabel Normand's triumphant turn in Mabel at the Wheel (1914). Road departments continue the trend, following Will Rogers along Route 66, Lillian Gish on the Lincoln Highway, and Charlie Chaplin across US 101. Production wraps up with an installment of \"The Extra Mile\" that visits the Laurel and Hardy Museum of Harlem, Georgia , before cueing the final fade-out.\nAbout American Road\nAmerican Road ® is an award-winning periodical published quarterly by Mock Turtle Press, distributed internationally by Disticor, and available at newsstands and fine bookstores. American Road ® also offers a digital edition and an iTunes app for the iPad.\nTo preview the Summer 2015 issue, visit:\nhttp://mydigimag.rrd.com/publication/?i=262547 .\n releases/american-roads-summer-2015-issue-the-sound-of-silents-named-as-a-finalist-in-mins-2015-editorial-and-design-awards-300163619.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/american-roads-summer-2015-issue-the-sound-of-silents-named-as-a-finalist-in-mins-2015-editorial-and-design-awards-300163619.html", "http://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/american-road-magazine/id439220079?mt=8", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DE30936&Transmission_Id=201510211017PR_NEWS_USPR_____DE30936&DateId=20151021", "http://mydigimag.rrd.com/publication/?i=262547"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:38:18.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
