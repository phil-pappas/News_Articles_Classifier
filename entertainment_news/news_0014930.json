Calvary Day improved to 30-9 with the victory and will host the winner of Mount Vernon/Paideia on Tuesday.\nSouthern Britt, a libero, got things off to a fast start by reeeling off nine straight service points, including a pair of aces as Calvary jumped out to a 10-3 lead in the first set. The Cavs never looked back, taking the first game 25-6 en route to a three-set sweep of Brookstone.\n“I thought our serving in the first set really set the tone for the match,” Hunter said. “Looking back at the Savannah Christian match, we made a lot of service errors.\nThat’s all about mental focus. It’s kind of like shooting free throws in basketball. I thought we served very well today, and it’s helped us gain the momentum and pull away to win the match.”\nLexie Pitts had a strong service run to end the first set, and Britt picked up right where she left off in the second set with a pair of aces. Talia Hatch was impressive with her serving, too, notching five aces on the night.\nThe service game was strong for the Cavaliers, but the impressive hitting by outside hitter Claudia Chisolm provided the most memorable moments of the match. The 5-foot-9 junior was a machine at the net, slamming home some spectacular kills.\n“It’s fun setting Claudia because I know she is going to swing away and put the ball down,” said Calvary setter Hannah Carver, who had 35 assists and four aces in the match. “I feel like all our hard work is paying off when she makes a kill.”\nChisolm had 14 kills and two aces, keeping the Brookstone defense off balance all day.\n“It seems like something has been clicking with our team in the last couple weeks,” Chisolm said. “Everyone has been making contributions. Hannah (Carver) is a great setter; she puts the ball exactly where I want it.”\nChisolm was right about getting excellent play from throughout the lineup. Sara Daniels had a big match with 10 kills, while Britt added five digs and six aces. Jessica Lanier showed her versatility playing all over the court, and freshman Madison Sprosty added six digs and two aces.\nNow the Cavaliers will prepare to host their second-round match.\n“That win over Savannah Christian gave us a lot of confidence,” Chisolm said. “I think we can go all the way.”", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14812846.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14812846.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T16:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:14:57.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
