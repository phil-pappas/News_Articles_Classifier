Colton Ave., Redlands\nAdmission: $15-$70\nInformation: 909-748-8018; redlandssymphony.com .\nConductor Jon Robertson will conduct three more concerts with Redlands Symphony Orchestra before he retires, and the season opening concert on Saturday, Oct. 17 at Memorial Chapel on the University of Redlands campus will be the first of the three. For the program, Robertson has selected only two works: Shostakovich’s Cello Concerto No. 1 and Beethoven's Symphony No. 8.\n“This is a very energetic concert,” said Redlands Symphony Orchestra General Manager Chris Myers. “The pulse starts and never stops.”\nRobertson, who will lead a pre-concert talk at 7:15 p.m. Saturday evening, referred to the Shostakovich concerto as intense and Beethoven’s symphony as playful, a juxtaposition which will not be lost on the listener. Still, Myers said, they are both about energy.\n“While the pieces are from different periods and express different moods, they are both full of life,” Myers said. “The Shostakovich piece is, as the composer was, conflicted in its emotions while Beethoven's work is full of ebullient joy, with a constant pulse.”\nCellist Doniyor Zuparov will perform the Shostakovich concerto which is considered one of the most difficult works for cello soloists in the standard repertoire, according to Robertson. Zuparov has performed as soloist with Uzbekistan Chamber Orchestra, Turkistan Chamber Orchestra, National Symphonic Orchestra, MTC Orchestra, Conservatory Students Symphonic Orchestra, and the Conservatory Students Chamber Orchestra. He was principal cellist of the symphonic and chamber orchestras of the State Conservatory of Uzbekistan, and is currently studying for his Masters of Music as a student at the Lynn University Conservatory of Music in Florida.\nAccording to the program notes by James Keays, the concerto was written for cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, and is full of virtuosic demands on the soloist, including a plethora of runs and double stops and left hand pizzicato. Myers said the piece expresses much of the angst that Shostakovich himself felt as a composer in the Soviet Union in 1959.\nBeethoven composed his eighth symphony in 1812 and premiered it at the same concert with his Symphony No. 7, according to Myers. Reportedly, Beethoven considered the Symphony No. 8 as far superior to No. 7, and Keays‘ program notes suggest that it is one of Beethoven's most mature and inspired masterpieces.\n“Robertson has conducted all of Beethoven's symphonies with Redlands Symphony Orchestra throughout his tenure as conductor, and this will be the fifth time he has conducted Symphony No. 8,” said Myers. “Because it’s in a major key and expresses a joyful mood, it is sometimes not appreciated for its extraordinary quality.”\nContact the writer: features@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw8kvi-b88540513z.120151014174511000g0ucj4ta.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw8kvh-b88540513z.120151014174511000g0ucj4t6.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw8kvh-b88540513z.120151014174511000g0ucj4t6.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw8kvi-b88540513z.120151014174511000g0ucj4ta.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:31:01.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
