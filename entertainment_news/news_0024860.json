Rough Cut (no reporter narration).   \nROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) China's flamboyant pianist Lang Lang and the legendary Cuban pianist Chucho Valdes played together during a rehearsal in Havana, ahead of a unique concert that will take place on Friday (October 9), dedicated to the 500th anniversary of the Cuban capital. It is the first time the Chinese pianist has traveled to Cuba and also played with pianist and composer, Valdes, considered one of the most important musicians on the island. \"It's incredible for me to come to Cuba for the first time. I know Havana, the city, from films, from books, from movies, from the internet, for so many years, and such a beautiful city and tomorrow's concert is going to be very special, because we are marking the city of Havana's 500 years of celebration and to be in the same concert with my good friend Chucho Valdes and playing Cuban music, in Havana, that's going to be something,\" Lang said. Lang and Valdes rehearsed on Thursday (October 8) for the concert which will be offered by the National Symphony Orchestra of Cuba, this time led by the American Marin Alsop, the music director of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. Valdes said he was very excited. \"A treat to have an artist of the stature of Lang Lang doing a concert here, on the 500th anniversary of the city of Havana, the founding of the city of Havana and the people, it's good, the public is very excited, everyone wants to see the concert, wants to see Lang Lang, the Symphony and what we're going to do, so this is going to be incredible,\" Valdes said. Lang Lang's global profile has risen rapidly in recent years as he played sold-out recitals around the world and his album sales ranked him as a best-selling classical musician. He gave his first public recital at the age of five and when he was nine he entered Beijing's Central Music Conservatory. Lang Lang left China at 15 to study at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, with his big break coming two years later when he played with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Valdes, who has won five Grammy awards over his musical career and founded jazz group Irakere, is one of the most important figures in the history of Cuban jazz music.  //reut.rs/1ZmrsXo", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:55:31.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
