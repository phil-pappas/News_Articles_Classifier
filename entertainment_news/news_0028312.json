The Concert Orchestra’s program, directed by James Kilgus, includes pieces by Dvorak, Holst, Gabriel Musella and the late Greenville composer Dwight Gustafson. \nThe Symphony Orchestra will take portions of Sunday’s program to Carnegie Hall in March. \nFor the Carnegie program, the orchestra is also commissioning an original work by Jay Bocook, director of athletic bands at Furman University. In New York City, the orchestra will be featured with other ensembles from around the country. \nA trip to the storied Carnegie Hall never fails to inspire and impress the orchestra’s young musicians, Hicken said. \n“My favorite part of the trip is when the students walk onstage for the dress rehearsal for the first time,” said Hicken, who is also the longtime director of bands and professor of music education at Furman University. “They walk out in awe.” \nWhile in New York, the Carolina Youth Symphony always finds time to take its young musicians to a Broadway show as well as to Chinatown for shopping and Little Italy for a bite to eat. \nFor the latest in local arts news and reviews, follow Paul Hyde on Facebook and Twitter: @PaulHyde7. \nYOU CAN GO \nWhat: Carolina Youth Symphony’s Season-Opening Concert \nWhen: 5 p.m. Sunday \nWhere: Peace Center Concert Hall \nTickets: $10 adults; $5 students \nInformation: 864-467-3000 or www.peacecenter.org 11 CONNECT 7 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://grnol.co/1LSPhQI MORE STORIES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T01:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:55:37.576+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
