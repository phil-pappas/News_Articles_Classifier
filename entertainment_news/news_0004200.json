She uses paint and mixed media, with an emphasis on bright colours, to express the energy and movement of her surroundings. \nAlison Orchard is based in Grayshott, on the Hampshire-Surrey border. She is a strong believer in painting direct from the landscape, and creates works in oil, acrylic and mixed media. \nMatt Forster lives in Hexham, Northumberland, where he has his studio and gallery. His watercolour landscapes and seascapes are widely collected and his unique, so-called ‘Überpainting’ interpretations of trees, rivers, moors, mountains and even cottages and sheep have made his work highly distinctive and recognisable. Share article \nThe Town & Country Gallery exhibition will showcase a selection of each of their work on Sunday, Thursday and next Saturday and Sunday. \n* Visit rownhamshouse.com Exhibition to showcase best of art inspired by British coast and countryside Sorry, an error occurred.
