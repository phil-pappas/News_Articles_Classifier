Photo: Fiona Morris \nIt's never too late to be a rock'n'roll star. Or too early, in fact. \nJust ask percussionist Bree van Reyk, who has launched her own school of rock across schools  in the Campbelltown area.\nVan Reyk,  who is Campbelltown Arts Centre's artist in residence this year, has been teaching high school girls the art of rock'n'roll in a project designed to encourage them to embrace their musical aspirations.\nThe project, named Massive Band, is exactly that. On Saturday the culmination of months of work will see about 70 women of all ages play a 25-minute set at the arts centre.\nAdvertisement \"I really hope that people can see that it's never too late to play music,\" says van Reyk. \"Although a lot of the project is focused on high school girls, I've also been having open workshops which have been a call out to any women who want to come and play.\n\"I hear a lot of women saying, 'Oh, I wish I'd played the drums, or I wish I'd played guitar', and I just think just do it. It's really easy, you've just got to give it a go.\"\nThe willing musicians have been tutored under the careful watch of van Reyk and some of her musical acquaintances – Lindy Morrison and Amanda Brown from the Go-Betweens, bassist Zoe Hauptmann, drummer Alison Galloway from Smudge and guitarist Jess Green.\nVan Reyk, who has collaborated with Paul Kelly, Holly Throsby and Sarah Blasko, has been playing drums since the age of 10 and says she wants to encourage more girls to take up music.\nShe says boys can often be a lot more competitive and confident in taking things on, whereas girls can be more likely to be intimidated.\n\"It's really great just to be able to show them that they can do it,\" she says. \"Especially with rock'n'roll, so much is made up by people who are not formally trained musicians.\n\"The feedback has been really great from the girls. The energy I've been getting from the workshops, they're really excited and they're really willing and they're really open to trying things. They don't have too many limitations on what they can do. It's just a really supportive environment of other girls and women.\"\nVan Reyk has been working with students from Thomas Reddall High School, Holroyd High School, St Patrick's College and Campbelltown Performing Arts High School in workshops throughout  the year. \nOn Saturday, the set will include an improvised piece based on a composition by van Reyk, plus versions of Wild Thing , Aretha Franklin's Respect and Patti Smith's Gloria .\nVan Reyk says it was important that the songs have a positive message. \"So many songs are like, 'Oh, baby I miss you, and I want you back', and stuff like that and I didn't want any songs that had that kind of connotation.\n\"Patti Smith is an amazing role model and an amazing artist and I wanted to introduce these high school girls to people like Aretha Franklin and Patti Smith so they can see beyond the current pop climate, and investigate this really long legacy of amazing women musicians.\"\nOn the day, she estimates there will be eight or nine drummers, 25 guitar players and a mix of keyboard and wind instrument players and singers.\nIt's not too late to sign up, the only prerequisite is that people attend the dress rehearsal on Saturday and register via email.\n\"Just come along. We'd love to see anyone there who's ever wanted to play in a band – now's your chance.\"\nMassive Band is at the Campbelltown Arts Centre on Saturday, October 17. Dress rehearsal is at 1pm, the concert is at 5.30pm, register at 4645 4100,  info@c-a-c.com.au , free.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:28:16.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
