The day the Queen of Topaz refuses to take her potion, Sandar will never be the same. My fantasy/sci-fi novel, TOPAZ , has now been published!\nWhat began as a short story soon turned into a full length novel, which has taken me ten months to finish. It blends black holes and portals with a medieval world of fantasy with magicians. I don't claim to be a hard core sci-fi writer, but I have kept the scientific part of the novel as accurate or believable as possible. The rest is pure imagination.\nIt is easy reading, which should be attractive to all sci-fi/fantasy fans, including young adults (YA category).\nSnowdonia will be next, followed by Monstera; Hydra and Moss. Shade will be the concluding story of the series.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T17:35:07.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
