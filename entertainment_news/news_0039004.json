They help me. So the fact that I am 14 years old is not really an issue.\"\nMechetner, who used to help her mother clean houses to make ends meet, was catapulted into the limelight in July when she opened Dior's haute couture show wearing a sheer white dress.\nHer appearance drew criticism and stirred the debate on where to draw the age line in fashion, an industry often criticized for using skinny models.\n\"Before she started with Dior, she was cleaning houses with her mother. So if she is not too young to clean houses, I don't think she is too young to walk on a show,\" Mechetner's agent Rotem Gur said.\nThe use of young models in fashion is not new. Kate Moss was scouted at 14 while Naomi Campbell was 15.\nCelebrity offspring have also modeled young - Romeo Beckham, son of soccer player David Beckham, starred in a Burberry campaign at 12.\nHowever there have been industry moves to make changes, notably during the biannual catwalk shows. Designers contracted to London Fashion Week must use models aged 16 or over. New York has similar age guidelines.\n\"In Italy we don't use models under 16,\" Carlo Capasa, head of Italy's Fashion Chamber, said.\nIn Paris, the focus this year has been health, with France passing a law banning excessively thin models.\n\"I think you should start modeling at 18,\" British model Neelam Gill, 20, said. \"I cannot imagine going all around the world on your own. It would be so much pressure.\"\nDior has not publicly commented on Mechetner's employment and other maisons have also used teenage models. Lily-Rose Depp, actor Johnny Depp's 16-year old daughter, models Chanel eyewear.\n\"That's the way people want to see (clothes). The public wants to see them on girls like this. They can identify even if it's not the same age group,\" designer Karl Lagerfeld said. \"That's the girls of the moment. Fashion is about the moment.\"\n(Reporting By Johnny Cotton in Paris, Marie-Louise Gumuchian in Milan, Alicia Powell in New York and Basmah Fahim and Jane Witherspoon in London; Editing by Tom Heneghan )\nModel Sofia Mechetner presents a creation by Belgian designer Raf Simons as part of his Spring/Summer 2016 women's ready-to-wear collection for Christian Dior fashion house in Paris, France, October 2, 2015.
