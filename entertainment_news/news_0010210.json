During the Powerhouse 2015 concert at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, Fetty performed sitting on a golden throne with his injured leg held up. Fetty performed his hit songs including \"Trap Queen\", \"679\", \"My Way\" and \"Again\". Other headliners included Kendrick Lamar , Future , Big Sean , Rick Ross and Meek Mill , whose girlfriend Nicki Minaj stood onstage as he performed. Fetty apologized for being confined to sitting throughout the concert and thanked fans for their support. At the end of his performance, the rapper stood up with two of his friends holding him up, telling the crowd that he hadn't performed in two months or walked in a month. \"I'm a stand up for y'all. I appreciate y'all for having me,\" Fetty said. \"This (accident) was real scary, you feel me, I ain't going to even lie. If I (mess) up, don't worry about it.\" He then offered words of encouragement who aspire to succeed in music in the future. \"I swear to God I never thought ['Trap Queen'] would bring me this far and I say that to say that this (stuff) ain't hard. If you really want to do this (stuff), get up, hit up the studio, and do what you do, man,\" he shared, \"If you have that talent, put that work in.\" Fetty got into an accident while riding his motorbike in his hometown of Paterson, New Jersey back in September. He broke his legs in three places and had to cancel some concert dates following the crash. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T02:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:08:01.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
