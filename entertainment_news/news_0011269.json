The actor was busy in promotions of his Friday release Bruce Lee and when he was asked to react on the comments of Dasari in one of the interviews, he explained the situation subtly. \n\"We have no clue that Rudramadevi is releasing before us until it actually released, if we know it any time before, we should have definitely moved our release. But now we cannot do anything as a lot of business is involved and it is our producer's call completely. I have nothing to do with it.\", Ram Charan tried to explain. \nTalking at the success meet of Rudramadevi, Dasari suggested that Bruce Lee should think of a later date as big films like it doesn't really need a festive season to make enough money. \nDasari further questioned, why they were hurrying up for a release and doubted if it is some kind of revenge, which actually triggered a controversy. \nApparently, Charan had already reacted once on the clash, before Dasari coming into the picture. The actor recalled that they announced the date 8 months in prior and it is not their fault if other films come for a clash.
