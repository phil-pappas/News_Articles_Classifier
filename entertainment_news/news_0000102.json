Brent Pogue Collection.\nAmong the stars of the sale was a 1794 Flowing Hair Silver Dollar, known as the Lord Saint Oswald specimen. It sold for nearly $5 million, in line with its high presale estimate.\nAnother highlight was a 1795 Capped Bust Right Eagle, also known as the Garrett Eagle. The $10 gold piece sold for $2.5 million, setting a new record for any pre-Gold Rush United States gold coin sold at public auction.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
