Of course Sarah is a constant mess of nerves at the moment and desperately wants to confide in someone, but will she? Also tonight, the police call at Number 8 and quiz David, Kylie and Sarah about Callum's whereabouts, explaining that he has skipped bail. David assures them they'll be in touch if they hear anything, while Kylie and Sarah struggle to contain their fear. Consumed with guilt, Kylie and Sarah wonder if they'd be better off confessing all to the police, but David insists they stick to their story. Elsewhere, Fiz and Tyrone wait nervously in the hospital while Hope has her operation, while Johnny and Kate start work at the factory.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T02:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:30:51.379+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
