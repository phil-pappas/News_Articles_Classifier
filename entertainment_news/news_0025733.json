The cauliflower brûlée had everyone asking \"what's this?\" and the killer wines, supplied by LoHi's Amendment XXI liquors, were making \"red or white?\" feel like the most important choice of a lifetime.\nElissa Auther, curator of the \"Dirty/Pretty\" exhibit currently at the MCA Denver. The art auction went on with only a few odd moments: A Christo print sold for three times its value at $17,000. And for some reason, museum trustee Karl Kister spent $4,000 on a painting that was lost in transit and unlikely to be found. \"You may or may not get it,\" auctioneer Gary Corbett warned. Maybe it was generosity that got Kister in the spirit, or maybe it was his suit, a school-bus yellow number, dotted with pink and purple flowers.\nAdvertisement There were just a few speeches and none of them too boring. Board chairman Mike Fries announced a pair of future exhibitions, one by Jean-Michel Basquiat, another by Georgia O'Keeffe (At the MCA? Whatever), though he mostly pointed out the good work museum director Adam Lerner and his team do, working relentlessly with teens and exhibiting exciting art from around the globe. Photographers Mark Sink and Kristin Hatgi Sink at the MCA Denver's Luminocity gala.\n\"This is not just my favorite organization in Denver. I think it's one of the most important,\" said Fries, also the board chairman of Denver's Biennial of the Americas, probably his second favorite organization.\nEven the group shot of tequila — it's mandatory at this event — went down without any memorable rowdiness on the unfinished fourth floor of the under-construction Triangle Building downtown.\nBut then came the final auction item of the night — and the strip down. It was a piece by Mark Mothersbaugh , the artist and rock musician (He is Devo!) who exhibited at the MCA last year.\nErin Trapp, who directs the Biennial of the Americas, and David Dadone, who heads the Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art. Mothersbaugh contributed a print depicting Adam Lerner himself, his head covered in slime. Development director Michael McNeill appeared on stage to announce Lerner would actually get slimed before the crowd if the work sold. It did, for $10,000.\nLerner removed his bow tie, then his shirt, then his pants to reveal the skin-tight, leopard-print, muscleman suit he'd been wearing underneath. It wasn't exactly a fashion-forward moment for the director, but not so bad either — no embarrassing bulges, anywhere. Of course, the green, gooey slime came pouring down, right over Lerner's head and trademark eyeglasses, and things got a little messy.\nThat was the night. Except for some more drinking. Then a lot of dancing. The MCA's gala is more fun than any other.\nRay Mark Rinaldi: 303-954-1540, rrinaldi@denverpost.com or @rayrinaldi", "external_links": ["http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxMileHigh-Adam-Lerner-The-Ar", "http://www.listenproductions.com/?team=karl", "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/1023/20151023__20151024_C1_AE24STMCA~p4_200.jpg", "http://www.amendment21wines.com/", "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/1023/20151023__20151024_C1_AE24STMCA~p5_200.jpg", "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/1023/20151023__20151024_C1_AE24STMCA~p3_200.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-24T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:43:36.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
