Welcome, then, to The Lobster, a future set drama where it is against the law to be single. Loners are hunted, and getting caught means being turned into an animal that has two choices - eat or be eaten. The Lobster stays in the pot for too long, but an all star cast, including Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, and Scotland’s Ashley Jensen, plus a surreally funny screenplay mining all the madness of the concept, makes this a Lanthimos collectors’ item. Winner of the jury prize at Cannes, with another award, the Palm Dog, for a certain charismatic Collie.\nCrimson Peak (15)\nthree stars\nDir: Guillermo del Toro\nWith: Tom Hiddleston, Mia Wasikowska\nRuntime: 119 minutes\nHEADING your way for Halloween is Guillermo del Toro’s period chiller, a film that is not so much Hammer than out and out hammy, but enjoyably so. Opening in frontiers America, Mia Wasikowska plays a young lady with a fortune who comes to the attention of creepy English siblings Thomas and Lucille Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston and Jessica Chastain). Why are they so interested in this fair damsel? Screamingly over the top, with del Toro’s trademark sumptuous visuals to the fore.\nx-ref: Tom Hiddleston interview - page xx\nHotel Transylvania 2 (U)\nthree stars\nDir: Genndy Tartakovsky\nVoices: Adam Sandler, Selena Gomez\nShare article Runtime: 89 minutes\nADAM Sandler, Steve Buscemi and pals return for more animated movie fun set around the home from home for monsters (and a few humans) in spooky old Transylvania. It’s three years on, the Count’s daughter Mavis is hitched to a mortal, and the patter of tiny feet is about to interrupt proceedings. What will it be, a boy or a girl, a vamp or a human? Genndy Tartakovsky’s caper is nicely left field, with sly humour and enough silliness for all ages.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-15T07:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T06:22:00.830+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
