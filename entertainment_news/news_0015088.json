He ran away from home several times in the 1950s and 60s, found \"family\" through drug use, and got an education in how to succeed in crime while imprisoned in a California State facility for youths. From San Francisco to Monterey to San Diego , Huff sat atop mountains of cash and squandered it many times over a 20-year, yo-yo lifestyle of binging and purging on heroin and crack cocaine.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151019/278160\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151019/278161\nHuff's first book, Handcuffs to Broken Chains, published by Colossus Publishing, details his growing up and drug-riddled adult years, hard time in Chino Men's Prison, and employment in a counterfeit ring which made him one of the FBI's most wanted criminals in Las Vegas in the 1990s.\nIn 2003 at age 51, Huff was homeless on the hot, grimy streets of the casino city, washing car windows for drug money. After three years of living under an oleander bush in a city park and spending every dollar on drugs, Huff was so hungry that he feasted on scraps out of a stinking dumpster behind a restaurant. The utter shame of that moment was a turning point in his life.\nToday, Huff is the go-to person in the Las Vegas area when it comes to dealing with the rampant homeless issue. He volunteers as an advocate at city hall, works with law enforcement, and has spearheaded Broken Chains Ministry, a non-profit organization with the sole purpose of feeding and clothing the \"least of these\" and giving them dignity.\nHuff's drastic turnaround from a gun-toting, drug-using biker and outlaw to a Christian and finally an ordained pastor is documented in his riveting book, available now on Amazon . Every penny of the proceeds goes back into Broken Chains Ministry. Huff and his wife are retired, yet not paid through their ministry for their efforts on behalf of the homeless; they live on their combined Social Security income.\nAbout Cody Huff\nPastor Cody Huff's life story is so compelling that he has appeared as a character in three of author Jud Wilhite's books, and had an entire chapter dedicated to him in popular Christian author Lee Strobel's latest book, The Case for Grace . He has been a guest speaker at megachurches Woodlands Church in Houston , and Parkview Christian Church in Orland Park, Illinois , and others. Lee Strobel wrote the Foreword for Handcuffs to Broken Chains .\nCody Huff is available for interviews at 702-265-2603, Email , and www.vegasbrokenchains.org/contact-us/\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/former-homeless-man-has-book-published-300162672.html\nÂ©2015 PR Newswire.
