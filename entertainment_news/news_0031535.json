(Photo: Detroit Free Press) \nThere’s more to pumpkin beer than commercially spiced exploitation of a historic American gourd. \nThe popular flavor has inspired breweries to use the vegetal notes of actual pumpkin and brew beers ranging from dark and bold to IPA-level hoppy and even sour — well, after trying 11 of them, especially sour. \nLa Parcela by Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales, brewed in Dexter, stood out from the rest with a complex blend with flavors like lemon, cherry and oak combined with pumpkin. I recommend the bottled version over the draft. \nBut what’s really surprising is how many breweries bothered to use actual pumpkins. Unlike the pumpkin spice-flavored Peeps (never again!), Oreos, instant oatmeal and Hershey’s Kisses, breweries making all but one of the beers I tried proudly stated that pumpkins were part of the recipe. \nPerhaps it’s a nod to the role of the pumpkin in American beer history. Colonists from Europe arrived on the eastern shores to find a place lacking fields of barley, wheat and other grains readily available back home. And with clean drinking water also tough to find, beer was especially important. \nScreamin’ Pumpkin, left, Jaw-Jacker Ale, Pumking, Hooligan Hoppy Pumpkin Ale and La Parcela. (Photo: Jessica J. Trevino/Detroit Free Press) \n“They pulled into port, saw orange vegetables and said, ‘You know what? We could probably use those to brew beer,’” said Bobby Vedder, a certified cicerone with Powers Distributing, which distributes beverages in Oakland and Macomb counties. \nJeff Alworth in “The Beer Bible,” a book published earlier this year, describes it like this: \n“The humble pumpkin, totem of Halloween ... was used by American colonists to make rough beer for those who could not afford the good imported stuff. ... Finding suitable sugars for yeast to digest into beer was always a chore for those early colonists.” \nPumpkin beers over time declined in popularity before the resurgence of craft breweries in the late 20th Century led to the novelty seasonal beer. But Vedder points out that pumpkins usually haven’t matured in July or August when pumpkin beer is made ahead of the fall season. \n“A lot of them use the spices or just canned pumpkin,” he said. \nBut some breweries are clearly taking pride in their pumpkin beers. Vedder recommends that people who don’t like pumpkin beer try Hooligan from North Peak Brewing (master brewer Ron Jeffries makes this beer as well as La Parcela; the two breweries are separated only by a hallway). \n“It has this body and mouthfeel of a pumpkin beer, but if we’re being honest with each other, this is an IPA,” he said. “You’re getting that vegetal flavor, but you’re also getting this beautiful, beautiful hop performance.” \nBecause pumpkin beer doesn’t taste like most craft beer, and because it often has ridiculous levels of cinnamon, nutmeg and other spices, it’s easy to find craft-beer drinkers who detest it. \n“OK, you’re on Beer Advocate and rated 10,000 beers, and you only drink Heady Topper,” rated one of the top beers on Beer Advocate, Vedder said. “Maybe this pumpkin beer’s not for you. But for the million other drinkers in that zip code, this is super approachable.” \nIt’s fun, whimsical, and if you bring a 12-pack of an IPA and a 12-pack of pumpkin beer to a Halloween party, “I guarantee you that that pumpkin beer is going to go first,” he said. \nIn hopes of giving you a better idea which pumpkin beer is worth tasting, here’s a list with my immediate reactions. And yeah, I gave Jaw-Jacker Ale by Arcadia Brewing a 3.5/5 even though it’s one of those inauthentic spice-minus-pumpkin beers. Because it tasted nice — cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg and all. Craft beers tasted, ranked and reviewed \n(as rated on Untappd, profile: raDetroit): \nLa Parcela (5.9% alcohol by volume) by Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales: Great sour approach to pumpkin beer with flavors of lemon, raw pumpkin, oak, sour cherry and some grapefruit on the back end. 4.5/5 \nScreamin’ Pumpkin (5% ABV) by Griffin Claw Brewing: Nice pumpkin brew with spices, cloves, caramel malts, quite noticeable allspice. 3.75/5 \nWilhelm Scream (5.4% ABV) by Magic Hat Brewing: Nicely balanced flavors, though on the lighter side. Some spice and pumpkin, as is expected with (this) genre. 3/5* \nScreamin' Pumpkin by Griffin Claw Brewing Company. Pumpkin beers photographed on location at 8 Degrees Plato Beer Company on Cass Avenue in Detroit, Tuesday, October 2, 2015. (Photo: Detroit Free Press) \nJaw-Jacker Ale (6% ABV) by Arcadia Brewing: Spicy, crisp, earthy, dark-bready malts. Cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg all quite noticeable. 3.5/5 \nImperial Pumpkin Ale (8% ABV) by Weyerbacher Brewing: Clove-cardamom spice flavors stick out, with nutmeg and cinnamon also clearly noticeable with a nice caramel flavor and pumpkin. 3.5/5 \nHooligan - Hoppy Pumpkin Ale (5.5% ABV) by North Peak Brewing: Tastes like a floral, piney pale ale; can barely taste pumpkin. 3.25/5 \nPumking (8.6% ABV) by Southern Tier Brewing: Banana-bread flavor that kind of tastes like pumpkin-pie crust. Noticeable alcohol, nutmeg finish. 3.25/5 \nUnicorn Killer (7.3% ABV) by Greenbush Brewing: Bold, sharply spicy, little pumpkin flavors with earthiness. Some black pepper. Interesting. 3.25/5 \nIchabod Ale (5.2% ABV) by New Holland Brewing: More pumpkin than spice. Quite light-tasting on the back end. Flavor disappears quickly. 2.5/5 \nSamuel Adams Fat Jack Double Pumpkin (8.5% ABV) by Boston Beer: Heavy, complex with tastes of toast, coffee, vanilla and only the slightest hints of spice and maybe pumpkin. 2.25/5 \nPumpkin Wheat (5.1% ABV) by Shock Top Brewing: Mass-produced light beer with a hint of pumpkin spice. 1.25/5. \nSpirits of Detroit columnist Robert Allen covers alcohol for the Free Press.
