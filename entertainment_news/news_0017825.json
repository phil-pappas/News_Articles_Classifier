Written by: Chaitra Published: Wednesday, October 21, 2015, 10:27 [IST] \nDaniel Radcliffe, the 26 years old actor, who once played the epic role of Harry Potter, recently spoke about the much adult stuff, like flirting, girlfriend, masturbation and alcohol issues and may other things during his interview with the Playboy magazine. \nThe 1.65 m tall British actor opened about his struggles dealing with fame, young age drinking , his inability to say 'no', and everything about his 8 Harry Potter series. He also used the platform to talk about his girlfriend Erin Darke. \nDaniel did a 20 Q and A with Playboy. Below are a few of the questions and Daniel's brilliant answers combined with his simple and down to earth attitude that caught our attention. We must say, the actor does have an excellent sense of humour. \nDaniel said: \nOn when he drank heavily at a very young age to deal with fame .. \n\"Anytime I'd go out to dance, camera phones would come out. That would make me very self-conscious, and what's the easiest way to escape being self-conscious? Alcohol is a quick way of doing that. So it was related in that way.\" \nHe also added \"A few years ago there was a TV ad that showed a lot of inventors, including a guy who invented the camera phone. He was smiling smugly into the camera, and I was just like, Fuck you. What have you wrought? Camera phones are definitely not my favorite.\" \nOn whether there was time to masturbate on the sets \nDaniel jokingly said, \"Yeah, I was like every other teenager in that sense. My favorite line about masturbation is Louis C.K.'s, something like, \"I found out about it when I was 11, and I didn't skip a day.\" I think I started very early-before my teens. But not when I was on set.\" \nOn his height issues in Hollywood .. \nThe actor said, \"I don't think so. Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise have very different careers, and they're both about the same height as I am. I could play a soldier. The minimum height for a marine is five feet, and I'm well above that. If you're asking, â€˜Can you play a really (bleeping) tall person?' No, obviously not.\" \nOn when he first met his girlfriend and flirting .. \nDaniel gushed about his incredibly smart and funny girlfriend. He spoke about the time he first met her on the sets in 2013 and said \"That's a wonderful record of us flirting for the first time. There's no acting going on - not from my end, anyway. There's a moment when she makes me laugh, and I'm laughing as me and not as my character.\" \nFrom height to masturbating and gushing about his girlfriend, Daniel rocked the interview and nailed every single question he was asked. He can now look forward to seeing the Harry Potter protagonist in many other roles in the near future and add more fiction characters to our list of favorites.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:19:33.641+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
