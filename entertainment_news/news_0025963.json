By Elaine Schmidt Special To The Journal Sentinel , Special to the Journal Sentinel Oct. 16, 2015 11:00 a.m. (0) Comments Paul Mitchell Wild Space Dance Company will perform its site-specific “Luminous” concerts Oct. 22-24 in the new Mitchell Park Horticultural Conservatory Annex, adjacent to the Domes. \nIf you're interested in finding striking, out-of-the way indoor and outdoor spaces in Milwaukee, just follow Debra Loewen around. \nLoewen, artistic director of Wild Space Dance Company, has staged modern dance performances atop a Pabst Brewery parking garage, with the twinkling city skyline as a backdrop, in the haunting interior and exterior spaces of the Milwaukee County Historical Society building, and in the surprisingly wild Three Bridges Park in Menomonee Valley. \nThe unlikely venues are not just places to stage dance works; they are an integral part of Loewen's site-specific works. \nLoewen's most recent we-must-dance-there site is a newly constructed, 10,000-square-foot greenhouse called the Mitchell Park Horticultural Conservatory Annex. It and six other greenhouses are adjacent to the park's Domes. \n\"We got public occupancy just a few weeks ago,\" said Sandy Folaron, Domes director. \"Deb is going to be one of the first groups to use the space. She is going to tell us what works and what doesn't.\" This will also give Folaron a chance to learn what sort of cleanup will be involved and what sort of staffing is required. \nCalling it a \"breathtaking space,\" Folaron said the greenhouse stands on its own and is accessible with or without the Domes. \n\"This allows us to expand the activities we have here,\" she said. \"The only other space we have is the lobby.\" \nFor Loewen, a gardener, the greenhouse is a natural fit. \n\"I just love botanical gardens,\" she said. \"I love traveling to see them.\" But her interest in botanical gardens does not necessarily make them a good place to dance. \n\"It would not be easy to do a performance inside the Domes,\" she said. \"You would be nestled in the plants.\" The greenhouse however, is another story altogether. \n\"When we were working in the Menomonee Valley for the show in Three Bridges Park, I noticed that they were building these greenhouses in the park,\" Loewen said. She couldn't resist checking them out. \n\"The greenhouse is just a beautiful space,\" she said. \"It's like a cathedral in there.\" \nAs is her modus operandi, Loewen will take advantage of both the interior and exterior spaces, positioning the audience inside with dancers, as well as looking through the glass to watch dancers outside, and finally, gathering near the reflecting pool. \nThe Wild Space program, titled \"Luminous,\" will use light to extend the inside of the greenhouse outside and bring the space outside the greenhouse inside. \nThat approach requires what Loewen called \"a pretty big cast.\" Some former Wild Space company members, a few recent University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee graduates and some interns will join Wild Space Company members for this program. IF YOU GO \nWhen: 7:30 p.m. Oct. 22-24 \nWhere: Mitchell Park Horticultural Conservatory Annex, 524 S. Layton Blvd. \nTickets: $25 premium (includes 6:45 p.m. preshow talk), $20 general admission, $15 students and seniors.
