The film, starring Hugh Jackman and Garrett Hedlund, had also been pushed back from July to October, and has not been well received by critics. \nPan now ranks among 2015′s biggest flops, including Fantastic Four and Tomorrowland. International earnings don’t look promising either, as the film brought in a weak 20.5 million dollars (£13.3 million), compared to The Martian, which earned 58.1 million dollars (£37.8 million) over the same period. \nPan is released in the UK on October 16. Hugh Jackman and Levi Miller star in Joe Wright’s Pan (Evan Agostini/Invision) \nSony’s high-wire spectacle The Walk also stumbled in its first weekend in wide release, after debuting on Imax screens last week. The tale of Philippe Petit’s tight-rope walk between the towers of the World Trade Centre earned 3.7 million dollars (£2.4 million) this weekend, bringing its total to 6.4 million dollars (£4.1 million). Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars in film directed by Robert Zemeckis. \nNot all was bleak at the box office, though. Ridley Scott’s space adventure The Martian earned a solid 37 million dollars (£24 million) in its second week in cinemas, nabbing the top spot once more. \nHotel Transylvania 2 took second place in its third weekend with 20.3 million dollars (£13.2 million). Pan came in at number three. Share article \nNancy Meyers’ workplace comedy The Intern earned 8.7 million dollars (£5.6 million), and the border thriller Sicario brought in 7.4 million dollars (£4.8 million), rounding out the top five.
