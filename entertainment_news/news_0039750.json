It says in a statement that his admitted behavior was \"inconsistent with the character and high standards\" expected of honorees. \nSeveral other schools, including Fordham, Marquette, Baylor and Pennsylvania's Wilkes University, have already pulled their Cosby degrees. FILE - In this Nov. 6, 2013 file photo, comedian Bill Cosby performs at the Stand Up for Heroes event at Madison Square Garden in New York. \"Dateline NBC\" will bring 29 women who have accused Bill Cosby of assault together for a special on Friday, Oct. 8, 2015. NBC's broadcast was timed to coincide with Cosby's scheduled deposition Friday in the case of a woman who accused Cosby of molesting her at the Playboy Mansion in 1974, when she was 15.
