Share \nThe new Star Wars: The Force Awakens trailer has debuted to very mixed fan feelings. \nBut mostly though, it’s the absence of one person that has fans up in arms: Luke Skywalker (played by Mark Hamill). Check out the new official poster! Tune in to @ESPN ’s Monday Night Football for a new look at #TheForceAwakens . pic.twitter.com/NTRWLlVyID \n— Star Wars (@starwars) October 18, 2015 \nFirst he wasn’t in the new poster that was unveiled, and now not a sign of him in the trailer. \nSo, just WHERE is Luke Skywalker? Mark has said he’s featuring in the movie, so why his complete absence? The Force. It’s calling to you. Tickets on sale now: https://t.co/PwNxYwmCEe #TheForceAwakens https://t.co/UxAgY5MejQ \n— Star Wars (@starwars) October 20, 2015 \nWhere better to look for the answer than from Star Wars fans themselves: \nHe’s gone to the Dark Side. Judging by the new Force Awakens tailer, I think Luke Skywalker has been seduced by the dark side. I think he's the guy in the mask. \n— James Wharton (@jameswharton) October 20, 2015 \nWho’s that guy in the mask on the left of the new poster? Could Luke have become the new Sith Lord? In this theory, Luke Skywalker isn’t missing from the poster at all, he’s just hiding in plain sight as Kylo Ren. Although Adam Driver has been cast in this role, so… \nHe’s gone into self-imposed exile. Okay #StarWars peeps, I think this is Luke Skywalker in exile with R2D2 in the #TheForceAwakens trailer. Thoughts? pic.twitter.com/2vSthRp6cZ \n— Becki Schildhouse (@BeckiSSD) October 20, 2015 \nDesperate to avoid the same mistakes as his father, this theory goes that Luke has removed himself from society (perhaps with R2D2) and it’s up to Finn and Rey (our new heroes in The Force Awakens) to convince him to return to the fight before evil forces find him. \nHe’s guarding an ancient Sith tomb. Rumor has it Luke Skywalker is protecting an old sith tomb. The tomb suposebly holds the resting corp's of Darth plaugeous? Will see \n— Aaron Syke (@7231dfcec929475) April 3, 2015 \nSupposedly bad guy Kylo Ren and his band of troublemakers The Knights of Ren are trying to find Luke’s old lightsaber (lost in Episode V) which was once owned by Darth Vader and potentially opens a Sith tomb housing a new evil. Further fan speculation is that Benicio del Toro could be playing the baddie inside the tomb and Luke’s off playing security guard. \nHe’s been kidnapped. #StarWars plot synopsis: Luke kidnapped. Creates disturbance in force. New random characters feel it. Find han & Leia. Come together. War. \n— Matt Gill 996 (@mattgill996) October 20, 2015 \nOne fan theory is that Luke is being held captive on a planet with a super-weapon that has the power to destroy the whole star system. Luke can’t risk using his Jedi powers to escape as they’ll trigger the weapon so he’s trapped next to a time-bomb. \nHe’s lost. I'm calling it now. The reason you don't see Luke in the poster or the new trailer is because he is missing and they need to find him. \n— Chris Miller (@omniprime) October 20, 2015 Share article \nThis one says that Finn and Rey (John Boyega and Daisy Ridley) discover a severed hand clutching a lightsaber that they recognise as an old Jedi relic. The two join forces with Han Solo and Chewbacca and set off on a quest to find the hand’s owner: the missing Jedi Master and Han’s old friend.
