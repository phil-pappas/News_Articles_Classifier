YouTube The sleazy, tough talking 1950’s detective Mike Hammer pays a visit to the Detroit Film Theatre Saturday. “Kiss Me Deadly” , the best of the Mike Hammer films, will be screened as part of the DFT 101 film series.\nCourtesy of MGM Home Entertainment Pulp fiction meets Cold War paranoia in this classic film noir directed by Robert Aldrich. Instead of pimping out his secretary Velda ( Maxine Cooper ) to catch cheating spouses in the act, Mike Hammer ( Ralph Meeker ) finds himself picking up the hysterical hitchhiker Christina ( Cloris Leachman in her film debut) whom he eventually learns has escaped from a mental institution. She has a secret, and the information dies with her when those who are after her find her. They attempt to kill Hammer as well, but he miraculously survives. He decides to pursue the case, both for vengeance and because \"she [Christina] must be connected with something big\" behind it all. Hammer finds himself investigating Christina’s supposed ex-roommate Lily Carver ( Gaby Rodgers ). She is after a mysterious box, which Velda calls “the great whatsit”, that is worth a fortune. It leads to probably the most explosive climax in film noir history.\nThe film showed the fears of the atomic bomb that Americans felt due to the Cold War. The Kefauver Commission, a federal unit dedicated to investigating corrupting influences in the 1950s, singled this out as the number one menace to American youth in 1955. Because of this, Aldrich was compelled to conduct a writing campaign for the free speech rights of independent film-makers.\n“ Kiss Me Deadly ” plays at the Detroit Film Theatre on Saturday, October 17 at 4 P.M. only. Tickets are $5. Admission is free for members of the Detroit Institute of Arts. Just show your membership card at the door.
