VPC\nMichael Fassbender takes on a tech giant in the drama 'Steve Jobs.' (Photo: Universal Pictures)\n16 CONNECT 47 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE The wait for the definitive onscreen Steve Jobs has been as arduous as the anticipation for the next iPhone.\nNo need to reboot again, because Hollywood has finally found its man. Michael Fassbender embodies the iconic Apple co-founder in more ways than just wearing his trademark black turtleneck, jeans and New Balance sneakers in the striking and innovative Steve Jobs (***½ out of four; rated R; opens Friday in New York and Los Angeles, nationwide Oct. 23).\nUSA TODAY\nAs 'Steve Jobs,' Michael Fassbender may be Oscar-bound\nDirected by Danny Boyle and featuring a cracking good script by Aaron Sorkin, the drama aggressively eschews normal biopic methodology for a curious three-act structure that works for the most part: The movie focuses on Jobs in the moments before three huge launches, while also tracking the tech giant’s rise and fall and rise again. It's fitting, since much of the film explores whether the Jobs that people saw was just another product of a genius mind.\n“Everyone is waiting for the Mac,” Jobs proudly states in 1984 to his marketing chief, Joanna Hoffman (a remarkable Kate Winslet). His unending passion to change not just computers but human lives with personal technology is clear even then, though the minutiae bother him, too. Jobs about has a fit when a demo doesn’t seem to work at first — he gets it right later, of course, because he's Steve Jobs — while fellow co-founder Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen) sulks about something more significant to him: the benching of the Apple II in favor of Jobs' dream machine.\nUSA TODAY\n5 things we learned about 'Steve Jobs' at NYFF\nThe drama isn’t just in the computer arena and taking on Microsoft. Jobs, himself adopted, is confronted with his estranged young daughter (Makenzie Moss), initially denying paternity but taking responsibility by the time 1988 — the setting for the second act — rolls around. He's on stage for a next-generation computer from NeXT, the company Jobs formed after being booted from Apple, but there are still hard feelings with Apple CEO John Sculley (Jeff Daniels), leading to an intensely watchable war of words.\nJobs is back in the fold by 1998 and ready to unveil the colorful iMac, which leads to many confrontations and a satisfying, albeit sudden, finale.\nRogen is steady as Wozniak and makes the most of his dramatic telling off of Jobs: “It's not binary. You can be decent and gifted at the same time.” And Michael Stuhlbarg brings warmth and talent to the supporting role of Andy Hertzfeld, a friend of Jobs’ who stepped up for him when he couldn’t be bothered.\nUSA TODAY\nMichael Fassbender 'studied Ashton Kutcher' to play Steve Jobs\nSorkin's script is clever and knowing — at one point late in the proceedings, Jobs wonders aloud why “everybody gets drunk” and takes him to task five minutes before every event. It's a small moment that breaks the fourth wall in the slightest and smartest of ways.\nFassbender gives his lines measured weight and gravitas in his interpretation of the late enigmatic legend that also exorcises the demons of poor Jobses past (apologies, Noah Wyle and Ashton Kutcher). He’s at times a cruel jerk and moments later a loving soul: Jobs is protective of Wozniak while in the same sentence calling him “Rain Man.” The actor nails all the techno mumbo jumbo, is a force in the scenes where Jobs takes charge, but is probably best when this pop-culture antihero has to be tender around the kid he struggles to know.\nSteve Jobs is a fascinating study of a man, explaining who he was but never making a judgment about who he is. The movie lets audiences compute that for themselves.\n16 CONNECT 47 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 //usat.ly/1RwJwZC TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798383223540102-SJOBSPK001-D033-00138-RV2-CROP.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1RwJwZC", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a9b1844eed1c3c8e17759536dc6a2763497f21eb/c=136-0-1631-1495/local/-/media/2015/10/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798284365753944-XXX-STEVE-JOBS-MOV-DCB-74914270-1-.JPG", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/08/29906170001_4399341098001_video-still-for-video-4399173568001.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/521cd80a4fb9f1f1edf37d025629b379daee5bba/r=500x332/local/-/media/2015/10/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798383223540102-SJOBSPK001-D033-00138-RV2-CROP.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/08/29906170001_4399341094001_thumbnail-for-video-4399173568001.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RwJwZC&text=Review%3A%20%27Steve%20Jobs%27%20marvels%20as%20man%20and%20movie&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b34c7880c12a63273559fba73f6cabb65d16713a/c=225-0-1720-1495/local/-/media/2015/10/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/635795165967812833-XXX-STEVE-JOBS-MOV-DCB-74914270.JPG", "http://usat.ly/1Lkkf41", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/08/29906170001_4399341098001_video-still-for-video-4399173568001.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34f3c12e46e775b6bc7e523d797ba40d553715a7/r=540&c=540x304/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/08/29906170001_4399341098001_video-still-for-video-4399173568001.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e5dba8ac6e033ac4d8ae6500f5c7ddc4714cc731/c=0-0-2000-2000/local/-/media/2015/10/03/USATODAY/USATODAY/635794944448126028-PicMonkey-Collage.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RwJwZC&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/30054f30c54604014f6a0aec930d7701e454b74f/c=0-0-2655-1996&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798383223540102-SJOBSPK001-D033-00138-RV2-CROP.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:18:05.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
