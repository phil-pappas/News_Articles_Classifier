The flick, directed by Taika Waititi and produced by Kevin Feige, is reportedly on the fast-track in pre-production.\nThe deal will mark the Hulk character's latest appearance on the big screen since this year's Avengers: Age of Ultron . Due to rights restrictions -- Universal holds the green character's distribution rights and Marvel authority over the character -- filmmakers have not been able to produce a standalone film for Ruffalo's Hulk.\nActors Tom Hiddleston and Jamie Alexander are set to return to Ragnarok , which JoBlo reports will cover a \"Norse Apocalypse,\" on an entirely different planet than Asgard or Earth, is set for release in November 2017.\n#MarvelMotivationMonday pic.twitter.com/UsVrF84Xv9\nâ€” Marvel Entertainment (@Marvel) October 12, 2015 Elizabeth Olsen talks 'chemistry' with Tom Hiddleston Seth MacFarlane hosts Bernie Sanders rally in Hollywood Jared Leto, Mark Ruffalo don disguises to mingle at New York Comic Con", "external_links": ["http://www.joblo.com/movie-news/exclusive-confirmed-mark-ruffalos-hulk-will-return-in-thor-ragnarok-309", "http://t.co/UsVrF84Xv9", "https://facebook.com/unitedpress", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/mark-ruffalos-hulk-appear-thor-832519", "http://variety.com/2015/film/news/mark-ruffalo-thor-ragnarok-hulk-1201619246/", "https://www.facebook.com/UnitedPress", "https://twitter.com/Marvel/status/653648147080679424", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarvelMotivationMonday?src=hash"], "published": "2015-10-16T17:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:36:31.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
