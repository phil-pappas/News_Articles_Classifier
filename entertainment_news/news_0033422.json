We both plan to get a couple of starts in this series if needed. We're eager to go out and win games.\"\nArrieta has thrown a career high 243 2/3 innings in the regular season and postseason, and he admittedly was out of rhythm Monday when he allowed four runs in 5 2/3 innings to beat the Cardinals in the NL Division Series.\nBut Arrieta said he felt fine during a 35-pitch bullpen session before Thursday's workout in which he worked on several \"fastball-changeup\" combinations.\nLester would have pitched the fifth and deciding game of the NLDS at St. Louis if the Cubs had not wrapped up the series Tuesday. Manager Joe Maddon said it lined up well for Lester to open the NLCS and for Arrieta to get an extra day of rest.\n\"We've been pushing him very hard,\" Maddon said. \"His innings are way up compared to where they have been in the past (156 2/3 in 2014).\"\nMaddon said it was unlikely he would start Lester or Arrieta on short rest in the NLCS, adding he probably would use four starters in the series.\nThe Cubs prepare for the National League Championship Series.\n\"Jon Lester in a big game is always tasty,\" Maddon said.\nRecovery time: From Maddon, who is nursing a cold, to the players, the three-day break between series was welcomed.\n“I have so few brain cells left I have to protect them,” quipped Maddon, who didn’t attend a gathering for the American League Division Series with his players Wednesday night.\nThe players celebrated Tuesday's NLDS victory later that night at Lester's home, where musician Eddie Vedder performed.\n\"It's good for us to decompress and reserve some of the adrenaline and energy for the days ahead,\" Arrieta said. \"Where we're at now, this team hasn't been here for a long time. We know how to approach it right.\"\nMovie time: A fan gave Arrieta a replica Marty McFly cap from the 1989 movie \"Back to the Future\" that predicted the Cubs would win the 2015 World Series. That prompted Arrieta to watch the movie for the first time.\nPrivacy Policy Major League Baseball Jake Arrieta Jon Lester Joe Maddon Chicago Cubs National League Championship Series St. Louis Cardinals", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562043d9/turbine/ct-lester-arrieta-bits-cubs-nlcs-spt-1016-20151015", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56202775/turbine/ct-cubs-practice-at-wrigley-field-photos-spt-20151015"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:59:42.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
