There is no doubt about it,” Waugh said.”Because you didn’t have Warner, Hazlewood and Johnson (in the Bangladesh squad), so there’s three players straight away you’d imagine would come back into the reckoning for the first Test. \n“There’s going to be some guys picked for that tour who are probably going to get shuffled back down the order a little bit, but you can’t do anything about it.”The camp will involve centre wicket and net practice across both days, Cricket Australia said.The first Test against the Black Caps is at Brisbane’s Gabba from November 5. \nAustralia – Steve Smith, David Warner, Cameron Bancroft, Joe Burns, Nathan Coulter-Nile, James Faulkner, Andrew Fekete, Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Johnson, Usman Khawaja, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Shaun Marsh, Glenn Maxwell, Peter Nevill, Steve O’Keefe, Peter Siddle, Mitchell Starc, Adam Voges. \n  11:12 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:36:52.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
