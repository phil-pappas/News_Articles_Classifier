Alan and Sally Fernald Art Gallery of the University of Maine's Hutchinson Center, 80 Belmont Ave./Route 3. The public is invited to an opening reception Friday, Oct. 16, from 5:30 to 8 p.m. The show will continue through Jan. 15. \nIn the exhibition, architects, painters, letter cutters, calligraphers, sculptors, illustrators and political commentators in Maine come together to share their thoughts and their aesthetic. Included are the works of Olena Babak, Alan Bray, Douglas Coffin, Sigrid Coffin, Susan Cooney, Lois Dodd, Jay Gibson, Susan Groce, Larason Guthrie, Eric Hopkins, America Martin, Natasha Mayers, Jan Owen, Anthony Shostak, John Silverio and John Whalley. \nAll people, across time and around the globe, have drawn, for as far back in time as human history is known. Drawing is a visual language that tells stories of our lives, activities, dreams and beliefs. Children from around the world draw without direction or instruction. No other animal on the planet explains its existence through image making the way humans do. This impulse is explored and celebrated in “Drawn.” \nThe gallery is open weekdays from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. For more information or to request a disability accommodation, contact Nancy Bergerson at 338-8049.
