Woman strolling on Seaside Heights beach found the ancient artifact on October 6. She now keeps it in her purse. Commons Wikimedia A Seaside Heights artifact was discovered on a New Jersey beach and may hold clues to prehistoric America. The 10,000-year-old spearhead was found by a woman who was walking along Seaside Heights beach on October 6 with her sister. They were looking for sea glass after a big storm that had rolled through, but stumbled across what appeared to be a very interesting piece of history.\nCurators with the New Jersey State Museum examined the projectile point and determined that the Seaside Heights artifact found is from a time when prehistoric life in America was alive and well, dbTechno reports October 16. Dr. Gregory Lattanzi, an expert in studying artifacts such as these, told ABC News : \"It’s a pretty rare find. There are actually professional excavations to try and find points like these, so to be along the shore and see it washed up is pretty incredible.\"\nLattanzi said that the flint is between 10,00 to 11,000-years-old; he said that it's one of the older artifacts he’s seen from the Paleo-Indian period. He surmises that the spearheaded relic was probably used by semi-nomadic natives who constantly sharpened the stone to hunt animals, such as deer and ancient caribou. The artifact is also important because \"we now have another piece of evidence from prehistoric habitation sites from land previously exposed but now covered in water.\" He adds that this will \"help us get a better idea of just how far these sites may be located out in the ocean.\"\nThe woman who found the Seaside Heights artifact -- Audrey Stanick -- actually has it. She said that she keeps it in her purse and is amazed by the incredibly rare find.", "external_links": ["http://abcnews.go.com/US/beachgoer-discovers-10000-year-spearhead-hold-clues-prehistoric/story?id=34526366", "http://www.dbtechno.com/science/2015/10/16/seaside-heights-artifact/"], "published": "2015-10-17T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:29:15.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
