Family ‘Squabbles’ take Tulare Encore spotlight \nWe thank you for the continued support, and now get ready, get set, eat. \nAs always, there will be a fine representation of restaurant vendors and auction items present. Tickets are $50 each, and includes all beverages. \nTickets sell out fast, so don’t wait or you’ll miss out on this highly anticipated annual food-tasting extravaganza. \nTickets can be purchased from a Tulare City Historical Society Board Member, or by calling the museum at 559-686-2074. \nArt exhibit \nThe next exhibit in the Heritage Art Gallery is photography by Jeri Burzin and Beckie Nava called “Two Views: California Gold” beginning on Oct. 15 with a reception to view the artwork and meet the artists from 5- 7 p.m. The reception is free to the public. The photography exhibit will be on display through Saturday, Nov. 14, 2015. \nFrom the artists: “This exhibit is dedicated to Huell Howser and his love of California Gold. For over twenty years, Huell brought us images of the beautiful California landscape that never ceased to amaze us. From small towns off the beaten path, to Sequoia and Kings Canyon Parks in our backyard, to the well-known sights of Yosemite and much more. We too appreciate California’s Gold and try to capture it whenever and wherever we can with our cameras. Whether it is beautiful springtime wildflowers, colorful and delicious vegetables that grow in the Central Valley, the incredible California coast, or our wonderful parks and bridges, we hope you enjoy our views of this majestic state.” 'Treasure Island' sets sail at Enchanted Playhouse \nBurzin is no stranger to the Tulare Historical Museum. She has shown here numerous times. She is both a photographer and mixed media artist whose desire to show how the commonplace may become the unusual continues to be a motivating force. \n“I enjoy the challenge of finding beauty to photograph in my ‘backyard’ as well as in my travels,” Burzin said. \nGolden Fireworks by Beckie Nava (Photo: Submitted) \nNava is new to the Museum family. Her work is very impressive. She has taken many family trips to beautiful locations in the Central Coast, Lake Tahoe, Colorado and Hawaii to photograph glorious sunsets and sunrises and views of nature’s endless possibilities. \nOne stormy day, driving up Highway 101, she stopped by the roadside to take a random sunset picture. Opening her photo browser, the image of “Hand of God” reached out and grabbed her and said, “This is the one to share with the world.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T09:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:13:54.342+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
