Sanders will appear on DeGeneres' show on Oct. 15 , in what the show says will be his first talk show appearance following the debate in Las Vegas on Oct. 13 . Hillary Clinton\n, so far his chief rival for the Democratic nomination, appeared on the show last month. On Oct. 14 , Sanders will appear at a fundraiser at the Beverly Hills home of Syd and Linda Leibovitch\n, with the rock group America performing at the event. Tickets start at $500 per person, with donors paying the maximum $2,700 per person also invited to a pre-event reception. According to the invite, hosts so far include Cindy Asner\n, Benjamin W. Decker\n, Sherry and Leo Frumkin\n, Frances Fisher\n, Peter Fitzer\n, Judith Leland\n, Chris Kantrowitz\n, Mimi Kennedy\n, Nancy Koppelman\n, Jamie McGurk\n, Jerry and Jan Manpearl\n, Mark Rassi\nand Marianne Williamson\n. A campaign spokeswoman said no rally is planned for this visit. In August, Sanders held a rally at Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena that drew an estimated 27,000 people.\nSanders' campaign announced last week that it raised $26 million in the third quarter, just $2 million shy of the $28 million raised by Clinton's campaign.\n ", "external_links": ["http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=7&c2=6035310&c3=10000&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T20:28:49.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
