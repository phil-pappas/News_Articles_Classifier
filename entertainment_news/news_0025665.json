Scott does generate a degree of suspense in this climactic stretch, but the film's overall tone is dominated by the characters' collegial humor, mutual respect among professionals and smart people being tested by an unprecedented challenge. The director and screenwriter downplay the conventional melodrama inherent in the situation in favor of emphasizing how practical problems should be addressed with rational responses rather than hysteria, knee-jerk patriotism or selfish expedience. 22 photos: Awards-season possibilities 22 photos: Awards-season possibilities Come Labor Day, Hollywood starts switching its attention from big-budget blockbusters to slightly smaller-budget films, many of which depend more on scripts and acting than CGI.

The film also stars Alec Baldwin and Albert Brooks; Owen Wilson plays NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. It opens December 25. Hide Caption 22 of 22 The result is an uncustomarily cheery and upbeat film from Scott, a number of whose works range from the despairing (\"Thelma and Louise,\" \"Black Hawk Down\") to the nihilistic (\"Hannibal,\" \"The Counselor\"). There is also a insinuation that the meticulous sense of resourcefulness, the upbeat get-the-job-done attitude exemplified by Mark is very much akin to the director's own, to the point that the optimistic lining common to both the novel and the film seems at one with the story itself and not an artificial, Hollywood-induced spin. In significant measure due to his character's mordant humor, which Goddard has slightly amplified from the book, Damon provides comfortable company during the long stretches when he's onscreen alone, and the actor's physicality makes Mark's capability entirely credible. The scenes back on Earth provide a hectic, densely populated counterweight to the Martian aridity, which is magnificently represented by exteriors shot in the vicinity of Wadi Rum in Jordan, not far from where great stretches of \"Lawrence of Arabia\" were filmed. Cinematographer Dariusz Wolski turns the neat trick of providing the film with a fundamental documentary reality while also making a thing of great beauty. Extra attentiveness is amply on display in all creative departments. ©2015 The Hollywood Reporter.
