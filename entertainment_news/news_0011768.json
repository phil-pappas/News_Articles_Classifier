This feel-good movie, which has attracted Oscar buzz, shouldn't get any awards for casting.\" \nThe Martian, which stars Matt Damon as a stranded astronaut fighting for survival on Mars, has proved a big hit since its release earlier this month, topping the box office on both sides of the Atlantic.
