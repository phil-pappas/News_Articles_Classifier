But anyone who is famous has probably wanted to be famous. It doesn't happen accidentally. \n''So when you find out that it's not as pretty as it looks, I feel like that's almost your comeuppance or your karma. It's the universe saying: 'You wanted it so badly, and here it is. Not what you thought it would be, right?''' \nMeanwhile, the 28-year-old star is looking forward to releasing her new album 'Delirium' but admits it is a bit of an ''experiment''. \nShe said: '''A part of me views this album as an experiment - to make a big pop album. I made a conscious decision that I wanted it to be on another level.'' \nAnd Ellie says her favourite song of hers changes from day to day. \nWhen asked which of her own tracks she likes best, she said: ''Oh, I couldn't tell you that. It varies. Sometimes a particularly song will go down very well in a set and that then is my favourite, or I will hear one on the radio after not hearing it for a while and that'll be my favourite. They're all special for different reasons.'' Contactmusic", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:03:32.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
