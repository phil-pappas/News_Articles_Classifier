From some of his friends and collaborators as well as a few younger songwriters, Albert requested albums for review, picked songs that caught his ear, made the final cut, then secured permissions for his choices. \nHe drew on long-ago advice from Michael Brewer (of Brewer & Shipley) about how to create a flow for an album. Local producer Gary Smith remastered the material to achieve a uniformity of sound among songs recorded in many different ways. \nThe result is “Missouri Homegrown: Variations on a Theme,” of which Albert’s Hideaway Records has manufactured a small batch of discs. Lofredo, who has distributed the seven albums Albert has produced, is remastering the songs for iTunes streaming service, Albert said. \nLofredo said Albert’s project grabbed his attention for more reasons than just their long friendship. \n“The quality of the producer and the quality of the material make these projects work,” Lofredo said. “Chris has an attitude of follow up and follow through.” \nThe album release is planned for sometime before the end of the year, Lofredo said. \nAlbert is nothing if not enthusiastic: \n• “Givin’ My Rhythm the Blues,” Howie and the Hillcats: “Best rockabilly tune I ever heard, and to me, that personifies the Ozarks rockabilly sound — Mark (Denney) and those guys. That song described all the different flavors of the music.” \n• “The House at the End of the Road,” Emily Higgins: “The purity of folk.” \n• “What’s New,” Kristi Merideth: Albert asked local saxophonist and arranger Brent Vaughan to write parts. “I had recorded her already with a small combo, but we came back later. What if we put some horns on it and make it like a Nelson Riddle-type deal? We fattened it up into this great big sound.” \n• “Mississippi,” Eric Weiler: A song about the death of enigmatic singer-songwriter Jeff Buckley. “Our hometown Tom Waits,” Albert said of Weiler. Reacting to the song, Albert roared out a Tony the Tiger-style “Grrrreat!” \n• “Sunshine Rocker,” Clarentz Brewer: “Clarentz is an old friend of mine, so I went to him, and I heard this song, and I said, ‘god, I love it. It’s so raw. It was this great raw sound. And Lloyd Hicks is playing drums on it. And I said, ‘Oh, I’ve got to use this.’ ” \nThe listening people of the Ozarks are well aware of the vast variety of music that rings out from the region, and this project aims to echo that idea to a wider audience. \nEd Peaco writes about locally grown Ozarks music for the News-Leader.
