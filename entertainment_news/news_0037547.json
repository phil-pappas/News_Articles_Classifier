Virgin introduced the service in July for free trial period on 10 of its planes.\nIn addition, JetBlue announced its partnership with Amazon to bring on-demand entertainment, dubbed Amazon Video, which will allow Amazon Prime members to stream TV shows and movies inflight as part of their paid membership.\nCraig McCarthy may be reached at CMcCarthy@njadvancemedia.com .
