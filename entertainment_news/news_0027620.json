Noah devoted a segment of The Daily Show to address the #BoycottStarWarsEpisodeVII movement, and what it means for complaints about diversity in pop culture, particularly science fiction. The host pointed out that the movement, which picked up steam on social media when the new trailer was released, has accused the film for having a \"sinister multicultural agenda\" by having a main cast that is not full of white males and starring John Boyega as a black stormtrooper. \"How would the Jedi council allow a sinister multicultural agenda?\" he asked, pointing to a photo of the council, comprised of aliens and the clearly not-white Samuel L. Jackson. He then threw to Jordan Klepper , Senior Fantasy Culture Correspondent, to talk about diversity in science fiction.
