The slow-bob dance in sweatpants exposed Drake's disdain for arranged choreography, but it reminded us of the Internet's passion to have fun at a celebrity's expense. \nFirst up: Drake making fun of himself. @ChampagnePapi re-grammed his dance moves synced to some Latin flavor. \nComplex is doing the same thing, highlighting Drake's bachata boogie. \nAnd Mashable is dubbing a few moves of their own, including \"bar mitzvah dad\" , \"invisible saxophone\" and the \"respectfully disagree.\" \nSo yes, this, and this, may all look like how you dance when you're home alone in your underwear, but perhaps it was all a distraction because Drake started some D.R.A.M. ... a. \nD.R.A.M., the artist behind the song \"Cha Cha,\" unleashed a slew of tweets after Drake's \"Hotline Bling\" was compared to his, a song that D.R.A.M. quietly released last fall. D.R.A.M. tweeted that it was \"bittersweet\" and he's \"good\" but does feel his record was \"jacked.\" \nErykah Badu , who covered \"Hotline Bling,\" tweeted back, saying: \"We loved Cha Cha first . Very unique and raw. That's that underground magic force that sparks a seed to grow a tree.\" \nI'm no botanist, but sounds like D.R.A.M. doesn't think that seed was theirs to plant. Still, no comment from Drake on the matter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:23:33.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
