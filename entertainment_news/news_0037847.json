The Hollywood favorites recently spent their time together to make a very short film in which Pratt and Ansari star. Ansari posted the short film on Instagram and captioned it, \"CHRIS PRATT AND AZIZ ANSARI present... 'hi guys'.\" He also mentioned that the movie was directed by Lawrence with Schumer involved as director of photography. All of them were mentioned as screenwriters. Schumer's sister Kim Caramele was also present and credited as writer. The video shows Pratt standing behind Ansari, who is swinging on a swing and repeatedly saying \"hi guys\" as he waves his hand in front of the camera. Pratt looks annoyed with Ansari, but he keeps his face straight.
