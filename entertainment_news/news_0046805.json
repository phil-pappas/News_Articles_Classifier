When the festival began 16 years ago, only 80 groups wanted in. \n“We’ve always been viewed as the sort of drunken uncle of theatre,” said the festival’s founder and improv instructor Alistair Cook. “Everyone likes us at parties but doesn’t want to say we are legitimate theatre, but as of late it has been considered more legitimate. \n“We have an explosive growth as of late, the amount of performers that come from improv background and are being cast in TV and film has created an explosive growth in the improv school system,” said Cook. \nA great example of that is the recently Emmy-nominated Tatiana Maslany from Orphan Black. The Regina native was a VIIF participant for three years. Maslany took part in the International Ensemble portion of the festival. This is where solo improvisers from around the world are brought together in large groups and learn and perform together under the tutelage of top-notch improv directors. This year three ensemble groups will be formed. \nAlso in the lineup are groups from all around North America. Included on the talent roster are Chicago’s Pitsil & Stamen, Atlanta’s Dark Side of the Room, Vancouver’s The Sunday Service and Toronto’s Kevin. \n“It was an ensemble festival when we started,” said Cook. “Basically we took improvisers from Europe and North America and put them together in a group of 20 and the whole week was different types of performance from that same group.” \nCook likens the ensemble experience to another often free-form art form. \n“It’s parallel to jazz musicians,” said Cook, who heads up Instant Theatre, the improv company that is producing VIIF. “You can put together fabulous jazz musicians to play brand new songs and within about four or five hours of them jamming, they will come up with great things, and that’s what improv really lends itself to.” \nImprov, according to Cook, also lends itself to a world off the stage. Cook, who travels far and wide to teach the art of improv to actors as well as accountants, believes improv can be a real emotional door opener. \n“It’s really about allowing yourself to say yes to things, because you are going to experience more in life and be open to more in life if you say yes,” said Cook. “If you can identify that you are stopping yourself before you even get started.” \nSo maybe get started by checking out the festival. \ndgee@theprovince.com \ntwitter.com/dana_gee \nWHAT: Vancouver International Improv Festival \nWHEN: Oct. 6-10", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T23:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T13:35:29.294+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
