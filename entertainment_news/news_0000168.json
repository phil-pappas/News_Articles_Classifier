Their new Band of the Month program, introduced in July, helps to promote local bands on Cascio's website and in their retail store.\nNew Berlin, WI (PRWEB) September 30, 2015\n\"Born in Wisconsin in 1946\" is a new slogan for Milwaukee's popular and enduring Cascio Interstate Music SuperStore , and for 69 years this music store has been an integral part of the city's musical landscape. Besides being a source for musicians to buy and rent musical instruments, Cascio also strongly believes in the value of live music that takes place in their own backyard, providing publicity and concert promotion for events at local theaters and venues.\nCascio Interstate interacts directly with these Milwaukee-area venues, helping to publicize the theater's or venue's messaging along with specific information on concerts and productions. The Company helps spread the word on the artist and venues in order to help both the artist and venue through this additional exposure, and ultimately ticket sales.\nCascio's marketing department creates and utilizes e-media, print, social media and in-store support to present a multi-channeled approach, which directly targets their musical customers and other music fans. Company CEO/CMO Michael Houser states, “We feel as though it is our responsibility to help artists receive as large of a 'reach' as possible by exposing their music to as many fans as possible. Since our customer base is primarily all musicians, it is a small way we can help artists receive as broad of a base of fans as we can expose their music to in our market, whether they are established artists or newcomers.”\nCascio Interstate Music supports or has supported complete show series or select events at the following venues:\nSharon Lynne Wilson Center for the Arts in suburban Brookfield Stefanie H. Weill Center for the Performing Arts in Sheboygan Summerfest, “The World's Largest Music Festival” in Milwaukee South Milwaukee Performing Arts Center in South Milwaukee BMO Harris Bradley Center in Milwaukee The Pabst Theater in Milwaukee The Riverside Theater in Milwaukee Turner Hall Ballroom in Milwaukee\nA new program has been designed to feature Milwaukee's home-grown musical talent with Cascio Interstate's Band of the Month, at http://www.interstatemusic.com/bandofthemonth.aspx . Selected bands are promoted online in Cascio's social media accounts and newsletter, and inside the retail store with the opportunity to sell their latest release. The Band of the Month also receives a free $100 gift card to use at Cascio Interstate. In exchange for this, the bands are asked to post about Cascio on social media, and to add the Cascio logo into the corner of an upcoming show flyer.\nAbout Cascio Interstate Music:\nCascio Interstate Music ranks in the top 15 nationally among musical instrument retailers and is one of the nation's top drum retailers.
