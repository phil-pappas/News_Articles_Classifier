Gambone Posted Oct. 16, 2015 at 4:13 PM » Social News There are many troubles in life that can drive one to their knees, but High Desert-based author M.A. Speight says being betrayed is among the worst. Speight is well acquainted with what the feeling is like and admits that to this day she still struggles to find healing after being cast aside many years ago by those she trusted the most. In an effort to emotionally recover from her past wounds of betrayal, as well as a miscarriage, the Antelope Valley native penned a book about her healing journey titled, “3 AM Conversations with God.” Speight said it primarily talks about the disappointments we face in life and how to not only cope with them but emerge victoriously. “During some of the most difficult times of my life, God would call me awake at 3 a.m. and I would go sit in this old recliner and pray, cry, mediate or do whatever it took to bring myself comfort,” said Speight, 47. “I found a lot of clarity doing that and ultimately learned that I am never alone and that things are never as dark as they seem.” Speight, a devout Christian, said it took her four years to write “3 AM Conversations with God.” She admits she had a lot of obstacles to overcome, including having the thumb drive with her original manuscript on it stolen. Somehow, she found the motivation to rewrite her book and finally had it published by Tate Publishing last July. Since then, Speight has been conducting a grass roots marketing campaign, which includes setting up book signings around the Southland. She hopes her story will encourage anyone going through trials and tribulations that they feel are insurmountable. “I meet a lot of people who struggle with disappointments and betrayal,” said Speight. “Most have some sort of faith and I tell them that the most positive way to cope with problems is with prayer. And my book talks a lot about that and also includes many encouraging Bible verses. “I know that there were plenty of times I prayed for the peace that passes all understanding and it would wash over me. And then I’d feel safe to make a decision without doubting or second-guessing myself. That’s what happens when you get out of your own way and allow God to heal you.” Speight also says in her book that those who believe in God must trust that while sadness may come for a night, there is always joy waiting for them in the morning. “When something ends or someone betrays us, these are disappointments and they aren’t meant for us to hold on to them for dear life,” said Speight, a licensed marriage and family therapist who holds a master’s degree in psychology from Chapman University. “They are experiences that teach us how to let go and move on.” As Speight continues to grow in her faith and gain more strength through her beliefs, she said she has moved on to a wonderful life. Along with writing books, she also operates a private marriage and family counseling business and is a clinical supervisor at Victorville Community Support Services. On the personal front, Speight said she is dating the man of her dreams and also has been blessed with the gift of a wonderful little black pug she calls Leroy Jackson Brown. “Leroy has been my rock,” said Speight. “I just look at him and when I see all that unconditional love in his eyes, I know everything is right with the world.” To purchase “3 AM Conversations with God\" ($8.99), visit www.amazon.com .
