The Cubs, and the team that's playing the Cardinals.\"\nWith her two favorites being one and the same right now, she wears the sweatshirt proudly – despite the fact her husband, Clarence Robinson, is sitting about six feet away in his favorite chair, wearing a vintage Cardinals T-shirt surrounded by a Cardinals jersey.\nThey're used to it. It's been this way for a long time, even longer than the 58 years the near West Side Aurora couple has been married.\n\"I've always been a Cub fan,\" says Shirley. \"My Dad was a Cub fan. I've been a Cub fan through thick and thin.\"\nMostly thin, as Clarence, a long-time Cardinals fan, is quick to remind her. Having lived in Aurora since 1959, he has put up with being in the minority as a St. Louis fan – albeit a more successful minority, at least as far as championships go.\n\"I've been getting the business all week,\" he says. \"I'll take the heat. But this time next week, we'll see who's talking. I always tell the Cub fans, yeah, I get so sick of buying World Series tickets – I have to do it all the time.\"\nAurora couple, and rivals Steve Lord, The Beacon-News Shirley and Clarence Robinson even declare their baseball allegiance outside their West Aurora home, with rival signs and even birdhouses. Shirley and Clarence Robinson even declare their baseball allegiance outside their West Aurora home, with rival signs and even birdhouses. (Steve Lord, The Beacon-News) Normally, them's fightin' words to Cubs fans, but Shirley and Clarence have been able to go back and forth like that most of their lives – and even involve the extended family – without too much incident.\n\"You gotta give and take a bit,\" Clarence says with a smile. \"Neither one of us has had to sleep in the garage yet.\"\nWell, OK, almost without incident.\nThere was the time Clarence was in the Wrigley Field bathroom wearing his Cardinals hat, when he noticed it was gone.\nHe rarely goes to Wrigley any more, and never wears a hat.\nAnd there was the time after the 1969 season that Shirley took a bit too much ribbing from Clarence's aunt and uncle, also Cardinals fans.\n\"I didn't speak to them for a long time after that,\" she says.\nClarence is used to being in a minority within his own family, too, where only son Mark Robinson, an Aurora firefighter, took up Cardinal fandom. It's not unusual for father and son to get up early, drive to St. Louis to see a game, and drive back the same day.\nCaption Cubs-Cards rivalry front and center in St. Louis The start of Game 1 of the NLDS.

(WGN-TV) \"Over the years, as soon as a baby was born, she ran out and got them a Cubbie outfit,\" Clarence says. \"I ended up with one Cardinal fan – the rest of them are the enemy.\"\nThe couple's love affair with their respective teams goes back further than their marriage. They grew up in downstate Kewanee, where declaring your Cubs or Cardinals fandom is a rite of passage that goes deeper than declaring a political party.\n\"There were two guys: Ernie Banks or Stan Musial,\" Clarence says. \"You picked one. That's how you decided if you were Cub fan or a Cardinal fan. I picked Stan the Man.\"\nMusial remains Clarence's favorite all-time Card, although he has made room for Hall-of-Fame pitcher Bob Gibson in there, too.\nShirley doesn't hesitate to say Banks is still her favorite all-time Cub – although she can make room for Billy Williams and Ron Santo, too.\nWhile both grew up in Kewanee and knew each other, Shirley and Clarence were not good friends, even throughout high school. It wasn't until Clarence got out of U.S. military service in 1956 that they started dating – and were married in 1957.\nAnd, yes, they knew about each other's rooting interests even then.\n\"When you're dating, you can overlook a lot of things,\" Clarence says with a chuckle.\nThe two moved to Aurora in 1959, where Shirley took a job with Caterpillar, and Clarence worked for Fox Valley Drywall. Shirley eventually started working for a Northwestern Mutual insurance agent where she still works. Clarence does code enforcement work for Aurora Township.\nAs far as enduring each other as they watch the first time the two teams have met in a playoff series, they said they will be fine … maybe.\n\"We're going to try to be civil,\" Shirley says. \"Our son said, you two behave, I'm not going to be around to intervene.\"\nslord@tribpub.com\nCopyright © 2015, Aurora Beacon-News St. Louis Cardinals Chicago Cubs Ron Santo Wrigley Field Billy Williams", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56185102/turbine/ct-abn-cub-cards-couple-st-1011-20151009", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56183da5/turbine/cbs_chicag-cubs-cards-rivalry-front-20151009", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561860bc/turbine/ct-check-out-this-new-cubs-song-video-20151009", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56185103/turbine/ct-ctl-ct-abn-cub-cards-couple-st-1011-jpg-20151009"], "published": "2015-10-10T02:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:18:18.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
