Not only was Pan easily outpaced by last week's top grosser, it was also beaten by a more direct comeptitor, an animated family film in its third week of release. \nNo one expected Pan to do well, but its $15 million dollar take for the weekend was well below even the pessimistic predictions. The Peter Pan prequel starring Hugh Jackman cost about $150 million to make, and Warner Bros. is almost certainly going to lose a bundle before the film's sure-to-be-lackluster run is over. \nThe week's top film was once again The Martian , which took in $37 million in its second weekend. Second place went to Hotel Transylvania 2 , which earned $20.3 million over the weekend. The Walk , which had a disappointing limited release last week, underperformed in wide release this week, taking in just $3.7 million and falling into seventh place for the week. \nDanny Boyle's biopic Steve Jobs did well in limited release this week, but the talky film, which was written by the verbose Aaron Sorkin, will go into wide release next week among a crowded field and may struggle to find a broad audience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T22:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:39:48.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
