The playback singer has since lent her voice to songs like Tera Rasta Chhodo Na (Chennai Express) and Zara Dil Ko Thaam Lo (Don 2).\nAnd now, Anusha has been winning new fans with her rendition of Gulaabo from the Alia-Shahid starrer Shaandar.\nAnusha’s family was always musically-inclined and she grew up learning Carnatic music. She is now married to another musician — Sangeet Haldipur. In a chat with us, Anusha discussed all things musical:\nThe music on repeat on my iPod these days: Wadali Brothers and A.R. Rahman\nIf I had to put together a soundtrack for my life, the five songs on it would be: Who Says by John Mayer, Mangalyam from Saathiya by A.R. Rahman, Kuch Toh Log Kahenge by Kishore Kumar, Dhoka from Johnny Gaddaar and Gulaabo from Shaandaar\nWhat I listen to when:\nI’m happy and upbeat — Phir Se Ud Chala from Rockstar\nI’m really low — Kuch Toh Log Kahenge\nI’m working out — Prodigy and this album by Ram Sampath called Let’s Talk\nI’d describe my taste in music as: Varied. I love listening to all kinds of music, except heavy metal. Every genre has a story to tell and a different effect and impact on the heart.\nMy favourite time/way to listen to music during the day is: Late in the night when it’s dead silent. And the best way to listen to it is on a good sounding speaker — fairly loud!\nIf I could have one band in the world/a musician perform a private concert for me, it would have to be: Shafqat Amanat Ali or Javed Bashir or Farida Khannum ji — I could listen to them for hours!\nAnd the one live act I would love to see at least once in my life: John Mayer or Beyoncé.\n — As told to Aarti Bhanushali\n entertainment Music Anusha Mani Also Read Brad Pitt punched in face at movie premiere: police Shekhar Ravjiani dedicates new single to grandmother Why Raveena rejected Dil Dhadakne Do These are crazy allegations: Daniel Weber", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/20ANUSHA_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/20ANUSHA_0.jpg", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151019/entertainment-tvmusic/article/melody-matters", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-21T01:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T15:20:38.466+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
