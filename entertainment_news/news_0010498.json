Anthony has severe autism, and has spent years in a day program for young people who have intellectual developmental disabilities. But when his birthday rolls around this year, he'll age out of that program and have no place else to go, his family said.\nSo Sherry and Michael Battisti of Ogden decided to take matters — and hammers and nails — into their own hands.\nMichael Battisti, a home builder locally for the past 40 years, is building a group home for his son and five others with intellectual developmental disabilities at 925 Hinchey Road in Gates.\nThe home will have enough room for six residents, and the Battistis said they are hoping Lifetime Assistance will provide the programming for the new home.\n“The town of Gates has agreed to allow the group home to go there, and now we’re waiting for plans to be drawn up for permit purposes,” said Michael Battisti.\nThe Battistis said they decided to build the home after becoming increasingly frustrated trying to find options for Anthony.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nFor those with autism, struggle to find shelter\n“New York state has cut back on funding for group homes and services, and it’s really put the burden on parents to do it.”\nMichael Battisti “It was very frustrating, New York state has cut back on funding for group homes and services, and it’s really put the burden on parents to do it, to get homes built and services provided,” Michael Battisti said. “It’s been difficult for me and I’m in the building industry — I can just imagine how frustrating it would be for other parents who have no idea about the construction and building industry.”\nThe closure of subpar state institutions in the past couple of decades — in an effort to raise the quality of life for people with developmental disabilities — has created a vacuum of services for a specific group of people with the most intense needs.\nIn response to the closings, the strategy of the Office for People With Developmental Disabilities has been to reassess the needs of the people it assists and match them with one of the 6,500 residential programs it oversees through a network of 700 nonprofit agencies.\nBuy Photo Mike Battisti rubs his son Anthony's back in the kitchen of their Ogden home last month.

(Photo: LAUREN PETRACCA/@laurenpetracca/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER)\nIn the 17-county region that makes up the western portion of the OPWDD, earlier this year, there were about 1,000 individuals still waiting for residential support; nearly 300 had requested placement immediately. They are families who are considered \"in urgent need\" of placement for their loved ones with autism, Down syndrome and other categories of intellectual developmental disability, said Pat Muir, chair of Family Advocates United.\nMuir, an advocate for families of children with autism, said a lack of options for the most severely autistic is a growing concern — and many families wait years for placement. Family Advocates United is a collaborative group of organizations that includes AutismUp and Managing Autism Together Today, whose mission is to advocate for appropriate funding for residential services for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities.\n“Right now, services are only going to families in the most serious need — those who have been deemed to be in crisis,” Muir said.\n“OPWDD is in the process of now trying to gather the data of how many people need resources. It's been difficult for them to gather it because they’ve never done it before,” Muir said.\nA survey letter sent in July to families who have registered with OPWDD asks numerous questions about conditions in the home, the level of assistance and the urgency of need.\n“But the resources still aren’t there,” Muir said.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nWhen a brother or sister has autism\nThe Battistis said they learned the hard way how few options they had, but anticipate their son will do well in the new 24-hour care setting.\n\"He does so well at school with his schedule, he enjoys the scheduling part,\" Sherry Battisti said. \"That’s how they run the homes, so I don’t think it will be hard for him to fit into that home setting. He likes going places and they will do outings on the weekends. I think it will be a really good thing for him to be around people his own age and do things together. I think he’ll adjust really well within the first month or two.\"\n“He had language when he was younger and he kept losing it and now he is nonverbal.”\nSherry Battisti As Anthony has grown older — and bigger and stronger — it's become more difficult for his parents to adequately meet their son's needs, said Sherry Battisti.\nAnthony was diagnosed early on in life with a regressive autism, his mother said.\n\"He had language when he was younger and he kept losing it and now he is nonverbal,” she said. “He does understand everything, but he just can’t get the words out to express himself.\"\nAnthony also has epilepsy, and small seizures when he was young became grand mal seizures as he passed through puberty.\n“I’d say taking care of him is sort of like taking care of a 4-year-old,\" Sherry Battisti said. \" He runs around a lot, he likes playing in the pool. He understands what you are saying, but his impulse control is not very good.\n“He can’t focus a lot and just sit down.”\nTheir decision to find Anthony a home was in part made for him, but also for the rest of the family.\n“It is a really hard decision to make,\" Sherry Battisti said. \"We have four older daughters and three grandkids, so one of the things I didn’t want to do was leave that decision to my daughters some day. And as we get older, it gets harder and harder to take care of him.\n“But yeah, it’s going to be a really hard thing to do.”\nMichael Battisti said he is grateful that he can use his livelihood to help his growing son.\n“It does make me feel good that I’m able to help not only my son but other young adults who are in the same predicament,” he said.\nThe Battistis acquired the land on Hinchey Road in early July thanks to a donation from a family member.\nBuy Photo This plot of land on Hinchey Road in Gates is where the Battistis plan to build a house for young adults with autism. (Photo: LAUREN PETRACCA/@laurenpetracca/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER)\nIt will be a six-bedroom ranch house, roughly 3,500 square feet with an office and walk-in pantry, laundry room and other features. Construction is scheduled to begin later this year or in January.\n“There is an empty lot next to it that we are looking at for the future. It’s an older neighborhood, and there’s no real close neighbors nearby,\" said Sherry Battisti, who has been a nurse at Mary Cariola Children's Center at the Elmwood campus for about nine years. She is one of five nurses who work as a team taking care of the 400 kids there.\nErnie Hayward, vice president of residential supports and services at Lifetime Assistance, declined comment regarding his agency's involvement, saying discussions were in early stages. Lifetime Assistance provides residential services to more than 500 children and adults with developmental disabilities in a variety of settings and neighborhoods throughout the greater Rochester area, according to its website.\nThe cost of the new home would typically be in the range of about $800,000 to $900,000, Sherry Battisti said, but she believes the cost could be significantly lower thanks to the generosity of local contractors. The goal at their gofundme.com site is $500,000.\n“There are quite a few companies who said they would do the roofing and siding, the masonry work, (Michael's) landscaper is going to do that when the time comes,” Sherry Battisti said. “A lot of them have known my husband for 40 years, they know he’s a really hard worker, he’s always donated to other people and helped them, so I think it’s nice that they want to give back to him now.”\nPlus, she said, people are realizing that autism and other developmental disabilities are a growing problem.\n“People know there are a lot more kids with these issues than there ever used to be,” she said.\nBuy Photo Jon Hand.
