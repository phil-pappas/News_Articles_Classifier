Others tried, of course, but a sad flashback where baby Lucious tries to care for his ailing mother just can't compete with the unbridled joy of the White-Suited Wonder. Spoilers ahead!\nBecky G, Kelly Rowland, and Andre Royo Share Tweet Pin E-mail Fox All three returned to play the same people they did last week , which makes sense but was also still a bummer because I can't be the only person hoping Kelly might suddenly switch roles and show up as a vocal coach for Mirage à Trois. It does seem like Thurston (Andre Royo) is now acting as a lawyer, secretary, and press rep for Lucious all at once, so hopefully he asked for a raise.\nSway Calloway Share Tweet Pin E-mail Fox More From Cosmopolitan Playing himself, MTV mainstay Sway hosted Hakeem on his radio show, which led to Hakeem making the idiotic statement that his girl group would be ready in three days. Hakeem, Hakeem, Hakeem. Will you ever learn? The only reason this was forgivable is because it meant Cookie got to play coach and teach them how to dance. \"Where'd you learn this from?\" Hakeem asked his mom. Cookie: \"Prison.\" End Hakeem's poor decisions, at least until next week.\nTimbaland Share Tweet Pin E-mail Fox The show's music supervisor stopped by Leviticus to perform with Hakeem, who led the Lyon Dynasty in crashing Lucious's welcome-home-from-jail party. Everyone but Lucious was amused, because hello, it was Timbaland. They could have kicked everybody but Timbaland out of the club right then and it would still have been the best party of the year.\nPitbull Share Tweet Pin E-mail Fox Ah, yes, Mr. Worldwide. Like Sway, he played himself, joining Jamal for a song at Leviticus. He then complimented Cookie on her party-crashing abilities and offered her a stage at his New Year's Eve party in Miami, but she remained noncommittal either because Cookie doesn't care for Pitbull or Lee Daniels couldn't get him for two episodes. Until next week, give this look to every family member who's trying to ruin your business!\nGIF Share Tweet Pin E-mail ​Follow Eliza on Twitter .", "external_links": ["http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/980x553/gallery-1444321166-sway.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/980x549/gallery-1444321253-timb.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1600x800/landscape-1444321326-pitbull.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1600x800/landscape-1444321564-becky.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/640x359/gallery-1444321564-becky.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1600x898/gallery-1444321326-pitbull.jpg", "http://www.twitter.com/thompsonplaid", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/768x430/gallery-1444321253-timb.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/768x431/gallery-1444321326-pitbull.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1600x800/landscape-1444321166-sway.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/640x358/gallery-1444321253-timb.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1600x896/gallery-1444321253-timb.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/980x550/gallery-1444321326-pitbull.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/768x431/gallery-1444321564-becky.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/480x271/gallery-1444321166-sway.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/980x550/gallery-1444321564-becky.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/480x269/gallery-1444321253-timb.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/768x433/gallery-1444321166-sway.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/480x269/gallery-1444321326-pitbull.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1600x800/landscape-1444321253-timb.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1280x723/gallery-1444321166-sway.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/640x359/gallery-1444321326-pitbull.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/640x361/gallery-1444321166-sway.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1280x719/gallery-1444321564-becky.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1280x719/gallery-1444321326-pitbull.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/480x269/placeholder_gallery-1444321506-terrence.gif", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1600x899/gallery-1444321564-becky.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1444321506-terrence.gif", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/480x269/gallery-1444321506-terrence.gif", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/placeholder_1444321506-terrence.gif", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/480x269/gallery-1444321564-becky.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1280x717/gallery-1444321253-timb.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1600x904/gallery-1444321166-sway.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T20:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:27:47.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
