The Wounds of the Soul puts the symptoms of PTSD into an understandable and easily recognizable format to foster better understanding of PTSD. Author Jim Money , together with other veterans and their spouses, garnered a wealth of information about PTSD through counseling and living with the disorder for more than 40 years.\nThere are millions of men and women who have faithfully served in the armed forces of this nation, fighting evil and terrorism around the globe. They put their lives on hold as they follow orders to locate, fight and destroy those who commit crimes against society. Unfortunately for them, their battles don't end when they return home from the battlefield. These soldiers, their families, and their communities still continue to combat a silent and disruptive enemy called PTSD, caused by experiencing traumatic events.\nThis book hopes to help educate those suffering from PTSD along with their families and friends. Using a narrative format, written by veterans' family members, this book describes real-life experiences of turmoil and upheaval, and their attempt to expose the symptoms thus allowing intervention and the saving of lives.\nThis book is available online and can be purchased at www.amazon.com and www.barnesandnoble.com .\nAbout the Author\nJim Money served almost 15 years in the United States Army.
