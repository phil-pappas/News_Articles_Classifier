Comer Memorial Library in Sylacauga on Oct. 14. (Carla Jean Whitley | cwhitley@al.com) Comments \nWhen historians look at a problem, they seek the most plausible answer. \nWith regard to Harper Lee's \"Go Set A Watchman,\" a source of controversy in the publishing world this summer, historian and author Wayne Flynt says the simplest answer is true. \n\"The most plausible story about what could happen historically is most likely to be true,\" Flynt said to a near-full auditorium at the B.B. Comer Memorial Library in Sylacauga. \nDuring his Wednesday lecture, \"In Sylacauga, Who is the Watchman? And What is She Watching?,\" Flynt discussed the cast of characters surrounding Lee and this controversy and the varying lenses through which the public was given information. \nIf you were a neurologist brought in on an elder abuse case to investigate whether Lee was capable of consenting to the book's publication, you would be concerned with her cognitive state. If you're a historian, you're looking for fact. Journalists may be interested in the perceived controversy because it grabs attention, said Flynt, who is also a friend of Lee's. \nThe months following announcement of Lee's novel were filled with media and literary debate over whether the author was of sound mind. Flynt suggested the anonymous sources whose concerns were often cited by media outlets may be Marja Mills, author of \"The Mockingbird Next Door\" (and subject of a lawsuit filed by Lee's now-deceased sister Alice Lee and her law partner Tonja B. Carter) and Tom Butts, a Methodist minister who was close to the sisters until he told unflattering stories about Harper Lee to a New York audience. \nFlynt says those he suspects of being \"anonymous\" sources haven't seen Lee in a decade. And when did Flynt last see her? \n\"Last Friday.\" \n\"Tonja Carter won't talk because she's a lawyer and doesn't feel she can talk to media and carry on legal proceedings,\" Flynt said. Lee's family is sworn to secrecy. Instead, Flynt has been a popular media source in the months since the book was announced. \nNow, three months after the book's publication, it is still a subject of debate. But it will hold up to the scrutiny of time, Flynt says. \n\"(Editor) Tay Hohoff said, 'America's not really ready for this book,'\" Flynt said. Hohoff's reasons are unclear. But Hohoff saw something appealing in the manuscript, and so Lee spent three years rewriting the book. The result was \"To Kill A Mockingbird.\" \nThe decades separating the two books—published 55 years and three days apart—fed the controversy. But Flynt asked the crowd, if you start out with \"To Kill A Mockingbird,\" where do you go? \n\"Perhaps that's why she waits till she's 89 to give permission\" for \"Watchman's\" publication, he said. \nBefore accepting audience questions, Flynt urged those gathered to read the book: \n\"You'll like Atticus better because he's not perfect.\" \nFollowing Flynt's lecture, library director Dr. Shirley Spears and resident sculptor Craigger Browne presented him with a heart sculpted of white marble, inscribed with the words \"This is the heart of Sylacauga.\" The duo also gave Flynt a smaller heart on a necklace for his wife. \n\"Dr. Flynt has been very instrumental, as has (historian) Dr. Leah Rawls Atkins, in helping bring this library to the place where you are now,\" Spears said. \nFlynt replied in kind: \"If your objective is to get me to do the next series, I'll do it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T00:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:38:52.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
