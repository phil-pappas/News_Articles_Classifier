For instance, you’ve heard the expression: We only use 10 percent of our brains. Not true, says the 44-year-old scientist.\n“It turns out we use 100 percent of our brain all the time,” he says. “It’s always active.”\nAh, that’s the rub.\nTurns out there is so much more to that statement. In the show, we meet a girl who had a particular kind of epilepsy for which the only solution was to remove half of her brain.\n“You see a CAT scan and there’s just blackness in one half of the brain,” says Eagleman. “If you do that kind of surgery under the age of 8, a child will be totally fine. All of the functions that would have been taken care of with the other hemisphere get mapped onto the single remaining one. You can’t do that in an adult, they’ll die. But children’s brains are sufficiently plastic.”\nEagleman notes that hundreds of children have gotten the procedure and function fairly normally, although they may have a weakness on one side of the body.\nAs we walk in a large ballroom at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, the scientist points out how much our gray matter is doing without us realizing it, from keeping our balance to forming words and to avoiding things in our path.\n“What’s remarkable about our brains is that it’s such a flexible kind of material — something we have no idea how to build yet,” he says. “If you tore half a computer out, it wouldn’t work. But if half your brain’s not there, it will just think, ‘Well, I’ve got less material. How do I make this work?’ And it figures out what to do.”\nThat is, providing you are young enough. But even if we lose one of senses when we are older, our brain compensates, Eagleman explains.\n“Currently, your brain allocates a lot of its real estate to hearing, sight, touch, smell and taste, but if you were to go blind, your visual cortex would just be taken over by your other senses,” says Eagleman. “Conversely, if I added a new sensor to the brain, it would just reallocate your real estate to make room for it.”\nAnd now we are talking about the future.\nAdvertisement\nIn another scene in “The Brain” a woman is shown controlling a robotic arm. Eagleman explains that she has lost the connection between brain and her body. So by plugging two electrodes into her motor cortex they can eavesdrop on those signals, decode them and pass them on to the mechanical arm. The scientist expects to see more of that in the next decade, perhaps even the ability to control exoskeletons.\nStill, despite how far we have come in our knowledge of the brain we have so much farther to go, the scientist says. You read about attempts to map the brain, but Eagleman says it is much more complicated than that.\nOne episode deals with the issues of the social brain, and “how so much of our circuitry is devoted toward dealing with other brains,” the scientist continues.\n“We’re extremely wired up to be a social species. It’s what holds us together,” he says. “Things like empathy are the glue that allows us to step into each other’s shoes and see stuff. I explore this issue to try to understand what it is about things like genocide.”\nThe last episode deals with where we are going with all our scientific advances — or rather what we are going to be.\n“We’re at a moment in human history when the marriage of our biology and our technology will transcend the brain’s limitations. We can hack our own hardware to steer a course into the future,” Eagleman writes in “The Brain: The Story of You,” the companion book to the series.\nIt’s a concept called “transhumanism,” and it’s possible our decedents in 500 years will have less in common with us than we have with our Stone Age ancestors from thousands of years ago.\nChanging who we are has been going on for a long time, notes Eagleman, from putting a cast on a broken bone to eyeglasses to pacemakers and beyond.\n“We’ve been used to the certain portals to the world, but what if you can plug into a much bigger sensory world out there?” he asks. “We’ve been making changes a long time; so it’s not clear that we are talking about any difference in kind but just in degree.”\nEagleman, however, stresses that it’s important for science not to move ahead of its moral compass.\n“It’s important for scientists to be involved in issues about legislation and societal issues in social policy,” he says. “Otherwise, it’s like Wernher Von Braun saying he launches the rockets and doesn’t care where they come down. We should care were they come down.”\nWhere to watch What: Six-part series examining the inner working of the brain.\nWhen: Premieres 10 p.m. Wednesday.\nWhere: PBS.\nAbout the Author Reach the author at rob.lowman@dailynews.com or follow Rob on Twitter: @roblowman1 .\nFull bio and more articles by Rob Lowman Back to top", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/roblowman1", "http://mn1-laweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/persbilde?Avis=LA&ID=10"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:42:46.556+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
