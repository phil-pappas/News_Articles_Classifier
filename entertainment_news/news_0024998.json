I love the look with the glasses and the hair,\" Williams said. \n\"It's like the secretary look. Which reminds me, I've got to clear my browsing history on my computer before Ayda (Field, Williams' wife) sees it.\" \nWilliams then asked Morgan how old she was - only to discover that she was celebrating her 15th birthday. \n\"Oh shit, that joke just ...\" Williams said, trailing off before pleading with fans to refrain from putting the video on YouTube. \n\"It'll be on YouTube, and then it'll be in the newspapers, and then I'll get arrested.\" \nWilliams dedicated his next song, She's the One, to Morgan and her mother, then offered her some life advice. \n\"How do you dig yourself out of that one? Stay away from boys like me Morgan.\" editors picks", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T04:01:42.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
