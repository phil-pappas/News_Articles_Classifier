ROSS LIKE A BOSS \nRoss Cockrell now has one fewer interception and as many fumble recoveries than Cortez Allen had last season. Allen was out with a knee injury but Cockrell, who was signed on Sept. 5 after being released by Buffalo, made the most of his opportunity. In the first half, Cockrell picked off an ill-advised Joe Flacco pass and returned it 37 yards to the Baltimore 36 but the Steelers were unable to capitalize. It was the first career interception for Cockrell, who continues to be used in the nickel package ahead of Brandon Boykin. On Baltimore's first possession of the second half, Cam Heyward stripped Flacco but Cockrell, falling to the ground while keeping his tippy-toes in-bounds, recovered the loose ball. It was not only an athletic play but the kind of heads-up play you'd expect from a Duke grad, whose dad played at Columbia. \n2. NOTHING SPECIAL \nIf the Steelers are going to have success in this four-to-six-week window without Ben Roethlisberger — or whatever it ends up being — they will need help from their special teams. They did not get it Thursday. Rookie punter Jordan Berry's first two punts went 75 yards. Combined (38 and 37 yards). \nWith the Steelers clinging to a 20-14 lead in the third quarter, Berry hit a 41-yarder that gift-wrapped Baltimore good field position, starting at the Pittsburgh 28. That's not going to cut it in the best of times. Berry, who made Brad Wing expendable, has the leg but he has to find consistency. After making two kicks earlier, Josh Scobee missed on attempts of 49 and 41 in the second half that could have sealed victory. Sixth-round pick to Jacksonville be damned, don't be surprised to see the Steelers bring in another kicker. \n3. I AM SAMMIE \nDesperate times call for desperate measures. In a perfect world, the Steelers probably would have liked to bring Sammie Coates along slowly as they did last season with Martavis Bryant, who didn't play until Week 7. Well, with Bryant out another week with his suspension, it opened a spot for Coates. The third-round pick, who was picked because of fears that Bryant might, you know, be suspended, picked up the first catch of his young career, an 11-yard pass from Vick in the flat in the second quarter. Coates is a work in progress and mistakes are inevitable but the Steelers need all hands, even slippery one's like Coates', on deck.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:41:14.081+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
