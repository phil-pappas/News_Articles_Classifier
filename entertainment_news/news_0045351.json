For him, it's a title that could signify a lot and very little, and he likes it that way. \"I don't think we should take names too seriously and look into meaning too much,\" he says. \"But it is part of the playground in which the whole process is taking place, and creating is also the search for the name.\"\nLast Work , which premiered in July, is one of two programs Batsheva brings to Melbourne Festival. It's an exploration of the body in motion; one of its core elements is a dancer whose sole task is to run on the spot for the duration of the piece. The figure of the runner came early in the creative process, Oharin says, and has been an important part of the work's development. The runner has no direct interaction with the rest of the choreography, yet is integral to it. \"It gave us a different sense of timing, of how we relate to time and space.\"\nThe original score for Last Work is written by a German composer, Grischa​ Lichtenberger, whose music Naharin came across by chance. He was listening to a favourite composer on his laptop, and a suggestion came up on his screen: \"If you like Alva Noto, you might like Grischa Lichtenberger.\" Naharin listened, was taken by what he heard, and immediately got in touch with the composer. Two weeks later, Berlin-based Lichtenberger​ was in Tel Aviv, working with the company on the new piece.\nGerman composer Grischa Lichtenberger found writing for dance a revelatory experience.

It was vital that he spent time with the company, Naharin says. \"It is hugely important we got to know each other, to know that until the last moment we can modify, change and learn about each other. It wasn't 'Give me music and I'll use it.'\" Lichtenberger​ hadn't written for dance before, and found it a revelatory experience, according to Naharin. \"Looking at his music meeting the dance, he saw something totally new. But also he showed me something new, which was really important for the piece for me.\"\nBatsheva has a junior ensemble that is a pathway to the senior company, and dancers spent two or three years there. \"When they join the ensemble, I'm interested in what you can call the hidden treasures,\" Naharin says. \"Maybe there's a dancer who is hugely talented, but for some training reason or emotional reason, something is blocked. And it's important to recognise this potential. Once you can give them keys to open up those treasures, they can offer you something much bigger than what you can teach them. But when I choose people for the company, I need to see how people are utilising those treasures.\" What he looks for is more than technical ability, he says. \"There's the important aspect of generosity, curiosity, intelligence, longevity, all those things that have to do with being able to cope with a full-time dance company for the long term.\"\nLast Work is an exploration of the body in motion.

In 2000, when Naharin was celebrating his 10th anniversary with Batsheva, he put together what he thought would be a one-off event, an evening of selections from 10 of the works he had made for the company. \"It was fun and it was a kind of learning experience, looking at our work from a new angle, allowing us to perform things we hadn't done for a time or wouldn't do otherwise.\" So it became an evolving feature, updated over time. \"It has allowed to do us a work that's constantly changing, what we do today is not what we did 10 years ago, and we keep changing and playing with it.\"\nAs an Israeli company, Batsheva can be the subject of political demonstrations when it performs overseas. \"Usually the demonstrations are pro-Palestinian and against the occupation. And I am against the occupation and pro-Palestinian,\" Naharin says. While he understands the motives of the protests, he questions their efficacy. \"Sadly, I don't think they help. I think the demonstrators are missing the point of who we are, the Batsheva Dance Company, we belong to the group of people who bring the change our region needs. We represent something that needs support instead of boycott.\"\nDecadance at State Theatre, Arts Centre Melbourne, on October 15. Last Work is at the State Theatre on October 17 and 18. \nfestival.melbourne", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T05:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T06:18:58.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
