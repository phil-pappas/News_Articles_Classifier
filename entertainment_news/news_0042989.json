Founded in 2015, NEXTGEN+MVPs is an eSports sponsorship consultancy that has worked with eSports teams, sponsors and publishers on a global scale to maximize eSports partnerships. The acquisition and creation of rEvXP bolsters rEvolution's expertise in the emerging eSports gaming arena.\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151001/273098LOGO\n\"When rEvolution was founded more than 14 years ago it was because we saw a need to provide new levels of expertise to brands for better communication in sports,\" said John Rowady , rEvolution's founder. \"Today, we see an immediate market need to translate eSports for brands. We've collaborated with the best minds in the business to put forward an expertise for brands that does not exist today.\"\nNEXTGEN+MVPs was founded by media and gaming industry veteran, Dan Ciccone , an established eSports marketer, who has worked on domestic and international programs with Fortune 500 clients and has served as Regional VP for Major League Gaming and as Director of Central Region sales with IGN Entertainment. The firm began working with OpTic Gaming in 2015, the most recognized team in eSports. Ciccone will serve as Managing Director of rEvXP, and will oversee all digital media operations and brand sponsorships opportunities.\n\"We have been on the ground level of eSports for years and know how to navigate and create unique opportunities,\" Ciccone said. \"Tapping into rEvolution's existing integrated service model with rEvXP is incredibly exciting, as it allows us to push the eSports industry as a whole further and faster.\"\nCiccone has worked closely with founder and CEO of OpTic Gaming, Hector Rodriguez , for years and has helped the team attract marquee sponsorships, in addition to expanding the brand and its impressive social footprint. OpTic Gaming is the first eSports team in X Games history to win back-to-back gold medals for Activision's Call of Duty . As part of the rEvXP acquisition, Hector Rodriguez will be responsible for creative direction, content creation and engagement programs with eSports influencers on behalf of brands.\n\"Working with Dan's team has allowed us to gain new sponsors and increase our exposure,\" said Hector Rodriguez , owner and manager of OpTic Gaming. \"As we look to expand and build upon what OpTic has already achieved, the partnership with rEvolution's sports marketing reputation and credentials made a lot of sense for where we all want to see brands connect with eSports. There are massive marketing and media opportunities in eSports, and this new team offers an inside look for brands to connect with fans.\"\nWith a client roster that includes Chipotle, Continental Tire, Northwestern Mutual and Polaris ORV, rEvolution has an industry-leading presence in the sports landscape. Previous gaming experience includes work with Electronic Arts on both the EA SPORTS FIFA and Need for Speed™ franchises.\n\"There's no questioning the tremendous growth potential for eSports,\" said Rowady. \"For brands, getting involved at an impact level, instead of on the ground floor in a 'learning curve' and authentically navigating the space through rEvXP, will be revolutionary – and we're excited to help them get there.\"\nThe acquisition of NEXTGEN+MVPs by rEvolution has led to the formation of the subsidiary, rEvXP, which will be headquartered in Chicago . In addition to Ciccone, Rodriguez and rEvolution's integration engine, rEvXP will have an advisory board, with strategic insight from rEvolution founder and CEO, John Rowady and Brian Quarles , SVP, Creative Director, as well as other notable industry veterans including Matt Davis , Global Communications, Dell; Jimmy Chamberlin , CEO and Co-Founder, LiveOne Inc..; and Frank Puma , Director, Digital Investment, MindShare NY.\nFor more information on rEvXP visit http://www.revXP.com .\nAbout rEvolution:\nrEvolution is an independent, fully-integrated sports and lifestyle marketing and media agency, which creates memorable, brand-building marketing programs within the sports and lifestyle space.
