For the uninitiated, most American cat cafes are places where cat lovers and coffee enthusiasts can relax and enjoy a cup of joe in the company of a roaming pack of adoptable cats. (Two of our favorite things!) Planning a trip soon and want to make sure you get your fill of purrs and meows while you’re away from home? Here are 10 cat cafes across the country worth a visit: 1. Blue Cat Cafe (Austin, Texas) Austin’s Blue Cat Cafe just opened earlier this month , offering a vegan barbecue food trailer and coffee (along with the cats, of course, who come from the Austin Humane Society). The cafe, which raised money through a Kickstarter campaign, has also hosted dog adoption events out front. We love the cat beds designed to look like instruments! 2. The Cat Café (San Diego, California) In downtown San Diego’s Marina District, feline lovers unite at the Cat Café , another spot offering adoptable cats and coffee. The cafe’s founder, Tony Wang, got money for his venture from a successful appearance on NBC’s “Shark Tank.” Open since January, the cafe’s cats come from the San Diego Humane Society, and Wang says they have adapted really well to the space. 3. Cat Town Café (Oakland, California) Oakland’s Cat Town Cafe opened its doors in October 2014, making it the first cat cafe in the U.S.A. Organizers said their aim was to promote cat adoptions by taking adoptable cats out of shelter cages and putting them into an environment where people can meet them and play with them. Many of the cats are shy, older cats that would otherwise killed at a shelter, co-founder Annie Dunn told The New York Times earlier this year. 4. Denver Cat Company (Denver, Colorado) Denver Cat Company is a cat adoption center as well as a cafe and a bookstore. So far, the space has adopted out 75 cats, according to the DCC website. Cats come from three local rescue organizations (For the Love of Paws, Planet Pet and PawsCo) and are given a quiet space at the back of the store to hang out in, if they’re feeling like they need a little alone time. 5. Meow Parlour (New York City) Got a NYC landlord who won’t let you keep a pet at your apartment? Visit Meow Parlour for all of the feline time that you need, and stop by the parlour’s adjoining cafe for sweet treats. Meow Parlour also partners with KittyKind, a no-kill rescue organization that can help you adopt a cat if you make a connection with one while you’re there. Make sure to make your reservations in advance; the parlour doesn’t have many spots for walk-ins.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:03:09.275+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
