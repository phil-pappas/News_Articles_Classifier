However, if I should say EXACTLY the same thing to a black person, I would immediately be labeled a “racist.”\nBlacks know this, and use it as their favourite trump card in any argument.\nLet me put it this way:\nIf I should complain about my white neighbour’s mongrels making a racket, my white neighbour would probably tell me to go to hell – even though I have nothing against white neighbours per se .\nBut, if I should complain about my black neighbour’s dogs barking, my black neighbour would immediately call me a racist – even though I have nothing against dogs per se .\nI mean, just look at what happened to poor old Dianne Kohler Barnard. (And she didn’t even complain about her neighbour’s barking dogs, or bucking docks , as they are called as locally.) She just wanted old *P.W Botha back.\nPersonally, I’m sick and tired of black racists calling whites racists, and white racists calling blacks racists.\nLet’s just get on with our lives and at least try to live in harmony.\n*The “ Groot Krokodil ” died on the 31 st of October 2006. Imagine what he would look like if he really had to come back today. Scary thought, huh?\nPS Answer to the first two questions: Just bliksem ignore him, walk away, and get over it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:33:51.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
