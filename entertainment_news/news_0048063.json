It was also a love triangle. I thought of it as a reference but now it is getting tagged with it. It’s good if people are thinking in that way,” Vishal said. Talking about the film’s story, Vishal said “It is a love story based in the 1940s in the backdrop of World War II. In history very few people know that India was also involved in the war. On the Burma border the British Indian army was fighting against Subhash Chandra Bose’s INA (Indian National Army), who were then with Japanese army and Indians were killing Indians at the Burma border.” “Rangoon” stars Shahid Kapoor, Saif Ali Khan and Kangana Ranaut. It’s scheduled to take off in early 2016. Related Posts", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T15:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T15:51:18.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
