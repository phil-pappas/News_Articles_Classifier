Its submission, \"Mustang,\" is the first feature film of Franco-Turkish director Deniz Gamze Erguven about five sisters living in a village in northern Turkey.\nThe last time France submitted a non French-language movie was in 1960, when its Portuguese-language submission, \"Black Orpheus,\" won the Oscar. France last won an Oscar in 1993 with \"Indochine,\" starring Catherine Deneuve.\nRules require that films were shown in theaters in their home countries between October 1 last year and September 30 this year.\nThe list will be trimmed to nine contenders a week before the January 14 announcement of nominations for all categories at the Oscars, the climax of Hollywood's annual awards season.\nThe Academy Awards, scheduled to be held on February 28, is televised live in more than 225 countries around the globe.\nThe full list of this year's foreign language contenders can be seen at: http://www.oscars.org/news/81-countries-competition-2015-foreign-language-film-oscar\nArts & Entertainment Movies Paraguay Afghanistan Vietnam", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:24:19.394+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
