They are bending fashion rules and doing it unapologetically. Far from protocol, the new breed of actors is adding a touch of quirk to their attire and more or less flouting the mundane, oft-defined fashion rules.\nWhile the men are boldly flaunting floral prints and lacey suits, the women , too, are not shying away from making snazzy, almost in-your-face sartorial statements. We take a look at some fashion rebels who don't give two hoots about playing by the rules.\nKangana Ranaut\n\nThis girl has grit. The fact that she has made several cringeworthy fashion choices apart from couture geniuses only makes her an even more valid contender for this spot. Lets face it, a risqu√© fashion choice is oddly appealing. From breezy, feminine dresses to femme fatale extraordinaire numbers, she wears them all and wears them with style.\nShruti Haasan\n\nIf there's one girl who deserves the 'Gen Next style progeny' title, it's Shruti. While her fashion sense includes a bit of flowers, lace, bohemian prints and a lot of grunge, metal, ripped jeans and rock 'n' roll, she doesn't shy away from experimenting. She also plays around with hair colours and trends, giving them a twist of her own.\nAlia Bhatt\n\nWhy bother spending hours mulling over dresses and jewellery when it all gets over in a fleeting moment anyway? Alia wears those cool, fresh clothes with gay abandon. You almost don't care if she's made a groundbreaking, brave fashion choice or a lazy, effortless one. Fashion runways and tabloids have fed us with rules and definitions galore, so it's a treat to see someone laidback and hip even though very much in the public domain.\nKalki Koechlin\n\nFor a while, Kalki oscillated between the comfortable and the untested. When she finally got out of those routine dresses, we saw an edgy mix of fierce and ballsy style that has become exclusive to her. We like the high hippie vibes the actress exudes through her public appearances that border on mischief.\nRanveer Singh\n\nThere's something about some good old-fashioned rebellion that can make anyone sit up and notice. Case in point: Ranveer Singh. The man is confidently trampling over conventional fashion rules and doing it with a cool, easy flair. Right from dainty floral prints to elegant pastels, his style often borders on bizarre and we can't help but admire his guts. He even stepped onto the red carpet in pajamas with his shirt reading: no f**ks to give. We believe that, Ranveer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:56:28.077+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
