It was awful, but it also showed me how much love and support I have in this world,\" the comic said in his opening monologue. \n\"People are wondering, 'Can he speak? Does he have 100 percent mental capacity?'\" he asked. \"The truth is, I never did. I might even be a few points higher.\" \nIn one sketch, he was joined by 30 Rock co-stars Tina Fey, Alec Baldwin, Jane Krakowski and Jack McBrayer. Fey broke character to inject a serious note: \"We're so happy you're OK. We're even happier you're ready to make people laugh again.\" \nMorgan also brought back a couple of his familiar characters — Astronaut Jones (stranded on Mars, a la Matt Damon in The Martian ) and animal expert Brian Fellow (joined by a real camel, who mostly cooperated). \nMorgan suffered severe head trauma in June 2014 when a truck on the New Jersey Turnpike slammed into the back of the limo van he was riding in. Comedian James \"Jimmy Mack\" McNair, a mentor of Morgan's, was killed in the crash. Morgan was in a coma for two weeks. Three other passengers suffered serious injuries. \nWatch the opening monologue here:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:47:46.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
