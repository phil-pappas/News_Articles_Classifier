Not the lottery with a capital \"L,\" but the one sponsored by the Cubs to secure postseason tickets at face value.\nBoth he had his 18-year-old son, Steven, had thrown their names in the ring, but only Steven was selected — and he found out about it only after checking his email a day after the winners were notified.\nBut that would turn out to be a blessing. After logging in to buy tickets for Monday's Game 3, Maier said \"we made a couple of mistakes on the website\" that bumped their options down to standing room only. They moved on to buy seats for Game 4, which at that point was an \"if necessary\" game.\nCubs win, happy chaos erupts at Bally Muck tavern in Waukegan Denys Bucksten Legions of Chicago Cubs fans stopped hoping Tuesday night and began believing in the young team's chances in postseason play.\nWith a dramatic division series win over the St. Louis Cardinals secured about 40 miles away at Wrigley Field, lifelong fans were able to celebrate Tuesday at Bally Muck...\nLegions of Chicago Cubs fans stopped hoping Tuesday night and began believing in the young team's chances in postseason play.\nWith a dramatic division series win over the St. Louis Cardinals secured about 40 miles away at Wrigley Field, lifelong fans were able to celebrate Tuesday at Bally Muck...\n(Denys Bucksten) A few clicks later, they had three lower-deck seats for about $100 each. Maier immediately checked an aftermarket website to learn that similar seats were already going for $300. They would be going for $400 after the Cubs won games two and three to force a fourth game.\nThen the fated date arrived. Maier and his son left mid-Michigan at 8 a.m. Central, arrived in Schaumburg to pick up his mom — your basic long-suffering Cub fan — around noon, headed straight for Wrigleyville and drove the 30 miles in the 90 minutes they had expected.\nThe path to glory continued with finding a free parking space a half-mile east of the park through \"a guy who knows a guy,\" catching a quick bite at Wrigley BBQ on Broadway, and getting inside the Friendly Confines with no security hassles despite a backpack full of water and beef jerky.\nAnd then there was the game experience itself. Singer John Vincent performing what Maier called \"the greatest rendition of the National Anthem I've ever heard.\" Javy Baez hitting an early three-run bomb that produced a head-numbing roar. All 42,000 fans going into a frenzy with the final out just after sunset.\nFirst in a century, Cubs clinch at Wrigley Field Brian Cassella The Chicago Cubs called last season \"The Party of the Century,\" an attempt to honor Wrigley Field's 100th birthday while distracting from their performance on the diamond.\nBut the first real party of the century happened last night as the Cubs clinched the NLDS with a Game 4 victory over their...\nThe Chicago Cubs called last season \"The Party of the Century,\" an attempt to honor Wrigley Field's 100th birthday while distracting from their performance on the diamond.\nBut the first real party of the century happened last night as the Cubs clinched the NLDS with a Game 4 victory over their...\n(Brian Cassella) The Maiers lingered to enjoy the moment, but not too long. They were on the road from Schaumburg by 8:30 p.m. and back in East Lansing at 12:30 a.m. without a moving violation. Mission truly accomplished.\n\"The biggest thing I thought about was, 'I get to share this with my mom, and she's a lifelong Cub fan,'\" Maier said, \"and then my son is 18 and has grown up in Michigan but still considers Chicago his home.\n\"So the fact that all those things came together is amazing,\" he added. \"Even the weather — I mean, there was nothing that went wrong.\"\nHere's hoping that smooth sailing continues for about the next two weeks.\ndanmoran@tribpub.com\nTwitter @NewsSunDanMoran\nCopyright © 2015, Lake County News-Sun Wrigley Field Opinion", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561e9da3/turbine/ct-first-in-a-century-cubs-clinch-at-wrigley-field-20151014", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561dbc03/turbine/ct-lns-cubs-playoffs-waukegan-st-1014-20151013", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561ea1ad/turbine/ct-lns-moran-cubs-tickets-st-1015-20151014"], "published": "2015-10-14T21:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:21:19.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
