Ashton thinks they really go above and beyond the call of grandparent duty, so he wanted to make a grand gesture.\" \nThe former 'That 70s Show' star splashed out $100,000 to revamp their kitchen, bathrooms and add a nursery to their property. \nAshton previously shared that the pair are enjoying bringing up their daughter without a nanny. \nHe said : \"We're really privileged that we have time and can afford to take time. So we don't have a nanny or a night nurse of any of that stuff. It's just the two of us.\" \nEarlier this year, the actor also renovated his mother's home in Homestead, Iowa for Mother's Day and documented the process online. \nHe said at the time: \"It's my way of saying thank you to my mom. My mom has been the greatest influence in my life - my parents gave me everything. They went to great sacrifices to give me the life that I have and anything I can do to say thank you is the right thing.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:48:40.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
