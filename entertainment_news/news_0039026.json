The order asks that Chief U.S. District Judge Philip Simon assign a new judge to the case.\nThe motion is connected to the former mayor's September trial in his first criminal case, where a federal jury convicted Soderquist and his wife, Deborah Soderquist, of using money from his campaign fund and the city's food pantry to pay for gambling trips to Four Winds Casino in New Buffalo, Mich.\nDefense attorneys Scott King and Lakeisha Murdaugh moved after the verdict for a new trial, arguing that Lozano fell asleep at least twice during the trial, impairing his ability to properly rule on motions throughout the trial.\nThey also filed a motion for Lozano to disqualify himself from the first case, although both that motion and the motion for a new trial are still pending.\nThey followed up these motions with a motion on Sept. 28 for Lozano to disqualify himself from Soderquist's second criminal case, in which he and his wife are accused of helping the mayor's stepdaughter hide her theft from the city when she worked at Lake Station as a court clerk.\nKing said he thought it was the right thing for Lozano to disqualify himself from the second case, noting that Lozano is now essentially a witness in the first case in regards to the motion for a new trial.\nHe added that the standard for judicial disqualification is if a third person had a reasonable question as to a judge's impartiality.\n\"I think a reasonable person could (in this case),\" King said.\ntauch@post-trib.com\nCopyright Â© 2015, Post-Tribune", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5616e0e7/turbine/ct-ptb-soderquist-new-judge-st-1009-20151008"], "published": "2015-10-08T23:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:36:19.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
