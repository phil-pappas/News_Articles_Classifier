Between the juicy drama happening now, and what occurs in two months, hold onto your wigs and pearls -- because it's about to go down. \nSeriously, if you have yet to watch the first episode -- let alone all the craziness that just transpired, CliffsNotes won't do it justice. \nTry to get on the train so you don't get left behind! \nWarning -- major spoilers ahead! \nSomething tells me this season of HTGAWM is going to be a hot mess bundled up with some tasty plotlines. We didn't even have time to deal with the fact that Bonnie killed Rebecca (no one else appears to know Rebecca is actually dead, except Annalise and Frank) without more potential murders popping up. Heck, we can't even get through a court case that deals with murder because folks are getting off left and right (Nate is finally a free man y'all!). \nIt's OK if you find yourself a little dumbfounded as something always happens during the last two minutes of the episode that can make you dazed and confused. \nAll I know is this: You can expect a test of loyalty, and lies to be uncovered. \nOne of the biggest tests that will unfortunately take some time to unravel is who the heck shot Annalise. We saw her bleeding on the ground inside the Hapstall mansion (you know, the home of adopted siblings, Caleb and Catherine Hapstall who may or may not have killed both their parents -- and now their aunt. What a mess!) last week, and now it's revealed all of the \"Keating 5\" (interns Wes, Michaela, Connor and Laurel) -- with the exception of Asher -- were standing over her body. \nAnnalise, girl, who pulled the trigger? \nAnd if that's not crazy enough, viewers now know Annalise wasn't the only one shot, as Nate's prosecutor, Emily Sinclair, appears to be dead in the front entrance! \nWhat?! \nSpeaking of Emily, how about that mini meeting she had in the parking garage with Asher?! This was definitely one of the biggest events to happen tonight as you would think Asher (a member of the Keating intern crew) would be on Team Annalise, but apparently not. Why the hell is he feeding this woman information in the first place? What did he tell her? Are they related? Is she tied to his family somehow (remember, his daddy is a dishonorable judge)? Who the heck knows. For now, we'll have to deal with Ms. Prosecutor as she took over the Hapstall case. \nAs much of a douche as Asher can be, he seems to be in bed with everyone (technically he's only sleeping with Bonnie...that we know of) in order to stay in the know. Bonnie might want to be careful how much she tells lover boy, as it might be used against her in the court of law. \nWhile we're on the subject of Bonnie, she gets the award for \"Most Loyal\" of the night. Call her psychotic or odd all you want, but this woman refuses to leave Annalise's side -- even when she told Bonnie, \"screw up again, and you'll be the next dead body in this house.\" Yes, their relationship is sloppy (Bonnie basically outed herself last season after coming clean to Annalise that she and her husband kissed), but this woman just won't go away. \nMaybe she needs to see a shrink for her co-dependency issues...and killing someone for the sake of a friendship that's likely a ploy. \nOne person who I do question is this Eve Rothlow (Famke Janssen). Things are getting a little too hot and steamy very fast. Did you see how quickly Eve played turncoat in the courtroom in order to get Nate off for murdering Annalise's husband? It was a great move on her part, but something tells me this \"I loved you and you left me\" bit doesn't come with its own set of strings. Hell certainly hath no fury like a woman scorned. Who knows, maybe she's sleeping with Nate on the side and the two will try to get back at Annalise for pinning her husband's death on him. \nOh you didn't think I forgot about this Levi character, did you? \nNope! \n\"Levi\" probably has a certain loyalty, but is lying about it. Yes, he's hot, but hopefully Michaela won't be fooled by this possible wolf in sheep's clothing. It's uncertain for now whether or not he's \"Eggs 911,\" but there's simply no denying his connection to this whole mess of a story -- especially when we see Wes pick up one of Rebecca's old photos that has him in it! I have no idea how he fits in, but Levi, we got our eye on you. \nIf this episode taught us anything, it's to trust no one (We'll save a discussion about those Hapstall kids later. Something's not right with them). \nUntil next time!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:01:29.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
