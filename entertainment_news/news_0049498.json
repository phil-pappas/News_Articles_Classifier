Grade: B- He did “Pretty Woman,” now Richard Gere is “Pretty (Homeless) Man” in Oren Moverman’s sanitized life-on-the-street drama “Time Out of Mind.” Clean, well-groomed and casually dressed, Gere looks about as homeless as Mitt Romney on a lazy weekend in which the former governor forgot to shave. Give Gere credit, though, for trying to dislodge himself from the rich-prigs he normally plays. But his commitment is lacking. Just compare his take on a mentally unbalanced street person to that summoned by Robin Williams in Terry Gilliam’s “The Fisher King,” a work of pure, persuasive genius. Williams was all in, both physically and psychologically. He frightened you almost as much as he broke your heart. Gere on the other hand, acts like an ambitious TV reporter, always conscious of his appearance, going undercover to do a story on what it’s “like” to be homeless. He wears ill-fitting clothes and acts “strange,” but you’re never convinced he spent his nights anywhere outside of a four-star Manhattan hotel. It borders on Eddie-Murphy-like vanity. But it’s hard to blame him. Largely shunned of late by youth-skewing Hollywood (Remember he was recently relegated to the out-to-pasture-cast of “The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.”), Gere dares to go outside the system to create a project of his own, playing a hand in every facet from shepherding the script to securing financing. He called in favors from friends like Kyra Sedgwick (outstanding as a can-collecting bag woman) and Steve Buscemi, used actual locations like Bellevue Hospital’s homeless shelter, and secured a fast-rising avant-garde filmmaker in Moverman (“The Messenger”) to lend the work style and substance. And it works – to an extent. The problem, ironically, is Gere. He wants to be actorly, but he’s clearly afraid to sacrifice his good looks. His George occasionally sleeps on the streets, but neither he nor his clothes ever collect a speck of dirt. Sedgwick, however, playing a former prostitute who broke free of her abusive pimp only to end up living out of a shopping cart, disappears completely into her role, shunning makeup and every ounce of ego. You wish the film were about her. But it’s about Gere, and that’s not good. Only when he starts interacting with his fellow street people – Sedgwick, Jeremy Strong and a superb Ben Vereen – does the film even begin to engage – and that’s nearly an hour in. Up to that point, Moverman lets his camera (manned by Bobby Bukowski) do the talking, making like Michael Ritchie in his Robert Redford period (“The Candidate,”“Downhill Racer”), when observational, minimal-dialogue filmmaking seemed cool. Nowadays, it just seems lazy and dull. But Bukowski’s camerawork is outstanding in its ability to capture the heartbeat of the unforgiving streets of Manhattan, where the homeless are about as welcome as a sewer rat. Page 2 of 2 - It’s mildly affecting, but nowhere near where it should be. Then, like a breath of stale, booze-soaked air, Vereen shows up as the motor-mouthed braggadocio Dixon. He literally follows Gere’s George everywhere, always talking a bluestreak. At first repulsed, George takes to him. And so do we. Suddenly, the film comes alive with feeling and verve. You even actually start to care if George will ever achieve his wish of reconnecting with his long-estranged daughter (Jena Malone). And even though the story resolves in a predictable way, you’re still marginally moved. Not by the father-daughter stuff, but by how a man like George has lost his identity, both in his head and in the government bureaucracy. “I have no ID,” George tells a social worker. And when he says that, the double-entendre makes your heart sink. It also suggests how poignant the film might have been if “Time” took you out of your mind and put you squarely in its.
