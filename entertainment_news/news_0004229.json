All songs had to be written and recorded from scratch within a day. \nMORE: Check out a Jersey lounge singer's bright pop debut \nThe site released the fruits of its bands' all-night labor last week, 37 fresh tracks that prove great songs can be written and recorded under the harshest of deadlines. \nHighlights from the mix include a trotting folk tune from Brick players Bone and Marrow, and a nearly six-minute offering from Jersey rocker Julian Fulton that feels impossibly polished considering the time constraint. \nEach song is available for free listening and/or purchase here , or you can listen below. All proceeds benefit the National Alliance on Mental Illness. \nGive the whole playlist a chance — these are some wonderfully talented local musicians. &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href=\"http://speakimge.bandcamp.com/album/the-2nd-annual-24-hour-songwriting-challenge\" data-mce-href=\"http://speakimge.bandcamp.com/album/the-2nd-annual-24-hour-songwriting-challenge\"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;The 2nd Annual 24 Hour Songwriting Challenge by Speak Into My Good Eye&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; \nBobby Olivier may be reached at bolivier@njadvancemedia.com.
