The 14-time Grand Slam winner won the inaugural edition of the ATP 500 event in 2014 before being eliminated by Italy’s Fabio Fognini in the semifinals of this year’s tournament. \n“The Rio Open is an important event on the tennis calendar in a special country,” the 29-year-old said in a statement on Thursday, Xinhua reported. ”I have developed a great relationship with the Brazilian public over the last two years and I love going back there,” Nadal said. Nadal endured a frustrating 2015, failing to win a Grand Slam for the first time in a calendar year since 2004. The 2016 Rio Open will be played at the Brazilian Jockey Club from February 15 to 21. \nTennis legends Rafael Nadal and Rod Laver — two of the greatest left-handed players in the history of the sport — joined forces here on Tuesday for the first ever international launch of the Australian Open. With less than 100 days to go until Australian Open 2016 gets under way at Melbourne Park on January 18, Tennis Australia Commercial Director Richard Heaselgrave announced a raft of innovations for the event. \n14-time Grand Slam champion Nadal said he was looking forward to returning to Melbourne Park, the scene of his 2009 title win. “Every year I look forward to play in Melbourne, I have great memories of not only winning the title but each year is a great experience for me as a player,” Nadal said \n  6:25 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:12:00.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
