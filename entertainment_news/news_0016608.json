Daniel Craig Shut Down an Interviewer Who Called Monica Bellucci an \"Older Woman\" 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nDaniel Craig took a stand against one of Hollywood's most egregious double standards while promoting the latest James Bond film, Spectre . \nIn an interview with The Red Bulletin (the official publication of Red Bull), Craig was asked about Bond \"succumbing to the charms of an older woman\" in Spectre. That would be Craig's co-star Monica Bellucci - who, at 51, is four years older than Craig. \nCraig had the perfect response to the cringe-worthy question. \"I think you mean the charms of a woman his own age,\" he said. \"We're talking about Monica Bellucci, for heaven's sake. When someone like that wants to be a Bond girl, you just count yourself lucky!\" \nWatch the action-packed newest trailer for Spectre \nThis isn't the first time Craig has flown the feminist flag. In March, he dressed in drag to film a video about gender inequality in honor of International Women's Day. Watch it here , and read Craig's full interview with The Red Bulletin here . \nSpectre is scheduled to be released on Nov. 6. \nOther Links From TVGuide.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:48:15.829+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
