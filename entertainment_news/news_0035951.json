(Photo: KVUE) CONNECT TWEET   \nAUSTIN -- Musicians are set to perform Oct. 17 to benefit an organization that helps children with brain injuries. \nBrianna Dupuie, 8, is among the musicians who will take the stage in hopes of earning studio time like this. In reality she's already won. \n\"She’s a miracle. She’s just a miracle,” said mom Dena Dupuie. “Doctors tell us she was within minutes of dying when she arrived at the hospital and now look at her.” \nBrianna was 12-months old when she was violently shaken. Dena and her husband became her foster parents months later and eventually adopted her. \n“When she came to us at 14 months she couldn’t walk, talk and she couldn’t even crawl, whereas before the injury she was a typically developing child,” said Dena. A stroke, seizures, surgeries and now scoliosis are all the result of her traumatic brain injury. \nEvery year, 62,000 children suffer a brain injury, and 1,300 of those suffer those injuries because of abuse. \nBrianna has needed help along the way and it didn't always come in the form you'd expect. \n“Brianna needed a stimulator for her leg, a walk aid and Medicaid wasn’t going to pay for it and Hope 4 Minds stepped up to the plate,” said Dena. \nHope 4 Minds is the organization another Austin family launched years ago after their son JD, nearly drowned. \n“We help families that have a child with an acquired brain injury. We help provide resources, support as well as financial assistance,” said Rhonda Johnson, executive director of Hope 4 Minds. \nAll of that help, is allowing Brianna to focus on what she loves: her music and her school work. So now this straight A student is singing another tune, one of philanthropist. \n“I want to raise money for special needs kids,” said Brianna. \nHer band, Beautiful Minds, will be among those performing in a Battle of the Bands competition in South Austin raising money for the organization that has helped her. \nProving music is not only good for the mind, it's essential for the soul. \nBenefit Details \nThe Battle of the Bands and family fun fest benefiting Hope 4 Minds takes place Saturday, Oct. 17 at the Rusty Mule off U.S. Highway 290.
