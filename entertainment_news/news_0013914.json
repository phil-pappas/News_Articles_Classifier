We want to be together the whole time and you’ll get the best out of me and Caroline, and our personalities and the banter we have together. \n“It’s going to be a lot of fun,” he added. \nOlly and Caroline replaced Dermot O'Leary earlier this year \nViewers could be set to see Olly and Caroline replicate the success of Dermot’s dance routines at the top of the show, following Caroline’s win on ‘Strictly’ last year. \n“Maybe we’ll do a dance routine or two, we’ll see what happens,” he teased. \n“For the first couple of weeks, we’ll be nervous and should be focusing on the show. It’s our first year so we don’t want to do too much too soon.” \nThe pair were recently nominated for a National Television Award for Best Presenter together, something which Olly described as “an incredibly proud moment” for them both. \nAnd much of their success is down to their great on-screen chemistry, with Olly revealing that they clicked instantly when they first met and hosted ‘The Xtra Factor’ together in 2011. \n“We first met each other and got straight onto camera and within 15 minutes of meeting each other, we had this instant connection. We just got on really, really well,” Olly explained. \n“We knew straight away that we had something special as a TV duo, and I think that we could go on and do a lot of big TV shows together.” \nOlly Murs’ new single ‘Kiss Me’ is out now, while his new book ‘On The Road Again’ is also on shelves now.
