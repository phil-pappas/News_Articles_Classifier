One of the movies at the convention which provides new revelations is \" Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice \". A new \"Batman v Superman\" video has been debuted, teasing LexCorp' next project, an operating system called Lex/OS. It's Lex Luthor Jr. ( Jesse Eisenberg ) who debuted the video advertising the forthcoming release of the operating system. The one-minute video also features the logo of the new software. \"At LexCorp Industries, we believe in technology that unites us, where inspiration, innovation and imagination all come together to create a greater tomorrow, today. Now, LexCorp is proud to announce Lex/OS the world's most private and secure operating system,\" someone says in voiceover, promising people \"a better tomorrow\". Although it's still unclear how the aformentioned operating system will fit the plot, Lex Luthor Jr. hinted, in a profile piece released by Fortune, that the product could save the world. \"We are on the cusp of unveiling a technology that will change the world forever. It's about safety,\" he said. \"This is a product that will protect you, and everyone, from threats you don't even know about yet. I don't want to scare anybody... much. But there are a lot of threats out there, and they're here today.\" Another details provided at the event are the concept arts of new costumes worn by some superheroes such as Superman ( Henry Cavill ), Batman ( Ben Affleck ) and Wonder Woman ( Gal Gadot ). The concept arts are included in a video in which costume designer Michael Wilkinson describes the designs. \"For Batman, it was really important for Zack that we created a whole new Batman,\" Wilkinson says in the video. \"And he said, 'The most important thing for our Batman is that he comes across a real hulking, big guy.' He's super-pumped up. He's going to be even bigger than Superman's silhouette.\" \"Batman v Superman\" will pit the Caped Crusader with the Man of Steel. Zack Snyder is directing with a script he co-wrote with Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer. Amy Adams , Jeremy Irons , Ray Fisher and Ezra Miller also star in the movie which is scheduled to be released in the U.S. on March 25, 2016. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T11:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:33:53.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
