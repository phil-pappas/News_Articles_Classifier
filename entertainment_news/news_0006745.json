At the same time, we hope that Iran's cancellation this year will only be a short interruption of the ongoing talks and that we will be able to expand and extend relations.\n\"It mustn't be forgotten that Rushdie is still facing a death threat because of his work,\" he said.\nThe organisers said that individual Iranian publishers would still be present and that they had increased their presence in recent years. \n\n- Indonesia guest stars -\nView gallery Juergen Boos, director of the Frankfurt Book Fair, has defended the choice of this year's speake … It is perhaps ironic that the guest country of this year's show is Indonesia -- the nation with the world's largest Muslim population.\nAbout 70 writers from the Southeast Asian nation will attend, including author Laksmi Pamuntjak who will present her latest book \"The Question of Red\", a love story set at in the 1960s, a period of violent repression against communists.\nThemes of barriers, borders and the fight against extremism will dominate during three days of discussions with 20 writers from around the world, led by Danish author Janne Teller.\nHeld for the second consecutive year, the discussions, titled \"Frankfurt Undercover\", are aimed at generating ideas aimed mainly at influencing political opinion.\nThe Frankfurt fair dates as far back as the Middle Ages with the invention of the Gutenberg press just down the road, and this year some 7,300 exhibitors will be present, with up to 300,000 visitors expected.\nAs in every edition, internationally renowned writers will be out in Frankfurt to promote their latest works, including Ken Follett, who is set to speak about the video game adaptation of his runaway success \"Pillars of the Earth\". \nChilean writer Isabel Allende, Denmark's Jussi Adler-Olsen and British anthropologist Nigel Barley are also among the attendees.\nThe show will be an occasion for the struggling book publishing industry -- with an estimated total value of 114 billion euros ($129 billion) worldwide -- to look for new ideas as younger generations turn their eyes increasingly online. \nThe consolidation of publishing houses -- reinforced by the birth in 2013 of the giant Penguin Random House -- the disappearance of major bookstore chains and the uneasy coexistence of paper and electronic publishing are also expected to be topics broached at the fair.\nRepresentatives of online retailer Amazon will likely be closely watched when they participate in round-table discussions at the show, which opens on October 14 and runs until October 18.\nMeanwhile, Germany, which is receiving a record number of refugees this year, will ensure that the newcomers are not left out from the major cultural event, by giving them free tickets to the fair and organising visits.\nThe question of access to culture in the refugee camps will be discussed at a conference during the fair, while the German writers' federation is expected to launch an appeal for solidarity for those who have fled their countries.\nArts & Entertainment Books & Publishing Salman Rushdie Frankfurt Book Fair Iran", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:49:30.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
