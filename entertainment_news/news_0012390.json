In less culturally sensitive times, Judi would have been described as Dave's \"Gal Friday,\" but today she's probably on the books as a \"multiplatform content-generation facilitator,\" because that's what all newspaper jobs sound like. The work, though, is pretty much unchanged: Dave depends on Judi for everything, and has done so since the waning days of the vice presidency of Dan Quayle. But Dave is also a guy, which is why I had no particular expectations when -- to test out a new anthropological theory of mine -- I emailed him to ask if he knew, off the top of his head, the color of Judi's eyes. He responded immediately.\n\"They might be blue,\" he said, which was not very helpful inasmuch as, technically speaking, that means they also might be orange.\nAfter thinking about it for a bit, however, Dave got back to me to clarify: \"I'm thinking they could be brown.\"\nOK then.\nSensing what my working hypothesis was, Dave remembered a pertinent conversation he once had: \"I was talking to a woman sportswriter. She covered a pro hockey team, which meant that after games she was in a locker room filled with naked guys, whom she had to interview. She told me: 'I knew ALL their eye colors.'\"\nExactly! Now, imagine what would have happened if the situation had been reversed, and it was a male sportswriter forced to interview naked female athletes. Would we be talking eye-color awareness? I think not. I think we'd be talking about sudden, catastrophic blood diversion from the brain, fainting, face plants onto cement, concussions, traumatic encephalopathy, etc.\nBut I digress. As a scientist, I had more gender-specific research to do.\nLynn and Sydney are two friends of mine, female editors at The Washington Post who have worked closely with my editor, Tom the Butcher. I asked them what color Tom's eyes were. This was to be purely from memory, and it was also something of a trick.\nTom's eyes resemble kaleidoscopes. They seem to pinwheel as you look at them. They are no hue, and they are all hues. His family laughingly calls them \"bile colored,\" but Tom indignantly insists they are \"variegated, with yellow, gold, green and light brown aspects.\" All in all, technically speaking, there is only a single word -- if an inadequate one -- that accurately applies to Tom's eyes: \"hazel.\"\nBack to the experiment.\nSydney: \"Tom's eyes are hazel. Definitely hazel.\"\nLynn: \"Hazel. Yellowishbrowngreen.\"\nNext, I asked Tom what color Sydney's eyes are.\n\"Brown!\" he said, confidently.\n(They're brown.)\nAnd Lynn's?\n\"Brown!\" He said, confidently.\n(They're green.)\n\"Do you always say brown, about everyone?\"\n\"Yes,\" he said, confidently. \"Brown is genetically dominant, so I'm playing the odds.\"\n\"What color are Lisa's eyes?\" I asked.\nSilence. Lisa is Tom's wife of 30 years. This was in real time, on the record. The stakes were suddenly enormous.\n\"Brown!\" Tom said, confidently.\n\"Wait, is that a guess?\"\n\"Well, before I answered you, I asked her.\"\n\"You asked her?\"\n\"I thought they were brown, but it was not impossible I was wrong.\"\nCase closed.\n===", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T01:30:43.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
