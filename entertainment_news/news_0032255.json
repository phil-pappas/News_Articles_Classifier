In fact, many people still eagerly await their onscreen reunion (including me).\nSo, how did it start for the two? Well, I got it straight from Gabby when I caught up with him recently.\nGABBY CONCEPCION\n“I was a little intimidated at first,” he said of their first movie together. “She was the (Pasay) mayor’s daughter and had bodyguards. We weren’t really talking so the film’s director, Danny Zialcita, devised a plan. He put us in a room, just me and Sharon. He said we needed to talk and be close because we had to shoot a scene that required us to be sweet to each other. Then he stood up and left the room, but not without telling us, ‘Mag-workshop na kayong dalawa.’”\nIt worked. “Dear Heart” was a huge hit and paved the way for their love team to become the biggest one in the ’80s, as big as today’s JaDine, KathNiel and AlDub combined – and that’s no exaggeration. I know throwbacks are reserved for Thursdays but that story is just so “kiligable,” especially for Sharon-Gabby fans like myself.\nAnyway, today, Gabby and Sharon live separate lives. Sharon is married to Sen. Kiko Pangilinan while Gabby is with Genevieve “Ginbee” Yatco Gonzales. “When I have no taping or show, I hang out with my kids,” Gabby said of his daughters with Ginbee. “I love playing Monopoly and Old Maid with them. My world revolves around them. I never had this chance with my three other daughters KC, Cloie and Garie.”\nGabby is happy to have been able to redeem himself in more ways than one. Career-wise, he likes it that fans gave him a second chance when he came back from the States in 2008. Recall that Gabby was away for more than a decade.\nThe actor added, “My children, Samantha and Savanah, gave me a second chance to be a good father and Gin gave me a chance to be a good husband.What more can I ask for?”\nHe credits Gin for being there when he was “no one and had nothing.” The two met when Gabby was working as real estate agent abroad.\n“Gin was there and loved me simply for who I am,” he said.\nNowadays, Gabby is often seen in the company of Cong. Albee Benitez, sparking rumors that the latter is convincing the former to run for public office. We asked Gabby about it and he let out a laugh.\n“Albee is my childhood friend and my best man. The reason that we have been hanging out a lot of late is because we are both into big game fishing,” he said. Turning serious, he added, “I have no plans to join public service. I believe I can help people in other ways.”\nTrivia: My funniest experience with Gabby was on a recent working trip to Rome. Somebody devised a game wherein Gabby and I were made to gather as many phone numbers from the opposite sex. Gabby won with 12 numbers.\nAs for me, I only managed to get one – from a Filipino priest at that!", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:13:44.562+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
