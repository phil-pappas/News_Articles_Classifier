Was it cool to be a part of this week’s Supernatural episode called “Baby” that fans are so anxiously waiting for?\nA. “Yes, absolutely. I think fans of the show love Dean's car 'Baby' as much as he does and are excited to see what happens with it.”\nQ. Not to get in to any spoilers, but can I just ask is your character Jessie someone fans will love or love to hate?\nA. “My character Jessie is a bad-ass. She does what she wants and loves the thrill. Jessie looks sweet and innocent but don't let that fool you! I think fans are going to have to decide whether they love her or love to hate her for themselves.”\nQ. What can you share about your roles in the upcoming films The Perfect Pickup ?\nA. “I play Maria in The Perfect Pickup , she's also a tough girl who doesn't get fooled easily. I love playing those types of characters. The Perfect Pickup is a movie about a couple of boys who try to come up with the perfect way to pickup women. They fool most of the girls in the movie, but I come in at the end and catch Corey in the act and watch while all his lies come undone.”\nQ. Were you born and raised in Vancouver? How did you catch the acting bug?\nA. “I was born in Ankara, Turkey and my parents moved to Vancouver when I was about a month old. I caught the acting bug in highs school during drama 10. I had a wickedly talented drama teacher and we performed plays at the school and helped raise money for various charities. After that, I decided to do what I love for a living.”\nQ. Do you have any “hidden talents” that you can share with your fans?\nA. “Hmm….well all my hidden talents are pretty hidden! JK, I'm like really good at speaking double dutch. It's a made up language me and my cousins started speaking in grade two, and yessss…I'm still fluent.”", "external_links": ["http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5293544/", "http://m.cwtv.com/shows/supernatural/", "https://youtu.be/vnC0g8udvpE"], "published": "2015-10-25T16:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T18:51:39.206+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
