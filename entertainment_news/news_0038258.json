The zoo is located in the northern Norwegian town of Narvik, and the animals are caged but exhibited in \"their natural surroundings.\"\nThe hunting party self-reported the incident, calling the zoo to let them know about the unfortunate accident. It seems their hunting dogs snuck into the moose exhibit so the hunters didn't realize there was a fence at all.\n\"This is a regrettable mistake made in connection with lawful hunting on the outside of the park,\" Troms County wildlife tribunal chairman Arne Nysted told The Local . \"It was a fatal error, but everyone understands that it was not done at all on purpose.\"\nPolar Park plans on asking the hunting party for compensation.", "external_links": ["http://www.thelocal.no/20151015/hunters-shoot-elk-in-zoo", "http://polarpark.no/polar-park-and-animals.html"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:14:25.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
