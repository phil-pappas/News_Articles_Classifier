The actor and Ellen DeGeneres decided to cook pasta together, but with a twist. The host kepts her arms behind her back and vocalized the cooking session, while Cooper stood behind her and used his hands to prepare the meal. The result was hilarious as Cooper had to cut a cucumber with a knife while his vision was partly blocked, risking to injure his fingers. At some moments, things went raunchy including when the \" American Sniper \" star made DeGeneres lick his fingers after tasting the cucumber, causing the audience to scream in excitement. Cooper and DeGeneres eventually completed the task and raised $10,000 for Breast Cancer Awareness Month. During a sit-down, DeGeneres talked about her famous Oscar selfie. \"You ruined it in the most perfect way!\" the comedienne said with a laugh. \"The whole joke was I was trying to break the internet so that Meryl [Streep] and I would have the most retweets...[But] The whole joke was I was going to try to get Meryl out of the picture to take the picture so she wouldn't be in it at all.\" She continued, \"I kept trying to get her out of the picture and you were like, 'No, no no! I got it.' And you took the best picture! It was fantastic.\" Cooper jokingly responded, \"Yeah! I was like, 'Ellen's got this thing! She's like short circuiting in front of billions of people!' \" Cooper also addressed filming \"American Sniper\" with a fake baby. He said, \"I literally couldn't believe it. Like I couldn't believe we were working with the plastic baby.\" He added, \"I was like, 'This is nuts.' \" He went on recalling that he joked with the crew that he moving the plastic doll's arm with his thumb would save the project $100,000 in computer-generated effects. \"Eat your heart out, Muppets,\" the movie hunk jokingly said. Cooper's new movie \"Burnt\" will hit theaters across the nation on October 23. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T07:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:29:03.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
