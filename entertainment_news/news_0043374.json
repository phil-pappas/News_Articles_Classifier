Want to take an excellent adventure? Related Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nominees... \nFor a mere $150,000, you and a companion can join actor Keanu Reeves in California for a two-day motorcycle ride along the Pacific Coast and through the Santa Monica Mountains. \nYou'll share meals together, talk motorcycle design -- or maybe Zen Buddhism, or Sandra Bullock -- and cap the trip with a nice parting gift: a custom-built KRGT-1 bike from the Arch Motorcycle Company, which Reeves co-owns. \nIt's just one of the over-the-top \"fantasy gifts\" being offered by high-end retailer Neiman Marcus in their annual Christmas Book, a holiday gift catalog for people who already have everything. \nIf biking with Keanu isn't your thing, you could spring for a luxury trip to space ($90,000), a collection of rare craft bourbons ($125,000), Lyle Lovett's handmade guitar ($30,000) or a dream trip across India ($400,000). \nThey're all just a little more exciting than that gift card from Banana Republic. \nSure, these gifts are pricey, but you can sink into profound debt knowing that a percentage of your purchase will benefit the Heart of Neiman Marcus Foundation, which supports arts education for children. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource .
