Stine in the movie opening Oct.16, opens up about becoming addicted to cocaine at the young age of 14, four years after his parents divorced. \n\"I remember just lots of turmoil from that time period,\" said Black, 46. \"I was having a lot of troubles with cocaine...I was hanging out with some pretty rough characters. I was scared to go to school (because) one of them wanted to kill me. I wanted to get out of there.\" \nHis parents enrolled him in Poseidon, a school for troubled youths, and it was there Black met a therapist who helped him chart a new course. \n\"I spilled my guts, telling him I felt guilty about stealing from my mom to get money for cocaine,\" said Black. \"I cried like a baby. It was a huge release and a huge relief. I left feeling euphoric, like an enormous weight had been lifted from me. It changed me.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:04:59.345+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
