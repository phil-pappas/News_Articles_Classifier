With TransTunnel layers users have full control over shape rotation, size, and images creating endless possibilities. TransTunnel offers more than 30 shape effect presets including custom shapes.\nTransTunnel Layers brings the tunnel transition back with another unique style. Final Cut Pro X users can now transition from one screen to the next with a clean, shape, slide show.\nEditors can use the custom shape preset to create a tunnel path. From unique geometric shapes to company logos, users can travel through any tunnel to move from scene to scene in a project.\nTransTunnel Layers allows users to add a logo or text to the end of the tunnel, which will fade out as the user exits the tunnel and enters the next scene. This feature allows users to make unique title sequences and presentations with this effect.\nDesigned for Final Cut Pro X, users can simply drag and drop the transition between two of the film's clips, and then adjust the images . Editors can instantly give the film the style it needs with just a few clicks of a mouse.\nEstablished in 2006, Aliso Viejo, California-based Pixel Film Studios is an innovative developer of visual effects tools for the post-production and broadcast community.
