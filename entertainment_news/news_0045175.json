The new Lehigh Valley Cider and Wine Festival is Oct. 24. (DONNA FISHER / THE MORNING CALL) Jennifer Sheehan Contact Reporter Of The Morning Call The fest — which sold out of tickets on Monday — will feature hard cider and wine tastings. \nFranklin Hill Vineyards, one of the Valley's oldest wineries, is known for its award-winning wines. But did you know it also makes a top-notch hard cider, too? \nThe Bangor winery will show off that cider along with its wines at the first Lehigh Valley Cider and Wine Festival Saturday, Oct. 24 at Allentown's Coca-Cola Park. \nThe fest — which sold out its 2,500 general admission and VIP tickets on Monday — will feature hard cider and wine tastings from local and regional cideries and eight of the members of the Lehigh Valley Wine Trail. \n\"It's a unique event,\" says Jon Schaeffer, spokesman for the Lehigh Valley Iron Pigs. \"There's not a lot of events that feature cider and wine.\" \nHard cider in particular is enjoying meteoric success across the country, appealing to those thirsty for something different. \n\"Cider is so hot right now,\" says Elaine Pivinski, owner of Franklin Hill Vineyard. \nFranklin Hill's hard cider is a blend of five types of apples and is lightly carbonated. The cider, one of its newest products, is made from apples grown at a nearby orchard. \nRowan Asher Winery & Cidery of Stroudsburg will serve two of its hard ciders: \"Indian Head,\" a slightly sweet dry cider infused with its estate and organicallygrown chamomile, and \"Sweet Gypsy,\" a sweet cranberry hard cider infused with organic hibiscus. \nFrecon's Cidery of Boyertown, Berks County, will feature four ciders: Brix, its newest cider that's crisp and a bit sweeter; Hoppy Mon, which is light, dry, a little fruity and dry hopped; its popular Crabby Granny, a strong cider blended with crab apples, Granny Smith and winesap apples, then balanced with sweet and aromatic apples, with tartness up front and wildflower and clover honey to provide a smooth finish; and its Apfelwein, from its estate series, which is slightly off-dry and served still. \nThere also will be more than a dozen other well-known cideries on hand including: Stella Artois Cidre, Johnny Appleseed, Angry Orchard and Strongbow Hard Apple Ciders. \nWineries also will offer tastings, as well as sales by the glass, bottle and case. The festival coincides with Pennsylvania Wine Month. \nFranklin Hill will also feature its new \"Potion X,\" a pumpkin spice wine. \n\"A year ago we thought about this,\" Pivinski says. \"We thought 'What do people like?' and the hottest thing is pumpkin spice. So we took our vidal blanc and put our magic wand on it. It's an incredible wine.\" \nClover Hill Winery of Breinigsville will have samples of its spiced apple and holiday wines, which are served warm. \n\"We make them year-round but this is the time of year where people love them,\" says Kari Skrip Gavenus. \nAlso participating are Amore Vineyards & Winery of Nazareth; Blue Mountain Vineyards of New Tripoli; Galen Glen Vineyard & Winery of Andreas; Tolino Vineyards of Bangor; and Vynecrest Winery of Breinigsville. \nThe festival also features discussions on how cider and wine are made, including a panel on wine-making led by Pivinski, Galen Troxell of Galen Glen and Sam Landis of Vynecrest. \nTim Harakal will perform acoustic music, and alternative folk-rock band Harkland will play. \nFestival-goers will also be able to test their skills slinging apples at a field. \nVendors will serve autumnal eats, such as BOB-B-Q Sliders and Sides Truck of Allentown, with offerings that include pulled pork sliders topped with a homemade green apple slaw, and Trixie's Treats of Allentown, which will have gourmet cupcakes, brownies and treats featuring fall flavors such as pumpkin, pecan and apple, as well as caramel apple cheesecake, pecan pie bread pudding and pumpkin roll. \nTicket-holders also can check out artisan and craft vendors such as Lauren's Lotions and Potions, Touchstone Crystal by Swarovski and Two Winey Sisters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T05:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:06:46.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
