He is seen in flashbacks through Adele's point of view.\n\"It's the 'connect with memory,' the 'walk down memory lane,'\" says Dolan. \"We would cut from Adele in the present to this guy looking at her and not have a younger version of Adele so that watching it, you would feel like her looking back.\"\n\"When I heard the song I saw a story right away, just this idea of taking the phone and calling your past,\" he recalls.", "external_links": ["http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6737541/adele-25-album-release", "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6738238/adele-best-singles-ranked", "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6738361/adele-hello-music-video-director-xavier-dolan"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T21:40:36.369+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
