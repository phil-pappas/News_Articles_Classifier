Critics have long speculated over the paternity of the kids, and their 13-year-old sibling Prince Michael Jackson II, who was born to a mystery surrogate, but Michael maintained he had fathered all three of his offspring - even though they shared no similar facial features. \nThe gossip has continued to swirl following Michael's 2009 death, and now his eldest son has addressed the reports for the first time. \nThe 18-year old was prompted to speak out after one Twitter user cruelly insisted his mother's former boss, dermatologist Dr. Arnold Klein, was his real dad. \n\"everyone knows you are a Rowe-Klein NOT A Jackson!!\", the Twitter troll wrote. \"Yall (sic) should stop trying to put on a FAKE front and get real.\" \nPrince chose to take the high road and refused to get angry at the social media outburst, and instead responded with a comment suggesting he is well aware Michael may not be his biological dad. \n\"The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb...,\" he tweeted. \"I was raised by my dad with my brother and sister.\" \"The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb\" I was raised by my dad with my brother and sister. https://t.co/0Ofs2vrnZs â€” Prince Jackson (@princemjjjaxon) October 6, 2015 \nArnold Klein has previously fuelled rumours alleging he fathered Prince by comparing an old driving licence photo of himself to an image of the teen in 2013. \nPrince and his siblings are currently being raised by their cousin, TJ Jackson, and their grandmother Katherine. \nTJ, whose father is Tito Jackson, recently admitted he felt it was his duty to take care of the youngsters following his Uncle Michael's death in a bid to pay back the pop star for doing so much for him and his brothers when they were kids. \n\"Being guardian to my uncle Michael's kids takes a lot of time, and it's something that I put a lot of effort into and take a lot of pride in,\" TJ told Entertainment Tonight. \"For me, I just want to do well for my uncle, and he was such an important person for me when I lost my mother as a 16 year old that I'm just trying to repay him.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T22:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:16:13.980+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
