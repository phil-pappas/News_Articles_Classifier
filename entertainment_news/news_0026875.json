NBA star Stephen Curry and other members of the Golden State Warriors warmed up the San Francisco crowd. Those attending the Democratic National Committee fundraiser paid between $250 and $10,000.

Why are so many Republican politicians so down on America? Why are they so grumpy?\" Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, right, greets basketball player Stephen Curry, center, and his teammates from the 2015 NBA Champion Golden State Warriors on stage during a democratic fundraiser at the Warfield Theater, Saturday, Oct. 10, 2015 in San Francisco.

Abrams. He then went to a fundraiser for the DNC where about 200 supporters contributed up $33,400. Jamie Foxx and his band performed before Obama spoke.

He noted that he went to Oregon the day before to visit with families of those killed at the community college. Two more college shootings occurred on the same day. While some protested during his visit, Obama said he felt just as strongly that such shootings are not inevitable and that the public should encourage lawmakers to take on the gun issue. \nAt times on Saturday Obama referenced the GOP's struggles to find a replacement for House Speaker John Boehner. He said during his final Los Angeles fundraiser, which supporters paid up to $33,400 to attend, that even deeply conservative lawmakers are not considered ideologically pure enough. \n\"At this moment in history, the choices are stark and facts, evidence and values are on our side,\" he side. \"And the other side has gone off the deep end.\" President Barack Obama walks on stage to speak at a Democratic fundraiser at the Warfield Theater, Saturday, Oct. 10, 2015 in San Francisco.
