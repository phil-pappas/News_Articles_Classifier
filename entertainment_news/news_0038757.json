Crepp mcrepp@ellwoodcityledger.com   \nNORTH SEWICKLEY TWP. – North Sewickley Township supervisors approved a tentative 2016 budget that holds the line on taxes, during Tuesday’s supervisors’ meeting. \nSupervisors Emmett Santillo, chairman, Linda Brown and John Axtell approved the advertising of the tentative spending plan that keeps property taxes at 8 mills. The budget includes general fund revenues of $1,206,850 and expenditures of $1,203,505. \nReal estate taxes for a property assessed at $50,000 would be about $400. \nGeneral fund items include expenditures of $367,150 for general government, $367,955 for public safety, $5,000 for animal control, $394,550 for public works, $8,000 for recreation and $60,850 for miscellaneous items and insurance. \nIncluded in the budget is a sewer authority debt guarantee that includes revenues and expenditures of $465,494 each. \nThere are also five special funds — street lights, fire protection, fire hydrant, fire station and state liquid fuels fund. \nThe street light fund includes expenditures of $11,000 with revenues totaling $11,515. This tax was revised earlier this year from $48 per parcel for those residing within 250 feet of a street light to about $4 for every parcel holder. Prior to the change, 259 parcel holders paid the tax while other taxpayers were not accessed any street light tax. Under the taxing structure, all 3,208 taxable parcels in the township share the tax. \nThere is also a 1-mill property fire protection tax assessed with the funds going to the township’s volunteer fire department. This fund has expenditures and revenues of $57,050. This tax also remained the same as in 2015. \nThe fire hydrant fund includes a separate tax of .25 mills, which remains the same as in 2015, with expenditures of $26,100 and revenues of $11,530. There is a balance of about $30,000 for this fund. \nThe fire station fund, for the station on Brighton Road has expenditures listed at $0 with revenues listed at $15. \nThe state liquid fuels fund has revenues and expenditures of $208,576.57, an increase of about $30,000 over 2015, said Amy Schmidhamer, township secretary. \nTotals for the special funds are $288,687 in revenues and $302,707 in expenses. The grand totals for all funds are 1,961,030 in revenues and $1,971,705 in expenditures. \nThe budget will be advertised and placed on public display for 20 days. It will likely be adopted during the supervisors’ meeting on Nov. 10.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:29:08.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
