He's also co-starring with Naomi Watts in another movie, the upcoming thriller Shut In, due next year.\nBased on Emma Donoghue's bestselling novel, Room stars Brie Larson as a kidnapping victim and Tremblay as her five-year-old son, the child of her abductor. Their captive lives are lived in a tiny garden shed where Larson's character has created a whole world for her son; the movie is part thriller, part homage to maternal love.\nRoom won the People's Choice audience award at the Toronto International Film Festival this year; that award is considered an excellent predictor of Oscar success. Both Larson and Tremblay are likely to get acting nominations, and if Tremblay gets a nod in the Best Actor category, he'll be nudging up against a record for youngest-ever nominee that's been on the books for 84 years — tying nine-year-old Jackie Cooper's nomination for the 1931 movie, Skippy.\nTremblay, who was in Toronto during TIFF, has heard the chat about how he might be an Oscar contender for Room, and he's fine with all that, provided no speeches are required.\n\"But I write speeches sometimes,\" he adds, \"So I might be really good at it.\"\nTremblay says the itchy long wig he wore for Room was the toughest part of his job.\nThe best part?\n\"I like craft services.\"\nHe says he never gets bored on movie sets because he has a tablet. He likes going to the movies and playing with Lego.\nTremblay says he has two sisters — one older, one younger — and zero brothers. Both his sisters are also actors.\nAsked if he intends to be an actor when he's an adult, Tremblay says, \"Yup.\"\nThen he adds, \"But if I don't get the chance I'm going to be a Jedi.\"\nWho would he fight for?\n\"Canada.\" (Tremblay is from Vancouver)\nThe young actor patiently explains that his Book of Henry director, Jurassic World’s Colin Trevorrow, will direct Star Wars: Episode IX, due for release in 2019.\nIs it possible Trevorrow might find him a Jedi role?\n\"It's possible. It's really, really possible. It's extremely possible.\"\nTremblay has lovely manners. We tell him we intend to write that about him.\nWhat else should we write about him?\n\"I'm awesome. And I'm very much like a Jedi. And I should have a lightsaber.\"\nTwitter: @LizBraunSun\nliz.braun@sunmedia.ca\nAbout the author Liz Braun Other Stories How Brie Larson created magic for her performance in 'Room'\nIf you're like most moviegoers, Brie Larson probably snuck up on you while you weren't looking.\n0\n'Freeheld' review: Ellen Page and Julianne Moore can't save emotionless drama\nWhen New Jersey detective Laurel Hester discovered she had lung cancer in 2004, she asked that her partner, Stacie Andree, receive her police pension benefits.\n0\nSee more from Liz Braun »\nTop Movies 'Room' star Jacob Tremblay has sights set on 'Star Wars' 0\n'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' full trailer: Our 5 favourite moments 0\nHow Brie Larson created magic for her performance in 'Room' 0\nCanada's first 3D horror gets ready to scare a whole new generation 0\nCharlize Theron almost starred in 'Showgirls' ", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228633661&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB"], "published": "2015-10-20T23:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:30:04.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
