Smoke flares were released as activists temporarily halted the opening night of the London Film Festival. Meryl Streep and Carey Mulligan were among the stars who attended. Mulligan backed the protest. The film co-stars Helena Bonham Carter and Anne-Marie Duff who also supported the activists. The film is set in 1912-13, and shows how the women in the suffrage movement attacked property and bombed post boxes to make their voices heard. The film was the first commercial movie to be allowed to film in the Houses of Parliament. Helen Pankhurst, the great grand-daughter of suffragette Emmeline, and Laura Pankhurst - Emmeline's great great grand-daughter also attended the gala screening. 'Suffragette' opens in the UK on October 12, and in the US on October 23.  //reut.rs/1ZdTkgl", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T02:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:03:08.889+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
