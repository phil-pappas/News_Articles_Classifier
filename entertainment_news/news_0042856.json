Benett/WireImage 1. It's Mr Christian Grey himself - Jamie Dornan. And he isn't keen on Strictly:Jamie Dornan and Nick Frost on a couch together.

Dornan was paired with Nick Frost, prompting some concern for Frost's usual comedy partner Simon Pegg:Cats are up to something, clearly, but Jamie Dornan is on to them...

One particular scene shown to the Goggleboxers led to much hilarity on Twitter, when a gazelle in Patagonia was shown giving birth. Apparently, picking where you go into labour might be a bit of a payoff:\"If your waters break in Marks and Spencer you get a voucher. I went there a lot when I was pregnant.\" Brilliant. #Gogglebox— Russell Truran (@russelltruran) October 9, 2015 If she'd dropped that in M and S she'd have got a voucher ! #Gogglebox— Pam Snowball (@PamSnowball) October 9, 2015 If only the Patagonian guanaco was shopping in M&S when giving birth if only! #voucher #Gogglebox— Breda Patterson (@breeds77) October 9, 2015 6. The poor gazelle had barely given birth before she was chased around the plain by males looking to mate already, with Dornan providing his own commentary:Jamie Dornan, the new David Attenborough 'Something bad's going to happen here!' #Gogglebox— Catherine Donaldson (@catherine_dxx) October 9, 2015 7. Nick Frost didn't exactly mince his words either, when the gazelle was finally tracked down:'yeah pussy' nick frost #Gogglebox— laurab (@laurajbarr1981) October 9, 2015 Nick Frost .. \"Yeah Pussy!\" .. #Gogglebox— Nelly (@Nellworth) October 9, 2015 8.
