The original listing price was $19.5 million. \nSwan did say the buyer was “local” and had ties to New Mexico. \nFonda bought the ranch in 2000 and spent two years scouting the property in search of the perfect location to build a new 9,600-square-foot home. It was featured in the March 2014 issue of Architectural Digest. \nAt the time it was listed, Fonda said in a statement that the ranch had been a sanctuary and a place of joy and recreation for her and her family. Due to changes in her life, she said she was no longer able to spend as much time at the ranch and felt it was time to pass it on to a new owner. \nAssociated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:51:47.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
