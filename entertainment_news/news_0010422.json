Pic/Santa Banta \nThe \"Highway\" actress says TV requires a \"lot of body of work\".\n\"For me to do a TV show you need a lot of body of work. Like for Amit ji (Amitabh Bachchan), he is a superstar, who can hold that together. For me, I need many more years in the Indian film industry to hold a TV show together,\" Alia, who has appeared on TV mostly for film promotions, told IANS.\n\"You need a big body of work to hold a TV show on your shoulders. Its not in terms of shooting length. It's for you to be well known and well appreciated by fans so that you can hold a TV show,\" added the 22-year-old, who stars alongside Shahid Kapoor in filmmaker Vikas Bahl's romantic comedy \"Shaandaar\", which released on Thursday on the occasion of Dussehra.\nApparently, Alia signed \"Shaandaar\" much before she did \"Highway\" and Bahl came into limelight with Kangana Ranaut starrer \"Queen\".\nAsked what urged her to take up this film, Alia explained: \"What I really liked about the concept is that Vikas came to me with only five lines. He said that it's a love story of two insomniacs, there is a destination wedding, there are some four characters that seem completely crazy to me.\n\"The world that he was describing turned out very fairytale type where there were castles, horses, stars and dragonflies. I felt that the world was unique. The story was entertaining, fun and sweet. Also there was this father-daughter relationship between Pankaj (Kapur) sir and me, which I found very interesting,\" she added.\nAlia also described \"Shaandaar\" as the \"first time destination wedding film\" in India.\n\"We all are very well aware that 'shaadi' (wedding) films do really well in our Indian film industry. 'Shaadi' is such an important moment for all of us in our lives. We really go all out to celebrate a wedding.\n\"Destination wedding people have not really touched upon. There is always 'shaadi', but not like the one we are showing in the film, where all of us go to a destination and live under one roof. This is something that Vikas has touched upon for the first time,\" she added.\nAsked whether she would be marrying someone from the film fraternity or would like to tie the knot to someone from a non filmy background just like Shahid, Alia, who earlier regarded 31 as the right for marriage, said: \"I think time will tell. I can't predict the future at this moment\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:56:28.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
