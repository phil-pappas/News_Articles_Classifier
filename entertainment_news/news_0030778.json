The plant, hydrilla verticillata , has been the focus of prolonged and expensive control efforts in southern Cayuga Lake near Ithaca and a stretch of the Erie Canal in Niagara and Erie counties.\nHydrilla is one of the most-feared invasive species in the country because it grows fast and spreads easily and can become so thick it chokes out other forms of life in a lake or a stream. It has done this numerous places in Florida and other southern states where it is much more widespread.\nUnexpectedly, hydrilla has now turned up in the pond in Tinker Nature Park on Calkins Road — spotted and identified a few days ago by Hilary Mosher, who is coordinator of the Finger Lakes Partnership for Regional Invasive Species Management .\n\"I live right down the road from there,\" said Mosher, who announced the discovery in a news release Wednesday. \"Ironically, I was there with my son, went to the pond and saw a plant that seemed to be a bit too much like what we’re on the lookout for.\"\nMosher grabbed a sample, took it to a member of the hydrilla task force at Cayuga Lake , and got confirmation Monday that the green aquatic herb she'd found was indeed hydrilla.\nThe state Department of Environmental Conservation was alerted Tuesday, as was the town of Henrietta, which owns the 68-acre park. DEC officials are scheduled to visit the nature park Thursday to gather more samples, assess the extent of infestation and consider how to deal with it.\n'We're currently developing a rapid response plan,\" Mosher said. Control options could include use of chemical herbicides, mechanical dredging or removal by hand, she said.\nAny attempt to get rid of hydrilla must be undertaken carefully. \"It fragments. If you break it in two, you have two plants. If you break in four pieces, you have four plants. If you try to remove it and you don’t get every possible part of the plant, you’re just spreading it more,\" Mosher said.\nHydrilla is harmless to people, but she advised anyone visiting the site to be careful around the pond and make sure they don't accidentally carry off any plant fragments.\nThe Henrietta pond is connected to a small wetlands and a stream into which the hydrilla could spread. Less likely but more troubling is the possibility that birds or people could carry fragments of hydrilla to larger water bodies nearby such as the Erie Canal or the ponds at Mendon Ponds Park, she said.\nHow hydrilla got into the pond isn't entirely clear. At an acre or so in size, the pond probably is too small for someone to bother carrying in a canoe or kayak and accidentally bringing a slice of hydrilla along for the ride.\n\"It's far enough away from the other infestations in New York state that we really are at a loss as to the exact method of introduction,\" Mosher said.\nOne guess, she said, is someone emptying an old aquarium into the pond. Hydrilla, native to parts of Asia, Africa and Australia, was initially brought to this country as ornamentation for fresh-water aquariums, and \"aquarium dumps\" are known to have released the plant to the wild in other states.\nIn addition to Cayuga Lake and the western end of the Erie Canal, hydrilla has been found in New York state in a pond on private land in Broome County, in eight small lakes and ponds in Orange, Westchester and Suffolk counties, and in the Croton River where it flows into the Hudson River in Westchester.\nClose-up of hydrilla found in a pond at Tinker Nature Park in Henrietta.
