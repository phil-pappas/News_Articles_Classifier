October’s theme is Murder a la Agatha Christie. \nThe Oct. 9 film is “Murder At The Gallop” (1963, UK), a nonrated film that runs 81 minutes. When an antisocial villager unexpectedly drops dead, most assume he suffered a heart attack — everyone, that is, except Miss Marple (Margaret Rutherford). By scrutinizing each of the people who could have benefited from the victim's passing, she follows her instincts to reopen what seemed to be an open-and-shut case. Robert Morley and Flora Robson co-star in this adaptation of Agatha Christie’s “After the Funeral.” \nUpcoming in this month’s series are: Oct. 23, “Murder Most Foul” (1964, UK); and Oct. 30, “And Then There Were None” (1945, USA). Friday Night Films are open to the public free of charge, although donations are gratefully accepted. Light refreshments will be served. For more information, call the library at 354-2453. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
