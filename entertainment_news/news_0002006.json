The announcement that she would not be travelling to the United Kingdom or Canada came via her official website. \nHer message said: “I am truly sorry that I have to cancel the remainder of my tour dates. \nI was so looking forward to sharing this tour with all my amazing fans in Canada and the UK. Unfortunately my doctor is telling me I have to stay on vocal rest, but I am working hard to get better as fast as possible.” So bummed that I have to cancel some of my tour dates.
