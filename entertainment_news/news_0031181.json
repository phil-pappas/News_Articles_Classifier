PHOTO COURTESY SANDRA REZAC Related article » Saying good-bye What: A memorial service for retired Riverside County firefighter Barry Rezac.\nWhen: Wednesday, Oct. 28 at 11 a.m.\nWhere: Sunset Hills Memorial Park and Mortuary, 24000 Waalew Road, Apple Valley\nBarry Rezac, whose exploits as a Cal Fire/Riverside County firefighter earned him the nickname “Nine Lives Rezac,” has died.\nRezac, 57, died Sept. 27 at St. Mary Medical Center in Apple Valley of end-stage renal disease and cardiopulmonary arrest, said his wife Sandra Rezac.\nRezac underwent a double-lung transplant in 2008 after developing pulmonary fibrosis which causes scarring of the lungs. Doctors said he developed the illness while on the job.\nHe retired in 2009.\nEven as his health began to fail, Sandra Rezac said her husband never lost his passion for firefighting and saving lives.\n“We would see fire trucks going down the street and his eyes would light up,” Sandra Rezac said. “It was his life.”\nDuring his nearly 30-year career as a firefighter, Rezac earned numerous awards and accolades for his heroic acts.\nPerhaps the best known incident, which took place December 1997, Rezac acted as a human shield, stepping between two Rottweilers charging a family with children, beating the dogs back with his fists.\nThe incident brought him commendations from the Riverside County Board of Supervisors, the Rubidoux Community Services District and the Jurupa Rotary Club. He was also named Firefighter of the year by the Jurupa Valley Chamber of Commerce.\nDuring his career, he also fell 100-feet down a hillside while fighting a brush fire, had porches collapse on him and suffered serious burns when an oxygen tank exploded while he was preparing to enter a burning home to save the occupant.\nHe also delivered 11 babies, Sandra Rezac said.\nDavid Rollins, who worked with Rezac at Station 38 in the Rubidoux area of what is now Jurupa Valley, said Rezac possessed all the traits of a top-notch firefighter: respect for co-workers, aggressiveness on the fire lines and a willingness to do things other people won’t do.\n“He always wanted to be in the action. He didn’t want to be a supervisor,” said Phil Kallenberger, who was Rezac’s supervisor at Station 38 for years.\nBarry Rezac was born in Little Rock, Arkansas and grew up in Riverside. He graduated from Norte Vista High School in 1980 and then joined what was then the Rubidoux Community Services District Fire Department. The department became part of the Cal Fire/Riverside County Fire Department in 1990.\nRezac was an avid horseman. He and his wife lived in Norco for years. In 2012 the couple moved to Apple Valley. Rezac is survived by his wife, mother Sydney Sutton Smith; son Joshua Rezac, daughter Jennifer Rezac; stepdaughter Rachel De Lorto; sister Gina Marie Rezac; brother Allan Rezac and 11 grandchildren.\nContact the writer: 951-368-9647 or sstokley@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwldu0-b88544424z.120151021154250000gpccn6h8.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwldu0-b88544424z.120151021154250000gpccn6h8.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:15:38.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
