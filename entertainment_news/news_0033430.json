According to CNN News , Oct. 15, 2015, Lamar’s condition is still critical, he is in a coma and on a ventilator. The Reverend Jesse Jackson also reported that he was on life support. So far, no news has been verified from hospital staff, only by sources and people who have visited the NBA star. However, it is not looking good as he remains unconscious and his organs are failing.\nTJ Moore, the manager of the \"Love Shack\" in Crystal, told NBC News that Lamar wanted a ride from his friend's house to the brothel and was the one to drive him. She and Lamar chatted during the 90-minute drive and he even admired the scenery as they traveled. Apparently, she didn’t notice anything unusual in his behavior except he wanted to get away and \"He didn't indicate what he wanted to get away from but was adamant he wanted no phone calls, don't acknowledge he was here, wanted rest and relaxation.\" TJ was also there in the attempt to revive Lamar as she turned him on his side and cleared his mouth. It was then that she noticed a white substance with tinges of blood coming from his mouth and nose.\nTMZ reports that Richard Hunter spoke to the 911 operator and reported that on Saturday, Lamar had cocaine on him and he had taken 10 doses of an herbal Viagra, a supplement for male enhancement. Doctors have confirmed that cocaine was in Lamar's system and he may be charged with drug possession. There are also reports of other drugs in Lamar's system. They are doing a blood test on him, but the results can take several weeks before they know what, for sure, Lamar had been taking.\nAccording to USA Today , the herbal supplements Lamar took were, “Reload; 72-hour strong; sexual performance enhancer for men.” However, there is a dark side to the herbal drugs because they aren’t totally herbal. Often times they have other powerful pharmaceuticals, which are not listed, as part of the ingredients. The package apparently said they are made in the USA, but when investigators looked on the website given on the package, it was for a Japanese date site. Tests were performed on this drug and it was discovered that it contains sildenafil, which is the powerful drug found in the prescription Viagra. It can be dangerous if taken with nitrates or certain other drugs.", "external_links": ["http://www.news3lv.com/content/news/story/former-NBA-star-Lamar-Odom-brothel-moore/IFGmQI7FKUCk8Cvda5ZAqA.cspx", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/10/15/lamar-odom-sexual-enhancement-supplement-viagra/73981664/", "http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/15/us/lamar-odom-condition/", "http://www.tmz.com/2015/10/14/lamar-odom-911-call/"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:27:51.192+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
