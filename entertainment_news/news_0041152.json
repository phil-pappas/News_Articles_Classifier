French media, citing the unions, on Monday reported a proposal to slash 2,900 jobs. De Juniac said the company was being squeezed by low-cost airlines in Europe and Gulf carriers for long-haul flights. Today’s meeting was intended to detail the cuts, which he told Europe 1 radio would be “significant.” \nAmong those at today’s protest was Yves Porte, an activist who represents cargo workers. ”At a certain moment, the Gulf companies, who have low fuel prices and who receive government subsidies, compete with us. It’s impossible, we are not on a level playing field,” he said. Air France said it would file a complaint for aggravated assault. \nAlthough today’s scuffle was unusually violent, labor relations in France are commonly testy, with unions sometimes even resorting to holding managers hostage – or “boss-napping”– to make a point. France’s transport secretary, Alain Vidalies, condemned the violence, saying in a tweet it was “unacceptable and must be punished.” \n  7:59 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T17:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:20:35.411+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
