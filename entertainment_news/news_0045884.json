That women without any skills that freeload are being glorified.\" \n\"That’s something I was raised not to be. That you’re supposed to contribute to the world, not consume from it.” Next for Rousey is a film adaptation of her autobiography My Fight Your Fight , which she will also star in, as well as taking the lead in the upcoming remake of Roundhouse .
