It also packed a lot of social justice subtext into a plot that's mostly centered on a prestigious New York girls' boarding school. And on that note, in 20 years, the actresses playing all those little rich girls have grown up! See them all here, as well as some of the film's other best characters. People age!\nMore From Cosmopolitan 1. Sara Crewe, played by Liesel Pritzker Simmons Share Tweet Pin E-mail Acting under her stage name Liesel Matthews, Pritzker Simmons played both the heroine here and in the Harrison Ford presidential disaster flick Air Force One . (She was feisty for a kid in the midst of a plane-hijacking movie.) Aside from these credits, her only other role was in the 2000 film Blast , per IMDB.\nOutside of Hollywood, Pritzker Simmons is an heir to the Hyatt Hotels family fortune estimated by The New York Times in 2002 at $15 billion — that year, she and her brother sued her family over her trust funds and other monies following her father's death. She received a $500 million payout from her suit, and per a 2013 Forbes magazine profile , \"left [the United States] to find herself.\"\nSpecifically, she went to India, like Sara. There, she undertook volunteer work in a nursery school and as a yoga teacher in a program designed to rehabilitate heroin addicts. (She also volunteered in Ghana and Tanzania while on her travels.) She has since spearheaded philanthropic projects, funneling millions into nonprofits focused on education and clean water initiatives across the developing world. Pictured above, Pritzker Simmons in conversation with Forbes about her work.\nHer husband, Ian Simmons, is also from an uber-wealthy family, an heir to a department store and canal lock-derived fortune.\n2. Laki, played by Rahi Azizi Share Tweet Pin E-mail As well as Sara's BFF (before Becky), Rahi Azizi starred in a few '90s TV shows and had a minor role in Deep Impact . He's pictured above in a semi-recent Facebook photo — these days he is an attorney in Los Angeles focused on media litigation and labor laws.\n3. Becky, played by Vanessa Lee Chester Share Tweet Pin E-mail Barry King / Getty Images (NOW photo) Vanessa Lee Chester has worked steadily since her role in A Little Princess , but hopefully not so hard that she's left icing her blisters at the end of a day's work like poor Becky.\nGIF Share Tweet Pin E-mail ", "external_links": ["http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1280x588/gallery-1443551574-little-princess-movie-screencapscom-210.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/rahi.azizi", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/480x220/gallery-1443551701-little-princess-movie-screencapscom-8612.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/640x960/gallery-1443541715-a-little-princess-poster.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/980x450/gallery-1443551701-little-princess-movie-screencapscom-8612.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/480x262/placeholder_gallery-1443634368-anigif-enhanced-buzz-30008-1388792097-22.gif", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/640x320/landscape-1443551574-little-princess-movie-screencapscom-210.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1600x735/gallery-1443551574-little-princess-movie-screencapscom-210.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/768x353/gallery-1443551574-little-princess-movie-screencapscom-210.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1443541715-a-little-princess-poster.jpg", "http://www.forbes.com/sites/erincarlyle/2013/11/17/liesel-pritzker-simmons-sued-her-family-and-got-500-million-but-shes-no-trust-fund-baby/", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/480x262/gallery-1443634368-anigif-enhanced-buzz-30008-1388792097-22.gif", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/768x353/gallery-1443551701-little-princess-movie-screencapscom-8612.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/980x450/gallery-1443550984-little-princess-movie-screencapscom-3524.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/480x220/gallery-1443550984-little-princess-movie-screencapscom-3524.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1600x735/gallery-1443551701-little-princess-movie-screencapscom-8612.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/640x320/landscape-1443551701-little-princess-movie-screencapscom-8612.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/980x1470/gallery-1443541715-a-little-princess-poster.jpg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlDOzpKlR1A", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/768x353/gallery-1443550984-little-princess-movie-screencapscom-3524.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1280x588/gallery-1443551701-little-princess-movie-screencapscom-8612.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/640x294/gallery-1443551701-little-princess-movie-screencapscom-8612.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/768x1152/gallery-1443541715-a-little-princess-poster.jpg", "http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/11/us/knives-drawn-for-a-15-billion-family-pie.html?pagewanted=all", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/980x450/gallery-1443551574-little-princess-movie-screencapscom-210.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1280x588/gallery-1443550984-little-princess-movie-screencapscom-3524.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1443634368-anigif-enhanced-buzz-30008-1388792097-22.gif", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/640x294/gallery-1443550984-little-princess-movie-screencapscom-3524.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/480x720/gallery-1443541715-a-little-princess-poster.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/placeholder_1443634368-anigif-enhanced-buzz-30008-1388792097-22.gif", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1600x735/gallery-1443550984-little-princess-movie-screencapscom-3524.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/640x320/landscape-1443550984-little-princess-movie-screencapscom-3524.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/640x320/landscape-1443541715-a-little-princess-poster.jpg", "http://www.avvo.com/attorneys/90071-ca-rahi-azizi-3737980.html", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/640x294/gallery-1443551574-little-princess-movie-screencapscom-210.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/480x220/gallery-1443551574-little-princess-movie-screencapscom-210.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-30T23:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:03:24.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
