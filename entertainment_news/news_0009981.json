The film tentatively titled Sila Nerangalil was shot in just 16 days. Produced by Amala Paul, the film also has Prakash Raj and Sriya Reddy in the lead.\nWhen contacted Ashok Selvan, says, \"The film was completed in just 16 days as everything was well organised. Working with Priyadarshan sir and Prakash Raj sir is more like a dream come true and I am not sure whether this will happen again in my film career. I am playing the role of Balamurugan — a common man, who encounters a difficult situation in life. My role can be easily related to the larger section of people in the society. The film is on the lines of Priyadarshan's previous film Kanchivaram — and the story is based on AIDS awareness.\" He adds, \"We shot the entire film in a hospital set that was erected in the city. I have a lot of combination scenes with Prakash Raj sir in the film.\"\nAshok recalls, \"After the last shot, I had a good conversation with Prakash Raj sir inside the caravan. He spoke to me about how he prepared for the role, and the efforts he took for it. I had goosebumps when I listened to it. I felt proud that there are actors in our industry who can go to any extent for their role. I can't forget those moments in my life.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:18:18.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
