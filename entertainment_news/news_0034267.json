In addition to customer donations in select stores, this marks the campaign's first fall season in-store fundraiser involving donations generated by purchase of participating products active in more than 2,200 stores across 33 states.  Over $12 million has been raised for programs connecting hungry children to healthy food since the campaign's inception just two years ago. According to the USDA, one in five children in America struggle with hunger. This national campaign encourages individuals and communities to get involved in solving this widespread problem that too often goes unnoticed.\nHunger Is continues to be supported by award-winning actress and ambassador Viola Davis , who has shared her personal story about growing up hungry not only publicly, but in the initiative's public service announcements that appear both in-store and across tv, radio, print, online and out-of-home media outlets.\n\"I am overjoyed that this campaign continues to strike a chord with communities across the country. This is only further proof of our need to fix this incomprehensible problem that affects too many children,\" Davis expressed. She went on to say, \"I am exceedingly grateful to the thousands of supporters that are helping us every day to bring light to this issue. I will continue to look forward to a day when this conversation shifts to a dialogue of the past. Until then, we will carry on with our mission to eradicate childhood hunger in America.\"\n\"We are so grateful to our generous customers for their support of Hunger Is . Without our customers, we would not be able to affect change in their own communities in the fight against childhood hunger,\" said Christy Duncan Anderson , Executive Director of the Albertson Companies Foundation. \"We are thankful to have Viola Davis continue to lend her voice to this issue and to the Entertainment Industry Foundation for their continued partnership in the mission to eradicate childhood hunger.\"\nThus far, Hunger Is has awarded grants to local charities to connect hungry children living in neighborhoods to healthy food throughout the country.  This fall, Hunger Is will be inviting regional and community-based programs in Albertsons Companies markets across the U.S. to respond to a Request for Proposals. Grants will be awarded to programs which have the potential to alleviate childhood hunger in communities throughout America.\nThe work of Hunger Is and award of grants is supported by the Hunger Is Advisory Committee comprised of leaders from the most respected hunger advocacy organizations in the U.S., including The Center for Hunger Free Communities ( Drexel University ); Feeding America® – the nation's leading domestic hunger-relief charity; Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute, the internationally renowned biomedical research institute focused on pediatric health;  the Food Research and Action Center (FRAC) – the leading national nonprofit organization working to improve public policies and public-private partnerships to eradicate hunger and malnutrition in the U.S.; Growing Power, the national nonprofit organization and land trust helping to provide equal access to healthy, high-quality, safe and affordable food for people in all communities; New York City Coalition Against Hunger which operates the national hunger hotline and sponsors the nationwide Anti-Hunger and Opportunity Corps AmeriCorps VISTA program operating in 32 states; No Kid Hungry – a campaign which connects kids in need with nutritious food and teaches their families how to cook healthy, affordable meals; and WhyHunger, supporting grassroots solutions to end hunger and poverty by connecting people to nutritious and affordable food. The committee provides guidance in defining and addressing needs and makes funding recommendations for approval by The Albertsons Companies Foundation and the EIF Board of Directors.\n\"All of us at EIF are immensely proud to be involved in this campaign with such a gracious ambassador, Viola Davis , and so grateful to the Albertsons Companies customers, whose contributions will help make a positive impact in the lives of families across the nation,\" said Lisa Paulsen , EIF President and CEO.\nMore information about the issue is available at HungerIs.org, along with simple ways for individuals to donate.
