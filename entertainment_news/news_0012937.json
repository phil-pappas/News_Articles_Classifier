What will the Bills get out of the running back position? Remember when the Bills had all those injuries at this position in training camp, and they had to quickly sign a bunch of guys you've never heard of just so they had some fresh bodies to replace injured LeSean McCoy, Karlos Williams, Fred Jackson and Boobie Dixon? Well, here we are again. McCoy is out with his lingering hamstring problem, Williams is out because of a concussion, and of course Jackson and Brown are no longer on the team. That means Dixon is slated to be the lead back, a role that he really isn't suited for, no matter what the Bills' coaching staff says. If Dixon gets off to a slow start, here's something to watch: Boom Herron, whom the Bills just signed this week, could be a factor, a point offensive coordinator Greg Roman hinted at on Thursday. Herron stepped into the Colts' lineup during the last postseason and in three games he rushed 45 times for 170 yards, and caught 20 passes for 128 yards in playoff games against Cincinnati, Denver, and New England.\n2. Can highly touted rookie Marcus Mariota survive an angry Bills defense? Buffalo's highly regarded has come under fire because it has not played to the level of expectation that was set by coach Rex Ryan. Ryan bombastically stated that his defense would be the best in the NFL this year, and it certainly has not been that. Buffalo ranks 22nd in yards, 14th in points, 27th in sacks per pass attempt, 29th in passing yards per game, and 29th in first downs allowed. After going against a gantlet of star quarterbacks including Tom Brady, Andrew Luck and Eli Manning, now the Bills get the former Heisman Trophy-winning rookie who will be starting his fourth NFL game. One would have to lean toward the Bills in this matchup.\n3. Does Greg Roman have a bounce-back game plan up his sleeve? Roman did not have a great day against the Giants. His game plan was unimaginative, and it seemed for much of the day like he was purposely holding back Tyrod Taylor and not letting him throw downfield. The Bills won’t have McCoy and Williams, and they may not have wide receiver Sammy Watkins who is questionable, so Roman has a big challenge on his hands with limited resources at his disposal. If the running game is unproductive, which is a great possibility given the state of the depth chart, Taylor is going to have to take control of this game and look to make big plays in the passing game. Charles Clay is clearly someone he trusts, but Taylor and Roman have to find a way to get Percy Harvin and Robert Woods more involved than they did last week when they combined for six catches worth 59 harmless yards.\n… and Out\nThe Bills blew a golden opportunity to finish the first quarter of their season with a 3-1 record by losing at home to the Giants last week. Sunday, they cannot afford another slip against a team they are favored to beat, and should beat, even though the game is on the road. The Titans are a young team coming off a hideous 2-14 season, which is the reason why they were able to draft Marcus Mariota second overall. Mariota is looking like a player who could become a star, but this will be just his fourth career NFL start, and his only victory to date came in Week 1 against Tampa Bay, which also went 2-14 in 2014, enabling the Bucs to draft Jameis Winston No. 1. The Bills should have a decided edge on defense, and if they can get pressure on Mariota, it could be a difficult day for the rookie who lacks dynamic offensive weapons. Mariota has been sacked 12 times, and unless he can execute a quick passing game, that total figures to rise. On offense, the Bills will need a strong game from Tyrod Taylor. One of the keys to that will be the play of the offensive line, which has to give Taylor some help, especially with Dick LeBeau calling the defensive signals for the Titans, dialing up his array of zone blitzes. MY PICK: Bills 26, Titans 16.\nNumbers …\n3 — Quarterbacks in the Super Bowl era to have multiple TD passes in the first three games of his NFL career. Tennessee's Marcus Mariota joined Jay Cutler (2006) and Mark Rypien (1988).\n71.4 — Tyrod Taylor's completion percentage, the highest after the first four games of a season in Bills history.\n255 — Yards receiving by Charles Clay, the most ever for a Bills tight end through four games.\n22 — Plays of 20 or more yards by the Buffalo offense, tied for first in the NFL with Arizona and Cincinnati.\nTalking points …\nTitans coach Ken Whisenhunt on Mariota trying to play from the pocket: \"When you get to this level, at some point you've got to stay in the pocket and win from the pocket. There's going to be times when things break down and you move out of the pocket, and certainly those will come at times, but he's done a nice job of playing the position from the pocket. It's something we've worked on, and he's done a nice job.\"\nTitans OG Chance Warmack on playing against ex-Alabama teammate Marcell Dareus : \"He's a beast, and he just got paid. He has good awareness, good strength. He taught me a lot in terms of what a defensive linemen is thinking and what they are trying to do. I used to ask him a lot of questions in college. He always had the tricks he would tell us.\"\nTitans LB Brian Orakpo on coming off the bye week : \"A lot of our big dogs on this team will be able to come back after the bye and hopefully be ready to rock and roll.\"\nBills rankings ...\nOffense\nPoints scored: 27.5 (7th)\nRun offense: 128.3 (6th)\nPass offense: 229.8 (22nd)\nTotal offense: 358.0 (13th)\n1st downs: 18.2 (T25th)\n3rd down percent: 34.5 (24th)\nDefense\nPoints allowed: 23.0 (14th)\nRun defense: 78.5 (3rd)\nPass defense: 297.8 (29th)\nTotal defense: 376.6 (22nd)\n1st downs allowed: 22.5 (29th)\n3rd down percent: 34.0 (9th)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T10:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:04:51.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
