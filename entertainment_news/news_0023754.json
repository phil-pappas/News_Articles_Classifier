Kathy Lauer-Williams Contact Reporter Of The Morning Call New tourist railroad in Kutztown offers fall foliage, Halloween rides \nFirst we climbed onto a platform at the back of the caboose. Once inside, we made use of pegs on the wall to climb up to the cupola of the caboose, a space where once only railroad crew members were permitted. \nWe sat down on seats there and, once the train lurched forward, found this second-story section afforded a great view of the passing Berks County countryside. \nThe newest tourist train in the Lehigh Valley region is Allentown and Auburn Railroad, which in March started giving passenger rides on some weekends that last 45 minutes to an hour. \nThe historic train pulled by a diesel engine plies a four-mile stretch of track between Kutztown's train station and Topton, going through fields of corn, a pumpkin patch and by pastures of grazing cows. \nThe railroad joins other tourist railroads in the region, including WK&S Railroad in nearby Kempton, Delaware River Railroad in Phillipsburg, Lehigh Gorge Scenic Railway in Jim Thorpe and Colebrookdale Railroad, which opened last year in Boyertown. \nOTHER FALL TRAIN RIDES IN THE REGION \n•Delaware Railroad \n•Where: Lehigh Station, 100 Elizabeth St., Phillipsburg \n•The Great Pumpkin Train.

It became available after the closing of a local foundry that had been using the line for freight. \nMichael Bast, a longtime train buff who volunteers at Reading Railroad Museum, jumped at the chance to restore a passenger train and keep it running. \n\"I've been doing this stuff since I was 11,\" he says. \"It's become a lifestyle. I've always been interested in the mechanical side of things.\" \nThe train is unusual in that it consists of three cabooses and an open car, one of which goes back to 1874. It is pulled by what Bast says is the second-oldest operating diesel engine, originally built for a railroad in Bethlehem in 1937. \nPHOTO GALLERY: A look back at when trains were king in the Lehigh Valley \n\"Our diesel locomotive is one of the longest running locomotives in the country,\" says Lindsay Bast. \nVolunteers are restoring a coach car, which the Basts hope to put into operation this fall. \nThe railroad ran passenger rides at Easter as well as for the Kutztown Folk Festival, a Firefly Express in July and rides during the Kutztown Bicentennial Celebration. \nThe Basts don't plan to open the railroad every weekend, but rather will run it for special events. Coming up are trick-or-treat rides, during which children can wear costumes and pick out a pumpkin. They also plan to run a train ride to buy a Christmas tree on Dec. 5 and train rides with Santa Claus Dec. 6, 12, 13, 19 and 20. \n\"We've had phenomenal response so far this year,\" Michael Bast says. \"We've done extremely well. We've had 7,000 people ride the train, and there's lots of community support.\" \nFor the bicentennial rides, the couple brought in a steam engine. \"It was an exciting and wonderful experience,\" Lindsay Bast says. \nBut right now, the trio of cabooses offer riders a different experience than other area railroads. \nOur caboose included a working coal stove, a small sink and a table and benches, making it clear this was where someone in days past spent much of their time. Cabooses were used on every freight train until the 1980s, when technology made them no longer necessary. \nThe train started with a jolt that forced one crew member standing in the center of the caboose to grab a support bar designed just for that purpose. With a creak, the train begins rolling down the track. \nThe train goes across several railroad street crossings, where cars wait for the train to pass. In a pond, a pair of swans glide serenely and at a passing farm a young boys sits and waves to passengers. The open car, which has wooden benches and guard rails, also offers a great view of the bucolic scenery. \nJim Schlegel is president of Kutztown Transportation Authority, which owns the track and right-of-way. He also volunteers as a conductor. \n\"It's been a really good experience,\" he says. \"It's my home away from home.\" \nSchlegel says the borough of Kutztown owns the property that includes the train track. \"The borough can't have a railroad, but they can form an authority to run it,\" he says. \nThe borough, he says, hasn't spent a penny on the railroad, which he says pays for itself. \nThe railroad on the weekend uses the borough-owned train station, which is home during the week to the borough's council meetings. \nLindsay Bast notes that the railroad is a privately owned and funded company. \nThey hope to get freight customers to help defray expenses for the passenger rides. \nLindsay Bast says they are working on the railroad schedule for 2016. \"It's been a wild success,\" she says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T12:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T15:26:47.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
