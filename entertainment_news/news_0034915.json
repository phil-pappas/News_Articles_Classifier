(Photo: KING) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nSEATTLE -- \"This was my initial introduction to music awesomeness,\" said Joe Skyward, picking up his battered Fender bass at a Seattle rehearsal studio. \nHe is reuniting with legendary Seattle collective Sky Cries Mary. Saturday will be the first time Skyward has played with his old band in 21 years. \n\"I consider these guys my brothers and sisters,\" he said. \"It's good to get the family back together.\" \nRock and roll has been good to Skyward. He's made a life of music. He pays the bills as a bartender and still does session work in L.A. \n\"I got to tour the world and play really good music, did the whole sex, drugs, rock & roll thing. I got to do exactly what I wanted to do,” he said. \nAlong the way Skyward raised two kids, and at 56, he now has his first grandchild. It's a love he never knew existed. \n\"It's just opens up a whole new world,\" he said. \nSkyward thought life couldn't get much better. \n\"Everything was going perfectly and then – BAM. I find out I have cancer,\" he said. \nSkyward had the recommended prostate check-up when he turned 50 and was fine, but he never got another annual check-up. Less than 5 years later he was diagnosed with stage 4 prostate cancer that had metastasized into his skeletal system, lungs and liver. \nLike a lot of guys, he just never gave his health much thought. \n\"I was just always going to do it later,\" he said. \"The only person I can really blame for the situation I'm in is me.\" \nSo, it will be a bittersweet reunion on Saturday, one put together to raise money for Skyward's medical bills. \nHe is quick to say, however, that the main reason for going public isn't to help himself. It isn't even to raise prostate cancer awareness. It is to urge all men to simply start taking better care of themselves, to start going to the doctor, quit smoking, lose weight. \nSkyward admits they are all very \"unrockstar-like\" things, but these days it's more about simple harmony. \n\"When you get to a certain point in your life, you have to start paying attention,\" he said. \nSky Cries Mary plays a sold out show Saturday night at Neumo's on Seattle's Capitol Hill. Tickets are still available for the all-ages matinee on Sunday afternoon.
