I'm telling you, she's like Belle from 'Beauty and the Beast'', Bilson was quoted as telling PEOPLE. \nNearly a year after giving birth to daughter Briar Rose, Rachel Bilson has nothing but adoration for her little girl. Speaking to PEOPLE at No Kid Hungry's Dinner to End Childhood Hunger at The Four Seasons in Los Angeles last Wednesday, October 14, she said Briar is more like Belle from the famous film \"Beauty and the Beast\". \"She likes all books. I'm telling you, she's like Belle from 'Beauty and the Beast'\", the actress and mother of one was quoted as saying, adding, \"She is very well-read.\" Bilson, moreover, jokingly told PEOPLE Briar \"might be an Olympic gymnast next month. She's crazy.\" Another thing that Bilson admired from daughter Briar was her fashion sense. When asked who her living style icon was, she giggled before then answering, \"My daughter.\" Bilson and Hayden Christensen welcomed the arrival of Briar, their first child together, on October 29, 2014. Back in August this year, the screen beauty shared the first ever pic of Briar on her Instagram page. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:52:15.577+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
