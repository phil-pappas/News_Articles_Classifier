The 33-year-old's bandmates announced the news on their official Facebook page.\n\"It is with the greatest sadness, that we must share the news that Carey passed away peacefully this morning after her illness with cancer.\n\"We have lost our friend and band mate, and our deepest sympathy goes out to her partner Kenny, and to all her family and friends,\" wrote Tracyanne Campbell, Gavin Dunbar, Kenny McKeeve and Lee Thomson.\nLander was diagnosed with osteosarcoma in 2011 but revealed earlier this year that it had returned. The band cancelled a number of shows in North American while she was treated.\nA JustGiving fundraising campaign for research into the illness has raised over Â£60,000.\nShe wrote on the page: \"It's probably too late to help me, but it would be great if we could find something in the future that means children don't have to undergo such awful treatment and have a better chance of survival.\"\nLander joined the band in 2002 and featured on albums including Underachievers Please Try Harder and Let's Get Out Of This Country.\nZooey Deschanel, Dermot O'Leary and Lauren Laverne are among those who have paid tribute to her on Twitter.\nCamera Obscura finished their Facebook message with: \"She was left in no doubt how much you all loved and appreciated her, and we'd like to thank you all for the support and kind words you have been sending to us and her.\n\"The band, our music, and all of you who have enjoyed it over the years, meant so much to her.\n\"Thank you all, Tracyanne, Gavin, Kenny and Lee x\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T15:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T14:55:50.933+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
