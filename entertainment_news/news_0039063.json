A radio host (Shatner) weaves together accounts of a family's unfortunate outing to retrieve a Christmas tree, a student documentary project that becomes a living nightmare, a spoiled suburban family's encounter with an angry figure from Alpine folklore and a plague at the North Pole that turns Santa's elves into foul-mouthed zombies.\nDirected by: Grant Harvey, Steven Hoban, Brett Sullivan\nLength: 1 hour, 39 minutes\nRated: Not rated\nOther: Also available Friday via iTunes and video on demand\nDENNIS HARVEY, VARIETY: Three stars out of four stars. Not the first, worst or most tasteless yuletide film frightfest by any means, “A Christmas Horror Story” offers five interwoven, variably comedic tales of terror set on Christmas Eve. None is particularly original (though there is one good final twist), but they’re all reasonably entertaining as executed by three Canadian helmers, including veteran genre producer Steven Hoban (“Splice,” the “Ginger Snaps” series), making his feature directorial bow. Even if the season to be jolly does seem to commence earlier every year, releasing this opus on Oct. 2 does feel a bit ridiculous. Still, that limited stateside theatrical launch (simultaneous with VOD and iTunes) should prove useful in boosting rental visibility closer to the relevant holiday; the pic should also rack up healthy cable sales.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:24:22.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
