Sharon Reich reports.   \nHarry Potter is back but this time, the eighth installment is a play scheduled to open in London next summer. The story for \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,\" is part-written by J.K. Rowling and picks up where the seventh and final volume of the saga left off -- with a plot centered around a grown-up Harry and his youngest child, Albus. And by the way ... Harry has three kids! The play is actually told in two parts, which are meant to be seen either on the same day, or on two consecutive nights. That's a lot of Potter... But so far, nearly everything Harry has turned to gold. Rowling's books sold over 450 million copies and are available in 78 languages ... The eight-part film franchise based on the books grossed more than $7 billion U.S. dollars at the worldwide box office. Tickets for the 16-week-run, which begins in July 2016, will go on sale on October 30th.  //reut.rs/1NYBsmi", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T00:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:05:45.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
