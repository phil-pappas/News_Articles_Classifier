Welcome back, Megyn Kelly — again 1  /  2 Back to Gallery It will be her second homecoming in the span of a single school year.\nFox News host Megyn Kelly is returning to the Capital Region in May to deliver the keynote address at Albany Law School's 2016 commencement ceremony. The high-profile journalist and political commentator was just in town last month at another of her alma maters — Bethlehem High School , where she was inducted into the hall of fame alongside three other accomplished graduates.\nKelly was born in Syracuse, but moved to the suburbs of Albany while still in grade school. She graduated Bethlehem High in 1988 and went on to earn an undergraduate degree in political science from Syracuse University and then a J.D. from Albany Law School in 1995.\n\"It's an honor to have this opportunity to address the lawyers of tomorrow, especially at Albany Law School, which laid the foundation for my career, both in the courtroom and the newsroom,\" Kelly said in a news release.\nThe host of The Kelly File rose to fame after joining Fox News in 2004. Last year, Time Magazine named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world. Just this summer, her name circulated in the news after Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump hurled what many viewed as a sexist remark her way following a tough line of questioning during the first presidential debate of the season.\nKelly returned to the Albany Law School campus in 2010 for her 15th class reunion, where she was honored with an Alumni Achievement Award.\n\"Megyn Kelly's career is a great example of the possibilities one can achieve with an Albany Law degree, and we're thrilled to have her deliver the keynote at our 165th commencement,\" said Albany Law School President and Dean Alicia Ouellette in the release. \nThe 2016 commencement ceremony will be held May 20 at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center in Saratoga Springs.\n—Bethany Bump \nFirst-time rock hall nominees revealed \nJanet Jackson , Steve Miller , Chicago and The Cars are among the first-time nominees being considered for induction next year in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\nCheap Trick , Los Lobos , Chaka Khan and James Brown 's famed backup band The J.B. 's also are new to the ballot. Eight of the 15 potential honorees are first-timers, although none are in their first year of eligibility.\nMore than 800 artists and members of the music industry vote on the inductees, who will be announced in December. Fans can also vote on the rock hall's website toward a \"fan's ballot\" that will also be counted.\nArtists back on the ballot for another try are Chic , Deep Purple , N.W.A. , Nine Inch Nails , the Smiths , the Spinners and Yes \n— Associated Press \nColleague recalls Chef Prudhomme \nPaul Prudhomme , the Cajun who popularized spicy Louisiana cuisine and became one of the first American restaurant chefs to achieve worldwide fame, died Thursday. He was 75.\nTiffanie Roppolo , the CFO of Prudhomme's businesses, told The Associated Press that he died early Thursday after a brief illness.\nPrudhomme became prominent in the early 1980s, soon after opening K-Paul's Louisiana Kitchen, a French Quarter diner that served the meals of his childhood. He had no formal training, but sparked a nationwide interest in Cajun food by serving dishes — gumbo, etouffee and jambalaya — that were virtually unknown outside Louisiana.\nThe distinctly American chef became a sensation at a time when the country's top restaurants served virtually nothing but European food.\n\"He was always on a mission and nothing was impossible for Paul. He did things his way and let the food speak for itself,\" said chef Frank Brigtsen , who worked for Prudhomme for seven years. \"He changed the way we eat in New Orleans in a major way, by bringing Acadian or Cajun cuisine to the restaurants of the city.\"\nPrudhomme was known for his innovations. His most famous dishes used the technique he called blackening: fish or meat covered with spices, then seared until black in a white-hot skillet. \n— Associated Press \nSelena Gomez talks about her lupus \nSelena Gomez has revealed that she's battling the debilitating immune system disorder lupus.\n\"I was diagnosed with lupus, and I've been through chemotherapy,\" the singer told Billboard magazine in an interview published Thursday.\nGomez, 23, was in \"Wizards of Waverly Place\" before becoming a pop star. She says she was treated in late 2013 and early 2014 after she canceled the Asian and Australian legs of her Stars Dance tour.\nLupus causes fibrous tissue and inflammation of internal organs, skin rashes and joint pain and affects women nine times more than men. Organs affected include the kidneys, heart and lungs.\n— Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:32:33.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
