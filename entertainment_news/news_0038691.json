News: \"First of all she's the best, and I'm so proud of her. I thought that was so bada**. \n\"I, of course, support wage equality and all equality, but if we just raise the minimum wage ... that would take care of everybody.\" \nJennifer admitted in the essay that while she was shocked to learn that she and her American Hustle co-star Amy Adams were paid considerably less for their roles in the movie than Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, and Jeremy Renner, she blamed herself because she \"failed as a negotiator\". \nMeanwhile, the Inside Amy Schumer star thinks women need to be more supportive of each other in general. \nSpeaking at the 22nd Annual ELLE Women in Hollywood Awards on October 19, she told the crowd: \"We need to focus all our energy on raising each other up and just living to our full potential because if we don't do it--the women in this room--if we don't do it, then who will?\" \nAmy also revealed at the event she regularly receives death threats and is starting to feel overexposed. \nShe said: \"I've already gotten a lot of death threats for about eight years...The backlash has already started. I've been getting backlash since 2006. I've been getting death threats. \n\"I know everybody is sick of me and I need to be treated for overexposure.\" amy schumer", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:13:37.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
