More than 127,000 city parents have logged on to a new Web service to see their kids’ grades, attendance records and more, Education Department officials said Monday.\nThe NYC Schools Account went online June 8 and replaced an earlier computer system that was widely criticized as unwieldy and too costly.\nIn addition to attendance and grades, the service allows public school parents to check students’ standardized test scores and class schedules.\nCity Schools Chancellor Carmen Fariña said the new online tool is part of the city’s larger effort to boost family involvement in the public schools.\n“We’re making it easier for parents to become more involved,” Fariña said. “Now we’ve seen an unprecedented number of families registered for online access.”\nSusan Watts/New York Daily News NYC Schools Chancellor Carmen Farina said the Education Department has seen an unprecedented number of parents register for online access. NYC Schools Account features a mobile app and the ability to post kids’ state math and reading test scores the same day they’re released.\nThe online system was designed in-house and cost about $2 million to create. It will cost another $4 million to maintain over the next four years.\nThat’s just a fraction of the $95 million Achievement Reporting and Innovation System, or ARIS, implemented by then-Schools Chancellor Joel Klein in 2007.\nAs of Friday, NYC Schools Account was being used by more than three times as many families as ARIS, which peaked at about 40,000 users in September 2014.\nFor families with more than one child, parents or guardians can use a single account to monitor the progress of multiple children enrolled in different city schools.\nA whopping 152,844 students had NYC Schools Account, out of roughly 1.1 million kids enrolled in the city schools, education officials said.\nLara Bianchi, a lawyer from Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, first used the city’s new online system to check on her daughter’s grades in June.\n“You don’t even need a paper report card, because you just log on and see the grades there,” said Bianchi, whose daughter Francesca is in fifth grade at Public School 185. “It’s very user-friendly.”\nRelated Stories De Blasio faces parents at struggling Brooklyn school NYC kindergarten offer letters will be sent earlier: DOE NYC public schools close for Muslim holiday for first time", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:44:21.559+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
