(PRWEB) October 08, 2015\nAll About Events , the Paso Robles tent rentals specialists, proudly announces the arrival of exciting new inventory to serve the Central Coast’s event needs.\nThe most impressive addition to the All About Events inventory is the largest sail cloth tent now available on the Central Coast. The new tent boasts twin peaks and dimensions of 60 feet by 100 feet. The large-scale expandable tent can accommodate up to 350 people seated, or up to 600 people for a cocktail-style event.\nPaso Robles tent rentals expert and All About Events owner, Steven Herring, says that tents are popular at weddings and large events. His company’s tents have been used at events including the Mac and Cheese Festival, Earth Day, and Beaverstock Festival, to name a few. He is excited that adding a larger sail cloth tent to his inventory will expand options available to event promoters in the area.\nHerring explains that sail cloth tents differ from traditional event tents in several ways. Most notably, sail cloth tents feature raw wood polls and create a more rustic feel. Additionally, the sail cloth top lets in more light compared to heavy canvas. All About Events’ new tent will debut at an undisclosed event on the Central Coast this coming November.\nIn addition to Paso Robles tent rentals, All About Events offers a wide range of additional event rentals. Currently, they offer eight styles of chairs ranging from Samsonite to high-end Louis X plush chairs. The company recently added 40 rustic cross back bar chairs to its inventory, which are ideal for a cocktail party or similar event.\nNot only is “rustic chic” currently a popular trend in events, but according to Herring, “gold is very ‘in’ right now.” All About Events has added gold flatware, gold beaded chargers, and gold Chiavari chairs to its inventory to meet customers’ needs.\nA unique aspect of All About Events is the fact that their farmhouse-style furniture is custom built and stained in-house. One of their most popular items is the so-called “Hemlock bar.” The bar was built using wood from a fallen down barn in Kentucky named the Hemlock barn.\nAbout All About Events\nAll About Events, a locally owned and operated Paso Robles tent rentals and event rentals company, prides itself in setting the new standard in quality event rentals on the Central Coast.\nAll About Events maintains two showrooms, two warehouses, and a business office. Owner Steven Herring got his start in the event rentals business in 2007. While working for a local catering business on the Central Coast, he observed a need for a local company that offered quality equipment and service. His business began with an inventory comprised of only folding tables and chairs which he hauled in a trailer; today his company has grown to 19 employees and offers a wide range of Paso Robles tent rentals, linens, China, furniture and more. All About Events has been featured in the San Luis Obispo County Visitors Guide as a leading tent, party and wedding rental company .\nCall today at (805) 239-7777, or visit their website at allaboutevents.com .
