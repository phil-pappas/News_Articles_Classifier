No Fences, a country duo from Fort Collins, will open for Bowersox.She has released two albums since her reality show stint. Her most recent full-length album, \"All That for This,\" was released in 2013. Her music is country and rock-inspired, delivered in her booming singing voice.Even though she said she competed on \"American Idol\" for two reasons - necessity and desperation - she said she has since become more honest with herself as a person and an artist. She said the reality competition was one of the hardest things she has ever done.However, she was the first woman to make it to the final round of the competition since Jordin Sparks won in 2007. She also became the first contestant on the show to have one of her original pieces performed on the show. During her run, she was never voted into the bottom three.\"As you grow, you change,\" she said.Along with her music, Bowersox is a champion for diabetes research and getting awareness out for the disease. She has been a type-1 diabetic since she was 6, and said she is looking to do more in the diabetes community, such as hosting an event.She said the disease has influenced her in \"every single way.\"\"My outlook has to be positive,\" she said.Currently, she is working on new music, but she said she constantly writes and works on new material. She said her goal is to make a record that's \"deeply personal.\"\"My definition of success is doing what you love for a living and you're paying the bills,\" she said. \"I don't need a bunch of junk in my life.
