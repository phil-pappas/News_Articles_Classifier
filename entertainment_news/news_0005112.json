Their single \"S.O.B\" is currently at the top of the Adult Alternative Songs airplay chart -- and that's despite (or because of) the fact that the chorus repeatedly involves the singer shouting a euphemism for \"female dog\" that we can't type on this family-friendly news site. \nAccording to Billboard, the song has gained 7 percent in plays at the format during the Oct. 24 tracking week, and 9 percent growth in digital sales, to 14,000. \nIt has been streamed 761,000 times during this period – a 16 percent increase from the previous tracking period. \nNathaniel Rateliff has been a staple in Colorado's music scene for years, but got the nation to catch on to him thanks to his newly soulful sound (and the Night Sweats, obviously). \nNow, somebody get me a ... chocolate milk, because I'm at work (like the lede, this is a not-so-clever reference to the song's lyrics). \nAnd while you're doing that, watch the video for \"S.O.B\" below: \n(© 2015 KUSA) Read or Share this story: http://on9news.tv/1LyEkUi More Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T01:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:04:49.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
