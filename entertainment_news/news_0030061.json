Walnuts are the only nuts that contain a significant amount of omega 3 fatty acids. So enjoy them.\nI like how the crisp, sweet apple flavor in this recipe contrasts with the slightly bitter Belgian endive and the toasty walnut pieces. Dried figs give the vinaigrette body and a fruity richness. The slightly sweet white balsamic vinegar complements the endive. If you don't have white balsamic, use rice wine vinegar instead.\nThis salad is an especially nice beginning to an elegant dinner. It works equally well when served as a delicious ending to your dinner. Some salad tips:\n1. When measuring the walnuts, chop them first so you have an accurate amount.\n2. Choose crisp, firmly packed Belgian endive heads that are white or pale yellow in color. Red endive should be bright colored with no wrinkled leaves. If the endive is very green, it might be bitter\n3. Store endive in the vegetable drawer of your refrigerator. I like to wrap the stalks in paper towels in a lock-top plastic bag.\n4. Wipe the outer leaves with a damp paper towel. Remove any torn or damaged leaves, trim the bottom, and use them as the recipe suggests.\n5. The salad may be made through Step 2, covered and refrigerated up to two hours ahead. Make sure to cover the salad tightly with plastic wrap so the apples won't turn brown. The dressing can be made up to one day ahead.\n• Diane Rossen Worthington can be reached at www.seriouslysimple.com\n© DIANE ROSSEN WORTHINGTON\nRelated Article\nBelgian endive salad with toasted walnuts, apples and fig vinaigrette Life & Entertainment Food Worthington, Diane", "external_links": ["http://www.seriouslysimple.com/", "https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-20T13:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:07:18.283+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
