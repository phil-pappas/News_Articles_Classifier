They fire up the kettles today to begin brewing the dark ale with fire-roasted barley, rye and wheat.\nThe beer began to absorb flavor last week, when Winer and Hermann quickly toasted 20 pounds of grains at 750 degrees in Pastoral’s $20,000 workhorse wood-fired Marra Forni Neapolitan pizza oven, reputedly made with stone from Mount Vesuvius.\n“The wood-fired oven darkened the malt a bit, but also made it sweeter,” said Hermann. “The malt took on some of the smoky wood aroma and gave a crunchy pizza-crust character to the flavor.”\nHermann took the grains to Harpoon’s pilot brewery, located within its larger Seaport facility, where starting today they’ll be mixed with additional malts to form the foundation of the rustic suds. Hops grown in Winer’s backyard will provide some additional local flavor (Massachusetts is an ideal climate for growing hops, whose leafy green and fast-growing vines make for an ideal decorative trellis cover).\nWiner was inspired by a dark bit of feudal Italian history.\n“When the aristocracy owned all the land, they’d go in after the harvest and burn the fields so peasants couldn’t scrape up the remaining grain,” Winer said. “With no grain in the fields, they’d be forced to buy it from the landlords.” Other versions of the story say that grain fields were burned as a traditional method of husbandry.\nRegardless, peasants salvaged whatever burnt grains they could to supplement their diet, the chef said. The Italian tradition of dark breads and pastas made from burnt grains (farina arso, literally, “burnt flour”) was born of this phenomenon.\nSmoky, fire-roasted beers have a strong foundation in traditional brewing history. All grains are toasted at some level in the malting process, which helps turn starches into fermentable sugars. Light color beers are made with lightly roasted grains. Dark beers are made with darkly roasted grains.\nBefore the era of gas-controlled malting technology, grains were typically toasted over open fires, infusing them with a dark, smoky character some liken to bacon or ham.\nThe famous Bavarian brewing city of Bamberg keeps this tradition alive today, with local beer-makers such as Schlenkerla and Spezial serving brownish, aromatic smoky-flavored “rauchbiers” (smoked beers) made with grains toasted over beechwood or oak logs.\nThe new Harpoon beer will have about 6.5 percent alcohol and will pour from taps later this autumn, exclusively at Pastoral.\n(Pastoral, 345 Congress St., 617-345-0005, pastoralfortpoint.com)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:27:50.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
