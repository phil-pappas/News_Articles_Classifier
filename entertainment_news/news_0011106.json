We only had two people shot dead on college campuses in America this past week, which feels like some kind of personal best. It's still unclear if we're supposed to blame one dead at Northern Arizona and one dead at Texas Southern on mental illness, or risk being called crazy if we think otherwise.\nAnd John Kasich, who often sounds like one of the more reasonable Republican candidates running for President, says in New Hampshire that guns aren’t really the problem. Kasich was in Stratham, N.H., according to the Boston Globe, and an 18-year old kid asked him a question about guns and wanting to feel safe at school, and this is how Kasich answered, sounding dumber than a “Housewives” television show in the process:\n“You have to prepare (at schools). You have to harden. The guns are not the problem,” Kasich said, apparently throwing in with the people who think that more college professors with automatic weapons will stop the next Rambo in a place like Roseburg, Ore.\nWhen the incredible shrinking Jeb Bush is asked about Roseburg, he says “stuff happens.” Ben Carson actually stands up and wants to tell everybody how brave and heroic he would have been if the shooter in Oregon had stuck a gun in his ear. It is nothing more than the usual discourse on guns from the righteous liberty-lovers on the right, most of them sounding as enlightened as hamsters.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA VISITS OREGON TOWN WHERE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SHOOTING OCCURRED, GREETED BY 300 UNHAPPY PRO-GUN PROTESTERS\nYou know what you wish sometimes? That the Second Amendment could actually speak for itself, perhaps remind all those who want even responsible gun owners to believe the government is coming for their guns that this was an amendment written for muskets and mountain men. You wish that Kasich or Bush or Carson or Marco Rubio or any of them could properly explain why they think we need 270 million guns in this country, and that may be on the low side.\nAfter thousands dead from gun violence, nothing has changed. Understand: This isn’t about illegal guns, or gun-show loopholes for buying guns, or the lunacy of having automatic weapons available in the general population; or resistance to background checks, or more efficient databases that might flag somebody like the Roseburg shooter owning more than a dozen guns, apparently in case he wanted to invade Northern California. This is about a country where it seems guns are as popular as cellphones, even as we’re told that undocumented immigrants are the greatest threat to our way of life.\nSENATE DEMOCRATS GATHER ON CAPITOL STEPS TO RALLY FOR ACTION AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE\nAnd the very best part of this, according to new reporting by medical writer Mike Stobbe of The Associated Press? The best part is that we have a government that doesn’t even want to research causes and possible solutions for the kind of bloodshed guns routinely cause in America, the constant loss of life, inevitably followed by the predictable claptrap from politicians who’ve turned themselves out for the National Rifle Association that the issue here is mental illness and only mental illness. Sure it is. Tell that to the victims of gun violence in a place like Chicago.\nThis is what Stobbe of the AP writes:\n“Gun interests, wary of any possible limits on weaponry, have successfully lobbied for limitations on government research and funding, and private sources have not filled the breach. So funding for basic gun violence research and data collection remains minuscule — the annual sum total for all gun violence research projects appears to be well under $5 million. A grant for a single study in areas like autism, cancer or HIV can be more than twice that much.”\nRyan Kang/AP Gun activists say the solution to gun violence is more guns. He writes: “But many young researchers are staying away from the field. Some believe there’s little hope Congress will do anything substantive to reduce gun violence, regardless of what scientists find. And the work is stressful — many who study gun violence report receiving angry emails and death threats from believers in unrestricted gun ownership.”\nThis is in a country, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, where guns are as much of a disease as anything we have; where guns are in the top five killers of people between the ages of 1 and 64. It makes you want to salute the nearest flag.\nNot only aren’t we supposed to look for ways to reduce gun violence, and an insane amount of bloodshed and mass murders, we’re not even supposed to look for possible solutions, even as enough thrillingly gutless politicians in Congress continue to tell us that the laws we have on the books work just fine, even with an average of 32,000 gun deaths in America a year.\nIt means that all those promoting the lie that any attempt on gun control is an assault on liberty and the Second Amendment don’t want to know what they don’t want to know. It never stops them from accusing President Obama , when he gets a break from mass shootings, of politicizing this issue.\nAnybody who believes that, and actually believes the President is the problem here, is the one who needs to have his head examined.\nRelated Stories Pro-gun residents unhappy with Obama visiting Ore. town Freshman killed in Texas Southern University shooting named Freshman killed in Texas Southern University shooting named Stasi: Parents of gun-toting kids should be held responsible", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:18:33.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
