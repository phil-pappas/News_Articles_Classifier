Although the company has yet to make a formal announcement or list Las Vegas under the \"coming soon\" locations on its website, it has started advertising for employees. Open positions in 19 categories from banquet chef to winner's circle are listed on the site, www.daveandbusters.com .\nWinner's circle? Well, a big part of Dave & Buster's appeal is the hundreds of games — and hundreds of prizes — featured at each of its locations. That's why an opening for senior games technician also is listed. And Dave & Buster's is a high-energy place, so they're also looking for a \"mix master.\"\nAnd yes, it's a restaurant, serving everything from sandwiches to steaks.\nThe company lists the location as Sahara Avenue and the 215 Beltway, so it appears the new restaurant will be in or very close to Downtown Summerlin.\nIf you're eager to dine there and just can't wait, a few other sports-oriented restaurants have opened in the valley recently or are about to. Pete Rose Bar & Grill opened Tuesday at the Hawaiian Marketplace on the Strip, a Buffalo Wild Wings will open Monday at the Miracle Mile Shops on the Strip, and a Hooter's, billed as the world's largest, opened last month at the Palms.\nContact Heidi Knapp Rinella at Hrinella@reviewjournal.com .
