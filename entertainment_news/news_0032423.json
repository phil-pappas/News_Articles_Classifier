Pasha’s bum is the one. Pasha could crack walnuts with those glutes. #SCD \n— Sybil Disobedience (@PaolaOeste) October 10, 2015 Pasha's bottom. That's all. #scd \n— Leó Kristófersson (@RuPaulology) October 10, 2015 \nPasha and Carol’s quickstep wasn’t a massive hit with the judges, but the watching public barely noticed. They didn’t seem to be paying much attention to the footwork. \n2. Spatulistic is not a word. (Guy Levy/BBC) \n— Andy Horton (@fechtbuch) October 10, 2015 Spatulistic? What next? Breadknifelike? Rollingpinish? #SCD \n— Darren Jalland ن (@larbertred) October 10, 2015 Spatulistic: adj. like a spatula, used in dance reviewing. #strictlycomedancing \n— Emily Cook (@emilycook8) October 10, 2015 \nCraig pulled out his favourite word while describing Anthony’s hands during his Rocky routine. It was time to down your glass of something cold for anyone playing a Strictly drinking game, but however many times he says it we will not be convinced it’s a real word. Promoted stories \n3. Anton can’t do Latin. Think Anton needs to hire a Latin choreographer ASAP 😜😜 #scd \n— Suzy B (@Suzy2201) October 10, 2015 Love Katie but that routine was awful. Completely agree with Craig. No idea what Anton was thinking. Just lots of walking around. #SCD \n— Louise Walklin (@louisewalklin) October 10, 2015 Katie's going to suffer on all the Latin dances if Anton can't pull up his socks a bit #Strictly \n— Strictly Dancers (@strictlydancers) October 10, 2015 \nThis is not news – we know Anton’s a ballroom kinda guy. But the cha-cha he put together for Katie was a bit of a horror show. She barely moved and, unsurprisingly, saw her score drop from 28 last week to 20. At least Anton was good enough to take the blame. \n4. Realism isn’t terribly important in a Charleston. 11 yr old pointing out all the Star Wars mistakes in this dance. Wrong coloured light sabre, etc #strictly \n— Jackie P (@jackiepatie) October 10, 2015 You can't hold a light sabre by the lighty bit. CHRIST! #Strictly \n— David Ephgrave (@David_Ephgrave) October 10, 2015 My house echoes with cries of \"Leia never had a light sabre!\" #strictlycomedancing \n— qp nell (@qpnell) October 10, 2015 \nKevin and Kellie provided one of the highlights of the night with a Charleston to the Cantina theme from Star Wars – complete with lightsaber canes – but hardcore fans were not impressed. It didn’t matter much – they racked up an impressive 32 from the judges. \n5. This was a good weekend for the penguin emoji. Flippin' love Ainsley🐧🐧🐧 #strictly \n— Sarah Ellis (@sarahlucyellis) October 10, 2015 Penguins and ainsley being a penguin 🐧 😊 i like ainsley,he forgets his footwork cos he gets sooo excited&u can tell he loves it 🐧 #Strictly \n— Clara Dunne (@supadunnie) October 10, 2015 I loved that #Strictly #scd (Ainsley & Natalie) 🐧🐧 \nAinsley and Natalie did a slightly dodgy penguin routine to Happy Feet. The celebrity chef’s errors meant the scores were way down, but who cares? Penguins!! \n6. The writing’s on the wall for Sam Smith. Seriously? THAT'S the Bond theme? #scd \n— Eddie Spencer-Small (@eddbot) October 10, 2015 The #scd guy can surely be the only singer capable of making Writing's On The Wall even worse than the Sam Smith version", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T13:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T15:27:32.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
