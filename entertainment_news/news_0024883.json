(Amazon Prime), Disney TV movie Descendants, and Wonder Quest (YouTube).\nHayley Atwell in the season finale of \"Marvel's Agent Carter.\" (Photo: Kelsey McNeal, ABC)\n\"The proliferation of platforms and cable networks has made it a very complex media landscape for families to navigate,\" said Common Sense CEO and founder Jim Steyer in a statement. \"There's a lot of content being created, but the quality isn't always there. For families with young teens especially, the options, this year, are few and far between.\"\nCommon Sense Media assessed more than 300 movies and TV episodes released this year, taking into account overall quality based on entertainment value, engagement, impact, worthwhile themes, messages, and role models.\nEllie Kemper, left, and Jane Krakowski in Netflix's \"Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.\" (Photo: Eric Liebowitz, Netflix)\nNetflix gathered more awards than any other streaming service, channel or network. \"We're honored to be in such great company,\" said Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos in a statement. \"We're proud of the diverse slate we've created for families, from Puffin Rock and Dinotrux for younger kids to Project MC2 and Dragons: Race to the Edge for older kids, and even Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt , which both teens and their parents are loving.\"\nMost of the award winners (11) were for preschoolers (age 2â€“4).
