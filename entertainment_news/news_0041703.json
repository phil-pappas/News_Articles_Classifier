Awk. Well we’re glad Hugo’s got to the bottom of what he’s looking for in a date… 😂 #FirstDates pic.twitter.com/wBsFDreTti \n— First Dates (@C4FirstDates) October 22, 2015 \nHe was paired up with Opera singing beauty Olympia, and the two seemed made for each other. \"Olympia\" is a posh enough name for him. #FirstDates \nHugo again was his eccentric self. Is Hugo being played by Jim Carey, doing an English-accented version of Ace Ventura? #FirstDates \n— Inspector Morose (@InspectorMorose) October 22, 2015 Hugo is the real life every-character-that-Hugh-Grant-has-ever-played x 100 #firstdates \n— Emily Blunden (@atticusandfinch) October 22, 2015 \nBut unfortunately, the date ended on a bad note, as Hugo didn’t feel a “spark”. \nNext up was Jacqui & Ricky. Maybe save that until after dinner eh Jacqui? 😅 #FirstDates pic.twitter.com/rh1JVreBfp \n— First Dates (@C4FirstDates) October 22, 2015 \nWho you may recognise from the episode previews from previous weeks. \n— Auntie Pegg (@AuntiePegg) October 22, 2015 \nBut again, sparks didn’t fly here either. Ah no #FirstDates noooo! The post meal friend zone burn. \n— Kachela (@KachelaMurray) October 22, 2015 \nAnd things didn’t look any better for Newcastle beaut Georgia who was stood-up on her date. The guy who stood up the girl from Newcastle on #firstdates must be kicking himself right now, she is stunning, I would def take her out \n— Ashley Picton (@ashpicton) October 22, 2015 Imagine jibbing your blind date off then finding out Georgia was waiting for you. Daft bastard. #FirstDates \n— Amy Carter (@Carterface_) October 22, 2015 \nJust when you thought romance had died, in walked the handsome, and very sweet Alex who took Georgia’s fancy. But unfortunately, he was there to date someone else and twitter couldn’t believe it. How awkward. your sat with a girl who's boring you, and you can't help look a girl your attracted to, just follow your heart #firstdates \nBut fear not! The show revealed that next week Alex and Georgia will be paired up on a date together! How cute! Yes! Can't wait to see Georgia & Alex go on a date! 😊👏 Woop! #FirstDates \n— Maya Simone (@mayasphere) October 22, 2015 How awkward. your sat with a girl who's boring you, and you can't help look a girl your attracted to, just follow your heart #firstdates \nAnd in other lovey-dovey news, Steven went on a date with a woman who didn’t mind how in love with his Nan he is. Guy from Wrexham who loves his nan is so sweet I can't bare it! #FirstDates \n— Kay Dekker (@kay_way) October 22, 2015 #FirstDates You know exactly who I'm talking about pic.twitter.com/OweWOX7lna \n— mof gimmers (@mofgimmers) October 22, 2015 \nApparently Anna and Steven’s Nan are now knitting buddies. \n— First Dates (@C4FirstDates) October 22, 2015 Share article", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:21:27.803+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
