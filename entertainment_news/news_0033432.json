Photo by Andy Lyons/Getty Images First base for the Cincinnati Reds in 2015 was one of the few areas of stability and it was provided by one of the team's top performers in Joey Votto .\nVotto led the Reds in games played (158), runs scored (95), average (.314), on-base percentage(.459), OPS (1.000), and WAR (7). He added 29 homers (2nd), 33 doubles (3rd), 171 hits (2nd), and even had 11 stolen bases(4th). While he was great at making contact, Votto also had a keen eye for what pitches not to hit.\nHe led all of baseball with 143 walks which was 19 more than the Nationals Bryce Harper. Votto also finished in the top ten in the NL in OPS (3rd), slugging (4th), HR and average(7th), and runs (8th). His numbers overall were eerily similar to his 2013 campaign in which he played in all 162 games, but he was unable to stay healthy in 2014, appearing in just 62. Votto was nagged by a similar injury in 2012 when he played in 2012.\nHis injury last season led to Todd Frazier and Brayan Pena taking over at first and even a few disastrous starts by Jay Bruce. A healthy Votto took his spot on the right side of the infield 156 times throughout the season which left little opportunity for others, which was fine for Manager Bryan Price. When Votto did get a day off (or had a meltdown that led to an ejection ) five other players took their turn at first.\nAdam Duvall and Pena led the way with four appearances in relief of Votto. Duvall didn't come over until late in the season when the Reds acquired him from the Giants in exchange for Mike Leake. The former Louisville Cardinal is a corner infielder by trade, but the Reds also auditioned him in left field where he played 15 games. Duvall at the very least provides the some pop off the bench as he had five homers in 27 games. The versatile Ivan De Jesus Jr. made three stops at first base while Kristopher Negron and Chris Dominguez appeared twice.\nWith Duvall added and Frazier's ability to play first, the Reds have several options if the 2010 MVP finds himself on the disabled list in 2016. The Reds do not have any first baseman in their top prospects, but that is likely due to Votto being signed through 2024. As for Pena as a fill in option, his status is up in the air as he is a free agent at the end of season.\nBarring any injury, it's safe to say that Votto will be getting a majority of the playing time and will be on the field when the Phillies come to town on April 4.", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2014/09/18/joey-votto-injury-being-questioned/15841453/", "http://m.mlb.com/video/v103988183/cinpit-votto-ejected-in-the-3rd-inning", "http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/09/reds-joey-votto-completely-loses-it-after-getting-ejected-in-pirates-game"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:22:03.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
