It makes my life interesting.”\nCate Blanchett and Debicki in The Maids. Picture: Supplied Debicki, 25, is about to start shooting The Tale in Louisiana with Ellen Burstyn and Laura Dern.\nIt’s the latest in a string of big films on her resume that includes Baz Luhrmann’s The Great Gatsby, The Man From U.N.C.L.E., Everest and Macbeth.\n“I haven’t met them yet but I’m sure I’ll be totally starstruck,” she said.\nOther Stories Awesome All Blacks lay Cardiff ghosts to rest Rugby 0 comments Will Geoffrey ever find love again?

She last week attended the Miu Miu show at Paris Fashion week and dined with Muiccia Prada.\n“I guess I don’t think of myself as someone who is inherently fashionable,” she said.\n“I just find it such a fascinating world. I suppose I find how much I enjoy it surprising in a sense. Some designers want to dress me because I am tall and we can do outrageous shape things you couldn’t necessarily do with someone shorter.”\nElizabeth Debicki in a scene from film The Man From UNCLE. There is an upside to fashion Debicki is only realising now.\n“You can kind of use it to your advantage as an actor because it can be a bit of a circus,” she said.\n“While the focus is about the film, you can have a little forum to express something about yourself so if you find a designer you can align yourself with who does that in their work, you should keep the good thing going.\n“All of that red carpet stuff can be quite daunting so if you feel good about yourself, you find it a smoother process and you feel a lot more confident going out there and doing that stuff.”\nHigh heels and dresses are generally not for Debicki though.\n“I generally view heels as a slightly not evolved form of foot binding,” she said. “They’re not comfortable and they’re bad for your back. I don’t have the stamina for it.”\nMan From U.N.C.L.E (Official Trailer 2015) 2:18 Directed by Guy Ritchie and starring Henry Cavill, Armie Hammer, Alicia Vikander, Hugh Grant and Australia?s very own Elizabeth Debicki, the film is set in the early 1960s and follows CIA agent Napoleon Solo (Cavill)and KGB operative Illya Kuryakin (Ham\nFebruary 12th 2015 8 months ago /video/video.news.com.au/News/", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a357329320e020327329c837c45deeb2?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/1b8196d378545a40b81428ac5c711d9c", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/origin:video_integrator.NuaXlhczomB8oDAqHkD7qSE0uAHSEAp7?t_product=video&t_template=../video/player", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent6.video.news.com.au%2FNuaXlhczomB8oDAqHkD7qSE0uAHSEAp7%2Fpromo247973633&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c198465add868c793b99a326ce360cd7?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/dc7d892cacee3f19c7d455ef6927b7ea?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/99fcba8ae82c8c3a820d363ee6835cce", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c5cae69f6310b1ac75aa7260fd194394", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b0eb27853091a774fcb6de188930e46b", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/8f3fc487c88364970742ba4bbaf99415", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/273f8d21f4a54f0720388382dc1eee50", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-10-18T11:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T10:16:50.979+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
