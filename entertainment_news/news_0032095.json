The elderly couple dresses up as Carl and Ellie, using a walker/cane with tennis balls on the bottom and putting an old black-and-white photo on the cover of an Adventure Book. \nBlack's grandfather and grandmother play Carl and Ellie's theme song from \"Up\" on the piano, and it's so adorable you might not be able to watch without tissues. (Just like the movie!) The ultimate tearjerker moment is when she puts her head on his shoulder and they smile ever so subtly. \nThe viral video has already been viewed more than 300,000 times on YouTube, complete with comments wishing the pair a happy anniversary. \n\"My grandparents were very excited to be part of this video,\" Black, who appears at the end dressed up like the 8-year-old wilderness explorer named Russell, says. \"It was so fun to work with them on it. I've loved their piano duets ever since I was a little kid, so this will be a family treasure for all of us.\" \nThanks for the adventure.
