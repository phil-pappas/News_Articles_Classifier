This week the country is also in mourning.\nTwo apparent suicide bombers blew themselves up at a political rally last Saturday in Ankara, the capital, killing nearly 100 people and injuring many more. No group claimed responsibility for what's being called the worst terrorist attack in the country's modern history. The prime suspect is Islamic State, but there's more than one theory for a motive, a reflection of the volatility roiling Turkey.\nThe list of tensions and fractures is long: Turkey is at war with Islamic State and the Assad regime in Syria, plus Kurdish rebels at home. June parliamentary elections rebuked the powerful president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, but failed to establish a new government, requiring another round of voting on Nov. 1.\nErdogan's autocratic rule, including attacks on press freedom, encouraged the ballot box comeuppance he experienced, but at the heart of it all in Turkey is the ongoing conflict between ethnic Turks and Kurds. In June's elections, the legal, pro-Kurdish HDP Party did surprisingly well, destroying Erdogan's plans to strengthen the power of the presidency. The Ankara bombing took place at a rally of the HDP and other leftists.\nThings are such a mess that Turks and Kurds are bickering over responsibility for the bombing — not that there is any evidence of a Turkish government plot, but that some on each side blame each other. Depending on who's talking, either the Kurds are marginalized and vulnerable, or the Kurds are subversive and violent. There's enough animosity and angst that some fret about a return to the political violence of the 1970s. \"Certainly I fear that,\" Nobel Prize-winning author Orhan Pamuk told an Italian newspaper. \"Especially in the 1970s the streets of my city (Istanbul) witnessed a real conflict between people of the left and those of the right.\"\nNow, consider the bigger picture: Turkey opposes the brutal regime of Syria's Bashar Assad and was late to the fight against Islamic State but is now an active partner of the United States. (The U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State is flying sorties out of Incirlik Air Base.) The complication there is that the best troops on the ground in Syria fighting Islamic State are Kurdish rebels. And as much as Turkey wants peace in Syria, it hates seeing Kurds succeed because it does not want to see the rise of an independent Kurdish nation. Turkey also is dealing with a Syrian humanitarian crisis: More than 2 million refugees have fled from Syria to Turkey.\nThe many-sided conflict in Syria leads back to the suicide bombings. What happened? Assuming Islamic State was responsible, there are at least three motives: an attack on Turkey for being part of the U.S. alliance; revenge against the Kurds for fighting in Syria; an attempt to escalate tensions between ethnic Turks and Kurds.\nAdd up everything that's happened and Turkey is \"so deeply polarized\" after 13 years of Erdogan rule that the country is \"about to come apart at the seams,\" analyst Soner Cagaptay told The New York Times.\nThere is a path back to stability and it leads directly through Erdogan, if he can muster the statesmanship.\nThe government took a positive step by acknowledging security lapses at the rally and removing several officials, including Ankara's police chief. Turkey's best hope is that a November election leads to a stable, new government that forms quickly, while Erdogan permanently relinquishes aspirations to supersize his power. Erdogan recently built himself a presidential palace about 50 times the size of the White House, so selfless statesmanship may be tough for him to manage. But Turkey's future as a stable, prosperous democracy — and trusted U.S. ally — is on the line. So, too at some point is Turkey's candidacy for the EU.\nErdogan and the rest of Turkey's political players can't dictate what happens next in Syria, but they can do much more to control the situation at home.\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Middle East Turkey Syria Europe Terrorism Elections Recep Tayyip Erdogan", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56201b03/turbine/ct-turkey-bombing-erdogan-kurds-edit-20151015"], "published": "2015-10-16T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:15:06.714+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
