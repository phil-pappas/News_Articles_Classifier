When he staggered up an embankment to see what he hit, the injured seal lifted its head.\nSt. Paul police chief Nick Hunnicutt says he had to shoot the animal.\nJulie Speegle of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says the agency doesn't know of any previous seal-vehicle crashes.\nParnell says the roadway was 25 or 30 yards from the water.\n___\nInformation from: Alaska Dispatch News, http://www.adn.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1NWwUfZ"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:11:25.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
