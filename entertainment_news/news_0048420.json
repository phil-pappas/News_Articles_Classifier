Celebrating its 10th year, there has been such a big demand that in addition to the show at the Javits Center, it has expanded to utilize the nearby Hammerstein Ballroom to highlight TV programing by a number of networks. \nThe show is expected to draw in more than 150,000 fans with having nearly 1,000 exhibitors. There will be panel discussions, signings, merchandise for sale plus meet-and-greets with actors, authors and artists with their fans. \nThis year there are a couple of panels that have a buzz around them already. More space has been alloted to host panels on The Walking Dead, a revival of The X-Files after a 13 year hiatus and a panel for Batman fans on the 30th Anniversary of DC Comics The Dark Knight Returns,' among others. \nAlthough tickets for the four-day event are already sold out, fans can watch the New York Comic-Con 2015 live stream at the NYCC website . \nAristide Economopoulos can be reached at aeconomopoulos@njadvancemedia.com and you can follow him on Twitter at @AristideNJAM and Instagram Find NJ .com on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:37:38.736+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
