There were nerves, there were disasters, there were even comedy moments. \nHere are 11 things we won’t forget. 1. Everyone was being dramatic The Great British Bake Off’s Nadiya (Mark Bourdillon/BBC) \nThe music is getting faster and faster, icing is being frantically piped, someone is fretting next to an oven: the Great British Bake Off is undeniably dramatic. \nAfter 10 weeks of challenges, the bakers have reached the final – where a bad bake begins to seem like a life-or-death situation. So you can’t blame them for being a little melodramatic. \n“This could be a pivotal moment in my life, this weekend,” Ian said, while Nadiya added: “Whatever happens here today I will have to live with for the rest of my life.” \nPoor Tamal also went for just a little hyperbole: “This is the worst pastry in the world, ever.” \nAnd Ian moaned: “You do wonder why you put yourself through this, sometimes.” 2. But there was camaraderie A little selfie taken at the Final. How far we've come! Hope you enjoy tonight as much as we did filming it. #GBBO pic.twitter.com/DX3nb5GB6u \n— TAMAL RAY (@DrRayBakes) October 7, 2015 Promoted stories \nYou don’t get to the final without being fiercely competitive – but Nadiya and Tamal in particular have developed a lovely teasing relationship. \n“Thanks little chum,” Tamal said to 4ft 11 Nadiya as she helped him pick his baking implements off the floor. \nAnd when Nadiya decided not to batch-bake her buns according to Paul’s preferences, he was on hand to jokingly play on her fears: “If you want to break Paul’s rules…” 3. There were moments of panic When you can’t even bring yourself to look in the oven. #GBBO pic.twitter.com/ibWOWasEFO \n— British Bake Off (@BritishBakeOff) September 30, 2015 \nIt was hard not to feel sorry for Ian when he had the gut wrenching realisation: “Did I leave something out?” \nAlas for Ian, he’d forgotten to put sugar in his cardamom and cinnamon spiced iced buns with apple and cranberry jam. The mistake didn’t get past Mary and Paul, who quickly found out there was something dreadfully wrong with the buns and pulled disapproving faces. \nIt was a forgetful weekend for Ian, who puzzled over his showstopper curry carrot cake mixture – before realising: “I forgot to put the oranges in with the mixture!” Luckily, it wasn’t too late for a quick fix. \nOur hearts also went out to Tamal, who couldn’t get his creme patissiere to set in time. After lots of anxious checks on his creme pat in the freezer and rising panic, he cut his losses. “It’s so frustrating!” he complained to Nadiya. 4. And then there was the bun-whispering The Great British Bake Off’s Ian (Love Productions) \nWe always knew there was something of the Prince Charles about Ian – but instead of whispering to his plants to encourage them to grow, Ian whispers to his buns to help them rise. \n“Good luck little fellas” said Ian to his iced buns. “Come on, buns.” 5. There were plenty of puns Mel Giedroyc and Nadiya Jamir Hussain (Love Productions/BBC) \nOur favourite pun of the episode cam from Mel, announcing the end of the signature bake: “String up the bunting. This bun ting is over.” 6. The judges made withering comments The Great British Bake Off’s Mary Berry (Mark Bourdillon/Love Productions) \nAnd our favourite judge’s comment was from Mary, on Tamal’s millefeuille: “It looks as though you sat on the top to squash them all in.” Ouch. 7. There was also high praise Bake off final here we go !!! pic.twitter.com/YR0tn2lO7F \n— Paul Hollywood (@PaulHollywood) October 7, 2015 \nWhen the judges want to be nice, they can be very, very nice. Paul called Ian’s elderflower and lemon iced buns “dynamite”, while for Mary they were “sheer heaven on a plate”. 8. The technical challenge was personalised The Great British Bake Off’s Tamal, with Sue Perkins (Love Productions) \nWhen Paul and Mary asked the bakers to create rough-puff raspberry millefeulle, it wasn’t an accidental choice. They decided on the challenge because all the finalists have previously struggled with pastry. \nClever Nadiya didn’t take long to twig: “Do you think we’re being tested because we did bad pastry? It’s a personalised challenge just for us three.” \n“Oh, god, yeah!” said Ian, having flashbacks to cream horns and vol-au-vents. \nNadiya was convinced: “It is, I think it is!” 9. Paul Hollywood failed at intimidation Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry (BBC/Love Productions/Tom Dymond) \nAt the end of the showstopper challenge, just to make things a bit more stressful for the contestants, Paul and Mary walked around the tent asking intimidating questions. \n“Happy, Nadiya?” Paul asked menacingly. \n“Yeah,” she said, pausing before mocking him right back: “Happy, Paul?” \nAll Paul could do in reply was giggle. 10. We met the finalists’ families On the train home to Luton! See you soon mum and baba and the rest of my rowdy brood!!! Missing you abdal! 😘 pic.twitter.com/uPR95zp3NZ \n— Nadiya Jamir Hussain (@BegumNadiya) August 20, 2015 \nIt was time for a peek at the finalists’ back stories – and to meet their very cute kids. \nTamal’s big sister was super proud of him. “He’s the full package for me,” she said before starting to cry. We also got to look at baby photos: Tamal, it turns out, was a very cute kid. \n“My daddy’s done really well to get to the final,” said Ian’s cute blonde daughter, while his wife complained he’d become like a “man possessed” in the kitchen. \n“He’s a rock in our family. I’m very proud of him,” she added. \nNadiya’s husband was also supportive: “She’s a winner, she’s a champion in our eyes.” \n“I like lemon cakes, I like chocolate cakes, I like mud cakes,” proclaimed their daughter – which is good, with a mum like Nadiya. 11. And Nadiya won! The Great British Bake Off’s Nadiya (Mark Bourdillon/Love Productions) \nWith a first place in the technical challenge, an impressive set of iced buns and a beautiful showstopper wedding cake, Nadiya was on a high. It was her week – and her series – as she was crowned winner of the Great British Bake Off 2015. \nHurrah!
