They're so awesomely bad, we thought they were too good to be true - but Wilson is, in fact, a real lawyer . \n\"Loud and proud\" of his Texas roots, Wilson's extensive use of American flags and screeching hawks could make Stephen Colbert cry tears of joy. \nWilson does wheelies on a minibike, snatches a fish out of a stream, kicks down a door and even jumps out of a moving SUV in an amazing new series of ads. \nPolice know they're about to face the \"talons of justice\" when Wilson busts in like the Kool-Aid man shouting, \"Did someone call me?!\" \nHis ads might be the loudest, wildest thing on TV - and they're making headlines as far away as Germany. ( Das ist der wohl verr√ºckteste Anwalt der USA = This is the craziest lawyer in the USA) \n\"Commercial 3\" has been nearly almost a million times since it was posted on Oct. 20. \nWilson graduated from Texas Tech University School of Law and practices in Fort Worth, according to his website .
