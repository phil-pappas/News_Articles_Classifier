She's been making us laugh for a while now, especially in the super-weird and amazing Upright Citizens Brigade ; on Saturday Night Live ; and, of course, as Leslie Knope on Parks and Recreation, who is possibly the most vocal feminist character on any show in television history. Amy is also dedicated to inspiring and supporting young women with Smart Girls at the Party , an online community for \"teen girls who are ready to move against the crowd\" and change the world. Basically, if Amy's name is attached to something, we know that it's going to be funny and smart just like her.\nMore from Lenny 14 articles These October Horoscopes Really Tell It Like It Is 8 Attention-Grabbing Pieces You Need in Your... The Perfect Noodle Dish to Make When Dining Alone The Huge Mistake I Made During My First Week of... Which is why we were so thrilled when Amy wanted to interview Sydney Lucas for Lenny. Sydney is a Tony-nominated 12-year-old actress who just finished a much-heralded run in the Broadway production of Fun Home, a musical based on Alison Bechdel's graphic memoir of the same name. Sydney played Young Alison (the musical includes Young Alison, College Alison, and Adult Alison). She's a girl who is figuring out her sexuality and struggling with her strange relationship with her dad, who is masking his own complicated sexuality. Sydney was just nine when she started playing the role, which makes it even more impressive how deftly and maturely she dealt with these thorny issues onstage. Here, Amy and Sydney have a conversation about the secret to being a great actor (and, real talk: human), the importance of scooters and vitamins, and what Old Hollywood stars they believe they were in past lives. â€”Laia Garcia, Lenny associate editor\nAmy Poehler: I'm talking to Sydney at last! I was so moved by you and your performance in Fun Home, and I started talking to my friend Lena about how good you were and how great the show was, and I realized it might be cool to get a chance to talk to you for this newsletter. So I'm really happy and thrilled that you said yes!\nSydney Lucas: Of course I said yes! You guys are like my favorite people in the world!\nAP: That's really nice! I have to tell you that I'm so obsessed with the grind of a Broadway show. Having worked at SNL, I know what it's like to have to put on a weekly variety show, but I can't even imagine what it's like to put on a nightly show. What are you doing right now to prepare?\nSL: Well, if it's just one show, then I guess sleeping for a while, and I go on the Internet a lot. But when it's time for me to get ready, I take a shower, I eat breakfast, and I have D vitamins to help with my energy because that's very, very, very crucial. I also scooter around with the other kids at the theater.\nAP: Oh, cool, so you go to school at the theater.\nSL : Oh, no, I scooter with them!\nAP: Ohhh, \"scooter\"! I thought you said \"tutor.\" But scooter is much more fun. So you take vitamins, and you scooter.That's actually a really good exercise regimen for anyone, of any age. The reason why I'm asking you is because I got a chance to see your beautiful musical, and as I watched it, Sydney, I was just amazed at all the hard work you have to do. You have to sing, you have to dance, you have to dance on the piano, and you also have to have these really beautiful, emotional scenes. How do you make it fresh every single week?\nSL: One tip that my great acting teacher gave me was \"If it's the exact same show every day, then you're not actually listening to the other person.\" Because you don't say a line the exact same every day, and if you do, that means you're not actually listening to the person [speaking to you]. This show is about Alison, and she's a real live person, and we have to do our best to convey her life to the world as best we can.\nAP: When did you know you wanted to be an actor?\nSL: You know how in the show I sing \"Ring of Keys \"? [ Ed. note : \"Ring of Keys\" is a song from the musical when college-age Alison sees a girl at a diner who she simultaneously wants to be and is in love with; the girl helps her realize that she is a lesbian.] Alison doesn't know why she connects with this person, but all she sees are sparks when she sees this person. She doesn't know why, but she just does. That's what it's like with acting for me. When I was four, when I was really young, I used to see little girls or little kids on commercials, or even Broadway, and I saw those sparks. I just knew I wanted to do that. That was my \"Ring of Keys\" moment.\nAP: That is so cool. That song is so beautiful that you sing, and you have such a wisdom about you, Sydney. You have a real sense of play, and you feel like a 12-year-old, which is important, but man, you feel like you have this lovely weariness that comes with someone who's seen a little bit more of the world than others. So this brings me to this question: Do you believe in reincarnation and if so, do you think you have a past life and what was it?\nSL: YES! I do believe in reincarnation, and I believe Audrey Hepburn is reincarnated into me. Let me tell you why.\nAP: I totally agree, but tell me more.\nSL: During Tony season, the lovely Anna Wintour got a designer to make a dress for me, and I was trying to explain the dress I wanted. I tried to draw it but couldn't really do it, because I'm not that good of an artist. But I kept explaining, and then my manager said, \"Maybe you should go for an Audrey Hepburn style.\" I looked at him and said, \"THAT'S MY DRESS! THAT'S THE DRESS I'VE BEEN TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO YOU!\" I really feel like Audrey Hepburn is reincarnated into me because everybody keeps saying that I look like her! I don't know, who knows?\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMJvLTZOhpE", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/320x160/1444240348-landscape-1444071067-chili-noodles-lenny.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/320x160/1444240189-landscape-1444224949-slaughter-index.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/320x160/1444240734-landscape-1444069780-shirleykurata.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1280x960/1444334999-syn-cos-1444315362-jessrotter-poehler-illo.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/320x160/1444240477-landscape-1444071333-lenny-horoscopes-1800x1200-mech-high-res-1.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/768x576/1444334999-syn-cos-1444315362-jessrotter-poehler-illo.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/480x360/1444334999-syn-cos-1444315362-jessrotter-poehler-illo.jpg", "http://www.theatermania.com/broadway/news/sydney-lucas-final-performance-fun-home_74456.html", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/980x735/1444334999-syn-cos-1444315362-jessrotter-poehler-illo.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1600x1200/1444334999-syn-cos-1444315362-jessrotter-poehler-illo.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/640x480/1444334999-syn-cos-1444315362-jessrotter-poehler-illo.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T15:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:36:06.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
