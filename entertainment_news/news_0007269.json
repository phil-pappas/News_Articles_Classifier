Stine's beloved comedy/horror book series Goosebumps walked the red carpet at the Monday night premiere at New York City's AMC Empire 25. \nBlack, who mugged for the paparazzi, says his two sons, Sammy and Thomas, were a \"large part of the impetus\" for him taking the project, in which he plays a fictionalized, younger version of Stine. \n\"My boys being obsessed with monsters and scary apps on their iPads was definitely part of my decision process,\" says Black, who's also well known in the kiddie set for his voice work in the Kung-Fu Panda films and the hit School of Rock . \"I wanted to do something they would dig.\" \nGoosebumps, which also stars Dylan Minnette and Odeya Rush, opens Friday. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
