The Huffington Post UK | By Daniel Welsh \n‘Celebrity Big Brother’ finished, erm, about five minutes ago, but talk has already turned to which famous faces will be entering the house in January. READ MORE: \nDespite the fact the dust has barely settled on this summer’s series - not to mention the infamous ‘Bit On The Side’ brawl that came shortly before the final - Ferne McCann has already been named the first celebrity rumoured for the first of next year’s series. \nFerne recently took over from Gemma Collins as the resident drama queen on ‘The Only Way Is Essex, when The GC revealed she was leaving the series for good , and her feuds with several of her cast members have had us hooked since she joined the show in 2013. \nFerne McCann \nAccording to the Daily Star , Ferne has already signed up to take part in the show, but she’s far from the first ‘TOWIE’ cast member to do so. \nIn the past, Amy Childs , Kirk Norcross , Sam Faiers and Lauren Goodger have all enjoyed varying levels of success in the ‘CBB’ house, while Dan Osborne was originally tipped to appear in the last series, but ultimately failed to appear on the line-up. \nA spokesperson for the ITVBe docusoap has told the Daily Star that Ferne would not be leaving 'TOWIE' any time soon, insisting: \"Ferne has no current plans to leave the series.\" \nThe most recent ‘UK vs USA’-themed series was won by former ‘Apprentice’ candidate James Hill , from Team UK, who beat reality star Austin Armacost and Atomic Kitten singer Natasha Hamilton in the live final last month, scooping an impressive 45.16% of the votes cast . Close 'TOWIE' Stars: Where Are They Now? of   Sam left 'TOWIE' earlier in 2014, following her diagnosis with Crohn's disease. She's since reunited with her former fiancé Joey Essex, and still runs Minnies Boutique in Essex, with her sister, Billie. Since leaving 'The Only Way Is Essex', Mark has put aside his womanising ways and is now happily engaged to former 'Coronation Street' actress Michelle Keegan. He's currently taking part in the most recent series of 'Strictly Come Dancing', the first 'TOWIE' cast member to ever take part in the show. Her catchphrases helped make 'TOWIE' such a success, but Amy decided to move onto pastures new in 2011. Since then she's posed for Vogue, made a splash with Jedward in the 'Celebrity Big Brother' house and earned over £2 million in endorsement deals. Mind you, we still remember her best for giving Sam Faiers a vajazzle in the first episode of 'TOWIE' back in 2010. Off the back of his successful appearance on 'I'm A Celeb' - where he famously revealed he couldn't tell the time, amid flirting with Amy Willerton - Joey bagged his own successful reality series, 'Educating Joey Essex' which is brought him all over the world. He's also still dating his fellow former 'TOWIE' cast member, Sam Faiers, who he reconciled with earlier in 2014. After walking out on her on-off boyfriend Mario Falcone for the last time and saying goodbye to 'TOWIE', Lucy has come the face of 'Results With Lucy' a fitness programme, while also taking part in the BBC gymnastics series, 'Tumble'. Since leaving 'TOWIE', one of the show's hottest ever hunks became embroiled in a two-week relationship with former-glamour-model-turned-bodybuilder Jodie Marsh. Their brief fling ended when she reportedly refused to have sex with him. Since then, explicit images of Kirk from a Skype chat have been posted online, which he has since apologised to the more faint-hearted among his fans. Whether she's slagging off her ex - Mark Wright - on Twitter, suffering a nip-slip in the 'CBB' pool or trying her hand at ice-skating in 'Dancing On Ice', notoriously publicity-shy Lauren \"The Goodge\" Goodger has rarely been out of the media since leaving 'TOWIE'. Earlier this year, she revealed her heartache after a six-second clip of her performing a sex act on her ex-boyfriend was circulated on mobile devices. After a long absence, Harry returned to 'TOWIE' in 2014, where his rocky relationship with Bobby Norris had us all talking, in particular about their unusual choice of swimwear. When they split up, it was announced that Harry wouldn't be returning for 'The Only Way Is Ibiza', as he wasn't involved in any of the show's key storylines anymore. Ouch. Charlie appears to divide his post-'TOWIE' time between going to the gym and taking his top off to take pictures of the effect this aforementioned gym time is having. Long may it continue, we say. Frankie's older sister quit 'TOWIE' in the summer, claiming the show was beginning to take over her life. Since then, she's had a difficult time of it, after being attacked by a group of girls in a night-club toilet while on a night out with Chloe Sims and Elliot Wright. Tom and Lydia Bright sadly split up not long after it was announced that they'd be leaving 'The Only Way Is Essex' to focus on their relationship. While Lydia has since returned to the show - and to her ex, James \"Arg\" Argent - former footballer Tom was recently spotted out and about with Lindsay Lohan at - you guessed it! - the Chiltern Firehouse. Danni took to her Twitter late last year to reveal she was \"taking a break\" from 'TOWIE' so she could focus on a \"business venture\". She gave birth to a daughter earlier this year, becoming the third member of the docuseries' cast to become a parent, after Dan Osborne and Billie Faiers. Mick quit 'TOWIE' because he feared the arguments that regularly took place at Sugar Hut - the nightclub that he owns - were putting people off going to his venue. He recently announced plans to branch out into the hotel business, revealing he's in the process of opening a luxury hotel in Essex. Listen carefully. S . Do you hear that? That, friends, is the sound of Maria Fowler Googling herself. Although she was famously branded an \"extra\" by Kirk during a heated row, Maria is rarely far from the headlines, thanks to her penchant for turning up to the opening of an envelope, and her rows with fellow Z-listers, including 'X Factor' singer Katie Waissel, 'Geordie Shore' star Vicky Pattison and Marcus Collins.  Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:36:20.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
