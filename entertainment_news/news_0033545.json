Read his Viral Facebook post By Mohammed Uzair Shaikh on October 18, 2015 at 2:17 PM Comments \nSrinagar, Oct 18: MBA pass out from Srinagar’s Islamic University of Science and Technology (IUST), Sameer Gojwari has refused to accept his degree from the Union Minister for Human Resource and Development (HRD), Smriti Irani citing the ‘diminishing freedom’ under the BJP government at Centre. To substantiate his controversial decision, Gojwari cited the current crisis in Sahitya Akademi where revered literary scholars are returning their awards to the government. \nThe Facebook post written by Gojwari in a casual manner on Friday turned viral after being appreciated by an unprecedented amount of social media users in the valley. Subsequently, the post even struck the mainstream media, showing the amount of disgust members of minority community have grown within themselves against the saffron party for the overt and covert support shown by it legislators and lawmakers to communal elements, especially after the Dadri lynching episode. \nHere is the controversial post of Sameer Gojwari which came up as a huge embarrassment for the HRD Ministry: \nWhen India’s writers are returning literary awards to protest diminishing freedoms and 41 writers across the country have given back most prestigious awards; unofficial reports say that ‪#‎IslamicUniversity‬ of Science & Technology on its 1st Convocation have chaired a Minister from Central Ministry ‪#‎BJP‬ most likely Mrs.Smiriti Irani. \nThough for a student receiving a master’s degree is no less than any prestigious award. But on 19th October 2015 (Convocation Day) I Sameer Gojwari won’t accept it. \nIn a follow-up post, he urged social media users to not to politicise his post and claimed that it was written by him in casual manner. \nQuite surprised to witness such a mega publicity on a simple status update. A personal opinion hits national stands in a jiffy… amazed. Don’t politicize the status update,The opinion is purely personal and stays one… \nThe situation has left the government red-faced. After dismissing the dissent of Sahitya Akademi awardees as vested political move, the current regime might be looking to find a malicious intent behind the student’s decision. \n  2:22 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T11:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:13:00.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
