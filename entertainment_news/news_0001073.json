The program Wednesday featured pieces by Handel, Bach and Vivaldi, music that the ensemble might have performed in its first years of existence.\nA little ironically, the H+H, as it is familiarly known, and once more or less devoted to the performance of new music, has now become a group that performs old music (mostly) in the “historically informed” manner, with a period-instrument orchestra and a compact chorus, 30 members strong here.\nHarry Christophers, an English conductor who specializes in early music performance, has been the society’s artistic director since 2009. He led the musicians with unfailing verve and precision Wednesday.\nA highlight of the concert came when concertmaster Aisslinn Nosky headed the orchestra and soloed in the “Summer” concerto from Vivaldi’s “The Four Seasons.” This was a turbulent reading, volatile in its contrast and exuberant in its rhythm. The orchestra dug in. Nosky vaulted about the stage, goading the group like a lead guitarist in a rock band. Some lapses in her intonation could be forgiven.\nShe had led up to “Summer” with an improvisational solo passage, connecting it with the preceding Concerto for Two Violins, Op. 3, No. 8, by the same composer – a nice and surprising touch. Susanna Ogata joined Nosky as soloist in the work, performed vigorously.\nThe first half opened and closed with coronation anthems, written for the 1727 coronation of King George II and Queen Caroline, by Handel. “Zadok the Priest” and “The King Shall Rejoice” revealed the chorus to be crisp and forceful, well-balanced and nimble in fugal passages. This celebratory music, which could have mired in its own pomp, remained a few feet above the ground.\nThe chief advantage of historically informed performance seems to these ears to be in rhythmic inflection and texture, giving the music life and clarity. Expressively, it can often sound like a bit of a dead end, though, every phrase carved out as with an X-Acto knife, set in high relief, with equal intensity. A performance can seem predetermined and academic.\nBach’s motet for double chorus and strings, “Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied,” at any rate, spun and spun, a whir of impressively intricate counterpoint that went nowhere. A translation of the text might have benefited the searching listener. The performance, however, was ever on its toes.\nPart 3 of Handel’s “Messiah” – the society has performed the work annually since the 1850s – ended the concert. The soloists – soprano Margot Rood, alto Emily Marvosh, tenor Stefan Reed and baritone David McFerrin – were all members of the chorus and splendid, particularly Rood, who sang her two arias with sweetness of tone and exceptional grace.\nThe chorus revealed a gift for speed and an enthusiasm for contrast, Christophers enforcing pugilistic accents. Trumpeter Jesse Levine made tidy work of “The trumpet shall sound” on an instrument without valves, some minor blemishes notwithstanding.\nContact the writer: 714-796-6811 or tmangan@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:32:39.634+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
