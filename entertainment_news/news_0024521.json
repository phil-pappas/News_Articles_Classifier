The two first met at Pride 32 with Henderson earning a unanimous decision over his Brazilian counterpart. Then, seven years later, at UFC Fight Night 32, Belfort scored one of the biggest victories of his career, knocking out Henderson with a vicious head kick.\nOn November 7, at the Ginásio do Ibirapuera in São Paulo, Brazil, Henderson will attempt to redeem himself after his devastating loss to Belfort two years ago. The 45-year-old multi-world champion enters UFC Fight Night 77 entirely focused on defeating the hometown MMA star. In a recent interview with MMA Fighting , Henderson dismissed talk of another title shot upon securing a victory over Belfort.\n\"Right now, I'm just focused on Vitor. If I beat him up pretty handily, I'm sure that helps. But at this point, the only thing I care about is beating Vitor. So, it doesn't matter to me (a title shot) other than me doing what I'm capable of with Vitor.\"\nHowever, Belfort sports heavy hands and boasts a 70 percent knockout rate. He is 10-3 in his last 13 fights, only losing in championship title fights to Anderson Silva, Jon Jones and Chris Weidman, respectively.\nHeading into this bout, a lot of controversy has surrounded Belfort, as he had been the recipient of Testosterone Replacement Therapy for years. This treatment, which elevates low levels of testosterone, was banned by the UFC in 2014. Therefore, according to Brett Okamoto of ESPN , “When Henderson ultimately accepted this fight against Belfort, Henderson said he was assured both he and Belfort would undergo random drug testing as part of the UFC's new anti-doping policy, which went into effect July 1. The program is spearheaded by the USADA.”\nGiven the new policy, Belfort and Henderson can rest assured knowing that both combatants will enter UFC Fight Night 77 sporting a clean bill of health; and while Henderson will seek redemption for his 2013 loss against his Brazilian foe, Belfort, on the other hand, will attempt to reign supreme in his home country and vie for his fourth UFC title shot since 2011.", "external_links": ["http://www.mmafighting.com/2015/10/16/9539589/dan-henderson-not-surprised-vitor-belfort-failed-drug-test-before-ufc", "http://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Vitor-Belfort-156", "http://espn.go.com/mma/story/_/id/13619688/usada-tests-dan-henderson-vitor-belfort-ahead-trilogy-fight", "http://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Dan-Henderson-195"], "published": "2015-10-26T04:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:57:20.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
