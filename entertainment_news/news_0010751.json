After it was reported that Clive Russell would reprise his role as Brynden Tully a.k.a. The Blackfish, latest news said Tobias Menzies would also return as Edmure Tully. Spanish site Los Siete Reinos was the first to report on Edmure's return as Menzies was reportedly seen filming for the show in Northern Ireland. The character was last seen in season 3 and has been held captive by the Freys since the Red Wedding. The latest tidbit confirms previous report that said the upcoming season would include a major Jaime Lannister ( Nikolaj Coster-Waldau ) storyline. The said storyline taken from the books will see Jaime and Bronn journeying into the Riverlands together. It appears that The Blackfish will be defending Riverrun from the Lannister's attack. While spoilers on the new season have been obtained from the set during the production, Amanda Peet who is married to \"GoT\" co-showrunner David Benioff said she couldn't make her husband spill the beans on Jon Snow's fate. \"I've asked for physical evidence that he's there, and that not only is he there,\" she told The Huffington Post. \"This is what I asked [Benioff] for: I was like: 'I will not divorce you. All I need is physical evidence that he's there, that he has dialogue and he's not just lying on a funeral pyre, and then I will stay married to you.' \" But Benioff \"just had a horrifying poker face,\" the actress said of her husband's response to her question. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T11:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:53:04.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
