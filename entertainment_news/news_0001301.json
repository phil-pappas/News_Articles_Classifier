Gimple issued a statement after a beloved, major character apparently died on Sunday's episode of AMC's zombie-apocalypse drama.\nSteven Yeun's good-hearted Glenn -- one of the few, original, remaining characters to make it to Season 6 -- was seen trying to reassure actor Michael Traynor's terrified Nicholas while the two stood on top of a dumpster, surrounded by thousands of hungry walkers. Seeing no way out, Nicholas shot himself in the head, falling into the crowd of zombies and taking Glenn with him.\nThe last shot of Glenn showed the hero screaming as walkers appeared to eat him.\nTalking Dead , AMC's Walking Dead analysis program, which features a weekly \"In Memoriam\" segment to honor those killed on the high-stakes drama, did not show Glenn in its weekly farewell, but instead concluded with the written message: \"Please don't let this be true. Please don't let this be true. Please don't let this be true.\"\nLater in the show, Talking Dead host Chris Hardwick read Gimple's statement regarding Glenn's likely death.\n\"Dear fans of The Walking Dead : This is a hard story to tell and when we were planning to tell it, we knew our friends at Talking Dead would be talking to you about it and knowing you would all be talking and feeling and commiserating, I knew we should say something about it, lest our silence say something we didn't mean to say or not say,\" Gimple explained. \"So, I'll say this: In some way, we will see Glenn -- some version of Glenn -- or parts of Glenn -- again, either in flashback or in the current story, to help complete the story.\"\nSunday's hourlong episode of The Walking Dead also ended on a cliffhanger with another original character, Rick played by Andrew Lincoln, trapped in a motor home with a bleeding hand and surrounded by zombies.\nNext week's episode will be 90 minutes long. Trailers for the upcoming series Preacher and Into the Badlands are scheduled to air during the broadcast.\n Kurtwood Smith joins the cast of 'Marvel's Agent Carter' Peter Capaldi to remain on 'Doctor Who' for at least a third season Bob Ross' first 'Joy of Painting' show is now on YouTube 'Sherlock' Victorian-era special gets title and air date", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/yBYYCuKkJU0", "https://facebook.com/unitedpress", "https://www.facebook.com/UnitedPress"], "published": "2015-10-26T13:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T12:33:43.249+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
