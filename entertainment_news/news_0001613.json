Metalachi, the world’s only hard rock Mariachi band, is one of six bands that will perform on the Main Stage during the inaugural three-day Oktoberfest that will begin at the San Bernardino County Fairgrounds on Friday. Oktoberfest will combine new and returning vendors and food stands, carnival rides, an artist showcase and contest, a Craft Beer Village, local entertainers and the “Desert’s Scariest Haunted House.” “Oktoberfest sounds like a great time and I will definitely throw the horns up for Metalachi,” said Chris Ackerman, 47, former lead screamer for a thrash-metal band. “I love when bands take the fusion route and produce great music.” Kicking off the event will be the tribute band Life in the Fast Lane - Songs of the Eagles, which will perform classic hits such as \"Take It Easy,\" \"Life in the Fast Lane\" and \"Hotel California.\" Also playing on opening night will be the tribute band Journey Unauthorized, which will play renditions of the Steve Perry Journey period, which also captures all the memories and excitement of the 1980s, according to the band’s website. On Saturday, the band Sounds of the ‘60s will share the stage with True Willie: The World’s most Authentic Willie Nelson Tribute. Organizers of the event said the Willie Nelson tribute band looks and sounds almost identical to the real Willie Nelson. Closing out the Oktoberfest on Sunday will be the band Big Bad Boogie Rock, which will perform just before Metalachi — a band that once auditioned for the TV show \"America’s Got Talent\" where all four judges voted “Yes.\" With band members that include Vega De La Rockha, Poncho Rockerfeller and El Cucuy, Metalachi will perform crowd favorites that include Ozzy Osbourne’s “Crazy Train,” Slayer’s “Reign In Blood,” Pantera’s “Cemetery Gates” and Guns N Roses’“Sweet Child of Mine.” Ackerman, a businessman who lives in Apple Valley, said Metalachi has followed the lead of bands such as Beatallica and Apocalyptica, which have found success with their unique musical mash-ups. “Beatallica has found a way to make beautiful music with Beatles and Metallica tunes,” Ackerman said. “Apocalyptica is a Metallica tribute band comprised of cellists who play a mix of genres like speed-metal, hard-rock and thrash-metal.” Also on Saturday, Heritage Victor Valley Medical Group’s Heritage Games will take place at the center. The event brings participants from local businesses, schools, gyms and public safety officials to compete in several sports. During the same evening, High School Madness will bring schools together as they compete during a pep-rally style competition. Other bands and attractions during Oktoberfest include hypnotist Mark Yuzuik, Chazz and his Jungle Drums, comedy magician Louie Foxx, Circus, Imagination, musician Jay Sooter, Merletallica, Southern Spirit and Polka Music (Friday and Saturday). The concerts are included with $5 admission. Unlimited single-day carnival rides are $20 and $15 presale. Fest-Pass tickets, which include admission and unlimited rides, are $23 and $20 presale. Parking is $5. Tickets can be purchased at the door or online at www.sbcfair.com . Oktoberfest is scheduled from 4 to 11 p.m. Friday, and noon to 11 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.
