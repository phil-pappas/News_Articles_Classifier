Ryan Thomas (Anthony Devlin/PA) \nThe 31-year-old said: “It has been a great privilege to be in Coronation Street for the past 15 years. The cast and crew are amongst the best in the business and to have had the chance to be a part of it for so long has been an amazing experience. \n“The decision to leave was an extremely difficult one but I felt that now was the right time to spread my wings and try other roles. \n“I’m just excited now to see what exit storyline the writers give Jason.” \nAt last week’s Pride of Britain Awards, Ryan hinted at his decision. According to the Daily Mirror, he said: “Going to Hollywood is a dream so I’m going to see what happens… We can always dream.” Ryan Thomas with the Duchess of Cornwall when she visited the Coronation Street set in 2010 (Andrew Yates/PA) \nAfter ITV confirmed the departure, producer Stuart Blackburn paid tribute to the star, whose final scenes will air next summer. He said: “Ryan has been an important part of Coronation Street for 15 years. We wish him every success when he moves on next year and we appreciate his desire to try new things.

He’s dated Sarah Platt (real-life former girlfriend Tina O’Brien), Candice Stowe (Nikki Sanderson), Violet Wilson (Jenny Platt), Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan), Maria Connor (Samia Ghadie) and Eva Price (Catherine Tyldesley). \nHis most prominent storyline was his marriage to Sarah in 2007, despite previously jilting her at the altar. But the relationship didn’t last.
