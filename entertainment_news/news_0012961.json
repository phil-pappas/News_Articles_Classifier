The bamboo business is highly specialized and the seller has built a great model, and team, that any true garden lover will be able to run and enjoy. Just last year they moved from the previous location to a new six plus acre site on a high traffic road. The new location has a great long term lease in place with favorable terms and the Seller has truly made this a special place to enjoy the bamboo shopping experience. When you see the website and my profile sheet you will see what I mean. So far this year sales continue to grow and the Seller expects this to be a banner year with the new location. This is truly a niche business that is making a lot of progress in the area with commercial landscapers, builders, and locals wanting to create the island experience at home. The business model makes revenue from retail sales, wholesale sales, installations, and maintenance of of bamboo for clients. The new location does offer 2700 sq ft building with plenty of parking, free wifi, with plenty of display settings to view the different bamboo options. It is grown right on site and will be sold with approximately 200k in retail priced inventory at time of sale but this is a moving target. The Seller wil stay on for a period of time to help with the transition and really wants to find a good fit who loves to get the hands dirty and grow things. The Seller also says that the new location is large enough that you could start to ship product from sales over the website which is another new revenue opportunity.
