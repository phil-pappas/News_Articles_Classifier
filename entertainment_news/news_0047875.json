Henry Cavill as Superman in Man Of Steel (Warner Bros) \nGeorge, who was previously in talks to direct a Justice League film in 2008, said: “There’s been some of that in the mix, but I’d say probably not true.” \nBut the 70-year-old Australian refused to rule out directing a movie in the DC Comics world in the future, adding: “I’m really interested in that world because I’m interested in mythology and their superhero movies are the equivalent of a modern-day incarnation of the Greek and Roman gods. \n“They’re exactly the same characters retold, and that’s always interesting.” \nIn the meantime, George has started developing ideas for a fifth instalment in the Mad Max franchise, following Mad Max: Fury Road, which came 30 years after Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome in 1985. \nDenying the film would be called Mad Max: The Wasteland, he explained: “We wrote deep back stories on all the characters and that was one of them, and it ended up virtually as screenplays without really intending to do that. Promoted stories \n“Talks are happening and beyond that, I can’t really give away the story right now. I always think you jinx the story if you talk too much about it before it is actually there.” Tom Hardy in Mad Max: Fury Road (Warner Bros) \nTom Hardy and Charlize Theron will reprise their roles as Max Rockatansky – the part previously played by Mel Gibson in the earlier three films – and Imperator Furiosa respectively in the next film. George Miller, Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy (Lionel Cironneau/AP) \n“Tom reminded me of Mel when he walked through the door. Tom was six weeks old when we first started shooting the first Mad Max but he had that same sort of charisma, that likeable persona with a volcanic quality,” George said. \n“Charlize, to me, is Furiosa. She was looking for something like this. She was an accomplished ballet dancer so she was used to the physical discipline and she wanted to do an action movie with not many words. Charlize Theron in Mad Max: Fury Road (Warner Bros) \n“She was so rigorous about it. There were days out there in the desert when I thought, ‘I’m glad she’s out there on our side.’ If there’s an apocalypse, I’d want her to be on my side.” Share article \nMad Max: Fury Road is out on DVD and Blu-ray on October 5.
