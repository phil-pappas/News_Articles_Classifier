Stillbirth and neonatal death charity Sands were also involved in the thorough research process.Jennifer Metcalfe, who plays Mercedes, commented: \"I'm honoured to have been given this storyline to raise awareness of such an important cause. Count the Kicks is a fantastic charity, which aims to teach expectant mothers about noticing changes in their pregnancy to reduce the risk of stillbirth. And working with Sands has helped me understand how Mercedes would cope with life after her baby has died.\"Mercedes has already been through so much tragedy in her life, but the death of her son will show a much more fragile side to her character. The scripts are brilliantly written by Anna Clements and with the help of the two charities, I was able to really understand what Mercedes is going through.\" © Lime Pictures © Lime PicturesMercedes struggles to cope Sands' bereavement support services manager Erica Stewart added: \"We're pleased to have been approached by the researchers and writers at Hollyoaks for advice and help to ensure that this heartbreaking storyline is portrayed truthfully and sensitively.\"Stillbirth is not rare and it's a tragedy that can happen to anyone. Sadly thousands of babies die each year in the UK. In 2013, over 100 babies every week were stillborn or died soon after birth.\"For a show like Hollyoaks with a youth focus to be covering this devastating experience is a brilliant way of raising awareness of the issues surrounding baby death among a younger audience who may have not otherwise come across them.\"Hollyoaks viewers will see the storyline begin on Tuesday, November 3 at 6.30pm on Channel 4.Read more Hollyoaks spoilers and newsDigital Spy Soap Scoop video - hit play below for gossip on EastEnders' Halloween special, Nikhil's Emmerdale return, the Nightingale family's arrival in Hollyoaks and a new romance story for Mary in Coronation Street. function onTemplateLoaded(experienceID) { bcExp = brightcove.getExperience(experienceID); modVP = bcExp.getModule(APIModules.VIDEO_PLAYER); modExp = bcExp.getModule(APIModules.EXPERIENCE); modCon = bcExp.getModule(APIModules.CONTENT); modVP.addEventListener(BCMediaEvent.BEGIN, onVideoStart); modVP.addEventListener(BCMediaEvent.STOP, onVideoStop); modVP.addEventListener(BCMediaEvent.PROGRESS, onVideoProgress); } #_containermyExperience4565610458001 { height: 100%; } // InSkin integration parameters: InSkinParams['myInSkin14565610458001'] = { 'srv_SectionID': '', 'srv_SectionIDPlay': '123757', 'srv_Keywords': '', 'plr_ContentID': 'myExperience4565610458001', 'plr_ContentType': 'BRIGHTCOVE3', 'plr_ContentW': 558, 'plr_ContentH': 314, 'plr_NoSkinContentResize': true, 'plr_NoSkinContentW': 618, 'plr_NoSkinContentH': 348, 'plr_NoSkinInSkinResize': true, 'plr_NoSkinInSkinW': 618, 'plr_NoSkinInSkinH': 348, 'plr_ResizeOnHideSkin': true, 'plr_HideSkinOnExternalAd': 'all', 'plr_ShowSkinAfterExternalAd': true, 'cnt_SmartPlayer': true }; // create the InSkin object: var InSkinObject4565610458001 = new InSkin.Base('myInSkin14565610458001'); brightcove.createExperiences(); if (!navigator.userAgent.match(/Android/i)) { InSkinObject4565610458001.init(); ai_type=\"video\"; } Get the Inside Soap magazine on your iPhone or iPad", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T12:17:41.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
