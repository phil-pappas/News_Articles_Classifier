The Broad Bay Church’s celebration of fierce and fragile women will continue Sunday, Oct. 25, at 10 a.m. with a worship service titled Fierce and Fragile Women: Stories of Biblical Heroines. \nFriday night’s concert is a fundraiser for New Hope for Women, an agency working to end domestic violence in Sagadahoc, Lincoln, Knox and Waldo counties. New Hope offers support and education to women, children and men affected by domestic violence, dating violence and stalking; and provides educational resources to assist our communities in creating a safer and healthier future. \nPax said she thinks of singing as painting with sound. A graduate of Temple University's College of Music, she attended the Georgia State University Summer Opera Workshop in Atlanta. She has twice been a participant at the Bel Canto Institute in New Palz, N.Y., and was selected for the Opera Studio at the American Institute of Musical Studies in Graz, Austria. She was guest artist at the University of Melbourne, Australia, where she performed a concert of American songs and taught a master class for voice students. Formerly on the voice faculty of Colby, Bates and Bowdoin colleges, Pax also has performed in concert in Maine, New York and in Europe. \nA Methodist pastor, Pax has been soloist, choir director and music director in churches in Maine and New York. She has designed and led retreats and worships, as well as producing numerous benefit concerts with both amateur and professional musicians. Since 1996, she has coached with Millard Altman, retired assistant conductor, coach and prompter of the Metropolitan Opera. \nSince last year, Pax has conducted a choir of about 40 at The Highlands Retirement Community in Topsham. Summer and winter concerts have featured songs in Zulu, Italian, Latin, Korean and English in a variety of styles, sung by participants from 70 to 92 years of age. \nHoward comes from Massachusetts. He studied music at Baldwin-Wallace College in Ohio, English literature at Bates College and education at the University of Maine. He particularly enjoys studying and performing music of past cultures, accompanying vocal soloists, a wide range of chamber music, and art history. Howard lives in Portland and has worked as a private and public school teacher and church organist. \nBroad Bay Congregational United Church of Christ, an open and affirming congregation, has supported New Hope for Women for many years. There is no charge for the concert, but donations will be accepted. \n“New Hope supports women where they are —whether fierce, fragile or both,” said Karen George, Broad Bay member and New Hope volunteer. \nThe Sunday service will be led by the Rev. Nancy Duncan, and cellist April Reed-Cox will provide music. For more information, email waldoucc@midcoast.com or call 832-6898. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
