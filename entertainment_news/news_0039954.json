Mine has been a mixed bag, wonderful time performing at gigs all across the country which, as you well know, I absolutely love! It’s fantastic getting to meet you all and say hi. You guys are all so friendly and welcoming and it’s a joy to get out and see you. As you know I had my fair share of negative comments towards me so it’s heart-warming to feel so much love and positivity. \nAnd on to the main event itself, this Sundays X Factor. I’m afraid after weeks of keeping schtum about the tedium and repetitiveness, the gloves are off. This week saw the turn of Nick Grimshaw to whittle down his band of hopefuls and it was a real chance for him to show his personality. All he made glaringly obvious is that he doesn’t have one. I have never seen a judge so far in the other judges pocket. All it took was a despairing word from Cheryl or withering look for Simon and Nick folded like a cheap picnic table. I’m not saying it’s an easy position to be in but please, someone give him an X-Ray, just to make sure the guy actually has a backbone! \nHe’s paid the big bucks to have a voice, an opinion and an impact on the hopefuls careers and he had none. If I was selected to be in Nick's team I think I would be running off to grab some friends, just to make sure I popped over to Cheryl’s camp instead! What a disappointment. How can you judge if someone else has the “X Factor” if it’s obvious you don’t have an ounce of it yourself! Promoted stories \nFor example, Tom Bleasby was ditched by Nick. I thought that was a bold move, and showed Nick wasn’t afraid to fly in the face of everyone else’s opinion, for a moment there was a glimmer of hope and then Rita chimed in “You’re Crazy”, the crowd yelled “Bring Him Back”, so guess what – he did! With all due respect, the crowd will always yell for the underdog and by complying Nick just proved to me that his seat on the panel is questionable to say the least. It may not be so simple for Tom to win out once Nick has a pal with an objective view when it comes to going into the judges houses in the following weeks, his voice definitely is an acquired taste. \nTo be fair, when the time comes to renew contracts for next year’s show (if there is one at this rate!), I don’t think Simon will be yelling “Bring Him Back” about Nick's contribution. Maybe if the public opinion is so important to Nick we should have our own Four Seat Challenge and see who we would pick as our Judge Dream Team? I imagine half the current panel would change! \nTo be fair, I think memorable male acts were thin on the ground, perhaps this explains some of Nick’s choices. Where Seann Miley Moore was an obvious choice, even though he looked like he actually forgot to get dressed for the performance, with his outstanding Shirley Bassey rendition, the others left much to be desired. There always has to be an “edited” villain at this stage and Mason Noise stepped up to fill the role with his ego fuelled behaviour leading to a falling out with Simon. The other acts seemed to be much of muchness, with no standouts for me at all. Seann must be kicking his 6in heels together with joy! \nI did laugh though, at Simon's “If you don’t get a seat I will eat myself” comment, referring to Simon Lynch’s performance. In a way it’s a pity he was voted through as I would have loved to have passed the ketchup to Simon! Also can we come up with better adjectives guys as if I hear Cheryl say “Slam-Dunked” one more time I will “Literally” scream! I feel like I’m watching High School Musical at times! \nSo Nick’s choices are made and next week we see how Cheryl gets on with her groups. Lots of girl bands to choose from though I don’t doubt the brilliant 4thPower will be joining Cheryl as Chez Nous, even if they are perkier than a Kitten on Valium! Tone it down girls – I mean, remember we can’t match your enthusiasm – especially if we have had to watch two hours of X Factor!
