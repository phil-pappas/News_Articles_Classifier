We want to hear it. The Armitized character designs are wonderfully over-the-top (think capital “A” anime), and it’s amusing to watch my heroes unleash spells like Ocean Blitz -- a pinwheel torrent of water resembling a hose turned on full blast --on enemies. This doesn’t mean that going super Saiyan on enemies is always the right approach. Zestiria does a nice job balancing the scales of combat by binding Artes to a series of gauges that, when depleted, must be refilled before you can use your skills again. Artes are also tied to a clever rock-paper-scissor mechanic that encourages you to adjust your battle plan according to an enemy’s particular strengths and weaknesses; no mindless spamming allowed. “ \nGetting ready for combat is almost as enjoyable as combat itself. Getting ready for combat is almost as enjoyable as combat itself. Zestiria’s customization is fairly deep, which makes dressing for battle fun. Each piece of equipment has four skill slots, three of which can be filled however you see fit, and items of the same type can be fused together to create powerful pieces that sport new and better skills that can be used in battle. I enjoyed mixing and matching my inventory and getting varying results, a process made easier by a skill sheet that shows you different ways to stack or arrange your skills for maximum benefit. A Forgettable Tale \nI wish I could be as enthusiastic about the story, but alas, I found it to be pretty weak. Despite an intriguingly cynical view on the human condition (some people are evil because of the strength of their convictions, not because they’re possessed by demons), the story never truly deviates from the typical trope of “young country boy is tasked with purging the world of malevolence.” The cast of characters also lacks a certain spark. Aside from the ever-earnest Alisha and the spunky, effervescent Rose, Zestiria’s heroes are fairly forgettable. \nAdvertisement < Previous Next > \nIt doesn’t help that the pace of the last act is dragged down by a lot of unnecessary backtracking. Zesitia’s handy teleportation system is constantly disabled to force you to hoof it from one end of a giant map to the other. It’s a royal pain, made worse when it’s all just to watch a 10-second cutscene that could have been triggered in a more efficient and enjoyable manner. \nHaving to traverse giant maps on foot is rough, but the good news is time flies a bit faster when playing with friends. Like in previous Tales, Zestiria features a local only four-player multiplayer option, something I think more RPGs should have. I had a good time coordinating attacks with my friends, even though the zoomed-out camera sometimes made it hard to see and character movements looked choppier than when playing alone. The Verdict \nTales of Zestiria doesn’t deviate too far from its competent predecessors, but it’s not a carbon copy, either. It may have linear dungeons and a less-than-stellar story, but it’s open-world exploration, enjoyable customization, and flashy new Armitization feature are enough for it to stand on its own.
