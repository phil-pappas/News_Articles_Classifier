Image 35 of 35 Burger Friday: Christian's Tailgate Downtown 1 / 35 Back to Gallery Houston burger stalwart Christian's Tailgate has just opened a big new downtown location at Congress and Fannin, near the courthouse complex. Burgers are just part of the extensive pub-grub menu, and the draft beer selection and late hours (midnight early in the week; 2 a.m. Thursday through Saturday) seem bound to make the spot a staple for nightcrawlers in an area where food options at that time are scarce. At lunch, it's already crowded with office workers and courthouse types.\nSo how's the famous burger, which — as Christian's website reminds us — has been \"voted best in Houston\"? Let's take a bite.\nRelated Stories Burger Friday: Southern Goods burger earns an \"enthusiastic A\" Burger Friday: Cottonwood's fare will transport you out of Houston ORDERING: Line up at the counter, place your order, and take your numbered flag to one of the tables in the dining room. Most of the tables are for parties of 6 or more, but solo diners can sit at the end of the bar counter or at counter seats at the far end of the dining room.\nPRICE: 1/3-lb \"small\" burger with French fries, $8.99; add cheese $ .75; substitute onion rings for French fries $1.00, for a burger total of $10.64\nARCHITECTURE : Salad stuff on top. Mayo goes on one side of the griddle toasted buns; mustard on the other. A thick patty at least an inch tall gets layered with pickle slices, rings of crisp white onion, sliced tomatoes and leaves of iceberg lettuce. The bun is the old-fashioned, non-poufy kind that squashes down so that despite the burger's height, you can eat it with two hands, as a sandwich. Hurray!\nQUALITY: Well, maybe not hurray. The aggressively seared patty on my burger was so dry and thoroughly cooked that I gave up eating it halfway through. I hadn't specified a degree of doneness, because I wanted to see what the default setting was at the new location. Default seems to be \"well done and a half.\" The sandwich has that classic Texas mustard/dill pickle leading edge, but there was no way around that desert-dry patty.\nOOZE RATING: Poor, as in nonexistent.\nGRADE: D. It pains me to report this, because I remember a time when I believed Christian's burger to be one of the city's best.\nBONUS POINTS: Some of Houston's best onion rings saved the day for me. They're the medium-cut kind with a thin, crackly coating that shatters apart in shards, and the onion-to-crust ratio is perfect. Substitute them for the French fries for a buck extra; it's worth it. While the fries are respectable, they are the sort that quickly lose interest as they cool, and their exterior texture is sort of one-note, without the snap and give and glaze I prize. A decent selection of draft beers is a nice feature, and it includes some local brews.\nLOCAL COLOR: The building in which Christian's has settled is an antique wonder of Corinthian columns on its facade and airy, graceful proportions inside. The vintage feel may be at odds with the no-nonsense rec room decor, with its pine paneling and beer signage, but the look is true to the Christian's icehouse spirit. There's a great mix of downtowners in attendance, from lawyers to jurors to junior executives on their way up, ties flung over one shoulder as they scarf up burgers at trenchermen's tables of six. My favorite seat is at the counter on the far end of the long dining room, with big windows that look out upon the old civil courthouse, a 1910 Beaux Arts granite structure that — like the facade at Christian's — is a remnant of another age.\nAs I ate my lunch, I watched a mounted policeman taking a break to let his horse have lunch on the courthouse grass.\nChristian's Tailgate Downtown: 1012 Congress, 713-229-8449.\nHours: 11 a.m.-midnight Sunday—Wednesday and 11 a.m.—2 a.m. Thursday—Saturday.", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/31/15/21/6607961/9/920x920.jpg",
