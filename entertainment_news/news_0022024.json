Photo: Rob Kelly \nIt's still 14 months away but Jerry Hall is bringing a farewell tour of The Graduate to Sydney.\nThe model and actress has been playing sultry Mrs Robinson, who seduces a young college graduate, around the world for more than a decade, including tours to Perth and Melbourne.\nShe is one of the producers of play, which opens at the Lyric Theatre on December 2 next year.\nHeading to Sydney: Jerry Hall and Tim Dashwood in The Graduate.

Photo: Karon Photographry \nThe NSW Minister for Trade, Tourism and Major Events, Stuart Ayres, said Destination NSW expected the show to deliver more than $1.6 million to the state's economy.\nThe production received tepid reviews when it ran in Melbourne two years ago, with The Age calling it \"an uneven blend of undercooked comedy and overdone melodrama\".\nWhile saying there were \"plenty of cheesy laughs\", The Herald Sun described the show as \"strangely unsatisfying â€“ and just a little bit tired\".\nThe late Wendy Hughes played the role in a Sydney production that was a box office disappointment, closing three weeks ahead of schedule, in 2001.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:12:38.329+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
