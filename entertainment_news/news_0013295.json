Show Caption Previous Next \nStrawberry the Australian Cattle Dog has been with the Arizona Humane Society (AHS) for almost two months and is still in search of her forever home. \nShe may be 8-years-old but definitely has not lost any of her upbeat spunk. She loves to go for long walks and explore anywhere and anything she can. If you are looking for the perfect hiking companion to tag along with you as we finally embrace the cooler weather, she’s definitely your girl! Not only does this sweetheart have a desire to discover, she also enjoys cuddling up and relaxing after a long day of fun – the best of both worlds! \nStrawberry is also already potty trained, leash trained, familiar with a doggie door, and likes to ride in the car. She can be a little timid when she first meets new people, so it will be best for her to meet any kids in her new home before being adopted to make sure it’s the perfect fit, human and canine alike! \nTo meet Strawberry , head on down to Campus for Compassion . Since she has been with AHS for some time, she is a Hopeful Heart dog and her adoption fee has been lowered to just $50. \nThis fee covers her spay surgery as well as her vaccines.
