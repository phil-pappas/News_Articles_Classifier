Forge Books, October 2015. 384 pages. $24.99 Boston author and Emmy-award-winning, on-camera investigative reporter Hank Phillippi Ryan’s new novel, “What You See,” is a fast-paced, tightly plotted thriller. She brings back likeable Jake Brogan and Jane Ryland — a homicide detective and TV reporter both working in Boston. In “What You See,” Jake is swamped. He’s got a John Doe who’s been stabbed to death languishing in the morgue, two more men beaten badly and a missing 9-year-old who may or may not have been kidnapped. By the time 48 hours and most of the book has elapsed, Jake can barely keep his eyes open. Boston PD is understaffed and overworked. The plot takes a long time to unfold and it’s a bit complicated. The Boston mayor’s chief of staff, Catherine Siskel, gets her daughter a job working in the City Hall surveillance room. Tenley is 19 and she has to watch a lot of screens directed on City Hall’s perimeter. She’s to save video of anything that looks significant. It’s boring work and Tenley, her father and mother are all grieving the recent loss of Tenley’s older sister Lanna, who died mysteriously in a park. The whole family is off-kilter and lost in their own worlds of grief. One day, just before her lunch hour, Tenley spots a commotion outside in the plaza. She decides to save video of the incident, a task that distracts her from observing the commotion herself. She goes to the plaza at lunch and checks out what’s going on. Before long, she’s in over her head. And then Tenley’s father goes missing. Jane, meanwhile, has quit her reporting job for ethical reasons and has taken some freelance TV work investigating the disturbance outside City Hall. She and Jake are an item, but it’s not easy because she has to report on events that Jake investigates. Once again she’s shadowing Jake and juggling the relationship. And then Jane’s sister Melissa reports that her soon-to-be stepdaughter, 9-year-old Gracie, has disappeared with Lewis, her fiancé’s ex-wife’s husband. We eventually learn a few disturbing things about Lewis and realize that Gracie is endangered. Jane decides to drop her freelance reporting work in order to help Melissa find Gracie even though she loves what she does and even though this is a rare opportunity to get back into the work she does well. But her pointed questions at just the right times advance all the related plotlines and aid Jake in his investigations. We suspect Jane won’t be unemployed for long despite the problems it causes for her relationship with Jake. Page 2 of 2 - The chain of evil-doing is intricate but easy to follow. Characters come on to the scene while others die off. Despite the rapid-fire chaos in this book, Jake and Jane provide a certain comforting balance. They are task-oriented, competent, generally upbeat and attractive in lots of ways. Three qualities stand out in “What You See.” First, the book is made up of many short scenes that jump into the action and out again, like TV. Some readers may feel right at home with the myriad shifts in point of view and action. Television is, in fact, the model the story’s structure most closely resembles. It makes sense: The author works in television. Second, each of the characters is skillfully animated with distinctive voices and character traits. Third, the revving up of plot takes a while. The characters do come to life, in time, and when they do, the book starts to get interesting.
