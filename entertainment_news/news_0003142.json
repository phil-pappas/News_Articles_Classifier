Jersey Devil sighting or elaborate Halloween prank? This video was taken by Emily Martin while she was in Leeds Point, the fabled birthplace of the Jersey Devil. \n\"You can't be sure what you're getting when you buy over-the-counter contact lenses, which can be very dangerous to your eyes,\" said Thomas Steinemann, spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthamology. \"If you want decorative contact lenses, get a prescription or steer clear of them. It's not worth the risk to your vision.\" \nA study of decorative lenses released last month found chlorine in three types of \"costume\" contact lenses. Iron was found in four types. The study was conducted in Japan, where the decorative lenses are a popular finishing touch to costumes. \nFour out of five brands of lenses examined in the study are not available legally in the United States because they lack approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. However, they may be available online, said the Academy in its warning, and often crop up for sale this time of year at beauty parlors and gas stations. \nKathleen O'Brien may be reached at kobrien@njadvancemedia.com .
