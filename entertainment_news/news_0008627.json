A core program of the Water Peace Project is to distribute Dr. Emoto’s children’s book, “Message from Water, Children’s Version,” to children across the United States.\nLindsay Kemp worked closely with Dr. Emoto until his passing last year, and in 2012, he appointed Kemp as the North America Director for the Emoto Peace Project. Kemp began the Water Peace Project as a platform to share her true passion, which is bringing forth Dr. Emoto’s Water Memory Theory to every segment of the public, be it through water conservation, water purification, or the education of how precious water is to all humanity.\nDr. Masaru Emoto, a New York Times bestselling author, was a pioneer in demonstrating the power of consciousness on how our thoughts negatively or positively effect our water. Emoto spoke at the The Spiritual Dimensions of Science and Consciousness Subcommittee, held at the United Nations NYC, for the International Decade for Action ‘WATER FOR LIFE’ 2005 – 2015 and had enjoyed support from celebrities such as Gwenyth Paltrow and Yoko Ono, in addition to many in the scientific and medical fields.\nProfessor Gerald Pollack, a Bioengineering Professor at University of Washington and Founder of the world’s leading Scientific Water Conference , said, \"Masaru Emoto’s Messages from Water have inspired many scientists to look seriously into the impact of subtle energies on water. Clearly, some impact exists, as multiple laboratories have confirmed, with a growing number of laboratories in hot pursuit of mechanistic details. We miss Emoto, and treasure the pioneering contributions that this great spiritual leader has brought to the world, especially the implicit challenge to scientists to understand the mechanistic basis of those messages from water.”\nDale Pond, an expert in Sympathetic Vibratory Physics at the Pond Science Institute , will be joining the Water Peace Project’s Scientific Advisory Council, and had this to say, “Dr. Emoto’s teaching that our thoughts and words do indeed affect elements such as water within our environment is an important principle long forgotten but now being resurrected throughout society - especially within children. We can thank Dr. Emoto for spearheading this principle with children around the world. They are, after all, our future.”\n“I am truly grateful to be working with Lindsay Kemp of Water Peace Project to provide children with Dr. Emoto's book \"Message from Water, Children's Version,\" said Richard Wyzanski, a vibroacoustic sound therapist based in southeast Florida, who is also involved. Wyzanski went on, “Dr. Emoto children’s book is dedicated to the EMOTO Peace Project to teach children the importance of water's true nature with the hope that the future will be turned into a peaceful world filled with love and gratitude.”\nThe matching gift campaign, WE ARE WATER, will kick off on the anniversary of Dr. Emoto’s passing, Saturday, October 17th. The campaign aims to raise an additional $100,000 by the end of the year to fund the distribution of The Message from Water to private and public schools in California, Florida, New Jersey and New York beginning in 2016.\nFor more information and to donate to the Water Peace Project, visit http://www.waterpeaceproject.org .
