Scottish prosecutors: 2 Libyans are Lockerbie bomb suspects FILE - In this Dec. 22, 1988 photo the nose section of Pan Am Flight 103, a 747 airliner dubbed \"The Maid of the Sea,\" lies in a field outside the village of Lockerbie, Scotland. Scottish prosecutors said Thursday, Oct. 15, 2015 they have identified two Libyans as suspects in the 1988 bombing of a passenger jet over the town of Lockerbie, and want to interview them in Tripoli. Scotland’s Crown office said that Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland and U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch had agreed “that there is a proper basis in law in Scotland and the United States to entitle Scottish and U.S. investigators to treat two Libyans as suspects in the continuing investigation into the bombing of flight Pan Am 103.” (AP Photo/Martin Cleaver, File) Most Read", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:32:03.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
