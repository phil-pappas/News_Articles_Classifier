That’s not a negative. Finding its place can be an exciting time for the chef and her crew to experiment. Getting to where they’re going could be lots of fun, for them and for diners.” \nI wasn’t the first person to point out that some niche carving was needed. Food Network’s Robert Irvine devoted a \"Restaurant Impossible\" show to his ideas for repositioning the restaurant. That Irvine is a television personality doesn’t mean he has all the answers or even good ideas. What he did may have been good for a half hour on television, but it wasn’t so good for Coach Lamp. After a couple of visits following my review, I sensed that owner Bill Darling and Chef Christine Williams weren’t enjoying the process of finding their place and that diners weren’t having much fun along the way. \nMore than a few tweaks were needed. I think Darling and Williams saw the writing on the wall of 751 Vine Street. They could have packed up the kitchen, poured the last drinks and closed the doors, but they didn’t. I don’t know if the new name, Brooke & Billy’s Bites Bourbons & Brews, sparked the new menu or vice versa. I was curious enough to check out how successfully the restaurant was reinvented (If you’re curious about Brooke, she’s Billy’s daughter.). \nI wouldn’t pigeonhole Brooke & Billy’s as a bar even though the bar is the first thing you see when you walk in the door, and the bar has retained its character as a bar with a past. In my opinion, that can be the best kind of bar, although I’m not one to snub a new bar. A long list of bourbons and a solid beer portfolio show that Bourbons & Brews isn’t part of the name for no reason. Review | Food at Fontleroy's has inspired moxie \nWilliams was smart to design a new menu that doesn’t overreach or overdo. Her offering of salads, appetizers, burgers, sandwiches and a few “big bites” is well developed and nicely executed. Chili has its own spot on the menu. It’s meaty with just enough spiciness to be interesting. Don’t make my mistake of ordering only a cup ($4.99). Spend another $2 for a bowl. And let them pile it high with onions, cheese and banana peppers. \nThere are eight “bites,” including crispy pork rinds ($5.99), chicken fingers in a bourbon glaze ($7.99) and a daily flatbread ($8.99). Thai chili sauce jacked up another appetizer, pork spring rolls ($6.99), with extra flavor. They were excellent. I wasn’t as pleased with the buffalo chicken wontons ($6.99). The chicken was flavorful in a predictable buffalo-spiced way but didn’t stand up to the bulk of the deep-fried wontons. The blue cheese dip was runny and too heavy with what tasted like a heavy hand with celery seed. \nChipotle chicken mac ‘n cheese ($12.99) made the chicken work for attention. This time the chicken held its ground. Bacon bread crumbs balanced the kick of the chipotle cheese sauce, although I thought the kick was great. \nAlso part of the “big bites” are fried chicken and macaroni and cheese ($11.99), hot roast beef sandwich with mashed potatoes ($14.99) and the breakfast brown ($14.99), a Hot Brown sibling that bucks tradition with the addition of a fried egg. \nThe rich and dribbly eggstra ordinary burger ($10.99) was grilled medium-rare and was super-embellished with a sunny-side-up egg, jalapeño cheese, bacon, pico de gallo, lettuce and tomato. It won us over but the bacon and bleu burger ($9.99) or the bbq burger ($10.99) with pork, jalapeño and Havarti cheese are on our to-do list of burgers. Last fall, I couldn’t get enough of Coach Lamp’s pork belly. I’m glad to see it’s on Brooke & Billy’s menu in the form of the belly burger ($10.99). It’s waiting for me, and I for it.

A portobello mushroom stuffed with red peppers, spinach and mozzarella on brioche; vegetarian flatbread; and a veggie burger (all $8.99) take their place among four salads ($4.99 - $8.99) and a triple grilled cheese ($7.99). \nYou never know what will be the dessert of the day. If it’s your lucky day, it will be the Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup cookie with ice cream and chocolate syrup served in a cast-iron skillet. \nThere are still enough warm days and evenings to take advantage of Brooke & Billy’s patio. It’s an inviting space for casual and friendly alfresco dining and drinking. When the weather becomes too cold to sit outside, Brooke & Billy’s will be a welcoming place to warm up. \nYou can email Nancy Miller at millermadison@aol.com . \nBROOKE & BILLY’S BITES, BOURBONS AND BREWS \nAddress: 751 Vine St.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T18:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:49:17.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
