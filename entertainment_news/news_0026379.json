She halted her attendance at the school during fall of 2014, before her DUI arrest and later temporary psychiatric hold.\nIn November 2014, the child star revealed on Twitter she had been diagnosed bipolar and manic depressive. \"I'm seeing my psychologist and psychiatrist weekly so I'm fine,\" she said.\nMost recently, Bynes was spotted on a shopping trip in West Hollywood, during which she sought asylum from paparazzi from inside a police station.\nPolice told E! News at the time Bynes was \"concerned for her physical welfare,\" and walked in on her own, leaving the station without an escort after receiving tips on how to avoid the avid photographers.\n Iggy Azalea rejects Rita Ora's 'Lady Marmalade' collaboration idea on Twitter Playboy magazine to end nude photos in 2016 Salma Hayek talks gender equality in Hollywood: 'Time to really define who we are'", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/amandabynes/status/529551925008551936", "https://facebook.com/unitedpress", "http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/amanda-bynes-goes-back-to-school-at-fidm-parents-are-so-proud-20151210", "https://www.facebook.com/UnitedPress", "http://www.people.com/article/amanda-bynes-taking-classes-at-fidm-again"], "published": "2015-10-13T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:36:08.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
