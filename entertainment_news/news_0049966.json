It has been a weird year and this tops it! #GBBO meets @DalaiLama Birthday cake for His Holiness. pic.twitter.com/jJjq4Y6hhN \n— Ian Cumming (@iancpix) September 21, 2015 \nHonestly, no-one could quite believe it. Ian casually made an 80th birthday cake for the Dalai Lama with no explanation given. Like it's an everyday occurence? #casual #GBBO \n— Alana Irwin (@Alana_IrwinX) October 7, 2015 Was the fact that Ian made a cake for the Dalai Lama thrown in at the end there to check if people were still paying attention? #GBBO \n— Claire Briscoe (@ClaireLBriscoe) October 7, 2015 OF COURSE IAN MADE A CAKE FOR THE DALAI LAMA. OF COURSE HE DID. #GBBO \n— Louise Jones (@louisejonesetc) October 7, 2015 The other losing #GBBO contestants were happy to continue baking for their families. Not Ian. He had to bake the Dalai Lama's birthday cake. \n— Iain Lobban (@ilobb1) October 7, 2015 IAN HAS MADE A CAKE FOR THE DALAI LAMA FORGET ITHe is the JLS of Bake Off, its always the second placers that are the real champs #GBBO \n— Uncle Nicky (@YEPIMNICK) October 7, 2015 \nThis led some people to question whether Nadiya was the real winner. Ian's made a cake for the Dalai Lama, Nadia has been baking for friends & family. Who really won? #GBBO \n— Tom Williams (@Williamsss7) October 7, 2015 Well I think we can say Ian was the real winner of #gbbo given he baked a cake for the dalai lama! #greatbritishbakeoff \n— talisker donahue (@taldonahue) October 7, 2015 \nAnd the jokes began. Ian from #GBBO : So, Dalai Lama, what kind of cake would you like for your 80th birthday?Dalai Lama : Make me one with everything. \n— Tom Miles (@tigre_facile) October 7, 2015 Ian is a bit like that bloke off The Fast Show \"…and then I made a birthday cake for the Dalai Lama….which was nice!\" #GBBO \n— Garry Smith (@Garrygen) October 7, 2015 Tamal passed his medical exams. Mat became a dad. Ian made a cake for the Dalai Lama. This show could end war in the Middle East #GBBO \n— Kris Holt (@KrisHolt1) October 7, 2015 \nBut let’s not forget some of the other contestants. \nStu has started a blog and been awarded his first gold disc in music. Marie baked a 3ft robot for her son’s 40th birthday. Dorrett has received her first cake commission. Sandy’s in chats with the council to teach West Yorkshire how to cook. \n— Stu Henshall (@stu_henshall) October 7, 2015 \nUgne’s in training for a huge body-building tournament next year. Alvin’s been whipping up treats for charity while waiting to do a patisserie course next year. Arm wrestle @PaulHollywood ?!? Hahahaa… Great final #GBBO Amazing memories,beautiful people… pic.twitter.com/diCBWs5JcT \n— Ugne Bubnaityte (@Ugne_Bakes) October 7, 2015 \nMat has moved house – and become a dad! Paul’s called the “Baking Governor” at work. Flora’s started her History of Art and Maths degree. The bun is finally out of the oven, he's a small fella with big hands! How long before he's kneading bread? pic.twitter.com/mJDqLkUxQ6 \n— Mat Riley (@matrileybakes) September 28, 2015 \nTamal passed his medical exams and is now making wedding cakes for friends. Nadiya is working on a lychee cheesecake recipe. To my darling favourite lady @BegumNadiya , I could not be more proud. Lots and lots of love always. #gbbofinal pic.twitter.com/YBEtMAFDj5 \n— Flora Shedden (@florashedden) October 7, 2015 Share article \nAnd, once again, Ian only went and baked a ruddy birthday cake for the Dalai Lama. (He still forgot to put sugar in an iced bun though.)
