Murphy They found a dead body on the Truman Parkway the other day. Did you hear about it? Perhaps you did, and perhaps you didn’t. The man’s name was Romell Stephens. But perhaps that small detail of the dead man’s name got lost in the hail of gunfire that seems to dominate Savannah area news reports lately.\nThere were shootings during the last few weeks in Yamacraw Village, in Cuyler-Brownsville, and in downtown Savannah. And while the police are doing their best to bring the perpetrators to justice, sometimes it just seems like crime has spiraled out of control in our city.\nIn 2014, there were 33 violent deaths in Savannah. Seven of these victims were children. There were 198 shootings overall — 35 more than in 2013. Overall, violent crime in 2014 increased 8.8 percent over 2013. By all indications, the numbers in 2015 are on pace to outstrip those figures. But where does Savannah stack up relative to everyone else in that regard?\nAccording to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Registry, the annual murder rate in U.S. metropolitan areas is 4.5 murders per 100,000 residents. Savannah averages 9.8 annual murders/100,000—roughly double the national average. By comparison, Atlanta’s rate is 5.5; New York City’s is 3.9. Charleston, our mirror city in the Palmetto State, averages 7.2. To be certain, we are nowhere near the top of the list — St. Louis, at 50, and Detroit, at 44, are the hands-down winners here — but people don’t generally plan vacations to St. Louis and Detroit.\nSavannah is a tourist town. We had a record 13.5 million out-of-town visitors in 2014. Those tourists spent $2.5 billion dollars, driving profits in our hotels, restaurants and shops. The Savannah tourism industry employs over 24,000 people. Its impact cannot be underestimated. Conde Nast has consistently chosen Savannah as one of the top 10 tourist destinations in the country — which is why Savannah simply cannot allow itself to be defined by its crime problem.\nSo how do we fix this?\nPart of the answer is obvious: we need to hire more policemen. The numbers speak for themselves: our police force is down an estimated 80-120 officers from where it needs to be. There was tremendous attrition during and after the Willie Lovett debacle, when Savannah’s Chief of Police was involved in felonious activities that ultimately resulted in a prison term. The pervasive corruption in the Lovett administration resulted in cover-ups of the questionable activities of former Counter Narcotics Team officer Malik Khaalis and Star Cpl. Willet Williams and the subsequent characterization of the SCMPD’s Internal Affairs Department as “inadequate” by an outside consulting firm.\nThese events have subsequently been directly tied to a number of lawsuits against the city and county by former SCMPD officers — the latest being filed just last week. We are finally addressing this shortfall by actively trying to hire more policemen — but that will not resolve the manpower shortage overnight. In the short term, we could get help from the GBI, the Georgia State Patrol and the Sheriff’s Department. We need to pull on all of these resources in order to get a handle on our current crime surge.\nMore community-based policing is another element which should be emphasized. All too often, crimes in Savannah go unsolved because witnesses are afraid to step forward due to fears of retaliation. Having police support that can be trusted by the residents of our higher-crime communities can go a long way towards rectifying this problem. Targeting the major perpetrators of crimes in these areas, such as street gangs, can be very helpful. The recent “Ceasefire in Savannah” initiative, spearheaded by police Chief Joseph Lumpkin, Sr., is a step in the right direction.\nUltimately, however, Savannah needs something more fundamental: a change in our community’s culture. We must, at all levels, have zero tolerance for crime. Fabrication of excuses for criminal behavior — on any basis — cannot be allowed. In the wake of recent events in Ferguson, Mo., Charleston and Baltimore, it has become fashionable to vilify the police. Policemen have even been murdered simply because they were wearing the blue uniform. This sort of blanket characterization is not only unfair, but grossly counterproductive. Public safety is a vast community benefit. It helps all of us. The alternative is anarchy, a “Wild West” environment where disorder rules and evil prospers.\nSo let’s be very blunt here: Our policemen are a vital part of our community. They put their very lives on the line for us every day. They deserve our respect and support. In turn, however, the police must recognize the need for building an element of trust with the community. Effective law enforcement demands it —and this will take time. I do get the sense that Chief Lumpkin understands this; indeed, in the Athens/Clarke County area, where he was Chief of Police for years before coming to Savannah, the annual murder rate during his tenure was 1 per 100,000 — one-tenth of Savannah’s average. I am hopeful that his Athens track record will ultimately translate into similar gains in Savannah. But that will require the support of our elected leadership — and having city “leaders” who allegedly brandish firearms to try to intimidate their electoral opponents is something that none of us should tolerate. That sort of dysfunctional behavior needs to be rewarded with negative returns in the voting booth.\nWe live in a beautiful, historic city, a city filled with myriad cultural amenities that are the envy of other similar-sized communities across the nation. But we have an ugly crime problem that mars the visage of the “pretty lady with the dirty face.”\nCan we tame the burgeoning crime wave in Savannah?\nI think we can. In fact, I know we can — but it will take lots of work. It will take increasing the size of our police force. It will require cooperation from the community. It will mandate that we elect effective leaders who will support the police as they attempt to do their job. In the end, however, this sort of collaborative effort will be rewarded with Savannah becoming a safer place to live.\nAnd that, ladies and gentlemen, will benefit each and every one of us.\nMark Murphy, M.D. is a Savannah physician and writer.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14760134_0.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14760134_0.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T20:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:38:05.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
