Reservations are suggested; call Richard S. Scarsella, WHMHS president, at 330-726-8277. \nFarragher is a Youngstown native who lives in Canfield. He is a graduate of South High School and Ohio Wesleyan University. \nHe pursued graduate studies at Kenyon College, where he was a Rockefeller Scholar, and the University of Madison, where he was a teaching assistant. \nHe was director of marketing for both Youngstown Sheet and Tube and Magnecord Corp., and marketing manager for McDonald Steel Corp. He also was president and owner of Farragher Marketing Communications and professor of marketing at what in now Youngstown State University. \nFarragher is most popularly known for the iconic design and implementation of a marketing campaign centered upon the Youngstown Sheet and Tube trademark, which encompassed an open-hearth blast furnace orange and black bucket, similar to one used in the steel-making process. \nThe symbol is now used by the Youngstown Steel Heritage Museum.
