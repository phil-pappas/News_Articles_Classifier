Eddie Brock, had another opinion. In a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter to talk about his movie \" Truth \", the 37-year old actor defended both \"Spider-Man 3\" and filmmaker Sam Raimi. Grace said that there were some positive sides from the aformentioned movie, though it was often regarded as Raimi's weakest film in the original trilogy. When asked about his opinion on the final result of the movie, the actor said, \"I know the movie did well for Sony, but I also know a lot of people weren't happy with it.\" He went on praising the director while also linking Raimi's directorial gig with the idea of \"running a small country.\" \"I think Sam is so talented. This summer, there was a movie like that where people are just slamming a big studio movie. I would love to see anyone who's slamming one of those movies try to fit in Sam Raimi's position,\" Grace said. \"He was like the president of a small country - by the way, ['Spider-Man 3'] had the gross national income of a small country, too. I have huge respect for him. I think, on a whole, he did such a fantastic job [on that trilogy].\" \"Spider-Man 3\" was released in 2007. It might have a weak performance, but it grossed $336 million domestically for an impressive global total of $891 million. Fans can expect another version of the wall-crawler in an untitled new Spider-Man movie , which will hit U.S. theaters on July 28, 2017 with Tom Holland starring as the wall-crawler. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Spider-Man 3 News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T07:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:29:19.078+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
