He was supposed to do a movie with NTR, but the buzz says that the director is planning to do something different from the usual.\nThere was news about NTR-Koratala movie being formally launched on the auspicious occasion of Vijaya Dasami. And as per sources from the industry, Koratala Siva has denied the news and said that he is yet to decide about his next movie.\nAfter doing his first two films with Prabhas and Mahesh Babu, now Siva wants to do a film with a hero who doesn't have any image. And it is said that Koratala is planning to do his third film with Akkineni Akhil. He'll surely make a movie with NTR, but it may take some time before he prepares subject for the Young Tiger.\nBut NTR on the other hand is very much interested in teaming up with Siva for his next. Recently, he watched Srimanthudu and appreciated Mahesh and Siva's work in the film.\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-03T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:18:34.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
