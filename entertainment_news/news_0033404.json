Hills and DePoy first began performing together in Belfast in 2003 and now play an average of 250 concerts a year, from Maine to Florida. They draw on the rich music traditions of the Shenandoah Valley including bluegrass, classic country, old-time string band, blues, rural swing and gospel. With spontaneous and often amusing stage banter and steeped in the tradition of improvised performing art, Me & Martha creates a space where everyone can experience musical art as an unfolding story. \nMe & Martha is a member of America’s Old-Time Country Music Hall of Fame and on the artist rosters for Young Audiences of Virginia and the Virginia Commission for the Arts as traditional musicians. They organized and manage the Shenandoah Music Trail, a 501(C)(3) nonprofit corporation dedicated to promoting and preserving the valley’s music, providing an economic opportunity to bring together musicians and audiences. \nDePoy is a fifth-generation music maker from the Shenandoah Valley and a retired college professor. He holds a master’s in education and a doctorate specializing in American Music and Popular Culture. Hills is a retired early childhood educator. Both are music historians, specializing in The Great American Song Book that includes a body of music from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, as well as popular songs from the 20th century. \nAll ages are invited to enjoy Me & Martha’s entertaining, often funny and surely educational presentation of an authentic, uniquely American music. Doors will open at 2:30 p.m. For more information, call the library at 338-3884. For more information about Me & Martha, visit meandmartha.com . \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
