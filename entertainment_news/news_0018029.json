I don't believe we're too far off from pumpkin spice-scented DVDs and CDs available on store shelves. \nHalloween does that to consumers, as companies seem to fill that need to feel like fall when we were kids, many of us growing up up North. \nOne part of Halloween that doesn't thrill me is the ultra-horror flicks so prevalent nowadays. I enjoy your basic scary films (\"Scream\") but I'm no fan of people being chopped up with chain saws or chased by a grinning doll wielding a knife. \nSo if those movies are your things, you're in luck because those and a few others are now out on DVD and at Redbox. \nRELEASED THIS WEEK \nDVDs \n\"Paper Towns\" — Based on novel by John Green (\"Fault In Our Stars\"), the film focuses on two young neighbors who share a traumatic experience and years later are reunited and join for a series of events. \nOther DVDs out now include: \"Jurassic World,\" \"Testament of Youth,\" \"The Vatican Tapes,\" \"Z for Zachariah,\" \"King of the Hill: Season 13,\" \"Nurse Jackie: Season 7,\" \"Peaky Blinders\" and \"Wolfpack.\" \nNew at Redbox \nMovies: \"Pitch Perfect 2\" — An a cappella group performs at the Lincoln Center for the President of the United States. What could go wrong? A sequel to the 2012 hit film. \nOther films include: \"Tomorrowland\" \nVideo games — Adventure Time: Finn and Jake Investigations \nNetflix: \n\"Results\" — A 2015 independent romantic comedy, starring Guy Pearce, Cobie Smulders, Brooklyn Decker and Giovanni Ribisi. The film is set in Austin, Texas, and looks at the relationship between money and happiness — and also is about relationships, the personal kind. \nAlso new on Netflix this week: \"Ain't Them Bodies Saints,\" Lego DC Comics: Batman Be-Leagured,\" \"Marvel's Avengers Assemble: Season 2,\" \"Results,\" \"Hemlock Grove: Season 3\" \nOUT FRIDAY \nAlbums \n\"Storyteller\" — Carrie Underwood. Her fifth studio album, the lead single \"Smoke Break\" was released in August and moved quickly up the country charts. \nOther new albums out include: \"Sounds Good Feels Good\" by 5 Seconds of Summer and \"Another Country\" by Rod Stewart \nCOMING NEXT WEEK \nNetflix \n\"The Gunman\" — Sean Penn stars in this thriller about a man haunted by his past, being hunted down for something he did as part of his job as a mercenary. Critics weren't thrilled with this Penn effort but I liked it, as it offered moral undertones and great action shots from throughout the world. \nAlso out next week: \"Walt Disney Animation Studios Short Films Collection,\" \"August: Osage County,\" \"Manson Family Vacation \nLeaving Netflix next week: \"Nanny 911: Season 1\" (leaves Sunday); \"Bratz: Genie Magic\" (leaves Monday); \"Alexandria\" (leaves Tuesday); \"America's Sweethearts\" (leaves Thursday) \nDVDs \n\"Jurassic World\" (shot in 3D) — The continuation of the franchise, only with better and cooler computer animation. \nOther DVDs released next week: \"The Vatican Tapes Suspense,\" \"Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection ‘F' Animation,\" \"The Wolfpack Documentary,\" \"Chloe & Theo Drama\" and Z for Zachariah\" \nRedbox \nFilms at Redbox soon include: \"Spy,\" \"Pixels,\" \"Poltergeist,\" \"Entourage: The Movie\" Copyright 2015 Journal Media Group.
