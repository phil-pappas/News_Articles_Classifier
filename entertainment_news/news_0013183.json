But during a marathon session Oct. 8 that included emotional testimony from supporters and opponents of the plan, the panel added a last-minute condition that SeaWorld stop breeding whales and import no new whales.\nSeaWorld officials complained that the conditions would mean that its killer whale show would eventually end when all of the orcas died in captivity.\n\"It simply defies common sense that a straightforward land-use permit approval would turn into a ban on animal husbandry practices -- an area in which the commission have no education, training or expertise,\" Joel Manby, president and chief executive of SeaWorld Entertainment said in a statement.\nAlliance of Marine Mammal Parks & Aquariums issued a statement in support of SeaWorld, saying the condition \"sets a very dangerous precedent not only for SeaWorld, but for the entire zoological community, and SeaWorld is right to challenge it.\"\nSeaWorld Entertainment did not say when the lawsuit would be filed.\nA spokeswoman for the Coastal Commission said the agency had no comment.\n(c)2015 Los Angeles Times\nVisit the Los Angeles Times at www.latimes.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1738483", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1738483&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1738483&h=SeaWorld+to+sue+California+Coastal+Commission+over+orca+restrictions"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:10:40.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
