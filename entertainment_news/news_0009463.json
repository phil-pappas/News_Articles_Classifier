That pass comes with free parking and unlimited downloads of park photos. \nDisney spokeswoman Suzi Brown told the Los Angeles Times a restricted version of the pass sells for $849 but has two weeks of blackout days, including the Christmas and New Year's holiday seasons, the park's most popular dates. The park says the move is meant to prevent overcrowding. \nPrices of most other annual passes also went up. \nThe anytime-anywhere pass, good any day at parks in Anaheim, California, and Florida, rose 31 percent to $1,439. \nParking went up $1 to $18, but the single-day admission price of $99 remained the same.
