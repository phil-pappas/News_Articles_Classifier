To whet the appetite, Bulletin Entertainment gathered facts on the film during its grand press conference held at Manila Hotel recently. Mabuhay ang pelikulang Pilipino!\nDennis Trillo as Felix Manalo Raymond Bagatsing and Alice Dixson as Carling and Lilia Mylene Dizon as Bonifacia Manalo-(Ysagun) Mozo Gabby Concepcion as Eraño Manalo Jackie Woo as a Japanese general YUL SERVO as Clemente Mozo RICHARD YAP as Glicerio Santos PHILLIP SALVADOR as Rev. Emmanuel Tanco\n1. The size of the “Felix Manalo” cast is so big (7,000) that costume designers worked on dressing up anywhere from 200 to 1,000 actors and bit players every day. A production staff also had to do “roll call” unless someone gets left out in shoots, particularly in staging the election scene and grand funeral scene.\n2. The hair and makeup artists have had to work on several looks since “Felix Manalo” is set from the 1880s to the 1960s. It is said that “Felix Manalo” is monumental as it traces the origins and growth of the INC since 1914. It painstakingly covers and replicates events and locations as early as 1886 when Ka Felix was born until his demise in 1963.\n3. Raw footage of the movie reached 65 terabytes. The bioflick has 142 visual effects shots.\n4. The video editor had a challenging time “balancing” exposures among named actors in the cast. He said that everytime the script was revised, he’s had to review the entire film from the start for continuity purposes. The running time of all unedited scenes total 7 hours.\n5. “Felix Manalo,” being a period film, has no room for the sound of automobiles in some of its scenes. The cast and crew has had to time the shoot so no sound of vehicles (buses, tricycles) would be heard in the background. No “modern” sound, as they put it.\n6. The theme song of the movie was sung by Sarah Geronimo.\n7. The cost of making “Felix Manalo” is said to be at least P150 million. .\n8. Part of the research into Dennis Trillo’s character had the actor listening to audio recordings of Felix Manalo, INC’s First Executive Minister. Religious affiliation aside, Dennis said the movie underscores hope, inspiration and integrity.\n9. There are plans to screen “Felix Manalo” in North America, Europe and other parts of Asia.\nThe Iglesia Ni Cristo (INC) said they need not oblige their members to watch the film because they all want to do so and have even clamored for holding advance ticket selling to avoid long lines on opening day and during its entire run.\n11. There are many INC members in the cast, including Jaclyn Jose, Snooky Serna, Gladys Reyes, Ruru Madrid, Mike Magat and Jon Lucas. There are also non-INC members, two being Dennis Trillo and Gabby Concepcion.\n12. Cast member Dennis Coronel said doing the film led him to read the Bible for the first time.\n13. Before being shot as a movie, there were plans to make “Felix Manalo” into a TV series and stage play.\n14. “Felix Manalo” aims for two Guinness Book of World Record titles on Oct. 4 at the premiere: largest audience for a film screening and largest audience for a film premiere. The Philippine Arena will be converted into a giant film theater with a screen that measures 120 meters by 40 meters. To maximize the theatrical experience, a 5.1 Dolby surround audio system will be set up.\n15. “Felix Manalo” is a biographical-historical drama. “Sinundan ang buhay (ni Felix Manalo) mula ipinanganak hanggang siya’y namatay at sa pagbubuo nu’n nakita mo ang kasaysayan ng bayan at kasaysayan ng isang uri ng pananampalataya,” director Joel Lamangan said. “Nais naming ipakita ang katotohanan sa likod ng buhay ni Felix Manalo sa isang kaparaanang reyalistiko, walang pagtatago ng katotohanan sa mga aspeto ng paggamit ng kamera pag-e-embelish ng iba pang mga shot at kung anu-ano pa sa isang makatotohanan at diretsong pamamaraan.”\n16. Needless to say, INC advisers were on hand the whole time the film was being shot and even during pre and post-production.\n17. Gladys Reyes said many of the scenes have little or no dialogue, “Pero ’yung emosyon ay siniguro po ng aming direktor na maitatawid namin sa mga manonood sa mga eksenang ito. Hindi kailangang magsalita ng kilometro na napakahabang mga dialogue para lamang maipadama kung ano po ’yung aming mga emosyon sa bawat eksena.”\n18. Felix Manalo’s birth was marked by the National Historical Commission (NHC), “Ibig sabihin historical person siya. Kaya ito po ang pelikula; ito po’y historical, ito po’y nagsasaad ng katotohanan ng mga nakaraang panahon ng ating bayan,” Joel said.\n19. Iglesia Ni Cristo has been in existence for 101 years now and it has reached six continents with Filipino and foreign members.\n20. “Felix Manalo” was shot for 58 days over a period of eight months with only the best and well-respected names in the local film production scene doing tedious work to ensure world class quality.
