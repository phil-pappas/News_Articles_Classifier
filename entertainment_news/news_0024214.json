Photos \nA Pittsburgh woman filed a lawsuit Wednesday against comedian Bill Cosby for abuse she alleges started over 30 years ago. \nA Pittsburgh woman filed a complaint Wednesday against comedian Bill Cosby seeking money damages for emotional distress and other charges. She becomes one of a dozen women suing for the same reason. More \nAccording to the complaint filed in the Court of Common Pleas, Renita Hill first met Cosby in 1983 when she was 16 years old. Cosby was in the process of finding a co-host for an episode of \"Picture Pages\" an educational children's television show Cosby hosted. The co-host search was held at Froggy's Tavern, where Crosby chose Hill from among the other young aspiring models and actresses. \nRead the complaint \nCosby had spoken with Hill's parents and assured them that he had her best interests at heart and further assured them he would be a mentor to Hill. \nShortly after, Cosby began to request that Hill meet him at various locations where he was performing, such as Atlantic City, New York City and Denver. \nAccording to the lawsuit, Cosby would have some form of alcoholic beverage waiting for her as soon as she arrived. After drinking whatever Cosby gave her, Hill would frequently “lose consciousness and wake up in her room the next day, oftentimes nude, disheveled, confused and disoriented.” \nHill claims while she was in the semi-conscious or unconscious state, she was sexually assaulted by Cosby. \nThe lawsuit says the abuse continued \"numerous times over the course of several years, starting when Hill was a minor and continuing until the completion of her second year at Spelman University\" in 1987. \nHill said she was afraid to come forward with her allegations of abuse because of Cosby’s wealth and power, but felt emboldened by the dozens of other women who have since come forward. \nCosby, 77, has denied all the allegations against him. He has not been charged with a crime, but the statute of limitations for many of the potentially criminal allegations has expired. \nThe lawsuit says Hill is seeking damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress, defamation and false light. \nHill’s attorney, George Kontos, is holding a press conference Thursday to discuss the lawsuit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T06:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T06:35:09.334+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
