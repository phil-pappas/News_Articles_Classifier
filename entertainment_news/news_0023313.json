We edited the film nearby, I walked across this square every morning so it’s lovely to be here. \n“The London Film Festival is very important. We are a great producer of film but we don’t have anything other than this big film festival so it’s wonderful to support it.” Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet and Danny Boyle (Ian West/PA) \nThe film, which is based on Walter Isaacson’s biography about the technology innovator as well as from interviews conducted by Aaron, spans a period of 14 years between 1984 and 1998, focusing on three major launches – the Macintosh in 1984, the NeXT Cube in 1988 and the iMac in 1998. Promoted stories \nKate, who won an Oscar for her performance in The Reader, portrays Jobs’s colleague Joanna Hoffman, a member of the original Mac team and the NeXT team. \nShe said she “loved” the 80s outfits in the first act, which saw her unrecognisable in big glasses and shoulder pads. Fassbender stars as Steve Jobs in the film (Matt Crossick/PA) \nShe said: “I absolutely loved it. The clothes of the 80s, such an extraordinary period, were just fantastic.” \nKate, 40, got to meet the real Hoffman in person. “She was amazing. She’s so warm and generous in the stories she shared with me and her friendship with Steve was what captivated me the most,” she recalled. \n“She really loved and respected him. Michael and I found a lot of her stories very useful because the physicality between the two of us was affected by the things she shared.” The co-stars on the red carpet (Vianney Le Caer/Invision) \nEarlier, she turned the air blue when she discussed learning her lines from Aaron’s dialogue-driven 185-page script at the film’s press conference. \n“I started reading and realised people talk for a long time. How the f**k? When I got to page 54, they were still talking,” she said. \n“I thought, ‘Holy s**t’. The pressure comes in not forgetting your lines. As an actor you learn your f***ing lines.” Who wouldn’t want a Fassbender selfie? (Ian West/PA) \nShe apologised for her outburst saying: “Sorry, I’m at home and I feel comfy.” \nJobs’s widow Laurene Powell has not given the film her approval although Steve Wozniak – who was Jobs’s business partner – consulted on the movie. \nMichael, best known for his roles in the new X-Men movies and collaborations with Steve McQueen, said he had “hesitations” about playing Jobs because of the family’s thoughts on the big-screen drama. Katherine Waterston rocked a black gown at the event (Ian West/PA) \n“It did make me hesitate. I was worried about how their late father, husband and friend will be portrayed and that weighed on my conscience,” he said. \n“There was a responsibility for sure. But I have to get on with my job. This wasn’t a biopic, it was a dramatisation so all the clues I needed was in the script. \n“I approached it with utmost respect for Jobs and his family and by no means did not set out to betray them. If they do see it, I hope they are not hurt by it because that’s not my intention.” Share article \nSteve Jobs opens in UK cinemas on November 13.
