As she looks out the kitchen window in front of her, she lifts her dishwater brown ponytail and wraps the cloth around her neck. Gravity pulls at the moisture in the cloth until it forms a droplet at the tail of the rag, then it releases itself to meander down over her breast to be absorbed by the plain manila cotton sundress. A voice on the radio unnecessarily informs listeners that the song just finishing was Hank Williams’“Your Cheating Heart,” then declares “This is Chuck Finley signing off. It’s now time for Harley Schwartz and the noonday news. We’ll see you tomorrow in this time slot.” Then with the customary chimes, bing, bong, bing, “Hello neighbors, this is Harley Schwartz with the noonday news. At the top of the news today, the National Weather Service has issued a Tornado Warning for our listening area until 7 p.m. tonight, so keep your eyes and ears open and call us if you … .” Blah … Blah … Blah. She turns and leans back against the sink with her arms crossed, looking down, watching Libby, sitting in front of the refrigerator on the old linoleum floor in her polka dot blue on white sundress, administering care to her Shirley Temple baby doll. Checking her temperature, wiping her face, then, reaching into her Nurse Nettie handbag, Libby retrieves a little pink stethoscope. Brushing her short dark brown hair back over her ears, she plugs in the earpieces then carefully listens to several strategic areas across Shirley’s bare chest. Like the opening of an oven to check on baking bread, a breath of hot air blows in from the open window over the sink, begging for her attention. She turns back to the window and watches the horizon of the plain intently for signs of a gathering storm. All she can see is the dog day haze and a few blades of long unmown grass swaying around the old Farmall tractor sitting along the fence row where it has been parked for years. She shrugs, thinking, Tis the season, and turns back to watch Libby.
