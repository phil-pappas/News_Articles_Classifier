We're both lazy and we're thinking sometime next year.\"\nNewton-John's daughter fought a well-publicized battle with anorexia and told FOX411, \"I think my fiancé had a lot to do with helping me get through it.\n\"I'm grateful I'm recovered fully, I'm healthy, I have a lot of fat on my body.\"\nShe recalled on Monday that recovery from the dreaded starving disease was hard: \"Terrible, awful having people taking pictures of you, writing about you when you're that sick.\"\nChloe said getting through it involved \"working on yourself, healing. It's years and years and years of life experience.\"\nIt also helps having a \"gorgeous\" tough guy behind her, who teaches Gracie Barra Jiu-Jitsu. \"He got his black belt from the best martial artists in the world,\" she boasted of Driskill.\nChloe also told reporters, \"I like to be someone that girls can reach out to and sort of, I don't want to say [be] an inspiration, but [tell them] you can get through it. It's a really difficult disease and has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric illness, so I like to be a positive story.\"\nMeanwhile, her famous mother Newton-John, 67, has also been through a lot, as she's a breast cancer survivor.\n\"I feel amazing. I have a cancer wellness center in Australia that bears my name,\" she told FOX411 after judging \"DWTS.\"\n\"I'm very proud and grateful for that so I put all my passion into funding the wellness programs so that other people going through cancer can have those healing experiences.\"\nMarking Breast Cancer Awareness Month, Newton-John, who was diagnosed in 1992, said her best advice to women is \"to do regular self- breast exams because I found my lump myself and if I hadn't been doing that, I maybe wouldn't have found the lump. When I found it I went to the doctor and they initially told me there was nothing wrong. I did a mammogram, it was negative. I had a needle biopsy and that's when it showed up. So you have to trust your own intuition. I didn't feel right.\"\nThe pop icon, who watched Hayes Grier and his partner Emma Slater recreate her \"You're The One That I Want\" dance with John Travolta from \"Grease\" on Monday's \"DWTS,\" also shared her memories about the hit 1978 musical.\n\"It was so long ago,\" she said. \"It was like going to a school that I never went to. I went to a very strict kind of school where they wore uniforms and they separated the boys and girls at either end of the school so [filming \"Grease\"] it was like going back to my childhood. I was 29 when I made the movie, that's Chloe's age [now]. It was really a blast, the music and the camaraderie.\"\nNewton-John has recently been teaming up with her singer/actress daughter; the two have a single out called, \"You Have to Believe,\" a remix of the singer's 1980 hit, \"Magic.\"\nAnd fans can still catch Newton-John's Las Vegas \"Summer Nights\" show at the Flamingo as she has extended her residency through January.\nThe star, now married to second husband John Easterling (she divorced Chloe's dad Matt Lattanzi in 1995) loves Las Vegas. \"I like being in the same bed every night,\" she said. \"I can take my husband, my dog, and cat. Vegas is a really cool place. There's not just the strip. There's a lot going on.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T15:00:20.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
