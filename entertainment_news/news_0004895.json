That's what self-taught amateur photographer Deborah Keever's newly released book is all about. Who would have thought that her passion for taking nature pictures would turn out to be an inspiration for a science book? As she compiled her detailed photographs of Argiope Aurantia or Garden Spiders, she writes alongside them scientific facts describing the daily life of these human-friendly arthropods.\nThe on-going importance of a balanced ecosystem inspired Keever to share this educational read that serves as a photo-documentary of the Garden Spider in her natural habitat. With the superb photo shoot capturing the daily life of the Garden Spider plus some interesting facts, readers – especially the young learners – will enjoy discovering the beautifully unique world of the Argiope Aurantia .\nThe Argiope Aurantia is an invertebrate animal with an exoskeleton. And in this book, readers will get an up-close look at how they produce silk from her spinnerets sac and wrap their prey or prepare their web. The detailed photographs will show how they capture insects by wrapping them in pure silk emitted from their spinnerets – and eating them while waiting for their next victim. They are of no harm to humans but they kill and eat the insects that are a pest to humans. Therefore, the garden spiders are friends to humans, not enemies, and they help keep the ecosystem balanced.\nThis book is available online and can be purchased at www.amazon.com and www.barnesandnoble.com .\nAbout the Author\nDeborah Keever , a retired Registered Nurse now, has time to enjoy nature photography. She is a self-taught amateur photographer. She and her husband Mike enjoy their children and six grandchildren in Raleigh, North Carolina .\nArgiope Aurantia by Deborah Keever\nPublication Date: October 24, 2014\nPaperback: $9.00 ; 26 pages; ISBN 978-1499085648\nTo request for a complimentary paperback review copy, please contact Edward Manning at BookWhirl.com by phone at (877) 207-1679 or by email .\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/captured-shots-of-garden-spiders-capturing-their-prey-300159761.html\n©2015 PR Newswire.
