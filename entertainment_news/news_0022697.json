The audiobook will be available on CD and for download on November 3, 2015 , simultaneously with the Scribner hardcover.\n\"This is the coolest audiobook ever, with a brilliant cast,\" says King. \"I was amazed and delighted.\"\nTHE BAZAAR OF BAD DREAMS draws together 20 incredible stories, many of them brand-new to audio. Introductions written and read by King himself precede each tale, offering a unique behind-the-scenes look at the story's origins or what inspired him to write it. Whether recounting his many hours spent on I-95 driving in a beat up station wagon to see his girlfriend ( Mile 81 ) or wrestling with the right and wrong of his college practice of supplementing his income by writing papers for less talented students ( Morality ), these introductions give a rare glimpse into the complex mind of a master storyteller.\nThrilling connections run between all of the stories in THE BAZAAR OF BAD DREAMS : themes of morality, the afterlife, guilt, and what we would do differently if we could see into the future or correct the mistakes of the past. The new stories, sure to captivate and dazzle listeners, include: The Little Green God Of Agony read by Hope Davis ( God of Carnage) ; Batman And Robin Have An Altercation read by Santino Fontana ( Frozen ); Premium Harmony and Summer Thunder read by Will Patton ( Falling Skies ); Bad Little Kid and Afterlife read by Dylan Baker ( The Good Wife ); A Death and The Bone Church read by Cotter Smith ( Next Fall ); Herman Wouk Is Still Alive read by Brooke Bloom ( Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close ) and Kathleen Chalfant ( The Affair ); Under The Weather and Mister Yummy read by Peter Friedman ( Ragtime ); Obits and ThatBus Is Another World read by Fred Weller ( In Plain Sight) .\nKing once again takes up the role of narrator for his previously published poem Tommy , and listeners will be familiar with other fan-favorites like Morality read by award-winning actress Mare Winningham ( Amber Waves ); The Dune read by Edward Herrmann ( Gilmore Girls ); the recently published Drunken Fireworks read by Maine humorist Tim Sample ; and three longer classics including Blockade Billy read by Craig Wasson ( Nightmare on Elm Street 3 ); UR read by Holter Graham ( Hairspray ); and Mile 81 read by Thomas Sadoksi ( The Newsroom).\nMagnificent, eerie, utterly compelling, the stories in THE BAZAAR OF BAD DREAMS comprise one of King's finest gifts to his Constant Listener-\"I made them especially for you,\" says King. \"Feel free to examine them, but please be careful. The best of them have teeth.\"\nABOUT THE PUBLISHER: Simon & Schuster Audio is a leading publisher of general interest audiobooks including bestselling fiction, nonfiction, business/finance, self-improvement, inspiration, language learning programs, original audiobook productions, and children's titles.
