(AP Photo/Chris Pizzello, File)   LONDON â€” \nFormer Supergrass frontman Gaz Coombes, electronica artist Aphex Twin and diva-dominated group Florence + The Machine are among 12 nominees for Britain's prestigious and unpredictable Mercury Prize for album of the year. \nThe list, announced Friday, is dominated by solo artists, including Roisin Murphy, Jamie xx and Ghostpoet. There are only two bands among the finalists, punk act Slaves and rockers Wolf Alice.Established in 1992 and open to acts from Britain and Ireland, the prize often favors the eclectic and obscure over better-known performers. \nSome winners, including Arctic Monkeys and Elbow, have gone on to mainstream fame, while others have failed to break through. \nThis year's winner of the 20,000 pounds ($32,000) prize will be announced Nov. 20.
