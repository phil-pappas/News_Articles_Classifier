Without showing the titular character's ( Krysten Ritter ) face, the video shows her picking a song on a jukebox after apparently getting into trouble. She walks past some guys who have been beaten down, an evidence of a big brawl, while Joan Jett 's \"Bad Reputation\" is played. Upon reaching the bar, she takes a shot of alcoholic drink. Her hand is smeared with blood, another hint that she's the one who knocked down the bad guys. \" Marvel's Jessica Jones \" is the second of four Marvel superhero shows on Netflix following the \" Daredevil \" series. Ritter plays the heroine, who battles demons from within and without after her short-lived stint as a Super Hero ended in tragedy. It is set to be released November 20 on the streaming service. Mike Colter will be introduced as Luke Cage on the show before later getting his own solo series. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T10:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T21:25:45.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
