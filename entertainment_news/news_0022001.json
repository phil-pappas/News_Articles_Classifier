(Photo: Rod Spicer)\nIt has been at least 15 years since the multi-talented Vanessa Williams has graced a concert stage in Metro Detroit.\nThe 52-year-old songstress will bring her musical stylings to the Sound Board at MotorCity Casino Hotel on Sunday night. It will be a walk down memory lane as Williams belts out tunes dating back to the 1980s, while giving those who mainly know her from film, television and theater a glimpse into her musical prowess.\n“I am not an actress who just sings cabaret songs. I have some major hits that are still being played on the radio today,” said Williams by phone Monday during a break filming CBS’ “The Good Wife” on location in New York.\n“There are, however, a lot of fans who don’t know my work as a singer. This concert will give them a brief edited story of my recording career.”\nOne such fan is Sydney Bayliss, who has admired Williams for her roles in the movie “Soul Food” and TV shows such as “Ugly Betty” and “Desperate Housewives.”\n“I love her. But other than a handful of songs like ‘Dreamin’, I can’t tell you much about her singing, which is why a friend of mine is taking me to the show,” the Southfield resident said.\nWilliams is not on tour, but performs about 35-40 shows a year, including benefits. The mother of four is performing this weekend at the casino’s request.\nBill Borenstein, vice president of entertainment and theater operations at MotorCity, said, “Vanessa gives such an amazing concert. She is having such a positive year and we are so excited to have her here.”\nThis summer, Williams married businessman Jim Skrip after meeting him in Egypt a few years ago. In September, the Miss America winner was welcomed back by beauty pageant officials after resigning her title in 1984 amidst a nude photo scandal. Longtime friend and current Miss America CEO Sam Haskell apologized to Williams and her mother in a television broadcast for the way the situation was handled and anything that made “you feel any less than the Miss America you are.”\nWilliams, the first African-American winner, wore the crown for about 10 months before Penthouse published, without her consent, explicit photos taken before her reign. She returned to the pageant as a head judge and a performer.\nWilliams, who graciously accepted the apology, said Monday it meant a great deal to her mother, who was visibly teary eyed.\nSunday’s concert will mark her first appearance at the Sound Board. The 1,500-seat venue boasts an intimate setting and a state-of the art sound system.\n“It’s designed so that everyone is close to the artist. That makes the experience that much better for the audience,” Borenstein said. “If the artist is having a great time on stage you can feel it. So everyone is in for a wonderful night with Vanessa Williams.”\nMusic lovers will be treated to such tunes as “Work to Do,” “The Sweetest Days,” “Save the Best for Last” and her platinum single “Colors of the Wind,” from the Disney Film “Pocahontas,” which won a Grammy and an Oscar for Best Original Song.\nWilliams has sold more than seven million records worldwide, including numerous Top 10 hits on various Billboard album and singles charts ranging from R&B and pop, to jazz, Latin and gospel. Her last album was released in 2009.\nThe author and award-winning actress made a return to the stage for a special limited engagement in spring 2014 in the Broadway musical “After Midnight.” She is scheduled to appear in three episodes this season of “The Good Wife.”\n“It’s nice to have a career that is more than one particular genre,” Williams added. “I’ve had 32 fantastic years doing what I like to do and bringing people happiness. It’s an honor to bring that to Detroit.”\nDelores Flynn is a Royal Oak-based freelance writer.\nVanessa\nWilliams\n7:30 p.m. Sunday\nSound Board at MotorCity Casino Hotel\n2901 Grand River, Detroit\nTickets: $35, $40 & $50\nTicketmaster or Sound Board Box Office\n21+ admission requirement", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7a8f55a5a858cc868c01353e4d5eec3168b1410d/c=0-55-1829-1427&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/08/DetroitNews/B99308095Z.1_20151008161615_000_GVVJR37M.1-0.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/08/DetroitNews/B99308095Z.1_20151008161615_000_GVVJR37M.1-0.jpg", "http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-10-09T00:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:12:46.575+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
