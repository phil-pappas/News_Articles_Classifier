The reason, says the actress, was that she has been busy with Doddamane Huduga and the minute she got a break from it, a rather unexpected break at that, she took off to Chicago to meet her brother who lives there.\nRadhika, we hear, returned to Bengaluru early this week and is currently figuring out what project to take up as soon as she completes Doddamane Huduga . Sources tell us that she has been approached for a couple of films, including Real Star Upendra's next, presumably Kanchana 2 . When we asked the actress, she confirmed the development, but said she was still undecided about which one to take up.\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-09-30T21:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:31:42.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
