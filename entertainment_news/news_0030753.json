Meanwhile, Kendall Jenner stole the show at Balmain with actress Jada Pinkett Smith and singer Joe Jonas looking on. \nHere are the highlights of Thursday's ready-to-wear spring-summer shows: Kendall Jenner wears a creation for Balmain as part of the Spring-Summer 2016 ready-to-wear fashion collection presented, during the Paris Fashion Week, in Paris, Thursday, Oct. 1, 2015. (AP Photo/Thibault Camus) \nKENDALL JENNER \nKim Kardashian was the talk of Balmain last season sporting a new blond hairstyle — and for spring-summer it was her half-sister Jenner's turn to rock the crowds from the runway. \nModeling for two looks — a space-age '60s jumpsuit and a geometric lattice dress — Kendall had all eyes on her. Pinkett Smith, meanwhile, stunned with slick-back hair in a cinched waist olive green Balmain sweater and ultra mini.

(AP Photo/Thibault Camus) \nStrapped, cinched waists and square belt buckles followed diagonal bands across the torso and huge metal neck-plates evoked a warrior princess. Slits and meshes, meanwhile, exposed sections of delicate skin. It was a nice contrast. \nThen there were the ruffles. Huge, billowing, tiered ruffles peppered the show like on one caramel column dress, or a black leather skirt. It put the clock to the '70s and shows that unapologetic Rousteing certainly doesn't do things by half. \nSINGER CAROLINE VREELAND PERFORMS AT SWAROVSKI BIRTHDAY Model Joan Smalls wears a creation for Balmain as part of their Spring-Summer 2016 ready-to-wear fashion collection, presented during the Paris Fashion Week, in Paris, Thursday, Oct. 1, 2015. (AP Photo/Thibault Camus) \nRising music star Caroline Vreeland performed to cheers at the glitziest party of Paris Fashion Week so far: Swarovksi's 120th birthday. \nThe VIP-filled soiree on Wednesday night also celebrated the release of a new book \"Swarovski: Celebrating a History of Collaborations in Fashion, Jewelry, Performance and Design.\" \nThough blond beauty Vreeland — who's also a model — might not be a household name, she's already fashion royalty, being the great-granddaughter of powerful Harper's Bazaar editor Diana Vreeland, who reigned across the magazine world from 1936 to 1962.

(AP Photo/Thibault Camus) \nThere was more than a whiff of Seventies' flower power. \nThe 44-strong show opening with billowing hippy flares with small retro print — contrasted nicely with a jogging top that might be seen on a girl running around the Tuileries Gardens. Relaxed yet chic was its statement. \nLater, floppy bows at the neck, flared sleeves, billowing harem pants, and dangling tassels further evoked the boho era.

(AP Photo/Thibault Camus) \nBut this collection was all about color: the indigo, beige, pale yellow, vermilion red and burgundy — that all came to a climax in a cascading rainbow gown that would certainly not be for the color-shy. \nCARVEN'S SANITIZED CHIC \nA large PVC greenhouse with white tube lights had fashionistas curious ahead of Carven's spring-summer show, only the second so far for new designers Adrien Caillaudaud and Alexis Martial at the age-old Parisian house.

This infused the 41-piece collection with the tight, crisp silhouettes and mini-skirts of the Sixties. \nThus, delicately flared pants in dove gray mixed with colored silk shirts, and one white striped sporty-looking top with neat colored lines. \nThe best of the Sixties musing came with a cut-out disc motif on a burnt orange or white mini, and a crisp white mini dress that looked almost like a nurse's uniform — stylishly evoking the sanitized feel A model wears a creation for Chloe as part of her Spring-Summer 2016 ready-to-wear fashion collection, presented during the Paris Fashion Week, in Paris, Thursday Oct. 1, 2015.
