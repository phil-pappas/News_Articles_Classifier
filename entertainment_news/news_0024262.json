Or steaks and seafood, but there’s so much more to it.” he said.\n“Our barbecuing culture has come on rapidly, as has our involvement in cooking in general. It’s a lot more relaxed, as opposed to a dinner party, where things can get a little bit more high pressure.\nOther Stories What’s the Buzz: Saint, sinner, shoosh Nrl 0 comments My lifesaving surgery is killing me Nsw 0 comments Alleged GoPro gang rapist already on bail Nsw Former NRL star ‘dragged woman down stairs’ Nsw ‘Why do sports clubs ignore victims?’ Nsw 0 comments Falconio killer ‘more like a prison guard’ Nsw “This will fit into our psyche so much better.”\nMy Kitchen Rules’ favourite Texan Robert Murphy, with daughter Lynzey, is appearing on Aussie BBQ Heroes. Picture: Channel 7 O’Donoghue has savoured his set time with MKR’s tall-talking Texan, who became a cult figure when he appeared on this year’s MKR with daughter Lynzey.\n“He’s a champion and the atypical American cowboy.”\n“Every time he opens his mouth, he’s got a story for you — from ‘when I was flying helicopters’ to ‘I shot myself once ...’ and in that Texan drawl, you just hang off every word.”\nBut his original TV bromance — and healthy rivalry — with Curtis Stone remains strong, he caught up with the celebrity chef for drinks in Sydney last week.\n“I’ve cooked for Obama and he’s cooked for Oprah, so we’re kind of on par.”\nO’Donoghue’s presidential moment came during last year’s G20, when the commander-in-chief almost caused an international incident over the barbecue fare O’Donoghue served.\n“The organisers were freaking out because he got up and the secret service were all on their devices, saying ‘POTUS is on the move’ thinking he was going to leave the event; but he just went back up to the barbecue for seconds. I was happy with that, but it was pretty funny.”\nGary Mehigan, Anna Gare and George Calombaris from Junior MasterChef. TV GOSSIP: JUNIOR BACK IN KITCHEN?\nIS Channel 10 about to send Australia’s kids back into the kitchen?\nAfter enjoying ratings success and family favouritism with The Great Australian Spelling Bee this year, the buzz is Junior MasterChef is also being considered for the network’s slate in 2016.\nWith the adult cooking series back on the boil, the time could be right to expand the franchise again — it was shelved in 2011 after two seasons.\nThe Beautiful Lie stars Benedict Samuel and Sarah Snook.
