The multi-talented actress played a little Truth or Dare with her The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 costars Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth , along with MTV's Josh Horowitz. Dared to shove as many marshmallows in her mouth as possible, the Oscar-winner stepped up to the plate and managed to squeeze in 10 of them – much to the amazement of her fellow actors. \"That does remind me of a date when I was 16 and chugging this Icee,\" Lawrence said after removing the marshmallows from her mouth. \"And then I burped and it all reacted in my stomach, and then all the foam just started coming out.\" After doing a quick impression of herself throwing up the Icee foam, Lawrence joked, \"Anyway, so that totally reminds me of dating. I don’t know why I'm single!\" Lawrence also dished on her costar's most disgusting habits during the truth phase of the game – and focused most of her attention on Hutcherson. \"The cricking of his neck and making that disgusting noise,\" she said, adding, \"He does spit bubbles when he's thinking.\" RELATED: What Did Jennifer Lawrence Send Amy Schumer After She Won Her First Emmy? Hemsworth chimed in on Hutcherson's behalf, saying, \"It's actually kind of cool, unless it lands on you.\" As for Lawrence's grossest habit, she declared shamelessly, \"It's probably that I don't wash my hands after going to the bathroom.\" Check out the video for more hilarious Truth or Dares and catch Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 in theaters Nov. 20.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:34:46.339+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
