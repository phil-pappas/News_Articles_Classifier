You haven’t lost your house or anything?’ He didn’t go that far but he was into it.”\n Mendelsohn confirms he loved researching the role far more than his famous co-star did, saying, “I did spend a lot of time in there (casinos). Ryan didn’t seem to care if he would win or lose.” Mississippi Grind was released at the Melbourne Film Festival in August.", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/d00cbd0cd81a9bf4c7f4da66c8911277", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c72bc460f0cb926fdddb1241a7e85f4a", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/d013b61afa3dd07df6c3fffecc4c4f85", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/2b34476e9bf985edaf43a927b79979b7", "http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/20/ryan-reynolds-mississippi-grind", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/77dfd1e8a93bbb19c1bf6c765c006342", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/879fe04d7025a96b1806c04473ea5f29", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-10-21T07:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:54:47.442+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
