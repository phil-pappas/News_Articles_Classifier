October’s theme is Murder a la Agatha Christie. \nThe Oct. 23 film is “Murder Most Foul” (1964, UK), a nonrated film that runs 90 minutes. While serving on the jury in a murder trial, Miss Marple (Margaret Rutherford) stands alone as one of the only jurors who thinks the accused did not kill his landlady. Using a court recess to do some freelance sleuthing, she follows the clues to a local group of actors and a bungling playwright (Ron Moody), who becomes her prime suspect. Charles Tingwell co-stars in this adaptation of Agatha Christie's “Mrs. McGinty's Dead.” \nCapping this month’s series Oct. 30 will be “And Then There Were None” (1945, USA). Friday Night Films are open to the public free of charge, although donations are gratefully accepted. Light refreshments will be served. For more information, call the library at 354-2453. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
