During a press tour to promote his newest movie \" Burnt \", the actor shows his support for the actress, who has become his frequent co-star in movies like \" Silver Linings Playbook \", \" American Hustle \", \" Serena \", and \" Joy \". \"One thing I could say is that's interesting because if you think that you only deserve a certain amount and that's not correct, it's about changing that mindset and sticking up for yourself the way that Sienna did,\" Cooper told E! News, referring to his \"Burnt\" co-star, Sienna Miller , who recently bailed on a play because she was paid less than her male co-star. \"So that's a great thing,\" he added. In a separate interview with Entertainment Tonight, Cooper said, \"There's a double standard in the whole world, yeah, for sure. This is just one aspect.\" He continued, \"Anytime there's a place where a voice can come out and be outspoken -- something Sienna did, or Jennifer -- that's great. ... I think it is making a difference.\" Fellow actresses also show their support for Lawrence. Emma Watson tweeted, \"O Jennifer Lawrence I love you so.\" Elizabeth Banks wrote on Twitter, \"I love Jennifer Lawrence.\" Jessica Chastain applauded her, \"Ye ! Get it girl.\" Beth Behrs posted, \"So true, J. Law. and so well said. Thank you.\" In an essay she wrote for Lena Dunham 's newsletter, Jennifer Lawrence said she \" failed as a negotiator \" because she \"gave up early.\" She explained, \"I would be lying if I didn't say there was an element of wanting to be liked that influenced my decision to close the deal without a real fight. I didn't want to seem 'difficult' or 'spoiled'.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Bradley Cooper News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T14:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:43:41.945+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
