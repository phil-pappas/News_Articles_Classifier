And will he now renounce kooky American blondes for a salt-of-the-earth Aussie type who thinks that the paparazzi is a topping you put on a pizza? Miracles do happen.\nYou don’t have to be Nostradamus to have predicted the union between the artist known as Gabi Grecko, 26, and colourful Melbourne identity Edelsten, 72, would not end well.\nIf nothing else it has been an action-packed ride full of mysterious hospital admissions, corset wearing (for her, not him), nudie runs and a bizarre marriage proposal in the middle of the Birdcage at the Melbourne Cup.\nAs romantic farces go, this one has been next-level.\nGeoffrey Edelsten and Gabi Grecko pose for a photo after their low-key Melbourne wedding. Picture: Nathan Dyer Social commentators have grown weary from the number of times they have been summoned by Grecko to hear her bitterly complain bitterly about her mahogany-haired husband (a devotee of the Ronald McDonald school of sartorial flare) to declare that it was all over. It seemed to be part of her weekly repertoire.\nEdelsten and Grecko enjoy a kiss in happier times. Picture: Roy VanDerVegt Television viewers saw for themselves how highly strung the ex-medico’s ginger-wigged bride can be on Celebrity Apprentice.\nOther Stories Awesome All Blacks lay Cardiff ghosts to rest Rugby 0 comments Will Geoffrey ever find love again?

Opinion 0 comments Robert Irwin’s animal instinct Celebrity Grecko threw a huge hissy fit because she was asked to sell her husband’s book, containing tales of alleged threesomes.\nThis caused a major meltdown and a scene in which she cast off her wedding rings.\nPerhaps Grecko had got her TV shows confused and thought she was appearing on Days Of Our Lives?\nAnd just like that, Grecko achieved the nearly impossible — people actually felt sorry for Edelsten for having to endure so much drama in his life. He began to look like a bit of a saint.\nShe certainly didn’t do herself any favours on Celebrity Apprentice.\nEven when brought back on the show after being eliminated, she has not performed well.\nShe failed last week’s challenge to sell products on a television shopping network by being flaky.\nBride Brynne Gordon and groom Geoffrey Edelsten pose for a photograph after their 2009 wedding. Picture: Getty In fact, Grecko has been so bad, she makes Edelsten’s second wife Brynne look like a natural talent for television.\nThis despite Brynne’s questionable efforts on Dancing With The Stars and her reality show My Bedazzled Life.\nIn the latest move for the star-crossed lovers, Grecko has returned to New York declaring that she is filing for divorce and their two-month marriage is kaput. Really?\nAdding even more spiciness to the marriage breakdown, she claimed her husband was in love with his secretary. This was the first anyone had heard of that.\nGabi Grecko has returned to New York, and has declared she is filing for divorce. Meanwhile, Edelsten was in the States but returned alone, looking sombre.\nThere were mixed messages: One moment he was Quote: d saying she faked her tragic pregnancy, and the next he had been “hopelessly in love” with her and spent a whopping “$1.5 million” trying to make her happy. (Of course, anyone who has been through a major break-up would be aware of these conflicting emotions.)\nHe has now gone silent on his marital situation.\n“I cannot help you with your questions as matters are fluid with some legal consequences,” he mysteriously declared when I contacted him. He’s not even guaranteeing he will be in the Birdcage on Derby Day. “I am planning to come to the races but it is dependent on a few things,” was his comment.\nLove on the rocks: Gabi Grecko and Geoffrey Edelsten. Picture: Instagram This is definitely a turn-up for the books. Edelsten being without an attractive, over-the-top woman on his arm at the spring racing festival is like a scone being served without jam and cream. During his five-year marriage to Brynne Gordon, the couple’s Flemington outings were the stuff of legend. For a while there each of Brynne’s outfits was more excessive than the last and the newspapers faithfully catalogued each one.\nHowever last year when Edelsten dropped down on one knee in his canary-yellow suit and proposed to Grecko in an outrageous head-dress by Sex And The City designer Patricia Field right in the middle of the Birdcage, it became one of the defining moments of the Melbourne Cup.\nAnd just to top it, Grecko momentarily lost the engagement ring in the Emirates marquee.\nGeoffrey Edelsten proposes to his girlfriend, Gabi Grecko. Picture: Bradley Hunter Gabi Grecko flashes her new engagement ring. Picture: Bradley Hunter So with the countdown on for the festival of the horses, Edelsten has just days to either reconcile with Grecko or find a new filly. Perhaps this time, the true shock value could be in finding someone who is actually suitable for him.\nInstead of trawling New York, LA or Las Vegas for his future partner, he should look in suburban Melbourne for a woman who’s at least in her 50s. A glam granny could not only help him to resurrect his image, but give him some of the respect he so richly deserves.\nYes, respect — Edelsten has already been through so much in his life, he is first and foremost a survivor and you have to give him kudos for that.\nGUESS WHO DON’T SUE\nWHICH Bondi identity is not quite the knockabout, affable personality he portrays. There is a long line of people who’ll never work with him again.\nWHICH TV personality and model is not quite as refined as she seems — at least when it comes to table manners? She has stunned acquaintances with her behaviour at the table, including eating with her mouth open.\nWHICH hotel, which regularly hosts bloggers for entire weekends, was so concerned about this newspaper wishing to photograph a personality having afternoon tea that they told us to book a room?\nWHICH millionaire’s choice of business associate is putting several noses out of joint from those who believe that the woman should not be managed in this way?", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f2248aee9b8271fd6c11b186ba04f07b?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/1b8196d378545a40b81428ac5c711d9c", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/bbe5e21fda1b3d21001c5231b1794750?width=316&api_key=zw4msefggf9wdvqswdfuqnr5", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b3324a85087704d3cd119be6124225cb?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/99fcba8ae82c8c3a820d363ee6835cce", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c5cae69f6310b1ac75aa7260fd194394", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b0eb27853091a774fcb6de188930e46b", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9329bd712aa8a61e89d554e45fc70831?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/8f3fc487c88364970742ba4bbaf99415", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/4ae65b9f089b17f48dcffd56be232e0c?width=316&api_key=zw4msefggf9wdvqswdfuqnr5", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b65542e4b2c48ba6dc99c1bce0aea72a?width=316&api_key=zw4msefggf9wdvqswdfuqnr5", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/273f8d21f4a54f0720388382dc1eee50", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/83a5e3ef23587f8eae7b3b38a5c6be08?width=650", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-10-17T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T10:17:20.995+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
