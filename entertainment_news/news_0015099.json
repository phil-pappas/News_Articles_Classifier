Wadeyar is a devotee of Durga and hence chosen the Vijaya Dashami festival to launch the film at the Kalikadurga temple in the city. Wadeyar, who started as a director with the comedy film Govindaya Namaha, returns to comedy after a spate of romantic and action films.\nNataraja Service is a slang for walking when you do not own a vehicle and have no money for the city transport. Wadeyar says there is a little more to that meaning in the film. \"This is a unique love story with a twist in the end. Walking is a full-time occupation for the protagonist in the film, who is called Nataraja. It is his full-time `service' to the heroine and because of his very helpful personality that the film gets the name Nataraja Service,\" Wadeyar said.\nAfter Govindaya Namaha, Wadeyar directed romantic and action films like Googly and Ranavikrama. He is currently shooting another romantic film Jessie which is nearing completion. \"Nataraja Service is a romantic comedy and not just a comedy film. The soul of the film is romance,\" Wadeyar said.\nTelevision actress turned film star Mayuri is playing the female lead in the film. After a successful career in television she was seen in the Shashank directed Krishna-Leela earlier this year.The film became a hit and Mayuri was signed up for two more films.This is the fourth film she has signed.\nThe film was earlier speculated to be produced by Puneeth Rajkumar. But it turns out that it is his manager and producer NS Rajkumar who is producing the film and Puneeth is only `presenting' it.Though the film will be launched on October 23, the shooting schedule will commence only in November.\nLike all the previous films he directed, Wadeyar has written the story and screenplay of the film. The technical team includes music composer Anoop Seelin and cinematographer Arul K Somasundaram.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:12:41.112+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
