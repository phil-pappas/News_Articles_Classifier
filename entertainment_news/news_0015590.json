Monica Wellington \n\"My Leaf Book\" is the perfect book for right now. \nAfter that, Monica Wellington's board book (Penguin Random House, $16.99) for 3- to 5-year-olds, remains a fine book to read to learn about leaves. \nThe writing is nothing particularly quotable. What makes this stand out is that it does not talk down to children and instead explains the different kinds of leaves in a matter of fact way and with lovely illustrations. A little girl makes a leaf book and in so doing she collects many different types of leaves and readers learn how to identify them. Monica Wellington \nThis would have been a very handy book to have years ago when my kids were in grade school and had to collect each of these leaves. In this, a curious little girl walks around and collects different leaves from different trees. \nShe starts a leaf book, and with her puppy as her companion, the girl uses her tree guide to figure out what sort of leaves she finds. Her first is a gingko leaf. \n\"Leaf shape is a good place to start in identifying trees. Gingko leaves look like fans. The gingko is the oldest tree on Earth. It has existed for millions of years.\" The girl, whose name we do not know, collects different colored and different shapes leaves. She finds leaves with different sorts of edges and sizes and the last page suggests many hours of terrific leaf projects. \nIf you're buying a present for a child's birthday, this with a pad and some paint could give a child many hours of wonderful art projects and a lifelong appreciation for leaves.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T14:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:41:44.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
