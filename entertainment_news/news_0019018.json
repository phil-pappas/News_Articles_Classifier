Alejo\nOctober 21, 2015 ‘Star Wars Rebels’ (Photos from Disney Channel Southeast Asia)\nFollowers of the animated TV series “Star Wars Rebels” had the thrill of their lives when, at the end of Season 1, one of the most iconic villains of all time made an appearance. Darth Vader has been called in to quell the rebellion and his inclusion in the series promises escalated action in Season 2.\nCast member Tiya Sircar (who voices Sabine Wren in the series) counts that as her favorite moment in S1 in “Star Wars Rebels Season 2 Featurette” uploaded on YouTube. “That was, like, goosebumps – and I knew that was gonna happen,” she said.\n“Just the sound of his breathing gave me chills,” added Vanessa Marshall (Hera Syndulla).\nAt the press conference for “Star Wars Rebels” held at the Star Wars Celebration in Anaheim, California early this year, executive producer Simon Kinberg talked about having James Earl Jones voice Darth Vader, the same icon of an actor that gave voice to the Sith Lord in the original “Star Wars” film trilogy.\nKinberg said, “One of the many surreal things making this show, maybe actually the most surreal thing, was when (creator, producer, supervising director) Dave (Filoni) sent me voice recordings, clips of the dailies of all the different takes. Hearing James Earl Jones untreated, playing the part, (speaking) lines that Dave and I essentially wrote together was pretty insane.”\nHe added, “You think, ‘I’m gonna write lines for Darth Vader, but I’m not actually gonna get Darth Vader to say them!’”\nDarth Vader\nFiloni said, laughing, “Now we just kind of look at each other and kind of high five when he (Jones) is not looking. And it’s an awesome moment.”\nSet 14 years after “Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith” (which came out in 2005 as part of the prequel trilogy) and only five years before 1977’s “Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope,” “Star Wars Rebels” follows the fledgling rebellion against the Galactic Empire, whose imperial forces have been hunting down the last of the Jedi Knights.\nReturning voice cast member Freddie Prinze, Jr. (Kanan Jarrus) says Season 2 will reveal more about his character. “You’re gonna learn a lot about why he is who he is… through a very special character who kind of helps motivate some of those feelings to come out.”\nLike everyone in the cast and crew, the pressure of being involved in the “Star Wars” universe is overshadowed by the excitement of actually contributing to it. “For me it’s just fun,” said Filoni, who marked 10 years working with Lucasfilm in April this year. “The story gets bigger; the stakes get higher – as it should be…”\nKinberg added, “Hardcore fans, and even more casual fans, see the connection tonally, emotionally and thematically between what we’re doing and what George (Lucas) did in the beginning… The approach of wanting to have the ethos of the original films is what they’re doing… whether in video games, movies, the stand-alone movies. And because of that, they fill all the piece and… has a singular voice and vision, even though there’s different filmmakers involved with each…”\nCatch new episodes of “Star Wars Rebels” Season 2 on Disney Channel and Disney XD in the Philippines starting Oct. 24.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:16:59.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
