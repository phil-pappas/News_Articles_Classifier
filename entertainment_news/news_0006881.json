The people of Earth have been nearly eradicated, and those who endure do just barely that. This story of perseverance against all odds is truly thrilling with each turn of the page.\nWhen a virus wiped out most of Earth’s population 108 years ago, the survivors created a feudalism-based government. Royal families rule over makeshift kingdoms. Things run smoothly in the world until Gwen McDowell and her brother, William, are picked up by the king’s guard. Gwen is forced to work as a maid while William fights in the guard they don’t believe in. The structure of the kingdom slowly falls the longer Gwen and William stay. In their efforts to blend in, they uncover several life-changing secrets about the royals and even themselves. How will these secrets affect the delicate balance of power and possibly the human race?\nReaders who wish to experience this gripping work can purchase “Legacy of Ashes” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708.\nAbout Page Publishing\nPage Publishing is a traditional New York based full-service publishing house that handles all of the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
