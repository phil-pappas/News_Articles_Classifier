For too long mental health has been something that families did not speak about, that schools did not know how to address and workplaces would ignore. This silence or ignorance leaves people living with mental health problems alone, afraid and without the help and support that they need. We cannot let this continue.\"\nLater in the day, they split up to a pair of other events. William attended anti-bullying workshop sponsored by his late mother, Princess Diana, while Kate, sporting a black-and-white Tory Burch dress, visited the Anna Freud Center, which specializes in helping children and young people with mental health issues.\nWilliam and Kate participated in a roundtable discussion with volunteers from the charity Mind about ways to remove the stigma attached to mental health issues.
