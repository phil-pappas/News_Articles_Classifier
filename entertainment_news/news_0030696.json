Matthew Gordon, 21 and his girlfriend Emily Kassianou, 20, were harassed and were even taken to police station, where they were forced to make a written apology for ‘intentionally spreading hate’, claimed a report by the Indian Express. According to the report, Matt and Emily, were visiting the famous Konark restaurant in the city, when a group of people, noticed the tattoo depicting Goddess Yellamma on Matt’s shin. Some people started clicking pictures of the tattoo, which they claimed was offensive and hurtful to Hindu sentiments. The couple objected to the pictures, but soon the group created a commotion, with some people demanding that Matt take tattoo off or else cover his shin up. Some people even suggested that Matt remove the part of his skin, where the tattoo was inked!

One of the people involved in the commotion was a local small time BJP worker, Ramesh Kumar. An Indian friend of the couple intervened and agreed for the couple to be taken to the local police station, to resolve the dispute. The Ashok Nagar police then instructed Gordon to make a written apology and wear pants and learn Kannada. The video footage posted by The Hindu shows an exasperated Gordon asking the police, what they expected him to do about his tattoo. \nEXCLUSIVE: Australian harassed in Bengaluru by BJP workers over sporting a tattoo of a Hindu goddess on his leg – thne.ws/1OCTdaN \nPosted by Hindu Hindu on Sunday, October 18, 2015 The apology read,”My name is Matthew, visiting from Melbourne, Australia. I am very sorry for offending Hindu religious beliefs by my tattoo. I did not know of this auspicious custom in regard to tattoo placement. I will make sure to cover it up while I am in India. Thank you for educating me in what is appropriate in regard to body art on my body. I am also extremely sorry for using inappropriate language.” Traumatised by the whole experience, Gordon quite expectedly said that he did not want to stay in Bangalore any more.

The effects of Hindutva extremism have become too pertinent to ignore right from the outright alarming Dadri lynching incident, to the relatively less violent ink attacks on Sudheendra Kulkarni and Jammu and Kashmir MLA Rashid engineer. There is no question that acts of intolerance are on the rise in India and this particular incident goes a long way in proving just how rampant they are becoming. \n(Image Credits: The Hindu) \nModified Date: October 21, 2015 3:40 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:37:24.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
