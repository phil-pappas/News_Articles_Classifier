Hart estimated the items dated from 800 A.D. to 1700.\n(Reporting by Daina Beth Solomon; Editing by Piya Sinha-Roy and Richard Chang )\nCast members Kaya Scodelario (L) and Dylan O'Brien from the film ''Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials'', pose for pictures in Beverly Hills, California August 28, 2015.
