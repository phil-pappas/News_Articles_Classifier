Donovan.\nIn 1960, Donovan, an insurance claims lawyer, managed to trade captured Russian spy Rudolf Abel (British stage star Mark Rylance), whom he had kept from the death chamber, for American pilot Gary Powers, taken by the Russians when they downed his U2 spy plane.\nAs to why it took more than 50 years for Donovan’s saga to hit the screen, Spielberg allowed that until two years ago when he read Matt Charman’s script, “I knew nothing about this story, Rudolf Abel, James B. Donovan.\n“I knew about Gary Powers because that was big national news when he was shot down and taken prisoner in the Soviet Union. But I knew nothing about how he got out of the Soviet Union.\n“That all came to me as all good stories come to us, in a surprise package.”\nOnce he read the screenplay, Spielberg was sold.\n“It was simply a piece of history that was so compelling to me. To know that something like this happened.\n“Here was a man who stood on his principles and defied everybody hating him and his family for what he thought he needed to do: equal protection, even for an alien in this country, even for a Soviet accused spy.\n“That was a righteous reason to tell the story.”\nSpielberg, who was at the Ritz-Carlton, had screened the film the previous evening for Donovan’s three children.\n“I was meeting with the two daughters and the son this morning, and I found out something I never knew before,” he revealed.\nThey told him that in ’65, Gregory Peck — best known today as Atticus Finch in “To Kill a Mockingbird” — had gotten the rights and would play Donovan.\n“Then MGM at the time said, ‘No.’ Tensions were too taut between the Soviet Union and America to get into the politics of the story — and I didn’t even know that until a couple of hours ago!\n“So we weren’t the first!”\n(“Bridge of Spies” opens Friday.)\n— cinesteve@hotmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:58:18.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
