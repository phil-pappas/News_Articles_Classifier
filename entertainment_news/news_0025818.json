Under a deal with prosecutors, Chen must serve at least 125 years in prison before becoming eligible for parole.\nProsecutors said Li called her mother-in-law in China on the evening of October 27 2013, saying Chen was in the house with a knife and threatening the family. When the mother-in-law heard children crying in the background, she called other relatives in New York who rushed to the home in Brooklyn's Sunset Park neighborhood. By the time they arrived, the five relatives were dead and Chen was dripping in blood.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:07:23.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
