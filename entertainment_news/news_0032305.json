Photo: Supplied \nFREE TO AIR New Tricks ABC, 7.30pm  \nDennis Waterman is the sole original cast member of this long-running BBC police series, and this is his final episode. Will last man Gerry Standing go out with a bang or with a whimper? And will he take his theme song (It’s Alright) with him? Not on your Nellie. This week Standing is in the frame (as they have it in BBC copperspeak) for the murder of a bent bobby 30-odd years ago. He could go for the obvious line of defence – “it couldn’t of bin me wot done it, cos I was working wif Arfur in Minder, wanneye?” – but then the drama would have been over in five minutes. Past cast members have damned the show (after leaving, of course) for being bland and more plodding than, well, a bored constable on the beat, and apparently even the Beeb has found it hard to disagree: this is the final series for the UCOS squad. Nicholas Lyndhurst has a couple of wry moments as his Danny Griffin takes a sick day to help Standing prove his innocence, but this not-very-funny and not-especially-dramatic comedy-drama feels like it’s just marking time until it can retire for good with a decent pension, a gold watch and a nice place on the Costa del Crim.   \nWild Germany SBS, 7.30pm  \nAdvertisement Think Germany and nature and you probably conjure images of the Black Forest. From there, you might head to Hansel and Gretel if you’re literary minded or to a fat slab of chocolate and cherry cake if you’re, well, if you’re me. Who knew the country had 2500 kilometres of coastline, every centimetre of which is trawled in part one of this four-part series as we seek fascinating wildlife. We get seals. We get deer. We get migratory birds. We get more seals. Dicky Attenborough may have suffered at the hands of Jerry in The Great Escape but brother David is safe; this is a mildly engaging nature doc, but Life Story it ain’t.  \nLive at the Apollo: Lenny Henry, Andy Parsons & Ed Byrne  ABC2, 9pm  \nSuccessful stand-up comedy is all in the timing. So ladies and gentlemen, please sit back and enjoy this episode of topical humour from 2009. Lenny Henry MCs enthusiastically, Andy Parsons points out the difference between Americans and the Brits (it’s irony; who knew?) and Ed Byrne looks six years younger, which makes him about 15 by my reckoning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:25:47.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
