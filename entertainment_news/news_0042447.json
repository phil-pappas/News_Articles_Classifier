You know, the one that requires you to dress up, eat candy, and party with your friends while in costumes. Yep, HALLOWEEN. And everyone knows this holiday is dedicated to looking sexy. And what better way to look sexy than in a Lady Lux designer swimsuit! Although you won't be by a pool, you can still rock that luxury swimwear! We've picked out costumes that require you to wear a bikini.Lifegaurd:Yep, the simplest way to get away with wearing a bikini. Of course, you have to dress the part up a little. Wear our Sea Side Siren Red bikini, some zinc and a whistle. Maybe some sunglasses if you're feelin' adventurous. This costume is simple and fun.Sexy Cat:Even easier than a lifeguard costume...a cat costume. All you need is a sexy Lady Lux Swimwear black suit, some cat ears, eyeliner and you're good to go. Try the Knock Out black monokini or the Little Black Triangle Bikini. These are sexy enough to distract everyone from the fact you didn't put any effort into a costume :)Hippie:All you need is the Beach Daze sundress, and a flower headband. This sundress is perfect and comfortable. You can even wear a bikini underneath. This costume will have everyone jealous of such a cute idea (and dress!!).Everyone's favorite holiday is coming up.
