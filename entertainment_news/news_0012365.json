Thank you for your kindness and understanding during this difficult time,\" the Kardashian family said in a statement . \nThe family flew to Las Vegas to be by Odom's side earlier this week. Khloe Kardashian remains at his bedside. \nOdom and Khloe were married for four years before splitting in 2013. While the two signed divorce papers earlier this year, it was never finalized by a judge, leaving Khloe to make medical decisions. \nKhloe's delicate handling of Odom's longtime struggle with addiction was commended last night on CNN . \n\"She does a very good job. You can only do so much. You can't force an addict to get well. ... But ultimately, you must leave and leave with love and kindness, but you can't continue to be a part of someone dying,\" said Dr. Drew to Anderson Cooper. \nAs of Thursday night, Odom is still unconscious and in critical condition at a Las Vegas hospital after reportedly taking cocaine and sexual performance enhancers at Dennis Hof's Love Ranch. \n\"You need to hurry please! Cuz he's got blood coming out of his nose, white stuff coming out of his mouth. I can't get him to wake up. He's like â€” almost not breathing,\" revealed a 911 call. \nOdom's children also released a statement to CNN saying: \"Thanks for your outpouring of prayers and support for our dad. We are here with our family and friends. We appreciate everyone respecting our privacy at this time. We ask for your continued prayers.\" \nThis video includes images from Getty Images.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T22:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:15:39.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
