A July concert featuring Doug Church and the Jersey Shore Pops represented the orchestra’s best-selling show this season. (Photo: Photo provided) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nLinda Gentille heard about Elvis impersonator Doug Church from some of her Jersey Shore Pops patrons. Go see him, they told her, he’s good. The voice, the moves — it’s as if “The King” had risen from his tomb at Graceland. \nGentille, the orchestra’s founder and conductor, caught his show more than a year ago. He was good. So good that Gentille was convinced her orchestra and Church’s mesmerizing stage performance could be a match made in Elvis heaven. \n“I approached him about working on arrangements that would take his show to a new level,” Gentille said. “Doug looks and sounds so much like him that when I listen to Elvis, I can’t tell if I’m listening to Doug or if I’m listening to Elvis.” \nThree months ago, Church and Gentille’s 29-musician orchestra collaborated onstage, a grand concert experience that channeled the ghost of Elvis and sold out the 1,000-seat Middle Township Performing Arts Center in Cape May Court House, home of the Jersey Shore Pops. \n“Our biggest-selling show of the season,” Gentille said. \nSo they’re doing it again on Saturday night, this time at the Lenape Performing Arts Center in Marlton. \nDoug Church has performed his Elvis tribute show for more than 25 years. (Photo: Photo provided) \n“The orchestra really lends an element of authenticity to the show,” Church said during a tour break. “Elvis performed a lot with an orchestra. It’s one thing when you’re working with (music) tracks or a five-piece band, but an orchestra — horns, strings, timpani — gives it such a lush sound. It’s almost like Vegas.” \nPatricia Villanueva saw his summer show with the Jersey Shore Pops. In fact, since seeing Church perform a decade ago at the Sheraton Hotel in Langhorne, Pennsylvania, Villanueva and her husband, Eugene, have become loyal fans who attend about 20 concerts a year, an allegiance that sparked a friendship and Church’s request last year that Villanueva, a 57-year-old bank teller who lives near Trenton, take on the presidency of his fan club. \nShe had never been a big Elvis fan. Tom Jones was her guy. But Church made her a convert. \n“The fans love Doug. He’s just so personable,” says Villanueva, who loves his rendition of “Hurt.” \n“He doesn’t think he’s Elvis Presley by any means. He just wants to keep Elvis’ memory alive, and he does it graciously and professionally.” \nPianist and entertainer Linda Gentille started the Jersey Shore Pops six years ago. (Photo: Photo provided) \nChurch’s head is crammed with more than 500 Elvis songs. But he resurrects the 1970s Elvis, that era of rhinestone jumpsuits and big sideburns, so his repertoire reflects those years of Presley’s career. The orchestral performance demands close scrutiny of songs that lend themselves to the treatment. \nIt means you’ll hear tunes like “Can’t Help Falling in Love,” “The Wonder of You,” “How Great Thou Art” and the Presley showstopper, “An American Trilogy.” \n“Doug and I spent three months deciding which songs had a lot of orchestration and could utilize horns and strings,” said Gentille, who charted the instrumental arrangements. “We chose more ballads, but that’s what Elvis did. Those songs tend to be dramatic, and an orchestra is dramatic.” \nIt is an intriguing music partnership. \nGentille, a spunky conductor who favors elegant gowns, is a piano tour de force who performed in Liberace’s Las Vegas revue as a teenager three decades ago and then was wooed to Atlantic City by Donald Trump in 1991 to be a house entertainer at his new Trump Taj Mahal. \nChurch, who lives in Mishawaka, Indiana, has been a professional Presley powerhouse for more than 25 years, with a voice and a look that are eerily Elvis, and does close to 100 concerts a year. But he’d never performed with an orchestra until Gentille made her pitch. \n“I hadn’t thought much about it. Perhaps I’d thought my show wasn’t polished enough, or that I wasn’t polished enough,” he said. “But there was the opportunity to do it. The time had come.” \nLinda Gentille conducts the Jersey Shore Pops as tribute artist Doug Church croons an Elvis tune. (Photo: Photo provided) \nPresley was just 42 when he died at Graceland on Aug. 16, 1977, his imposing stature as a rock pioneer and cultural god overpowered by the mortal ravages of prescription-drug abuse, failing health and erratic behavior. \nHis passing, of course, spawned an industry for Elvis impersonators. Decades later they still come in all shapes and sizes, from Philly to Chile, a potpourri of pompadours and sideburns, gyrations and hip shakes, Mississippi drawls and quivering upper lips. \nThose who’ve carved a professional living, like Doug Church, have risen above the Elvis coattail-riders to become masters of illusion, an ascension to the rarefied pantheon of Elvis tribute artists, or ETAs. But the amiable Church will tell you there still are critics with suspicious minds. \n“We’re still not widely accepted,” said Church. “There are a lot of haters, people who do not like impersonators or think you’re trying to fill Elvis’ shoes. But over the years, I think a lot of the lesser acts have fallen by the wayside. The legitimate ETAs have really improved — the performances are good, the costumes are good. They present a better image. They’re not some clown act.” \nChurch, who is around 53 — “yes, around,” he says coyly — never saw Elvis in concert. He became a fan about a year before the singer’s death. His own Elvis education amounted to intense study of Presley performance videos, analyzing every vocal inflection and every stylish nuance of an entertainer Church has long revered for his world-jolting talent, charisma and kindness to others. \nChurch unleashed his Elvis impersonation in U.S. Air Force talent shows as an enlistee in the mid-’80s. But it was his championship win in the 1991 “Images of the King” contest in Memphis that opened doors — the biggest a successful Las Vegas audition two years later with “Legends in Concert,” which thrives today as an international multimedia spectacle of tribute artists who mimic star singers of the past 60 years. \nChurch likes doing the big-production ’70s Elvis. Research has found that it’s a popular era with many Elvis actors. \n“Being theatrical is part of it,” Church said. “But it’s also more fun. The costumes are very exciting and garish.” \nChurch sells fantasy. A lot of female fans buy in to the moment. They hand him colorful scarves at the edge of the stage. Or they’re enthralled as Church, microphone in hand, a shimmering Elvis mirage in jumpsuits that can cost $4,000, kneels to plant a kiss on their cheek. \n“I’m bringing Elvis back to life as much as I can,” Church explained. “The people in the audience strap on their imagination caps and are happy to believe they’re at an Elvis show.” \nLinda Gentille keeps an eye out for offbeat shows like this. She started the Jersey Shore Pops six years ago with a small legion of pro musicians from the area, including some who’d played in casino orchestras. The band doesn’t do a lot of Beethoven and Schubert. Gentille says surveys of the 400 season subscribers highlight a preference for contemporary programs. \n“We tried a couple of classical shows, but they didn’t sell well,” she said. “I love classical music. But the baby boomers want to hear music they know. So that’s the music from the ’50s and ’60s. Elvis and Frank Sinatra are very popular.” \nChurch figures he’ll put on the wig, glue on the sideburns and zipper the jumpsuit for five more years, perhaps even 10 if the stamina is there. Patricia Villanueva certainly wants Doug Church to keep rockin’. It’s escapism for her soul. \n“It lets you forget the stress of your everyday job and life in general,” the fan club president said. “People at work know when I’m in a really good mood. They’ll say, ‘Patty’s going to see Doug this weekend.’ ” If you go \nDoug Church and the Jersey Shore Pops perform 7:30 p.m. Saturday at the Lenape Performing Arts Center, 130 Tomlinson Mill Road, Marlton.
