And I felt like, well yea, I brought 'em. Look at what I had to do to get these guys here. I mean, they didn't care anything about U of L. They didn't … it was just U of L. It wasn't nothing spectacular to them. So when you offer what you offer, then of course … I'll sign on the line. If this is what they're giving, they're providing. Sure.\"\nPowell told ESPN's John Barr that as many as two dozen women danced at the parties for Louisville basketball players, which were overseen by Andre McGee, Louisville's director of basketball operations at the time.\n\"Andre was the one who always had the money … made it rain,\" Powell said. \"(He) made the deals, paid for the deals. He would start the music and usually the girls would come out one-by-one. And they would dance for the recruit. And he would ask me, 'is there any girls that want to, you know, make extra money?' … that's when I started dealing with McGee.\"\nOne former Louisville recruit who chose to attend a different university told ESPN: \"I knew they weren't college girls. It was crazy. It was like I was in a strip club.\"\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nPitino promises answers in emotional speech\nFrom the ESPN story itself: Outside the Lines reviewed Powell's journals, text messages and phone records and independently confirmed that text messages sent to Powell to arrange the parties came from McGee's cellphone. Further, Outside the Lines said it independently confirmed a wire transfer of money from McGee to Powell on one occasion.\nPowell said the McGee would negotiate and pay for the \"side deals,\" as she called them.\n\"The recruit would pick out what girl he wanted. Andre would come to me and tell me what girl the recruit wanted and I would tell the girl,\" Powell said. \"She would say her price. I would tell him. He would say OK. Give me the money and I would sometimes hand it to them. Sometimes he would give it to them. That was just it. He would take them into another room and her and the recruit would do what they do behind closed doors.\"\nRick Pitino spoke to @ESPNDanaOneil & @YahooSports in phone call today regarding Louisville sex scandal accusations: pic.twitter.com/uqzSaH3n2V\n— SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) October 20, 2015 Powell told Outside the Lines that only five or six of the two dozen women did not take part in the \"side deals.\"\n\"I just knew side deals was sex,\" she said. \"Side deals were sex and if they wanted to make extra money, that's what the side deal was. Sex.\"\nPowell specifically named five Louisville recruits -- Montrezl Harrell, Jaquan Lyle, Antonio Blakeney, Jordan Mickey and Terry Rozier – as some who took part in the parties and the side deals. Lyle, Blakeney and Mickey ended up signing with other schools.\nLouisville players Montrezl Harrell (24) and guard Terry Rozier (0) walk off the court at halftime of a game against Connecticut.

Cox, acknowledged on the day the book was released that McGee knows Powell, but he said McGee did not pay anyone to have sex with players or recruits.\nPowell granted Outside the Lines access to her journal of the parties, which she said she kept because she knew \"this day would come.\"\n\"I knew that one day they would say 'she's lying,'\" Powell said. \"I couldn't make this up if I wanted to. I don't have the need to lie on anyone. … Everything that I'm saying is 100% the truth.\"\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nPowell, McGee face possible criminal probe\nPowell said that she never met Louisville coach Rick Pitino. But she said she once asked McGee if Pitino knew about the parties and he responded: \"He's Rick, he knows about everything.\"\n\"Four years, a boatload of recruits, a boatload of dancers, loud music, alcohol, security cameras, basketball players who came in at will -- how could Rick not know?\" Powell said a clip that aired on Good Morning America .\nThe University of Louisville and the NCAA are both investigating the allegations and McGee, now an assistant coach at the University of Missouri – Kansas City, has been suspended from his current role pending the investigation.\nUSA TODAY Sports discusses the reports of sex parties for basketball players and recruits on the University of Louisville campus.
