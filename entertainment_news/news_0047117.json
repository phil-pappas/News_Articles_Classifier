And then she smile's this innocent smile. Guess who has a kitten now?'' \nThe 'Automatic' hitmaker - who has been an animal activist for many years - already owns seven rescue dogs. \nHer love of animals extends further than just adopting them though as she also raises money for her charity, The Mutt Nation Foundation, whenever she can. \nMeanwhile, the blonde bombshell has reportedly been ''having a blast'' since she split from her beau Blake, 39, earlier this year but isn't looking to date anyone else just yet. \nA source said previously: ''She may have lost a husband, but Miranda gained a while new outlook on life.'' \nThe insider added: ''She's dressing sexier, exercising again and smiling more than ever. She lost part of herself trying to be what Blake wanted. Miranda feels her new look and attitude is just what the doctor ordered. She's having a blast flirting and being single.''
