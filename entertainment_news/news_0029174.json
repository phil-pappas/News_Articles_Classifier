(Photo: File / The Tennessean) 130 CONNECT 24 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nSince when can you go see and hear a free Nashville Symphony concert at the magnificent Schermerhorn Symphony Center? \nOn Saturday you can do just that as part of the symphony's annual Free Day of Music. \nNo ticket, no reservation. Nothing. Just show up and enjoy the symphony, or stay all day and take in a wide assortment of wonderful music. \nIt's up to you. The Tennessean|Ms. Cheap \nI must say that this is quite the deal, since symphony tickets to \"real\" concerts cost anywhere from $25 to $165, depending on the program and the seats. \nThis is the 10th time the symphony has offered this special free day of live performances, with stages set up inside and outside the Schermerhorn Center to give music lovers a musical feast, with tastes of everything from a student mariachi band (Mariachi Internacional de Nashville from Glencliff High School and Wright Middle School) to the Belmont Percussion Ensemble to Revolfusion Latin fusion and the Nashville Philharmonic, as well as several youth orchestras. “For a decade, Free Day of Music has been at the heart of the Nashville Symphony’s mission of providing great music for everyone.” Alan D. Valentine, symphony president and CEO \nAnd yes, as promised, the full Nashville Symphony will take over the stage of the Laura Turner Concert Hall at noon for an hour-long performance, featuring works by Rossini, Prokofiev, Ravel and more. \nIt is open seating in the entire hall — floor, boxes and choir loft included. so you can sit wherever you like. My insider information for the best seats is to shoot for one of the Founders Boxes on the second floor (the first three on each side coming out from the stage get you really close to the orchestra) or anything in the first 15 rows. \nBut I daresay there is not a bad seat in the house. \n\"There will be five stages (of music),\" said Kelley Bell, education and engagement program manager for the symphony, who has been working for months to come up with the deliberately diverse lineup. \n\"We want to have something for every age and every interest and provide a time for them to explore the building and Music City this way. In setting up the program, we wanted to have a broad range of genres,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:54:41.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
