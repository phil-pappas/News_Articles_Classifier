Sherman’s Books will have books on hand for purchase and signing at the event. \n“The Hidden History of America at War” is a myth-shattering and insightful look at war —why we fight, who fights our wars and what we need to know, but perhaps never learned, about the growth and development of America’s military forces. Starting with the founding of the nation and on through the war in Iraq, Davis provides an in-depth examination based on his belief that it is “nearly a moral imperative to understand war.” \nArguing that from its earliest days America has had an uneasy relationship with the military, Davis charts how our country’s military developed from a group of rag-tag “citizen soldiers” in 1775 to the high-tech, global and increasingly privatized organization it is today … and what we can learn from that transformation. He makes his case through six landmark battles: Yorktown, Va., in October 1781; Petersburg, Va., in June, 1864; Balangiga, Philippines, in September 1901; Berlin, Germany, in April 1945; Hué, South Vietnam, in February 1968; and Fallujah, Iraq, in March 2004. \n“Don’t Know Much About History” presents a complete survey of American history, from before the arrival of Columbus in 1492 right through the events of the past decade — from 9/11 through the election of Barack Obama and the first years of his administration. \nDavis’ appearance is part of Discover History Month at Camden Public Library. His success aptly makes the case that Americans don’t hate history, just the dull version they slept through in class. \nDavis regularly makes visits to schools and such venues as the American Museum of Natural History, the New York Historical Society and the Smithsonian Institution, where he has hosted “The Don’t Know Much About” game, played with student audiences. He will be on MPBN radio Tuesday, Oct. 27, from noon to 1 p.m. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
