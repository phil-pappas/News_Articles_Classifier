The Canadian singer, who's in the U.K. to promote his new album, performed a stripped-down rendition of his latest No. 1 single \"The Hills\" during his visit to the show. As seen in a video shared on YouTube, the Weekend's performance was pretty simple. Though he's joined on the dimly-lit stage by a full band, the 25-year-old crooner mostly showcased his vocals only over soft guitar riffs. Earlier in September, \"The Hills\" jumped to No. 1 on Billboard Hot 100 and replaced The Weeknd's other hit \"Can't Feel My Face\". The single is currently spending its second week atop the list. The Weeknd's two No. 1 hits are featured on his latest album \" Beauty Behind the Madness \" which has spent three consecutive weeks at No. 1 on Billboard 200. The singer will support the record with a tour that's set to open in early November. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T12:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T21:24:38.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
