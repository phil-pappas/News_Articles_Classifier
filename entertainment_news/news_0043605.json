Manufacture of polypropylene is largely dependent on the availability of raw materials. This, in turn, is dependent on crude oil and natural gas reserves. Polypropylene possesses beneficial properties such as high surface hardness, good tensile strength, and strong chemical resistance. As a result, it has gradually replaced other polyolefins in several applications. It is one of the most versatile polymers used in packaging, automobile, construction, electrical & electronics, and medical industries. Rising demand for polypropylene in the packaging industry is likely to augment the global polypropylene market in the next few years. Additionally, rising demand for lightweight vehicles is expected to drive growth of the polypropylene market during the forecast period. However, growing environmental issues and volatile raw material prices are projected to hamper growth of the market during the forecast period. Biobased polypropylene is likely to offer immense opportunities to polypropylene manufacturers from 2015 to 2023.\n\nThis report provides detailed analysis of the global polypropylene market in terms of volume (kilo tons) and revenue (US$ Mn) from 2014 to 2023.
