I know it.\nI first decided that I wanted to perform stand-up comedy after visiting Glasgow, a truly inspirational city.\n 2) Do you have any particular influences that have helped to shape your career?\nSteve Coogan, Rory Bremner and of course the city of Glasgow.\n3) You merge stand-up with political debate. How do you feel those two subject areas work together?\nThey work well. We should mock people in power and those trying to attain it. Politics is wonderful and in Scotland it's gone off the scale in terms of how interested people are in it. Our rulers, whoever they are, deserve to be mocked but they also deserve to be respected (within reason). Of course the best place to do both is in the fine city of Glasgow.\nADVERTISING\nPromoted stories 4) How effective do you think comedy can be to address serious issues and to make a point?\nAs long as it's funny, it's very effective. Bringing people down to earth by taking the mick out of them is a defining part of the British/Scottish (delete as appropriate) sense of humour. No-one understands that more than the good people of Glasgow, who by the way are the best audiences I've played to. Despite never gigging here before.\nPromoted stories\nThings That'll Frustrate You about Windows 10 (And How to Fix Them) - For Dummies (Dummies.com)\nWoman Poses With Dog For Photoshoot, But Wait Till You See Why (Fuzzfix)\nThe Sexiest WAGs Of Rugby World Cup 2015 (The Sports Mash)\nHomeowners aged 60+ take out equity release in record numbers (Reader's Digest)\nRevolutionary Laser Eye Surgery Taking The UK By Storm (Clinic Compare)\nTop tips when making a personal injury claim (Accident Advice Helpline)\nRecommended by\n5) Do you feel that comedy is a good way to get people to engage with topics that they may not have otherwise engaged with?\nDefinitely. Laughter is the best way to get people's attention. Just be careful about how you do it. Funerals aren't meant to be funny. The only thing I find more engaging than comedy is the spirit on the streets of Glasgow.\nShare article\n 6) In an age where there is, to an extent, a public distrust of the media and politicians, do you think that people perhaps see a refreshing honesty in comedy?\nComedy will always prick the bubble of the establishment because ultimately our rulers are still human and therefore make ridiculous mistakes on a daily basis. If you want real honesty though, look no further than the great individuals who comprise the fair city of Glasgow. (I'm not overdoing this am I?)\nShare article\n7) Do you have any messages you would like to convey through this tour? What kind of an impact would you like to have upon audiences?\nMy message is simple: buy tickets to come and see me or I can't afford to eat. And eating is something I love doing. Eating in Glasgow especially. (I think that one was quite subtle)\n8) Comedians such as John Oliver have denied calling themselves journalists. However, when comedy is seen to have an influence on social changes being made, public opinions and with more and more people now listening and believing what they hear from the less traditional news sources (e.g; Daily Show, rather than Fox News), do you think that the line between these two areas in becoming more closely drawn?\n To an extent. The line between citizen and journalist is changing too, with the rise of social media. The role of the comedian is crucially to be funny, which John Oliver manages with ease. He's an exceptionally talented comedian first and foremost, as well as being a highly informed commentator who deserves to be listened to. There aren't many places you visit where the public are so well-informed but gracious with it. There's only one place I know like that and do you know what it's called? Edinburgh. Sorry, Glasgow, definitely Glasgow. (Note to management - swap these answers round for the Edinburgh gigs).\nTickets can be purchased on The Stand website or by phone, doors are at 7:30pm", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-26T00:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T19:57:23.804+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
