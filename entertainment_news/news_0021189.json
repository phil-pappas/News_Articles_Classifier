(UPI) -- A Massachusetts police department announced officers are handing out \"citations\" for good behavior such as wearing bicycle helmets.\nThe Concord Police Department said the scheme, masterminded by Officers Ron Holsinger and Robert Capone, will involve up to 200 \"citations\" for good behavior being given out to residents for rule-abiding activities including wearing bicycle helmets, holding a parent's hand while crossing the street, wearing a seat belt, yielding to pedestrians in a crosswalk, looking both ways before crossing the street and crossing at a crosswalk with the light.\nChief Joseph O'Connor said recipients of the citations will be entitled to two free scoops of ice cream from the Reasons to be Cheerful dessert cafe.\n\"Reasons to be Cheerful and Wade Rubinstein are committed to making a positive difference in our community and we are appreciative that they have partnered with us,\" O'Connor said. This unique and lighthearted initiative fits perfectly with our department's goal to provide exceptional service all of the time.\nCopyright 2015 by United Press International Share Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1740305&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1740305", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1740305&h=Massachusetts+police+give+out+%27citations%27+for+%27good+behavior%27"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:24:18.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
