The ladies appeared to be on good terms, but in reality Joanne was sleeping with Louis behind her back.Louis has managed to keep his infidelity under wraps for all this time, but his secret finally comes under threat when Joanne arrives in the Hollyoaks village later this year. © Lime PicturesCould Simone's marriage be about to crumble? Speaking exclusively to Digital Spy, Leskovac commented: \"I am thrilled to be playing Joanne in Hollyoaks. She's an interesting character with a lot of depth and intensity, but she's also very vulnerable too. She is challenging to play and I welcome that. \"From the first time I met Karl Collins and Jacqueline Boatswain, there was an instant chemistry and respect and they are fantastic to work with. I am delighted to be in a storyline with the Loveday family as they are such a lovely, dynamic family and awesome, generous actors to boot. \"We do have such a giggle on set but still remain professional - you've got to enjoy what you do! I am loving being part of the show and all the cast and crew have been very welcoming and friendly.\" © Lime PicturesThe Loveday family When Joanne turns up to see Louis, she reveals that she's desperate for money and needs his help.Knowing that Simone can never find out what happened between them, Louis will feel the pressure to stay in Joanne's good books. Could she be about to stir up some serious trouble for the Loveday family?A Hollyoaks insider told Digital Spy: \"Louis is stunned when Joanne appears out of the blue. He's always kept quiet about their affair, in part because the fling prevented him from picking up his daughter Lisa from school on the day she went missing 14 years ago.\"After living with her own guilt over Lisa's disappearance for all these years, the truth about what Louis was up to that day would be devastating for Simone for more reason than one.\"Leskovac is best known to soap fans for her roles as Natasha Blakeman in Coronation Street and serial killer nurse Kelly Yorke in Holby City. She also starred in 2014's acclaimed crime drama Happy Valley.Read more Hollyoaks spoilers and newsDigital Spy Soap Scoop video - hit play below for gossip on Ben and Kathy's EastEnders reunion, Aaron's Emmerdale arrest, important news for Fiz and Tyrone in Coronation Street and a shock kidnapping in Hollyoaks. function onTemplateLoaded(experienceID) { bcExp = brightcove.getExperience(experienceID); modVP = bcExp.getModule(APIModules.VIDEO_PLAYER); modExp = bcExp.getModule(APIModules.EXPERIENCE); modCon = bcExp.getModule(APIModules.CONTENT); modVP.addEventListener(BCMediaEvent.BEGIN, onVideoStart); modVP.addEventListener(BCMediaEvent.STOP, onVideoStop); modVP.addEventListener(BCMediaEvent.PROGRESS, onVideoProgress); } #_containermyExperience4532176223001 { height: 100%; } // InSkin integration parameters: InSkinParams['myInSkin14532176223001'] = { 'srv_SectionID': '', 'srv_SectionIDPlay': '123757', 'srv_Keywords': '', 'plr_ContentID': 'myExperience4532176223001', 'plr_ContentType': 'BRIGHTCOVE3', 'plr_ContentW': 558, 'plr_ContentH': 314, 'plr_NoSkinContentResize': true, 'plr_NoSkinContentW': 618, 'plr_NoSkinContentH': 348, 'plr_NoSkinInSkinResize': true, 'plr_NoSkinInSkinW': 618, 'plr_NoSkinInSkinH': 348, 'plr_ResizeOnHideSkin': true, 'plr_HideSkinOnExternalAd': 'all', 'plr_ShowSkinAfterExternalAd': true, 'cnt_SmartPlayer': true }; // create the InSkin object: var InSkinObject4532176223001 = new InSkin.Base('myInSkin14532176223001'); brightcove.createExperiences(); if (!navigator.userAgent.match(/Android/i)) { InSkinObject4532176223001.init(); ai_type=\"video\"; } Get the Inside Soap magazine on your iPhone or iPad", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:13:49.632+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
