Photo: Janie Barrett \nClubs NSW will sue for \"publication of utterly false claims\" by Mr Garrett, who now says it was a cheque in the envelope rather than cash, and that it was given to him before he won a seat at the 2004 election, not after.\nAdvertisement \"We considered the initiation of of legal proceedings very carefully before coming to this decision, and only decided to proceed once the ABC refused to issue a retraction or apology,\" Clubs NSW CEO Anthony Ball said.\n\"The ABC was well aware that Mr Garrett had a confused recollection of events and that Clubs NSW had denied Mr Garrett's original and revised recollection when it decided to proceed with this story.\"\nIn his recently released memoir Big Blue Sky , Mr Garrett described how \"the clubs were generous donors to candidates\".\n\"In fact, a Clubs NSW representative had given me an envelope full of cash at an early meet-the-candidates event for NSW MPs. When I realised what it was, I gave it back.\"\nMr Garrett then issued a correction and requested that the claims be excluded from the documentary and book.\n\"This was my recollection at the time and I referred to it in a later interview for a documentary,\" he said in a statement.\n\"I subsequently became aware, after checking with a person who was present when I was handed the envelope, that in fact it had contained a cheque made out to my federal electorate council.\"\n\"I immediately informed my publisher and the documentary producer of the error so it could be corrected - not because of any external pressure.\"\nHe said he had never claimed it was a bribe.\nClubs NSW also said there had been \"no contact\" with Mr Garrett between the original and revised allegations.\nThe organisation is seeking further legal advice regarding the decision of the book's publisher, Allen & Unwin, to publish the original allegation and accompanying correction, which they believe to be \"inadequate\". \nThe ABC has declined to comment.\nFollow us on Twitter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T02:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:08:07.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
