Games releases Snaption on Kickstarter.com. Snaption is the game of funny captions played with personal photos where players can say whatever the they want.\nSan Luis Obispo, CA (PRWEB) October 05, 2015\nPic me! Games is proud to announce that their newest card game – Snaption – is now live on Kickstarter. The premise of the game is simple – one player finds a photo on his or her phone and the others compete to come up with funny captions, based on the cards in their hands. What sets Snaption apart from other games is the use of personal photos of people, events, or inside jokes the group knows. The game also introduces blanks in the caption cards, which lets each player tailor their caption for the photo and for the group. Since the game is meant to be played among friends, using familiar photos makes the game extra fun to play, but images can also be sourced from the Internet, magazines, photo albums, or anything else close at hand.\nAlthough the idea for the game of funny captions is fleshed out and prototype game sets have been created, Snaption is on Kickstarter to raise money for mass production and game expansions, such as additional card packs and an app version. There are several levels of support available, including a $25 level that gets you the game, all the way up to a $2,000 level that nets you the game, a handful of cool expansions, a limited edition prototype, a second signed copy of the game, an afternoon with the game creators in San Luis Obispo and more!\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13001388.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/snaptionKS", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13001388.htm"], "published": "2015-10-05T16:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T15:16:35.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
