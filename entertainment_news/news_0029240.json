The Walking Dead \nSeason-6 debut \nSo maybe there's a reason why the town of Alexandria has been able to survive in the midst of a zombie apocalypse. But perhaps the very thing that has been protecting the town has become the town's biggest threat, slowly but surely. There never is a shortage of things for Rick (Andrew Lincoln) to worry about, is there? \nWhen: Sunday, Oct. 11 on AMC \n2. Fargo \nSeason-2 debut \n“Okay, then.” It's a catch phrase that you'll come to recognize as this anthology series embarks upon its second season, which is set in 1979. Another stellar ensemble cast has been assembled, featuring Kirsten Dunst, Ted Danson, Patrick Wilson, Jesse Plemons, Jean Smart, Kieran Culkin and Cristin Milioti. Okay, then. \nWhen: Monday, Oct. 12 on FX \n3. The Knick \nSeason-2 debut \nI'm a big fan of this series, which is set in New York in the early 1900s. As Barrow (Jeremy Bobb) prepares to move the struggling hospital uptown, Dr. Edwards (Andre Holland) lobbies to be appointed chief of surgery in the absence of Dr. Thackery (Clive Owen). As you'll recall, Thack has, ahem, a slight addiction problem. \nWhen: Friday, Oct. 16 on HBO Canada \n4. The Romeo Section \nDebut \nSo Romeo and Juliet was a play by some guy named Shakespeare. I also recall a great song of that name by Dire Straits. But now the terms Romeo and Juliet refer to spies in this Vancouver-set series from Chris Haddock. Starring Andrew Airlie, Jemmy Chen, Juan Riedinger, Stephanie Bennett and Eugene Lipinski. \nWhen: Wednesday, Oct. 14 on CBC \n5. Crazy Ex-Girlfriend \nDebut \nRebecca Bunch, played by Rachel Bloom, isn't crazy. She merely gave up a junior partnership at her law firm in New York to move across the country to West Covina, Calif., merely because that's where the guy she dated for two months at summer camp a decade earlier happens to be living. Not crazy at all, right? \nWhen: Monday, Oct. 12 on CW, Showcase \n6. Murdoch Mysteries \nBecause of his association with the Anti-Imperialist League, Mark Twain (played by guest-star William Shatner) stirs up controversy during a speaking engagement in Toronto, which still is staunchly pro-British at this juncture in its history. Murdoch (Yannick Bisson) must protect the esteemed American writer. \nWhen: Monday, Oct. 12 on CBC \n7. Mary Tyler Moore: A Celebration \nDebut \nThis new documentary features dozens of classic TV and movie clips, as well as comments from Mary Tyler Moore herself and many of her famous cast-mates. But beyond that, Oprah Winfrey recounts how Moore inspired millions – including Oprah herself – as television's first independent career woman. \nWhen: Tuesday, Oct. 13 on most PBS affiliates \n8. Truth Be Told \nDebut \nMitch (Mark-Paul Gosselaar) and Tracy (Vanessa Lachey) are neighbours with Russell (Tone Bell) and Angie (Bresha Webb). These two diverse couples will talk about absolutely everything, be it sex, race or any other subject that your best instincts tell you to avoid. Based on the life of series creator and writer DJ Nash. \nWhen: Friday, Oct. 16 on NBC, Global \n9. Jane the Virgin \nSeason-2 debut \nAfter Jane (Gina Rodriguez) learns of baby Mateo’s abduction, chaos ensues, especially when everyone realizes a ransom is being demanded. Trying to help, Rogelio (Jaime Camil) Tweets about Mateo’s kidnapping, but that merely makes the Villanueva family targets of the paparazzi. Think before you Tweet, people! \nWhen: Monday, Oct. 12 on CW; Tuesday, Oct. 13 on Shomi \n10. Chicago Fire \nSeason-4 debut \nResidents of a Windy City neighbourhood band together to protest a drug den, but their actions hinder members of Firehouse 51 when they are called to battle a blaze. Meanwhile, a trafficking ring run out of a strip club puts Casey (Jesse Spencer) in danger. But hey, don't blame the strip club itself, let's not get silly. \nWhen: Monday, Oct. 12 on Global; Tuesday, Oct. 13 on NBC", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T21:50:44.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
