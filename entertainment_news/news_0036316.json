The \"Jealous\" singer showed up at the 2015 Maxim Halloween party held in Los Angeles on Saturday, October 24, wearing a \"Hamburglar\" costume. 23-year-old Nick donned a black and white striped shirt with a black cape that featured a hamburger on the back. He accessorized his costume with a red hamburger-print tie, red gloves and matching red high-tops. What made his look far more interesting was his hamburger phone case. During the occasion, Nick performed a short set of about 3-4 songs a little after midnight. He stayed in true character and even handed out hamburgers to the crowd. Also spotted attending the Maxim party among others were pro dancers Peta Murgatroyd, Maksim Chmerkovskiy , Val Chmerkovskiy, Mark Ballas, and his girlfriend BC Jean. Besides, there were also the likes of actor Kyle Massey, Karrueche Tran , Draya Michelle, Kendra Wilkinson , as well as Tom Sandoval. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T00:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T11:12:38.363+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
