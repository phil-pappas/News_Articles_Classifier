He was my age at the time and he told me how at first he didn’t believe all this stuff — he thought it was propaganda.\n“Then he did his research and understood it was true. He said, ‘In the end, we just went to work.’\n“It sounds so simple, but it helped me. You don’t want to play a character who all the time is emotionally involved — you want the audience to suffer, not yourself.”\nFehling’s first big break was as the German soldier in Quentin Tarantino’s “Inglourious Basterds” whose birthday celebration in a tavern climaxed with gunfire and carnage.\n“Homeland” is particularly apt because it’s filming all 12 episodes in Fehling’s hometown, Berlin.\nWhile “a set is a set” anywhere an actor goes, he likens this American production to “a train that goes and never stops. It’s different because you never know what’s going to happen in the next episode; you don’t know your character’s arc or where your character is going to end up.\n“That’s pretty new to me. This is a challenge that I take as an opportunity.\n“And working in English so continuously,” he added, “really helps me — and it’s fun.”\n(“Labyrinth of Lies” opens Friday.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:27:26.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
