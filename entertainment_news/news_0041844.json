Their lyrics betrayed the enmity. When Dhewa came up with “Pinda Panyanga”, Macheso’s then chanter Jonasi Kasamba popularised the line “usatyisidzirwe nezizi kuti rine nyanga, hadzisi nyanga inzeve” (don’t be intimidated by the owl’s fake horns). \nDhewa hit back on the next release and asserted “hongu ndinoziva kuti zizi harina nyanga, asi rakamhara pamusoro penyanga” (I know an owl does not have horns but it is sitting on a higher position — on top of horns). \nSuch was the cat-and-mouse relationship between the two. It made the industry exciting and Dhewa will always be remembered for being Macheso’s toughest rival. He had the energy, confidence and zeal. \nHis live shows were outstanding and his hits made an impact in the country and beyond. He refused to move from his base in Kwekwe to Harare where most of his shows and studio sessions were concentrated because he was proud of his hometown. \nAlthough he was classified as a Leonard Dembo copycat in his early days, Dhewa went on to create his own unique style that had rhumba elements. \nSome of his songs now make the list of popular hits released on the local scene. He was a hard worker and a determined artiste. Even when cancer got the better of him, he continued fighting and would get up from a hospital bed to go on stage. \nHe became frail but remained focused. Ladies wept at one of his last shows after seeing him coming on stage in a sorry state. But the musician took his guitar and sang on. He was a strong character. \nThat was Dhewa, a man who would fight his own battles and even encouraged people to fight against cancer. \nMay his Soul Rest in Peace! \nNow, his son Peter has been going on with the music despite a heavy criticism on his first project “Mushonga Mukuru”’ that was released about two years ago. \nMany were wondering whether the young musician would be able to keep his father’s legacy. \nSince taking over the reins of Utakataka Express, Peter has made serious efforts to keep his father’s legacy alive. \nThough he has his weaknesses, the Young Igwe, as Peter is fondly known by his fans, has tried not to let down the fan base created by his fighting father. \nSoon after Dhewa’s death some of the senior band members deserted him for Energy Mutodi’s band but Young Igwe managed to lure them back. \nMusic lovers have accepted him as Peter, a different person from his father but the young musician still has a legacy to keep and fight for. \nHis latest offering “Mabasa aMwari” that was released about a month ago has received a warm welcome from fans. \n“I am fighting to have his (Dhewa) legacy live and that explains why I am working hard to improve on everything,” he said. \nLike his father, he is now playing lead guitar on most of the songs and on his latest album he played the guitar in the song “Samasimba”. \nThe song is regarded as one of the best from the album. \nPeter said Tongai was a strict father who did not give him time to do music. \n“Mudhara aisada kana kunzwa zvisina basa aitoti ukada kuti umboenda kuband wairohwa zvakaoma. (He was strict and would reprimand me for going to shows). But with the help of band members and some of his live DVDs I am learning,” he said. \nThe young musician vowed to work hard. \nA number shows have been lined up in remembrance of Dhewa, the musician who turned the tables in the music industry. \nToday, Peter will be sharing the stage with Seh Calaz and Suluman Chimbetu at Dandaro Inn in the first of series of honorary shows. \n“I think this is the time people should come in numbers to see the spirit at Utakataka. We want them to see that we are doing our best as a group to keep my father’s legacy alive,” he said. \nTomorrow, the show goes to Mushandirapamwe Hotel in Highfield where Peter will be sharing stage with Kinna and DJ Cables. \nAt that show, Dhewa’s mixtape with most of his hit songs will be released. \nOn Saturday, the commemoration goes to Chinhoyi where Romeo Gasa and Ricky Fire will support Utakataka Express. \nOn Sunday, the celebrations come to Jongwe Corner where Jah Prayzah and Sister Jean will join the festivities. \nAll will be done in honour of Dhewa’s career and contribution to the music industry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T01:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:13:17.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
