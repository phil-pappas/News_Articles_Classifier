Symone admitted that she would discriminate against someone for their name.\n\"I'm not about to hire you if your name is ‘Watermelondrea'. It's just not gonna happen,” Symone said.\nSymone joined the cast of The View in 2015. Before going on The View, she started in a number of telelvision shows and movies. She began acting at age 3 on The Cosby Show. During her teenage years, she stared in That's So Raven on the Disney Channel.\nHer comments had people talking as of Friday night.\nPlease get @ravensymone off of television! @TheView\n— Cj III (@Th3Man0fsteel) October 10, 2015 Raven-Symone' apparently never misses an opportunity to put her foot all the way in her mouth.\n— Le'Petty (@FamilyGal_) October 10, 2015 Names are made up @ravensymone . You can't 'discriminate' against people because of a name that they had no hand in choosing . Nor should you\n— Jacyra (@TheJayBeeshow) October 9, 2015 Raven Symoné won't hire anyone with a \"black\" first name. And I won’t hire anyone with a pretentious, misused acute accent in her last name.\n— Mrs. Betty Bowers (@BettyBowers) October 9, 2015 That Raven-Symoné used \"Watermelonisha\" as an example of a \"black name\" shows you how deep the internalized racism and self-hatred goes.\n— Jamil Smith (@JamilSmith) October 9, 2015 How do you, a Black person w/ an ethnic name, justify proudly endorsing discriminatory hiring practices on a nat'l platform, @ravensymone ?\n— Ron.
