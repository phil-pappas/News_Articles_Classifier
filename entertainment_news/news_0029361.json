Here’s a movie about a once-successful music manager/agent who has fallen so far he can’t get a crumb, and he is trying his best to have some sort of comeback by discovering and representing a new talent. And it’s directed by a once-successful filmmaker (six Oscar nominations and one win) who hasn’t had a solid hit of a film in more than two decades (you’d have to go back to “Rain Man” for that one), and is trying, but maybe not his best, to have a comeback by putting a bankable star in the lead of a movie with a promising premise. The filmmaker is Barry Levinson, the star is Bill Murray, and “Rock the Kasbah” is about a down-on-his-luck guy who gets talked into putting one of his singers on a USO tour to Afghanistan, where he discovers a young woman who can do more with a Cat Stevens song than Sinatra could do with anything by the Gershwins. That irony? The movie is a mess, filled with incomplete story strands, performances that show promise then fall flat either because the dialogue is dull or a character is underused (or in a couple of instances just vanishes from the film). It starts out on the right track, with one of four Cat Stevens tunes (the droll and underappreciated “Pop Star”) behind the credits, then introduces Richie Lanz (Murray), a music businessman who, in his words, “gave Madonna her name” and “told Jimi Hendrix to sing ‘The Star Spangled Banner’ at Woodstock.” Hint: Don’t believe him. He also told Ronnie Smiler (Zooey Deschanel), one of the singers on his “roster,” that she’d soon be doing her own songs, not covering other composers. But that was a year ago, and she’s still his office assistant. Richie is a liar, but he’s always looking for an opportunity that just might make some money for him and whoever’s with him. A music booker for the USO hears Ronnie singing some U2 in a club and is so impressed, he convinces Richie to bring her to Kabul to entertain the troops. Kabul: traffic jams, crowded sidewalks and streets, soldiers with big guns, explosions, and most recently, an assassination attempt on the president. It’s a hellhole, one which Zooey Deschanel fans will be unhappy to learn she flees from, quickly, never to be seen again in the film. It’s also where Richie first meets soldier of fortune Bombay Brian (Bruce Willis), who has a couple of convincing tough guy scenes and is then reduced to appearing sporadically. Richie later gets together with Nick and Jake (Danny McBride and Scott Caan), who represent IBM (International Ballistics and Munitions) and only sell bullets “to the good guys.” Richie soon finds himself alone, robbed of his money and passport, and stuck in the middle of the desert with some weapons-wielding tribesmen, when he hears the voice of a young woman silkily singing “Trouble” (yep, Cat Stevens again). I can make her a star! I’m gonna get her on the Afghani version of “American Idol!” (Actually, that’s real; it’s called “Afghan Star.”) I’m gonna to be rich! He never really says that, but it’s what he’s thinking. Things don’t go too well when her dad catches on to his scheme since it’s illegal for women to sing in that part of Afghanistan. Things get worse when the deal with bullets for the good guys (hey, he needed the money, so he got involved) also goes south. But the most irritating thing is that so many stories start then stop or are there for no coherent reason. Like, why is Kate Hudson playing a hooker named Merci who promises Richie that, for the right price, she’ll leave him “broken and drooling?” This is an unpleasant, unfunny comedy that only needs to be seen by Bill Murray completists and Cat Stevens fans.
