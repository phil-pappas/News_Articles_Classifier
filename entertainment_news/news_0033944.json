Cinnamon Swirl French Toast sandwich is a knockout 1 / 5 Back to Gallery This week, I reached out for a new Cinnamon Swirl French Toast Breakfast Sandwich at Carl's Jr. and Hardee's, the sister burger chains with 3,600 restaurants between 'em.\nWith apologies to Bill Maher … Old Rule: If a menu item has more than four words in its name, I'll pass. But this time, I'll let Carl's Jr./Hardee's put words in my mouth. What's not to like? Cinnamon - crave it. French Toast? My fave breakfast. Sandwich? Put two in the bag and I'll be on my way.\nHere's the Cinnamon Swirl French Toast Breakfast Sandwich breakdown: a folded scrambled egg, your choice of meat (ham, bacon or sausage), American cheese and maple-flavored glaze between two slices of French toast.\nTotal calories: 580 (with sausage). Fat grams: 34. Sodium: 1,110 mg. Carbs: 58 g. Dietary fiber: 1. Protein: 20 g.\nManufacturer's suggested retail price: $2.99.\nI know, this sandwich sounds an awful lot like McDonald's pretty darn good morning McGriddle, which uses toasted maple flavored-infused waffles as housing units for the egg-cheese-sausage trinity.\nThe Cinnamon Swirl French Toast Breakfast Sandwich is new, but is it an improvement over the McGriddle? I'll answer that question with another question: Are you a waffle person or a French toast fan?\nFor me, it's an easy one: I heart French toast. Carl's Jr./Hardee's take on French toast doesn't match taking thick slices of challah, dipping them in cinnamon-laced egg batter and cooking them in a frying pan on your kitchen stove. But the flavor notes of eggy dip and cinnamon are there.\nWhile the maple flavor is factory-installed in the McGriddle waffles, Carl's Jr./Hardee's slathers a rich, super-sweet maple paste on its Cinnamon Swirl French Toast Breakfast Sandwich. Edge to Carl's Jr./Hardee's. The maple flavor jumps off this sandwich in leaps and bounds. You get sweet maple, spicy cinnamon and salty sausage - it's a potent triple crown of taste.\nBoth the Cinnamon Swirl French Toast Breakfast Sandwich and the McGriddle come with a folded scrambled egg from a pre-packaged mix. But at McDonald's you can order off the menu and get a fresh-cracked fried egg on your McGriddle. Point, McDonald's.\nBut here's the clincher for Carl's Jr./Hardee's. Their breakfast sandwich is simply larger. And you know our mantra in the drive-through: Less is not more … more is more. We like bigger for our buck.\nCinnamon Swirl French Toast's real headline, though, is its talk-of-the-town TV commercial. Sure, it stars a curvy bikini model biting sensuously into the sandwich, but that isn't your typical Paris Hilton-Kim Kardashian-Kate Upton hottie.\nThat's mixed martial arts superstar Ronda Rousey. And she's wearing a push-up sports bra. Like the other spokeswomen, Rousey is a knockout - with her perfect 12-0 record as a pro fighter.\nHow convincing is Rousey as a product endorser?\nPut it this way. It takes longer for you to eat a Cinnamon Swirl French Toast Breakfast Sandwich than for Rousey to make her opponent cry uncle in a UFC ring. That makes her incredibly credible.", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/13/8717005/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/13/8717008/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/13/8717008/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/13/8717007/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/13/8717009/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/13/8717005/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/40/15/62/8445058/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/13/8717009/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/13/8717007/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/40/15/62/8445058/5/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-30T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:27:31.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
