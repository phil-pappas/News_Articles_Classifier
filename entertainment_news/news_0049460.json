TRIP seemingly serves as a last resort for seniors who need transportation. Smith said the program reimburses qualifying seniors for trips and rides provided by private individuals. TRIP advances the senior a check and the senior pays the person who gave him or her a ride.\nLast year, Smith said, the program paid for 127,000 free trips for 1,028 unique users in Riverside County.\nLeaders with the Beaumont-based Pass Transit also seek to enhance senior services. Attendees Wednesday were urged to fill out a needs survey before leaving.\nClaudia Shields of Cherry Valley said she suggested establishing more fixed routes for seniors like herself. She lives north of Wal-Mart in Beaumont. As it stands, the fixed route travels in a east-west circuit; she wants to see a north-south route to cut down a trip that takes 45 minutes.\nBeaumont resident Brenda Teeman wants to see the city establish a taxi subsidy service, and is working with other seniors and Knight to explore such a program.\nTeeman moved to Beaumont from Walnut, where a similar program is in place that directly pays taxi companies to transport seniors to medical appointments and facilities.\nKnight said the intent of Wednesday’s event was to serve the community’s seniors as best as the city can, to return the favor.\n“They served all of us their whole lives,” she said. “They are a very significant part of our community.”\nContact the writer: 951-368-9079 or rmbrown@pe.com Twitter: @RichardBrown_PE", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvrbxo-b88528275z.120151005101322000g0ccar3c.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvrbxp-b88528275z.120151005101322000g0ccar5s.10.jpg", "http://ilpconnect.org/", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvrbxp-b88528275z.120151005101322000g0ccar5s.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvrbxo-b88528275z.120151005101322000g0ccar3c.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:07:52.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
