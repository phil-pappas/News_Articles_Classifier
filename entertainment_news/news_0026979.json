He is also the author of Shadowboxing , and two short story collections, Father's Day and The Promise . His new novel Ghost River  (UQP) follows the efforts of two boys from the slums of Melbourne to save part of the Yarra River from developers.\nA Kestrel for a Knave\nBarry Hines \nIt was a remarkable experience to pick up a novel set in the depressed north of England and discover that the boy at the centre of the story, Billy Casper, was a character I identified with like no other. Billy gets beaten up by almost everyone around him; his older brother, kids in the schoolyard and a psychopathic teacher. Respite comes in the form of a bird, a kestrel Billy forms a loving bond with.\nSlaughterhouse-Five\nKurt Vonnegut \nAdvertisement Vonnegut is one of my literary heroes. In this novel he interrogates the brutality of war in a surreal but affecting manner, as only he could. Billy Pilgrim, the protagonist, time-travels between his mundane life as a returned soldier, to the bombed-out city of Dresden, where he is a prisoner-of-war, and onward to the planet of Tralfamadore. The novel is hilarious and heartbreaking; a reflection of Vonnegut himself.\nWhen The Emperor Was Divine\nJulie Otsuka \nThis is a quiet novel, and it remains a favourite. The story is set in San Francisco, after the bombing of Pearl Harbour.  Japanese-Americans are being rounded up and interned. The family at the centre of the novel, parents and a boy and girl, each tell of their experience. It is a story of intolerance, bigotry, fear and courage. Not a word is wasted in this beautifully crafted story.\nIsland: Collected Stories\nAlistair MacLeod \nAlistair MacLeod apparently wrote slowly, and with painstaking care. It shows. These stories, set around Cape Breton on Canada's west coast are crafted with precision. I go back to Island time and time again. I learn from the stories, but most of all I love them. They are my comfort reading.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:31:27.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
