So you've got to be cool with that.\" \nAnd in reference to Kanye's 2010 album 'My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy', he added: \"This is the second tip, saying that you have a beautiful, dark, twisted fantasy. That's what's known as 'off message' in politics, you can't something like that.\" \nAnd Obama even poked fun at himself while questioning Kanye's chances of being voted into office. \nHe said: \"Do you really think this country is going to elect a black guy from the south side of Chicago with a funny name to be President of the US? That is crazy! That's cray.\" american idol", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:31:41.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
