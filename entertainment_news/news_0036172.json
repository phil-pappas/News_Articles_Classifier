Quick Clicks \nThe new facility would operate as a public-private partnership, with a board of directors that would initially include actors Elijah Wood and Simon Pegg. \nThe grand hotel, located just a few miles from Rocky Mountain National Park, opened in 1909. \nBy the 1970s, its grandeur was fading, and the hotel had gained a reputation for being haunted. \nThat reputation served it well when guest Stephen King found inspiration there for his 1977 bestseller \"The Shining,\" reviving interest in the hotel and solidifying its status as a hotbed of paranormal activity. \nThe hotel offers regular ghost tours and will be hosting \"3 Nights of Fright\" this Halloween season. In 2013, the Stanley launched an annual horror film festival. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource . All rights reserved.
