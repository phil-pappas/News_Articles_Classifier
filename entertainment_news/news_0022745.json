Deepika has now opened her own NGO ‘Live Laugh and Love Foundation’ that will focus on spreading awareness on mental health and provide help to those suffering from depression and other forms of mental illness. Her foundation was launched by the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Devendra Fadnavis and at the launch, Deepika was joined by designer Sabyasachi Mukherji (who has also battled depression in the past), Kiran Rao, Ronnnie Screwvala, Shobhaa De and Deepika’s parents, Ujjala and Prakash Padukone. \n\nDeepika, when did the idea to start this NGO germinate? \nI think mental health as an issue needs to be addressed very seriously in our country. My team and I decided to do this a couple of months ago. It’s been a lot of work. Thankfully, professionals from different fields have come forward and we have been able to put the foundation together with a lot of dedication. It actually happened much sooner than we thought possible. We thought it would happen sometime next year but we thought the World Mental Health Day would be the best day to launch Live Laugh and Love foundation....and we did it! \nYou have managed to get support from individuals belonging to different fields. How did that happen? \nI think everyone in their own capacity can make a difference. Here people — be it from sports, entertainment, business and even the medical field — who believe they can make a difference have come forward. \n\nWhy did you choose Live Love and Laugh as the name for your Foundation? \nLive, Love and Laugh is something that I live by. I know we all lead stressful lives now but you have to keep reminding yourself that it is important to live love and laugh. After all, that is what life is all about. Most importantly for people like me, who have had an experience with anxiety and depression, I think it is important to know that there is hope. And we, as a Foundation, are here to help you. We need to spread awareness and get rid of the stigma on mental illness. \n\nAnd how do you plan to achieve that through your NGO? \nWe will have a website. As a Foundation, we have several plans for various stages. The initial stage is to root out the stigma and spread awareness. All the information will be available on our website for anyone who needs any kind of help in dealing with stress, anxiety or depression. You can go to the website and it is a very simple process — out there, you will feel like you are talking to a friend. It will guide you on your feelings and enable you to seek help.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T15:00:56.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
