Filming on his season and the romance sure to ensue is currently underway, and some of the lucky ladies in the running for his roses have already been identified.\nMore From Cosmopolitan There are two returning contestants: Becca Tilley and Amber James are in the mix, Us Weekly reports ; the pair previously appeared on Chris Soules's series (and, in Amber's case, the last season of Bachelor in Paradise) and are back in back-to-back seasons, presumably because they watched Kaitlyn's turn as The Bachelorette in turn also and, you know, saw Ben on screen.

Reality Steve, who first reported both Becca and Amber's casting, also says there's a pair of identical twins, Vegas cocktail waitress identical twins, in the cast. In other words, look forward to triplets (possibly conjoined triplets?) on the second season of UnREAL .\nFollow Alex on Twitter . ​", "external_links": ["http://realitysteve.com/2015/10/01/the-bachelor-ben-spoilers-cast-daily-links-10-1/", "https://twitter.com/beccatilley5/status/635995670285934592", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1600x2460/gallery-1444060436-140521-7942.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/980x1506/gallery-1444060436-140521-7942.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/640x984/gallery-1444060436-140521-7942.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/480x738/gallery-1444060436-140521-7942.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1280x1968/gallery-1444060436-140521-7942.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/768x1180/gallery-1444060436-140521-7942.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1600x800/landscape-1444060436-140521-7942.jpg", "http://twitter.com/maybealexislost", "http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/amber-james-becca-tilley-returning-for-ben-higgins-the-bachelor-2015110"], "published": "2015-10-05T20:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:44:13.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
