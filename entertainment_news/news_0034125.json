Although that wasn't on her husband Kevin's wish list, he was happy to join her. “A new, exhilarating experience was shared, creating a stronger bond between us,” Behrens says.\nDiving with manta rays in Hawaii was on Patty Behrens' bucket list. Although that wasn't on her husband Kevin's wish list, he was happy to join her. “A new, exhilarating experience was shared, creating a stronger bond between us,” Behrens says.\n(Behrens family) Bucket lists, in general, reflect a positive orientation to the future, says Scott Pytluk, a professor of clinical psychology at Argosy University in Chicago. Psychologists consider this healthy for couples as well as individuals.\n\"When individuals set specific goals, even when they seem out of reach, they demonstrate hopefulness,\" Pytluk says. \"When partners plan for the future together, as long as there's flexibility in it, they're expressing a joint sense of hope about their lives together. Couples flourish when there are mutually agreed upon goals and dreams.\"\nIn a 2000 study in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, researchers looked at the connection between shared \"novel and arousing\" activities and the quality of a relationship. Predictably, the authors said, there was a correlation between sharing exciting activities and relationship satisfaction.\n\"This is because adventuring strengthens and deepens bonds and provides a kind of reservoir of common experience that can feed the relationship for years in the form of memory,\" says Patricia Johnson, co-author of \"Designer Relationships: A Guide to Happy Monogamy, Positive Polyamory, and Optimistic Open Relationships\" (Cleis Press). \"Composing a bucket list together can help to reinforce the sense that your relationship is collaborative and co-created.\"\nMarriage and family therapist Patty Behrens of Fresno, Calif., says sharing a bucket list of dreams and desires also deepens communication and releases the brain chemical oxytocin. Commonly called the \"love hormone,\" it has many psychological effects, including the level of your emotional attachment to a partner.\nGetting started\nAlthough relationship experts agree that your bucket list should be freewheeling and creative, having some guideposts will make it more helpful. Their suggestions are as varied as the things you would like to do (or be), but a good start is for each individual to have separate fantasizing or daydreaming sessions first.\nReach back to your childhood to recall anything you ever wanted to try, says Tina B. Tessina, a Southern California psychotherapist and author of \"Love Styles: How to Celebrate Your Differences\" (CreateSpace Independent Publishing). Then, compare lists, and note what you have in common. The differences will offer opportunities to hone your ability to compromise as well as help each other achieve separate goals.\nBehrens adds that couples don't need to experience their bucket list items together to gain the benefits. Her husband, Kevin, realized one of his by traveling a long, rocky trail in his all-terrain vehicle with his buddies, getting out in the wilderness, sleeping on the ground and taking in some incredible scenery.\n\"I shared in his excitement as he planned the trip,\" Behrens says. \"Even though I wasn't participating, a closeness developed as I supported him in his bucket list. (I was) genuinely thrilled for him and anticipated hearing about his adventures when he returned.\"\nBut they did share an adventure that was on her list, something he hadn't even thought of: diving with manta rays off the coast of Hawaii. \"A new, exhilarating experience was shared, creating a stronger bond between us,\" Behrens says.\nSome couples start right away. Atlanta author Monique Honaman and her husband created a bucket list that was akin to their wedding vows. Now, they review it a couple of times each year, she says, crossing off what they've done and adding to the list when a new idea pops up.\nHonaman notes that they don't erase what they've done from the list, but leave it there and date it so they can use it to review their relationship \"progress\" since that date and reminisce about an experience they don't want to forget, large or small.\nLarissa Lam of Los Angeles, however, offers a cautionary aspect of couples' bucket lists: Don't spring an adventure on your partner when she's out of town. Lam, a singer who also hosts an online advice call-in program, was on a business trip in Hong Kong when her new husband called to let her know he was about to take a class on training wild animals. As in, lions and tigers and bears.\n\"Oh, my. First off, my husband is a mechanical engineer. Why in the world would he do this?\" Lam says. \"He told me this was something on his bucket list and he figured he'd do it while I was out of town. I was certainly questioning what else I didn't now about him at that point.\"\nLam, however, turned her misgivings into a chance to talk about their bucket lists, learn more about each other and use the experience to practice understanding and support.\nSeven years into the marriage, she wants to head to Antarctica to see penguins. Her husband has no desire to freeze his tush off to see flightless birds — but does make a point to give her all the articles he finds on travel to the South Pole.\nNeed some inspiration?\nTo get bucket list ideas and tips on how to set one up, to see how others are achieving a goal, or even to find out what the favorites are among nearly 290,000 members, go to www.bucketlist.org .
