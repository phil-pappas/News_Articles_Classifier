(RYAN KNELLER / THE MORNING CALL) Ryan Kneller Contact Reporter Of The Morning Call The story of the region's rich silk-making history, as see through three mills. \nWhen talking about past prominent industries in the Lehigh Valley, most people are quick to bring up Bethlehem Steel. \nWhat is less known is the region's rich silk-making history. \nAt the turn of the 20th century, the Lehigh Valley was the world's second-largest producer of silk, with the industry becoming Allentown's largest employer in the late 1920s. \nBetween 1881 and 1989, as many as 224 mills produced the luxurious fiber in the Lehigh Valley. The peak production year was 1928, when 106 mills operated simultaneously here. \nThe silk mill jobs helped to make up for the loss of jobs from closing iron mills. Area business leaders sought out silk producers, touting the region's cheap, abundant and non-unionized labor, its good railroads and availability of coal power in the wake of a slumping iron industry. The iron industry suffered from the collapse of the national railroad building boom in 1873.

The facility on North Lumber Street ended production in 1989. \nWhile the area's robust manufacturing disappeared, some of the grandiose buildings have not. \nMany former mills, including the P&P Mill on North Third Street in Allentown, Bethlehem Silk Mill on West Goepp Street, Dery Silk Mill on Race Street in Catasauqua and McCollum and Post Silk Mill on Madison Avenue in Nazareth have been turned into apartment buildings. \nOthers such as the Lipps & Sutton Silk Mill, now home to Fountain Hill's borough hall, found other uses. \nEaston's Simon Silk Mill is the latest to begin a rebirth. \nDevelopers say the 14-acre property will be home to a mixed-use facility, complete with apartments, artist space and retail shops in a few years. \nIn light of this work, here's a look at the site's history and future plans, and the stories of two other silk mills in the Valley. \nSimon Silk Mill \nIn 2006, the Easton Redevelopment Authority acquired the sprawling campus of the former R&H Simon Silk Mill to spur its reuse. The mill had been built in 1883 along the Bushkill Creek. \nNew Jersey developers Mark Mulligan and William Vogt came on board in 2010, and construction began in August. \nThe $50 million project on North 13th Street includes plans for 150 residential units, which will be located on mostly the upper floors of primarily three buildings, and about 125,000 square feet of commercial space, says Mulligan, CEO of VM Development Group. \nThe project should be complete by the end of 2018, he adds, with at least 33 of the \"higher-end luxury\" apartments to be ready for occupancy by the end of 2016. \nThe historical character of the more than a dozen buildings will be maintained as much as possible, Mulligan says, with exposed brick walls, refurbished hardwood floors and restored windows. \nMany of the one and two-bedroom apartments will be in loft spaces, with skylights in the attic. \n\"We're excited to see that we're fully financed and underway,\" Mulligan says. \"The city's been a great partner with us. It wouldn't have happened without the public-private partnership.\" \nA few leases already have been signed, he says, and the development group is in talks with \"a couple cool, big users.\" \nThe sprawling former plant, vacant since the 1970s, was established by brothers Robert and Herman Simon, who expanded on their original silk making enterprise in Union Hill, N.J. \nAccording to a historical sign on the Karl Stirner Arts Trail, just across the creek from the site, the facility had an initial workforce of 250 before rocketing to 1,060 in 1899 following an expansion. \nAll of the newer buildings follow the late 19th century Industrial Romanesque style, leading to unity within the complex. \nThe mill eventually grew to include more than 1,200 workers and roughly 1,500 pieces of machinery. \nDery Silk Mill \nCatasauqua's Dery Silk Mill, now a 35-unit rental unit complex, in 1998 received a blue-and-gold historical marker from the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission. \nBuilt in 1897 by silk magnate Desiderius George Deri, later changed to Dery, the three-story, L-shaped mill at Race and Front streets employed 400 workers and was the cornerstone of his silk-making empire. \nBy 1914, Dery controlled 15 mills in this state and one in Massachusetts, employing 4,000 people. By 1919, his mills grew to 42 (17 of them in the Lehigh Valley) with a total work force of 10,000. \nThe capitalist lived in a Greek Revival mansion at Catasauqua's Fifth and Pine streets complete with 48 rooms, 10 baths, a ballroom and swimming pool. He was considered the world's largest individual silk manufacturer before a failed attempt to corner the world silk market in 1920 smashed his fortune. The led to the Catasauqua mill's operations ceasing in 1923. \nLater, during the Great Depression, his financial hardship worsened and he died virtually bankrupt in 1942. \nAccording to a 1985 Morning Call article, building renovations began in 1984, when its exterior walls were cleared of poison ivy, steam-cleaned and repointed. \nThen, all 339 of the structure's windows were removed, stripped, reglazed and reinstalled. \nInside, original maple flooring was restored on the first floor, with spaces being divvied up by dry wall while second-floor duplexes were created by adding beams and suspending lofts. \nAdelaide Silk Mill \nIn 1880, a group of Allentown businessmen seeking economic development courted Phoenix Manufacturing Co. The Paterson, N.J., silk maker was suffering labor troubles and looking for a place to relocate. \nOf the sites Phoenix Manufacturing President Albert Tilt and his staff were shown, one along the Jordan Creek was most appealing, with its cheap water power from the Lehigh Canal, its tradition as an industrial center and its proximity to fast-growing markets in New York and Philadelphia. \nCity businessmen used their own money to help build a new facility for the company at 333 W. Court St., and named the U-shaped building Adelaide, after Tilt's wife. \nConstruction of the mill, which was one of the largest of its time at 235,000 square feet, took place under the supervision of local builders using local labor and materials. Phoenix installed $150,000 of the latest machinery. \nOpening day for Allentown's first silk mill was Nov. 17, 1881. The occasion was marked by an elaborate ball, complete with catering by an exclusive New York restaurant, speeches by prominent political figures and music by the Allentown Band. \nAccording to past Morning Call articles,the Adelaide mill employed 1,900 at the height of its production in the 1900s. \nOperations ceased in 1964 and the building was redeveloped as commercial space for an antique market, fitness facility and other businesses over the years. It sits vacant today. \nIn 2013, the Allentown School Board and Lehigh County Commissioners voted against placing the 8-acre property into a Keystone Opportunity Zone. \nThe decision ended developer Borko Milosev's plans to use the tax breaks to offset some of the projected $25 million cost of converting the two-building complex into 150 apartments and commercial space. \nLehigh County property assessment records show the property is owned by New York-based 333 Court St. LLC. No current redevelopment plans for the site have been presented to Allentown, according to city spokesman Mike Moore.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T02:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T06:42:34.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
