(Frederick M. Brown / Getty Images) Brian Lowry Variety \nNetflix 's Ted Sarandos pushed back against a much-discussed assertion by FX Networks CEO John Landgraf this summer, stating at an industry forum Thursday, \"There's no such thing as too much TV.\" \nSpeaking at the Hollywood Radio and Television Society's annual State of the Industry luncheon, Sarandos, Netflix's chief content officer, noted that Landgraf - who cited a perceived glut of original scripted series that will exceed 400 in the next year - suggested that the only concern would be if distributors were spending vastly more and people weren't watching more content. \nLandgraf, who made his remarks on the same stage at the Beverly Hilton Hotel during the TV Critics Assn. tour, expressed concerns that supply was already exceeding demand, saying that original production is in \"the late stages of a bubble\" that's destined to burst. \nSarandos' comments were characteristic of a generally bullish discussion about the state of the industry, with ABC Entertainment Group president Paul Lee citing his gratification in seeing several old rules banished, beginning with the belief that programs with minority leads can't reach a large audience. Alluding to ABC's success with programs like \"How to Get Away With Murder\" and \"Black-ish,\" Lee said that TV could deal with issues like race and \"really attract a broad audience, and most importantly, you can unleash a huge wave of creativity.\" \nLee also noted that the broadcast networks have found new revenue streams, from program ownership to retransmission fees, to help offset their declining ratings. That said, Sarandos - who reiterated his resistance to issuing viewer data for Netflix - said the network model was flawed and that only dynamic ad insertion (that is, updating ad content within programs to make it timely, whenever it's watched) could help remedy the situation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T17:37:47.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
