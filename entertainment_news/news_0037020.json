MTV EMAs or MTV VMAs: which event is the most outrageous? \nPress Association 2014 / / National Entertainment News Share \nThe MTV Europe Music Awards (EMAs), co-hosted by singer Ed Sheeran and model Ruby Rose, will be held in Milan on October 25. \nOriginally conceived as an alternative to the MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs), the EMAs has a good deal in common with its sister show as both are ultimately a celebration of music. Ed Sheeran ( Joel Ryan/Invision/PA) \nIn addition, there is usually some sort of scandal making headlines around the world, such as shocking language or raucous antics. \nThe EMAs is, at times, perceived as the poorer relation to the VMAs as the latter tends to boast more American A-list stars. But which event is the most outrageous? The EMAs or the VMAs? We take similar themes and compare the two events. 1. Ouch! Politicians bashed \nThe topic of the day at the 1995 MTV EMAs, held in Paris, was French nuclear testing in the South Pacific. U2′s Bono on stage (Joel Ryan/AP/PA) \nU2′s Bono made his feelings about French president Jacques Chirac clear: “What a city, what a night, what a crowd, what a bomb, what a mistake, what a w****r you have for a President.” \nOver at the VMAs in 2008, host Russell Brand implored the watching millions in the US to vote for then Democratic presidential nominee, Barack Obama. He called President George Bush a “retarded cowboy”. Promoted stories Host Russell Brand at the 2008 MTV VMAs (Kevork Djansezian/AP/PA) \nIn both instances, it’s telling that the equally harsh words came from stars on this side of the Atlantic. 2. Now that’s how you make an entrance! \nJennifer Lopez made a show-stopping entrance in a replica plane at the 2000 EMAs in Stockholm. The star ‘flew’ over the audience before landing and performing her hit Love Don’t Cost a Thing. \nAt the 2003 VMAs in New York’s Radio City Music Hall, the most noteworthy entrance came from Beyonce. The singer, dressed in harem pants, was upside down as she was lowered to a couch on the stage to perform Baby Boy. \nJ.Lo’s entrance remains one of the most spectacular, but Beyonce nearly out-did her. 3. The hosts with the most \nWhen P Diddy was at the helm for the 2002 EMAs in Barcelona, he offered a diamond ring to the first woman in the audience to strip naked on stage. Host P. Diddy on stage with a topless girl (Anthony Harvey/PA) \nIncredibly, a young lady took him up on his offer and posed topless on stage dressed only in her knickers. She then grabbed the ring and headed backstage. \nLeave it to Miley Cyrus to do the VMAs equivalent in 2015. The Wrecking Ball singer flashed a bare breast on national television while getting changed backstage, despite the Los Angeles ceremony airing on a delay in order to ensure no bad language or distasteful behaviour. Miley’s racy performance with Robin Thicke at the 2013 VMAs (Scott Gries/AP) \nThis beat her infamous 2013 twerking appearance where she rubbed up against Blurred Lines star Robin Thicke and stroked herself with a giant foam finger. \nHowever, the full-on nudity in Barcelona is a tough one to top. 4. Comic personas rule \nComedian Sacha Baron Cohen hosted the 2001 EMAs as Ali G, but he brought the house down four years later in Portugal when he let alter ego Borat run loose. \n“It was very courageous of MTV to start the show with a genuine transvestite,” he said in reference to Madonna. Sacha Baron Cohen as Borat at the EMAs (Anthony Harvey/PA) \nAs Borat, the Brit went on to introduce the Pussycat Dolls as “international singing prostitutes” and, while talking about pop star Shakira, he said in his native Kazakhstan, her name means vagina. \nNew York’s Radio City Music Hall was once again the venue of choice in 2000 when Wayans Brothers Shawn and Marlon hosted. \nThe duo, best known over here for the Scary Movie films and White Chicks, put their comic stamp on proceedings with a funny parody of Macy Gray video, I Try. \nBut Macy got off lightly compared to those on the end of Borat’s outrageous EMAs shenanigans. 5. Imma let you interrupt, Kanye \nThe 2006 EMAs in Copenhagen saw the birth of a new on-camera phenomenon: Kanye West interruptus. The rapper was so disappointed when he lost best video that he gatecrashed the stage when the prize was presented to Britain’s Justice and Simian for We Are Your Friends. Kanye West complains alongside Jeremie Rozan and Martial Schmeltz (Jon Super AP/PA) \nIn an expletive-ridden tirade, he said he should have won for Touch The Sky because it “cost a million dollars” and featured an appearance from Pamela Anderson. \nIt was not his first meltdown at an awards show (Kanye walked out of the 2004 American Music Awards after failing to win a trophy) and it would not be his last because… \nThree years later in 2009, Kanye gave the VMAs one of the most infamous moments in its history. \nAfter Taylor Swift won best female video for You Belong With Me, which beat Beyonce’s Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It), Kanye stepped up. \nAs Taylor began her acceptance speech, he stormed the stage, took the microphone away from her and broke in: “Yo Taylor, I’m really happy for you, Imma let you finish, but Beyonce has one of the best videos of all time. One of the best videos of all time!” he shouted as a mortified Taylor and a stunned Beyonce looked on. \nThe audience was speechless. Trust Kanye at the VMAs to out-do Kanye at the EMAs. \nBoth ceremonies have provided their fair share of surprises over the years. \nHowever, on balance, if you want an evening of real surprises, stay tuned to the MTV EMAs.
