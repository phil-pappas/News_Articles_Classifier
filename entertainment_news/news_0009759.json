It almost looks like an ascendency into heaven.\" \nThe artist's ability to strike a dichotomy between the abstract and the real was one of the things Martin said drew him to Harris' work.

(Photo by Casey Curry/Invision/AP) \nWhen she asked who the artist was, the entertainer waxed on about the brilliance of this man from Canada whose work from the 1920s to the mid-1930s defined his country's image as the great, unspoiled frozen North. But whose reputation is unknown south of the Canadian border. \nHarris, who died in 1970, turned to abstract expressionism later in life, but this exhibition focuses strictly on his Canada-defining landscapes. \nAfter concluding the artist was someone U.S. arts patrons needed to know about, Philbin approached Martin about curating a show.

But he said that didn't count. \"It's easy to curate your own collection. You just put 'em all in a museum.\" In this Wednesday, Oct. 7, 2015 photo, curator and actor-comedian Steve Martin poses for a portrait in a gallery for the exhibit \"The Idea of North: The Paintings of Lawren Harris\" at The Hammer Museum, in Los Angeles.
