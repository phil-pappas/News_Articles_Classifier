However, with the daily increase of refugees and financial crises taking place in Greece - is the country ready to accept any more refugees? Speaking to People's Post, Anna Stamou from the Muslim Association of Greece (MAG) said Greece was never prepared for this crises.\n“ In Greece, we live in very difficult time, not because of financial crises heard on social media, but because of the many refugees passing through Greece in order to enter Europe,” related Stamou. “It is difficult for us as we have endless over loaded makeshift boats sinking in front of Greek islands. In many incidents these families do not make it, loosing many innocent lives, including babies. This is very sad for all our people – it is a very sad situation for Greece... ”\nStamou represented Greece in the European elections, last year, making her the first Muslim female to do so. “ People do not want to stay in a place with a high unemployment and severe financial crises. People are passing through Greece as this is a gate to enter the European Union to places like Germany and Sweden in order to observe a working force. The Government that we have had since January this year do their best and always try and welcome these refugees, but there are not enough facilities to accommodate them...”\nStamou said refugee camps where set up to host Syrian families, but not all where able to benefit for shelter. “It is impossible to give shelter to all these refugees. Those who could not be accommodated slept at various Mosques.\"\n“ Most of the Greek population are giving these refugees of what they already don’t have. The refugees are also having a hard time due to Greece not having the ability to sustain. Imagine being a country that has no money, but our people are still trying their best in solidarity to raise funds and gather food and clothing for these refugees. Our people are ready to do these things, but its beyond our powers...”\nPolice force\nWhile many refugees had hard times trying to get past boarders and police officials, Stamou related the story of a pregnant refugee who lost her baby after being beaten by police. “This is a result of bad behaviour and this unfortunately will happen. The staff that receive these refugees are not trained to do so,” she said. “In many cases they lost control with refugees because the country was not ready for this. However, police authorities will most likely make evaluation and a decision to fire this person.”\nShe said disputes often occur with impatient refugees trying to get registered. “The forces are not enough to assist the situation and has a very low number of police officers to keep in order. There is a lack of man power and training which leads to very ugly and violent incidents,” she added. “These refugees are very proud people and I am glad that they are filming all incidents, forwarding it to the ministries. No refugee should be treated this way. However, question still remains -how do we deal with this? We are not ready.”\n“ They letting this crises happen in Greece as we are at the low Southern frontier. If this was in Germany, the European union would never allow this. They should act up and draw a policy for refugees. We are talking about peoples lives, dreams and everything. These Syrians left everything in Syria for a better life...”\nIn the meantime Stamou said they are currently communicating with various NGO's to assist refugees in Greece. “We hope to have many more organisations coming on board. Greece needs your help in order to assist these refugees. They are coming in by numbers and this is overcoming us. However, our efforts are there and we are always welcoming to help them.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:39:58.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
