Henson has wowed viewers, critics and even the Television Academy with her portrayal of Cookie Lyon on Fox's hit hip-hop drama, Empire . Now she'll try to tackle a more serious role -- playing Gertrude, the mother of the late Richard Pryor, in Lee Daniel's upcoming biopic about the late, great comedian. \n\"You will see her go from this young, beautiful woman who is a prostitute to someone beaten down by life,\" Henson revealed in the latest issue of CR Fashion Book . \"She has no teeth, no hair -- just a broken woman, everything taken from her. And I love her.\" \nHenson said she took the role because something about Gertrude was frightening. \"I'm drawn to characters that scare the s*** out of me because I know they are going to unearth something in me,\" she said. \nMike Epps will portray the iconic comedian, while Oprah Winfrey will play Henson's mother and Pryor's grandmother, Marie Carter. Eddie Murphy is also in the film as Pryor's father, while Kate Hudson will play his widow. Production is set to begin next March, after Daniels completes work on the second season of Empire . \nHenson is certainly busy lately, with the kind of career most actors would envy. She credits her father for her acting success. \n\"He's the reason I'm an actress,\" she revealed in the fashion magazine. \"I remember calling him one day, so frustrated. I was like, 'I'm not getting anything.' And he said, 'You asked for longevity!\" and I was like, 'Uh, yeah Dad, I didn't think it would take this long.'\" \nThe Emmy Award-nominated actress continued: \"After my first big role, I said, 'Oh my God, Daddy, this is it.' He was like, 'Do you understand that is nothing compared to what is coming for you? That sun is going to crack open and shine so bright.' He looked off in the distance and said, 'You are going to be a sensation.' And I was like, 'What the f*** do you see? I want to see what you see.'\" \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
