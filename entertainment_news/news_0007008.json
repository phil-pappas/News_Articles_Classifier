I feel like I’ve been keeping a secret. It is such a relief to finally tell people and get my belly out...\" That's always the best part - until people have the uncontrollable urge to fondle it in public.\nSpeaking of how young Finn will react to a sibling, she said: \"There will be 14 months between them so they are going to be real Irish twins. I don’t think he will have a clue. I don’t even think there can be a jealousy issue at that stage because he's still going to be a little baby himself.\"\nI've a feeling he got some help with this, but it's still a framer #crèchelife pic.twitter.com/xzxuyaqMKI\n— Karen Koster (@karenkoster) September 10, 2015 Of mammyhood, the 35-year-old added: It’s funny. When I was pregnant with Finn, I had such a set of worries and now I've a whole new set. I know now that I can survive the night feeds and all the labour and that gorey stuff. But now my worries are more like how am I going to go to the bathroom when I have a baby who wants his bottle and I’ve Finn wobbling around? It is going to be busy. We just feel really blessed now.\"\nThe Best Man with The Best Baby pic.twitter.com/V74GdAq33X\n— Karen Koster (@karenkoster) August 23, 2015 Having two under the age of two will be a breeze. It may be double the work, but it's also double the love.\nBig congrats to the happy couple.\nMORE: Carey Mulligan gives birth to miniature Mumford!
