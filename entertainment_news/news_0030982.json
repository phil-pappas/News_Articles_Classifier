(Photo: KHOU) \nIn the days of streaming music, an iconic Houston music store is still going strong. \nSo strong, in fact, it’s about to celebrate a major milestone. \nCactus Music will celebrate its 40th anniversary Saturday. \nThe store has the Beach House and some oldies from the Bobby Fuller Four. In fact, Cactus has pretty much everything when it comes to tunes. \n\"I still come here to find records like this, to experience an album in a whole different way,\" said artist Fat Tony, who was in the store Thursday looking for music. \nThe large number of customers proves how durable it is even after so many similar stores have shut down. \nCactus Music owner Quinn Bishop says 50 percent of his business is now vinyl. (Photo: KHOU) \n\"We went from seven inches to LPs through cassettes to video rentals,\" said owner Quinn Bishop, who has worked here since the mid 1980s. \"All your great music stores, wherever you are, whatever city you are in, they connect with people that love music on a very deep level.\" \nBishop says 50 percent of his business is now vinyl but he insists an independent storefront like this is viable and that digital downloaders also patronize his store. \n\"There's still that customer out there. There's still massive LPs and CDs sold,\" Bishop added. \"Right now, millennials are buying lots of records. There's this perception that it's older people that bought records 30 or 40 years ago and it's simply not.” \nThe first Cactus Music was here at the corner of West Alabama and Shepherd and opened in 1975. In the 1990s, it became a 10,000-square-foot store as CD sales took off. \nHis CD collection now is extensive and the place has live shows but the focus is on vinyl. \n\"This album has 'Fly Me to the Moon' on it which is really, really hard to find. I've been looking all day for this album,\" said Alexis Roberts.
