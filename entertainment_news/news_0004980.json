Paradise. A time before the existence of humans. And one day, one single tiny little bee, a curious and mischievous one, was getting bored of living the eternal life of a mother bee and wanted to try out her stinger, to see what happens. The Princess kissed a frog, poetically speaking, though in reality it was a mother bee, (queen bee) who stung the frog. The Bee's DNA slips into the frog, its eggs mutate, the offspring grows fluff on its skin, which happens to be of the exact structure as bee fur, a new hybrid comes about – out of which a species evolves which will be the only mammal with slit pupils like reptiles and amphibians, the cat.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151016/277877\nLong story short, the cat turns into a great cat and tries something new again and mates with a boar, its natural prey; the result is the first species with Manus, hands, is born – a man. Man evolves into a Homo Erectus, and by the time this new species evolves into a Homo Sapiens and populates the earth, paradise begins to dwindle. The first question asked is why all this happened? Because one single mother bee was so nosy, stung a frog, etc. and involuntarily started the entire evolution process leading to the creation of mankind. This bee's life is the focus of new history thriller The Tall Tale , by award winning author Leagan E. Kasper, written from the point of view of a bee, remembering how it all began and how she stood eye witness to the consequences of having stung a frog, eventually completing the evolutionary cycle by evolving into a human being. The Tall Tale is revolutionary.\nWhat if a single bee was responsible for the human evolution?\nWould the bees be upset with her, now having to work for man?\nThe Tall Tale was released in English and in German, as paperback, the German Title is \" Die Riesen Fabel \" , available at book sellers worldwide and online. Also available as e-book at Amazon.\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Tall-Tale-Truth-Ancient-Times/dp/1517755964/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Tall-Tale-Truth-Ancient-Times/dp/1517755964/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/when-the-bee-evolved-into-a-human-being-is-the-focus-of-the-tall-tale-300161467.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=NY30917&Transmission_Id=201510161934PR_NEWS_USPR_____NY30917&DateId=20151016", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/when-the-bee-evolved-into-a-human-being-is-the-focus-of-the-tall-tale-300161467.html", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151016/277877", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1517755964"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:26:18.099+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
