He's accused of rape by an actress who gave her name as Dottye and molestation by a track coach named Donna Barrett. Dottye claimed she was drugged and raped in 1984 when she auditioned for \"The Cosby Show\" at his New York home. She said she was \"dizzy and disoriented\" after taking a drink from the comedian. She was 30 years old back then. \"Things got foggy thereafter but I do know he took my clothes off and put them in his washing machine,\" the woman said to the press. \"Somehow I ended up on the third floor in the bathroom as Cosby washed me.\" \"I want people to know, I did not go to the police because at that time, I thought somehow I had let him do what he did,\" she said. \"I didn't protest and I was too embarrassed to tell anyone of this shame I felt. Anyway, he was Bill Cosby. Who would believe me?\" Meanwhile, Barrett met Cosby in an event at the University of Pennsylvania in 2004. She posed for photographs with friends when the star grabbed her from behind and forcefully pulled her backside into his private parts. \"I complained to other officials but no one knew what to do,\" she said. Both women were accompanied by Gloria Allred who represented many females with similar accusations against Cosby. \"I can assure Mr. Cosby that there are still more victims who will be courageous enough to come forward in the future,\" the lawyer said. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T17:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T21:57:45.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
