I was just asking a question, and then you're the one who's jumping in!\" Fallon yelled over Cyrus on the \"Tonight Show.\" \n\"Talented,\" Fallon said. \n\"Yup,\" Cyrus replied. \nBut perhaps the best one wasn't as much an emotion as it was a grave mistake. Jimmy pretended he thought Cyrus' first name was \"Morley.\" \n\"I get tickets and I go see you, and the crowd's all screaming, 'Morley, Morley, Morley!'\" Fallon said. \nAnd let's just say Mi-ley wasn't too happy about it. \n\"I am an international phenomenon and my name is Miley and everyone knows that,\" Cyrus said. \nIt's hard to argue with that statement. Miley is currently promoting her new album, which she released for free online. (Video via Smiley Miley Inc. / Miley Cyrus ) \nAnd she'll be hosting the season premiere of \"Saturday Night Live\" this week. \n\"Here's what I'm wearing,\" Miley said in a promo for the show, holding up a tiny piece of fabric. \n\"So, no pants?\" Taran Killam said. \n\"What are pants?\" Miley replied. (Video via NBC / \"Saturday Night Live\" ) \nBut right now, she's showing Jimmy (or is it Jormey?) who's boss. \nThis story includes images from Getty Images.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T09:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:46:57.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
