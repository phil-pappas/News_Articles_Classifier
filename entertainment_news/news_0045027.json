The march took place under the leadership of Maharaj Yadav of Madhesi Morcha in Birgunj in Nepal on Monday. \nThe Madhesi people earlier in the day have sought moral help from India and its interference in resolving the matter, but till now India had kept herself out of the frame and had only appealed to maintain peace in the region. The Madhesh, which occupies 17 per cent of the Terai area of the country, constitute to 51 per cent of the total population of Nepal. Of the total population of Nepal, in Terai, 69 per cent are Madhesis while 31 per cent are non-Madhesis, that is people from hills migrated to Terai.

We want to send our voice to Kathmandu. We want our rights, we will fight for them.” The Madhesis who are protesting against the newly formed constitution seek more power and rights for their communities. According to the new constitution, the Madhesis are only citizens by descent would be able to hold important government post, which has not been accepted by the community. \nSecond most important thing that the new constitution states under the previous provision, Madhesis, with more than 50 per cent of the population, got 50 per cent of seats in Parliament. but now the phrase has been omitted in the new Constitution. Madhesis seeks re-insertion so that they continue to have electoral constituencies in proportion to their population. Though there are other specific reasons behind Madhesis are protesting, they want a clear statement from the newly appointed communist Prime Minister of Nepal K P Sharma Oli and also wants omitted provisions to be mentioned again. \n  7:54 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:01:11.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
