The network denied it was filming Lamar Odom who was fighting for his life in a Las Vegas hospital after found unconscious at a Nevada brothel. The basketball player reportedly overdosed on drugs and suffered a \"loss of oxygen\" and \"possible stroke\". \" ' Keeping Up with the Kardashians ' is not currently shooting in Las Vegas',\" E! said in a statement to TheWrap Wednesday, October 14. \"Lamar Odom appeared on several seasons of 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians,' as well as two seasons of his own series ' Khloe & Lamar .' We are saddened to hear of his condition, and are sending out thoughts and prayers for his recovery.\" Khloe reportedly visited her ex-husband at the Sunrise hospital, even flying in Lamar's father, ex-wife and his two children to be on the former NBA player's bedside. Kim Kardashian and Kris Jenner joined Khloe for the Tuesday visit and were seen leaving the hospital with grim faces. Tabloid reports said cameras were rolling inside the hospital room. Despite filing for divorce from Lamar two years ago, Khloe still got his back. An episode of \"KUWTK\" earlier this month showed her getting a call from Lamar who was grieving the death of his best friend Jamie Sangouthai. \"Lamar has suffered so much loss in his life,\" Khloe said at that time. \"I'm always going to be there for Lamar, especially when something as tragic as this happens ...I'm really on high alert for Lamar because anything will set him to spiral and that's kind of the last thing I want for him.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com More Keeping Up with the Kardashians News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T02:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:13:08.566+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
