The studio reportedly eyes British actress Gugu Mbatha-Raw to star in the upcoming \" Star Wars Episode VIII \". Gugu will join other three actresses who are up for the same role. Tatiana Maslany (\" Orphan Black \"), Olivia Cooke (\" Me & Earl & the Dying Girl \") and Gina Rodriguez (\" Jane the Virgin \") were previously reported to be in the shortlist of a female lead. Newest report says that Gugu will join those actresses and they are actually competing for not just one, but two roles that both have the same shortlist. The characters are said to be both substantial. Recent rumors said that Tatiana, Olivia and Gina would do chemistry tests with \" Star Wars: The Force Awakens \" star John Boyega , so probably his character will play a big role in the eighth episode. Benicio del Toro will also star in the upcoming movie, but he remains unsure whether his role is a villain. \"Star Wars Episode VIII\" is directed by Rian Johnson and is produced by Kathleen Kennedy, Lawrence Kasdan and Simon Kinberg. The movie is slated to be released in the U.S. on May 26, 2017. Following her critically-acclaimed performances in \" Beyond the Lights \" and \" Belle \", Gugu has become a high-in-demand actress. She will next be seen in NFL drama \" Concussion \" alongside Will Smith and was reportedly eyed to star in \" Robin Hood: Origins \" opposite Taron Egerton . \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Star Wars Episode VIII News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T07:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:22:37.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
