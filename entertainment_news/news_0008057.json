To be honest, we feel kind of lucky that we've got to this point and never cancelled one (a show). So obviously, we're all very disappointed and very, very much apologise to everyone who was there. \n''But it happened so late because we were trying to get on and it was just impossible. He wasn't well enough. We very very much apologise to everyone. We're disappointed ourselves as well.'' \nThe promoter has confirmed the cancelled show will now take place on Friday (23.10.15) and the two other shows scheduled for tonight (21.10.15) and tomorrow evening (22.10.15) will take place as planned. \nIn a statement, they said: ''We thank everyone for their understanding and their good wishes to Liam.'' \nFans unable to attend Friday's show will be offered refunds. \nThe group - which also includes Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson - also took to Twitter to apologise to their supporters, with Niall writing: ''So sorry we have had to cancel tonight guys. Unfortunately these things happen... Thank you to all who came down tonight !
