At times, the audience heard upright bass, guitar — even a hint of jazz piano, for a second — as well as his several songs from the banjo ukelele. Fleck has also recently finished composing a concerto for banjo and full symphony orchestra, which is just another example of his wide-ranging musical talent. \nFleck and Washburn, who are married and have a son together, are touring now after releasing their first record as a duo. Fleck explained to the crowd that they have two completely different playing styles, but their diversity rounded out their performance, with their unique sounds blending together for something otherworldly. \nIt was a diverse setlist, with traditional folk and bluegrass numbers interspersed with Fleck's instrumentals, a fantastic cover of \"I've Been Working on the Railroad,\" some of their individual work and even a banjo rendition of a traditional Chinese song from Sichuan, China — Washburn is fluent, though Fleck says every time she speaks Chinese with someone, \"It sounds like they're having an argument.\" \nThe performance even got a tad political, with Washburn giving a heartbreaking a capella performance of \"Come All You Coal Miners,\" originally written by Sarah Ogan Cunning to rally coal miners to unionize for better labor conditions. The only light in the hall was the spotlight resting on Washburn, and the silence was palpable between notes — the audience was transfixed by her breathy higher register and powerful lower notes, which flowed out of her mouth like water. Truly, she should be known just as much for her singing ability as her banjo playing. \nAt one point, it seemed they may have had some mixing issues, with Washburn's vocals coming in a tad soft. She even motioned off-stage to have her microphone turned up, which seemed to fix the problem. Some may have also had issues with the amount that Fleck and Washburn chatted about their songs and joked with the audience — more than many musicians usually include in a show — but the audience seemed to find the glimpse into their lives interesting. \nAnd goodness, do Fleck and Washburn love Goshen. The couple decided to donate all of their merchandise proceeds to the Goshen College Community School of the Arts, and they attended a \"Music Together\" class at the school with their 2-year-old son Juno before taking the stage, said Music Center Executive Director Marsha Yost before the show. They even planned to have a day off to spend in Goshen on Wednesday, golfing and visiting Shanklin Park, Washburn said mid-performance. \nAnd Goshen's reputation for singing well seems to get around, highlighted most recently by \"A Prairie Home Companion\" leader Garrison Keillor calling his Goshen show in May his favorite show ever, mostly because of the singing ability of the crowd. Fleck and Washburn included several numbers in their show for audience sing-along, including a moving rendition of the spiritual \"Divine Bell,\" where audience members delivered with a four-part harmony that rung from the rafters. The smiles on Fleck and Washburn's faces showed that they had just as much fun as the audience during Tuesday night's performance. \n(574) 235-6209", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T16:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T00:18:21.234+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
