Abrams, \"the highlight of my Comic-Con, probably one of the highlights of my life.”\nThe Force Awakens , in theaters Dec. 18, is expected to be one of the biggest movies of the year. Superfans already crashed ticketing websites with early sales, so it's no surprise Lucasfilm and Disney arecourting the series’ devotees — the “ Star Wars fandom.”\nUSA TODAY\nFord, concert add force to 'Star Wars' panel\nThe idea of “fandom,” a community of people who share a passion for a piece of entertainment, isn’t new. There were Trekkies for Star Trek . There were the lines outside the theaters for the first Star Wars flick. There was Beatlemania.\nBut in recent years, fans have become an undeniable force in entertainment. They drive business decisions, power movies at the box office, save shows from cancellation and come together in the thousands and hundreds of thousands online and at events like Comic-Con. Comic book fans can look forward to more than 20 superhero films hitting theaters between now and 2020. Cult shows such as Community and The Mindy Project have found second lives online. And just this month, New York Comic-Con set an attendance record with 167,000 fans converging on the Javits Center. We are now living in a world where “fan culture” is a universe all on its own.\n“As kids everyone is pretty much geeky,” says Leigh Lahav, creator of the popular animated YouTube series Fangirls , which centers on a group of fictional young women and the media they love. “It's when you find yourself, at a certain point, growing up and getting more and more into these obsessions when others drift away that you realize this is something unique that has to have a name.”\nA scene from the upcoming 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens.' (Photo: Lucasfilm)\nFan culture not only has a name, it has organization. It has community. It has purpose.\n“It’s not bachelors and bachelorettes living in their parents' basements anymore,” says Dean Plantamura, a member of the 501st Legion , a Star Wars stormtrooper costuming organization that boasts a roster of more than 8,000 members across the USA.\n“It’s definitely become more popular,” he says. “People are just realizing that it’s fun. There has been a cultural shift.”\nBut as much as fans find community online, they are also likely to run into some negativity in that same space — especially women, people of color or LGBT fans.\n“(Fan culture) exploded so quickly that the people that have been here the longest — a very small subsection of them, specifically white dudes — feel like they're being invaded,” says Donna Dickens, editor of HitFix Harpy, HitFix.com’s “fangirl headquarters.” “They felt that it was just for them, and now the popular kids have come and taken it away.”\nUSA TODAY\nThe Mothership: When nerd rage becomes outrage\nIn recent years, instances of conflict and at times harassment have drawn fan culture into the spotlight — in particular GamerGate , a troll harassment campaign aimed at women in the video game world that began in fall 2014 and continues in various forms today. Prominent targets of the campaign, including feminist video game critic Anita Sarkeesian, have had had their lives threatened.\n“When women and people of color can't show up to (conventions) without fearing for their lives, that's when you're like, 'This is insane and it has to be stopped,'” Dickens says.\nShe is quick to note, however, that fandom isn’t the only subculture where negativity makes headlines. There’s plenty of positivity in there, too. But “that's a feel-good story you would write about once,” she says.\nAs the Internet has brought like-minded fans together for the first time, it also has drastically narrowed the gap between the people who love art and the people who create it.\nABC Family's 'Pretty Little Liars' draws one of the most passionate and committed fandoms around. (Photo: Eric McCandless, ABC Family)\nSocial media empowers fans to shout their opinions 140 characters at a time, and sometimes the will of thousands is too much to ignore\n“We would be not bright people if we ignored giant trends (on Twitter) that we see,” says Marlene King, executive producer of hit ABC Family show Pretty Little Liars . “Our stories are well-plotted out in terms of mystery, but I will say that a relationship could suffer death by Twitter if kids really didn't like that couple.”\nMarc Guggenheim, an executive producer for the CW’s Arrow , says fan opinion can influence a show, but in a more indirect way.\n\"I don’t think it’s possible for any showrunner to say qualitatively that they take in the feedback and ignore it completely,\" he says. \"The danger of the topic is when you get into a binary situation where we’re either affected or we‘re not affected.\"\nBut he did point out that there is a group of fans who very directly influence the show.\n“(The writers) are probably the biggest fans around,” he says. \"We approach these shows really from that perspective.\"\nPlus, he notes, “without the fans watching, there’s no show.”\n34 CONNECT 13 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1S6vn5S TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6df2a59f17e745791e28e8d92ed56525ea8f3ef8/c=330-0-2443-2113/local/-/media/2015/07/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/635721701116660105-Star-Wars-Fisher-Hamill-Ford.jpg", "http://www.501st.com/index.php", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c63c831a1658ad74ec0f5e8f9c605732e2f4431a/c=235-0-3862-2727&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/25/USATODAY/USATODAY/635813716685323305-EPA-USA-COMIC-CON-2015-74364612.JPG", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1S6vn5S&text=Superfans%20are%20shaping%20entertainment&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/20756d175e5b095227a7e41dc57475ea2d727234/c=824-0-4104-3280/local/-/media/2015/05/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635666969122002196-v2-black-widow-AVENGERS-AGE-ULTRON-MOV-jy-5953-.JPG", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IErBgfATPTA", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1S6vn5S&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/25/USATODAY/USATODAY/635813716685323305-EPA-USA-COMIC-CON-2015-74364612.JPG", "http://usat.ly/1S6vn5S", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/72232bbbfcae86c05b9be39dd13c07698b803b00/c=0-0-533-401&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/25/USATODAY/USATODAY/635813719542325619-635808758670199993-EP7-IA-38176-DJ.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/521cd80a4fb9f1f1edf37d025629b379daee5bba/r=500x332/local/-/media/2015/10/25/USATODAY/USATODAY/635813716685323305-EPA-USA-COMIC-CON-2015-74364612.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1fb74b3984801e91d6cd90db0884b90b822a2b6c/c=172-0-2828-1997&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/25/USATODAY/USATODAY/635813720254314183-XXX-PRETTY-LITTLE-LIARS-GASP-4312--63115768.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-26T20:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:46:27.178+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
