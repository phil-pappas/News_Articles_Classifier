The 37-year-old Sehwag has been on the forefront of many of India’s greatest wins over the last decade and was a part of India’s victorious T20 World Cup in 2007 and the One-Day International (ODI) win in 2011. Also Read: 6 Records held by Virender Sehwag \nSehwag will retire as India’s only triple centurion (He has two to his name) and the second player to score a double century in ODIs. Widely hailed by modern day bowlers as one of the most destructive players in the game, Sehwag cared scant little for technique and relied on his hand-eye coordination to bullet the ball to the boundary ropes. This news comes days after another key figure in the Indian camp, Zaheer Khan bid adieu to the game. After being dropped from the ODI and Test side in 2013, he has struggled for form in domestic cricket too, which made a comeback nigh on impossible with the likes of Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan clinching the opening slot in the shorter formats. \nSehwag leaves behind a glittering legacy, being an extension of the ‘Master Blaster tag’ that Sachin Tendulkar had created in the 1990s. There were calls for bringing back Sehwag for the ICC World Cup 2015 but it failed to materialise for the ‘Nawab of Najafgarh’. \nWhen Sehwag, who was present alongside Brian Lara, Graeme Smith and Azhar Mahmood at the launch, was asked how he could play as Masters Cricket League (MCL) is a retired cricketers’ league, Sehwag said “If I am not retired I will not play. I will go back to India and announce my retirement.”MCL is supposed to be played in February next year, which means that Sehwag will complete his Ranji Trophy commitments with Haryana before joining the veterans’ league.In a glorious international career spanning over 12 years, Sehwag played 104 Tests scoring 8586 runs at an impressive average of 49.34, hitting 23 centuries and 32 half-centuries.
