(PRWEB) October 02, 2015\nAuthor Richard Meza shares an unforgettable experience that will help readers realize how faith in God, accompanied by hard work, determination and unity, can move the heart of God. He invites them to join this life-changing journey through the pages of “ Building Up the Temple ” (published by Xlibris).\nA young and inexperienced pastor got to witness firsthand God manifesting himself mightily in a small church, how the workings of the Lord on the small but spunky congregation were peculiar yet tremendous, and how the project could not have been carried out without the faith of the many people who could not understand the words “give up.” Through the eyes of Meza, who witnessed the strange but undeniably wonderful experience of God’s power, readers will learn the story of the church of Mendota .\nThe church was built by hardworking families who had a many years’ dream of building a beautiful sanctuary, daring to believe that with prayer and fasting and a lot of hard work, they could touch God’s heart. As a testament to their strong faith and the power of prayer, they had been allowed by God to build a beautiful seven-thousand-square-foot sanctuary in just seven months. Even through the midst of turmoil, God was able to confound the wisdom of man and demonstrate that he is truly a God of miracles.\nAn inspiring and spiritually enriching read, “Building Up the Temple” proves how faith can help people triumph over tremendous obstacles.\n“Building Up the Temple”\nBy Richard Meza\nHardcover | 6x9in | 104 pages | ISBN 9781514408209\nSoftcover | 6x9in | 104 pages | ISBN 9781514408216\nE-Book | 104 pages | ISBN 9781514408223\nAvailable at Amazon and Barnes & Noble\nAbout the Author\nRichard Meza was raised in the Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles during the late 60s. He became a minister in 1973 and, eventually, a pastor in 1984. He married Tabitha in 1977, and they had three children: Ashly Elizabeth, Richard Jr. (Richie) and Isaiah Silvestre. Most people call him pastor which he considers a term of endearment. After 38 years of marriage to Tabitha, he considers himself the luckiest man in the world. During their years of pastoring, Richard and Tabitha were associate pastors in Escondido, built the church in Mendota and established a new church in Bonita. They retired in 2012 due to various health issues.\nXlibris Publishing, an Author Solutions, LLC imprint, is a self-publishing services provider created in 1997 by authors, for authors.
