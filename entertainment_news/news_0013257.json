The integration allows a selection of deployment options including running zero-infrastructure APIs with AWS Lambda, or with backend services including AWS EC2. Optional extensions for both methods include perimeter protection against DDoS attacks, API acceleration through content caching with CloudFront, and enhanced monitoring with CloudWatch. The integration is available now on all 3scale plans from free through enterprise.\nFor more on the integration offerings and a tutorial, visit http://www.3scale.net/amazon-gateway-integration/ . 3scale will be providing a demo at AWS re:Invent in Las Vegas, October 6-9, 2015 at Booth 753.\n“3scale already supports managing APIs on AWS through our Amazon Machine Image ( AMI ) available through the AWS Marketplace -- but these new integration options take Amazon API Gateway management to new levels,” said Steve Willmott, CEO of 3scale. “API providers on AWS won’t have to switch infrastructure to supercharge their gateway functions including DDoS attack protection, basic caching and logging. Now they can easily add the fine-grained API control, visibility and developer adoption and promotion features of the market leading 3scale API Management Platform.”\nAWS customer Basis Technology selected 3scale to manage their forthcoming Rosette API, which delivers multi-lingual text analytics as a service. Looking for a solution that provided a flexible foundation for growth, Basis chose 3Scale. Gregor Stewart, VP Product Management at Basis Technology said, “3scale provides us with just the functionality we need at a very competitive price, and it integrates well with our API infrastructure stack running on AWS.\"\nAll of the 3scale + Amazon API Gateway scenarios share a basic flow:\nAn API request from an external API consumer calls the Amazon API Gateway public endpoint and is internally redirected to a 3scale Authorization Function implemented in Lambda The function calls the 3scale API Management Platform for API key authorization 3scale authenticates traffic, and ensures access rights and rate limits method and client levels Subsequently, API call flow for authorized calls is continued by accessing the actual API implementation; either on Lambda or an other HTTP endpoint Finally, successful execution of the whole API flow - both request and response - is reported to 3scale and can be seen in analytics\nIn a Gartner report entitled IT Market Clock for B2B Solutions 2015, analyst Paolo Malinverno assessed, \"With digital business and the Internet of Things (IoT) mounting as the next big trends, and the central role APIs will play as part of them with consumers outside the enterprise, we have only seen the beginning of cloud API management. Without proper API management, organizations risk loss of productivity, efficiency and integrity of their information processes. 3scale’s offering has a distributed architecture that allows more deployment flexibility and control than a pure cloud based model.\"\nAbout 3scale\n3scale makes it easy to open, manage, distribute, control, and monetize APIs.
