She and husband Sean Lowe welcomed 50 fans and 20 beauty bloggers to the unveiling of the lifestyle brand's new discovery retail concept. \n\"The consumer wants more storytelling and a more interactive experience,\" said Stéphane De La Faverie, senior vice president and general manager of Origins, while carrying trays of juices and small bites from True Food Kitchen swirled around him. \"The company is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, and Houston is the first of many rebranded stores.\" \nCatherine explained that Origins has tapped into what she's always valued in a beauty brand, \"Natural ingredients, pretty packaging and giving back to the community.\" \nIndeed, Origins has partnered with Global ReLeaf, a project which supports the restoration of forests, and replanted more than 600,000 trees globally since 2009 in conjunction with the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge. \nAlthough the new concept reveal marked Catherine's first trip to the Bayou City, Sean visited a friend recently in The Woodlands. This time around, the couple stayed at the nearby Hotel Derek and binged on prosciutto pizza. \n\"The next logical step for us is ... babies!\" Sean revealed. \"We just don't know when yet.\" \nCatherine shared that she's also looking forward to holiday travel. The reality television stars are planning a trip to her hometown of Seattle so that she can spend time with her sisters. \n\"We went to Hawaii three weeks ago,\" Catherine said. \"I'm trying to convince Sean to take me back a few times a year from here on out.\" Entertainment News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T00:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:27:18.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
