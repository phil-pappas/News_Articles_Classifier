If I walk out the door and don't look at least good and presentable they're gonna use that shot forever.'' \nKim shot back: ''You're not forced, this was a choice.'' \nThe pregnant reality star recently admitted she is jealous of Caitlyn's new boobs following her gender transition earlier this year. \nSpeaking on an upcoming episode of 'Keeping Up With The Kardashians', Kim told her sister Khloe, 31: ''I went to Caitlyn's photoshoot, she was pretty, like really pretty.'' \nShe added: ''I went into the closet and she had to change and she was like, 'You can stay.' And she took off her top and her boobs were like [sister] Kourtney's when she first had them done. Like, it made me want a boob job.'' \nKhloe, who has admitted she's having trouble remembering what pronoun to use when discussing Caitlyn, asked with a shocked expression on her face: ''She has full implants?'' \nKim replied: ''She has a full boob job...like a C.''
