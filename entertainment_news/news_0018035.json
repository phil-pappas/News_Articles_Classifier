AP PHOTOS: Promoting James Bond from 'Dr. No' to 'Spectre' File - In this Aug. 1, 1972 file photo, Roger Moore poses for a photograph at the Dorchester Hotel in London, after the announcement that he would play James Bond in \"Live and Let Die.\" Moore was the first Englishman to play Bond. Aided by his natural charm and comic timing, Moore's seven Bond films were more light-hearted than those that had gone before. His films saw a proliferation of gadgets, which grated with many Bond fans. The upcoming new Bond film \"Spectre\" starring Daniel Craig has its World Premiere on Monday Oct. 26, 2015, in London.
