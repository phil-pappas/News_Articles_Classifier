It was a crazy night of \"Dancing With the Stars.\" I don't know if it was guest judge Maksim Chmerkovskiy, the return of host Tom Bergeron, that there was no elimination this week, that co-host Erin Andrews was wearing a knock-out sequined dress or that the new partners worked wonders with their celebs. Whatever it was, the ballroom was rocking and hot, hot, hot!! Alexa PenaVega and Derek Hough earned a perfect score as partners during 'Dancing with the Stars' Switch Up Week. (ABC) \nAlek Skarlatos got all steamy with Emma Slater for a close and personal rumba, and Paula Deen flicked up her skirts at new partner Mark Ballas in her best dance yet. And tonight's scores went astronomical -- Bindi Irwin and Val Chmerkovskiy scored three 9s and a 10 for a sunny, sassy cha cha, and Alexa PenaVega and Derek Hough's tango topped the quickstep by Carlos PenaVega and Lindsey Arnold by one point -- a perfect score of four 10s for Alexa over the three 10s and a 9 for Carlos! Wow! There was even a sighting of former SF Giants closer Brian Wilson, beard and all, in the audience! \nTop Three Advertisement \nFirst of all, I must put Alexa and Derek at the top. They received four perfect scores for their tango and deserved every bit of that. Judge Carrie Ann Inaba gave them a standing ovation and Maks said she was a \"leading lady\" after getting out of her own head and letting go. It was a spectacular routine that included members of the DWTS Troupe. Just before Alexa and Derek danced, her husband Carlos and Lindsey performed a quickstep that absolutely took my breath away. It was fast, furious and not a step was missed. Judge Bruno Tonioli said it wasn't a quickstep, it was a \"turbostep.\" Although Maks called it not a great quickstep, but an amazing quickstep, he only gave them a 9, robbing the pair of the perfect 40. It's comparing apples and oranges, but I think Carlos' quickstep was every bit the perfect routine that Alexa's tango was. Too bad he didn't get the score. It's just too difficult to deny Bindi's natural dancing ability, and this week's cha cha with Val was terrific. She was able to do some really difficult steps and stayed smiling, and with the scores combined with last week's scores, she is still on top of the leaderboard. \nOh My \nI loved the rumba by Alek and Emma, but he just couldn't loosen up and show the emotions that he showed during the practices. And for that reason, he didn't get high scores although he danced well. Maybe he will eventually relax and show the emotions of the dance he is doing. And although she dances very well and gives it her all, Tamar Braxton's lack of facial expression and connection with her partner, whether it's Louis Van Amstel like tonight or Val, her regular partner. She could have scores up in the 9s and 10s, but instead she scored three 7s and an 8 for a great samba with intricate choreography. \nTom took a moment at the end of show for a tribute to his father, who died last Monday. \"My dad loved this show. He never missed one and I like to think that somewhere he didn't miss this one,\" said Tom, choking up. \nNext week will feature routines inspired by movies and music videos, and the guest judge will be Olivia Newton John. Hmmm, I wonder if there will be anything from \"Grease.\" See you next week -- keep dancing. \nCelebs and partners (scores, plus last week's scores) \nBindi and Derek: 9; 9; 10; 9 = 37 (out of 40) + 28 = 65 \nCarlos and Witney: 10; 10; 9; 10 = 39 + 25 = 64 \nNick and Sharna: 9; 9; 8; 9 = 35 + 27 = 62 \nAlexa and Mark: 10; 10; 10; 10 = 40 + 21 = 61 \nAndy and Allison: 9; 9; 9; 9 = 36 + 23 = 59 \nHayes and Emma: 8; 8; 7; 7 = 30 + 27 = 57 \nTamar and Val: 7; 7; 8; 7 = 29 + 27 = 56 \nAlek and Lindsay: 8; 7; 7; 7 = 29 + 24 = 53 \nPaula and Louis: 7; 7; 6; 6 = 26 + 18 = 44", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T09:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:47:50.523+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
