Describing the plot, Sruthi, who has been involved in the independent films sector for quite some time now, says, \"The film is based on a conversation between a female entrepreneur and a boy who washes cars for a living. It's about happiness drawing up different meanings for different people, and how small things can lead to greater joys in life.\" Speaking of shorts, in general, she says that these films could be an interesting addition to the video portfolios of young actors.\n\"A lot of evolution is taking place in this genre, which is a welcome trend, but more should be done to encourage short filmmaking in Karnataka,\" says Sruthi. Shajan, whose earlier documentary films — The Resilient Bangalore Traffic Cop and Sukrupa — dealt with socially relevant topics, says that ABC essays the dichotomy between two extreme yet simple individuals. It shows how for some people, life is about triumphing against all odds, while for some, life is only about complexities. While ABC literally translates to 'accelerator, brake and clutch', the meaning is more symbolic — new beginnings in life.\nABC also features Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic) MA Saleem's 11-year-old son Shahbaaz in a lead role. Shajan is hoping to create an ecosystem for short filmmakers and help nurture compelling narratives as well as resonating acting skills.\nShahbaaz, who attended a 10-day training session in acting ahead of working in the film, says, \"It was a fun and interesting character to enact. The film is about hopes and aspirations. I want to work in more such independent cinematic projects.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:19:23.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
