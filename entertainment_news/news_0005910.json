It was amazing to say the least.\"\nNot much later a friend of his bought a brand new 1965 goat.\n\"It was the coolest car ever,\" said Lyczak. \"Pontiac had this reputation for speed and endurance. I wanted one.\"\nHe purchased his first GTO, a 1964 example, from Rizza Ford in Riverside. The Azur Aqua coupe packed the 389ci/325hp V8 and a four-speed.\nThe young man was thrilled about his new ride but his father, not so much. The pair frequently took long road trips to Mercer, Wisconsin, to fish together. \"He was skeptical if the used car would make it up there. Of course I said yes, not knowing if it would or wouldn't,\" chuckles Lyczak.\nHe convinced his dad the second-hand muscle machine was reliable but another close individual found another fault. The GTO wasn't optioned with AC and Lyczak regularly cruised with the windows down.\n\"My girlfriend didn't like her hair getting messed up,\" said Lyczak. To preserve the relationship, he sold the GTO in 1970. A 1970 Impala, optioned with air conditioning, went in its place.\nDespite the brevity of the one year of ownership, his love for Pontiac's rolling icon never wavered.\nIn March 2015 Tom Korbas, a childhood friend and well aware of Lyczak's GTO love, called. He had a lead on a vehicle for sale in Ingleside, California.\n\"He didn't ask, suggest or recommend. His exact words were, 'Here's your car. Call him and buy it,' \" said Lyczak. His buddy's hunch proved right. Lyczak wasted no time in completing the purchase, sight unseen. The GTO was built in Fremont, California, and sold new at Utter Pontiac, in Los Angeles. A highway patrol officer by the name of Marvin Lucky bought it for his wife. Frustrated at finding parts, he sold the car in 1984. A second owner flipped it within a few weeks. The third owner, Mike Radke, oversaw the engine rebuild, which took place in 1996.\nLyczak isn't shy about driving the classic, taking similar trips like he did when he was younger. His favorite times were \"revving up and down Ogden\" and motoring to such memorable destinations as Top's Big Boy and Duke's. \"I'm not shy about pounding the gears, just like I used to,\" said Lyczak. \"Although I don't remember them guzzling this much gas.\"\n• Email comments, suggestions to auto@dailyherald.com.
