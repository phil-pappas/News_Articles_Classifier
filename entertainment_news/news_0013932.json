Some are old ladies, witch doctors from Louisiana, kids that have just left art school. Gay or lesbian couples, straight middle-aged couples…” she explained of her own fans’ unique qualities. \"I have that throbbing energy, and I accept it, and I harness it\" @FKAtwigs #Nowstalgia http://t.co/M0UKC4LtUg pic.twitter.com/y7Dz7OeYGh \n— PAPER Magazine (@papermagazine) October 7, 2015 \nTwigs, who is dating Twilight star Robert Pattinson, said her Gloucestershire upbringing had given her different ambitions. \n“I’m quite traditional. You know that saying, ‘You can take the girl out of the country but you can’t take the country out of the girl?’ \n“I grew up in Gloucestershire, and there’s a certain format that people fit into. And I’m actually quite happy with that format.

Make sure you’re in the right catchment area’,” she said, although she remained tight-lipped on who that future husband could be. \nShowing off her toned figure in a bodysuit, Vivienne Westwood flatform shoes and little else, the Two Weeks singer said she doesn’t keep her sexiness on the down-low on stage.
