Photo: Supplied \nThe biggest names in commercial radio partied like it was 2013 at the industry's annual awards on Saturday night.\nFour of the Australian Commercial Radio Awards top honours – the equivalent of a silver or Gold Logie – were handed to the same winners from two years ago. Indeed, most of the class of 2013 – Kyle Sandilands and Jackie O, Ross Stevenson and John Burns, Neil Mitchell, and Brendan Jones and Amanda Keller – already have a shelf groaning with ACRAs.\nAt the lavish Gold Coast function, hosted by actor and comedian Stephen Curry, The Kyle and Jackie O Show was named best on-air FM team for the fifth time since 2006. It's the hosts' first win since they defected from 2Day FM to Kiis FM, causing their former station's ratings to plummet.\n3AW's Ross Stevenson, left, and John Burns were named best on-air AM team for the fourth time. Photo: Source: Twitter \nDespite Sandilands reputation for controversy, he's (mostly) kept his nose clean at Kiis. Recently, the broadcasting watchdog dismissed a complaint prompted by him calling agriculture minister Barnaby Joyce a \"wanker\", a \"ponce\" and a \"gerbil of a thing\" during an interview.\nAdvertisement Melbourne's top-rating breakfast team, Ross Stevenson and John Burns of 3AW*, won best on-air AM team, having taken out the prize in 2011, 2013 and 2014.\nNeil Mitchell, 3AW's morning host – inducted into the ACRA Hall of Fame in 2007 – claimed best current affairs presenter for the fourth year running.\nAmanda Keller and Brendan Jones claimed another ACRA for their syndicated program, My Generation. Photo: Supplied \nThe weekly My Generation , also a 2013 victor, got another best syndicated Australian program gong. The show is hosted by WSFM's popular breakfast presenters, Brendan Jones and Amanda Keller.\nBen Fordham of 2GB, who recently left Channel Nine's Today show, got his second consecutive best talk presenter prize.\nTriple M Sydney's Paul Gallen, captain of the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks, won best newcomer on-air and Nova's drive program Kate, Tim & Marty won best networked program.\nOther major winners include Smooth FM's Ron Wilson (best FM news presenter); FIVEaa's Anne Stone (best AM news presenter); 3AW's Tim Lane (best sports presenter); Nova's Tim Blackwell (best music or entertainment presenter) and Nova's Fitzy & Wippa (best community service project).\nVeteran broadcaster and award-winning journalist Jeremy Cordeaux was inducted into the Hall of Fame. Cordeaux, now FIVEaa's afternoon presenter, has spent more than five decades in print, television and radio.\nThe awards are organised by industry body Commercial Radio Australia. A panel of judges – comprised of representatives from all radio networks, and from the advertising, marketing and engineering industries – chooses the winners.\n*Fairfax Media, publisher of this article, owns or has interests in stations including 3AW, Magic, 4BC, 2GB, 2UE and 6PR.\nFULL LIST OF 2015 ACRA WINNERS Note: category winners are denoted with the following letters: Country>Provincial>Non-Metropolitan>Metropolitan\nBEST ON-AIR TEAM – METRO FM \nKyle & Jackie O Show;
