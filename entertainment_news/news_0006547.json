(AP) - Two friends say they rescued a dog by rappelling more than 100 feet down a mine shaft in Southern California.\nMichael Schoepf and Nick Gladden were off-roading last week near Lake Mathews, about 60 miles southeast of Los Angeles, when they discovered an abandoned mine and shined a flashlight into it. They saw a pair of eyes looking up at them.\nUsing sections of nylon rope tied together, Gladden carefully lowered Schoepf down. Schoepf tells the Press-Enterprise newspaper ( http://bit.ly/1NenBoF ) that the pit bull climbed right onto him and he brought the animal to the surface.\nKeri Berka of Happy Tails Animal Hospital says it treated the dog for some scratches and traumatic glaucoma in its left eye, which could have happened if it fell down the shaft.\nThey hope to find the animal's owner.\n___\nInformation from: The Press-Enterprise, http://www.pe.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
