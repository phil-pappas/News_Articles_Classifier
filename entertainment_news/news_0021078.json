Speaking at a press conference, Simbu severely in his criticized Vishal. Simbu attacked Vishal saying he blame for the division in the Nadigar Sangam. The young star went on to accuse Vishal of splitting the Nadigar Sangam because of his personal issue with Sarathkumar. Also present at the press conference were Radhikaa, Simbu, Urvashi, Bhagyaraj and his wife Poornima.\nAn emotionally angry Simbu said, \"I have been in this industry since I was a 9 months old child and I will not tolerate someone new coming in and breaking the cinema family. I won't be quiet watching all this.\nReferring to Vishal's objection to leasing the Nadigar Sangam building out to SPI cinemas to construct a theatre among others, Simbu questioned if Vishal could make a career in films without theatres. Responding to Vishal's argument of there are schools in the locality, Simbu asked, \"Is theatre a TASMAC (liquor) shop?... If a theatre can't come up there, what else should be built there? A bar or a club? ...Will a true cinema-loving theatre owner ever screen a film of yours tomorrow?\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:28:57.582+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
