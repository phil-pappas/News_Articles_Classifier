And he and everyone else has to cope with the film’s gee-whiz, sentimental tone that leads to ideas such as having Petit narrate the film standing on the torch of the Statue of Liberty. \nBack we go to Paris in 1973, and Petit’s life as a unicycling mime, wire walker and street performer who steals croissants off tourists’ tables (3-D makes this look even hokier than it sounds) and is always looking for “the perfect place to hang my wire.” \nThat quest leads him to the beautiful Annie Allix (“The Hundred-Foot Journey’s” Charlotte Le Bon), a street singer who falls under Petit’s spell even though by all appearances he is an arrogant, irritating, not particularly likable fellow. \nStandard issue flashbacks show us the beginnings of Petit’s interest in wire walking and introduce us to his first teacher and mentor, Papa Rudy Omankowsky of the famous White Devils aerial troupe (played with altogether too much brio by Ben Kingsley.) \nIt’s in a dentist’s office, of all places, that Petit has his eureka moment when he sees a magazine story about the soon-to-be-constructed World Trade Center towers. He steals the article, takes it home and draws a pencil line between the buildings. “With this tiny pencil, I sealed my fate,” Petit says with his usual portentousness. “This was the birth of my dream.” \nCompletely obsessed with the towers, Petit begins to gather people he calls “accomplices” for what he visualizes not as a mere performance but as a spectacular “coup,” something he is sure will be considered “the most audacious work of art.” \nOnce in New York, Petit investigates the rhythms and systems of the towers as rigorously as the French jewel thieves in Jules Dassin’s “Rififi” case their target, and he gathers more accomplices. These include the French-speaking Jean-Pierre (James Badge Dale) and the dramatically whiskered Barry Greenhouse (Steve Valentine), the expedition’s inside man. \nThe closer “The Walk” gets to Petit actually getting on the wire, the more interesting it becomes, and the film’s final 20 minutes, when you see the aerialist going back and forth and back and forth with all of Lower Manhattan unfolding beneath his feet, are alternately mesmerizing, exhilarating and terrifying. \nGordon-Levitt took an intense week of wire-walking lessons from Petit himself, and he managed the simpler walking on his own. For trickier maneuvers, however, double Jade Kindar-Martin stepped in, with the filmmakers digitally replacing his face with the actor’s. \nGetting the city that appears under Petit’s feet to look real was the work of a small army of digital technicians led by visual effects supervisor Kevin Baillie and his Atomic Fiction organization. Baillie’s team of 15 took three months to create the city and the twin towers, followed by five months of work by more than 100 CGI artists to integrate that world with the walking footage. \nIt would be swell if all of “The Walk” came together as beautifully as the computer effects do, but it would also be churlish not to appreciate what we do have. This film may not talk the talk, but it definitely walks the walk, and for that we are grateful.
