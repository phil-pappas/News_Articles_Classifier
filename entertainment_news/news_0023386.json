The pop star admitted to outrage, and also addressed the images directly with an apparently playful — if not a bit defensive — joke. \n“My first thing was like … how can they do this? Like, I feel super violated,” Bieber told Billy Bush in an interview set to run later this month. “Like, I feel like I can’t step outside and feel like I can go outside naked. Like, you should feel comfortable in your own space … especially that far away.” \nAnd in terms of the photos that hit the web? “That was shrinkage for me,” the singer said with a laugh.

Part 1 of the “Access Hollywood” interview airs on Oct. 19; Part 2 is Oct. 29.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T19:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:55:06.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
