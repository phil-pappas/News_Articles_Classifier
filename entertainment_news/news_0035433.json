Other signs noted that \"All sales are final.\"\nManagers at the store declined to confirm the closing to The Beacon-News Friday.\nGeneral Manager Olena Kutsan said the company likely will make a statement soon.\n\"They are going out of business,\" said Aurora Alderman Carl Franco, 5th Ward, after talking with store officials. \"The general manager said they just didn't have enough traffic going through.\"\nHe said store officials intend to meet with Mayor Tom Weisner and Aurora city staff soon.\n\"Everything is a little bit in flux,\" Franco said.\nCosmopolitan Marketplace opened earlier this year amid great fanfare – in part because the store was opening in a remodeled former Lowe's in a key shopping spot at the corner of Orchard Road and Indian Trail on the far West Side, and in part because it was a different grocery store concept that also sold goods besides groceries, included a full bar and an atmosphere some likened more to a dance club than a store.\nCosmopolitan Marketplace in Aurora may close Steve Lord, The Beacon-News Cosmopolitan Marketplace opened on Aurora's far West Side earlier this year. Cosmopolitan Marketplace opened on Aurora's far West Side earlier this year. (Steve Lord, The Beacon-News) A main feature of the grocery was its meat market, which was popular. Franco said apparently many shoppers would buy meat there, but for some reason would shop elsewhere for other groceries.\nThis was the first of its kind, and at one time, store officials planned on opening another Cosmopolitan Marketplace somewhere in the northern suburbs. It is unclear if that still is the plan.\n\"It's disappointing,\" Franco said. \"I thought Cosmopolitan being unique would be good, but maybe it was too unconventional.\"\nStill, he called the intersection and mall there \"a great spot,\" and said there still are plans for other businesses to build stores there. Also, a fitness company might still be interested in the section of the former Lowe's that was the garden section.\n\"(The city) is going to push for that spot,\" he said.\nslord@tribpub.com\nCopyright © 2015, Aurora Beacon-News Aurora", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562babaf/turbine/ct-abn-aurora-cosmopolitan-st-1025-20151023", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562babb0/turbine/ct-ctl-ct-abn-aurora-cosmopolitan-st-10-2-jpg-20151023"], "published": "2015-10-24T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T23:05:44.591+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
