I'm going to hang out with friends. Write new music. Maybe not write new music. I don't know.\" During the interview, Taylor also reveals she struggles with doubts about her hugely successful career, and relies on her mother for advice. \"If you let your anxiety get the better of you, like everybody's waiting for you to really mess up, then you'll be done,\" she adds. \"A lot of the time I call my mom and talk for a really long time, just to remind myself of all the things that are great and that matter.\"\nIt has been a huge year for Taylor so far both personally and professionally - as well as her big-selling tour, she also went public with her romance with Calvin Harris and was credited with changing the music industry by forcing Apple bosses to backtrack on a payment policy for artists signed up to their Apple Music streaming service.\nWENN Newsdesk 0 comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T17:14:03.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
