A man laments the loss of his girlfriend. Two best friends fall in love; a married couple tumble out of it. \nAll of the stories are told with a touch of magic realism. \n“It’s beautifully and honestly written,” Taylor said. “There’s something for the audience to take away from each scene, whether it’s a new lesson about love or just a reminder.” \nThe play works particularly well in the intimate, 121-seat Electric City Playhouse. \n“I thought it was perfect for the Electric City Playhouse community and the space they have,” Taylor said. “Allowing actors to be so close to the audience helps us to tell the story.” \nIt’s also the sort of play that benefits from minimal scenery and props, Taylor said. \n“My goal is to keep it as simple as possible,” he said. \n“Almost, Maine,” which broke box office records in its premiere run in Portland, Oregon in 2004, is particularly popular with colleges and schools and has become the most produced play in North American high schools, supplanting Shakespeare’s “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” The comedy’s inclusion of a same-sex couple sparked protest and resulted in the play being canceled in one North Carolina high school last year. \nTaylor’s staging features a local cast of twentysomething actors who have performed in Anderson and Greenville but are all new to Electric City Playhouse. The cast includes Levi Adkins, Jessie Davis, Amber Ensley, Amber Gilliard and Sean Hackle. \nTaylor, a 2012 graduate from Anderson University with a degree in theater and graphic design, is the co-founder and artistic director Anderson’s “24 Hour Musical,” which produces an annual show to benefit charity as well as other events and fundraisers. \nTaylor and his wife are working to create a new theater troupe in Anderson: the Market Theatre Company, with a debut planned for 2016 in downtown Anderson. \nThe theater would produce a range of family shows, musicals, plays, improv comedy and concerts. \n“We want to offer entertainment for everyone and opportunities and creative challenges for artists,” Taylor said. \nFor the latest in local arts news and reviews, follow Paul Hyde on Facebook and Twitter: @PaulHyde7. \nYOU CAN GO \nWhat: “Almost Maine, “ by John Cariani \nWhen: 8 p.m. Friday-Saturday; also 8 p.m. Oct. 23-24; also 3 p.m. Oct. 18 and 25 \nWhere: Electric City Playhouse, 514 North Murray Avenue in Anderson \nTickets: $18 adult; $16 seniors; $10 students \nInformation: 864-224-4248 or ecplayhouse.com 10 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://grnol.co/1LwbR1m MORE STORIES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:14:55.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
