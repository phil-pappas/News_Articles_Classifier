The last two years of my life have put a different sort of rocket fuel up my backside.” Promoted stories \nLooking back on her 20s, she admitted: “You can get away with having one too many vodka tonics, and you can wake up in the morning and not have a puffy face. \n“I couldn’t go out now and get rip-roaring drunk; I’d take a week to recover and I value my life too much. Plus, I have children.” \nMother-of-three Kate also revealed that her 14-year-old daughter Mia would like to follow her mother into acting, which she said is “amazing”.
