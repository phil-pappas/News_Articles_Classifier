I enjoy having songs that anyone can feel they can relate to. \"I never want to alienate. But again, with using male pronouns, it's great, it's cool, but using pronouns in general isn't always necessary.\"MNEK is currently working on his full-length debut album after releasing his Small Talk EP earlier this year, which included the singles 'Every Little Word', 'Wrote a Song About You' and 'The Rhythm'.The singer has also been lending his songwriting talent to a range of other artists' albums, including Madonna, Little Mix and Kylie Minogue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:39:25.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
