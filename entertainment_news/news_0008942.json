It eliminates the need to hold the camera at armâ€™s length, as well as avoids having to leave someone out of a shot. It also allows for more convenient and versatile storage, display and sharing of photos. It sown social network will be included eventually.\nThe original design was submitted to the Las Vegas office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
