Contributed Local Real Estate Cars For Sale \nFOLK at its best, delivered with four-part harmonies, mandolin, ukulele, accordion and guitar, is the weapon of choice of this deadly team of musical agents called All Our Exes Live in Texas. \nElana Stone, Katie Wighton, Hannah Crofts and Georgia Mooney are the current members of the band. \nKatie Wighton said they band has been together for almost three years now. \n\"A friend was putting on a gig at the Vanguard in Sydney and he said he would love us to create a band for the gig, and since we were all friends already, we did. The rest, as they say, is history,\" she said. \n\"We were having fun and we love singing together. Georgia brought the mandolin, Hannah, me and Elana had played our instruments before but not a lot, but we just picked them up and run with it, and it's been going strong.\" \nThe musician said folk music was a genre she and sister Georgia were familiar with from an early age. \n\"Georgia and I were probably more familiar with folk as a genre. Our mum is a singer so we grew up listening to artists like Linda Ronstadt, Joni Mitchell, Joan Baez and that kind of female folk singers,\" she said. \n\"We all love harmonising and that is how it all started.\" \nThe ladies also have an interesting set of spoons with their faces as part of the band's merchandising. \nThe band is preparing to release their debut album next year, after releasing their eponymous debut EP earlier this year. \nAt the Mullum Music Festival, November 19-22.
