Rough Cut (no reporter narration)   \nROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) The blind Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli has sold 85 million albums and is the best selling singer of all time on the classical charts, but at age 57, this year could be shaping up into one of his biggest ever. Bocelli, who rocketed to stardom in the early 1990s in part as a protégé of the late Luciano Pavarotti, explained in an interview with Reuters on Saturday (October 10) that he will release \"Cinema\", an album of songs from movies ranging from \"Maria\" in \"West Side Story\" to \"Brucia la Terra\" (Burn the Earth) from \"The Godfather\", on October 23. He said that he loved the music of the movies because it was like a \"big field where composers can run where they want and be free.\" The album includes a duet version with pop princess Ariana Grande of \"E Piu Ti Penso\" (The More I Think of You) from \"Once Upon a Time in America\". He explained that singing with Grande had been a treat, in part because his two sons are big fans of the former teen actress turned singer. Bocelli's wife, whose voice he describes as \"sweet and sensual\" also features on a duet on the album. Bocelli's global stardom has afforded him opportunities to sing for world leaders, including his first performance for Pope Francis when the head of the Roman Catholic church was in Philadelphia during his recent U.S. visit. But he said it is also a huge honour that his millions of fans worldwide fill stadiums to hear him.  //reut.rs/1ZvYR1X", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:07:38.651+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
