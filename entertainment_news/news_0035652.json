The 18-year-old model, who had admitted that she had temporary lip fillers to make them plumped, recently revealed she's so over big lips and wanted her small lips back. The reality TV star made the shocking confession in a new makeup tutorial video on her website and app. \"You know what's weird? I've been into small lips lately,\" she said, \"Like I want them to look small.\" Kylie revealed on \" Keeping Up with the Kardashians \" in May that she got lip fillers because her lips had been an insecurity for her. She later shared secret to her natural-looking plumped lips, \"I still do Juvederm for my lips. I go to Dr. Ourian in Beverly Hills, and he's super natural about it.\" The lips aside, Kylie revealed she might soon enter the movie business. Tyga 's girlfriend said, \"Just got off the phone with: my mom. We talked about a movie script,\" but it's unclear in what capacity she will be involved in the project. Kylie recently supported her sister Kendall Jenner at Balmain x H&M Collection Launch in New York City. Kylie made a cameo at the Tuesday, October 20 event, while her elder sister modeled the collections on the runway. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T09:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:38:56.470+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
