Photo: Supplied \nThe Libertines \nANTHEMS FOR DOOMED YOUTH (EMI) \n★★★ \nRehabbed and reformed, but only partially renewed, the first Libertines album in 11 years finds the London four-piece turning between the glorious raucousness of youth and the tempered truths of 30-something survival. Songwriters and frontmen Carl Barat and Pete Doherty, the perpetual tabloid press fixture free at the moment of drug addiction, still have a feel for a peculiarly English excess – violence and historic conjuring, romantic dedication and maudlin self-destruction – that's entertaining, if sometimes piecemeal. Bands that captivated youth culture, as the Libertines did in Britain, rarely recapture past glories, and the best songs are those that suggest a new path, whether it's the heartfelt ballad You're My Waterloo or the straight-ahead Fury of Chonburi​ , which offers some otherwise scarce guitar racket. Looking back only provides for nostalgia on Dead for Love , and while they're happy to namecheck Cromwell and Orwell in the same line the Libertines fare best with focus instead of finery. CRAIG MATHIESON \nAdvertisement Luke Escombe and the Corporation \nCREEPER VINE (Dri-Clean Only) \n★★★&frac12; \nYou may not hear much you haven't heard before in the way of chord patterns, but the melodies to Luke Escombe's songs certainly hook you in and his love of acerbic or plain funny satire elevates his lyrics far above the pack. As he sings his mighty voice is in constant animation, spitting one moment and crooning the next, and at its best his guitar playing is a bit like ball lightning: an unexplained electrical phenomenon. This version of the Corporation (with drummer Jamie Cameron, veteran bassist Harry Brus and pianist/organist Michael McGlynn) is in thundering good form across the EP's six tracks, the pick of which is the Tom Waits-tinged and very black Axe in the House . It may not be Escombe's finest batch of songs, and it would be great to hear him playing around with form a little more, but, hell, it's still a steaming pile of fun. JOHN SHAND \nThirsty Merc \nSHIFTING GEARS (MGM) \n★&frac12; \n\"Love's a picture so immense, it's bigger than Ben Hur,\" sings Rai Thistlethwayte​ on Thirsty Merc's fourth record. Thirteen years into a satisfying career in (very) soft radio rock it's unlikely the Mercs will start straining for originality now but a Ben Hur metaphor seems particularly lazy given the opportunity for parochialism. We have big things here, too. Such as prawns, pineapples and merino sheep. Lyrics such as, \"I'll buy an ice-cream with you I'll share\" on That's Right Shoogie infantilise fans who slapped down cold, hard, adult cash to record this album (the band reached their crowd-funded goal in 48 hours) but at least the piano has some Elton John zip to it. I'm Crazy , meanwhile, makes serviceable use of Joey Santiago's guitar tone. It is the ballads closing the record that sink it, though – so repetitive, poorly sung and predictable that even the thirstiest crowd-funder may be bored into buyer's regret. KATE HENNESSY \nWards Xpress​ \nTHE BACK ROADS (Independent) \n★★★ \nIt is a bold move to independently release a \"best of\" – who determines whether or not it actually is, other than the artist themselves? That chutzpah is admirable, however, when the music is rock solid. Ross Ward, guitarist and vocalist for Australian blues stalwarts Wards Xpress, has backed himself with The Back Roads , and come out on top. Covering tracks from the band's five releases from a career spanning 20 years, this one is a collection of gritty and muscular pub blues. Ward switches between electric and lap steel, the latter providing a hard-edged, thunderous groove, his voice gravelly and strong. A revolving cast of players backs him throughout a set that shows off the music's evolution from hard'n'fast to slower and more considered. Truly a best of. SAMUEL J. FELL \nThe Jungle Giants \nSPEAKERZOID​ (Amplifire) \n★★★ \nThe Brisbane indie scene has always had strong pop sensibility; from the Go-Betweens to Custard and Regurgitator, and recent additions Ball Park Music and the Jungle Giants. Perhaps hooky melodies come easily in the heat. On the Jungle Giants' second album, Speakerzoid , the band reunites with producer Magoo, erstwhile collaborator with Custard and Regurgitator. The record is split in two. The first half keeps guitars at the fore, as on the loud and frantic Devil's Play or jangly Kooky Eyes , while the second half takes a turn with frontman Sam Hales, a drummer turned guitarist/songwriter, syncopating handclaps and distorting drums for a '90s Beck feel. Combined with Hales' lax vocals it works for some tracks, creating a breezy and light-hearted vibe, but elsewhere breezy feels lazy, and light-hearted is frivolous and shallow, allowing whimsy to whitewash Speakerzoid , and never truly inviting you in.
