Iran's late leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa, or religious edict, calling for Rushdie's death in 1989, and the book is widely banned across the Muslim world.\nIran has offered a $3 million reward for anyone who kills Rushdie. It also said it would boycott this year's Frankfurt Book Fair over a planned opening speech by the India-born British novelist.\nReligion & Beliefs Arts & Entertainment Salman Rushdie Saudi Arabia Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:04:34.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
