And that whimsical element in his large-scale paintings is what caught the eye of Los Angeles collector Stefan Simchowitz. He saw pictures of Armstrong’s work online, and then viewed one up close and personal in the hands of another collector in L.A.\n“Two years ago he called and wanted to see more of my work. He particularly liked my dinosaur painting,” said Armstrong. “He ended up buying five or six paintings. He wanted me to come to L.A. and I met his family.”\nThat business connection was what helped Armstrong get his first solo show that wasn’t based in Ohio. It was with the Robert Blumenthal gallery on Madison Avenue in New York City, and Armstrong presented about 10 dinosaur works there.\n“Three years ago I quit my job and at the end of every month I was always broke, so it was a little scary at first,” said Armstrong, who has a 5,000-square-foot, three-room studio space at the Linden Davis Building in Dayton. “But once you meet the right people and get into the right markets, things seem to flow a lot better.”\nShortly afterward, he started selling at least one major painting a month outside of Ohio. These paintings start with a simple, childlike figure from an old drawing he, his brother, or his son, Jackson, has drawn. He works the same figure over and over, lets it gel for awhile, and then adjusts the composition and adds a bit of color.\n“Most of my artwork is based on drawings and familiar things I grew up around. Drawings my brother and I did when we were young were framed and put up immediately, because all kids’ art is precious,” said Armstrong, whose dad, George Armstrong, retired from teaching art at Fairborn High School, and after several years returned to teaching, this time at Stivers.\nArt is big in the Armstrong family. His older brother, Noah, is an art director for a substantial company in New York. Armstrong calls him “the best painter in the world, but he only does one painting every two years.” Another aspect of bigness is the big bucks that Armstrong is receiving for his works these days. He’s sold two works in Los Angeles for $20,000 to $25,000.\nGallery owner Marta Gnyp was in L.A. and saw one of Armstrong’s paintings, liked it, and bought it. She called Armstrong a few times, and then he saw her again at a major art show in Venice, La Biennale di Venezia. From that contact, Armstrong now has a show at the GNYP Artspace in Berlin, “Boy Meets Girl” with Rose Wylie. The eight works he sent for that dual show have already sold.\nIn the past year he’s also shown works at Art Basel Miami, and the Night Gallery Museum in L.A. Coming up, he has a Munich group show, a show in Rome this March, two NYC galleries in June, and Berlin again in 2016.\n“I’ve always known where I wanted to be, and knew I would do better selling my paintings outside of Ohio,” said Armstrong. “Money makes things easier, because then I can just concentrate on my work and not have to worry about anything. But there’s an old saying, ‘The more money you have, the more problems you have.’”\nMore News Hot topics From Our News Partners Bacon poses same cancer risk as cigarettes, world health group claims Cats are wilder than dogs, not just more aloof, study shows Biking behind bars: Female inmates battle weight gain Giant prehistoric shark teeth washing up on North Carolina beaches Ben and Jerry's debut beer-flavored ice cream", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/DaytonLiederkranz2015\\", "http://bit.ly/Murfbooks2015\\", "http://bit.ly/CityOfPiquaGolf\\", "http://bit.ly/Kim2015\\", "http://bit.ly/DaytonBar\\", "http://bit.ly/GasBuddyDN\\", "http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/daytondailynews/hottopics/medley-bootstrap.js\\", "http://bit.ly/DaytonAirport2015\\", "http://bit.ly/Sharkeys2015\\", "http://www.wsoctv.com/news/news/national/giant-prehistoric-shark-teeth-washing-north-caroli/nn8r6/", "http://bit.ly/DearbornCountyTour\\", "http://bit.ly/PretzelFestival2015\\", "http://bit.ly/WarrenCtyKustoms2014\\", "http://host.coxmediagroup.com/cop/digital/sites/common/js/cmgo_right_rail_addons.js\\", "http://bit.ly/UCBMA2015\\", "http://bit.ly/InfinitiofCinci\\", "http://bit.ly/DorthyLane2015\\", "http://bit.ly/OhioChallenge\\", "http://www.news965.com/news/lifestyles/health/bacon-poses-same-cancer-risk-cigarettes-world-heal/nn8xk/", "http://bit.ly/ABetterYou2015\\", "http://bit.ly/CassanosJuly2015\\", "http://www.krmg.com/news/lifestyles/pets/cats-are-wilder-dogs-not-just-more-aloof-study-sho/nn8wb/", "http://bit.ly/CassanosAnniversary2015\\", "http://bit.ly/ObererKablesMill\\", "http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js", "http://bit.ly/BentleyChiro2015\\", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js", "http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/cx/rss/www.wpxi.com/feed/lifestyles/biking-behind-bars-female-inmates-battle-weight/fCG9Kw/", "http://bit.ly/ContinentalHiringDrivers\\", "http://bit.ly/ObererHome\\", "http://bit.ly/SpringfieldAntJune\\", "http://bit.ly/StudebakerNursery\\", "http://bit.ly/Meijer2015\\", "http://bit.ly/GasBuddySN\\", "http://bit.ly/VinkletWinery\\", "http://bit.ly/LottoRewards\\", "http://bit.ly/AltoHealth2015\\", "http://bit.ly/1vpKREt\\", "http://bit.ly/FlyDirect\\", "http://bit.ly/NetdemicsQuiz\\", "http://bit.ly/StanleySteamer2015\\", "http://bit.ly/WestMainDialysis\\", "http://bit.ly/CityofMoraine\\", "http://bit.ly/Cassanos1015\\", "http://www.actionnewsjax.com/news/business/ben-and-jerrys-debut-beer-flavored-ice-cream/nn8pr/", "http://bit.ly/tigerjoes\\", "http://bit.ly/RhythmandFoods2015\\", "http://bit.ly/GasBuddySWG\\", "http://bit.ly/ObererWashingtonTrace\\", "http://bit.ly/SidneyShelbyChamber\\", "http://bit.ly/Allie2015\\", "http://bit.ly/MiamisburgHS2015\\", "http://bit.ly/LifeConnection2015\\", "http://bit.ly/DaytonVAHealthBenefits2\\", "http://bit.ly/1KQC9Y7\\", "http://bit.ly/ObererSomerset2015\\", "http://bit.ly/FairbornCornFestival\\", "http://bit.ly/sunroomsdayton\\", "http://bit.ly/OhioSoybean2015\\"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:42:37.263+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
