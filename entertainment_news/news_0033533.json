What an elegant performance from @will_young31 ! Come back & see us again soon! #Strictly ðŸŽ¤ pic.twitter.com/QlXqRj7TvE \nâ€” BBC Strictly (@bbcstrictly) October 18, 2015 . @will_young31 s trying to get on the show next year with that audition. #scd #strictly \nâ€” David George (@DeebeeInTheSky) October 18, 2015 \nThere was mixed reviews about the song though. What the hell was Will Young even singing? #Strictly \nâ€” âœ¨Fiona Rubyâœ¨ (@MissFionaRuby) October 18, 2015 Will Young's new single is great #scd pic.twitter.com/CgixjsJPPv \nâ€” Matt PK (@PSKMatt) October 18, 2015 Will Young is redefining bland. We'll all remember where we were when we first heard this happen. #Strictly \nâ€” Sam Delaney (@DelaneyMan) October 18, 2015 \nAnd everyone was worried about the length of his trousers. Quite like this tune but I don't understand Will Young's trousers #Strictly \nâ€” Joanne S (@jojosim) October 18, 2015 Mum and Dad say Will Young looks like a penguin with those trousers. #Strictly \nâ€” Peter Cannon (@PeterJohnCannon) October 18, 2015 \nWe wondered where 13 years had gone. Will Young hasn't aged in the slightest since first being on TV. \nâ€” Michael Clegg (@MJClegg) October 18, 2015 \nAnd of course, Steve Brookstein found a reason to remind us he still exists, and heâ€™s still bitter. Will Young managed by Simon Fuller who employed Simon Cowell. I was managed by Tim Byrne who was employed by Simon Cowell. \nâ€” Steve Brookstein (@stevebrookstein) October 18, 2015 Bye bye Daniel (BBC) \nMeanwhile, back to the dancing, Kirstyâ€™s reaction to being told she was in the dance off was classic. Omg Kirsty is sending daggers through my tv ðŸ˜± #Strictly @bbcstrictly \nBut it was all agreed the judges made the right decision about it being the end of the road for Daniel. And these people had some entertaining observationsâ€¦ Daniel O'Donnell â€“ Like Cliff Richard, but less edgy. #Strictly \nâ€” Ghoul Scarigan (@PDarigan) October 18, 2015 Daniel looks like a wax work of himself. #Strictly Share article \nâ€” Sven Eleven (@shaunroddis) October 18, 2015 Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T00:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T04:33:33.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
