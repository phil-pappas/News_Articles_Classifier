The footage, which is naturally blurry, shaky and completely out of focus, sees a series of skyscrapers floating on a bed of clouds - essentially making it look like they're either in the clouds themselves or they've got no base.\nSee for yourself.\nAlthough it would be very cool if we had cloud skyscrapers, the reality is a lot more mundane. The phenomenon is known as Fata Morgana mirage. It's quite rare, but there's been a few instances of it.\nThe supposed ghost ship The Flying Dutchman was, in all likelihood, a Fata Morgana mirage. It's quite common around especially cold areas and is known to be a regular occurrence in Antarctica.\nAccording to Wikipedia, the process works by rays of light bending when they pass through air layers of different temperatures in a steep thermal inversion where an atmospheric duct has formed. A thermal inversion is an atmospheric condition where warmer air exists in a well-defined layer above a layer of significantly cooler air. This temperature inversion is the opposite of what is normally the case; air is usually warmer close to the surface, and cooler higher up.\nNothing interdimensional, quasi-reality or unexplained about it at all, really.\nVia YouTube\nMORE: Watch: Here's how to make a tiny (completely drug-free) cloud with your mouth\nMORE: Scratching noise in woman's ear turns out to be spider weaving a web\nMORE: Pic: Rock formation on the Moon looks like a human face", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/1KVsrDHUo-I", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KVsrDHUo-I"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:51:49.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
