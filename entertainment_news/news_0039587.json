He struggles with a social worker to recount a blurred, better forgotten history.\nOutside the shelter one morning, he wakes from under a blanket to see prep school kids taking his picture, as if he’s an exotic creature.\nHammond may be damaged, but he knows who his daughter (Jena Ma­lone) is and that she works in a Soho bar.\nGere’s low-key efforts work, especially when seducing an old acquaintance (Kyra Sedgwick) now homeless or reaching out to his estranged daughter.\nUltimately, this is a haunting look at a life, like many, very much on the edge.\n(“Time Out of Mind” includes sexual situations.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:29:28.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
