The glue expands like bread,\" he said while holding samples of the different stages in making the clothes.\nThe high temperature makes the glue mold the pleat into the material. The result on the catwalk was wavy pleated tops, knee-length dresses and skirts, cut at the bottom like curves, that softly moved along with the models wearing them.\n\"We made this material three-dimensional so if the model (is) walking, it is (a) jumping dress ... People can see movement,\" Miyamae added.\nIn another look, the fashion house, founded by Japanese designer Issey Miyake in the 1970s, presented colorful block jackets, pencil skirts, dresses and handbags adorned with fringes.\nThe inspiring tropical fauna theme was evident in the line's color palette - coral, aquamarine, orange, dark pink and yellow. The line itself was called \"Botanical Delights\".\nParis Fashion Week runs until Oct. 7.\n(Reporting By Reuters Television in Paris; Writing by Marie-Louise Gumuchian in London; Editing by Toby Chopra)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:24:46.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
