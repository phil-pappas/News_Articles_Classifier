Photo by: Darkside Haunted house For 18 years, Darkside Haunted House has been terrifying Long Island from its home in Wading River, and after a trip through this house of horrors there can be little question as to why Halloween lovers have returned year after year. A great deal of detail and attention has clearly been put into each set, affording haunt goers a chance to celebrate the season by taking in the wonderfully spine-chilling atmosphere in equal stride as they jump, scream, and run from the monsters lurking around every bend. Featuring an outdoor trail through a haunted village and a full sized indoor haunt there is plenty to see at Darkside, and plenty to run from screaming in terror. Highlights Darkside features an outdoor haunted trail and an indoor haunted house, both of which are as long independent of one other as some whole Halloween attractions, for a single price. Line Queue Entertainment You may find a few creepy creatures walking around the line and interacting with the audience. Mr. Z will liven up the crowd as you approach the end of the line, and there are concessions available along the path as well (coffee and hot cocoa were a welcome discovery on a cold night). If you come in a group and have someone to hold your place in line, you can consider taking a coffin ride while you wait! Overall Length: 20 Minutes, roughly 10 minutes each for the haunted trail and haunted house. Appropriate For: The haunt is not recommended for anyone under the age of 10 and parental discretion is definitely advised for younger participants, but family-friendly daytime matinees are available on most Saturdays and Sundays. Ticket Pricing: General Admission - $23.00 Fast Pass - $33.00 Group Admission (15 people or more) - $18.00 Location & Visibility: The haunt is easily visible from its location on 25A, and has staff with traffic wands out front to guide you into the parking lot. Parking: Parking is free, and there is plenty of room in the lot next to Darkside. A Deeper Look Since its inception nearly two decades ago, Darkside Haunted House has grown to become one of Long Island’s most iconic haunted attractions, and for good reason. Each set is expertly crafted, the actors are all passionate and energetic, and the scares will have even the most seasoned haunt veterans jumping out of their shoes. With two distinct segments—an outdoor trek through a haunted village, and an indoor journey through the Darkside Haunted House itself—this attraction is well worth the price of admission. Those brave enough to come to Darkside will be greeted first by Mr. Z, an enigmatic ringleader who entertains the crowd while preparing patrons for their trip into darkness. Once he lets the guests through they will find themselves outside a small cemetery full of headstones and other creepy objects. Before long they will come to the haunted village, a rundown town appearing to have been ripped straight out of the Old West. Though the ramshackle settlement looks to be a ghost town at first glance, its deranged residents quickly make themselves known to their new guests. Clearly something has gone horribly awry in the village, as many residents issue passersby a warning to turn back or take the poor souls with them; others are quite angry to see a group of trespassers on their property and chase the intruders away with violent cries and sinister intent. The small wooden houses are all built to make guests feel as though they are wandering through an actual rundown village and filled with subtle notes that add markedly to both the theme and overall eeriness of the haunt. Halloween enthusiasts would do well to admire the craftwork here, though that will certainly leave you even more open to attack and surprises from the psychotic men and women who call this town home. After escaping the haunted village, guests will come to the Darkside Haunted House itself—a home filled with monsters, ghouls, and fiends ripped straight from your nightmares. Though the outdoor trail felt like a complete Halloween attraction unto itself, this is where our own group felt the fear was truly ratcheted up to a horrifying level. Shortly after being welcomed into the decrepit mansion, visitors are ushered into a rickety old elevator and brought down to the dark depths of the unnerving home. Here they will meet all manner of terrifying inhabitants, some of them tortured and others menacing, but all frightening in their own way. It is not just the house’s residents who will scare its guests, however; Darkside itself will confuse, disorient, and startle visitors on its own, going so far as to rob them of their sight at several turns. Expect a plethora of quality scares when you enter, but no amount of preparation will save you from all the frights this home has instore. Located in Wading River, Darkside may be relatively far east for many Long Island residents, but it is well worth the trip. The haunt is packed with all manner of creative sets for Halloween celebrators to appreciate and unforeseen shocks to exhilarate thrill seekers. Our group took about ten minutes apiece to make it through both halves of the haunt and loved every second of it, though you may make it through a little quicker if you spend less time admiring the scenery and more running from the monsters!
