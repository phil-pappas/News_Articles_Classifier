Please leave’,” said Kunal at a promotional event of the film here.

Directed by Shantanu Ray Chhibber and Sheershak Anand, the film also features Payel Sarkar and Aparna Sharma. The film will clash at the box office with Kunal’s wife Soha Ali Khan and Vir Das starrer “31st October”. Both the films are slated to release on October 30. \nModified Date: October 13, 2015 6:26 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T15:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:19:50.618+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
