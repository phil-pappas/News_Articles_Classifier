Unlike Bollywood, where music is expected to be an instant chartbuster, I got to do a lot of melody in this album. Since this was a period film, it gave me scope to experiment with my work,\" Bhatt told. For someone who has predominantly worked in Hindi films, fascination for southern music started when Bhatt studied audio engineering here. \"Since I studied in the south, I always had the urge to work there. Even though I worked in 'Thoofan', the Telugu dubbed version of 'Zanjeer', I couldn't create music that'd suit the local sensibility because the songs were composed keeping Hindi audiences in mind,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:33:45.288+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
