It's not a companion to 'Depression Cherry' or a surprise or b-sides.\"\nBeach House is led by French-born vocalist and keyboardist Victoria Legrand, whose powerfully expressive, New Wave-like vocals have drawn comparison to The Cure's Robert Smith, with the music's airy texture built by guitarist Alex Scally.\nArts & Entertainment Media Beach House", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:51:35.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
