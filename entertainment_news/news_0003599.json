His products may be the ones on which you're reading this review right now. In the film's eyes, that fact exonerates him from the other, messier stuff. \nThe last 10 minutes of the movie are bad in a cushy, sentimental way that may help \"Steve Jobs\" find a wide popular audience in addition to its inevitable Oscar nominations. Much of what precedes the third act percolates nicely, with one good actor after another, starting with Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet, happily chewing away on the granola bars of Sorkin's dialogue. It takes a while to notice what's not there, and to suss out the peculiar mixture of finger-pointing and genuflection in the film's attitude toward Jobs himself. \nAct 1, shot on high-grain 16 millimeter film by cinematographer Alwin Kuchler, takes place in 1984. Jobs is about to launch the Macintosh personal computer at a Cupertino, Calif., community college. His surly ex-girlfriend Chrisann Brennan (Katherine Waterston, misdirected into a perpetual rage) and her 5-year-old daughter (Makenzie Moss), whose paternity Jobs denies, find themselves a few steps from welfare. \nBrennan has come at this dramatically opportune time to ask for a bump in child support. Meanwhile Macintosh marketing wizard Joanna Hoffman (Winslet), Jobs' de facto stage manager and resident truth-teller, hovers with a clipboard and a knack for undoing the damage done by Jobs' every human interaction. She loves the man for his genius. Sorkin's script, loosely based on Walter Isaacson's biography, has no interest in completism; it telescopes and compresses and leaves things out, such as the cancer that ultimately claimed his life. \nAct 2, shot on gleaming 35mm, 1988: Jobs has been summarily bounced from Apple. Backstage at the San Francisco Opera House, he's readying the launch of an ill-fated, overpriced but strategically shrewd computer called the NeXT Cube, from his new company. Apple will need the operating system; Jobs knows the Cube won't sell, but it's his leverage with the people who didn't believe in him sufficiently, among them Apple CEO John Sculley (Jeff Daniels). As in the first section of \"Steve Jobs,\" Jobs friend and colleague Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen, excellent in a one-and-a-half-note role) comes around to press for recognition of the Apple II team, something Jobs resists. Jobs' daughter, now 9 and played by Ripley Sobo, is an eerily eloquent sprite, dying for affection and some attention from her dad.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:05:42.997+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
