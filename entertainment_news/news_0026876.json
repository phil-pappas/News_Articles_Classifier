The 31-year-old American reality star will sit down with her best friend Malika Haqq and Gamble in the upcoming episode of 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians' and asking him questions like Have You Ever Been to Jail? For which he replied \"No, I ain't Mr. Perfect , but no trouble that's a disrespect or a threat to another person,\" Us Magazine reported. After this Haqq asked \"You and I are basically the same age, have you always been attracted to older women?\" and the guy replied that age doesn't matter connection matters. Interestingly, Kardashian seemed satisfied with his answer and the way Gamble blushed while talking about Jenner.
