Photo / iStock Asylum seekers at the Nauru detention centre will now be able to come and go as they please. The Nauru Government has confirmed the facility has become an open centre, in line with the recommendation of a recent Senate inquiry report into allegations of sexual and child abuse. Nauru's Justice Minister David Adeang said 600 asylum seekers' outstanding refugee claims would be processed within the next week. Adeang flagged that more Australian police assistance would be forthcoming. The Nauru Government has increased the number of community officers from 135 to 320, including 30 refugees, to help with the transition. Extra lifeguards will be appointed to patrol beaches to ensure the water safety of refugee families, some of whom may not have strong swimming skills. A Pakistani refugee drowned last year while swimming at the beach, along with a Nauru citizen who attempted the rescue. The Nauru Government is also in talks with Australia about ongoing health care and overseas medical referrals for refugees.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T06:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:38:40.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
