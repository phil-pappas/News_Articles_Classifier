She then proceeded to throw her daughter under the bus when Tamra mentioned that Breanna said Brooks never actually had pancreatic cancer, calling her a pot stirrer. \nMore from The Stir : Vicki Gunvalson's 'Detox' Retreat Seems Like an Escape From Her RHOC Drama \nHer story continues to be so convoluted and crazy pants that it's impossible to take anything she says seriously.
