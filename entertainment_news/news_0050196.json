From huge, painted canvases on the back of trucks and caravans, to handpainted posters, to the digital prints of today, if there has been one thing constant in cinema the world over, it has been posters. But of course, technology evolved, and with it, so did the finesse of the movie posters. Take for instance, the recent Kabali poster — it was perhaps the most-awaited poster of the year, barring Kamal's Thoonga Vanam, and Ajith's, in what's now been titled, Vedalam, which is yet to come.\nBut the thing common to movie posters in the recent past, including two of the above, is that they are all concept-based. As Vinci Raj, the Kabali poster designer, says, \"We've worked on ten posters for the film and all of them are concept-based. The photography is by Malaysian photographer Steve Koh. With Ranjith (Kabali director), I get the freedom develop the poster the way I want to. For this movie, he wanted mass appeal. All the posters will be released soon,\" says the designer who comes from an advertising background. He has also made the first-look poster of movies like Mundasupatti, Soodhu Kavvum and Thegidi. \"I went with the fingerprint for Thegidi because it is a detective film. On the other hand, Mundasupatti was a comedy, so I went with caricatures for it. The director generally narrates the story and then I decide how to design the poster. There is no set pattern or a personal style I follow,\" says Raj.\nTuney John, who has designed the posters for movies like Madras, Neram, Premam and Pizza, says posters are the packaging of the movies. \"You pick up products in a supermarket based on how it is packaged. A lot of people decide which film to go for, based on the posters. And these days, the first -look of a poster is very important. It is a much-hyped concept, but it is prevalent,\" he says. Also, says Kumar, who has been in the cine poster designing industry for the past 30-years, and made Thoonga Vanam posters, \"Designing a poster has become easy these days. We have the technology and the capacity to do whatever we want to. But the only issue is, people don't give enough time for poster making. They want it immediately. I have been working with Kamal Haasan for a very long time and he generally provides the elements early on, and he is also quite clear as to what he wants. Working on the posters then becomes easy. Even for Thoonga Vanam, he gave me the pictures and we designed the poster.\"\nBut none undermines the importance of poster in a movie's market value. Vinci believes that there are two things that attract the audience to go watch a film — its music and the first-look poster. \"If the music is a hit, people will to go to the theatre to watch the film. And, if the posters manage to raise the audience's curiosity, they get curious about the movie, too,\" he says. Tuney agrees, and says he prefers working on intricately designed posters because they add the suspense element. \"The essence of a poster is its suspense factor. How you attract the audience and at the same time, not reveal the story is the challenge. You have movies like Maan Karate and Anjaan, the posters for which are just plain stylish. And then you have posters like Villa with intricacy and complexity to it,\" he says.\nAs for the evolution of poster-making technology into a fine art, Vinci says, \"Everything is digitalised these days. The poster ideas have always been brilliant, what has changed is that today, we have the technology to back brilliant ideas. In fact, we have the tools to erase and redo posters, which was unimaginable back then.\" Tuney sees this from another perspective, \"Craftsmanship is getting refined and is constantly changing. These days, posters are designed on a trial-and-error basis. Executing a poster is not difficult, it is the idea that takes time. For example, I made the poster for Vadacurry in half-an-hour, whereas, the poster of Premam took me 11 months. I knew about the film right from the initial stages of the script. We came up with the butterfly concept based on the three stages of his life. And the end narration was specially added in the movie after the poster was made. Similarly, Neram was a challenging movie because there were too many characters and I had to include all of them.\" Tuney, who is currently working on posters for Iraivi, Urumeen and Darling 2, also rues the fact that \"There is no space these days. Even if a poster is stuck on the walls, it is either torn or something else is pasted on top of it within a few hours. Online promotion is the way forward. We are working on motion posters and augmented reality posters for a few upcoming films. Interactive posters will also be in demand in future,\" he concludes.\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-09-26T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:39:38.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
