You can't ignore what happened to Amy, that would be stupid, but there was so much more that happened to Amy than that.\" \nMitch condemned the release of 'Amy' about the Grammy Award winning singer on its release earlier this year suggesting it sensationalised her life and portrayed her family in a deceptive light, but insisted his own project won't be a \"revenge attack\". \nHe continued: \"We've got a couple of projects in the pipeline that we've been working on but it wouldn't be a revenge attack on Asif's film, we wouldn't do that. It's going to be concentrating on Amy's positivity and creativity which now has been largely ignored. So that's what we want to do.\" \nHowever, Mitch confessed he expects 'Amy' to win awards, despite the fact he sees it as untruthful. \nHe added: \"It'll win an Oscar, and it'll probably win a BAFTA, and it'll probably win everything and good luck to them. If they're happy to accept it on that basis, it's up to them.\" amy winehouse", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T23:04:36.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
