Celebrating its sixth year, the event will take place over six days, beginning Tuesday, Oct. 13. For the first time, events for all six days will be in one location: A 15,000-square-foot tent on Main Street in downtown Rochester, fashioned with a 96-foot runway, and retail and food vending areas. ROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nFashion Week heads downtown\nFor fashionistas, Tuesday’s kickoff can’t come soon enough. For others, Tuesday is just, well … Tuesday. As with most Fashion Weeks around the world, people tend to fall into two camps: the enthusiasts and the refrainers. If you happen to fall into the latter, just know, I am hoping to convert you. Here are five reasons why you should care about Fashion Week of Rochester:\nIt pays it forward\nFashion Week of Rochester helps make an enormous difference in the lives of young people in our area by bringing awareness to and supporting The Center for Youth ’s homeless programs. It marries art, design and talent to important causes and campaigns. Last year alone, our city’s Fashion Week raised more than $250,000 for The Center of Youth, helping it launch a new independent residential facility for those who are completing school and beginning their career.\nIt celebrates diversity\nBuy Photo Designer Meghan Mundy likes the look as model Kaydian Hayle of Rochester tries on outfits in preparation for Fashion Week 2015. (Photo: SHAWN DOWD/@sdowdphoto/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER)\nIf the term “fashion week” conjures up an image of size-zero models donning extravagant fashions that you could never, or would never wear, I bring great news: Fashion Week of Rochester is different. It features people of all sizes, shapes, colors and ages wearing an extensive range of fashions from casual and chic to vintage and avant-garde.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nEbony Fair re-created at Fashion Week\nOn Thursday night, a runway show will be re-creating Ebony Fashion Fair and applauding trailblazer Eunice Walker Johnson who founded the original Ebony Fair in the 1950s. “African-Americans weren’t given many opportunities to be on the runway before Ebony Fair. It seems to me, if Johnson hadn’t started it, a lot of us African-Americans may not have the opportunities we have today to be in different fashion shows and be the models we aspire to be,” shared Kaydian Hayle, 33, of Rochester, who is modeling in Thursday night’s show. “We have to applaud both her and Rochester’s Fashion Week for giving a mixed show. People will see all body types, ages and color and that is wonderful because everyone is different. This event shows real people and real clothes on the runway.”\nIt supports local businesses\nA wide variety of local businesses take part in Fashion Week of Rochester, supporting entrepreneurs in our areas and fueling the local economy. Some of these businesses include Chic Feet, Effortlessly Healthy food truck, Panache, Peppermint and more. You can get up close and personal with these businesses during Tuesday’s Fashion Exchange event, happening from 3 to 8 p.m. Bring up to two pieces of new or gently used clothing, shoes or accessories and exchange them for another piece of inventory donated by local boutiques.\nBuy Photo Models walk down the runway for the first night of 2014 Fashion Week. The event typically features fashions of all types from local designers and boutiques. (Photo: LAUREN PETRACCA/@LaurenPetracca/Staff file photo 2014)\nI t offers a flexible program schedule\nWith six days of events, there is something for everyone’s schedule. If you want to take in a lunchtime runway show, consider Wednesday's Fashion 9 to 5, featuring great business wear, daytime dresses and classic day-to-night looks. For a family friendly runway show, check out We Are Family at 7:30 p.m. Friday, featuring families, twins, brothers and sisters, silver foxes and more. Don’t miss Democrat and Chronicle ’s Mary Chao and her daughter, Noelle Nafus, who will be modeling at Friday night’s show.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nWhat to wear to Fashion Week\nThere will be puppies … enough said.\nBack by popular demand, Wednesday night's Puppy Love event will no doubt be one of the cutest runway shows you will ever see. Models and dogs dressed in their finest will strut their stuff down the runway. If fashion isn’t really your thing, but adorable animals are, this show provides the perfect way to experience fashion week and give back to the community through the purchase of a ticket.\nBuy Photo The popular doggie fashion show returns again this year.

The Fashion Exchange on Tuesday is free.\nLearn more about this year’s Fashion Week at FashionWeekofRochester.org and follow our coverage at DemocratandChronicle.com .", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7bf6bb787c86941d28ccdc75581e990e869bfa60/c=339-139-3104-2904/local/-/media/2015/09/16/Rochester/Rochester/635780055361310370-dancers-fashion-inside-web.jpg", "http://www.fashionweekofrochester.org/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/Rochester/None/2014/10/15/635490032235630006-LP-fashion-week-K-101514-Metro.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/Rochester/None/2014/10/15/635490032235630006-LP-fashion-week-K-101514-Metro.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/46f78a37b3053d1d8e29ef7cecfc51511ff13603/r=500x353/local/-/media/2015/10/08/Rochester/Rochester/635798856995614418-SD-100215-FASHION-D-FEAT.jpg", "http://centerforyouth.net/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f93837db5ce2151c0b4ce688136a89f1e99b8040/c=114-0-1887-1333&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/Rochester/None/2014/10/15/635490032235630006-LP-fashion-week-K-101514-Metro.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9f90c365dee9b69723e50ef81e40cfbab9563d5a/c=0-0-3816-2869&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/08/Rochester/Rochester/635798856995614418-SD-100215-FASHION-D-FEAT.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/Rochester/None/2014/10/15/635490032444130006-LP-fashion-week-L-101514-Metro.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3b6098005d9374ae6c347b4c562b2c698021208c/r=300/local/-/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/246e2b120e2d72b12b3b9205df4f617818e52cd0/c=113-0-1887-1334&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/Rochester/None/2014/10/15/635490032444130006-LP-fashion-week-L-101514-Metro.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/08/Rochester/Rochester/635798856995614418-SD-100215-FASHION-D-FEAT.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/Rochester/None/2014/10/15/635490032444130006-LP-fashion-week-L-101514-Metro.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/48cd075f18b6fddae8de1e2eafab5a30b5843e8c/c=990-0-4446-3456/local/-/media/2015/10/08/Rochester/Rochester/635799038012732113-SD-100215-MARY-B-FEAT.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-13T01:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:15:30.162+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
