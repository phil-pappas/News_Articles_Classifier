The award-winning bilingual literacy campaign for families, sponsored by Infinity Auto Insurance, celebrates this milestone with the launch of the #SoyBilingüePorque challenge.\nMiami, FL (PRWEB) October 01, 2015\nRead Conmigo celebrates its millionth book distributed across the United States. The award-winning bilingual literacy campaign for families, sponsored by Infinity Auto Insurance, celebrates this milestone with the launch of the #SoyBilingüePorque challenge. Read Conmigo is a free program that supports bilingual literacy by providing parents with free books and resources to encourage them to read to their children at home.\n“There was a gap between the education children received in school and application in the home. Many Hispanic parents who do not speak or read English fluently were hesitant to read with their children in English or Spanish. So we created Read Conmigo to help solve this problem. Since the campaign began in 2011, we have received an outpouring of positive support and feedback,” said James R. Gober, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Infinity Property and Casualty Corporation, the parent company of Infinity Auto Insurance. “With the millionth book, we wanted to celebrate by launching the #SoyBilingüePorque challenge and thank the community for supporting us.”\nHispanic Heritage Month celebrates the importance of more than 54 million Hispanics in the United States, and Read Conmigo recognizes the contributions they have made and continue to make to grow our communities.\nThe celebration of the millionth book during Hispanic Heritage Month kicks off the #SoyBilingüePorque challenge which encourages Hispanics to demonstrate how proud they are to be bicultural and bilingual. Participants are encouraged to post a photo of the #SoyBilingüePorque sign explaining why they are proud to speak more than one language on Instagram, Twitter or Facebook. They are asked to challenge two friends to post their own #SoyBilingüePorque photo and so on. The challenge lasts from September 15 to October 15, in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month.\nAbout the Read Conmigo Bilingual Literacy Campaign: Infinity Auto Insurance is driven to serve others. Read Conmigo represents one of Infinity’s largest investments in the community. Recognized as a Bright Spot in Hispanic Education by the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanics, Read Conmigo provides parents with bilingual storybooks, apps, and online resources to read with their children in English or Spanish. The program has already distributed more than one million free books to classrooms and Hispanic families, and receives support from more than 9,200 educators. The campaign also creates opportunities for new Hispanic authors and illustrators.
