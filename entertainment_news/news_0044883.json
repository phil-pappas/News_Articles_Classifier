What is it? Reality TV show Gogglebox has proved an oddly-compelling hit in the UK, and now Australia is about to air its own version.\nPT1M57S http://www.smh.com.au/action/externalEmbeddedPlayer?id=d-3pf2a 620 349 February 3, 2015 Autoplay On Off Video feedback Video settings If you want a great Aussie underdog story, check out Gogglebox Australia (Ten, 8.40pm). They said it'd never make it. They said nobody would want to watch a TV show that was just about other people watching other TV shows.\nThey said reality TV had finally eaten itself, and the public would refuse to consume what it had vomited up. They said \"Googlebox?\" because they had not read the title carefully.\nThey said the British version on which the show was based was a massive hit — but that doesn't sit very well with the whole \"underdog story\" thing, so let's ignore that.\nGogglebox represents a broadening of the horizons of television.\nFor, despite all the naysayers, Gogglebox has bounced into a second series, which proves that no matter how weird or stupid a concept looks at first glance, if it's very cheap to make Channel Ten will probably give it a shot.\nAdvertisement But Gogglebox is more than just an inexpensive way for a TV network to fill its local content quota and for we viewers at home to make judgmental comments about the home furnishings of strangers: the strange appeal of this most meta of reality shows says something very profound about modern culture. Or possibly it says something about modern culture's inability to say something very profound.\nThe obvious conclusion you might take from a quick glance at Gogglebox is that people have become so jaded by the tyranny of choice on offer in today's entertainment marketplace that watching other people being entertained is the only thing left for us to be interested in — like watching YouTube videos of the reactions of others to YouTube videos.\nFunny and fascinating: The Late Show with Stephen Colbert .\nHowever, while those who take this view will see the Gogglebox phenomenon as a sign of an encroaching event horizon of creative bankruptcy ready to swallow us all, I feel the more accurate view is that the show represents a broadening of the horizons of television.\nHere we have home-made TV criticism and pop-culture commentary, delivered off the cuff and with a minimum of artifice, relatable characters riffing on familiar subjects — elements that are easy to accept as ingredients for fine television, once we relinquish the prejudice that says \"watching the watchers\" is just too self-reflexive to bear. At the very least we can abandon the snobbery that sees no value in TV itself, and therefore no value in examining the action of watching it.\nBesides which, and there's no other argument necessary, it's fun.\nFurther viewing: Grimm (Seven, 11.10pm) investigates a murder victim asphyxiated by clay — some terrifying fairytale potter no doubt responsible.\nThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert (Eleven, 10.55pm) is both funny and fascinating as one of TV's most original seeks to fit himself to a most traditional format.\nRegular Show (GO! 6pm) is a kids' show, which is why you don't watch it, which is your loss because it's genius.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:49:33.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
