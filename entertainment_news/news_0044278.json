Photo: Keith Lo Bue \nMichael Buzacott​: Sculpture . ANU Drill Hall Gallery, Kingsley Street, Acton. Until November 1. \nIn an interview recorded about a decade ago, the Sydney-based sculptor, Michael Buzacott, explained his method of work:\n\"So there is a pile [of materials] on the floor and you are standing around for hours in complete darkness, then after four or five hours of becoming more and more frustrated you get rid of all your conscious thinking because it is holding you back, and as soon as you do, you start making connections; something happens that will be completely instinctual.\"  \n\"Large Goldfish\" ( 2015) by Martin Buzacott in \"Sculpture\" at ANU Drill Hall Gallery. Photo: Stephen Oxenbury \nBuzacott believes in an intuitive process of art-making, one which is essentially haptic and determined by the hand and through feeling, rather than being guided by the conscious intellect, and one where the final outcome is as much a surprise to the artist as it is to anyone else. Although mercifully, at least since he matured as a sculptor, he has not followed the lead of High Modernism and simply called all of his pieces \"untitled\", his titles appear after the making of a piece of sculpture. They are not illustrations of literary concepts or based on working drawings.  \nAdvertisement Steel pieces such as Large Goldfish (2015), or Susanna bathing (2012) may refer to a general aquatic theme which runs throughout much of his oeuvre, reflecting his Sydney neighbourhood, but the strange little whimsical shapes were brought together without an illustrative purpose in mind. Once the work is completed, or abandoned in the sense that it has been taken as far as he is able to do, then the figurative content of the composition reveals itself. The title for the viewer becomes an entry point in the process of interpreting the piece.\nIn some of the sculptures, including Mira's Somersault (2010) or the superb Little Fall of Icarus  (2010-14), the figurative content is more obvious and in the face of the viewer and, if one subscribes to this artist's philosophy, then it is likely that the unconscious intellect has played a more active role. It was about 500 years ago that Michelangelo in his sonnets espoused the idea that an artist builds up a skill base and then lets go and surrenders to the creative process, so that \"work the practised chisel brings/ And into life a form so graceful springs/ That none can fear for it time's rudest shock\".  \n\"Mira's Somersault\" (2010) by Martin Buzacott in \"Sculpture\" at ANU Drill Hall Gallery. Photo: Keith Lo Bue \nLeaving aside the artist's rhetoric, Buzacott works in the tradition of welded constructivist sculpture, associated with Julio Gonzalez​ and to some extent Pablo Picasso, working within the general orbit of Cubism. Caro was an early god, when he studied at the National Art School in Sydney, and some of the juvenile pieces included in this survey exhibition, which were made when he was in his 20s, strongly reflect this formalist heritage. In his process of work, he appears occasionally to cannibalise his own sculptures and these serve as raw materials for subsequent creations, so that the recycled elements guarantee a consistency and a strong sense of continuity. Huge composite pieces, such as Sydney summer, 2012, seem to be an encrustation of materials accumulated in the studio over a considerable period of time. \nBuzacott has been exhibiting since the mid-1970s and this is a timely survey of his development to date. There have been few abrupt changes in direction throughout his art, although, in retrospect, the formalist austerity of pieces such as Splendid sunset  (1981) appear as a bit of an aberration. His work with time has become increasing whimsical, with a stronger narrative dimension, and there is frequently a generous dose of humour. Some of the pieces, such as a number of the \"portraits\", are somewhat predictable, even a spot trite. If there is a criticism, then it is that more recently in his work charm and predictability have grown at the expense of sculpture's ability to challenge, surprise and enchant the beholder.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:21:25.327+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
