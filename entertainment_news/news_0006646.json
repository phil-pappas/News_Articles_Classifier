No problem! You can still watch the Michigan-Michigan State game Saturday surrounded by hordes of football crazies fueled by beer, burgers and school spirit. Just grab a table at your favorite sports bar and you, too, can be a participant in this year’s epic showdown between the Green and White and the Maize and Blue.\nVirtually every bar will have the game on TV. But if you want to surround yourself with a crowd, here are nine favorite viewing places in metro Detroit, Ann Arbor and East Lansing where you’ll find multiple screens, good drinks and ample eats.\nRound up your friends and a designated driver and — whether you go Blue or bleed Green — get there early!\nMETRO DETROIT Rosie O’Grady’s, Ferndale: With a whopping 102 screens and happy hour specials throughout the game, this big, handsome restaurant and bar on West 9 Mile in Ferndale will be packed, “easily double an ordinary Saturday,” says general manager Tim Martin. He’s hoping for good patio weather, when Rosie’s can seat 550-600, compared to 400-450 inside only. Martin is a Michigan fan, but the bar benefits when the Spartans win, he says. “We’re a Michigan State bar, by far. If they win, people will hang around and celebrate. If they lose, they’ll be upset and head home.” Rosie’s is running $2 domestic pints for the game, Martin says, so it’ll be a huge beer day either way. (279 W. Nine Mile. Other locations in Chesterfield and Southgate. www.rosieogradysirishpub.com )\nBookies Bar & Grille, Detroit: On game days, you’ll find this attractive spot on lower Cass Avenue packed with people wearing maize and blue. “We normally get a lot of Michigan fans,” says bartender Joe Shields. There are so many, in fact, the bar offers “U of M specials” on food, beers and cocktails — try the Go Bluetini — when games are on. The first floor has the best viewing, with six big flat screens and a giant projector, but lots of fans head for the rooftop — which is half open-air — with three TVs. There’s a better-than-average menu, 15 taps, lots of bottled beers, and a huge liquor selection, Shields says, not to mention lots of parking on nearby open lots. You might get lucky and find them unattended, in which case they’re free, he says.

(Photo: Kimberly P. Mitchell, Detroit Free Press)\nBuffalo Wild Wings, Detroit: Every Buffalo Wild Wings has a ton of TVs, but this one at the edge of Greektown, with at least 95 screens, comes with a distinction: It was the largest B-Dubs in America when it opened in late 2012. Since then, they’ve upgraded their TVs and added projectors, so the smallest flat screen is a 60-incher and the projector screens are around 128 inches, says manager Julian Moorer. The U-M-MSU game is one of the busiest days of the year, he says, but with room for 400 guests on two floors, you shouldn’t have any trouble finding a seat with an unobstructed view of the game. Oh, and they sell wings, too. (1218 Randolph, about 2½ blocks from Campus Martius; www.buffalowildwings.com )\nANN ARBOR Scorekeepers Sports Bar and Grill: Jammed with undergrads and sometimes with a line out the door, the 375-seat \"Skeeps\" has been called the quintessential college bar. With three giant projectors stretching all the way across the bar and 26 big-screen TVs, you shouldn't have any trouble seeing those touchdowns. Opening early, at 10 a.m., on game day to serve a breakfast buffet for the throngs on the streets. (310 Maynard, near East Liberty and East William; www.facebook.com/scorekeepers.arbor )\nBrown Jug Restaurant: You can't get much more traditional in Ann Arbor than The Brown Jug, opened in 1938 and named for the oldest trophy in college sports. Lots of memorabilia, a long history, a huge drinks menu and the kind of pub-style food you know to expect in an old-time college bar. The 168-seat dining room and bar offers 13 TVs. Opening early, at 10 a.m., Saturday. (1204 S. University near Church in the heart of the campus; www.brownjug-annarbor.com )\nThe HopCat Ann Arbor bar and restaurant. (Photo: BarFly Ventures)\nHopCat: With 100 beers on tap and those signature Crack Fries on its huge menu, Ann Arbor’s HopCat will be hopping on Saturday. “The earlier you get here, the better, especially if you’re looking for a spot to watch the game,” says host Lucy Weaver. It’s a good spot for TV viewing, with six big-screens at the bar and five more scattered around the 296-seat restaurant, she says. They’ll open early, at 9 a.m., with their regular menu and all hands on deck. Open since February, this handsome new place is just 1 mile from the Big House.

(Photo: Matthew Dae Smith, Lansing State Journal)\nThe FieldHouse: The former Peppino’s Pizzeria, part of a Grand Rapids chain, became an independent called the FieldHouse Sports Bar just last month. This huge place can seat up to 530 guests in all and has “a ton of TVs. Our walls are completely filled with them,” says bartender Julia Hollett. On Saturday, “It’ll be crazy and filed with fans” enjoying lots of pizza and beer, but it's also family-friendly, she adds. Look for food, drink and shot specials all day.

(Photo: Robert Killips, Lansing State Journal)\nCrunchy's: Billing itself as East Lansing's original craft beer bar, Crunchy's and its half-pound Crunchy Burger have been around since 1982. “It’s an exciting place to watch the game. We have horns and lights every time MSU scores,” says bartender and server Jay Scofield. What happens when the Wolverines score? “It gets very quiet,” he says. Crunchy’s seats about 104, but expect a standing-room-only crowd this Saturday. (254 E. Grand River; www.crunchyseastlansing.com )\nSpartan alum David James of Detroit, foreground, came to the Peanut Barrel last April to watch MSU play Duke in the Final Four semifinals. (Photo: Matthew Dae Smith)\nPeanut Barrel: They don’t throw peanut shells on the floor anymore, and the nuts are served only on request now. But otherwise, the 41-year-old Peanut Barrel is still a lot like the place you might remember as an MSU student. Known for its strong Long Island Iced Teas and signature green-olive burgers, the bar seats just 94 — cozy by today’s mega-bar standards — but every seat has good views of a TV, says general manager Meghan Bell, who’s looking forward to Saturday’s game. “I’m anticipating a very happy crowd and a Spartan win,” she says.
