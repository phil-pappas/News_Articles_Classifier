The stand-up comedian took to Twitter on Monday, October 12 to make it clear that she didn't mean any harm to Khloe and her family with her comment on \" Saturday Night Live \". The \" Trainwreck \" actress posted a photo of an adorable girl who tried to lift up her oversized shorts. Though Amy didn't mention the Kardashian family, the caption for the photo was seemingly meant for them. \"Nothing but love for that family. I like idea of sending women the message to be happy in their own skin. #peace,\" she wrote. During her monologue on \"SNL\", Amy called the Kardashians \"a whole family of women that take the faces they were born with as a light suggestion.\" The \" Inside Amy Schumer \" star also addressed Khloe's weight loss as saying, \"We used to have Khloe. Khloe was ours, right? Whenever there's a group of women, you identify with one of them, right? Khloe, she lost half her body weight. She lost a Kendall [Jenner], and we have nothing.\" Following Amy's comment, Khloe took to Twitter to write a cryptic message. The 31-year-old reality TV star didn't mention Amy on her tweet but it seemingly referred to the comedian's monologue. She wrote, \"No need 2 tear down others just 2 make urself feel bigger.
