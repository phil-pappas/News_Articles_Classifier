Gonna need you tonight...\" she wrote before her show in Buenos Aires, Argentina on Sunday. \nIn the following days, she documented her struggle and revealed she had holed up in her hotel room watching movies on streaming service Netflix. \n\"Netflix and chills Netflix and fever Netflix and sweat (sic),\" she wrote in a post on Instagram.com. \"Netflix and snot Netflix and strange smells Netflix and cough till you're a donkey Netflix and burning eyeballs Netflix and hot pees Netflix and green slime (sic)...\" \nShe also added a picture of alphabet soup spelling out the word 'sick'. \nThe long-running tour kicked off in Belfast, Northern Ireland in May, 2014 and Katy will have played 151 shows by the time it comes to an end.
