A source says the production of the ABC musical drama series is \"adapting\" following the actress' decision to enter a treatment facility for postpartum depression. Supported by Connie Britton and Clare Bowen among others, the show is currently airing season 4. Like Panettiere, her character Juliette Barnes has also been struggling with postpartum depression since late last season. Hayden Panettiere gave birth to her first child with Wladimir Klitschko in December last year. During her visit to \" Live! with Kelly and Michael \" last month, she opened about her struggle with depression. \"She went through that, which is something that I can very much relate to, and something that I know a lot of women experience,\" she said, referring to Juliette Barnes. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:43:30.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
