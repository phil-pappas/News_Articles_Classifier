Congress prevented it, but the story is one of many examples of Márquez’s deep influence on Latin-American politics as well as the worlds of literature and journalism.\nHis intertwined roles on the world stage are described in “Gabo” through numerous interviews with friends, biographers and family, as well as archival footage of the writer. Born in a tiny town on the Caribbean coast and largely raised by grandparents, Márquez, who died in 2014, tried on different personas as a searching young man, writing his unappreciated first novel in his early 20s and taking a full two decades to find the inspiration for his magic-realism classic “One Hundred Years.”\nMovie Review ★★★★   ‘ Gabo: The Creation of Gabriel García Márquez,’ a documentary directed by Justin Webster, from a screenplay by Webster and Kate Horne. 90 minutes. Not rated. SIFF Film Center.\nAlong the way, and while he continued to cement his reputation as a literary giant, Márquez — often reluctantly — occupied other public roles.\n  A wealthy non-Communist, he nevertheless nurtured a friendship with Fidel Castro that helped free some of Cuba’s imprisoned writers. During Colombia’s era of terrorism funded by Pablo Escobar, Márquez helped keep endangered journalism alive.\nAbove all, we see his sly wit and plain-spoken charm, his unwillingness to wield his famous name as a political weapon, his intense gaze on human mysteries and his refusal to accept death as fair. \nTom Keogh: tomwkeogh@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:39:55.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
