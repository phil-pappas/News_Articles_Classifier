Leaders do the right thing, don't play games,\" Netanyahu said at the closed meeting of his Likud faction last week, in the recording broadcast on Army Radio.\nHe was referring to public remarks and visits several Likud ministers paid to a protest tent that settlers, demanding stronger security measures, erected outside Netanyahu's official residence in Jerusalem after a deadly Palestinian assault.\nIt was only one signal of possible political trouble ahead for the four-term leader trying to stem an eruption of almost daily Palestinian knife and gun attacks, which have killed eight Israelis in the past three weeks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T06:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:04:54.309+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
