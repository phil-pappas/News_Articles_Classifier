Nestlé Toll House is unveiling its 2015 seasonal baking trends to help home bakers discover creative new recipes and inventive ways to use its variety of baking products. Today’s bakers have access to endless sources of inspiration and Do-It-Yourself confidence. Demographic trends such as an increase in multicultural families and smaller households are also influencing how America bakes. With more self-taught and culinary adventurous consumers, baking has evolved to include ingredient-driven sophistication, more baking customization, and personal interpretation of classics.\n“The definition of baking now includes a variety of ingredients, flavors, and ways to bake. NESTLÉ® TOLL HOUSE® chocolate chip cookies will always be an American favorite but by infusing them with Tahini, we’re reinventing a classic recipe with a modern flavor profile,” said Lucien Vendôme, Director of Culinary Innovation at Nestlé USA. “Consumers are actively redefining traditional baking and Nestlé Toll House wants to be part of that journey by inspiring home bakers to achieve their baking aspirations.”\nA leader in baking for more than 75 years, Nestlé Toll House is participating in this shift by inspiring consumers of all skill levels with new ways to use its variety of quality baking products. This year, Nestlé Toll House partnered with esteemed pastry chefs from around the country to define key trends for the 2015 baking season.\nLed by Lucien Vendôme, these baking masterminds identified three core trends that will drive this year’s baking season–Speed Scratch, Farmers Market Inspired Baking, and Tradition Reinvented.\nSpeed Scratch\nBeautiful baking creations aren’t just for trained pastry chefs. Today’s bakers can tap into pastry chef creativity and ensure success by leveraging proven baking shortcuts. Premade dough simplifies preparation, lets bakers explore ingredient variety and minimizes inconsistencies. Craft of Baking Author, Karen DeMasco, shows how easy it is to bake to impress with her Pistachio Pinwheel Cookie recipe, using NESTLÉ® TOLL HOUSE® Refrigerated Cookie Bar Dough, ground pistachio nuts, lemon zest and a hint of honey and lemon.\nFarmers Market Inspired Baking\nModern bakers are eager to use ingredients that are in season to bring out the best flavor in their baked treats. With access to farmers markets year round, there are plenty of options for creating desserts with a distinct seasonal flavor. Award-winning pastry chef, Michael Laiskonis, inspires creativity with an Autumn-themed recipe that celebrates harvest flavors. The Autumn-Harvest Cookie Collection combines NESTLÉ® TOLL HOUSE® Harvest Apple Refrigerated Cookie Dough, NESTLÉ® TOLL HOUSE® Hot Cocoa Refrigerated Cookie Dough, NESTLÉ® TOLL HOUSE® Pumpkin Spice Morsels and fresh apples for a mouth-watering collection of fall flavors beautifully displayed in a bento box.\nTradition Reinvented\nMulticultural families are on the rise and with this demographic makeover in the U.S., home bakers are connecting with their heritage by updating treasured desserts. The memories behind classic recipes are timeless but today’s baker is looking to create new traditions. Secrets of Baking Author, Sherry Yard, gives classic sugar cookies an ethnic twist with her recipe for Alfajores. Corn flour is kneaded into NESTLÉ® TOLL HOUSE® Refrigerated Sugar Cookie Dough, then the baked cookies are sandwiched with dulce de leche filling and flavored with hints of spice and honey for a Latin-inspired flair.\nAs temperatures drop around the country, Nestlé Toll House is inviting consumers to warm up their ovens and share their baking best this holiday season. Together, with the following leading pastry chefs, Nestlé Toll House developed easy must-bake recipes based on the latest baking trends.\nEsteemed New York Pastry Chef, Richard Capizzi Craft of Baking Author, Karen DeMasco TV Personality and Sugar Rush Author, Johnny Iuzzini Sofra Bakery Owner, Maura Kilpatrick Institute of Culinary Education Creative Director, Michael Laiskonis La Boîte Owner and Master Spice Blender, Lior Lev Sercarz Vice President of Culinary Direction at iPic Entertainment and Owner of Helms Bakery, Sherry Yard\nThese new recipes, along with ideas for creating unique desserts using Nestlé Toll House products, are available for media and consumers at http://www.tollhousebakingtrends.com .\nAbout Nestlé USA\nNamed one of “The World’s Most Admired Food Companies” in Fortune magazine for eighteen consecutive years, Nestlé provides quality brands that bring flavor to life every day.
