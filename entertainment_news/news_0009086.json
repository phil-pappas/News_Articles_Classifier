Excerpts...\nYear after year, you've kept Prithvi Theatre going strong, despite it being a loss-making venture... why?\nYou want to know why I keep this place alive? That's because secretly, I must be a masochist! I like the pain (laughs). On a serious note, I think it is the need of the hour. It is hard to keep this place going the way we want it to. But it has been 37 years and yet, there is no other theatre like Prithvi today in the city. Remember, unlike elsewhere, in our theatre we only stage plays — no corporate dos, sangeets or anything else. Last year alone, we had 635 shows. Unfortunately, Mumbai needs many more Prithvis. Any civilisation that has done well in history has had a background of highly developed arts and sciences. Yet, we don't have any government policy that supports arts. People are putting more effort in protecting cows, instead of preserving the performing arts and I find that very distressing! We haven't kept Prithvi running because of people's expectations alone... it's running because that's what it's meant to do. The aim of theatre is to encourage professional theatre, create a cultural hub and generate an audience that is excited to watch plays. That's what we are doing and we're doing it pretty well. My mother (Jennifer Kapoor) would have been very proud of where Prithvi has reached today.\nWhat's different in the festival this time around?\nIt's another edition of the festival and that's what is new. It's like asking me what's special about my two children. This time, except for one play, all the others are premiering. We often complain that we don't have enough playwrights and so are constantly doing adaptations. But if you look at our line-up this year, you'll see we have all Indian writers and subjects. The opening play Kaumudi, which is from Bangalore, has been inspired from our heritage, values and culture. It's going to be 10 days of exciting theatre, music, dance and even circus performances. It's an interesting mix of old and new groups. While we have a maverick like Makarand Deshpande, we also have new actors like Kunal Kapoor. Then the Symphony Orchestra of India (SOI) will perform a concerto composed by Vanraj Bhatia, who gave music for my father's films like Junoon, Kalyug and 36 Chowringhee Lane . He has been close to my parents and so, on a personal level, this performance is special to me.\nIt must be tough to bring together the entire theatre fraternity for the fest...\nWe support the fraternity the whole year around. It's not like we force them to participate. They enjoy being part of the festival. Luckily, there is a big loyalty towards Prithvi. In fact, I get a lot of complaints where people ask me, 'Why are we not part of the festival?' I mean, I can't have a festival that goes on for six months! When we choose a play, we take many factors into account — whether the story is good, the group's background etc. It's a very tough call to make.\nFor latest Bollywood updates follow us on Twitter >>> @TOIEntertain\nFor the latest in Bollywood news, like us on Facebook >>> TOIEntertain\nThere are other drama festivals also happening in the city at the same time. Are you threatened by competition?\nThere are many festivals but the edge that Prithvi has over others is the place itself and its ambience. No other theatre has the kind of atmosphere and unique flavour that we have developed over the years. One of the special things about Prithvi is the sanctity of the place. You don't feel like you're walking into a mall, with products being thrust down your throat! For us, it's not about competition. It's all about promoting theatre. We don't want to be an island; we want to be the ocean. If I have any complaints with other theatres, it's that they don't have enough shows.\nAre the Kapoor kids actively participating like last time to take this legacy forward?\nMy daughter Shaira isn't here, as she's studying in England, where she is doing a course on stage and cinema design. My son Zahan is involved and is shooting promos for the plays. No one else from the Kapoors is participating as such. It has always been us... this has been dad's baby all along.\nWATCH: Shashi Kapoor's son returns to the screen after 30 years - TOI\nBiradri (B/W) Amazon.in : INR 99.00 Buy now Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41il0ToJNTL._SL160_.jpg", "https://twitter.com/TOIEntertain", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/0tCes2QcfB0", "http://www.amazon.in/Biradri-B-W-Shashi-Kapoor/dp/B006QSTZGU%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJP4GPDYQHXPFUOWQ%26tag%3Dtimofind-21%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB006QSTZGU"], "published": "2015-10-24T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T19:49:21.765+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
