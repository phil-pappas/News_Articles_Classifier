Khloe, along with mom Kris Jenner and sisters Kim and Kourtney Kardashian and Kendall and Kylie Jenner, dropped their responsibilities to fly out to Sin City to be by Lamar's bedside.\nOn Thursday, the Kardashian-Jenner family released a statement saying they will not be updating their popular mobile apps with new content in light of Lamar's condition. \"As a family, we've decided to hold off on publishing content across our apps while we continue to support and pray for Lamar,\" they said. \"Thank you for your kindness and understanding during this difficult time.\"\nKourtney is the only sister without her own app, but youngest sibling Kylie was in the middle of a live chat with fans when she received news of Lamar's hospitalization on Tuesday. Meanwhile, all of the siblings and Kris were spotted flying out of Las Vegas via private jet on Thursday, while Khloe stayed behind at the hospital.\nAccording to Entertainment Tonight, hospital bosses have ramped up security around the property, with guards and police officers constantly patrolling the area. Khloe filed for divorce from Odom in 2013 after four years of marriage, and although both signed papers to end their union in July, their case has not been finalized by a judge and they remain legally wed.\nWENN Newsdesk 0 comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:33:35.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
