The change will be effective in November, and Larsson will report to Lauren who will continue to drive the company’s vision and strategy as executive chairman and chief creative officer.\nGALLERY: New York Fashion Week’s hottest trends\nHOT PICS: Celebs in the front row at NYFW\nAs global president of Old Navy for three years, Larsson remade the business into a bright spot in Gap’s portfolio. Prior to his tenure at Old Navy, Larsson was part of an executive team at Swedish cheap chic fashion chain H&M for 15 years that increased annual revenue to $17 billion from $3 billion. During that time, H&M’s operations grew to 44 countries from 12.\nNew head ...

Lauren, who started the company 48-years-ago selling ties, has built a vast empire that includes women’s, men’s and children’s clothing, home decor, accessories and now restaurants. But after years of surging growth, Ralph Lauren has seen its revenue slow down.\nIn the latest fiscal year ended in March, Ralph Lauren Corp. generated sales of $7.5 billion, but that represented just a 2.3 per cent increase from the previous year. Net income slipped nearly 10 per cent in the latest fiscal year. The company has been grappling with weakness in its Europe business and the overall saturation of the luxury business.\nChange of pace ...

They also noted there’s a lot of room to grow with the three new brands.\n“What attracted me to take on this role was Ralph himself and his vision,” Larsson told The Associated Press in the interview. “So my job is to work side by side with Ralph, refine it and grow the company into the future.”\nRalph Lauren also announced that Jackwyn Nemerov, president and chief operating officer, will retire in November, at which time she will become an adviser to the company.\nLauren said that consumers are even more interested in high-quality clothing as people have a lot of clothes.\n“Luxury is an exciting area,” Lauren said. “Consumers want specialness. They want quality. There’s a lot of mediocracy out there. And that’s not selling. What’s selling is specialness, quality and uniqueness. One of a kind ... and that’s what I stand for.”\nExpanding ... Lauren and Larsson say they are looking for more growth opportunities in China and Europe as well as pushing for more growth in the e-commerce business.

The company also operated 558 concession shops worldwide. In addition, international licensing partners operation more than 200 other locations.\nMeanwhile, Gap Inc., based in San Francisco, said Larsson will step down Oct. 2 and Jill Stanton would lead Old Navy in the interim while it searches for a permanent replacement. Stanton is currently executive vice president of global product at Old Navy. Gap noted in a release that Stanton is a “proven industry veteran” with more than 25 years retail experience, including almost 14 years as vice president and general manager of global apparel at Nike.\nRalph Lauren’s shares slipped 83 cents to close at $104.05, but rose nearly 4 per cent, or $4.07 to $108.12 in after-hours trading when the news was announced.
