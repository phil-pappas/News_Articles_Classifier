Produced by Jillian Kitchener. â–² Hide   \nROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) STORY: Jake Shimabukuro may call the ukulele \"the underdog of instruments\" but he's turned his passion for playing into a 13-year solo career. The Honolulu-raised musician says he started playing when he was four years old and remembers becoming invested in the ukulele after his parents got divorced. \"Like when I was young my mom would sit with me and teach me some chords and we would play for an hour or two at a time... I think I would play the Ukulele a lot to kind of remind me of that time I would spend with her,\" said Shimabukuro. He says the passion has remained. Shimabukuro's mastery brought him to Virginia's Birchmere concert hall in August near the beginning of a world tour, including shows in the United Kingdom and Japan, to promote his upcoming album. \"Travels\" is set for release on October 9, 2015. He describes his music as an eclectic mix. \"I started out playing traditional Hawaiian music in Hawaii growing up there and then later I started listening to different styles of music, just pop and rock but I also love jazz and classical music. Just everything. I love acoustic instruments but I also love electric instruments,\" said Shimabukuro. This may explain why he has been called \"all kinds of stuff, like the Jimmy Hendrix of the ukulele.\" According to Shimabukuro, the new album is \"kind of a tribute to a lot of my mentors and teachers and people that have inspired me along the way.\" He says he wanted to capture the same \"tone\" as his live performances, which involve a lot of energy. \"The idea is music is just another language or another form of communication. So, so why not incorporate some of that body language into your, into the performance,\" said Shimabukuro, who admits the stage is his gym. And fans say they love to watch him jump around on stage while playing. Alexandria resident Amy Devine said she has been learning to play the ukulele and looks to Shimabukuro as inspiration. \"Having attempted to play I know it's a lot harder than it looks. But yeah, he's an incredible player, a unique talent, it was really a lot of fun to get to see him up close. It's hard to believe it's only one person playing on stage,\" Devine said. Moses Kamai, Director of the Northern Virginia Ukulele Society, says close to 50 members came out to the Birchmere concert to see Shimabukuro in action, performing some challenging chords. \"He inspires everybody. But the pieces he plays, he certainly challenges people too,\" said Kamai. Shimabukuro often meets with fans after the show and autographs ukuleles. he calls them \"the mini iPad of instruments. You can take it with you everywhere.\" And this musician is taking his ukulele \"everywhere,\" with tour dates across the United States set until February next year.  //reut.rs/1Mbr1W1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:04:10.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
