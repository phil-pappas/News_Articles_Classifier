It had previously been restricted to writers from Britain, Ireland and the Commonwealth of former British colonies.\nSome British book-lovers expressed fears of an American takeover, but last year's winner was Australia's Richard Flanagan, for \"The Narrow Road to the Deep North.\"\nTwo Americans are among this year's finalists: Pulitzer Prize winner Anne Tyler, for multigenerational family saga \"A Spool of Blue Thread,\" and Hawaiian writer Hanya Yanagihara for \"A Little Life,\" the story of four male friends, one of whom, is a survivor of horrific child abuse.\nBritish bookmakers Ladbrokes and William Hill - which offer odds on the prize as if it were a sporting event - made Yanagihara the favorite for her unsparing 700-page tale of childhood trauma and its legacy.\nThe other front-runners in betting are British writer Sunjeev Sahota's \"The Year of the Runaways,\" the highly topical story of migrants from India scrabbling to make a living in Britain, and \"A Brief History of Seven Killings\" by Marlon James, the first Jamaican Booker finalist.\nAlso on the list are British writer Tom McCarthy's \"Satin Island,\" about a digital denizen adrift on a sea of information, and \"The Fishermen,\" by Nigeria's Chigozie Obioma, in which a family is destroyed by a prophecy of fratricide.\nThe Booker guarantees a big boost in sales for the winner, and can transform writers' careers. When Hilary Mantel won for Tudor saga \"Wolf Hall\" in 2009, she went from modestly successful novelist to literary superstar.\nFounded in 1969, the award is officially named the Man Booker Prize after its sponsor, financial services firm Man Group PLC.\n___\nOnline: http://themanbookerprize.com/ \nFollow Jill Lawless on Twitter at http://Twitter.com/JillLawless \n___\nA previous version of this story misspelled Hanya Yanagihara's name in headlines.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
