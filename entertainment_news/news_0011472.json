The actor was in Kerala recently and spoke to Trivandrum Times about his hunger for challenges, friendships in Mollywood and upcoming projects. Excerpts from a chat:\nYou recently completed 25 years in the film industry. Any regrets or unfulfilled dreams?\nNone! I am happy about the way things panned out. I got to work with some great filmmakers and play some memorable characters, but feel I can do a lot more. I am excited about what the future holds for me. I couldn't have asked for anything better as far as the past 25 years are concerned.\nYou seem to have a huge fan base in Kerala...\nI love the audience here because they take Tamil movies for what it is, just as they accept the diversity of genres in other industries. They have always been sensitive towards good cinema, ideas and creativity. The best part is — they don't insist on heroism in films. The heroes can be negative characters or even losers. I think that is admirable. Tamil cinema too has been experimenting on these lines, especially the small-budget ones.\nWhy haven't we seen you in Malayalam cinema of late? Truth be told, I have not really got the right offer yet. I want my comeback film to be something like a Chemmeen - a film that the audience would remember, even decades after it's made. Money or budget wouldn't matter, if it is an exceptional project. Is there anyone in the Malayalam industry whom you would like to work with? I think Anjali Menon did phenomenal work in Bangalore Days. In fact I'd also expressed my desire to work with her recently.\nDo you have friends in Kerala?\nMy life is such that I hardly get time to spend with friends. My world revolves around my work, gym and home. I'm barely in touch even with the people in the Tamil industry. You won't see me going for parties, attending functions or award shows. That said, I have a few good friends in Kerala. I had recently met Mammukka and Dulquer briefly. Kavya Madhavan is another person I'm in touch with. We became close while working together for Kasi. She is a sweetheart. I have told her, ''Listen, you better remain my sister...' as our sibling vibes helped our performance too. When she got to know I'm in Kerala, she texted me saying, 'Anna, come home for dinner,' but I replied, 'No kanna, I'm here just for a day.'\nWhat next on Vikram's plate? Now I working with Arima Nambi's director Anand Shankar and will also do a film with Vijay Milton again. After that I guess I will team up with Bala, but nothing is finalised yet. There is no point in hurrying things, but I want to do at least two films a year, now on. I want to juxtapose them in such a way that the looks in the films too can work out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T14:34:38.268+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
