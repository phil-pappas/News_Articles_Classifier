Watch out. \nCalvin's lawyers might well be in touch after he posted a warning on Twitter. \nHe wrote: \"It's not going to be a 'happy ending' for everyone I sue for defamation of character for all these stories bye bye\". \nDefamation is when an untrue statement leads to some sort of damage, usually to reputation. \nHe's been accused in some media reports of being to blame for \"a break-up\". \nHe's clearly denying that. Taylor then favourited his tweet. \nMeanwhile, Taylor's friend Selena Gomez has been on US radio saying she would know if the pair had really split up. \n\"It's so stupid,\" she told Sirius radio. \n\"I'm 'pregnant' every week, she's 'going to be pregnant'. Honestly, it's so stupid, you can't really read that stuff.\" \nIn June, \"Talvin\" become the highest-paid celebrity couple, overtaking Beyonce and Jay Z. \nThe pair - who it's thought have been dating since March - top this year's Forbes list with a combined income of $146m (Â£92m). \nTaylor has also shaken off rumours she was buying a Scottish castle close to where Calvin's from. \nThere had been rumours Calvin was thinking of proposing - but as he and Selena say, you can't believe everything you read. \nFollow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter, BBCNewsbeat on Instagram, Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube and you can now follow BBC_Newsbeat on Snapchat Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T12:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:53:38.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
