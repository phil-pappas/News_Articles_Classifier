Melanie Brezill and Patrick Budde in ,ÄúThe Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane,Äù by Chicago Children,Äôs Theatre. (Charles Osgood photo /) Chris Jones Contact Reporter The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane; we all need a china rabbit. \nThe hero of \"The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane\" is a rabbit made out of china. Merely moments into the Chicago Children's Theatre's fall production, directed by Stuart Carden, my unprompted 10-year-old son, a big fan of the source novel by Kate DiCamillo, mouthed into my ear the mother of all spoilers. \n\"Thanks a lot,\" I whispered, furiously, in the dark. \nI thus spent the rest of the show feeling a twinge of dread for the made-out-of-china rabbit community, whose delicate collective relationship with the perils of fragility is so much more intense than some cheap, complacent, plush lagomorph you might find at the prize-stand of your average Chuck E. Cheese's. \nEdward also has a further cross to bear — a painted-on mouth that means he cannot actually talk. Well, not in the sense of being heard, although the central conceit of DiCamillo's novel, warmly adapted for the stage by Dwayne Hartford of Childsplay, is that Edward does actually speak an inner narrative, which we, the reader and the audience, can hear. This really is a clever story: On one level it's about Edward's own journey, from vain china rabbit obsessed with his array of matching outfits to a more enlightened rabbit who genuinely loves the various characters with whom he finds himself sharing life's vicissitudes. \nFor Edward is, like so many of us, seriously buffeted by life's unpredictability. He starts out with a 10-year-old girl, Abiline, in the 1930s, only to find himself tossed into the ocean from the deck of the Queen Mary, the victim of a bully's fit of pique. Since no lifeboat was ever launched for a china rabbit, the dude spends 297 days on the ocean floor, only to finally land in a fishing net and wash up for more adventures that I won't detail here. \nSuffice it to say — and here we get to the real nubs of this beautifully written story — Edward becomes party to some very intense relationships, which makes this work quite a far more profound exploration of human (and canine) loneliness than you find in most works for children. The mute rabbit is at once a locus and a security blanket for an array of struggling souls, both young and old, who like holding honest conversations with one who can neither talk back nor judge (although he kinda does). Edward learns to love mostly because he is so loved in return. I'm sorry to go on, but this really is the most charming of narratives, and, if you have a young one from, say, 5-11 years old, you should be able to enjoy some post-show discussion as to why our attachments to our dolls or stuffed animals is so intense. I was thrust back to a memory of leaving my bear, imaginatively named Teddy, in a seaside hotel, and my kind father's willingness to drive back, many miles, to retrieve him. For, without him … well, I did not have to find out. \nChicago Children's Theatre, which is still at the Ruth Page Center for the Arts, prior to completing its planned new home in the West Loop, is an Equity company, which means it can hire terrific actors like Jessie Fisher, who was recently playing The Girl on Broadway in \"Once,\" and Melanie Brezill, who spent ages in \"Mamma Mia.\" Both of these women, who have rich emotional vocabularies, are terrific as the various personalities who love Edward and are loved in return — Brezill, who has more sadness now than I remember earlier in her career, has to play an age range that spans some 70 years, and yet she convinces every time. Kelvin Roston, Jr., another actor who understands life's toughness, is terrific, especially as a hobo who jumps trains all the better when he is hanging onto a china rabbit. \nCarden's staging is mostly effective and intimate, greatly aided by a poignant set from John Musial and emotionally textured costumes from Rachel Healy. That said, there are some truly infuriating sections in which Carden glosses over some of the emotional keys of the story, a frequent issue with this otherwise talented director. Yes, this is a kid's show, but children can understand loss and death if it is presented honestly to them, with specificity; there's no need to blow past these moments. I was especially frustrated by Patrick Budde's invulnerability (he is a charming fellow but he does seem to go through much trauma, unlike the rabbit he is voicing). And his cute but fake rabbit voice is completely unnecessary when Edward, surely, is just one of us, a cipher for his owners and very much his own rabbit. Budde needs some skin in the game as Edward does, or would, if he had any skin. \nHis fellow actors — what a trio are Brezill, Fisher and Roston — certainly are unafraid of human need for companionship. Edward's journey is accompanied by rich songs composed by Fisher and Erik Hellmann. And, for the record, what I feared would be his end was — well, I will leave it there. China rabbits are born with certain advantages. \nChris Jones is a Tribune critic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T20:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T20:52:24.268+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
