The firm has been in business for more than 32 years supplying, installing and servicing water well pumps and irrigation systems for domestic, commercial and agricultural needs. The business is offered for sale as a share purchase. Included in the purchase price are more than $100,000 worth of the equipment, tools and inventory necessary to continue to successfully operate the business. In addition, there is a comprehensive customer database containing more than two thousand names. Because of the extensive customer list, the customer base is very diverse, with no one customer contributing more than 10% to the annual revenues of business. Revenues and profitability are both increasing as the economy on Vancouver Island continues to recover. The water well pump service and installation industry segment is very stable and continues to grow as developers look to rural properties to increase inventory. The business maintains strong profit margins and has very limited debt. Over the years, the firmï¿½s commitment to service has resulted in them taking market share from their competitors and they are now considered industry leaders. As with any business, there is competition, but the competitors are few and barriers to entry are high enough to dissuade many potential entrants. If you are a hands-on individual looking for an opportunity to generate a significant, sustainable income though business ownership this business is right for you. For more information contact Keith MacKenzie for more information. This is not a BC PNP eligible business.
