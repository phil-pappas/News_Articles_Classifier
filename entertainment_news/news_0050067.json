You can browse fun, specialty products, learn the hottest fall fashion and beauty tips, attend a cooking class with regional chefs, and even get a complimentary haircut. Special celebrity guests this year include Jessica Duggar Seewald of 19 Kids and Counting and Britt Nilsson of The Bachelor/Bachelorette, who will both be hosting Q&A panel sessions. Admission to the show is $8 in advance online at southernshows.com , or $10 at the door. After 3 p.m. Thursday, admission is $3, and after 5 p.m. Friday and Saturday, admission is $5. 5 QUESTIONS WITH BRITT \nWe chatted with Britt about what she'll be discussing at the show, her role models, dating advice, and her best fall fashion tips. \nBirmingham Magazine: What will you be talking about at the show? \nBritt Nilsson: Part of the panel is a Q&A where I'll be talking about being on The Bachelor/Bachelorette – what it was really like, how the girls were, how having two Bachelorettes was the most awkward night of my life. But most of it is going to be about my personal journey and how I now have a platform to talk about a charity I support: World Vision. You sponsor a child for $35/month and it gives them clean water, education, medicine they might need. I sponsor ten children and it's just the sweetest thing. They write me letters and draw pictures. You actually get to see what you're doing to change someone's life and that's amazing. \nBM: What do you think defines the modern Southern woman? \nBN: What I love most about Southern women is they're all so kind. It takes confidence to be kind to other women and I think Southern women have that. Living in Los Angeles, it's really different how people interact. Everyone in the South is very generous, complimentary, and just all-around kind. Southern hospitality is real! \nBM: Who has been your greatest female role model? \nBN: It sounds so cliché, but it really is my mom. She's everything to me. She's my best friend and she's always taught me to build people up. She taught me the power of words you speak over someone and how it's so important to be positive and encouraging. She talks kindly over everyone and I want to do that. It's an especially tough time to be growing up now and I want to be able to encourage young women. \nBM: In this time of social media and accessibility, what's your best dating advice? \nBN: Don't stalk someone on social media before you meet them. If you sit there and go through their entire Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, it cheats you out of those interesting and organic moments of getting to know someone. It's those sweet moments of letting that person tell you about himself or herself that builds a relationship. You learn what they want to show you, not what their Facebook profile portrays. \nBM: What's your go-to fall outfit? \nBN: High-waisted black jeans with a cropped sweater and boots with a little bit of a heel. I switch up the sweaters and accessorize with crazy jewelry and it's a look that pretty much works for anything. \nWhat: Southern Women's Show", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T08:01:44.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
