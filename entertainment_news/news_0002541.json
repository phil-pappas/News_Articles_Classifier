The hunky actor recently told Access Hollywood that he wished they could have announced the happy news together. \"I thought it was gonna be a secret but she just decided to let the cat out of the bag,\" the 40-year-old actor jokingly told the news outlet. Bradley then said that he texted Amy following the show. \"I texted with her after. I was like, 'That was hilarious.' \" It wasn't the first time Amy included his name into her story. \"The truth is I remember I met her and then she was on a talk show and made up some story that I pretended to avoid her,\" he explained. Later on, Bradley called out the stand-up comedian when the two met at the TIME 100 gala red carpet. \"And when I saw her on the red carpet I was like, 'Hey man, you made up some bulls**t story,' and she was like 'Oh I'm sorry,' \" the actor explained with a laugh. Bradley assumed that the faux engagement was to make up for the false story about him in the past. \"So maybe she's making up for that now ... cause I called her on it,\" he said. \"It was like, 'Dude, what are you talking about?' \" During her monologue on \"SNL\", Amy said, \"Am I dating Bradley Cooper? And I changed my Facebook status. Well I'm not complicated [but] I'm engaged to Bradley Cooper.\" She had previously recounted similar story about dating the actor minus engagement announcement on \" The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon \". \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T09:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:46:57.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
