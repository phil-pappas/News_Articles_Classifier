Zolciak's new act is an inspirational speaker. \nThe reality star announced Wednesday she's set to embark on a 20-city speaking tour, titled the \"Ask Believe Receive Tour: Tips, Tools and Dedication. Manifesting the Life You Have Always Dreamed Of.\" It kicks off in Atlanta in December. \n\"I'm so flipping EXCITED I have talked about this for years and I'm finally doing it!\" Zolciak-Bierman wrote on Instagram along with a promotional image for the tour. \nA multi-city tour is definitely a big step for the reality star as on her show, Don't Be Tardy , cameras followed Zolciak-Bierman as she spoke at a women's empowerment event. The cameras also caught Zolciak-Bierman freaking out before the event and eventually free-styling a speech that brought some audience members to tears. \n\"You guys really motivated me after watching some of my speech on Don't Be Tardy the comments/emails you guys wrote me were awesome,\" she wrote on Instagram. \nZolciak-Bierman continued that she just didn't wake up and know how to address a crowd. Instead, she got help from a coach and now wants to pay those lessons forward. \nNews of the reality star's tour comes after she revealed last week that she'll have surgery to repair a small hole in her heart. That hole caused a mini-stroke, which led to her hospitalization and eventual elimination from Dancing with the Stars last month. She's set to return to the ABC competition's finale, though there's no word yet if she'll dance. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
