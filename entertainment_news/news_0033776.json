They sawed it in three pieces. \nBarrymore, star of such films as \"Grand Hotel\" and grandfather of actress Drew Barrymore, displayed the pole in the garden of his California estate. \nLangdon learned the totem pole was used for burials, and he said there were remains of a man inside when Barrymore had it erected at his home. Langdon does not know what happened to the remains after they were removed from the pole. \nAfter Barrymore's death, actor Vincent Price, known for horror flicks such as \"House of Wax,\" and his wife bought the item and also used it as a yard decoration. The couple donated it to the Honolulu Museum of Art in 1981. \nMuseum officials will give the pole back to the Tlingit (KLINK'-it) people at a ceremony Thursday. The pole was among more than 100 that once stood in the old village of Tuxecan on Prince of Wales Island, Alaska, which was inhabited by the Tlingit people, the museum said in a news release. \nOf the original Tuxecan poles, only two remain, both in Klawock, the southeast village of 80 people where the tribe moved, according to the museum.
