He said he knew exactly when he contracted the virus, and that he \"didn't want to be that guy\" for anyone else. \n\"There's this awful feeling of, I'm never going to be able to have a good relationship,\" he told Oprah Winfrey, discussing his reaction to the news in March 2003. \"No one's ever going to want me.' ... That moment of, 'Oh, God, I'm now going to have to have that conversation every time I meet someone. Who's going to want to love me?'\" \nPintauro, who was forced to come out about his sexuality in 1997 after a tabloid told him it was going to out him whether he participated or not, now wants to be an activist about HIV and the dangers of crystal meth. \n\"I guarantee you he will change so many lives,\" Milano said Tuesday. \"And I'm so grateful that this disease is now being discussed again because it feels like there was such a long time that it wasn't.\" \nEchoing some of Pintauro's words from the Oprah sit-down, she declared, \"He is a beacon of light, and he will be.\" \nShe said she had \"no idea\" that her former costar was HIV-positive, because she'd fallen out of contact with him since their show wrapped in 1992 after eight seasons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:12:15.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
