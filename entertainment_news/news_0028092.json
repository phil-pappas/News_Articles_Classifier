The new attendance record tops the previous daily average record of 1,027 customers per day, which was set last month. Kentucky Downs has set a new attendance record in each of the three months since Encore's games were fully deployed at Kentucky Downs. The large number of patrons at Kentucky Downs helped generate over $29.5 million in historic horse racing handle in September, an increase of nearly 12% over last September and the highest September handle number on record. Since being fully deployed in July, the Encore games have produced three of the four highest handle months on record at Kentucky Downs.\n\"The Encore Games are clearly setting the standard in historic horse racing,\" commented Kentucky Downs General Manager Nick Hughes . \"The numbers speak for themselves. Our current customers are very happy with the Encore product and are clearly giving a vote of total acceptance as they are visiting us more often, and we are having great success attracting and keeping new customers. The wide variety of modern game themes and wager types, coupled with significantly larger pari-mutuel pool sizes and jackpots, has generated an unprecedented level of enthusiasm from our customers.\"\nEncore President Jeremy Stein remarked: \"We are gratified that the patrons at Kentucky Downs continue to embrace the Encore product by producing record attendance numbers each of the last three months. As we prepare to launch even more new and innovative game themes in the next two months, we fully expect for Kentucky Downs to continue breaking attendance and handle records.\"\nFor more information about the company and the EncoreRBG historic horse racing system, visit www.encorerbg.com , or the EncoreRBG Facebook page.\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150211/174951LOGO\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kentucky-downs-and-encore-break-attendance-handle-records-for-third-straight-month-300152759.html\nÂ©2015 PR Newswire.
