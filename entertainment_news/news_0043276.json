Perhaps this could be something to consider this week; as sensitive vulnerabilities continue to expand with the Full Moon on Tuesday October 27. During the Full Moon, our thoughts and New Moon intentions come to a peak, bringing exposure to what has remained secretive or in the dark. What is necessary and illuminates truth; is released – resulting in endings and finales. And with the Full Moon grinding hard and steadily in determined Taurus, we’ll be more encouraged to finish up with what we’ve been working on in the last few weeks. \nThe greatest achievement of the human spirit is to live up to one’s opportunities and make the most of one’s resources.
