On possibility of introducing ETF-based on commodities following the FMC merger with Sebi, Sinha said that introduction of new players and products would be happen after a few months. “We first have to be fully satisfied that all regulations and safeguards are in place,” Sinha said. ”We don’t want any negative surprises to happen. This will take a few months. Once that is over allowing new products and players would start happening,” he added noting that the regulator would go for product development and business development once the system is tested. Speaking at the conference, Sinha said the primary reason for having an ETF is liquidity but one has to guard against whether the liquidity is available at the time of stress or not. “In case there is a crisis and people get perception that there are serious risks it could effect the product. There could also be situation that underlying is actually not liquid while the ETF is liquid, such things should also be avoided,” Sinha said. He further said that more disclosures with regard to ETF are required so as to benefit the investors. An ETF is a marketable security that tracks an index, a commodity, bonds, or a basket of assets like an index fund. \nModified Date: October 26, 2015 5:10 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T13:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:18:28.811+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
