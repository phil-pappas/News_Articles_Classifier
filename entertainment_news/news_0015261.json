This victory is of peace, democracy and also an effort for the dialogue process between India and Pakistan,” Kulkarni told ANI here. \n“I believe we have many tough questions in front of us and today we discussed those questions. We talked about terrorism and said Mumbai has been the greatest victim of it. We want Pakistan to listen to us so that we can solve issues through dialogue processes,” he added.
