As well as feeling like an outsider in her new home, she also felt guilt at leaving loved one behind. In the absence of self-help books that could guide her, she sought solace in speaking to other migrants and eventually penned a book recounting her experiences to give other newcomers the support that she had found lacking. \nShe says: \"I found comfort and support in talking with other migrants and I hope this talk, which includes other migrant stories and coping strategies, does the same for other newcomers. This talk has been developed to help all migrants, regardless of how long they have been in New Zealand.\" \nBaker says the talk will help newcomers overcome the challenges that were not anticipated arise when \"the excitement of being in a new country dies down\". \n\"This talk will identify some of those challenges and offer solutions to overcoming the challenges or even preventing them. It will give tools to help you become a more settled immigrant.\" \nLeeda Ferdis, Senior Librarian at Mt Roskill Library says she was delighted the library and ARMS are collaborating with Baker on the talk. She says: \"Mt Roskill Library and Auckland Regional Migrant Services have a solid relationship in working together to help integrate new migrants. This talk will give an insight into the challenges most new immigrants face, ideas to overcome challenges and give hope and encouragement to our new migrants starting life in New Zealand.\" \nRegional Communications Manager Chinwe Akomah, who organised the talk with the library and Baker, says: \"Moving to a new country is never easy. There are emotional challenges as well as logistical obstacles to overcome. Newcomers want to hear how other migrants overcame the same challenges they are facing. It gives them hope and offers at light at the end of the tunnel and we are pleased to continue to find ways make the process of settling into Auckland easier for migrants.\" \nThe talk will be held at ARMS offices at 532 Mt Albert Road, Three Kings Plaza, Three Kings. \nRefreshments will be provided.
