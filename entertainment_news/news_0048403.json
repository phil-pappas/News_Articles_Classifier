In a new Billboard cover story published on October 8, the \"Good for You\" singer admitted that she underwent chemotherapy as she was diagnosed with lupus. \"I was diagnosed with lupus, and I've been through chemotherapy. That's what my break was really about. I could've had a stroke,\" Selena revealed. She was totally upset when she's rumored having drug addiction while her physical change was because of the chemotherapy. \"I wanted so badly to say, 'You guys have no idea. I'm in chemotherapy. You're a**holes.' I locked myself away until I was confident and comfortable again,\" she said.

I've been working since I was 7. I've been a UNICEF ambassador since I was 17. It's so disappointing that I've become a tabloid story,\" Selena said. However, she said, \"The hate motivated me.\" Selena also revealed her first experience being body-shamed earlier this year. \"I was in a bikini and got publicly ripped for being overweight,\" she told the magazine. \"That was the first time I'd experienced body shaming like that. I believed some of the words they were saying. When somebody else has your self-esteem in their hands.\" Nevertheless, she then decided to bare her body on the cover of \" Revival \" as she's no longer afraid of the criticisms she would recive. Living in the pop world where she's often mistreated and misperceived, Selena is reluctant to allow new people into her life. Her friendship with Taylor Swift has helped her trust others. \"Taylor makes me feel empowered, like I can trust new people,\" she said of her best pal. \"The way she cares about women is so adamant. It's pulling me out of my shell.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:56:22.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
