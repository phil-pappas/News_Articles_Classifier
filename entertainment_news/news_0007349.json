(AP Photo/Jae C. Hong) LAS VEGAS (FOX5) - \nFormer basketball and reality television star Lamar Odom remained hospitalized in Las Vegas on Friday, but his condition is improving, according to multiple reports. \nOdom was found unconscious at Dennis Hof’s Bunny Ranch near Pahrump on Tuesday afternoon. \nAuthorities said that Odom had been at the brothel since Saturday afternoon, and had taken several herbal Viagra pills. On Tuesday afternoon, workers at the brothel went into Odom’s room to check on him and found him unresponsive with a white substance coming from his nose and blood coming from his mouth. \nOdom was taken to Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas, where he has been on life-support since his arrival. \nOn Friday, TMZ reported that doctors were attempting to wean Odom off life-support by regularly swapping his ventilator with an oxygen mask. He was able to breathe on his own while wearing the mask, the website reported. \nOther media outlets reported Friday that Odom opened his eyes and was able to communicate, but it wasn’t clear if that communication was verbal. \nInvestigators said tests are being conducted on Odom’s blood to determine what drugs were in his system at the time he became unconscious. However, workers at the brothel said Odom told them he had been doing cocaine before he arrived there. \nKhloe Kardashian, Odom’s ex-wife, has been by his bedside, according to TMZ. The website also reported that former teammate Kobe Bryant left a preseason game of the Los Angeles Lakers being played in Las Vegas on Tuesday night to be by Odom’s side. \nOdom has played for both the Los Angeles Lakers and the Los Angeles Clippers, as well as the Miami Heat and the Dallas Mavericks. \nThe 35-year-old retired from the NBA in 2013 and saw reality TV fame through his four-year marriage to Kardashian. \nCopyright 2015 KVVU (KVVU Broadcasting Corporation).
