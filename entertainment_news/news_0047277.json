It, like \"An Inconvenient Truth,\" gave him the opportunity to dig deep into political issues.\nThose are important reasons. But, none was more important than the one reason that touched him the most.\n\"I have two daughters and one of them is extremely shy. I kept wondering what this girl's father did to help make this girl feel so confident. I wanted to know his secrets as a father,\" Guggenheim says.\n\"He Named Me Malala\" looks at the young Pakistani who was shot by the Taliban because of her outspoken efforts for education for girls. She survived the attack and has become a global voice.\nThe movie also examines the relationship between Malala and her father, Ziauddin, who influenced the young girl to speak out in a world where such freedoms are not often upheld.\nGuggenheim has dealt with important issues in his documentaries, from global warming in \"An Inconvenient Truth\" to education in \"Waiting for Superman.\" He says that while the roots of documentaries are in journalism, he finds that it is impossible to remain perfectly objective when tackling these topics.\nThe director says he must have a passion for the subject before he will take on the project.\n\"I want to feel what my characters are going through and help my audience feel that too,\" Guggenheim says.\nThat search for passion isn't confined to documentaries. Davis has been directing both documentaries and scripted productions for 20 years. His scripted work includes episodes of \"ER,\" \"NYPD Blue,\" \"The Shield,\" \"Deadwood\" and \"Numb3rs.\"\nAlthough the bulk of his credits are scripted shows, Guggenheim loves making documentaries. That passion for the film form has only increased with \"He Named Me Malala\" because of screenings where he's watched the faces of young girls light up while watching the story unfold.\nHis daughters -- with actress Elisabeth Shue -- are 14 and 9. Guggenheim says it was a special moment when they met Malala.\n\"They have become close. I am really happy they have a hero who can lead them in the right direction. There are a lot of heroes out there who are false heroes. Malala is so genuine and right,\" Guggenheim says.\nGuggenheim was brought in to direct when the producers of \"He Named Me Malala\" decided the young woman's story had to be told as a documentary. As Guggenheim began to do his research, he began to see there was more than just this massive story of global importance. He also saw the strong family angle.\nEither way, he wanted to tell the story of Malala. And that story had to be both Malala as a world figure and as an average teen. He presents her story that way because he wants to show that what makes Malala so extraordinary is a simple courageous choice to speak out for something in which she believed strongly.\nThe director tells most of Malala's story through a traditional documentary style. But for events happening in the past, he opted to use animation.\n\"When I met with the family the first times, it was long interviews without a crew. I just wanted them to tell their story,\" Guggenheim says. \"They would start to tell these stories of time past that were so beautiful and so important and so lyrical.\n\"So, I had this audio and I was trying to think what pictures to put with it. Images we get from this area is often so negative, I needed a different way to show it. That's why I decided to go with animation.\"\nGuggenheim found a passionate connection with the story of Malala. It's a project that touched him both as a documentary filmmaker and as a father.\n\"Sometimes you see these heroes that we put up and they are on the morning shows and they are touring around,\" Guggenheim says. \"Over time, they tend to disappoint you.\n\"Every time I see Malala, the opposite happens with me. I have such admiration for her and her family. I think they are lovely and they have taught me a lot.\"\n(c)2015 The Fresno Bee (Fresno, Calif.)\nVisit The Fresno Bee (Fresno, Calif.) at www.fresnobee.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1734063&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1734063&h=%27Malala%27+director+influenced+by+daughters+to+tell+heroic+story", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1734063"], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:13:38.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
