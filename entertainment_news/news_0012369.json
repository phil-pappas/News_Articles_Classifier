All are welcome. \nCamden architect Glass will explore the history of the labyrinth, from its occurrences in prehistory to its resurgence in recent years as a place for spiritual practices. This lecture is based on a course given last spring at the Senior College in Belfast. \nAttendees will learn the historical distinctions between labyrinths and mazes; learn how to draw the classical labyrinth and its variants — Greek and Roman labyrinths, the legend of Theseus and Ariadne, Daedalus and Icarus, and the Roman labyrinths based on the legend; medieval church labyrinths showing how Theseus became the Armed Man and the Minotaur became Satan; musical labyrinths and the circle of fifths. \nAlso considered will be puzzle mazes from their origins to contemporary examples, including mazes in films; and contemplative labyrinths, hearing what their makers and users have to say about them. The free talk is part of the library’s Discover History month. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
