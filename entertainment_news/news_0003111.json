Following a proposal by the TN government, it’s feared that students will be left without the option to learn Telugu and that learning Tamil could be enforced. Groups such as the Tamil Nadu Telugu Yuva Sakthi, led by Kethireddy Jagadeeswara Reddy, hope Pawan Kalyan, and other leading lights of Tollywood, could be roped in. “It will not just help students but it will also boost the Telugu language in both the states,” says filmmaker Thammareddy Bharadwaj, who is part of the protests. However, Pawan did not turn up for a protest event that was planned earlier. The reason could be a rumoured advisory from the BJP who don’t want to see their alliance with CM Jayalalithaa’s AIADMK, troubled. “(Union Minister Venkaiah) Naidu requested Pawan Kalyan not to do anything against Jayalalithaa. Which is why he dropped the idea,” a source said.
