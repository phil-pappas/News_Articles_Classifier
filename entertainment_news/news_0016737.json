It makes sense then that Indian restaurants and other restaurants specializing in global cuisines are routinely some of the most friendly for vegetarians and vegans considering a larger percentage of their population follows a strictly plant-based diet.\nDon’t get me wrong, I love meat, but I also enjoy a laid-back meatless Monday, when my husband and I take the day off from animal protein and work to incorporate more fruits and vegetables into our diet.\nThere’s no lack of investigation and documentation on the health benefits of plant-based diets, including research that suggests help with the prevention of — and in some cases help treating — diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease, so I figure one or two days each week to go green is probably a good thing.\nAnd I’m not alone. With the gospel of plant-based nutrition increasingly finding its way to more mainstream outlets, more consumers are becoming aware of the health benefits and the options that are out there. A 2012 National Harris Poll by the Vegetarian Resource group found that 47 percent of respondents say they eat at least one vegetarian meal per week.\nWith increased interest in eating healthy, the trend toward following a diet with more fruits and vegetables is catching on at dining rooms across the country. According to a National Restaurant Association survey, vegetarian cuisine is one of the fastest growing categories in the United States and Canada — that’s something worth celebrating if you are one of the approximately 16 million Americans that identify as a vegetarian.\nThe National Restaurant Association’s “What’s Hot 2014 Culinary Forecast” had 57 percent of the participating chefs saying meatless and vegetarian menu items will be a top trend going forward.\nFortunately for us, there is no lack of wonderful vegetarian options on menus across the Miami Valley featuring international cuisine. Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Mexican, Indian, Middle Eastern and Italian restaurants all are known for getting creative with produce and flavorful herbs and spices in the kitchen.\nStill, there are many local restaurants that could use far more options on the menu that give fruits and vegetables the attention that they deserve.\nI may love meat, but I also love lentils, squash, parsnips, artichokes, cauliflower, avocado, okra, leeks, tofu, Brussel sprouts, beets, greens, tofu and so many other wonderful ingredients that I don’t encounter on menus nearly enough when ordering.\nAnd don’t get me started on fruit. There’s not nearly enough of it being served up when dining out in Dayton.\nI always love going to Wheat Penny and seeing the phrase “eat your vegetables!” printed on the menu. The restaurant takes its vegetables very seriously. The green beans with soy sauce vinaigrette and anchovy mayo ($7.95) is the stuff of dining dreams.\nFor many diners produce is a boring, flavorless choice. I only wish more local restaurants in town would consider proving them wrong.\nDayton Eats looks at the regional food stories and restaurant news that make mouths water.
