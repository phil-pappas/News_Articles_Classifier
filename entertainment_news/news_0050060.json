Posted yesterday at 2:00am \nABC/Randy Holmes (NEW YORK) -- Emily Blunt is finally coming clean on why she decided to become a U.S. citizen earlier this year. \n\"It's mainly for tax reasons,\" Blunt told the U.K.'s Sunday Times' Style magazine. \"I didn't want to renounce my Queen.\" \nBlunt said the process required much effort. \"You have to learn all about the Constitution. You can't be a habitual drunk, you can't be on a guerrilla squad and you can't be a prostitute, which is a shame,\" she quipped. \nThat wasn't the first tongue-in-cheek comment the Sicario star made about becoming an American. In fact, one joke landed her in a bit of hot water last month. Blunt jokingly told The Hollywood Reporter : \"I became an American citizen recently, and that night, we watched the Republican debate, and I thought, 'This was a terrible mistake. What have I done?'\" \nThe actress later apologized on the Today show for her remarks, calling them \"an offhand joke.\" \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
