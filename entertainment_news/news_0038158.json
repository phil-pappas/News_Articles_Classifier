A solemn blessing of an outdoor altar decorated with photos of loved ones and offerings of maize was followed by an Americanized, but not yet trivialized or commercialized, version of a custom that started thousands of years.

(Josie Lepe/ Bay Area News Group) ( Josie Lepe ) \nMany historians believe that Los Dias de los Muertos actually began as a harvest ritual that predated the Aztecs. The ancients believed that only the dead could speak to the gods, and their astrology told them that mid-autumn offered the thinnest membrane between Earth and the afterlife. By offering the bounty of harvest, the people believed the spirits of their loved ones might put in a good word for them to the gods. \nSunday's procession and festival showed that Day of the Dead has clearly evolved into something else in 21st century Silicon Valley. For example, it included a Filipino dance group, belly dancers and celebrants sporting genuine dreadlocks. Ever since the resurrection of Day of the Dead celebrations in the United States during the 1960s, Sagun said, Mexican-Americans have infused the observances with bicultural flair and even politics.
