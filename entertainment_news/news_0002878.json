His claims against Salzman and the association in a third-party countersuit remain intact.\nAttorneys for all of the parties declined to comment.\nMeanwhile, a trial originally set for next month to hear Papst's claims against Danks has been postponed indefinitely. Mediation and settlement talks between Danks and Papst have so far been unfruitful, according to court records and testimony. Papst once declined a $2 million settlement offer by Danks.\nPapst, of Austin, Texas, also sued his brother, Waylon.\nWhite Sox's John Danks at center of drama involving friend paralyzed at condo Jared S.

Hopkins) The legal drama, chronicled in May by the Tribune after reviewing court records and sworn deposition testimony, grew out of a chaotic evening following a Sox game. Records show that it wasn't until the morning that Danks and Papst's brother carried Blake Papst back inside, and an ambulance wasn't called until that evening, hours after Danks left for that night's Sox game, according to police and court records.\nIn court filings, Danks has denied wrongdoing, saying that he wasn't responsible for Papst's injuries and that Waylon Papst discouraged him from seeking medical assistance for Blake. Additionally, in a court deposition, Danks said it was up to Papst's brother to make that decision and the brother didn't call because Blake lacked insurance.\nTuesday marked the second try by Papst, Salzman and the condo association to have O'Hara approve an agreement.\nIn August, O'Hara denied their motion for a \"good faith finding\" for a $475,000 settlement, partly because they didn't provide him details of the settlement. Such findings are typical when some, not all, of the parties want to settle.\nDiffering accounts of fall, aftermath at White Sox pitcher John Danks' condo (timeline) Chicago Tribune Graphics Five years ago, White Sox pitcher John Danks invited childhood friend, Waylon Papst, and his brother, Blake, to fly from Texas to Chicago for a visit.

(Chicago Tribune Graphics) But on Tuesday, Danks' attorney, David Nordwall, told the judge that there was no objection to the latest motion, which dismissed the claims against Salzman and the association.\nThat was a shift from the proposed settlement from August, which Danks opposed because it would have dismissed claims Danks brought in a countersuit against Salzman and the association.\nUnder Tuesday's action by O'Hara, Danks' claims remain intact.\njahopkins@tribpub.com\nTwitter @jaredshopkins\n John Danks Chicago White Sox Sports Baseball", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5568ab5a/turbine/ct-danks-sox-lawsuit-fall-20150529", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561e9259/turbine/ct-danks-lawsuit-settlement-20151014", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5568dd9e/turbine/ct-john-danks-deck-accident-timeline-20150528"], "published": "2015-10-14T20:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:33:34.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
