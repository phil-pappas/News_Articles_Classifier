It feels so good to be here,\" the 46-year-old funnyman said in his warm and humble monologue as guest host.\n\"As most of you know, I was in a terrible car accident a year ago. It was awful, but it also showed me how much love and support I have in this world. So, a couple of months ago, I called [ SNL chief] Lorne Michaels , he's my Obi Wan Kenobi, and I said, 'Lorne, when I get back on my feet, I want to come home.' And here I am! People are wondering: 'Can he speak?' 'Does he have 100 percent mental capacity?' But the truth is, I never did. I might actually be a few points higher now. But, through it all, I am so lucky I had my comedy family. When this happened, I knew they would all be there to support me.\"\nMorgan and his former 30 Rock co-stars -- Alec Baldwin , Tina Fey , Jane Krakowski and Jack McBrayer -- reunited for a sketch, while another segment featured Morgan reviving his SNL character Brian Fellow, the undereducated host of Safari Planet .\nIn addition, the comedian appeared in sketches about a dangerous-seeming bar patron who just wants to tango; Jackie Chan fans trying to find out where the action-hero is; and an episode of the game show Family Feud that goes awry.\nMorgan was an SNL cast member from 1996 to 2003.\n Tracy Morgan returns to stand-up for first time since car accident Ice Cube, Charlie Day start work on 'Fist Fight' movie, Tracy Morgan to co-star 'Minority Report' producer says series-order cutback won't impact Season 1 storytelling Melissa Leo, Sebastian Stan to star in Jim Carrey-produced comedy pilot for Showtime", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/H9UkjPF5X6o", "https://facebook.com/unitedpress", "https://www.facebook.com/UnitedPress"], "published": "2015-10-18T19:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:33:25.339+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
