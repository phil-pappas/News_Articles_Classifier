The event will be held at 3 p.m. on Sunday, Nov. 8, in the Schechter Auditorium of the library. While most famously a North Carolina State Senator from 1993 until his retirement in 2010, Albertson has also had a long and successful career as a professional musician, songwriter and publisher, as well as a recording artist who has appeared at the Grand Ole Opry several times. He has also appeared on the Wilburn Brothers’ syndicated television show, the Ernest Tubb Midnight Jamboree, the Arthur Smith TV Show and the Jimmy Snow Gospel hour. The public is invited for a rollicking afternoon full of exhilarating country music. For reservations, call the library at 252-527-7066, ext. 120.
