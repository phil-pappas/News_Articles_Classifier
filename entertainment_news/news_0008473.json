I rarely do trigger warnings, but since Ryan Murphy insists on jamming his shows full of rape scenes, I have to let you know that the one in AHS: Hotel is more violent than ever before.\nTo begin: It was cool to see the show set up through the two lithe, blonde European travelers who, like our forefathers, came to America for their love of Vin Diesel and amusement park rides. Through their instantly terrified eyes, we got a look at the Hotel Cortez, an old-school art deco building filled with new-school creeps that is powered by murder fumes, heroin, and Kathy Bates. Listen: If you check into a mostly empty hotel filled with sex sounds, no Wi-Fi, and someone from housekeeping steaming blood out of a sheet in the hallway, forget your non-refundable deposit and get the hell out of there. I'd rather sleep in a booth at Denny's than stay in some creeped-out filth den. And for god's sake, if your mattress has a foul smell leaking out of it and a long, jagged, sewn-up cut down the center, don't try to find out what's inside . It's not like a Benedict Cumberbatch is going to leap out of there holding a puppy — a saggy-skinned goblin is going to pop out and ruin your life, and you'll probably deserve it.\n They're not triplets?! Share Tweet Pin E-mail FX More From Cosmopolitan It's not fair to cast Wes Bentley, Matt Bomer, and Cheyenne Jackson in the same show without making them related. I know they're different people! But try telling that to my eyeballs. Let's try to keep it straight:\nWes Bentley is the cop, John Lowe. And not a doughnut-eating, speed-gun holding cop; he's more of a serial-killer-chasing, \"start the day investigating an eyeless, tongueless man alive with his penis glued inside of the dead woman he was boning\" kind of cop. He lost his son at the pier when he was checking his texts, his wife is Chloë Sevigny, and when he brought his daughter to a murder scene, she saw two disemboweled men dangling from the ceiling. Chloë pinned up her Sister Wives hair and kicked him out after that, so he moved into the Hotel Cortez and straight into the room the serial killer directed him to earlier in the episode. Thus far, Lowe is very bad at both copping and decision-making.\nMatt Bomer is Donovan, the ex-junkie vampire who lives in the penthouse with Lady Gaga. He likes to slash people's throat while he's boning them, and he hates sunlight. He is also Kathy Bates's son, and he died in the hotel when Sarah Paulson (Hypodermic Sally) helped him OD on heroin. It's a real family affair up in this piece.\nCheyenne Jackson is Will Drake, the new owner of the hotel. He lets Lady Gaga take his kid away while he's checking out the building and one of the first things he says is that New York is over, so it's totally OK to hate him.\nSpeaking of Lady Gaga: She is act ng Share Tweet Pin E-mail FX As The Countess Elizabeth, Gaga is definitely cut from the same cloth as the best-dressed goths at the club. She seems to be an art collector and occasional child thief. (Holden, John Lowe's missing son, is one of the four little blonde kids that terrorize the hotel guests before disappearing into their video game den inside the walls. A grip of blondes is never a good sign.) The Countess runs things in the hotel with the pointy finger guards she and Donovan use to quickly slash throats and drink blood, starting with the couple they brought home for a foursome that was gruesome and shockingly explicit, even for FX. She also killed one of the Euro girls when Vendela ran away from Iris (remember: Kathy Bates). She seems to be an OG evil presence in corporeal form. It's unclear if she's dead or alive, although my guess is alive.\nDefinitely dead is Sally, whom Iris pushed out of a window as payback. Sally still hangs around to terrorize guests and watch them get raped (more on that in a moment). As for whether Liz Taylor (Denis O'Hare) is dead or alive — who knows? We just know he'll do anything for a dollar. ​\nMax Greenfield looks really good as a blonde, but that scene... The very worst part of the hotel so far is the saggy-skinned, strap-on-wearing rapist. To say this scene was disturbing is an understatement — Gabriel goes to this hotel to get high and ends up on his stomach being raped by something wearing a sharp, metal, drill bit-like device. Then the rapist just disappears. Is this the serial killer? I can't take an entire season of this and I'm not even kidding. If you see a skin sack, say something.\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail FX Another tip: Never trust a white woman who calls herself \"mama.\" Kathy Bates, as Iris, is barely on screen for a half hour before she's caging the Euro girls in neon tubes and force-feeding them chicken liver, kidney, and oyster shakes. Bates is a tremendous actress, but I love that she's given herself over so fully to being a full-time creep.\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail FX This entire show is based on the song \"Hotel California\" Some of the people are dead, some are alive, none of it makes sense, and you'll want to strangle Don Henley at the end for no discernible reason.\nI didn't love this episode, and I'm not sure how I feel about how the season will shape up. It was brutal and violent, and also kind of aimless. My theory is that The Countess Elizabeth rules the school, and everyone else works to bring her blood and bodies. But there's also a nebulous owner from whom Will Drake bought the place, so that could play into this? It's possible the whole building is haunted from way back. It's possible I'm already scarred for life.\n​Follow Danielle on Twitter .", "external_links": ["http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/480x721/gallery-1444314053-ahs-gabriel.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1600x800/landscape-1444315143-three-dudes.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1280x640/gallery-1444315143-three-dudes.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/640x320/gallery-1444315143-three-dudes.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1600x800/gallery-1444315143-three-dudes.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1444313815-american-horror-story-hotel-premiere-recap.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/640x320/landscape-1444314053-ahs-gabriel.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/640x360/gallery-1444313815-american-horror-story-hotel-premiere-recap.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/640x240/gallery-1444313743-blood-orgy-american-horror-story-hotel.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/640x320/landscape-1444313815-american-horror-story-hotel-premiere-recap.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/980x490/gallery-1444315143-three-dudes.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/480x180/gallery-1444313743-blood-orgy-american-horror-story-hotel.jpg", "https://twitter.com/knottyyarn?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/640x961/gallery-1444314053-ahs-gabriel.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1444314053-ahs-gabriel.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/480x240/gallery-1444315143-three-dudes.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/768x384/gallery-1444315143-three-dudes.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/480x270/gallery-1444313815-american-horror-story-hotel-premiere-recap.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T18:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:24:32.328+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
