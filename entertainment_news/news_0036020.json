As Season 6 begins, viewers are waiting to hear what will happen to their favorite, almost cartoon-like characters.\nThe preview was a much-abbreviated presentation, but it did tease us with a bit of information about what to look for in the new season. The most shocking news on this short glimpse of the future was the sight of Parker Schnabel's right-hand man, Gene, working for someone else. To top it off, that someone was Parker's nemesis claim owner, Tony Beets! Gene was shown operating Beets’ newly-reconstructed, 70-year-old dredge. Beets was also shown throwing Parker off of the claim, much to Parker’s disbelief. He asked Tony Beets how many times before he had thrown him off.\nThe Hoffmans have a lot to prove this season as Todd’s teenage son joins the operation. Oddly, Todd’s top competitor, Parker Schnabel, is merely a few years older than his young son, and that has to be a slap in the face. Family becomes even more important to the Beets family, too, as they were shown pulling together to make the ancient dredge become productive once again. Speaking of family, viewers have also wondered about the condition of Parker Schnabel’s grandpa over the off-season. He is apparently still around, at least at the time of filming, and still giving sound advice to his grandson, according to this short clip. (In his 90s, he is battling cancer with amazing personal determination.) This was good to know because the audience has fallen in love with this sprite, lively man.\nThe Washington Post wrote on Monday, \"'Gold Rush' works because it's not about gold, it's about humanity.\" This is so very true. The “Gold Rush” season premiere just can’t get here soon enough.", "external_links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2015/10/12/gold-rush-works-because-its-not-about-gold-its-about-humanity/", "http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/gold-rush/"], "published": "2015-10-12T15:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:00:43.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
