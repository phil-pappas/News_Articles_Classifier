The atmosphere in Hallie Gordon's staging is a skillful blend of grimy proletariat despair and slick multimedia collage, and White's streamlined but sharp text delivers Orwell's dystopian tale with efficiency. But like the besieged citizens of Oceania, this production could use a bit more nuance and breathing room to hit us in the heart as well as the head.\nThe best part by far is the intertwining of Winston Smith's deracinated present with his half-remembered past. Adam Poss' adult Winston is juxtaposed with Matthew Abraham's Young Winston, who appears on video in snippets of scenes with his family that suggest the violence that tore them apart. Given the current flood of images of Syrian refugees fleeing endless warfare in their homeland, it's a powerful choice. It's made even more resonant by having Abraham's Young Winston onstage, looking down upon the adult Winston in his cell after the latter's forbidden romance with Julia (Atra Asdou) has placed the lovers in the clutches of the state. The implication is that when Big Brother isn't watching, we're still judging ourselves through the fractured lens of the past.\nIt's the romance that needs amping up here. Asdou's fiery sensuality should ignite something in Winston that leads to their plans to join the resistance. Which of course may not actually exist in the first place, except as one more trap laid by the totalitarian state to catch those who deviate from the meat-grinder routine of war and propaganda.\nThat love — and their mutual betrayal — is the spine of Orwell's nightmare world. Even if Julia and Winston are more in love with the idea of love (which would be perfectly understandable given how little life offers them), we need to see that they are thoroughly convinced that the risk they're taking is worth it. \"You know they'll get us, don't you?\" Asdou's Julia asks Winston early on. He does — but does he make the leap with her because he wants one last flicker of human connection before the lights go out, or is he hoping to commit suicide by thought-cop? Either is an intriguing possibility, but neither White's script nor Gordon's staging commit one way or another, making it harder for us to invest in the relationship.\nStill, the stifling stark world of Oceania comes through clearly in Collette Pollard's set, studded with filing drawers that serve as literal \"memory holes\" for the past. Joseph A. Burke's projections and Andrew Rovner's soundscape combine distorted \"real\" images from CNN with the eyes of Big Brother (Robert Breuler), the visage of \"revolutionary\" Goldstein (Ian Belknap) (used for the group exercise in \"Two Minutes' Hate\") and Rudy Galvan as a facile newscaster. Though Poss' Winston remains a bit too cipherlike, there are outstanding turns from Lance Baker as his boss/tormentor O'Brien, Manny Buckley as guileless Parsons, betrayed by his own child, and Elizabeth Birnkrant as Syme, Winston's co-worker at the Ministry of Truth and an ardent true believer in the power of words — or, more accurately, the power of erasing words.\nThere is one contemporary nod — all the commuters check their smartphones for messages from the state simultaneously. I suspect that if Orwell were alive today, he'd find that overwhelming the masses with trivia is an even more effective method of mind control than overt propaganda.\nKerry Reid is a freelance critic.\nctc-arts@tribpub.com\n3 STARS\nWhen: Through Nov. 15\nWhere: Steppenwolf Upstairs Theatre, 1650 N.
