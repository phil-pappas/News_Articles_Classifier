Health Minister Satyendar Jain has directed that isolated wards in hospitals must be kept in a state of readiness and number of beds should be doubled than last year, said an official. The health department has already stocked more than one lakh capsules and syrups of Oseltamivir Tamiflu/Fluvir) and, if required, more can be purchased, officials said. Swine flu had assumed epidemic proportions last season which continued till mid-April this year afflicting over 4,259 people and claiming 12 lives in the city. \nModified Date: October 9, 2015 9:05 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:17:08.486+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
