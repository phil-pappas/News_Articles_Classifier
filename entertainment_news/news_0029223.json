Red | Oct. 11, 2015 at 05:50pm \nIf you’re a businessman you could be watching Bloomberg International on your cable TV the whole day waiting for some important news that might dramatically change your business prospects. \nNow, you don’t have to watch news from abroad 24/7 as the Philippines recently got its own Bloomberg TV. \nThe regular broadcasts of Bloomberg TV Philippines (BloombergTVPh), the country’s first 24-hour English business news channel has been on the air since Oct. 5. \nTony Abad, JP Ong \nIt telecasts on the country’s no.1 pay TV service provider, Cignal TV. \nThis collaboration between two of the country’s top media companies, Cignal TV and the News5 together with global media giant Bloomberg Television gives Filipino businessmen the most up-to-date business and economic news and information across the Philippine archipelago. You can watch Bloomber TV Philipppines on Cignal’s Channel 8 (Standard Definition) and Channel 127 (High Definition). Michael Alimurung, Regina Hing Lay \nAccording to Cignal’s Chief Operating Officer Oscar A. Reyes Jr., BloombergTVPh would be available to about 20-million Smartphone users and 30-million Internet users in the country through Bloomberg TV Philippines’ digital platforms. \nAdding punch to BloombergTVPh’s nationwide reach is it’s highly seasoned news anchors and program presenters which are a mix of fresh faces and veteran broadcast journalists with an impressive track record in both media and business. They are solidly backed by Bloomberg Television’s global network of 2, 400 news professionals in 150 bureaus across 73 countries worldwide. Rod Nepomuceno, Jean De Castro \nGet to know more also about the multi-talented hosts of Bloomberg TV Philippines this October as they let the Filipino audience into the intricacies of today’s business and economics. \nMeet BloombergTVPh’s incredible team that includes top-notch entrepreneur and social advocate Quintin Pastrana; seasoned TV correspondent Shawn Yao; finance analyst, management specialist and the team’s Bloomberg Terminal whiz, JP Ong; corporate lawyer and commercial arbitration specialist, Jean de Castro; and veteran international business reporter who came home to join Bloomberg TV Philippines, Regina Lay. Joining them also are the country’s foremost expert on international trade, economist and law professor, Tony Abad; Silicon Valley geek slash marathoner slash social entrepreneur, Michael Alimurung; and marketing whiz and media man, Rod Nepomuceno. Quintin Pastrana, Shawn Yao \nThey face the entertainment press last week most of whom were stunned to face no-showbiz folks and whose language are restricted to market movements, inflation or deflation of economy, lower or higher interest rates, blue chips and so on that most of the writers are not proficient in. \nWhen someone asked what is the channel’s target audience, most of the those at the presidential table said they were aiming to reach the widest audience possible, which means from economic class A to the bottom E. \nIt nearly mortified me as most Filipinos, even those who are micro entrepreneurs are not visibly interested in business news. \nBut, I laud Cignal ang News 5 in bringing Bloomberg TV to the country. At least I have an alternative channel to switch on to if CNN International, BBC World or Al Jazeera, and even CNBC News begin to bore me. \nSaid the guys at the presidential table at Cerchio that Wednesday night, “Bloomberg Television Philippines is a manifestation of the important role that business and finance plays in the country’s development, now and in the future. This 24-hour, 7-day business news channel underscores the economic gains of the country as one of the fastest growing economies in the world today.” \nWell, good luck guys. TV is such a challenging sector in mass communication. For many people, it’s like a bad habit you can’t easily break. But, who knows, you might just find the right mix in programming that would make your channel short of phenomenal. \n\nGet the latest in the world of business with Bloomberg TV Philippines now airing over Cignal TV’s Channel 8 SD; and Channel 127 HD and follow them in their official Facebook page, https://www.facebook.com/BloombergTVPH. \nLucky Christmas with Kapuso Milyonaryo Season 8 \nOver P23 million worth of prizes to be given away to lucky Kapuso viewers. \nAn exciting Christmas season begins today as seasoned actor-comedian and longtime Kapuso Milyonaryo ambassador Joey de Leon, and Pambansang Bae Alden Richards, invite Kapuso viewers nationwide to join the highly successful Network promo, Kapuso Milyonaryo, in its biggest installment to date.
