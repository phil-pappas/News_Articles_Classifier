My character has the right mix of comic and serious elements in it. You are bound to laugh as well as cry with the character. We also had a long chat on the look of the character. There is a surprise element in the film, which I can't disclose now. Kay Kay is a wonderful actor and working with him would be quite an experience. The first schedule starts from October, and I will be out of the town during Durga Puja.\" Said Ankoosh, \"The film is a realistic comedy , which deals with why God is required in our lives. It goes on to ask what the identity of God is, and if he is synonymous with hope and belief. Today , people only remember God in times of need. Bumbada plays the film's sutradhar.\"\nRaima, who worked with Kay Kay in Honeymoon Travels Pvt. Ltd , and with Prosenjit Chatterjee in Chokher Bali and Baishe Srabon , is excited to be a part of this film. \"I am paired opposite Kunaal and I loved him in Delhi Belly . With Bumbada and Kay Kay , it is more of fun than work,\" said Raima.\nThe film will go on the floors from October 15 and will be shot in Mt. Abu and Rajasthan.
