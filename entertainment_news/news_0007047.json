Since 1997, THON has raised more than $127 million for the organization, which helps families of children with pediatric cancer to cover financial costs. The Four Diamonds Fund is also committed to providing money for pediatric cancer research. \nTo learn more about the presentation and for ticketing information, visit Béla Fleck and Abigail Washburn or call 814-863-0255. \nFind the Center for the Performing Arts on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
