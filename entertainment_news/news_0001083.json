Just like the previously-released trailers, the new trailer carries some terrifying elements such as dark shadows, ghosts and a demonic creature named Toby. \"The Ghost Dimension\" follows a family who moves into a new house and finds an old camera which was left behind by the home's previous residents. In the spooky house, their daughter Leila (Ivy George) is haunted by mysterious creatures that can only be seen with the camera. \"I think this camera can see things you can not see with naked eye,\" Ryan (Chris J. Murray) says. The trailer also gives away some never-before-seen footage in which Leila is possessed by a supernatural being. When an exorcist tries to make the evil spirits leave the house, the situation gets worse. The supernatural powers make the wall crumble and open a portal which may lead to the place where the infamous Toby stays. Murray leads the cast which also includes Brit Shaw. Gregory Plotkin serves behind the lens while Jason Blum and Oren Peli produce the movie. The final installment of \" Paranormal Activity \" movie series is slated for a release in U.S. theaters on October 23. TheWrap reported recently that Paramount planned to release the film to VOD just 17 days after it leaves theaters. As a result, some theaters refused to book the film at all. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T08:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:21:54.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
