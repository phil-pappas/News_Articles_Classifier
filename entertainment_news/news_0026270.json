But venues rarely pre­sent art and music together.\nThis fall, Boston museums continue to break with that convention with some revolutionary programming.\nLast week, the Museum of Fine Arts debuted its resident ensemble, Vellumsound. Yes, the museum now has its own ensemble — their next performance is Dec. 4.\n“I’ve been curating concerts here since 2010, and we’ve had a lot of fantastic performers,” said Jasmine Hagans, MFA curator of lectures, concerts and programs. “But what has been missing is that true reason a musical act plays at the MFA. With Vellumsound, we will have a series of performances that can only happen here because the group will help tell the stories of the unique objects in our collection.”\nHagans and violinist Lilit Hartunian went through hundreds of pieces at the MFA to bring to­gether the first multimedia ex­peri­ences. Inspired by stories of the sea, Vellumsound’s first performance paired a string quartet performing Beethoven, Ravel, Vaughan Williams and young Boston composer Robert Honstein with visuals from artists J.M.W. Turner, Canaletto and Chris McCaw. Future events will combine music with dance, poetry and fine art.\n“I’ve done a lot of research, and as far as I can tell, we’re the first museum to have our own ensemble,” Hagans said. “But it makes so much sense to have one bring our collection to life through music. Sometimes visual art and classical music can seem daunting. With Vellumsound, we hope to break down boundaries and get at the universal, humanistic themes of art, make it accessible for everyone.”\nThe Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum has hosted music since its founding in 1903, but it will now dip into modern mainstream music. Co-curated by Boston hip-hop/soul/rock artist Shea Rose, the Rise series brings Malaysian pop star Yuna (Oct. 22) and singer/songwriter Liz Longley (Nov. 19) to the museum’s Calderwood Hall.\n“We named the series Rise for a few different reasons,” Rose said. “If you’ve been in Calderwood Hall, you know the audience is both around you and above you, so an artist needs their music to rise to reach them. But (co-curator) Simone (Scazzocchio) and I also feel like the Gardner is rising to the occasion by bringing diverse music to the space and letting us pair an up-and-coming local act with our national or international headliners.\n“Diversity is definitely a buzz word we’re working off,” Rose added. “We want to engage a diverse, fresh, dynamic demographic from Roxbury and Back Bay, Fenway and the universities, and get the local music scene excited about this.”\nThe concert series continues in 2016 with Feb. 25 and March31 events. The talent will be announced later this fall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:19:51.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
