PICTURE: SUPPLIED Source: News Corp Australia \nFORMER Mareeba boy turned country star 8 Ball Aitken is bringing his Tour In A Million to the Far North with Kuranda, Cairns and Atherton shows. Here, the musician offers a glimpse into his (busy) world. \n8 BALL HAS PLAYED A LOT OF SHOWS OVER THE PAST 12 MONTHS \nThe past year has been a whirlwind of non-stop touring. I have been all over USA and Australia. When I count up my gigs at the end of each year, I can’t believe how many I have done. Highlights have been playing Loretta Lynn’s Ranch and a bunch of festivals in Texas and Florida. My last Australian tour was one notch above sensational too. I still manage to get to every state and territory of Australia each year. \nFAN POWER NOT WIND POWER \nI have been touring long enough that I have friends everywhere. My fans expect me to come back every year on tour to their towns. They let me know on Facebook. I tell them that if they want me then I need some help with promotion. My manager can send them some posters to put up at their local bingo, ice-skating ring, or fish and chips shop. I am harnessing the fan power for my Tour In A Million. I am getting word on the street one fan at a time. \nHE IS A NIGHT OWL \nI wake up early, about 3pm. I immediately have a short back and sides haircut. But by 5pm it has grown right back down to my waist. I shine my shoes, change my guitar strings then go to the airport and check my 300 emails from people wanting meaningful responses. Then I jam all night at a gig and put as many smiles on people’s faces as possible. \nDESPITE LIVING IN NASHVILLE, THERE ARE THINGS 8 BALL MISSES ABOUT FAR NORTH QUEENSLAND (FNQ) \nI miss the laid-back, happy-go-lucky lifestyle sometimes. I really love relaxing at Crystal Cascades. I still have a lot of friends in FNQ. Many from my school days and some old mates from when I worked picking bananas. I also miss my little brother a lot too. He is only in grade three but he knows the words to my songs. On my last FNQ tour he got up on stage with me. He blew the audience away with his vocals. \nPLANS ARE AFOOT TO WRESTLE THE LOCALS WHILE IN FNQ \nI am going to visit my family in Mareeba and also dive into a waterfall somewhere on the Tablelands. I plan to make a smiley face on my breakfast plate made out of tropical fruits. If I get time then I will wrestle some crocs and cassowaries too. I am really looking forward to the gigs. There is nothing like a hometown crowd. \nFANS CAN EXPECT A NEW ALBUM IN 2016 \nI actually had to stop myself from recording another album this year. I have been making one almost ever year for five years ... I have a new manager and new USA album release for 2016. I knew I needed another manager, because I am unmanageable. \nCHECK 8 Ball Aitken performs in Kuranda tonight night, Cairns on Saturday night and Atherton on Sunday night.
