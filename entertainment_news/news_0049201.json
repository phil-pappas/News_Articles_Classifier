Studio Tour in London are \"trying to free\" Dobby the house elf by placing socks outside his glass case.\nA picture posted to the Hogwarts Logic page on Twitter -- and retweeted by series author JK Rowling -- shows the glass case holding one of the puppets that portrayed the house elf in the Harry Potter film series with socks draped over the accompanying plaque.\nFans might remember the scene toward the end of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets when the series' protagonist tricks villain Lucious Malfoy into freeing Dobby by handing him a sock.\nThe film explains a house elf can only be freed from its service if its master gives it a gift of clothing.\nOther Potter fans on Twitter posted more pictures of Dobby's burgeoning sock collection, with user @katiethekools posting a shot of herself leaving one of the socks for the beloved house elf.\nCopyright 2015 by United Press International Share Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1731821", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1731821&h=Harry+Potter+fans+%27trying+to+free%27+Dobby+with+socks+in+London", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1731821&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T12:43:19.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
