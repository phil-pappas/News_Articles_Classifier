But I also hate the Internet because every piece of true pain I've experienced as an adult - with the exception of death in the family and breakups - has come from it. \n\"I've been put to bed for weeks from reading things about myself on sites that used to be considered feminist gospel.\" \nLena, 29, also insisted that her main wish is \"to spread positivity\". \nShe added: \"I know I'm not most moms' idea of a role model, but I try to use the attention that comes with that wisely and not foolishly.\" \nAnd although she has achieved a great deal at a young age, Lena has no fears about getting older. \nTalking about turning 30 next year, she told America's Harper's Bazaar: \"I'm so excited about turning 30. I'm psyched about it because I think that being in your 20s - especially as a woman - there's an inherent tension. Ageism exists in all direction. \n\"I've been really lucky.
