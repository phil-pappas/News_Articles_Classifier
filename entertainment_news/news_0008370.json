Yes, the very chirpy actress, Alia Bhatt herself expressed her interest in the sequel of Dil Chahta Hai flick; if ever made, she wants to work in it with Shraddha Kapoor & Parineeti Chopra .\"Parineeti, Shraddha and I should work in the sequel to â€˜Dil Chahta Hai' as three friends. I think that's a superb idea. It will be so much fun. Should I call Farhan regarding the film, and make it happen?\" Alia Bhatt was quoted as saying to a leading daily. \nWe do agree with you Alia, that it's indeed a mind-blowing idea and we wish sooner or later Farhan considers your amazing cast suggestion for Dil Chahta Hai sequel.
