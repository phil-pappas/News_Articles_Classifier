He said he hadn't performed in two months or walked in a month. \n\"I'm a stand up for y'all. I appreciate y'all for having me,\" he said.

If you really want to do this (stuff), get up, hit up the studio, and do what you do, man. \n\"If you have that talent, put that work in.\" \nThink your friends should see this?
