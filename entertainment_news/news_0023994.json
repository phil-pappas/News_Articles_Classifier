This event is our way of saying ‘thank you’ for their never-ending support,” shares the actor who also co-hosts Sunday PinaSaya. “Kaya mga Kapuso sa Japan, tara na’t makisaya sa amin sa October 11 na po!” \nSantos is likewise excited and thankful as she joins Richards and De las Alas in concert. “It’s always an honor to perform for our countrymen abroad and I am grateful to GMA Pinoy TV for making this possible,” says the award-winning singer-actress who starred in the hit musical Rak of Aegis. “We’ve prepared very special performances, so to all our kababayan in Japan, head over to the New Pier Hall and celebrate with us!” she enthuses. Â \nDe las Alas, who also top billed the concert series’ Vancouver, Anaheim and New York editions, is grateful for the opportunity to entertain Kapuso fans abroad. Her wit and boundless energy are going to make the Philippine Comedy Queen ready to spread the fun to a wider audience. \n“Nagpapasalamat ako sa GMA Pinoy TV dahil napabilang ako sa kanilang 10th year anniversary celebration.
