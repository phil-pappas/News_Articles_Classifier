He was said to be between 5-foot-8 and 5-foot-10 inches tall, weighing about 180 pounds, with short black hair and no visible tattoos or markings on his clothes.\nAnother similar crime is alleged to have taken place Aug. 19 at a Chase Bank ATM in Elgin, according to police. In that case, a man walked up at about 10:30 p.m., pointed a gun at the driver and demanded her ATM card, according to Elgin police.\nPolice said the man withdrew cash from her account before she was able to get away and call police.\nNorthbrook police have asked ATM users to be careful at night, avoiding ATMs that are not well-lit or that are screened from view by landscaping or structures. The police also suggest bringing a friend to keep an eye out. Cards should be ready in advance to make short work of the transaction, and people should count any money later, an e-mailed police warning advised.\nNorthbrook police also advised that ATM users should keep their engine running and the doors locked, with windows closed as much as possible.\n\"If confronted by a robber,\" police said, \"comply with all demands and try to remember any unique identifying characteristics, and call 911.\"\nGlencoe police also sent out a version of the tips to residents in that village.\nileavitt@pioneerlocal.com\nTwitter: @IrvLeavitt\n Elgin", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561ea6c7/turbine/ct-nbs-atm-robbery-tl-1022-20151014"], "published": "2015-10-14T21:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:22:36.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
