That way, when the children grow into adults, they can see all the dreams they had for their future. Huda Ayaz, a seventh grader in Brooklyn, will not need to rely on such an activity. She will simply take a look at the book she published before she even entered high school. Freeze-land is a children’s story that personifies positive and negative thinking through a young girl who helps a snowflake fairy save the secret planet Freeze-land from the evil Ninstragger, who wants to turn the planet dark and evil.\n“When someone thinks positively the environment becomes happy and bright, while negativity makes the environment sad and dark,” Ayaz said.\nAyaz started creating short stories in kindergarten, but she never would have imagined herself being awarded by the borough president for her work. Nonetheless, that is exactly what happened this summer when Eric L. Adams recognized her for her achievement with Freeze-land.\n“I want to inspire other children that they can do whatever they want, without waiting until they become adults to accomplish their life goals,” Ayaz said.\n //www.ayazsisters.com .\nFreeze-land\nBy Huda Ayaz\nISBN: 9781480802698\n Amazon, Barnes & Noble and Archway Publishing\nAbout the author\nHuda Ayaz is a seventh grader in Brooklyn, New York, who has been honored for her writing by Borough President Eric L.
