The scenes will play in “big, long, cool, unblinking takes” to further take advantage of the scope of a 70mm projection, Tarantino said.\nUSA TODAY\n'Hateful Eight' gets special Christmas release\nThe Weinstein Co. is planning to install roadshow projectors in 100 theaters across the country. Previous films that were released in a 70mm print, such as Interstellar and The Master , only made 12 and 16 prints, respectively.\nBut that doesn't mean that folks who are seeing the multiplex version will be getting shortchanged. The scenes are slightly altered in the theatrical cut to make it easier to view in both the theater and on TV.\nThe 70 is the 70,” Tarantino said. “You’ve paid the money. You’ve bought your ticket. So you’re there. I’ve got you. But I actually changed the cutting slightly for a couple of the multiplex scenes because it’s not that. Now it’s on Showtime Extreme. You’re watching it on TV and you just kind of want to watch a movie on your couch. Or you’re at Hot Dog on a Stick and you just want to catch a movie.\"\nHateful Eight will be released in theaters Dec. 25, 2015.\n5 CONNECT 18 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1REQMmp TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1REQMmp&text=Quentin%20Tarantino%20to%20show%20two%20different%20versions%20of%20%27Hateful%20Eight%27&via=usatoday", "http://usat.ly/1REQMmp", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635803299387901680-XXX-THE-HATEFUL-EIGHT-75216384.JPG", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1REQMmp&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e47265371f176e1ca60045acf5227a963f0f1c0e/c=500-0-2500-2000/local/-/media/2015/06/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/635697121406162037-GTY-452809058-66123970.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dc4ca059458e6f05b495b43df5fbdde780e05604/c=68-0-1132-800&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635803299387901680-XXX-THE-HATEFUL-EIGHT-75216384.JPG", "https://variety.com/2015/film/in-contention/quentin-tarantino-hateful-eight-roadshow-multiplex-70mm-1201615357/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635803299387901680-XXX-THE-HATEFUL-EIGHT-75216384.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-13T19:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:53:55.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
