The Bangalore-based IT major surprised the Street for the second time, delivering a strong set of numbers in all parameters, with profit, sales and dollar revenues beating expectations. (Read: FPI framework to alleviate hot money outflows issues: Report) But a downward revision in its dollar revenue guidance for the fiscal dampened mood, triggering a fresh bout of sell-off. Taking advantage of an early momentum on the back of highly positive Asian cues, the key indices reclaimed the significant 8,200 mark and also reacted to the strong set of Infosys numbers. However, a sudden reversal of sentiment following the lower guidance and caution ahead of CPI inflation and IIP later in the day dragged the bourses into the red. The country’s second-largest software services firm posted a 9.8 per cent increase in consolidated net profit at Rs 3,398 crore for the quarter ended September. Meanwhile, most Asian markets ended firmly higher, led by a rally in Shanghai equities driven by prospects of more stimulus from the Chinese government. Japan remained closed and will resume trade tomorrow. As the earnings season just got off to a tepid start, volatility is likely to persist in the market as investors are now positioning themselves for corporate earnings visibility, which will gather steam next week. Any healthy surprises and optimistic guidance will boost investor confidence, a trader said. The 50-share broader index opened higher at 8,231.50 and fluctuated between 8,244.50 and 8,128.20 before ending at 8,143.60, down 46.10 points, or 0.56 per cent. Sectorally, IT took the maximum knock, down 1.50 pct, spooked by a sell-off in heavyweight Infosys and other major technology stocks. It was followed by healthcare, FMCG and banking. However, a sharp rebound in commodities worldwide helped metal indices rally by 1.95 per cent along with infra, auto and energy-related sectors. The biggest losers included HDFC, TCS, ITC, Sun Pharma, Lupin and HDFC Bank. Turnover in the cash segment fell to Rs 14,482.56 crore against Rs 16,134.02 crore last Friday. A total of 8,891.09 lakh shares changed hands in 65,42,496 trades and the market capitalisation of NSE stood at Rs 97,15,461 crore. \n  8:10 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:59:09.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
