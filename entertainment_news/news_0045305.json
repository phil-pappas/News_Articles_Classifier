It's a remarkable achievement.Ryan McCaffrey - IGN\"The track list that comes on the Rock Band 4 disc is a little light on memorable songs, but thanks to admirable backward compatibility with a huge DLC catalogue, Rock Band 4 remains every bit the magical cooperative gaming experience the series has always been. Getting a band together in the living room to rock out creates some incredible moments of musical joy.\"On top of that, a new career mode injects some fun personality and decision-making, while solos let you express yourself mid-song without penalty. Rock Band still fulfils its potential to make me feel like a superstar musician and, like 65-year-old Bruce Springsteen still doing killer three-hour shows, proves that it's still got 'it'.\" © Harmonix Chris Carter - Destructoid\"Rock Band 4 is a bit of a conundrum. On one hand, it's not only a hassle to switch generations due to the fact that so many elements don't work with the new one, but additionally - Rock Band 3 is still a thing, supports all of your DLC, and has more features.\"On the other, there's nothing inherently wrong with this iteration, and for those of you who missed out in the past or have broken 360s or PS3s, you'll still be able to rock out into the night with friends and have a whole lot of fun.\"Scott Butterworth - GameSpot\"Backwards-compatibility would make Rock Band 4 more accessible and appealing, but if you sold off all your instruments years ago, don't worry: the new gear works just fine. Every now and then the game failed to register a note I swear I hit, but it wasn't frequent or consistent enough to really raise any red flags.\"Rock Band 4 recaptures the unadulterated gratification that made the series such a hit half a decade ago, but mainly because it's a relatively unchanged, repackaged Rock Band 2. A lack of content and general stagnation hold this particular iteration of Rock Band back, but new ideas like Freestyle Solos genuinely enhance the core experience, which remains a sincere and joyful celebration of music.\" function onTemplateLoaded(experienceID) { bcExp = brightcove.getExperience(experienceID); modVP = bcExp.getModule(APIModules.VIDEO_PLAYER); modExp = bcExp.getModule(APIModules.EXPERIENCE); modCon = bcExp.getModule(APIModules.CONTENT); modVP.addEventListener(BCMediaEvent.BEGIN, onVideoStart); modVP.addEventListener(BCMediaEvent.STOP, onVideoStop); modVP.addEventListener(BCMediaEvent.PROGRESS, onVideoProgress); } #_containermyExperience4095401561001 { height: 100%; } // InSkin integration parameters: InSkinParams['myInSkin14095401561001'] = { 'srv_SectionID': '', 'srv_SectionIDPlay': '123757', 'srv_Keywords': '', 'plr_ContentID': 'myExperience4095401561001', 'plr_ContentType': 'BRIGHTCOVE3', 'plr_ContentW': 558, 'plr_ContentH': 314, 'plr_NoSkinContentResize': true, 'plr_NoSkinContentW': 618, 'plr_NoSkinContentH': 348, 'plr_NoSkinInSkinResize': true, 'plr_NoSkinInSkinW': 618, 'plr_NoSkinInSkinH': 348, 'plr_ResizeOnHideSkin': true, 'plr_HideSkinOnExternalAd': 'all', 'plr_ShowSkinAfterExternalAd': true, 'cnt_SmartPlayer': true }; // create the InSkin object: var InSkinObject4095401561001 = new InSkin.Base('myInSkin14095401561001'); brightcove.createExperiences(); if (!navigator.userAgent.match(/Android/i)) { InSkinObject4095401561001.init(); ai_type=\"video\"; } Keza MacDonald - Kotaku\"Rock Band 4 does not exactly revolutionise the music genre. Instead of going with a new direction - like the forthcoming Guitar Hero Live, with its new mechanic, new point-of-view stage shows and new business model - it is resurrecting and refining. But Rock Band 4 didn't need revolutionising.\"We're in a different era now, and the way we listen to and enjoy music across all media has changed massively since Rock Band was last with us, but the innate, human appeal of playing music with your friends has not faded at all. There's a lot of power in rock music, and Rock Band harnesses it to make you feel like a god.\"Matt Miller - Game Informer\"In this year's music-game scene, Rock Band 4 offers tried-and-true polish, and an impressive opportunity for backward compatibility.\"Whether you're importing a back catalogue or not, the new title stands on its own with smart music selections, and skill-based gameplay refined over years of experimentation. After a few years away, I'd almost forgotten how fun the Rock Band experience can be.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:12:00.746+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
