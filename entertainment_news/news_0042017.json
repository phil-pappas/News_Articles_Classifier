At the same time, he insisted that “consultations with Kashmiris, who are an integral part of the dispute, are essential to evolving a peaceful solution.” \nContending that normalisation of relations with India has been his priority since he came to office, the Pakistan Prime Minister said the two countries “should address and resolve the causes of tension” and take all possible measures to avert further escalation. ”That is why I want to use the opportunity today to propose a new peace initiative with India, starting with measures that are the simplest to implement: ”One, we propose that Pakistan and India formalize and respect the 2003 understanding for a complete ceasefire on the Line of Control in Kashmir. For this purpose, we call for UNMOGIP?s expansion to monitor the observance of the ceasefire. \n“Two, we propose, that Pakistan and India reaffirm that they will not resort to the use or the threat of use of force under any circumstances. This is a central element of the UN Charter. ”Three, steps be taken to demilitarize Kashmir. Four, agree to an unconditional mutual withdrawal from Siachen Glacier, the world?s highest battleground,” he said. \nModified Date: October 1, 2015 12:43 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T22:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:24:10.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
