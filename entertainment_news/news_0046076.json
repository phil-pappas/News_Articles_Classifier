(Photo: Special to the News Journal) \nWhen Boz Scaggs was 14 years old, he watched a life-changing concert. \nHe was a “little country boy” that never dreamed of being a musician. He loved being outdoors. Playing in the woods was a gift and music was the next greatest pleasure. He started playing cello when he was 8 years old, and even started taking lessons. But when his family moved, he had to give it up. \nScaggs’ family bounced around rural towns up and down Oklahoma and Texas for most of his childhood. \n“I was in a little town in first grade, another town in second grade, another town in third grade and another town in fourth grade,” he said. The schools changed but music always followed. Nov. 6 show raises funds for Larry Butler Scholarship \nThe magic of radio and the mystery of records revealed sounds that he wanted to learn. He picked up the guitar and started playing along. Every song was a lesson. \nHe continued playing, but found a new teacher: The sounds of New Orleans. Miles away from Louisiana, he dialed into the radio stations of the Big Easy. He listened to music that would influence his life. He turned on to blues, jazz and rock ‘n’ roll, but no radio station or record could prepare him for the next lesson. Nothing compared to live music and his teenage world shook when he watched a legend onstage. \nEverything changed as Ray Charles played. \n“That rewired my whole system,” he said. \nScaggs played and traveled. In the late ‘60s, he joined a friend from prep school and started playing gigs in San Francisco. He recorded two albums with the Steve Miller Band, then went solo. It took almost a decade to break big with “Silk Designs” in 1976. The album included his hit single, “Lowdown,” which won a Grammy Award for Best R&B Song. \nHis latest album, “A Fool To Care,” pays tribute to the soul music that he listened to and learned from. He never dreamed of a music career, but Scaggs has created a lifetime of work enjoyed by millions. \n“It didn’t occur to me for quite a long time that I was going to be a musician,” he said. “It was just what I loved to do.” \nWant to go? \n• WHAT : Boz Scaggs in concert. \n• WHEN : 7:30 p.m. Saturday. \n• WHERE : Saenger Theatre 118 Palafox Place. \n• TICKETS : $50 to $60, available at the Saenger Theatre box office, Ticketmaster outlets, Ticketmaster.com or bu phone at 800-745-3000.
