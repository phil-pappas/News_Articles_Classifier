Wake up and smell the peanut butter, America!\nThree Massachusetts foodies have added the kick of two cups of coffee into every serving of the beloved nut spread.\nKeith Barnofski, Andrew Brach and Chris Pettazzoni said they were searching for a hangover cure when they mixed green-coffee extract and natural agave sweetener into peanut butter.\n“We wanted to come up with something that was useful, something that we wanted,” Barnofski told the Daily News. “Nobody has the best way to cure a hangover, and a lot of people end up automatically going to something unhealthy.”\nThe company claims its STEEM peanut butter makes the best use of caffeine by turning it into a solid food.\n“You can have the same amount of caffeine that would normally make you jittery, but you’re not going to feel that because it won’t hit you all at once,” Barnofski said. “In an energy drink, a lot of (the caffeine) just goes right through you.”\nCourtesy of Keith Barnofski The caffeine from green-coffee extract bonds to the unsaturated fat in the peanut butter for a natural digestion that lasts longer than coffee or an energy drink. The proof, of course, is in this particular pudding. Barnofski said that creating a buzz-worthy peanut butter was useless if it didn’t taste good.\n“If we sold peanut butter that didn’t look and taste exactly like peanut butter, people wouldn’t want it,” he said.\nSTEEM peanut butter is available only in 14 stores in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, but the owners hope to expand production soon.\nIt is also available online at www.steempb.com for $4.99 per 8 oz. jar, roughly two-and-a-half times the price of other natural peanut butters.\nkfeldman@nydailynews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:05:26.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
