Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later on July 21. Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less. The third member of the mission, Michael Collins, piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to Earth.\nDuncan Miller Gallery will display and offer a rare set of original NASA photographs of the Apollo 11 mission from November 7 - December 5, 2015.\nSee the Facebook invitation to the opening reception here: https://www.facebook.com/events/957388484333171/\nDuncan Miller Gallery specializes in presenting fine art photography through its gallery and special project http://YourDailyPhotograph.com\nDuncan Miller Gallery, 2525 Michigan Ave #A7, Santa Monica CA 90404", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/events/957388484333171/", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZmFjZWJvb2suY29tL2V2ZW50cy85NTczODg0ODQzMzMxNzEv", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL1lvdXJEYWlseVBob3RvZ3JhcGguY29t"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:15:26.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
