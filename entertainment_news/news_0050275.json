Special to Newsday \nadvertisement | advertise on newsday \nNBC weather forecaster Al Roker has apologized for what he characterized as an \"insensitive\" Twitter image showing himself and two others smiling in a selfie against the backdrop of storm-related destruction in South Carolina -- including a car resting within a collapsed roadway. \n\"Absolutely correct,\" Roker, 61, tweeted in response to social media posts taking him to task for the since-deleted image, which he had captioned, \"My crew and I getting ready to report on East Coast flooding from S. Carolina on @NBCNightlyNews with Kate Snow.\" \nadvertisement | advertise on newsday \n\"I apologize for being insensitive,\" he went on. \"The woman in that car got out without injury. We should not have been in the picture. We came down to report and I offended those who lost so much. I am sorry.\" Photos 'Today' show through the years \nTo a subsequent Twitter commenter who wrote he had done nothing wrong, saying, \"People are just too touchy nowadays!!,\" Roker responded, \"Nope. I should know better. Got caught up in a moment of camaraderie without thinking about surroundings. It's my mistake.\" \nComing soon: Newsday's Entertainment newsletter, for the latest on celebs, TV, more.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T22:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:59:08.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
