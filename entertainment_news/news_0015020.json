And his Sandalwood debut has him composing for Shivarajkumar's Santeyalli Ninta Kabeera. The film has some interesting tunes, in which there are some Kabir dohas that have been tuned into tracks too. When we caught up with Ismail when he was in town, he chose to keep it short and suspense-filled. \"This is going to be a treat. I am enjoying every bit and trust me when I say that what everyone is going to get is magical. There couldn't have been a better film for me to do as my first Kannada project,\" he added. This film is based on the Hindi play Kabeer Khada Bazaar Mein, and is Shivarajkumar's second historical role. The film has Malayalam actress Sanusha playing the heroine. The film also has Sarath Kumar and Om Puri. Sanjjanaa has done a cameo too.
