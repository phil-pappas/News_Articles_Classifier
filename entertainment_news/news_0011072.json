There's also a men's line, FL2. \nThe 36-year-old mother of two stays fit by doing a variety of cardio and yoga. \n\"It just depends on if I have time to workout and what my mood is,\" she told Harper's Bazaar earlier this year. \"Like sometimes, I'll just want to stretch and do more of a hot yoga-type situation, sometimes I want to sweat it out and do more cardio, spinning. But my go-to's are Brazilian Butt Lifts -- it's just really, really concentrating on your core and your butt -- and Pilates.\" \nCopyright Â© 2015,  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:34:59.526+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
