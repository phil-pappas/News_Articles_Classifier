NASA estimates the shape spans 150 light years, but is caused by a dense neutron star that's just 12 miles in diameter.\n\"The pulsar is a rapidly spinning neutron star which is spewing energy out into the space around it to create complex and intriguing structures, including one that resembles a large cosmic hand,\" NASA said in a release.\nThat energy makes B1509 \"one of the most powerful electromagnetic generators in the Galaxy,\" said NASA, with a magnetic field at it's surface that's 15 trillion times stronger than that of Earth's.\nAstronomers believe B1509 is roughly 1,700 years old and is located 17,000 light years from Earth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:04:37.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
