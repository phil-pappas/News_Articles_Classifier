Shirley Jr. rode his mighty Schwinn Stingray to deliver The Palm Beach Times in Pahokee from 1965 through 1966 when he was 11 and 12.\n“Back then, the Times did not publish a weekend paper, but was delivered on Saturday and Sunday as The Palm Beach Post-Times. The Saturday paper was delivered in the afternoon, as through the week, but the Sunday paper had to be delivered before sunrise, which meant for me, getting up betwixt the hours of 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. to get to where the papers were delivered for distribution. Here I was, 11 years old, getting up all by myself, riding my bicycle to my destination in the dark of early morning. Whether rain, fog, cold or hot, the paper was delivered.”\nWhat’s your Post paperboy story?
