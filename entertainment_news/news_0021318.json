(Photo: Alex Bailey)\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE In Burnt (in theaters Oct. 30), Bradley Cooper plays a hotheaded chef determined to earn his third Michelin star, aided by an accomplished sous chef (and sauce wizard) portrayed by Sienna Miller. In real life, Cooper and Miller are coming off a dynamic year in their careers, launched by record-setting hit American Sniper ($350 million at the box office) and the PTSD drama's subsequent trip to the Oscars. So what's their secret ingredient to a savvy career in showbiz? USA TODAY goes truffle hunting for advice with the friendly stars.\n1. Choose your \"work husbands\" and \"work wives\" wisely\nBetween Sniper and Burnt , Cooper and Miller basically embarked on a year of acting camp together. \"We really did,\" he says. \"It was like one non-stop thing. I begged (Sienna) to do Burnt . I knew I had to do it, but her deal didn't really close until after Sniper. But she was game for talking about it.\"\n'Burnt' stars Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller talk home cooking, TV food competitions and last meals. Dan MacMedan\n2. Hit the stage\nCooper and Miller both braved the stage in the past year. Cooper brought his Broadway revival of The Elephant Man to London and earned raves, and Miller took over for Emma Stone as Sally Bowles in Broadway's Cabaret . \"Every time I see someone I care about on stage, before it starts, I'm like 'Oh, God, please, please, please (let it go well).' But the second I saw him onstage, I completely forgot who I was looking at,\" she says of Cooper's disfigured character, played without prosthetics. \"It's a testament to him, but you can't believe that's the guy who played Chris Kyle.\"\nUSA TODAY\nBradley Cooper, Sienna Miller heat up 'Burnt'\n3. Diversify\nMiller has boosted her résumé with smaller roles in critical hits such as Foxcatcher and Sniper, and Ben Affleck's upcoming Prohibition drama, Live By Night (2017), is waiting in the wings. \"As a woman, you have to start being really careful and clever about the choices you make if you want to have longevity,\" says Miller, adding that she now has \"a much clearer sense of the kind of stuff I want to do and there's relief in that.\"\nBradley Cooper plays a top chef who let bad behavior destroy his career. With help, he cleans up and returns to London determined to redeem himself. VPC\nCooper continues to expand his portfolio as an executive producer (and occasional guest star) on CBS' new drama Limitless , based on his hit 2011 film. \"I have big dreams. I always have. So I'm always sort of looking on to the next thing,\" says Cooper, who will take on A Star is Born for his directorial debut, whenever it happens. Despite reports that Beyoncé has been approached to play the role Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand made famous, there's \"no update\" on the project, he says.\n4. Demand your worth\nJennifer Lawrence just made headlines writing an essay for Lena Dunham's Lenny newsletter about earning less on American Hustle than her male co-stars. Cooper, who starred with Lawrence in Hustle , calls her platform and influence \"monumental.\" He takes it a step further, adding that \"Amy Adams was the one who really got shafted because she worked every day on ( American Hustle ) and got paid less than anybody.\"\nSienna Miller plays sous chef Helene in 'Burnt.' (Photo: Alex Bailey)\nMiller recently revealed that she walked away from a Broadway gig after finding out she wouldn't be paid \"within 100 miles\" of what her male co-star was being offered. \"At that point, you can either swallow it and do the passion project, or you can say, 'Well, you know what, I'm going to walk in there feeling insecure and undermined and then I'm going to have to try and be creative?' I feel like I've had that many, many times in my life, and I couldn't figure out why I didn't feel good in the (job), and it's because people aren't valuing you or respecting you in the way you deserve to be respected. And I'm pretty sure that if it was two men (negotiating), that wouldn't have happened.\"\nMiller has a 3-year-old daughter, Marlowe, with her former fiancé Tom Sturridge. \"I hope by the time she's at an age where she is earning money and on her own that the world will be different,\" she says. \"And I do feel like there are a lot of women who are fighting for that change.\"\nUSA TODAY\nBradley Cooper shoots, scores in 'American Sniper'\n5. Adjust your expectations\nSniper was supposed to come out Christmas 2015, but with Oscar in its sights, the Iraq War drama was rushed into theaters ahead of last year's awards season. This year finds Cooper back-to-back in theaters with David O. Russell's Joy , a story starring Lawrence as a matriarch who founds a business dynasty, in theaters Christmas Day. It's Cooper's third film with Russell, who directed him in Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle . Cooper is one of few who has seen Joy . \" I love it,\" he says. \"I think it's pretty incredible.\"\nBradley Cooper and Sienna Miller, who last starred together in 'American Sniper,' photographed Nov. 17, 2014, at Locanda Verde restaurant at the Greenwich Hotel in New York.
