Titled “35+ The KUHL Event,” the show will also feature Gary Valenciano, Regine Velasquez-Alcasid, Jaya, Tirso Cruz III, Isabella and Venezuelan actor Fernando Carillo. \nFor tickets, call 5310688 or 0917-8139065. \nExcerpts from our interview with Kuh: \nWhat would you say were your career highs and lows? \nMounting a concert is always a high for me—a creative crunch… It’s exciting because I get to work with some of the best minds in the business and, as a bonus, they become my friends. The lows aren’t memorable for me, so I don’t have much recollection. \nWhat kind of repertoire will you be doing in the show? Will there be worship songs given the venue? \nIt will be composed of my hits mixed with some of my new inspirational pop songs and some gospel songs. I chose that venue because it’s time to give back glory where glory is due… The auditorium is equipped with state-of-the-art light and sound systems… And I feel at home there. \nWhat’s it like sharing the stage with your daughter Isabella? \nIt’s always a great pleasure and I’m so proud of how dedicated she is in giving excellent performances. I get kilig when people who’ve watched her say she’s so good. \nFernando Carillo is kind of unexpected. \nWe met the last time he was here through my agent Arnold Vegafria. I found out that he is a Christian and I invited him. \nIt’s good to have someone unexpected, especially since I’ve been in this business so long. \nDo you wish to pursue more acting projects? \nYes, definitely more acting. I also want to do more inspirational albums and mount musical conferences, which begin with an inspirational talk and end with a concert. I love doing events that could spark change in a person’s life. I’ve learned so much and it would be a waste if I don’t pass it on. \nRELATED STORIES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:02:59.138+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
