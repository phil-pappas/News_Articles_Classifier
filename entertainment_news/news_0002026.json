There evidently was a note found. There were pills located near her... but the final cause of death won't be released until we get full toxicology and tests back.\" \nOn Tuesday, Carrey paid tribute to his ex, stating he was \"deeply saddened by the passing of my sweet Cathriona.\" \nHe added, \"She was a truly kind and delicate Irish flower, too sensitive for this soil, to whom loving and being loved was all that sparkled. My heart goes out to her family and friends and to everyone who loved and cared about her.\" \nHer family has also issued an emotional statement to the Irish Independent. It reads: \"The family of Cathriona White sincerely regret the untimely passing of their beloved daughter and sister. \n\"Cathriona was a shining light in our lives who was loved deeply by her entire family. We will miss her terribly and at this difficult time we ask to be left in private to mourn our loss. There will be no further statements on behalf of the family.\" \nThe Irish-born make-up artist was 30. She and Carrey had been dating on and off since 2012.
