More importantly, ticket sales for showings of the film opened, allowing fans to rest easy knowing that they'll be able to see the movie as soon as it hits screens in December. \nThe trailer gives us a more substantial look at the film's new leading characters, Rey and Finn, than we've had before, and it also gives us a generous peek at the Vader-esque villain, Kylo Ren. Of course, it also toys with our nostalgia by sprinkling Han Solo, Chewbacca and the Millennium Falcon throughout. We even get glimpses of Princess Leia, R2-D2 and (maybe) Luke Skywalker. Throw in lots of action shots of TIE fighters, X-wings and other battling spacecraft, and you've got triggers galore for major excitement from fanatics. \nThe trailer debuted during Monday Night Football on ESPN, and before the night was over, social media lit up with discussion and debate about the still mostly mysterious storyline of the upcoming film. The trailer also sparked a stampede to ticket sites, where tickets to the first showings of the film, still nearly two months away, went on sale. Chances are, if you live in a major metropolitan area and didn't buy your tickets on Monday, you've already missed your chance to see the movie on opening day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T14:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:38:55.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
