The setback snapped their nine-game winning streak dating back to Sept. 27.\n\"I leave it up to you guys to debate the strike zone,\" said catcher David Ross, who was displeased with Cuzzi after a called third strike on him in the sixth. \"But (Lackey) executed. He was ahead all night. He didn't throw many pitches. We struggled to solve him.\nPhotos from Game 1 of the National League Division Series between the Cubs and the Cardinals.\n\"It's one game. Hopefully we have four more, but they beat us.\"\nThanks to the masterful pitching of Lackey, the Cubs will look for more creative ways to even the series Saturday before returning to Wrigley Field with ace Jake Arrieta lined up to pitch Game 3 on Monday.\nOther than imagining where Cuzzi's strike zone actually was, the Cubs' offensive creativity was limited to slugger Kyle Schwarber opening the seventh with a bunt single.\nBut the rally ended quickly when Lackey, who pitched 71/3 innings of two-hit ball, struck out Kris Bryant and induced Anthony Rizzo to ground into a double play.\nOne pitch before Rizzo's double play, the Cubs asked Cuzzi to inspect the ball. But the Cubs, who led the NL with 567 walks during the regular season, remained mystified by the boundaries Cuzzi set for Lackey's strike zone.\n\"Sometimes (umpires) are good, sometimes they're not,\" Ross said. \"But I know they're doing the best they can and don't want to mess up. To blame it on the umpires is the direction I'm not going to take.\"\nThe Cardinals' outfielders recorded only two putouts during the first five innings as Lackey held the Cubs hitless. Addison Russell ended Lackey's no-hit bid with a single up the middle in the sixth and then stole second and advanced to third on a groundout. Dexter Fowler then hit a fly deep to right field with two outs that had Cardinals fans gasping.\nBut Randal Grichuk made the catch in front of the wall to preserve the Cardinals' 1-0 lead.\n\"I've hit a lot worse (balls) that went out here,\" Fowler said.\nUnfortunately for Lester, a Stephen Piscotty double and Matt Holliday RBI single in the first was all Lackey needed.\nThe Cardinals, who appeared invigorated after a four-day layoff following their third consecutive NL Central title, pulled away in the eighth on homers from pinch-hitter Tommy Pham and Piscotty.\n\"It isn't a matter if you're us, the Pirates, Dodgers, Mets or anyone else,\" said Lester, who struck out nine in his 71/3 innings. \"(The path to the World Series) has gone through this city for a long time.\n\"You look up at the (11 world championship) banners in right-center field, you know that. It's like looking up at Yankee Stadium. You know you have to go through those guys to get to where you want to go.\"\nmgonzales@tribpub.com\nTwitter @MDGonzales\nPrivacy Policy Major League Baseball Baseball Chicago Cubs St. Louis Cardinals Anthony Rizzo National League David Ross", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "https://twitter.com/MDGonzales", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56187d51/turbine/ct-cubs-cardinals-game-1-photos-20151009-070", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561890bd/turbine/ct-expanded-strike-zone-report-cubs-cardinals-spt-1010-20151009", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56187d4e/turbine/ct-cubs-cardinals-game-1-photos-20151009-071", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561908c4/turbine/ct-cubs-cardinals-game-1-photos-20151009"], "published": "2015-10-10T07:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T15:55:16.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
