Attendees will learn about Delluva’s inspiration and imagery, as well as the print process she uses to create her works. The gallery talk, demonstration and workshop will start at 1:30 p.m. on Monday, Oct. 26, at Penn State Lehigh Valley, starting in the Ronald K. De Long Gallery then moving to Room 303. \nOther printmakers featured in the current exhibit include: Ron De Long’s assemblage installation of an armada of model sailboats; Lucy Gans, who utilizes photogravure, lithography and letter press; Richard Redd’s collagraphs, which recreate fairytales; and Evan Summer’s etchings of architectural landscapes. This exhibit runs until Dec. 12. \nThe exhibit, gallery talk and demonstration are all free and open to the public. The hands-on workshop is also free but requires registration by Oct. 19 due to limited studio space.
