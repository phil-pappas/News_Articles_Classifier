Union Street brewery. Cook said this new double dry-hopped version of Badass was outstanding. It's currently clarifying and carbing up in the Brite tank (and should be kegged and on draft very, very soon), but Mesrobian was nice enough to give me a little sneak preview. Let me put this succinctly: Whoa. Good job, good effort, Roc Brewing. This beer ruled. Roc's IPAs have always steered toward the classic East Coast definition of the style with a bigger malt backbone. (Which is in stark contrast to the Vermont-style IPAs that are almost non-existent in the malt department to let the hops sing. Or the traditional West Coast style such as IPAs from Stone or Green Flash that wallop you in the mouth with hop bite/overload.)\nThis new iteration of Badass is super floral and super citrusy. But it remains super balanced and well supported by a good dose of malt. That provides a good amount of malt sweetness to nicely contrast the hop bite. The future is bright at Roc.\nI also got to try the new version of the Whoopass DIPA and Roc's new Lagerithm. The easy-drinking lager, closer to a lighter fest beer, is Roc's first lager (and is still fermenting).\nWCLEVELAND@Gannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T06:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:03:18.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
