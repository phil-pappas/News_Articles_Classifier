First, the bad news. On the first day of the drive, held at St. Paul's Church, my iron readings were too low, and I was not allowed to donate.\nThe GOOD news is that I had to try again on the second day of the drive, at the Webster Recreation Center. What was awesome about that was that members of the Women's Club of Webster were volunteering at the canteen table, and had baked dozens upon dozens of homemade cookies for post-donation snacking.\nNow, I always enjoy the packaged cookies the Red Cross normally provides at the canteen, but having plates overflowing with home-baked cookies was a bonus. I even snatched one (an oatmeal scotchie) while I was waiting to be escorted into my private health history cubicle.\nThis is the first year the Women's Club of Webster has helped out with the Community Blood Drive. Liz Baker, the club's chairman, told me that 14 members worked three shifts to staff the tables, and 13 members (many of them the same women) baked cookies. They were each asked to make two or three dozen, but most of them made more than that, Liz said.\nSo, do the math. These ladies provided close to 500 cookies for Thursday's donation drive.\nWow. I sure hope they decide to help out again next year.\nAs it turned out, my iron levels refused to cooperate once again, and I was deferred a second time. But that didn't stop me from heading back to the canteen to have some cookies. By the time I was done chatting with the ladies and the other donors and taking photos, I might have had four or five more oatmeal scotchies. (I say \"might have\" because I truly lost count.)\nThank you to the Women's Club of Webster for helping out and for all the things you do to support our community. And especially thank you to all the donors who took the time to attend the blood drive. You are all heroes.\nFor more information about the Women's Club of Webster, contact Sharon Nairy at 671-2258.\n* * *\nemail me at missyblog@gmail.com\n\"Like\" this blog on Facebook and follow me on Twitter", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/dluMG1", "https://twitter.com/Missyblog"], "published": "2015-10-16T02:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:05:34.911+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
