Getting this message across perfectly, in the form of an enjoyable yet tense survival tale, is Ridley Scott’s newest film The Martian . A sci-fi tale based on a book of the same name, the movie should do wonders for increasing applications for jobs at [entity display=\"NASA\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"nasa\" natural_id=\"fred/company/102607\"]NASA[/entity] (for astronauts and for engineers/designers at Jet Propulsion Lab, since everyone gets some glory here), not to mention working a little early magic on October’s [entity display=\"box\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"box\" natural_id=\"fred/company/102487\"]box[/entity] office. Driven not only by its engrossing concept and sure to be Oscar-nominated visual effects, but also by wonderful performances and a great script, it's another of the top year-end contenders for Best Picture.\nThe Martian is a big-budget space movie with several major stars — including Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, and Chiwetel Ejiofor — releasing on a weekend with no other new competition (particularly of a similar sort regarding genre, tone, and style), so it should open pretty well. Good reviews will assist it further (it's currently enjoying a Rotten Tomato score above 90%), as well the inevitable positive audience scores and word of mouth, because it’s a great picture (more on that in a moment, though). Fandango tracking has it as the leader in advance ticket sales for the weekend by a large margin (with a score of 90 out of 100 on their Fanticipation scale), and early predictions estimate an opening domestic weekend in the $40-45 million range.\nBy way of comparison, Gravity opened to nearly $56 million in North America two years ago on the same early October weekend, and last year Interstellar took $47 million at the domestic box office on its freshman weekend. Gravity , though, enjoyed tremendous buzz and near-frenzied levels of anticipation after smart marketing that released extended scenes from the movie to demonstrate how fantastic the visual effects looked and highlighted the use of long, uncut shots. Plus, the mix of sci-fi and disaster is typically a potent recipe for financial success in films. Sandra Bullock ’s popularity with audiences, as well as her Oscar-winner clout, and the supporting performance of George Clooney all contributed to further enhancing Gravity’s box office performance. IMAX ticket sales also boosted it significantly, something The Martian will lack.\nInterstellar , meanwhile, had the Christopher Nolan brand name, which spells immediate blockbuster status. It also had a lot of advance buzz about the scientific concepts involved in the story, and its first-ever realistic portrayal of black holes and worm holes on the big screen. Add the star power of Oscar winners Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway, and the big opening and overall strong global box office receipts for Interstellar were a given.\nThe Martian is based on a best selling novel that enjoyed a great deal of attention in the lead-up to the film’s release, too. It became a best seller and one of the must-reads of 2014. So that could be a good sign for the film adaptation. All of this, plus the aforementioned casting, genres, and timing of release mean The Martian should easily hit the expected opening numbers.\nOverseas, it should also enjoy good returns, for the same reasons. It’s the Asian marketplace where it will perform best overseas, I imagine, especially in China. Besides the simple fact China is now the most important foreign market by sheer force of its size and consumer base, The Martian has a China-related subplot and other elements I won’t mention, which will no doubt feature significantly in the international marketing to boost interest.\nWhether it can perform to blockbuster numbers remains to be seen, but it has all of the ingredients to be as big as Gravity or Interstellar , and it certainly deserve to be in light of how good and entertaining it is. So a domestic opening likely north of $40 million and a final worldwide tally somewhere around $500 million looks to be in the cards, if things go as well as it seems like they could. However, i t faces Pan on the second weekend of release, and then Bridge of Spies and Crimson Peak arrive on weekend three to eat into the adult moviegoing target audience. So the lack of IMAX screens and the competition on subsequent weekends are two of the biggest obstacles it faces.\nNow, aside from its financial prospects, is The Martian any good? Well, I’ve already mentioned that it’s a great film, but turn the page and read on for my full review of what makes it work, and the few things that perhaps don’t work as well as the rest!\nThe quick version is that The Martian offers a rich, compelling, extremely realistic sci-fi story with compelling characters and spectacular visual effects. It’s one of the smartest, coolest sci-fi movies in a long time, one of Matt Damon’s best roles, one of Ridley Scott’s finest pictures, and perhaps the most realistic sci-fi film ever made.\nThe first and most obvious comparison that jumps to mind is Apollo 13 , the Tom Hanks film portraying the true story of astronauts whose trip to the moon went terribly wrong, leaving them stranded in space in a damaged spacecraft and forced to devise ways to stay alive and return to Earth using whatever materials they could scrounge in the ship. NASA communicated with the astronauts during the crisis, working furiously to provide the lost crew with the instructions to repair their vessel, solve other problems aboard the vehicle, and make their way back to Earth.\nThe other comparison most people will make is to Cast Away , a fictional tale featuring Tom Hanks again. This time, he’s stranded on a deserted island while the rest of the world presumes he’s dead. Most of the film focuses on how he learns to stay alive, how he keeps himself sane, and how he finds hope for escape from the island and return to civilization.\nIf the Apollo 13 ship crashed on the Cast Away island and only Tom Hanks survived, that’d be a lot like The Martian . I know, I know, this is an odd comparison, but if you’re looking for an explanation of what to expect, this is the best one and it’s actually extremely accurate as far as movie comparisons go. If you need some other sort of comparison, then the recent — and exceptional — Robert Redford movie All Is Lost also has similarities to the general underlying premise of The Martian , particularly in how a knowledgable and experienced expert can devise inventive ways to stay alive. It’s all rooted in Robinson Crusoe , more or less.\nThere are also plenty of shades of Interstellar , including the attempt at hyper-realistic portrayal of science and space travel, plus Interstellar’s recurring theme of the lone astronaut stranded in space (Damon himself, Hathaway, David Oyelowo, Hathaway’s off-screen love interest, and McConaughey). Then there’s Chastain, who appeared in both Interstellar and The Martian , both times as someone separated from the main character on opposites sides of space yet “finding” him — and more subtly, Chastain and the other people of Earth in Interstellar are in essence stranded on a dead world trying to find ways to survive until salvation from another world comes to rescue them. Of course, director Ridley Scott is probably Christopher Nolan’s single biggest filmmaking influence, so this reverse comparison is especially interesting.\nThe Martian has something rare for a Scott film — a sense of humor. A good one, and a constant one. Matchstick Men is probably Scott’s only other film with a strong humorous streak, albeit a darker, satirical one. Here, though, the comedic and otherwise lighthearted moments help undercut what would otherwise be a somber, often grim dramatic story overshadowing the sense of hope and wonder underlying the broader themes about exploration, survival, progress, and humanity’s destiny among the stars.\nThe point isn’t merely about the individual struggle for life amid the chaos of nature’s myriad ways to kill us. Rather, it’s that our reach is only limited by our willingness to reach out, and when we determine to accomplish something and work together, we can achieve the seemingly impossible. To bring forth that message, the story uses levity and humor to punctuate drama and tragedy. It’s a potent mixture, and the results speak for themselves.\nThat’s really the crucial divide separating The Martian from all of the other films to which it might be compared — thematically, it’s not just a story of one individual’s struggle for survival. That theme itself is actually representative of the story’s larger and more fundamental theme about the survival of the human spirit regardless of the risks and sacrifices. It is in that sense that the movie has its strongest similarities and links to Interstellar , which focused on the overlap between the personal fight for survival, humanity’s need to go into space for our species’ survival, and how we need to rekindle our sense of adventure and exploration (even if the only way to do that is to make it about simple survival instinct).\nIn The Martian , we intuitively realize if Matt Damon doesn’t survive to escape from Mars, he still won’t regret a moment of his time in space, or even on Mars itself. Yes, he wants to survive, and yes everyone else wants him to live and come home, but more importantly they all want us to honor his sacrifices and efforts by continuing to dream and explore.\nThe Martian may also have the most attention to characterization not reflective of theme or tone. As Christopher Nolan said to me in a recent interview ( which you can read here ), Ridley Scott’s films construct their worlds with great care and precision, more so than almost any other films ( Blade Runner in particular is the best example of this, as Nolan pointed out). He does this again in The Martian , creating a world so real and present — not just on Mars, but also on Earth itself in the near-future, and on board the spacecraft headed toward Earth. But peopling this world are real people whose personalities shine in every scene, with excellent performances from the entire cast.\nAs much as science plays a major role in the story, it never overshadows the humanity and personal drama of the characters. Scott uses visual effects and science to enhance the rest of what drives this film, putting much more focus on emotions, relationships, and personality than on particulars of sci-fi plotting and imagery. Which all makes it simultaneously one of the most restrained yet epic films on Scott’s resume.\nWhen your film spends a lot of time showing how a scientist builds things and uses them to farm, eat, and do other routine daily activities, the necessity of keeping things fresh and forcing the audience to pay attention is crucial. In this, as in all else, The Martian succeeds admirably.\nMatt Damon shoulders most of that burden on the screen, performing largely alone and often in sequences of drama and action juxtaposed with prior/subsequent dialogue scenes explaining what he’s doing/going to do and how it all turned out. Sometimes it overlaps and intercuts, but Scott smartly avoids using a single approach, instead opting for a varied style so we don’t fall into subconscious expectation of repetition of sequencing. It’s also helped a great deal by Damon’s charm and endless likability, and the prevalent sense of humor.\nDamon's portrayal is so genuine, the emotions so seemingly spontaneous and often uncontrollable (his sudden choked weeping during a crucial moment feels so real you almost want to look away out of a subconscious sense you're violating his privacy during a very personal moment). And his sense of humor is always contextual -- sometimes it's fun-loving, sometimes self-depreciating, sometimes its gallows humor, and sometimes its a nervous attempt at deflecting darker thoughts. I always think you can measure the depths of a performer's talent and star power by how well they can work on screen alone for extended lengths of time. In this case, while the entire film is a joy and everyone on screen is exceptional, it could easily have just remained entirely on Damon for the duration and we'd never have wasted a glance at our watches.\nTurn the page and read the rest of my review of The Martian !\nVisually, The Martian looks gorgeous. None of the visual effects work is lingered on, it simply exists as part of the rest of the world of the film. Scenes of astronauts working in space around their ship are treated like any other scene, and look like they were filmed in outer space. Scenes on Mars look like Ridley Scott had the most expensive on-location shoot in history on another world. We’ve reached a point where sci-fi films set in space look just about as real as is probably possible, to the point if you saw footage from this movie and were told it was actual NASA footage from space and Mars, you’d likely not even question its authenticity.\nThe downside of that is, films that don’t bother to achieve the same sort of realism — even for simple shots of Earth from orbit, for example — better have a darn good excuse, because audiences are going to be increasingly picky about their expectations for top-notch visuals. But hey, that's a nice problem to have, right?\nThe Martian is another entry in the recent big-budget hyper-realistic science fiction portrayals of outer space, alien worlds, and space travel. Gravity , Interstellar , and now The Martian form a revival of the subgenre of “hard sci-fi” filmmaking in recent years. This subgenre also includes past examples such as Destination Moon (much of it is mistaken, but at the time it was extremely realistic and based on scientific beliefs about a lot of what goes on), The Andromeda Strain , 2001: A Space Odyssey (probably the most famous hard sci-fi film of all time), Solaris , Contact , Deep Impact , Gattaca , Children of Men , Primer (the low-budget sci-fi film, not the same-titled XX movie), Moon , and Contagion .\nNotice, however, that most of the modern examples from the last 20 years are set on Earth and mostly involve either disaster scenarios or otherwise grim perceptions of the future. Hard sci-fi about space travel was few and far between for many decades, as more fantastical, action-adventure, or horror-focused sci-fi/sci-fantasy dominated audience interests.\nSo it’s nice to see this growing audience appreciation for hard sci-fi, and the willingness of studios to invest healthy budgets in producing such films. Likewise, I’m happy that the concept of space travel as a real, important priority is manifesting again not only in cinema but in renewed public interest in space, and in the science related to space exploration of various sorts. It’s obviously got a lot to do with the discovery in recent years of potentially habitable planets, the incredible images of distant stars and galaxies, the unmanned missions providing clear photos of other worlds, and this week’s remarkable announcement that NASA has confirmed seasonal flowing water on Mars .\nThe Martian is the most purely hard sci-fi movie about space travel/exploration of the modern era, and quite possibly of all time. Even films like Gravity and Interstellar were ultimately less interested in adhering to realism and the pure science of the story at the moments when storytelling, plot, or themes needed to ignore grounded hard sci-fi in favor of speculative science or just outright adventurism, visual excitement, and other cinematic factors. But The Martian works hard to keep its story pretty squarely within the boundaries of the real world and scientific accuracy, and as a result it isn’t hard to pretend we’re seeing a film actually based on a true story about a NASA astronaut accidentally left on Mars. Everything makes sense, everything feels real, and everybody behaves pretty much as you might expect people in these situations to behave.\nOnly once, in an odd choice to mimic vaguely similar sort of scenes Gravity and Wall-E (the latter of which worked because it was a fantastical animated family story), does The Martian make the mistake of deviating slightly from grounded scientific realism for a quick moment that’s “technically possible” yet ultimately unnecessary silly thrill-seeking. The sequence could’ve easily transpired without it, and it exists merely to add an extra complication and danger to a climactic scene that was already more than tense enough.\nThis one minor mistaken choice, though, is insignificant in the larger scheme of things, and it’s so quick that it barely registers. Things move on fast enough, and the context around it is more than serious and realistic enough, so if some audience members enjoy the joke and superheroism reference of the unnecessary element, then that’s fine and I’m happy to personally ignore it.\nThe only other thing I wasn’t 100% sold on is the film’s denouement. I think it might’ve ended more satisfyingly a scene earlier, letting the actual climax itself stand as the exclamation mark. I didn’t feel a need to know what happened afterward, since the themes were so strong and well-portrayed in the rest of the film. That said, I realize a lot of other viewers will appreciate the final shots — particularly the foreign audiences to whom some of this is clearly meant to play best. As with my other nitpick, this doesn’t damage the film, though, and after I see it a few more times I might change my mind and come to appreciate it as the proper ending after all. For now, though, my gut feeling is that the better ending came a few minutes earlier in the final scene of the climactic moment.\nThe Martian is big, dramatic, unexpectedly funny, and immensely entertaining. It makes you dream of humanity’s destiny among the stars. Combined with this week’s thrilling announcement of NASA’s discovery of flowing water on Mars, it’s enough to make you want to fly out there to help hurry up and get the exploration started already.\nAll box office figures and tallies based on data via Box Office Mojo and TheNumbers .
