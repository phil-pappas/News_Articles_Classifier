Singers, dancers and musicians will perform at 3 p.m. Sunday at Landmark Theatre, 362 S. Salina St., Syracuse. Again, News Channel 9 anchor Carrie Lazarus is producing the show featuring local students she has profiled in her series and/or assisted financially, in some cases.\n\"It still feels so new and so exciting to me because every year I meet all these new kids and they become part of our little family,\" said Lazarus, referring to the show's third year.\n\"Extraordinary Live!\" will include new performers along with artists who have appeared in previous productions. First time performers include ballet dancer Kameron Triche, singer Josh Batstone, modern dancer Elias Eckert and singer, dancer Meghan Schwartz with performers from Open Jar Institute . Returning are dancer Tevin Johnson, violinist Shen Dai Wei, NOTEified jazz combo and singer Julia Goodwin. The talent showcase will open and close with musical numbers by students who have auditioned or attended Open Jar Institute, a summer theater arts program in New York City.\nFor this production, there will be more collaboration between the young artists and guest performers, said Lazarus. \"We're showing these extraordinary performers can work together, can make great music together instead of just focusing on the individual acts,\" she said.\nMany of the show's performers have been recipients of scholarships from the Carrie Lazarus Fund for Extraordinary Talent. Lazarus established the fund to give financial support to students without the means to pay for private lessons, attend summer programs or enroll in professional schools. She has raised $150,000 since founding her nonprofit three years ago and distributed $50,000 to more than 50 performing artists. The Community Foundation of Central New York oversees the fund. Proceeds from \"Extraordinary Live!\" will be donated to the fund.\nLazarus said she met Kameron after receiving a phone call from her father Howard Triche, former Syracuse University basketball player. He inquired if financial help would be available for his daughter who was interested in attending the Rock School for Dance Education in Philadelphia. \"That's how these little things happen. The phone rings one day. Now all of sudden you can help someone. You can invite someone to perform. That's why it's extraordinary, I guess.\"\nThe Fund for Extraordinary Talent also covered the tuition for NOTEified's saxophonist Dunham Hall to attend the summer Jazz Institute, Meghan Schwartz at the Open Jar Institute and dance lessons for Elias Eckert.\nThe opportunity to assist emerging artists is personally rewarding, said Lazarus. The fund founder wants Central New York's young talent to have opportunities to pursue their passion regardless of a family's financial situation. \"I'm trying to level the playing field,\" she said.\nLazarus will act as mistress of ceremony and introduce each performer with a video. The news anchor regularly profiles young artists for her weekly feature \"Extraordinary Talent of the Week\" on Channel 9 newscasts at 4 p.m. Tuesdays and repeated at 6:45 a.m. Wednesday. Lazarus also includes young artists for her occasional specials, \"Carrie Lazarus Presents Extraordinary People and Places of Central New York,\" on the TV station.\nTo apply for a scholarship, go online . If you have questions, email Lazarus .\nTickets for \"Extraordinary Live!\" are $10 and can be purchased online or at Landmark's box office.\nHere are the young performers and collaborators for Sunday's \"Extraordinary Live!\":\nOpen Jar Institute performing a Broadway medley Violinist Shen Dai Wei with pianist Ida Trebicka Dancer Tevin Johnson Vocalista Josh Batstone and guitarist Billy Harrison Dancer Elias Eckert with CMC Dance Company Jazz band NOTEified Vocalist Julia Goodwin with NOTEified Dancer Kameron Triche with Syracuse City Ballet Classical musicians Eastman Quartet Vocalist Josh Batstone and guitarist Billy Harrison Vocalist Julia Goodwin with NOTEified and Open Jar for the finale.", "external_links": ["http://www.ticketmaster.com/carrie-lazarus-presents-extraordinary-live-syracuse-new-york-10-11-2015/event/00004F2ED9AA55F4?artistid=2163659&majorcatid=10003&minorcatid=55", "http://www.openjarinstitute.com/", "http://www.therockschool.org/about-us", "https://www.cnycf.org/extraordinary#.VhWRJEZRI8I"], "published": "2015-10-08T21:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:04:34.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
