Many of his songs involve a horn section that are pretty powerful and add style to his music. It does seem to give the listener that the music is jazzy, but other songs in the collection of this recording give in a pop sensation to it.\nThe third song “Body Karate” has an easy-listening feel to it, and it tends to be a different entity compared to the first two songs, “African” and “Stars”. Still, James manages to capture the listener with a good voice and just plain good music.\nBig Blue Mixtape also comes with some live recordings which are incredible. Again, the compilation is filled with different types of genres, yet still falling as one beautifully put-together creation that reacts as one.\n“ The Other Me ” is a song that has a pop-R&B feel to it. At the same time, the guitars on this track are played with a ska style at times. The final sound is quite good and it ends up being a killer song.\nThere is also some funk involve by having some keyboards go at it in some of the songs in this recording by James. It never stops to amaze the listener how good the songs are and how each song is approached with a different style.\nIn the end, Big Blue Mixtape by Galen James has the right notes to be a good piece to add to anyone’s collection of music. It displays a lot of talent by putting out a sound that is very jazzy with hints of R&B. It is downright good music and a good piece to own.", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkAa6n511Bg", "https://galen.bandcamp.com/", "https://twitter.com/GalenJamesMusic", "https://galen.bandcamp.com/album/big-blue-mixtape"], "published": "2015-10-26T17:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:27:14.950+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
