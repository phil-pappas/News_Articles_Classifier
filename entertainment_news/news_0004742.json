For the second time in her life, Ann is getting confetti! What a game! #dealornodeal pic.twitter.com/a61zQo5qam \n— Deal or No Deal (@dealornodeal) October 15, 2015 \nThe 75-year-old bellringer, nicknamed Queen Ann amongst the contestants, refused a final offer from the Banker of £64,000, with only the 50p and £250,000 boxes left in play. \nAnn also turned down the offer to swap her box – only to reveal she had the top prize in her box all throughout the game. \nWhen the wily Banker tried to outsmart her by giving her the chance to buy Box 23 – which could see her double, quarter, add an extra £10k or lose all her winnings, she mixed up her words and replied: “Deal no”, instead of “No deal.” It's another one of those moments – Ann has shocked us all by buying Box 23…by accident. #dealornodeal pic.twitter.com/WBiCShpGJE \n— Deal or No Deal (@dealornodeal) October 15, 2015 \nThe Banker then asked her the question again, to which she declined the offer, which would have pick the ‘Nothing’ box and seen her lose the £250,000. \nHost Noel Edmonds said: “This has been one of the most amazing hours of my whole life. \n“It’s an extraordinary game at the best and worst of times but then someone comes along and plays the game so much their own way that it literally takes your breath away. Congratulations Ann!” We caught up with Ann after the show and she's understandably emotional. http://t.co/mGHu0l7XJw #dealornodeal pic.twitter.com/fZm8B8StkY \n— Deal or No Deal (@dealornodeal) October 15, 2015 \nAnn, who became a widow in 2003 when her husband died, said she will take her family on a holiday, and has also treated herself to a new car since her win. \nViewers were understandably moved by Ann’s win. Sat here in my dressing gown crying at @dealornodeal because Anne just won't a quarter of a million!
