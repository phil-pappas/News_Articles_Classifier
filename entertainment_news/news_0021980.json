Thompson character from \"Where the Buffalo Roam.\" Worse, he's the star in a story that doesn't even belong to his tired, aging main character.\nMurray plays Richie Lanz, an over-the-mountain, has-been rock musician manager in Van Nuys, California.\nrelated advertisement \"Rock the Kasbah\"\n★ ★\nStarring: Bill Murray, Leem Lubany, Kate Hudson, Bruce Willis, Danny McBride, Zooey Deschanel\nDirected by: Barry Levinson\nOther: An Open Roads Films release. Rated R for drug use, language, sexual references, violence. 100 minutes He's down to his last meal ticket with his quasi-talented assistant, singer Ronnie Smiler (a total waste of the amazing Zooey Deschanel).\nActing on the advice of a drunk soldier, Richie and Ronnie head to Afghanistan to make money by entertaining the troops through the USO, unaware that Kabul and other communities have become the lawless Wild Wild East with guns, bombs and fights.\nRonnie panics and bolts for the airport, leaving Richie with no cash, no passport, no hope and no way back home.\nThen, one night, the down-on-his-luck agent hears the sound of an angel singing.\nSalima Khan (Leem Lubany), a Pashtun teenager, possesses a voice like warm honey. She dreams of becoming the nation's first female to compete on \"Afghan Star,\" Afghanistan's version of \"American Idol.\"\nShe has one, itty-bitty, teensy-weensy problem. She will be killed on the spot if she moves, because dancing is prohibited under religious rules.\nPlus, her conservative dad feels ashamed of being the father of \"the (prostitute) who sings,\" as the men call her.\nFrom the start, Mitch Glazer's screenplay gets it all wrong. In fashioning a star vehicle for Murray, Glazer fails to recognize the true protagonist of his movie: the talented artist challenging the status quo and shaking things up at the risk of her own life.\nHer American agent and publicist should be a supporting character at best.\nIn Glazer's story, he functions as the hero, embarking on a noble mission to snare his cut of an entertainer's earnings.\n\"This is nuts!\" Richie screeches. He could be reviewing his own movie.\nGranted, no Hollywood actor outside of Tom Hanks carries more good will with moviegoers than Wilmette native Bill Murray. The public loves his sleepy-eyed persona, his hip, quietly cool attitude, and his quirky, unpredictable behavior.\nHere's a \"Saturday Night Live\" alum turned serious/comic actor who turned down roles in \"The Santa Clause,\" \"Shrek,\" \"Airplane,\" \"Rain Man,\" \"Forrest Gump\" and \"Toy Story.\"\nYet, he accepted Richie, whose tics, mannerisms, delivery and attitudes come from Murray's earlier characters, and these aren't even a collection of his greatest hits.\nMeanwhile, \"Rock the Kasbah\" shortchanges its strongest asset, Lubany's star-turning performance as a defiant female artist demanding equality and the pursuit of happiness in a culture where women's talents, like their bodies, must remain invisible.\n(Glazer's story has a real-life inspiration. In 2007, a Pashtun woman named Setara Hussainzada sang and danced on Afghanistan television. Death threats forced her into hiding.)\n\"Kasbah\" lavishes attention on its supporting stars: Kate Hudson as an exotic, bejeweled prostitute who takes Richie for a ride on what she calls her \"401-K Tour.\"\nAnd Bruce Willis, playing an AARP version of his \"Die Hard\" cop John McClane, now a tattooed mercenary named Bombay Brian. (\"Do you go by Mumbai now?\" Richie asks.)\nAnd Danny McBride with Scott Caan as none-too-smart war profiteers dealing in under-the-table armaments.\nLevinson's \"Rock the Kasbah\" isn't a total washout, just disappointing in how it fails to maximize on its dramatic potential, mostly, Lubany's magically reconfigured vintage songs from Cat Stevens.\nWhen she cuts loose, oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world.\n Life & Entertainment Movies Entertainment", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-23T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:31:46.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
