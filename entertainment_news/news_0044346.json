This cult classic is always must-see viewing. Jeff Bridges plays an ageing hippie (THE DUUUUDE!!) who, in a case of mistaken identity is forced to win a bowling tournament and search for a wealthy industrialist's kidnapped wife, all while getting involved with all sorts of oddball characters. A comedy brought to you by the legends that are The Coen brothers, along with a cracker of a cast that includes John Goodman, Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, David Huddleston, Philip Seymour Hoffman and John Turturro.
