Summit is an industry leader that has over 20 years of experience matching clients with suitable sponsorship partners. They have a proven track record of launching and providing massive growth for a diverse list of clients.\nMFF is one of the fastest growing film festivals in the world. They are grown from small start-up festival to a globally recognized event. They were founded on the eve of the 2008 financial crisis and have done this without the benefit of sponsorship. In 2011 they introduced their Filmmaker Revenue Sharing Program. In one year the festival grew an astonishing 700%. The program has since raised tens of thousands of dollars for independent filmmakers. They are looking to leverage that momentum to create an even greater festival experience that will benefit sponsors, movie-goers, and filmmakers alike.\nAfter reviewing data and demographics, Summit has identified new opportunities beneficial to potential sponsors. They have created 10th anniversary sponsorship packages tiered to accommodate sponsors in a range that fits budgets and needs.
