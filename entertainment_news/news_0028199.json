Set list for Chicago at the Landmark Theatre in Syracuse on Wednesday, Oct. 21, 2015 Chris Baker | cbaker@syracuse.com Just two weeks ago, after 48 years of music, the brass-driven rock band received its first-ever nomination for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland. In nearly half a decade, the group has never missed a year of touring, playing on through hardships -- like the loss of Terry Kath -- and members leaving the group, like Peter Cetera. \nThe perseverance and longevity of Chicago has to be linked to the band's collaborative nature (and their 36 albums). No one musician is the front man. Rather, each shares the limelight, taking turns on vocals, lead duties or even solo numbers. They play rock 'n roll, but with the pacing and precision of a big band jazz group. \nAmong them, however, founding member and trombonist Pankow was the most animated Wednesday night, revving the crowd relentlessly, tossing winks at fans in the front rows and swinging his horn around like a machine gun. With his shirt half unbuttoned, his sleeves missing and his collar popped, the 68-year-old was proof incarnate that age is just a state of mind. \nOn the whole, Chicago felt less like a group that's been at this for 48 years and more like new kids on the block, soaking in every moment and relishing their time onstage. Musically, they're consummate pros -- tight, polished and very, very well rehearsed. But nowhere was there a hint that this is starting to get old for these guys. \nThey played like much younger men, and the audience (though seated most of the show) rose to its feet to dance along for the final half hour. They strolled through easy listening hits like \"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\" and \"Saturday in the Park\" along with rock favorites like \"Feelin' Stronger Everyday.\" They played an acoustic showcase. Even the pair of beat-keepers took an extended solo that was part showing off and part shtick comedy (thanks to the eccentric Walfredo Reyes, Jr.) \nUltimately, they wrapped with \"25 or 6 to 4.\" Chicago at the Landmark Theatre Chicago performs \"25 or 6 to 4\" at the Landmark Theatre in Syracuse, Oct. 21, 2015. \nFollowing their final bow, a handful of band members stuck around onstage, shaking hands with the crowd, giving out picks and accepting gushing compliments from adoring fans. They seemed unready to leave, eager to soak in every minute, as if this was all brand new to them. \nAfter 48 years, these guys genuinely seem to still love it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:37:08.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
