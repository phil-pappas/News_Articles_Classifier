He had tweeted earlier last week, in response to the rumors saying \" Many rumours on Baahubali-3..:) The story will conclude with part-2. No dragging..but the world of Baahubali will continue in a way that's been never experienced before ever. Will reveal the details when appropriate. don't believe the rumours. Only I know what's going to come..:) (sic)\" but this tweet ended up causing more confusion. The director realised this on Saturday and posted \"LooksLike I created more confusion instead of giving clarity..apologies..Baahubali-3 is on cards... But the story that's written for the Two parts will not be dragged for the sake of it. This story will conclude with the second part itself. Baahubali-3 will be done in a way that audience have never experienced films before. Hope that clarifies..\"\nSo Baahubali 3 will definitely happen but it won't be a continuation of the first two films. Fans who are eagerly awaiting the conclusion to part one in part two, will not be disappointed.\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-26T21:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:53:07.511+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
