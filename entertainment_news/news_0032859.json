Shows are held Friday nights and are followed by a laser light show set to music on the first and third Fridays of the month. Courtesy Just sit back in your reclined seat and take in the astral sights projected on the large dome above.On Friday nights, you can head over to Laramie to view a star show at the University of Wyoming Planetarium, located in a basement theater in the campus's physical science building.The planetarium has been open for at least a dozen years, said director Travis Laurance. In the summer of 2014, it closed for renovations, and the theater was outfitted with a new dome, digital projectors and new seats.Since reopening in November 2014, Laurance and a group of undergraduate students have been working to make the star shows even better.\"The Friday night shows we do, they're almost all done by undergrad students,\" Laurance said. \"They actually come up with the topics themselves. They've done an amazing job.\"Since the 58-seat planetarium reopened, Laurance said they have rarely hosted repeat shows, saying the students have been working to create something original. Although they are paid for their work, he said the staff has managed to find students who are passionate about astronomy.\"They keep coming up with ideas,\" he said.In addition to star shows on Friday nights, there is a one-hour laser light show on the first and third Friday of each month. Unlike the star shows, these are brought in from a company and are set to music from artists like Daft Punk and Michael Jackson, Laurance said.The star shows draw a mix of families, students and adults, but the laser shows seem to be more populated by UW students, he said.On the Fridays without the laser shows, visitors can go to the building's roof to look through the 16-inch telescope and see the night sky.Some of the more popular star shows have been ones that focus on Greek mythology or planets, especially Jupiter, Saturn and Pluto.\"It's fascinating how many people are interested in Pluto,\" he said.Laurance said he has noticed there is a handful of \"repeat customers,\" such as one couple that likes to arrive early to nab their favorite seats. But the goal is to get more children in the seats.\"We really want to inspire the younger generation,\" he said.To do that, they have begun offering more child-themed shows on Saturdays, such as one focused on volcanic activity in space. The staff is still experimenting with the shows' themes, but Laurance said he has noticed the children seem to be excited to visit.
