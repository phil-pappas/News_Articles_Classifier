According to Deadline , the 24-year-old actress is on board to play Robin Hood's love interest Maid Marian. In the upcoming movie, the Irish-born actress will star alongside Taron Egerton , who portrays the young version of the title character. The site claims that Hewson beat out over 100 young actresses before she finally landed the role. Lionsgate previously planned to start principal photography on February, but it was delayed until Egerton finishes \"Kingsman 2\". Filming will commence probably at the end of summer 2016. \"Robin Hood: Origins\" is said to center on the heroic outlaw who \"returns from fighting in The Crusades and finds that Sherwood Forest is rife with corruption and evil. He forms a band of outlaws and they take matters into their own hands.\" Otto Bathurst (\"The Peaky Blinders\") is on board to direct. The official release date has yet to be announced, but the movie is expected to arrive in North America in 2017. Hewson will next be seen in the Steven Spielberg-directed \" Bridge of Spies \" alongside Tom Hanks , Amy Ryan , Alan Alda, Mark Rylance and Billy Magnussen. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Robin Hood: Origins News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T09:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:48:14.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
