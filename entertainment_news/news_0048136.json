She kept herself warm with a sky blue denim jacket and blue stockings paired with combat boots. She sported a multi-coloured dreadlocked hair extension and wore sunglasses although it was dark outside. She also carried a Unicorn Tears bag and held a beverage in one hand, reports aceshowbiz.com. The 22-year-old is gearing up to host the season 41 premiere of “Saturday Night Live” airing this weekend. In a promo which also features regular cast member Taran Killam, she teases that she will be hosting “with or without clothes – we’re not sure yet”. In another sketch, Cyrus reveals what she will wear on the variety series. She shows three small strips of fabric held together with some string, prompting Killam to say, “So no pants.” Miley responds, “What are pants?” The “Wrecking ball” hitmaker will also serve as musical guest in the episode.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T03:12:05.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
