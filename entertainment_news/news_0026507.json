His friend was killed from the impact, and the stories coming out of the hospital about his health weren’t all that encouraging. Many wondered if the actor/comedian would even be able to talk again, let alone get back on stage and tell jokes. \nWell, by the grace of some great doctors and the comedy gods, Morgan is healthy and hilarious again and no comedian had more people pulling for him as host of Saturday Night Live. \nIt was so good to have him back. \nHere are the high and lowlights: \nCOLD OPEN: \nThe spoof of the Democratic debate would have felt as dull and long as the real thing if it weren’t for Larry David. Yes, the Seinfeld co-creator made a special guest appearance to play the role of his lifetime: Senator Bernie Sanders. With David’s posture, voice, and old man crankiness, he could have been Bernie’s long-lost brother. And he wanted you to know he only owns one pair of underwear. Tracy Morgan’s former 30 Rock co-star Alec Baldwin joined David onstage to play the war veteran Jim Webb, but just like in the real debate – he was overshadowed. \nMONOLOGUE: \nThe first words out of Morgan’s mouth were slurred. But don’t worry - he was only yanking your chain about the speech impediment and brain damage. Ha ha. He did set aside a few moments to get sentimental and talked about how he called Lorne Michaels (his “Obi-Wan”) after the accident and said “When I get back on my feet, I want to come home.” Home was the SNL stage and the emotion was palpable in the audience. The rest of the monologue had a nice but unfunny reunion with Baldwin, Jane Krakowski, Jack McBrayer and Tina Fey. The four reprised their old 30 Rock roles for a fake 2012 episode that kept getting interrupted with annoying pop up graphics of NBC’s Smash. — Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl) October 18, 2015 \nBEST SKETCH: \nBRIAN FELLOW’S SAFARI PLANET \nMorgan had fun bringing back some of his most memorable characters like clueless “animal enthusiast” Brian Fellow. This time, Fellow was introduced to a beaver (“That’s crazy!”) and asked about its smoking habits before sharing the stage with a real live camel. The old showbiz adage about never acting with children or animals proved true once again when the beast stepped in front of the camera, blocking everyone in the shot with its massive butt. \nWORST SKETCH: \nCLOCK MAKER BERNARD \nMorgan played the clock maker in an Elizabethan-era hamlet who made the chaste townsfolk uncomfortable with his comments about seeing a horse pee. The sketch was actually funny until Clock Maker Bernard encouraged everyone to say whatever they wanted – and the pastor (Taran Killam) revealed he was sleeping with a stable boy. Unfortunately, it all built up to that. \nMUSICAL GUEST: \nDEMI LOVATO \nWith lyrics like “B----, I run this show,” and “It’s time to get the chains out,” it’s clear Demi Lovato’s Disney days are long gone. She’s an adult now with high-heeled boots and a horn section. Her first performance “Cool For The Summer” was an up-tempo romp while the second song, a stripped-down ballad called “Stone Cold,” gave her a chance to really show off her pipes. The notes were a little squeaky at first, but overall, she blew the roof off the joint. \nBEST WAY TO MISPRONOUNCE JANE KRAKOWSKI’S NAME: \n“Jane Karowski” \nWith Tracy Morgan, nothing stays serious for long. Even when the comedian was on stage with his wife and daughter for a final thank you, he cracked Tina Fey up by horribly mispronouncing Jane Krakowski’s name as “Karowski.” They worked together for seven years, but hey, it’s cool. He ended with a big thanks to SNL executive producer Lorne Michaels, telling him “I love you like I love my daddy.” Not many people can say that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T20:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:52:54.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
