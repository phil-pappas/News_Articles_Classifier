Since Nick began the transition, I have seen him three times. Last week when I was visiting, I accidentally called Nick by the wrong pronoun, “she” instead of “he,” a couple of times. After I got home I sent Nick a text to apologize and explain that it would take time for me to get used to saying “Nick” and referring to him as a he. All weekend I could tell they were irritated with me, and I felt it was uncalled for. Am I wrong to feel hurt that they haven’t given me a chance to get used to the new name? Adjusting to gender reassignment takes time for all concerned. [...] it also seems to me that you are being overly sensitive about what happened. How else is a person to learn that a mistake was made if it isn’t pointed out? Recently, 12 of us women from a retirement home in Dayton were having lunch at a local steakhouse. Dear Blessed: I don’t know who originated this saying, but your letter certainly proves the truth of it: A good deed is like a pebble thrown into a pond; its ripples continue ever outward.
