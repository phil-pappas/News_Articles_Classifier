CHEQUE IT OUT: Mt Sheridan's Jo Willoughby has won $20,000 on TV show Millionaire Hot Seat. PICTURE: STEWART MCLEAN Source: News Limited \nTENACITY and trivia proved the TV golden ticket for Mt Sheridan’s Jo Willoughby, who scooped $20,000 in this week’s Millionaire Hot Seat . \nMs Willoughby, who works in Calanna Pharmacy in Woree, is a trivia fan and auditioned for the show in January 2013, and only got the call in June this year to tell her that she had made the cut. \nSpeechless when she received the message at work to ask if she was still interested, she recovered enough to call back and found herself whisked away to Melbourne for the show. \n“They pick you up early and bring you to the studio for hair and makeup, and then you do rehearsals with a fake Eddie (McGuire) to put you at ease,” Ms Willoughby said. \nThe show itself was a whirlwind of emotion. \n“I’m very emotional and I cry at the drop of a hat,” Ms Willoughby said. \n“I was so nervous too and when I won the $20,000, I think it didn’t hit me for a minute – I sat there stunned.” \nShe watched the show this week while drinking some champagne and received many well wishes from friends around the country. \nThe mementos from the show – the novelty cheque and a photograph of her with McGuire – will join her keepsakes from her best life experiences. \nMs Willoughby will use the money for a holiday in Egypt with her son and on household items.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T07:32:25.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
