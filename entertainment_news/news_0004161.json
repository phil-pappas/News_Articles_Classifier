Close 'Strictly Come Dancing': All The Winners of   Newsreader Natasha Kaplinsky was the first star to ever triumph in the inaugural series of 'Strictly Come Dancing', back in 2004, when there were just seven competitors to beat. Having obviously been a hit with 'Strictly' viewers, she was later chosen to cover for regular presenter Tess Daly, when she went on maternity leave. Clearly sensing they were onto a winner, the BBC decided to kick-start the second series of 'Strictly' just three months after Natasha Kaplinsky's victory, securing its spot in the Saturday night schedule in the latter half of the year. Jill Halfpenny was crowned winner second time around, along with her partner, Darren Bennet. Darren became the first male celebrity to triumph in the 'Strictly Come Dancing' final in 2005, beating Colin Jackson and eventual 'It Takes Two' presenter Zoe Ball in the process. Cricket player Mark Ramprakash took home the glitter-ball trophy a year later. Here he is performing with his professional partner, Karen Hardy, at the BBC Sports Personality Of The Year Awards a year after his victory. 'Strictly' helped breathe new life into Alesha's career, when she and partner Matthew Cutler were crowned winners. Her smash hit solo single 'The Boy Does Nothing' followed soon after, not to mention a spot on the 'Strictly' judging panel... until Simon Cowell decided to snare her for 'BGT', that is. 'Holby City' actor Tom Chambers' public profile skyrocketed, when he and his professional partner, Camilla Dallerup, were crowned winners of the sixth series. They beat TV presenter Lisa Snowdon and 'Negotiate With Love' singer Rachel Stevens in the live final, back in 2008. Chris Hollins gave professional dancer Ola Jordan her first, and so far only, win back in 2010. Kara and Artem had a double victory in 2010. Shortly after taking home the glitter-ball trophy, they announced that they were dating. Can we please just take a moment to appreciate this photo? The tenth series was won by Olympian Louis Smith and his professional partner, Flavia Cacace. In the first ever all-female 'Strictly' final, Abbey beat Susanna Reid and Natalie Gumede to the glitter-ball trophy. Fourth place was also a female contestant, with Sophie Ellis-Bextor leaving the competition at the semi-final stage. And then there was the most recent 'Strictly' winner, Caroline Flack, who took part in the competition less than a year after leaving 'X Factor' spin-off show, 'Xtra Factor'. Apparently sensing her popularity was on the rise, Simon Cowell quickly signed her up to host the main show, alongside Olly Murs.  Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T22:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T22:53:48.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
