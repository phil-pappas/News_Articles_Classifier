Matthews split from his girlfriend Lauren Hutton last month amid claims he cheated on her while on a night out and his co-star and former girlfriend Thomson has now spoken out to confess she was shocked to see how indifferent he seemed about the breakup, reports dailymail.co.uk. “I don’t think he has feelings, personally,” Thompson said. The 25-year-old, whose boyfriend Alik Alfus earlier moved back to New York, explained: “He was actually round my house a few days after (the split). It was when Alik was in town, and he invited him over because he wanted to see him like everyone else. And he was there just explaining everything so nonchalantly. “(It was) as if none of it ever existed… As if he doesn’t really care about anyone.” Related Posts", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:04:32.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
