It meant that over the years my whole career has been acknowledged by the Siminovitch jury. To be the recipient is an incredible honour, and an extraordinary gift which offers the possibility of freedom.” \nThis year's jury included Bob White, Philip Akin, Gideon Arthurs, Genevieve Blais and Kim Collier. \nThey recognized La Bissonniere for her \"extraordinary talent to create epic, eye-popping environments that manage to remain intimate, subtle and totally actor-friendly.\" \nThey also praised her \"ability to imagine complete, original worlds for the plays she designs and to empower actors to lay bare the human soul.\" \nLa Bissonniere receives $75,000 for herself while $25,000 goes to the protege she chose — Marilene Bastien. \nNow into its 15th year, the prize recognizes a body of work in design, direction and play writing in three-year cycles. \nThe other three finalists receive $5,000 apiece.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:29:28.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
