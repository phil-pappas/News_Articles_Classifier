Photo: Elesa Kurtz \nRegular visitors to the National Gallery of Australia may find something missing for the next short while.\nBlue Poles,  the gallery's star attraction usually seen hanging in all its abstract expressionist glory in a 12-metre high gallery space, has been taken off display.\nBut it's for the sake of those regulars – as well as the rare or never-been-before visitors – that Jackson Pollock's 63-year-old painting will remain deep within the bowels of the gallery's conservation lab for the next four weeks undergoing a careful makeover and clean.\nNational Gallery of Australia staff work to rehang the collection. Photo: Elesa Kurtz \nThe entire gallery is undergoing a huge revamp to bring the Australian art collection downstairs for the first time and to put international art upstairs.\nAdvertisement It's all for a bid to bring back visitors who feel they've seen it all before, especially those in the gallery's home city, and to make the collection more accessible to the less art-savvy. \nIn a first for any Australian gallery, artworks on both floors will be hung in themed mini-exhibitions which will change every four to six months, assistant director of exhibitions and collections Adam Worrall said, rather than in strict chronological order.\nAll Australian artworks are being brought to the ground floor as part of the gallery's rehang. Photo: Elesa Kurtz \n\"All the old favourites will be on display but in a slightly different context to before with a whole bunch of new things people haven't seen,\" he said.\n\"We're hanging it in a way general visitors want to see it ... the themes are obvious and the content is exciting.\n\"You don't need to know every ism in Australia's art history to walk through and appreciate the hanging.\"\nThe new home of Arthur Streeton's Golden Summer, Eaglemont at the NGA.

Photo: Elesa Kurtz \n\"It's been about watching what our visitors respond to, knowing the works they love to ensure they stay on display and wanting to show them some new things they don't know about us,\" Mr Worrall said.\nThe gallery's staff along with teams of consultants and experts from across the country have spent seven months planning the rehang, but with no new money the project has been funded within its existing budget.\nAttracting return visitors was a problem all galleries faced, Mr Worrall said, but the overhaul, the gallery's first in 15 years, was intended to boost numbers.\nIn 2014/15 the National Gallery of Victoria was the most visited gallery in the country for the second year running with about 2.3 million visitors to its two venues, its annual report released last Wednesday revealed.\nMr Worrall said the NGA would never be able to compete with its Victorian counterpart until it was on the same scale.\n\"There are definitely plans afoot for the future of this institution for us to be competing with the major state galleries, but that involves us building additional buildings so we can display more of the collection,\" he said.\n\"The NGV has two buildings the same size as what we currently have and they count visitors at both venues.\"\nNGA visitors may have heard the sounds of jackhammers and found parts of the gallery off limits in recent weeks, but Mr Worrall said each section will be progressively reopened as its finished and everything will be done in time for the opening of the Tom Roberts summer blockbuster on December 4 .\nWork to demolish and rebuild walls, and rearrange and restore artworks has been \"choreographed within an inch of its life\" into just eight weeks to minimise the disruption and ensure must-see works like Blue Poles will be off display for the shortest possible time.\nBlue Poles will move into a purpose-built gallery space upstairs where visitors will literally see the piece in a whole light under a new lighting system in a lower ceiling space.\nOlder colonial Australian works will \"look brand new\" when they are rehung closely together as they would have in the era they were made on freshly painted white walls.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:10:36.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
