For, right after it was confirmed that Shruti Haasan is part of the Suriya-starrer, Anushka told us she's also part of the film. \"It feels nice to be a part of the film. It was my first film with Suriya and we only know how it started. We started the project without ever imagining it will become such a superhit. But now that Singam has become a brand name, with the film being remade in Bollywood, it feels great! Each time you go back and work with the same people, it is even better because you already share a bond with them,\" she says.\nWith a slew of women-centric films in her kitty, Anushka has earned the tag of being a lady superstar. But the actress prefers to be called Anushka. \"There are people in the industry who deserve that title. We are hardly 5% of it... Maybe, 20-30 years later, if I am still doing good films... But definitely not now,\" says Anushka.\nTalking about putting on weight for Size Zero, the actress said, \"I didn't think too much as the project was worth the effort.\" And what about rumours linking her with Arya? Anushka laughs and says, \"It is not only Arya. In the Telugu industry, they link me with every other actor. Thankfully, there have been no reports with Rana (Daggubati) as yet, since we call each other brother and sister. But such things are part of life. So, it doesn't matter.\" ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-05T01:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T05:55:00.418+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
