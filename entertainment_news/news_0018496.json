(AP) — Atlantic City taxpayers have been left on the hook for about $65,000 security costs from this year's Miss America pageant parade.\nThe Press of Atlantic City reports (http://bit.ly/1jekvY0 ) the city was forced to cover the tab after organizers said they couldn't pay.\nThe Miss America Organization says the Boardwalk parade is like other major events that rely on public agencies for security and that it wasn't privy to costs.\nThe newspaper obtained cost-related emails through an open records request.\nRecords show the Miss America Organization ran an $882,278 deficit in 2013, the year the pageant returned to Atlantic City from Las Vegas.\nThe organization now says it's on firm financial footing.\nState officials helped lure the pageant by promising a $7.3 million subsidy package through the end of this year.\n___\nInformation from: The Press of Atlantic City (N.J.), http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com\nPress of Atlantic City Atlantic City Miss America pageant", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:25:39.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
