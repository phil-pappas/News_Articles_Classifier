Starring Casey Affleck , Woody Harrelson , Kate Winslet and Aaron Paul , the movie follows the story of a group of corrupt and crooked cops who plan a major heist. Harrelson plays Sergeant Detective Jeffrey Allen, the uncle to the cop played by Affleck. The nearly-two-minute video begins with drunk Allen talking to Affleck's character. It then continues with the scene where the heist takes place. Gun war, explosions, beheading, bloods and other ruthless actions dominate the movie as a group of dirty cops plot to kill a police officer who tries to prevent the big heist. According to the official synopsis, \"a crew of dirty cops is blackmailed by the Russian mob to execute a virtually impossible heist and the only way to pull it off is to manufacture a 999, police code for 'officer down.' Their plan is turned upside down when the unsuspecting rookie they set up to die foils the attack, triggering a breakneck action-packed finale tangled with double-crosses, greed and revenge.\" The movie has a star-studded cast which also includes Norman Reedus , Chiwetel Ejiofor , Anthony Mackie , Gal Gadot , Teresa Palmer and Clifton Collins Jr. . John Hillcoat directs the movie with a script penned by Matt Cook. The crime drama is due to open in North America on February 19, 2016. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 Leave a Comment Required fields are marked with *", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T11:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:34:20.999+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
