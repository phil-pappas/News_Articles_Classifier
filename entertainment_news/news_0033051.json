One hundred journalists from across the country supported the event by sharing their stories on how they got started in news and by tweeting photo of themselves.\n“The Open Newsroom Day is a fantastic opportunity for young people from communities that are under-represented in newsrooms to experience, first hand, the reality of a working newsroom and to network with those working in the industry. The CDN News Industry Working Group have created a successful template which engages young people across the country, opens doors and encourages their ambitions for a career in the industry.”\n– Amanda Ariss, Executive Director , Creative Diversity Network On camera a chance to sit in the studio and read the news Credit: ITV Meridian News Learning about the role of the Television Director Credit: ITV News Meridian Last updated Wed 21 Oct 2015 Read more 1 update Getting to do the news!
