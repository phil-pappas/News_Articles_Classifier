Frances Ruffelle, Colm Wilkinson and SuBo fan Patti Lupone (Daniel Leal-Olivas/PA) \nSusan appeared on the TV talent show in April 2009 singing I Dreamed A Dream, a song made famous by Patti in her role as Fantine in the musical’s original cast. \nSpeaking ahead of Les Mis’ 30th anniversary gala, Patti said: “I was told last night by Trevor Jackson (executive producer for Cameron Mackintosh Ltd) that Susan Boyle was the one that turned this around. This one is STORMING the Barricade! #LesMiz30 x pic.twitter.com/rb5kchclzR \n— Les Misérables (@lesmisofficial) October 8, 2015 \n“It wasn’t necessarily limping but it may not have lasted the 30 years, and Susan Boyle, by singing that song, created another fever around it. I got a lovely royalty cheque so good for Susan Boyle! \n“What can I say? Good for Susan Boyle. It was surprising because she was a mess and suddenly she opened her mouth and it was like, ‘Good for you, girl!’” Patti added of the Scotswoman’s talent show performance. Promoted stories Actor Ryan O’Gorman prepping for the anniversary performance (Daniel Leal-Olivas/PA) \nPatti was among the former cast members who joined the current company for a spectacular finale of One Day More at the Queen’s Theatre to celebrate the musical’s record-breaking anniversary. \nThirty years to the day after taking the stage at the Barbican Centre, Colm Wilkinson, Roger Allam and Frances Ruffelle also reprised their roles as Jean Valjean, Inspector Javert and Eponine respectively for the gala in aid of Save The Children’s Syria’s Children appeal. The anniversary performance was at the Queen’s Theatre (Daniel Leal-Olivas/PA) \nA choir of 126 Welsh schoolchildren flanked the audience, having been picked by producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh from the musical’s schools edition programme for the dramatic climax. \nFormer Jean Valjeans John Owen-Jones and Geronimo Rauch also returned to celebrate the record-breaking milestone. \nColm Wilkinson came out of retirement to reprise his lead role and reminisced about their first performance, which was panned by reviewers. Colm Wilkinson (centre) said the first performance of the show was panned by reviewers (Doug Peters/PA) \n“The critics panned it but the people voted with their feet. There was a void for this kind of thing, people reached out, they embraced it. They hadn’t seen anything like this before,” he said. \nFrances said the cast had no idea how abiding the musical would become and admitted that replaying the role was still “nerve-wracking” years later. \n— Les Misérables (@lesmisofficial) October 8, 2015 \n“We knew we were in something really special, but if someone had said this would last 30 years, it wasn’t something you could imagine,” she said. \nProving the producers also underestimated the phenomenon it would become, Colm was offered the lead in Phantom Of The Opera at the same time, and was told by Sir Cameron Mackintosh: “If Les Mis doesn’t work, you can do the Phantom.” Composer Claude-Michel Schonberg (Doug Peters/PA) \nSome 450 tickets for the special gala were made available through a lottery and charity auction to raise money for child refugees inside Syria and across the region. \nBased on Victor Hugo’s novel and with a score by Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schonberg, Les Miserables opened at the Barbican Centre in London on October 8 1985 and has now been seen by 70 million people worldwide in 44 countries and 22 languages.
