The production is solid throughout and his vocal delivery is infectious, though his content lacks some depth. \nWap is not much of a lyricist, but he uses the same winning-formula of keeping his sound melodic yet grungy on his 17-track album. It works on \"Couple Bandz\" and \"Again,\" another Top 40 hit, where he attempts to convince a lover that he's about chasing money instead other women. \nOn \"RGF Island,\" Wap brags about spending excessive money with his crew on an island. He introduces a loyal mate to the street life on \"Jugg,\" featuring Monty, who makes his presence known on multiple songs on \"Fetty Wap.\" \nOutside of rapping about selling drugs on \"Trap Luv\" and money and cars on \"Time,\" there's not much substance on Wap's debut. But this is a musical approach that works for him — for now. \nFollow Jonathan Landrum Jr. on Twitter: http://twitter.com/MrLandrum31 \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T21:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:16:27.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
