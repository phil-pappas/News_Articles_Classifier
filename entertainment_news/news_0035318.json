A couple of Geneva police officers also were present as visitors arrived.\n\"I wanted to create a forum for people to consider Jeb as the next president of the United States,\" Gerard Keating said before the candidate's arrival.\nKeating, president and CEO of Keating Resources LLC, in Geneva, described himself as a fifth-generation American entrepreneur who invests primarily in real estate, notably agriculture and industrial.\nKeating said the response from those willing to shell-out the $250 to $1,000 to meet Bush was \"overwhelmingly positive.\" He expected more than 100 people to attend.\nKeating planned for his daughter, Reese, 9, and son Alec, 17, and their friends to meet the candidate. Keating invited his son's Geneva High School varsity football team meet with Bush.\n\"These kids are going to be voting for the first time next fall,\" Keating said.\nThe historic limestone house was formerly owned by prominent local businessman Henry Bond Fargo. Fargo came from New York and was a fourth cousin once removed of William George Fargo - one of the founders of Wells Fargo and Company. Fargo came to Geneva in 1887.\nAmong the guests was former state Rep. Tom Cross, R-Oswego. Cross won his party's nomination for the seat of Illinois treasurer in 2014 but then lost in the general election. Cross said he is a supporter of Bush and a co-chairman for his campaign in Illinois.\nDavid Peebles, of Batavia, a self-proclaimed political aficionado, was hoping to get Bush's signature on a photograph of President George H.W. Bush and President George W. Bush standing beside the latest Bush hoping to live in the White House.\n\"I collect political autographs,\" Peebles said.\nLinda Girardi is a freelance reporter.\ntriblocaltips@tribune.com\nTwitter: @TribLocal\nCopyright Â© 2015, Aurora Beacon-News George H.W.
