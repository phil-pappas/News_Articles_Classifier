A doting mom, Sreelekha Mitra says she doesn't know what the future holds and if she should marry again. Right now, she is ready to say `I do', only on screen. Excited about playing the lead in Mayer Biye, the actress lets us in on her life not many are privy to. Excerpts:\nYou think your on-screen character, Aparna Ghosh, in Sudeshna Roy and Abhijit Guha's Mayer Biye is much like you in real...\nWell, to a great extent yes, but I haven't got married for the second time yet (laughs)! On a serious note, whenever I am essaying a character, a lot of Sreelekha Mitra goes into it, not consciously but by default.Aparna has some similarities with me. I am a single mother and I share a great bonding with Maiya (Oishi, my daughter), so does my reel character. Two days in a week my daughter stays with her father and at that time I feel alone though not lonely; I strongly believe there is a difference between the two. In the film too, when Saayoni (she plays my daughter, Puja) gets busy with her friends and studies, Aparna, at times, feels alone.\nDidn't you have a problem playing mom to Saayoni?\nIt was difficult initially , as for the first time I am playing mom to an adult on screen. But after Sudeshnadi narrated the script to me, I felt there was more to the character than being a mom. The script of Mayer Biye is so beautiful that all these will not matter to the audience. Also, I am very particular about choosing my films. I had quit TV because I couldn't cope with the thought of adults calling me, 'Ma, ma, ma'! But here the script is so empowering that I was game. It's not that I hide my age as I feel more content at 40. Now I'm at peace with myself and there is stability in terms of work. Age is actually in the mind. It's not that someone will lust for you if you are 16 and not 40. If you love yourself, why won't others do so? I don't want a man to open the car door for me but I want him to think we are no inferior to them. There are several men who call themselves liberal, but in their heart of hearts, champion chauvinism...\nDetractors say despite looks and talent, you couldn't achieve much because of a major drawback -attitude...\nWho decides if I am successful or not? Success is a relative term. I was very confident when I started out as acting is my sole asset and I score high in that. I am quite updated as I read a lot, so I am not dumb. People say I am not bad to look at, so I don't need to beg for work. I can't go from door to door and say , `Dadago, didigo, amake kaj dao'. What many called PR, is begging to me. When I had no work, even at that time I didn't compromise and stood by what I believed in. I can't talk sugar-coated things. So, if I am considered not-so-successful, be it...\nThere was a time when you played second lead in several commercial films. But today, you stay away from most masala potboilers...\nI played the parallel lead in many films. Then, in Annodata , I was paired opposite Prosenjit Chatterjee, which became the highest grosser that year. So, other than Ashok Dhanuka, producer of the film, I am not indebted to anyone in this indus try . I used to do television at that time and there was a lot of issue over casting me as a heroine as many thought people will not buy tickets to watch a face they can see sit ting in the drawing room. I wonder why I never had an on-screen jodi! Am I too bad looking? How I wanted to dance with romance a hero in a song! Fact is, I could never flirt with people who would give me work or cast me as a heroine. I always thought my work will speak louder than words. No big production house or director can say that Sreelekha asked them for work.\nMayer Biye reminds us of the title Baba Keno Chakor...\nWell, I was part of the successful film, Baba Keno Chakor , and I am proud of that. I can do such films as well as a Choukath . There is a fun element in the title Mayer Biye . If you keep that aside, there is a deeper meaning in these two words. So, there are two ways of looking at it. Like it or hate it, you won't be able to ignore the title.\nDo you think the audience will accept the concept of a daughter getting her mother married?\nWhy not? Times are changing. Earlier, eyebrows would be raised when it came to the word, divorce. Now things are much better. There are real instances of daughters taking the initiative of getting their mothers married. To us a mother is an epitome of sacrifice. We forget that she too is a human being with emotions. The film will wonderfully show that aspect.\nWould you have, as a daughter, taken the initiative of getting your mother married for the second time?\nMy father was dominating in his younger days, while my mother dedicated her life to our well-being. But they are a very lovey-dovey couple now. Had Baba been the way he was before (angry young man), I would surely have got a handsome man for ma.\nWill your daughter take it in good spirit if you get married again?\nWell, she asked me once if I would ever marry someone. I told her I don't know what the future holds. So she asked whether I will change my surname or can she continue to be Oishi Sanyal... I realized that her concern was whether our identity will change if I get married.When I assured her it won't, she was relieved. Maiya is sure no one can come in our way , so her fear of losing me has gone.If I marry anyone, he does not have to be my daughter's father, but can accept her as my daughter. There has to be some amount of respect and love for her.Likewise, Maiya too has to accept him.\nDon't you feel the need of a man in your life?\n(Laughs out loud) After my separation with Shiladitya (Sanyal), I was lonely and thought how to cope with this void as I come from a middle-class family , where I have grown up seeing my parents love each other. As time passed by , I sorted things out and found out means to keep myself busy . Now I know how to prioritize things. So, I am in a comfortable zone. Just the other day , my brother's wife was asking if they should create my profile on a matrimonial site. But I really don't know whether at all I want to get married as I am so happy with my daughter and myself. I do need a man and miss his presence when I go to the market to do the groceries or buy a bottle of beer. More so, when I have to sit with my tax consultant and when my driver doesn't come to work.I have a dozen men to flirt with, but I get bored easily . If they take one step, I know what the tenth step would be. So, I feel, it's a complete waste of time and energy . And physically , nothing is happening for a long time (laughs out loud) though I know men who fantasize me and also the fact that a recent picture of mine in a sari and transparent black blouse went viral. But sorry , the image was photoshopped as I am yet to become so inhibitionless as a person. I was in Japan recently and the hot spring bath is my biggest take back from there. I was shocked when I saw naked women from 5 to 75 taking a bath, but then drop ping my inhibitions when I joined in, I really felt liberated.\nDoes your daughter miss her father?\nShiladitya is a doting father and Maiya enjoys his company . He attends parent teacher meetings too. She is enjoying the best from both her parents. At first my daughter had problems and she asked why we can't stay together like her friends' parents. So, we both made her understand and now she has become way more mature. We live in a society where the pretention level is very high and a couple will stay together despite all odds thinking what others will think. But I can't as I like to live life on my own terms. I am much sorted now, where I work, watch films, read books, help my daughter in her studies, take her out for dinner and so on. I enjoy doing what I do.\nComing to films, where do you feel Tollywood is headed?\nWe need more audiences to catch Bangla films in theatres. And there has to be parity in distribution. Before a film is getting registered in an audience's mind, its timing is changing. So, that has to be taken care of.\nWho are your friends in the industry?\nFriend is a strong word and I value it. I have a college friend who I take for granted and vice versa and I can proudly say she is my friend. Other than that, Rahul, Rupanjana, Bidipta, Raja Dasgupta, Mir are more than acquaintances to me.\nEver been at the receiving end for wearing backless cholis despite not being so thin?\nWho can decide what I will wear? I am comfortable flaunting my beautiful back and I will. I care a damn about who says what!\nHeard your next is a detective film?\nWell talks are on for me to play a detective. Nothing has been finalized yet.\nMayer Biye , produced by Eskay Movies, releases on September 25.
