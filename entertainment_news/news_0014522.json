Minerva Networks has restored the excitement to pay TV subscribers' and operators' user experience (UX) with a modern, single platform solution for all content delivery needs. It helps operators evolve beyond the services enabled by their legacy set-top boxes (STBs) toward a more modern, personalized, over the top (OTT)-like UX. Using this platform, viewers can view content across a range of devices, including Internet protocol television (IPTV)-configured STBs, cable and hybrid STBs, smartphones and tablets, as well as streaming media products.

The Minerva Back Office was developed in response to viewers' desire for a comprehensive platform as well as operators' need for more control and increased monetization schemes. The Minerva Back Office delivers a full OTT STB experience with cloud-based management, and leverages the economic and performance benefits of cloud computing, such as scalability, application diversity and availability.\nMinerva Networks operates like a systems integrator and tailors platforms to a client's specific business needs. The solution is normally licensed per device/household/account, and payments can be made annually or every month on a pay-as-you-go basis.\nMeanwhile, the analytics in Minerva 10 present operators with more granular usage data, which helps identify new revenue streams and design unique content offerings. For users, it combines multiple devices into one unified UX and makes the same content viewable across devices. Minerva Networks customers' personalization schemes and parental controls also work consistently across all devices in a fluid and uninterrupted manner.\n\"Overall, Minerva Networks has developed a software-based platform that transforms STBs to fully functional, modern entertainment platforms that can potentially win back market shares from third-party devices,\" noted Gresham. \"Nearly 290 operators worldwide and 2 million viewers recognize the value proposition of Minerva Network's digital media solution, and their trust bolsters the company's impressive brand equity.\"\nEach year, Frost & Sullivan presents this award to the company that has demonstrated excellence in terms of growth strategy and implementation.
