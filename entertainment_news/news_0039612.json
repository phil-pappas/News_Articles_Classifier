Based on Roald Dahl 's classic children's book, the show centers on a 5-year-old genius whose love of books helps her triumph over her horrid parents and even more horrible school headmistress. The engagingly quirky score by Tim Minchin , a smart book by Dennis Kelly and inspired direction by Matthew Warchus make this an exceptionally clever and distinctive show - and the solid cast puts the production, presented by TUTS at Hobby Center , across with dynamism and feeling. 7:30 p.m. Thursday, 8 p.m. Friday, 2 and 8 p.m. Saturday, 2 and 7:30 p.m. Sunday, 800 Bagby; $30-$100; 713-558-8887, tuts.com .\nEverett Evans\nOne job too many: \"One Man, Two Guvnors\" is pure, unashamedly silly farce. The Alley Theatre is inaugurating its elaborately revamped Hubbard Theatre with Richard Bean's recent London and Broadway hit. No need to keep track of the intentionally convoluted plot about a dopey guy who finds himself working for two different bosses - coincidentally, linked by a murder - and must keep each from finding out about the other. Just arrive in the mood for silliness, and you'll enjoy the nonsensical antics and vigorous physical comedy. Jeffrey Bean is a hoot as the fool with delusions of cool and a knack for getting into jams, and Steven Epp just about steals the show as an ancient waiter with balance problems and a new pacemaker that requires lots of winding. 7:30 p.m. Tuesdays-Thursdays, 8 p.m. Fridays, 2:30 and 8 p.m. Saturdays, 2:30 and 7:30 p.m. Sundays, through Nov. 1; Alley Theatre, 615 Texas; $21-$68; 713-220-5700, alleytheatre.org .\nEverett Evans\nSTAND-UP TOUR: Funny or Die's Oddball Comedy Tour comes to town for the third time. With TV's \"Parks and Recreation\" over, Aziz Ansari has more time for stand-up, and he'll headline. Recent Emmy winner Amy Schumer - whose \" Inside Amy Schumer \" is about the funniest thing on TV these days - also is on the bill with TJ Miller, Amnthony Jeselnik, Nick Kroll and others. 6 p.m. Friday at the Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion, 2005 Lake Robbins, The Woodlands; $29.75-$99.75; 281-363-3300, woodlandscenter.org .\nAndrew Dansby\nROCK 'N' ROLL NEVER DIES: Artist Carlos Hernandez's Day of the Dead Rock Stars exhibit is now in its ninth year, but fortunately, rock 'n' roll fills a pretty big bone yard. This year, Hernandez and artists, including Christopher Wallace , Katy Seals, Sean Starwars and Tom Huck , offer original pieces of art honoring departed musicians, including Jimi Hendrix , Barry White , Jerry Garcia , Link Wray and others. 6 p.m. at Cactus Music, 2110 Portsmouth; free\nAndrew Dansby\nMUSINGS: For close to 40 years, Sterling Smith has been issuing dark, stylistically varied recordings - a lot of atonal blues and folk - from Houston as the mysterious entity Jandek. For about a decade now, he's also started occasionally playing shows with all sorts of instrumental configurations. Local bassist Thomas Helton will be among the players this time. That's about all we know, other than no two Jandek shows are even close to the same: He's done funk and electronic music at previous Houston gigs. 9 p.m. Tuesday at Walter's, 1120 Naylor; $5-$8; waltersdowntown.com .\nAndrew Dansby\nMYSTERIOUS MAGIC TO DO: Mark your calendars. Diane Paulus ' thrilling, circus-themed, Tony-winning revival of the 1972 smash \"Pippin,\" with its much-loved Stephen Schwartz score, hits Houston Tuesday. For sheer exhilaration, few recent Broadway productions can match this ingenious reinvention of the picaresque musical about King Charlemagne 's son Pippin and his quest for a meaningful life. Opens at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday; through Oct. 25; Broadway at the Hobby Center, 800 Bagby; $25-$105; 800-982-2787; broadwayatthehobbycenter.com .\nEverett Evans\nDANCE OFF: Didn't get enough of those \"stage vs. street\" routines on TV? Good news: The 10 finalists of Season 12 of \"So You Think You Can Dance\" aren't done yet. Led by winner Gaby Diaz , now officially America's favorite dancer, they come through town this weekend as part of a whirlwind, 70-city live tour. Former Houston Ballet dancer Jim Nowakowski is among them. 8 p.m. Saturday, Revention Music Center , 520 Texas; $35-$75; 713-230-1600, reventionmusiccenter.com .\nMolly Glentzer", "external_links": ["http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/57/8788956/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/57/8788953/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/14/8729372/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/06/8765885/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/57/8788951/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/57/8788955/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/06/8765885/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/57/8788950/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/57/8788953/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/06/8765886/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/57/8788951/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/57/8788955/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/57/8788952/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/14/8729372/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/57/8788958/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/57/8788957/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/57/8788954/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/57/8788958/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/57/8788952/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/57/8788956/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/57/8788954/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/57/8788957/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/06/8765886/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/57/8788950/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T19:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:47:26.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
