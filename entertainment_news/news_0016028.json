Posted Oct. 14, 2015 at 4:50 PM Updated at 4:52 PM Posted Oct. 14, 2015 at 4:50 PM Updated at 4:52 PM GRANTSBORO | The 11th annual Heritage Day Celebration at the Pamlico County Museum and Visitors Center on Saturday is a chance to step back into yesteryear of a rural county whose traditions are fishing, farming and forestry. The Pamlico County Heritage Association offers a free day at the museum and its Heritage Village, which features a blacksmith shop and an old one-room schoolhouse. Visitors can see farm demonstrations and exhibits depicting the lifestyle of residents during the past century. Demonstrations include shelling corn, milking a cow and washing clothes in an old-timey wash pot over a fire. There will also be a bee-keeping demonstration as well as many exhibits by local service providers. There will be games, music and good food. Bingo, with prizes, has been added to this year’s event for adults and children. The Pamlico County Horseman’s Association will again be on hand to provide supervised horse and pony rides for children. Visitors can also have lunch, with home-cooked barbecue sandwiches and hot dogs. The museum’s extensive genealogy center will be open for family history charts and instructions for beginning genealogical studies. Docents will be available in the museum to answer questions pertaining to more than exhibits on display. The farming, fishing and forestry displays depict the county’s economic bases and other exhibits focus on the family and social life in early Pamlico County. The displays include an early kitchen, “Grandma’s Attic,” a military exhibit, and more. The Heritage Village opens its working blacksmith shop, which area blacksmiths have held workshops on the craft this past summer. The turn-of-the-century one room school house once was located on Kershaw Road. The Heritage Village also includes Mayo Barber Shop, where Barber Ronald Hardison will be doing haircuts. At 3 p.m. the winning raffle tractor ticket will be drawn for the 1947 Farmall Super A tractor. Tickets will be available for purchase. Contact Pat Prescott at 745-2239. The Pamlico County Historical Association was organized and chartered with the State of North Carolina in 1968. It was the end result of a local history study class organized through the Continuing Education Department of what was then Pamlico Technical Institute. The initial class was started by George Peacock, the high school history teacher who was hired as the instructor, and Larry Prescott, director of the evening programs. Through the efforts of Peacock and Prescott and about 20 other residents, the beginning of researching, writing and preserving Pamlico County’s history began. The historical association was formed, initially using an old wing of the Alliance High School as a classroom. Through fundraising and grants from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, along with donated land, the current museum was constructed and opened in August 2009.
