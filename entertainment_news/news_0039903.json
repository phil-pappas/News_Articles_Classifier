Ryan did admit that backup quarterback EJ Manuel would get the majority of the reps Wednesday afternoon in practice, but as far as whether that means Taylor is definitely not available for the game, Ryan isn't saying.\n\"The report that he won't play is news to me,\" Ryan said in reference to a story that Taylor suffered a sprained MCL in his left knee and would likely be out a couple weeks. \"He's not going to be full go today, but he'll be able to do a few things out there. He's beat up, he's still got a little pep in his step, but not how he normally is. He has a little bit of a knee that happened on that one run, but we'll see how he is.\"\nTaylor, who was already playing with an ankle injury, hurt the knee on his game-changing 24-yard scramble in Tennessee. He was horse-collar tackled by Titans linebacker Zach Brown and twisted the knee. He left the game for one play, then came back and led the Bills to the winning touchdown.\n\"He finished the game, made some plays at the end of the game, so I think can he play with it, he's already proven that,\" said Ryan. \"We've got to make sure that (Taylor's) ready to roll and we feel good about it and he's not going to do anything that could damage him and make it a more long term issue.\"\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nFaith in Manuel eased Cassel trade\nRyan: \"If EJ is the quarterback, we have all the faith in the world in him.\"\nâ€” Sal Maiorana (@salmaiorana) October 14, 2015 However, if it really is a sprained MCL, it doesn't seem like the wise move to play Taylor, and Ryan is very likely just trying to string along the Bengals as they begin preparations. Obviously, Manuel would play a different style than Taylor.\nAsked about whether Ryan might be playing games with the Bengals, Cincinnati coach Marvin Lewis, who worked with Ryan in Baltimore, said, \"Good luck to you guys figuring Rex out.\"\nIn the portion of practice that the media is allowed to watch, Taylor was participating on a limited basis. He was with the other quarterbacks - Manuel, newcomer Josh Johnson, and practice squader Dustin Vaughan - at the outset, but they all broke off to do work with quarterbacks coach David Lee, and Taylor stayed with offensive coordinator Greg Roman.\nWhile the other quarterbacks did lateral and rollout drills, Taylor was not seen doing anything other than dropping straight back and handing off.\nThe Bills have come under a little fire, in hindsight of course, for trading away veteran backup quarterback Matt Cassel to Dallas for a fifth-round draft pick. Cassel is apparently in line to become the Cowboys' starter next week, a job he could have assumed in Buffalo.\nRyan certainly isn't looking back on that decision with any regret.\n\"I think EJ did a tremendous job for us in the preseason,\" said Ryan. \"I know there's a lot of criticism out there that we moved Cassel, but we moved Cassel because of EJ and his development. So we'll see. If he has to play, we're very comfortable and confident that he'll do a great job for us.\"\n-- In other news, both Sammy Watkins and LeSean McCoy were on the field doing a portion of the early drills. McCoy was working with a resistance band, testing out the limits of his hamstring.\nAlso, the Bills placied safety Aaron Williams on the injured reserve list, designated for return. Williams reinjured his neck in Tennessee, and Ryan said he was sore. Williams now cannot play for eight weeks. The team announced the signing of Josh Bush to take Williams' roster spot, and Bush was on the practice field. Bush played three games for the Broncos this season. He was a sixth-round pick of the Jets in 2012 when Ryan was the head coach in N\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nTyrod Taylor's late heroics bail out Bills\nTweets by @salmaiorana EJ Manuel (3) warms up before the Dolphins game earlier this year.
