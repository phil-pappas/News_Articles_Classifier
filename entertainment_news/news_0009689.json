Main St. Whitbeck is the author of two critically acclaimed volumes of poetry, “Oregon Sojourn” and “The Taproot Confessions,” as well as “Notes on the History and Literature of the Northern West.” He is a past winner of a C. Hamilton Bailey fellowship from Oregon Literary Arts, as well as The Working People’s Poetry Contest sponsored by Partisan Press. His poetry addresses themes that connect with a wide range of audiences, due in large part to his working class roots. After working as a longshoreman while studying in Germany, and later as a logger and sheepherder in northeastern Oregon, Whitbeck worked a hill farm in Wheeler County, Oregon, in a remote, sparsely populated region east of the Ochoco Mountains. In recent years — until June 2015 — besides his farm work, he had been commuting to work long alternate weeks in the oil fields. Whitbeck’s reading will be followed by Open Mic, where audience members can sign up to read their own original three-minute stories, poems or prose. First Draft is made possible through the support of the Oregon Cultural Trust and contributions from local supporters. For details, call 541-278-9201 or see pendletonarts.org.
