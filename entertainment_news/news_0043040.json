We had just met through passing. We have a mutual friend named Willie T. I had walked up and he was like, 'Yo, take a picture with Rita.' And I was like, 'OK.' \n\"We just took a photo together, but obviously she's stunning and she's awesome.\" \nThe 39-year-old rocker admitted he and Rita, 24 - who wore a black and white cheerleader uniform at the event - only spoke briefly that night, though he was able to introduce his 11-year-old son Landon to her and she left a lasting impression. \nHe added: \"Of course Rita Ora was like the only hot cheerleader at the whole spot, so you couldn't help but notice her.\" bang showbiz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T04:03:12.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
