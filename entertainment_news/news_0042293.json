Kaley Cuoco, famous for being adorable, recognizes a fellow cutie. \nThe $28.5 million-a-year Big Bang Theory star is overflowing with gratitude for her fans' support now that she's splitting from her tennis-player husband, Ryan Sweeting. So she reached back to the early 20th-century story and poetry books by A.A. Milne to express her feelings. \nCuoco, one of Hollywood's two highest-paid actresses, posted a message on her Instagram page, illustrated with a E. H. Shepard drawing and quote from Winnie-the-Pooh , first published in 1926. A photo posted by @normancook on Oct 20, 2015 at 8:48pm PDT \nCuoco said she was \"completely overwhelmed with the outpouring of kindness and support,\" even from people she doesn't know. \n\"I want you to know, I read all your comments and your sweet words have touched me deeply. I'm incredibly grateful for all your love as I start this next chapter in my life,\" she said in the post. \nThe post attracted more than 62,000 likes, many with stay-strong messages from adoring fans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T05:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:30:05.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
