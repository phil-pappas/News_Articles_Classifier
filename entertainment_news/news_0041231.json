(UPI) -- A Wild West gunfight reenactment in Tombstone, Ariz., got a little too realistic when a performer fired off a live round that struck another actor.\nThe Cochise County Sheriff's Office said the Tombstone Vigilantes gunfight reenactment group was putting on a street performance Sunday when group member Tom Carter fired off a live round that struck Ken Curtis in the upper groin area.\nInvestigators said Carter had arrived late for the event and his gun was not inspected to make sure it was loaded with blanks.\nThe sheriff's office said they examined Carter's gun and determined he had fired off five live rounds during the performance. A woman standing in front of the Bird Cage Theater during the reenactment was injured by shrapnel from one of Carter's shots, but she declined medical treatment.\nCurtis was taken to Banner-University Medical Center for surgery to remove the bullet.\nThe Tombstone Vigilantes were ordered by the town's mayor to cease performances until it could be verified that only blank ammunition would be used during the reenactments.\nCopyright 2015 by United Press International Share Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1740289", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1740289&h=VIDEO%3A+Tombstone+reenactor+injured+by+accidental+live+shot", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1740289&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:14:19.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
