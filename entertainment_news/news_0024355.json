The paper says McCartney played the two-hour show at a customer appreciation dinner given by Freightliner Trucks on Sunday. \nMcCartney's wife, Nancy Shevell, is an executive at Elizabeth, New Jersey-based New England Motor Freight, a trucking firm owned by her father. \nMcCartney made other trucking references throughout the show, but his song list was based mostly on his more than 50-year career with the Beatles and solo career.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T17:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:09:29.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
