Yet, over the years, the site at 994 Warren Ave. has seen at least three restaurants come and go.\nThe latest endeavor to occupy that spot, RBK American Grill , may signal a positive shift in the tide. During a recent Thursday evening dinner, this intimate space was bustling; with just about every one of its 56 seats occupied, as well as the six stools at the bar. Not bad for a venue that opened in late July.\nrelated advertisement RBK American Grill\n994 Warren Ave., Downers Grove, (331) 251-6780, rbkdg.com\nCuisine: American bistro\nSetting: Contemporary\nPrices: Appetizers: $6.50-$13; entrees: $13-$29; desserts: $7-$8\nHours: 4 to 9 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday and Sunday; 4 to 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday; closed Monday Named after chef-owner and veteran restaurateur Robert Butterfield, the American bistro has the makings for success: a kitchen capable of turning out well-executed classic dishes, exemplary service and a inviting ambience.\nMy dining partner enjoyed the cushiony comfort of RBK's newly installed banquettes, and we both appreciated the dishtowel-sized cloth napkins, a perfect foil against unexpected food spills.\nRBK's bar stocks a tidy supply of wines and craft beers. In addition, it also prides itself on a repertoire of handmade cocktails.\nMussels in white wine, a farm-stand cheese plate, sushi grade tuna tartare, organic beets and Greek salad are among available starters. For something a bit different, try the tempura asparagus: seven spears lightly battered and quickly deep-fried, served with a delicious lemon-dill vinaigrette and grated Parmesan dressing.\nEntree options feature a choice of two burgers, fried organic chicken, shrimp tacos, steak salad and a veggie mac-and-cheese. Wild salmon also is a menu staple along with a daily fish special.\nThe seared sea scallops with baby shrimp were perfectly seasoned and plated with a delectable avocado-corn relish.\nShort rib fans needn't hesitate to order RBK's version, served with mashed potatoes, skinny green beans and roasted shredded carrots. The meat was so tender that a replacement knife supplied by the waitstaff wasn't pressed into service even once.\nOther options for carnivores include the double-cut pork chop with a roasted butternut squash puree, the prime bistro steak with hand-cut fries, the 28-day aged filet with horseradish mashed potatoes and, at $55 for two diners, a 30-ounce bone-in rib-eye served with buttermilk mashed potatoes and organic greens.\nBetween an appetizer and a main course, one can consume a goodly amount of food. But dessert fanatics (present company included) somehow typically manage to save room for a sweet indulgence.\nOf the five on offer, I tried -- and recommend -- the house-made whipped-cream-topped banana pie, a well-made old-fashioned treat built on an Oreo crust.\nBourbon-pecan bread pudding, farm-stand raspberry pie, flourless double chocolate cake and butterscotch creme brulee were among other temptations vying for attention.\nâ€¢ Restaurant reviews are based on one anonymous visit.
