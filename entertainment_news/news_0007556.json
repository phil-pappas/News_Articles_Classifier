The Mother Monster sports a baby bump while wearing an early 1920s ensemble comprising of a patterned green coat and a long fur stole. The singer styled her hair in platinum blonde curls and covered it with a brown hat featuring green-and-gray detail. She completed her look with a pair of brown leather gloves, black shades and a black handbag. At one point, she's seen making her way to a yellow vintage car. GaGa depicts The Countess, a wealthy socialite who owns the titular hotal on the series. The character's been revealed to be a vampire, so GaGa probably filmed a flashback scene in which her character's still a human. \"AHS: Hotel\" aired its second episode on Wednesday, October 14 and has let fans take a peek into the next installment via a preview shared by FX. In \"Mommy\", \"Alex hits a breaking point when Scarlett brings up memories of Holden and Donovan becomes a target of the Countess' rival.\" Also starring Matthew Bomer , Chloe Sevigny , Angela Bassett and Finn Wittrock among others, the anthology horror will return October 21 on FX at 10.00 P.M. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:10:23.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
