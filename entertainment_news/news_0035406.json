(Phil Noble/PA) \nIn his Instagram post, the father-of-four said: “Words cannot describe how amazing this young lady has been over the years. \n“Kirsty has been defying doctors for many years and whilst doing that she has been raising millions of pounds for terminally ill children… Promoted stories \n“I met Kirsty in 2002 when she became the nations and my good luck charm for the game against Greece, we also met the queen together in Manchester so you could say we have spent some amazing moments together over the years and it was an inspiration to meet such a brave young lady with so much drive for helping others.. \n“My love and thoughts go to Kirsty’s parents and sisters as this inspirational young lady will be missed … My heart and love goes to Kirsty for letting me be a small part of your world over the years.. Rest in peace.” (Phil Noble/PA) \nKirsty also accompanied David to hand over the ceremonial baton as the Queen opened the Commonwealth Games in Manchester in 2002. \nHer condition meant her parents Lynn and Steve, from Wythenshawe, Manchester, were told she would not live past her fourth birthday. \nBut she became a tireless fundraiser, raising more than £7.5 million for Francis House Children’s Hospice in Manchester. \nDuring her short life she also overcame her illness to study childcare at college and became a proud auntie. (Toby Melville/PA) \nAfter battling ill health throughout her life she died in hospital at 1.38am on Saturday with her parents and sisters Zoe and Kim at her bedside at the Manchester Royal Infirmary. \nDavid’s tribute was one of scores from celebrities and VIPs flooding in, including Prime Minister David Cameron, opera star Russell Watson, Coronation Street actors Jennie McAlpine and Antony Cotton. \nMembers of the public added to hundreds of online tributes. PM: Very sad to hear of the death of Kirsty Howard, a truly inspirational young woman whose fundraising efforts will have touched so many \n— UK Prime Minister (@Number10gov) October 24, 2015 \nKirsty became the face of the charity appeal for Francis House Hospice, originally opened by Diana, Princess of Wales in 1991. \nHer charity work raised the funds necessary for the long-term future of its care for terminally-ill children and support for their parents. \nThe Kirsty Club was launched to expand and improve the service and as a lasting legacy to Kirsty’s bravery in battling her health condition while helping the lives of others. (Myung Jung Kim/PA) \nCelebrity supporters of the appeal included Gloria Hunniford, former Harrods owner Mohamed Al-Fayed, Davina McCall and opera singer Russell Watson. \nIn a statement, Francis House hospice said: “Our deepest condolences go to her family. \n“We cannot express enough our humble thanks and gratitude to an incredible young woman.” (John Giles/PA) \nDavid Ireland, chief executive of the hospice, said: “Francis House had struggled to meet its running costs for many years, Kirsty’s fundraising changed that and gave us a measure of security that allowed us to expand and develop our service.
