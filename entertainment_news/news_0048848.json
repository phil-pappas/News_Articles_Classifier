Front-runner Hillary Clinton anchored the stage at Las Vegas' Wynn casino, flanked by Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator leading her in New Hampshire, and former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley. Former Virginia senator Jim Webb and former Rhode Island governor Lincoln Chafee also participated.\nThe forum was an opportunity for Clinton to change the narrative from her use of a private email server to her policy proposals. For Sanders, the challenge was to expand his appeal to minority voters. Underdogs O’Malley, Webb and Chafee were looking to gain any traction in polls.\nUSA TODAY\nClinton punches back at first Democratic debate\nUSA TODAY provided live updates from the debate. Here are the highlights (all times are Eastern):\n10:54: Closing statements begin.\nChafee again highlights his background as a mayor, senator and governor. \"I have had no scandals, and I have high ethical standards,’’ including his vote against the Iraq war. \"I am a proven peacemaker.’’\nWebb: Campaigns include a lot of rhetoric and empty promises. His record shows \"I’ve always been willing’’ to take on complicated and unpopular issues, including criminal justice reform. He cites \"money that is poisoning our political process.’’\nO’Malley: He draws a contrast with Republican debates. \"You didn’t hear anyone denigrate women’’ or make racist comments or speak ill of another American \"because of their religious belief.’’ He cites the need to improve education and to include more people in the nation’s economic prosperity. He talks about the views of people under 30, an indirect reference to his own youth.\nSanders: The U.S. has the highest childhood poverty rate of industrialized nation, high levels of income inequality. \"Nobody up here’’ can address the major crises the nation faces \"unless millions of people begin to stand up to the billionaire class,’’ he said. He makes a fundraising plea for $30 a piece to continue the revolution.\nClinton: She cites her late mother, including \"the best’’ advice she received that it doesn’t matter whether you’re knocked down but whether you get back up. The U.S. is \"standing but not running.’’ Her core commitment will be to raise incomes for middle class families, she says.\n10:47: Sanders is asked how he would compromise with congressional Republicans. \"The only way we can take on the right wing Republicans … is by having millions of people coming together if we want free tuition in public colleges and universities millions of people are going to have to demand it.’’\n10:43: Clinton speaks on mandating paid maternity leave and whether it would discourage businesses from hiring. \"I can remember as a young mother having a baby wake up sick’’ and having to be in court the next day, in a direct appeal to women. She also gets in swipe at Republicans wanting to take away Planned Parenthood funding: \"Big government this, big government that except what they want to impose on the American people,’’ in terms of opposing abortion, she says. Sanders calls it an \"international embarrassment’’ that the U.S. is only advanced nation that doesn’t have paid leave.\n10:33: Clinton is pressed on whether she’s a Washington insider at a time when voters want an outsider. O’Malley: \"Our country needs new leadership to move forward,’’ he says. Clinton: \"I would not ask anyone to vote for me based on my last name’’ she said. \"I have the right combination’’ of what the country needs. \"We can’t afford to have a Republican succeed Barack Obama,’’ she said. Sanders says he’s the only candidate running who is not a billionaire yet has raised significant sums of money.\n10:25 Q: How would they differ from Obama?\nChafee: ``We have to stop these wars,’’ he says. ``I would change our approach to the Middle East.’’ O.Malley would press to separate out the big banks and put in place a ``modern Glass-Steagall.’’ Clinton: ``I think that’s pretty obvious,’’ she said, in that she would be the first woman president. She would also build on his successes, including on health care. Sanders: ``The power of Wall Street’’ and drug companies is so great that the only way is to progress is to ``create a political revolution.’’ Webb: ``Bernie, I don’t think the revolution’s going to come’’ and Congress won’t pay for it. He says he would use executive authority to accomplish more.\nFormer Rhode Island governor Lincoln Chafee (Photo: John Locher, AP)\n10:21 Clinton and Chafee defend their votes in favor of the Patriot Act. ``We always have to keep the balance’’ of civil liberties and security, says Clinton. Sanders voted against it. He says he’d shut down the NSA surveillance program. ``If we are a free country we have to be free,'' says Sanders.\n10:13 Discussion turns to immigration. Sanders is pressed on his past vote against increasing guest workers. ``I didn’t leave anybody at the altar,’’ he said, citing the poor working conditions of many of those workers. He says he wants a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\n10:07 Chafee explains his 1999 vote against Glass-Steagall, which broke up big banks, prompting the moderator to ask him if he knew what he was voting for: ``I just arrived in the Senate,’’ he says. ``That was one of my very first votes.’’\n9:56 Question to Clinton: How can you credibly represent the views of the middle class (given her personal wealth)? She cites her and her husband’s humble beginnings and says everyone should have the same opportunity. ``There is no comparison’’ between the policies of Democrats and Republicans, says Clinton.\nO’Malley draws distinction with Clinton, who does not want to break up the big banks. ``We need to reinstate Glass Steagall and that’s a huge difference’’ on this stage, says O’Malley. Clinton says the problem goes beyond bad banking actors. There needs to be ``a lot of attention’’ to the banks, including breaking them up ``if they pose a risk.’’ Sanders says unequivocally: ``We have got to break them up!''\nDemocratic presidential candidates, from left, Jim Webb, Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, Martin O'Malley and Lincoln Chafee stand on stage during the CNN Democratic presidential debate on Oct. 13, 2015, in Las Vegas. (Photo: John Locher, AP)\n9:53 Clinton takes the discussion beyond criminal justice reform: ``We’ve got to do more about the lives of these children’’ and calls for a ``new New Deal’’ for minorities.\n9:51 Q: Do black lives matter or do all lives matter?\nSanders: ``Black lives matter,’’ he says. ``We need to combat institutional racism from top to bottom.’’ O’Malley: ``Black lives matter and we have a lot of work to do to reform our criminal justice system and to address race relations.’’\n9:48 Sanders brings down the house by agreeing with her: ``The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails,’’ he says. ``Let’s talk about the real issues,’’ he says, to a standing ovation.\n9:46 Clinton gets first question about her private email server and turns it to the Benghazi committee after repeating her defense. ``This committee is basically an arm’’ of the Republican National Committee. ``I am still standing,’’ she says, to applause.\n9:39 Sanders is asked about his conscientious objector status during Vietnam: ``I am not a pacifist,’’ he says, citing his support for action in Afghanistan. ``Yes, I am prepared to take this country into war’’ when necessary, says Sanders.\n9:36 First Benghazi question: Clinton defends Libya invasion and says it prevented genocide without troop losses.\nFormer Virginia senator Jim Webb (Photo: John Locher, AP)\n9:32: Webb complains about lack of airtime.\n9:30 O’Malley says Clinton's support for a no-fly zone in Syria ``would be a mistake’’ because ``you have to enforce it.’’ Clinton responds by citing O’Malley’s endorsement of her in 2008 and says there is ``an opportunity’’ to move toward a political, diplomatic solution.\n9:27 Sanders passes on directly attacking Clinton for her war vote and instead highlights his skepticism from the very beginning. He says he voted to stop ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and does support force under some circumstances. O’Malley says legislators ``got railroaded’’ over the war.\n9:24 Chafee takes jab at Clinton for voting to go to war in Iraq, which he opposed. ``I did my homework.’’\n9:21 Discussion moves to Russia. Clinton on Putin: ``We have to stand up to his bullying’’ and says the U.S. has to make clear it’s not ok to be in Syria bombing. Sanders calls Syria a ``quagmire in a quagmire’’ and says he will make sure the U.S. doesn’t get involved. He calls for a coalition of Arab countries to step up.\n9:18 O’Malley gets in on the gun action, says it’s time to push back against the NRA. He highlights his record on gun control as governor and accuses Sanders of ``pandering to the NRA.’’ Sanders hits back: ``You have not been in the United States Congress,’’ where it's hard to pass legislation, says Sanders.\nBernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton talk before the CNN Democratic presidential debate on Oct. 13, 2015, in Las Vegas. (Photo: David Becker, AP)\n9:12 : Sanders and Clinton duel on guns. Sanders gets question about his voting record on guns, including a vote to shield manufacturers from prosecution. ``This was a broad and complicated bill,’’ he said. Clinton says `no’ to question about whether Bernie is tough enough on guns. On shielding manufacturers: ``It wasn’t that complicated to me,’’ she said of the vote. ``Everyone else has to be accountable but not the gun manufacturers,'' said Clinton.\n9:09 O’Malley defends his record as Maryland governor, including high arrest rates in Baltimore. He says they saved lives, primarily poor and black, and says crime also began to retreat.\n9:08 Chafee once again takes veiled swipe at Clinton: ``I have not changed on the issues,’’ he said. ``You’re looking at a block of granite’’\n9:04 Sanders cites Denmark and Sweden as models for making the nation more socialist and equitable in terms of wealth distribution. Q: You don’t consider yourself a capitalist? Sanders responds by deriding ``casino’’ capitalism.\n9:00 First question is to Clinton about whether she’s inconsistent on the issues. ``I’ve been very consistent throughout the course of my entire life,’’ she says. Question: Are you a progressive or a moderate? ``I don’t take a back seat to anyone’’ when it comes to progressive issues . ``I’m a progressive who likes to get things done.’’\nBernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton and Martin O'Malley take the stage before the CNN Democratic presidential debate. (Photo: John Locher, AP)\n8:58 Clinton introduces herself and says raising wages are at the center of her campaign. We need to do more beyond raising the minimum wage, she says. Highlights tax cuts for middle class families. Only candidate to highlight women’s issues, including paid family leave, and gay rights.\n8:56 Bernie Sanders doesn’t bother with the pleasantries of introducing himself: \"Our campaign finance system is corrupt and is undermining democracy,’’ he says in coming out swinging on the issues. His second big issue is criminal justice reform.\nFormer Maryland governor Martin O'Malley (Photo: John Locher, AP)\n8:54 Martin O’Malley introduces himself and his family, moves quickly to a heavy focus on economic inequality. \"Economic injustice threatens to tear our country apart.’’\n8:51 Jim Webb highlights his considerable foreign policy experience, including his experience in the Senate. ``I’ve spoken about economic fairness and social justice since day one.’’ He highlights his humble beginnings and introduces his children. ``The highest priority will be the working people.’’\n8:49 Lincoln Chafee introduces himself. Says he’s the only candidate who’s been a mayor, U.S. senator and a governor. He opposed Bush tax cuts and the Iraq war. Highlights Rhode Island’s economic record. \"In almost 30 years of public service I’ve had no scandals… and I have high ethical standards,’’ in an early jab, seemingly, at Hillary Clinton.\n8:41: The candidates are on stage as Sheryl Crow kicks things off with the National Anthem.\nHillary Rodham Clinton speaks during the Democratic presidential debate.
