The Jacksonville Jaguars haven’t made the postseason since 2007, the Tennessee Titans since 2008. The Houston Texans have made it twice in franchise history; in 2011 and 2012, when the Patriots embarrassed the varsity jackets off them.\nThe Colts, meanwhile, have missed the playoffs only one season since 2001, the “Suck for Luck” campaign in 2011 that landed quarterback Andrew Luck in Indianapolis’ laps as a natural replacement for Peyton Manning.\nThis year, the Colts’ divisional opponents have but three wins amassed among them. Even with the sad-sack Miami Dolphins to claim, the Patriots’ AFC East rivals have more than double that amount through five weeks of the 2015 NFL season. Last Thursday, the Colts even became the first team in league history to record 16 consecutive wins within the division with a victory over the Texans. Forty-one percent of the Colts’ wins over the last three years have come against AFC South opponents. Indy is only 23-19, including playoffs, against every body else.\nSince the start of the 2013 season, the Patriots are 9-4 within their division, 23-5 (including playoffs) otherwise.\nSo, who’s got the real “tomato cans,” Eddie?\nLuck hasn’t progressed to the point where he can be considered an elite quarterback, and may have already been lapped in that regard by Andy Dalton, of all people. Head coach Chuck Pagano, for all the inspiration his personal battle provides, evokes more of a “yippee” Pete Carroll (circa, 2007) aura than he does Bill Belichick. General manager Ryan Grigson built this year’s edition as if he were looking at a fantasy roster from 2009, adding geriatrics Frank Gore and Andre Johnson to the offensive mix. Owner Jim Irsay…well, where do we possibly begin?.\nThis isn’t exactly like back in 2007, when Peyton Manning and Tom Brady faced off at the old RCA dome with a combined record of 15-0 to that point in early November. The Colts started this year 0-2, should have lost to the lowly Jaguars and Titans, but yet come into their game against the Patriots Sunday night on the rebound at 3-2. The Colts have won all three games by a combined total of 12 points. The Patriots in their four wins? Seventy-three.\nThat shouldn’t be a measuring stick, but the drastic difference pretty much tells us what we already know, and why the days leading up to this one-time hotly-anticipated matchup have been filled with about as much intrigue as an episode of “Family Feud.”\nThe Colts sort of suck. Unfortunately, for them this week, that realization only comes in Indianapolis come January.\nWho they’re picking\nOur roundup of picks for Sunday’s Patriots-Colts game:\nESPN.com : Unanimous Patriots.\nGreg Cote, Miami Herald : Patriots 34, Colts 20. “NFL Week 6 didn’t serve up a clear-cut Game of the Week, but we’re not apologizing for offering unbeaten Patriots at hot (three wins in a row) Colts in a rematch of last season’s AFC Championship Game — the 45-7 Pats rout that tipped off the whole Deflategate mess. I expect Andrew Luck back from injury here to give Indy a fighting chance in this prime-timer. The prospect of a real air show is all around this game, too; you don’t see many 55-point over/unders except on Saturdays. But I also have a tough time seeing the mistake-prone Nags derailing New England. Past have beaten Indy six times in a row by an average margin of 21 points, and look for Tom Brady’s mastery to continue.”\nDon Banks, Sports Illustrated : Patriots 31, Colts 17. “Sure, Tom Brady, this is just another game. Nothing special about Week 6. Whatever you say. But just watch the Patriots’ play-calling in the second half, should they build a lead. Will they pour it on, or pull it back? What do you think? New England’s revenge tour has arrived at its most meaningful stop, and I have no reason to believe the Patriots won’t be trying to make the Colts regret ever bringing up that whole messy ball inflation issue last January. With or without Indy quarterback Andrew Luck at his best, the Colts won’t be able to hang around in this one if they play like they did in just squeaking past AFC South opponents like Tennessee, Jacksonville and Houston the past three weeks. Indy needs to bring its A game, and we haven’t seen it yet this season.”\nPete Prisco, CBS Sports : Patriots 37, Colts 27. “This is Deflategate revenge time for the Patriots. The Colts are the team that called them out. Don’t think the Patriots won’t take that into consideration. Tom Brady will light up the Colts secondary. Even if Andrew Luck plays, and he likely will, the Colts won’t keep up.”\nCBS Sports staff : Seven out of eight pick New England vs. the spread (Indy, plus-7.5). Everybody picks the Pats straight-up.\nPeter Schrager, Foxsports.com : Patriots 38, Colts 20. “The Patriots outscored the Colts 88-29 in two meetings last year, and that was before the Colts tattled on the Patriots about the air pressure in footballs. If you think the Patriots are above making this one personal, you don’t know the Patriots.”\nFoxsports.com staff : All Patriots.\nFiveThirtyEight : Patriots have a 65 percent chance of winning.\nElliot Harrison, NFL.com : Patriots 34, Colts 21. “Andrew Luck is set to make his triumphant return in Indy—but not so much in terms of what you’ll see on the scoreboard. New England has owned the Colts, and while Indy’s players will be pumped about playing the team that ousted them from the playoffs, the defense simply doesn’t have the horses to keep up.\nThe biggest issue? The lack of takeaways. After five games, five forced turnovers won’t cut it for a team that has been careless with the football (12 giveaways). The Patriots are already at plus-five in turnover differential even after having a bye. Tom Brady has been able to make the offense work without taking unnecessary risks downfield. Part of that has been the rise of running Dion Lewis, who is averaging 5 yards per carry and has caught 23 balls this season. That’s tops among AFC running backs.”\nSB Nation staff : New England across the board.\nUSA Today staff : Pats across the board. Six of the seven pick New England as the “Lock of the Week.”\nMike Florio, Pro Football Talk : Patriots 49, Colts 17. “The Colts pulled the pin on the #DeflateGate grenade. The Patriots will say all the right things before the rematch. And then the Patriots will do everything they can to make the Colts regret running their mouths to the league.”\nMichael David Smith, Pro Football Talk : Patriots 31, Colts 10. “The Deflategate rematch will be a blowout like the original Deflategate game. Patriots roll in Indianapolis, with fully inflated footballs.”\nMass Live staff : All Pats. “Oh, hey. Look at that. The Patriots are playing the Colts this season. Has anyone mentioned this yet?”\nJimmy Kempski, PhillyVoice staff : Patriots. “Is Andrew Luck going to play? Is he going to sit? Who cares? The Patri*ts are a juggernaut right now, and the Colts aren’t anywhere near as good a team as many (self included) thought they’d be before the season began. For the second straight week, Tom Brady has reason to stick it to his opponent for personal reasons. Last week, Greg Hardy was yapping about Brady’s wife. This week, Brady may conjure up the Colts tattling on him about deflated footballs during the playoffs last season. I expect the Patri*ts to roll, Luck or no Luck.”\nMichael Hurley, CBS Boston : Patriots (minus-eight). “What in the world is going on with this line? It could be 28 and I’d still feel pretty confident in taking the Patriots. My goodness. Forget all that stuff I said about how great Vegas is. What a joke.”\nGlobe staff : All Pats.\nNeil Greenberg, Washington Post : Patriots, 80 percent. “This was supposed to be quarterback Tom Brady’s first game back from suspension. Instead, he is in command of the 4-0 Patriots with 1,387 yards and 11 touchdowns for a league-leading 121.5 passer rating. Andrew Luck, on the other hand, ranks second to last in the traditional passer rating (65.1) and dead last in ESPN’s Total Quarterback Rating.”\nMan vs. Cat: Man: Patriots (by four touchdowns); Cat: Colts.\nIt says here: Patriots 41, Colts 22 . An anonymous call to Indy Star columnist Gregg Doyel in the wee hours of Monday morning accuses the Patriots of roofying the Gatorade on the Colts sideline.\nEvery time Tom Brady has beaten the Colts\nPrevious -- of -- Next Patriots 44, Colts 13 (11/30/2001): A young Tom Brady’s first NFL start was against the Colts, and while the defense played a central role in the victory (four turnovers, two interceptions returned for touchdowns), Brady didn’t make any major mistakes. He completed 13 of 23 passes for 168 yards. Jim Davis / The Boston Globe Previous -- of -- Next Patriots 38, Colts 17 (10/21/2001): At halftime, the game was all but over, with the Patriots up, 28-6. The Colts had more offensive yards, but the Patriots’ defense held Peyton Manning to just one touchdown. Brady threw for three touchdowns, two to David Patten (pictured). Patten was the first player since Walter Payton to run, throw, and catch a touchdown in the same game. Matthew J. Lee / The Boston Globe Previous -- of -- Next Patriots 38, Colts 34 (11/30/2003): The Patriots entered the game with a 9-2 record. Brady threw two TDs and two interceptions while Manning had four scores and one interception. One crucial play came with 11 seconds left in the first half when Bethel Johnson returned a kick 92 yards to give the Patriots a 14-point lead. Willie McGinnest's goal line stand preserved the Pats' victory. Matthew J. Lee / The Boston Globe Previous -- of -- Next Patriots 24, Colts 14 (01/18/2004): In the AFC Championship game, the Colts had 446 total yards to the Patriots’ 402, but one extra turnover by the Colts helped the Patriots hold on for the win. Manning was 23 of 47 for 237 yards, but threw four interceptions (three to Ty Law). The Patriots went on to defeat the Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl XXXVIII. Matthew J. Lee / The Boston Globe Previous -- of -- Next Patriots 27, Colts 24 (09/09/2004): The rivals opened the 2004 season at Gillette Stadium with the Colts looking for revenge. Indianapolis led by four at halftime, but Brady's two third-quarter touchdowns to David Patten and Daniel Graham (pictured) put the Patriots up for good. Matthew J. Lee / The Boston Globe Previous -- of -- Next Advertisement Previous -- of -- Next Patriots 20, Colts 3 (01/15/2005): For the second year in a row, the Patriots and Colts met in the playoffs, this time in the divisional round. The Pats defense stifled a Peyton Manning offense that scored 49 points in the Wild Card game against Denver. New England had a 15-minute advantage in time of possession. The Patriots went on to win the Super Bowl over the Philadelphia Eagles. Matthew J. Lee / The Boston Globe Previous -- of -- Next Patriots 24, Colts 20 (11/04/2007): The Colts and Patriots both entered with perfect records, and with 704 total yards combined by the teams, it was one of the better games they played. The Colts were up, 20-10, with 10 minutes remaining, but it wasn’t enough. Brady led two touchdown drives, one a pass to Kevin Faulk, and the Patriots went on to an undefeated regular season. Jim Davis / The Boston Globe Previous -- of -- Next Patriots 31, Colts 28 (11/21/2010): The Colts rallied and were pushing toward a tying score late in the fourth quarter in this tight match-up in Foxboro. But safety James Sanders ended the comeback with an interception of a Manning pass on first and 10 from the Patriots 24. Manning led a strong comeback, but fell short to a long-haired Brady. Winslow Townson / AP Previous -- of -- Next Patriots 31, Colts 24 (12/04/11): The Patriots won this contest, which featured a Colts team with Manning sidelined with a neck injury, but not before Indianapolis battled back from a 31-3 deficit in the fourth quarter. Overall the Colts were no match for Brady’s 289 yards and breakout tight end Rob Gronkowski's three touchdowns. Jim Davis Globe Staff Previous -- of -- Next Patriots 59, Colts 24 (11/18/2012): After a decade with Peyton Manning behind center, the Colts had a fresh face at quarterback with No. 1 draft pick Andrew Luck. The Patriots put on a convincing show after falling behind, 14-7, in the first quarter. Tom Brady went 24 of 35 for 331 yards and three touchdowns while Luck only connected on 27 of 50 and was intercepted three times. Jim Davis / The Boston Globe Previous -- of -- Next Advertisement Previous -- of -- Next Patriots 43, Colts 22 (01/11/2014): Patriots running back LeGarrette Blount had a record day with four touchdown runs and 166 yards as the Patriots crushed the Colts, 43-22, in the AFC divisional playoff game at Gillette Stadium sending New England to their third straight AFC Championship game. The Patriots rushed for a team record six touchdowns. Jim Davis / The Boston Globe Previous -- of -- Next Patriots 42, Colts 20 (11/16/2014): In a game that was billed as a battle against two of the league’s elite quarterbacks, it was an unheralded third-string running back that stole the prime time show. Jonas Gray ran for a franchise record four touchdowns to go along with 201 yards in the Patriots thumping of the Colts at Lucas Oil Field. Barry Chin / The Boston Globe Previous -- of -- Next Patriots 45, Colts 7 (01/18/2015): A few weeks later, the Colts traveled to Gillette Stadium for the AFC Championship Game. The Patriots blew the game open with a 21-point third quarter, highlighted by two Tom Brady touchdown passes to tackle Nate Solder and Gronkowski. The Patriots would go on to win their fourth Super Bowl title against the Seattle Seahawks. Maddie Meyer / Getty Images Contact Eric Wilbur at: eric.wilbur@globe.com .
