Like a creeping plague, it takes over your house: piles of fabric stuffed in every corner, drawers overflowing with skeins of yarn, and stacks of scraps you definitely plan to use one day spilling out of every closet. \nMelissa Hoenisch and Ashlie Clark understand the struggle, and they want to help. That’s why they organized their second Central Montana Creative Rendezvous, happening Oct. 9-11 at the Heritage Inn. \n“We’re going to try to do it twice a year,” Hoenisch said, “kind of one in the spring and one in the fall.” \nFor $75, participants get a six-foot table, free snacks and beverages and three days of uninterrupted crafting time. Finish that scrapbook you’ve been putting off. Use up some of that leftover fabric you bought on sale. Create a painting or some jewelry as a gift just in time for the holiday season. Whatever your craft obsession, the rendezvous has a space for you to indulge. \n“We draw pretty much anybody that’s crafty,” said Hoenisch. “You bring your own stuff and you get a table to spread out. It’s a chance to be with other creative people and have a weekend away.” \nThere’s plenty of juice to plug in any machine you might need. Heonisch recalls a lady last year who brought her computer and printer to create digital scrapbooks. \n“A couple gals showed up for one day with a sock machine and they were knitting socks,” Hoenisch said. \nThe rendezvous revs up at 8 a.m. each morning, and Hoenisch says the last event saw some ladies staying up into the wee hours to get their projects done. The weekend wraps up Sunday, Oct. 11, at 4 p.m. \nCan’t make all three days? Don’t sweat it. The cost is reduced to $60 for two days and only $35 for one day. And don’t forget, that price still includes desserts, fruit and veggie trays, dips, snacks, soda, and coffee provided by the event organizers. The Heritage Inn even has a sports bar and restaurant attached so nobody goes hungry. \nFor more information or to register, call Melissa at 406-698-3131.
