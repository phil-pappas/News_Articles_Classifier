They create the bike of their dreams (and yours)\" \nExplaining how the vehicle has been adapted for the sale, Keanu said: \"For Neiman Marcus, we added performance enhancements, so it's got a sportier frame, engine and suspension.\" \nOther fantasy gifts available include a trio of guitars belonging to Steve Miller, Lyle Lovett and ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons, which can be bought for $30,000 each and will be presented to the recipients backstage at the respective musician's gigs. \nAlso up for grabs is a whiskey tasting tour at the Stitzel-Weller Distillery in Louisville, Kentucky, sampling long forgotten and recently rediscovered barrels, an experience which has a price tag of $125,000, while a dream trip to India is listed for $400,000 and a balloon trip to the edge of space can be bought for $90,000.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:45:10.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
