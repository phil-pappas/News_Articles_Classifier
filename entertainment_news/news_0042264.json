The collaboration results in an upbeat country version of the Oscar-winning song. Flatts and Hale are the latest contributor to the October 30 album which has various musicians singing a rendition of beloved Disney songs. Jessie J sings \"Part of Your World\" from \"The Little Mermaid\", Ne-Yo sings \"Friend Like Me\" from \"Aladdin\", Kacey Musgraves sings \"Spoonful of Sugar\" from \"Mary Poppins\" while Jason Derulo sings \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" from \"The Lion King\". Others contributing to the album is Fall Out Boy who gives a pop punk take on \"The Jungle Book\" song \"I Wan'na Be Like You\". Band's Pete Wentz told Rolling Stone, \"I think there is a fearlessness to Disney in moving forward but maintaining the heart of what has made them great. I think we wanted to come up with a song that not only we all loved but would translate and make sense as a Fall Out Boy song.\" Verve Music Group chairman David Foster said in a statement, \"In choosing the artists to appear on We Love Disney, we tried to cover the whole spectrum. I wanted great singers. That's always been my mandate. We set the bar high and everyone who came in absolutely killed it. The vocals on this album are spectacular.\" Ariana Grande in particular picked her own cover, \"Zero to Hero\" from \"Hercules\" because she relates to it as a child. \"Let It Go\" is originally performed by Idina Menzel . It reached the top five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and won both the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2014 and the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media in 2015. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:46:03.442+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
