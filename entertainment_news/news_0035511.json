And who could be joining him? Is former Dragon Duncan Bannatyne heading to the I'm A Celeb jungle? And who could be joining him? \nPress Association 2014 / / National Entertainment News Share \nFormer Dragon’s Den star Duncan Bannatyne is the latest famous face rumoured to be heading into the jungle for the next series of I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! \nThe businessman, 66, who said “I’m Out” on the BBC show last year, is set to take his girlfriend Nigora Whitehorn, 35, to Australia with him when he takes part in the ITV show, The Sun reported. \nAccording to the newspaper, a show insider revealed: “Duncan is really excited about I’m A Celebrity and sees it as a new challenge after Dragon’s Den. (Ian West/PA) \n“He and Nigora are madly in love and he cannot wait for her and some of his children to join him out in Australia.” \nITV has yet to confirm the line-up for the hit show, hosted by Ant and Dec, when it returns later this year. \nBut a number of stars have already been linked to the series. Here’s who could be joining tough-talking entreprenuer Duncan in the Oz camp. Vicky Pattison (Jonathan Brady/PA) \nAccording to reports, the Geordie Shore star has signed up for this year’s show. \nThe 27-year-old beauty would certainly bring some glamour, and maybe a few fireworks to the camp. Watch out for those jungle shower bikini moments… Promoted stories Paul Gascoigne (Stefan Rousseau/PA) \nGazza would certainly create a stir in the jungle camp. The football legend’s ups and downs have been well-documented in the media, as he has battled mental health problems and alcohol addiction. \nHe is still much loved and has recently been pictured looking healthy after kicking the booze. Maybe it’s his time to shine in the jungle. James Arthur (Abraham Caro Marin/AP) \nThe former X Factor winner found fame hard to deal with after his success on the ITV show, and he was eventually dropped from Simon Cowell’s Syco record label. \nMaybe a jungle stay will help get his music career back on track. Jake Wood Jake Wood (Dominic Lipinski/PA) \nHaving taken part in Strictly Come Dancing and shown off his sneaky snake hips, the EastEnders actor – who is taking a year-long break from the BBC soap after eight years of playing Max Branning – has expressed his keenness to participate in another reality show. \nHe told Radio Times in August: “I do really like that show. Everyone I’ve spoken to who’s done it has said they really enjoyed it. I’m not squeamish – so eating strange stuff wouldn’t bother me. \n“It would be a good holiday for the family as well, wouldn’t it? And the money would be nice. But I think the main appeal is that it’s a different kind of experience.” Dappy Contostavlos Dappy (Andrew Matthews/PA) \nHaving been through some court troubles, N-Dubz rapper Dappy has said he would be up for the jungle challenge, following his successful stint on Celebrity Big Brother in 2014, where he came second. \nHe told Sheffield radio station Hallam FM in July: “I seriously wouldn’t mind going on Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here. As long as people take me serious as a musician, that’s all it comes down to.” Spencer Matthews Spencer Matthews (Yui Mok/PA) \nThe Made In Chelsea star is rumoured to be in “advanced talks” to enter the jungle, according to the Sun. \nA source said: “This deal has been in the offing for a while now as ITV think Spencer will be absolutely perfect for the show. \n“He couldn’t do it last year for various reasons, but everything’s fallen into place and he is going to be on the next series.” Leslie Ash Leslie Ash (Ian West/PA) \nThe Men Behaving Badly, Holby City and Where The Heart Is actress has had a tough time of late, after suffering various health issues.
