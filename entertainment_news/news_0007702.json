And having done that, I retained that conviction until such time as it was pointed out to me that this wasn’t the case. I’m human. I’m fallible. I made a mistake and as soon as I knew I made sure that the record was corrected.”\nWhen pushed by host Emma Alberici on why his office tuned down that cheque but did choose to accept donations from the Randwick Labor Club, Mr Garrett said, “The expectation is that the club will provide money and donate to both the federal members’ and state members’ campaigns. That happened and I’ve always been upfront about that.”\nBut when he later became aware of just how much money the Randwick club derived from pokies, he said he declined to take any further donations from them.\nPeter Garrett performing in 1991 with Midnight Oil. Source: HeraldSun\nIn a wideranging interview to coincide with launch of his autobiography Big Blue Sky , Mr Garrett also said some of his fans weren’t happy about his move into politics,\n“Some were cranky,” he said.\nBut he defended the move. “I’ve got a conviction about Australia and it’s one which has seen me get involved in issues, even when I was in Midnight Oil. But [the band had] reached a point where we’d said a lot of things that we wanted to say and it was time to try something new.”\nMr Garrett was environment minister in the first Rudd government, and education minister under Julia Gillard’s prime ministership.\nHe was involved in the pink batts scandal which saw four people killed while installing home insulation under a botched government program.\nBut he says another regret about his time in politics was that achievements such as the National Disability Insurance Scheme, National Broadband Network and Gonski education reforms — were overlooked because of the continued leadership squabbles.\nA large part of the blame of that, he laid at the foot of Mr Rudd whose behaviour when Gillard was in power, “was appalling and it was destructive,” Garrett told Ms Alberici.\n“He effectively tore down a leader of the Labor Party, someone I had a great deal of respect for.”\nDuring Julia Gillard’s prime ministership, Peter Garrett, in his role as Education Minister, was part of the ‘Gonski’ schools funding program. Source: News Corp Australia\nDuring the writing of his autobiography, Mr Garrett said his thoughts would often turn to music.\n“I’d get to 4 o’clock or 5 o’clock, then felt the guitar sort of calling me — and this probably causes the horror to my Oils colleagues to think that I’m finally picking it up — but it’s some 10 or 15 years since I’d felt music at all.\n“I thought, ‘Well, I’ll take this sweet moment while it’s there,’ who knows where it will end up?”\nWould he record any of the songs? “I might have a go at it. Just to honour them in some ways and to get more of that out of my system as well.”\nOriginally published as Garrett: ‘I’m human, I’m fallible’ Increase Text Size Decrease Text Size Print Email Share Add to Digg Add to del.icio.us Add to Facebook Add to Kwoff Add to Myspace Add to Newsvine What are these?
