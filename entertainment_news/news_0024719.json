(AP) â€” Tufts University says it has rescinded an honorary doctor of arts degree it gave to Bill Cosby a decade and a half ago.\nThe university's board of trustees says in a statement it decided to withdraw the honor after concluding there was \"a substantial basis\" to discredit the accomplishments Cosby was recognized for in 2000.\nCourt documents unsealed in July show the 78-year-old Cosby admitting extramarital relationships with several women, some of whom accuse him of sexual assault.\nCosby has never been charged with a crime.\nTufts President Anthony Monaco said Thursday that Cosby has shown \"a lack of character and integrity\" that does not represent the school's values.\nTufts said it's also withdrawing an award given to Cosby in 2011 for excellence in children's media.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-15T19:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:30:30.425+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
