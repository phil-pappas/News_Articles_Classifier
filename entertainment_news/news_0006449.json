Club named the film the Best of the 2000s.\nSteve Carrell in \"Foxcatcher\"\nCharles Sykes/Charles Sykes/Invision/AP Steve Carrell's gone dramatic for films like \"Foxcatcher\" and \"Freeheld.\" Carrell has since gone further into dramatic performances, and some would argue his role in \"The Office\" is deeply sad, but this is his most notable laugh-free role to date.\nBased on a true story, Carrell plays a philanthropist and wrestling coach who trains two brothers for the World Championships.\nThe role is decidedly darker than most of Carrell's prior fare, but he was rewarded with an Academy Award nomination for his performance.\nBen Stiller in \"Greenberg\"\nStiller is best known for being the straight man in the midst of all the crazies in most of his comedy roles, so it's not surprising to see him occasionally take the turn for drama. Think “Permanent Midnight.”\nBut in this still somewhat-funny Noah Baumbach dramedy, Stiller plays a disaffected man who returns to Los Angeles from New York to house sit for his brother.\nStiller was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for the role.\nEddie Murphy in \"Dreamgirls\"\nJOSHUA ROBERTS/REUTERS Eddie Murphy won a Golden Globe for \"Dreamgirls.\" Many thought Murphy would win the Oscar for this role, and that it was one of his comedies that hurt him in the process.\nIn this musical, Murphy plays James (Thunder) Early, a performer who has an affair with one of the members of the girl group the film focuses on, who eventually falls into depression and drug abuse as his star fades.\nMurphy won a Golden Globe for his portrayal of Early, but lost the Oscar, with many suspecting that his broad comedy film, \"Norbit,\" which came out shortly after \"Dreamgirls\" hurt his chances.\nJennifer Aniston in \"Cake\"\nWhile not a comedian, Aniston is primarily known for comedy on both television (\"Friends\") and in film (\"Office Space\" and \"Horrible Bosses\").\nIn this drama, Aniston plays a woman looking to come to terms with the death of her son and a friend.\nAniston was nominated for a Golden Globe for the role.\nAdam Sandler in \"Punch Drunk Love\"\nJemal Countess/Getty Images When Adam Sandler strays from comedy, the critics tend to love it. Paul Thomas Anderson often uses funny people in his films, and the typically slapstick Sandler might be the best example.\nSandler plays a troubled man who falls in love while dealing with being blackmailed.\nThe \"Jack and Jill\" star scored a Golden Globe nomination for his performance.\nBill Murray in, well, most of his films\nLUCAS JACKSON/REUTERS Perhaps no comedic actor has transitioned better to drama than Bill Murray. The \"SNL\" alum used the Wes Anderson comedy, \"Rushmore\" to transition into a second phase of his career where he largely played sad, aging men in more subtle, dramatic films.\nHis parts in further Anderson films have ranged from funny (\"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou\") to depressing (\"The Royal Tenenbaums\") and other films like \"Lost in Translation,\" \"Hyde Park on Hudson,\" and \"St. Vincent\" have traversed this range.\nMike Myers in \"Inglorious Basterds\"\nMost of Quentin Tarantino's film do the opposite of this list, in making typically stoic, dramatic actors look funny and cool.\nHowever, the \"Austin Powers\" star's brief turn in a British general in Tarantino's rewriting of World Warr II history his mostly straight-laced.\nMartin Short in \"Inherent Vice\"\nAs with \"Punch Drunk Love,\" Paul Thomas Anderson uses a big comedy star's persona to his advantage in this stoner mystery.\nShort plays a drug-addled dentist who leads James Brolin's character further on the run from a corrupt police force.\nslepore@nydailynews.com\nTags: news break , lists , jim carrey , steve carrell , ben stiller , eddie murphy , jennifer aniston , adam sandler , bill murray , mike myers , martin short", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/DjV2GXxrEMI", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/a2EpsuF6w2k", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/OUZgOQ186-A", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/NTmlNigifSI", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/P3IsUOSHlnU"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:39:27.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
