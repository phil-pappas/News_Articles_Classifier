Rahman has lent his Midas touch to the music album of the Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone starrer.\n\nMohit Chauhan \n\"I have sung a song in 'Tamasha'. It's a beautiful song and he (Rahman) has created magic in the songs of the film, as he does every time,\" Mohit said on the sidelines of a song recording for the film 'Once Upon A Time In Bihar'.\nChauhan, whose first brush with success came with the song 'Dooba Dooba' from the band Silk Route's album \"Boondein\", became the voice of Ranbir's character in \"Rockstar\", which was helmed by Imtiaz Ali, who's also directing 'Tamasha'.\nRahman was also the common link in 'Rockstar'. But Mohit Chauhan says 'Rockstar' was a different story.\n\"It was a narration of a singer's life, so it had to be one voice. But in 'Tamasha', I have only one song. I hope when song of 'Tamasha' will come, audience will like it,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:01:49.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
