Atlanta attorney Jamila Hall, who is not associated with the case, believes it's sealed because of its impact on the district attorney's criminal investigation into how Brown died.\n“The outcome of the criminal investigation could be quite helpful to Nick Gordon in the civil case and it could also hurt him. It all depends on what comes out,” Hall said.\nIn addition to mentioning possible danger to witnesses, the order to seal Brown’s autopsy also talks about the integrity of the investigation and the risk defendants may flee.\nThe Facebook post by Leolah Brown doesn’t indicate what exactly she plans to release or if it’s related to Gordon.\n“I feel like I am out here alone fighting for Bobbi Kriss & Whitney,” Leolah Brown said in the post. “Hold on to your seats as I expose some really terrible things.”\nBobbi Kristina Brown was Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown's only child.\nSo far, no one has been charged in Brown’s death. An initial autopsy found no obvious cause of death.\nBobbi Kristina was buried next to her mother, Whitney Houston, after memorial services in the Atlanta area and in New Jersey.\nFB friends,Please get prepared for the truth to be revealed! I am hurting so badly right now for the death of my niece...\nPosted by Leolah PrayerWorks on Thursday, October 15, 2015", "external_links": ["http://www.wsbtv.com/news/news/local/initial-autopsy-shows-no-obvious-cause-death-bobbi/nm7Z8/", "http://www.wsbtv.com/news/news/local/lawsuit-seeks-10-million-against-nick-gordon-alleg/nmkWB/", "https://www.facebook.com/leolahb/posts/10206891342555190", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/news/documents/2015/08/07/Amended_Complaint.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:00:44.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
