Cole and Kanye West.\n\"Some people may have heard of him,\" Carter's attorney, Andrew Bart, said of West.\n\"One or two,\" Carter responded. \"He's running for president.\"\nThe rapper was more serious when questioned about the rights to \"Khosara Khosara,\" which he said he thought had been properly negotiated after issues were raised following the release of \"Big Pimpin'.\"\nCarter gave mostly curt answers, responding \"yes\" or \"no\" or \"correct\" to many questions.\nLawyers for Carter and Timbaland, whose real name is Timothy Mosley, told jurors on Tuesday that Hamdi's family had been repeatedly paid for the use of \"Khosara Khosara.\" Four notes from the song's 74 notes are reapeated throughout \"Big Pimpin',\" a music expert testified Wednesday.\nCarter said Mosley introduced the \"Khosara Khosara\" melody to him just as he was about to leave a meeting. He said there wasn't anything like it on the radio at the time, and he put together the bulk of the song over the next few hours.\nThe rapper said he likes working with Timbaland because they push each other.\n\"He tells me his beats are better than my raps. I tell him my raps are better than his beats,\" Carter said. \"It's an ongoing thing that I keep winning.\"\nMosley and many in the courtroom laughed.\nCarter sang the producer's praises, calling him a genius whose work transcends any one genre.\nMosley later told the jury that he had the majority of the beat compiled when he added in the flute music from \"Khosara Khosara.\" He said he paid $100,000 to settle a claim about the music after \"Big Pimpin'\" was released and was relying on representations from his lawyers that he had valid rights.\nHe provided jurors a brief demonstration of his creative process, standing at a keyboard and creating a new beat and \"beatboxing,\" which he described as making music with his mouth.\nHe denied that the \"Khosara Khosara\" elements were a major part of what made \"Big Pimpin'\" a hit, saying it was his music that was key to its success.\nRoss has accused Carter of lacing vulgar lyrics over Hamdi's beautiful melody without receiving the proper permission, although \"Big Pimpin's\" lyrics are not an issue in the case.\nCarter declined to say Wednesday that the song, which is about leading a promiscuous lifestyle, was vulgar. He said the song featured \"adult lyrics\" and he still enjoyed performing it.\n\"I like the song,\" Carter said. \"It's pretty good.\"\n___\nThis story has been corrected to reflect the proper spelling of Mosley's name.\n___\nAnthony McCartney can be reached at http://twitter.com/mccartneyAP \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
