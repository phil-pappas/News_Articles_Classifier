This is Jeff Wolfe's second directorial endeavor, the first being Penance with Revolution star David Lyon's as the lead. Day of Reckoning will confront the pervasive issue of sexual assault against women and the lack of any kind of justice and closure it leaves in its wake. Wolfe has co-written the piece with Danielle Argyros who will star in the lead role. The film is being produced by Argyros' production company Silver Guardian Productions with her partner Courtney Stewart. Through the film, Wolfe and his team hope to build a powerful awareness campaign around the issue of sexual assault in support of women finding their voice. Donors can make their way over to Kickstarter with the link below to make a donation and bring this worthy project to life.
