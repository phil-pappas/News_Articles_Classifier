But despite vowing to do everything he could to impress new Sabres coach Dan Bylsma, his tryout came to an end on Friday. Slowed by a lower-body injury for much of camp, Kaleta now will join the Amerks.\nWhen he is able to play, however, isn't known. Kaleta skated just three shifts in Thursday's NHL preseason game at Minnesota before leaving with what is believed to be an issue with his knee.\nBylsma said \"this is not the first time Pat's had this injury and these circumstances,\" according to a report from John Vogl of The Buffalo News.\nBylsma said Kaleta had not been experiencing any pain until the game Thursday.\n\"It was a surprise to see it happen again so soon, considering his past history and considering he knew exactly where he knew he was at with it before and now,\" Bylsma said in the blog by Vogl.\nFour other forwards also were assigned to the Amerks: veteran winger/center Matt Ellis, third-year center Tim Schaller, rookie winger Evan Rodrigues, second-year winger William Carrier. So, too, was goalie Nathan Lieuwen, and defensemen Chad Ruhwedel and Jerome Leduc will join the Amerks if or when they clear waivers at noon Saturday.\nMore moves will be made before the Sabres open the NHL season at the First Niagara Center on Oct. 8 against the Ottawa Senators. Buffalo still has 30 players in camp (16 forwards, 11 defensemen and 3 goalies).\nThe list of forwards includes Cody McCormick, who can't pass his medical exam due to a blood-clot issue that he suffered last season. The most likely forwards to come to the Amerks: right winger Jason Akeson and center Cal O'Reilly.\nThe Sabres may reassign just one defenseman until Zach Bogosian is healthy. He may very well miss the opener due to a lower-body injury. Bobby Sanguinetti still hasn't skated. Jake McCabe can come to the Amerks without waivers. Matt Donovan, who is likely outside the top seven on the depth chart, must go through waivers.\nBuffalo's goaltending situation is set with Robin Lehner and Chad Johnson. The third in camp, rookie Linus Ullmark, is coming off surgery on both hips and November had been the projected time for a return.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T18:40:14.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
