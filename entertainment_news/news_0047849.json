The feature permits the program attributes of an event to be uniformly applied as desired to other occurrences of that event throughout a schedule. In installations where a central control staff maintains many stations, the program defaults may also be applied to events on the schedules of other channels.\nThe second new feature, the Change Date, is a dedicated field used for electively recording the date a change to an event was saved and put into effect. The addition of the Change Date attribute frees a Custom field for other use when performing schedule maintenance tasks.\nThe Change Date attribute may be displayed in the site's grid to easily locate the date of an event's latest change. Clients who use MediaStarâ€™s Distribution feature may choose the Change Date attribute when selecting events to distribute to other schedules. The Change Date may also be used as a criteria in the schedule grid's Search function.\nWhen creating a report, Change Date may be chosen as an event attribute to display in the report. It may also be used as a filter criteria when selecting events to include in the report.\nIn addition to the dedicated Change Notes attribute, Change Notes and Event Comments fields are also available in the event form for entering and maintaining additional information about the changes made to an event.\n\"We are constantly working to add value to MediaStar. These latest updates are prime examples of our efforts to enhance our clients' experience and allow them to work more efficiently,\" says Heidi Steffen, SVP, Licensed Application Sales. \"We listen very closely to the feedback we receive from our clients.
