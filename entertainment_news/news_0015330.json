Isn't that lovely? The book is full of such plain, profound observations.\nAt the heart of each essay is the way in which our hair shapes and alters the world's reaction to us.\nWe learn about the pressure within the Satmar Hasidic community for women to adopt a uniform appearance, including a ritual head-shaving after their wedding day.\n\"Failure to blend in is probably the most egregious social crime one can commit,\" writes Deborah Feldman in her essay, \"The Cutoff,\" which explores her childhood raised in a Hasidic Jewish home, her parents' divorce, her marriage and her eventual rejection of her culture's demands.\nWe follow Alex Kuczynski through Istanbul and Syria, where Islamic teachings often deem pubic and underarm hair unclean, and into American pop culture, where Kuczynski explores the unlikely intersection of religious dogma and pornography.\n\"I often reflect on the paradox of the American woman, influenced by porn-star culture, stripping off her pubic hair, coerced into a state of enforced genital infancy, and her similarity to Muslim women all over the world,\" Kuczynski writes. \"They spend their entire adult lives never seeing a pubic hair on their bodies -- but in their case, it is for religious reasons. In one culture, porn rules; in the other, God. The result is the same.\"\nWe listen in as Lamott bravely and hilariously recounts her evolution toward her trademark dreadlocks after years spent battling her natural curl.\n\"Can you imagine the hopelessness of trying to live a spiritual life when you're secretly looking up at the skies not for illumination or direction but to gauge, miserably, the odds of rain?\" she writes. \"Can you imagine how discouraging it was for me to live in fear of weather, of drizzle or downpour? Because Christianity is about water. ... It's about baptism, for God's sake.\"\nThe funniest essay comes from author and screenwriter Adriana Trigiani, who described her childhood mane thusly: \"I got my father's hair, tight curls and fine texture, as if B.B. King and Louis Prima had a baby.\"\n\"I was the only girl in my ninth-grade class who looked 53,\" she writes.\nIf the book has a weakness, it's that reading two dozen essays in a row about hair can become monotonous. Each installment is powerful in its own right, but the phrases and truths that would land and linger on your consciousness if you read them solo, begin to run together when gathered as a group.\nStill, it's a deliciously enlightening read, equal parts fun and poignant.\n\"I've never figured out how to tell the story of my life,\" Rebecca Goldstein writes in the opening line of her essay. \"But I do think I can tell you the story of my hair.\"\nAnd, as Benedict promised, we learn that the two are not really so different from one another.\n(c)2015 Chicago Tribune\nVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/books/booksnews/s-1734070&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/books/booksnews/s-1734070", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/books/booksnews/s-1734070&h=%27Me%2C+My+Hair+and+I%27+addresses+women%27s+complex+relationship+with+hair"], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:20:08.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
