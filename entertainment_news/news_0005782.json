A five-cylinder engine is longer and more expensive to manufacture than a comparable four-cylinder engine, but some manufacturers felt these costs were outweighed by its greater capacity in a smaller space than a six-cylinder. From a driving experience, five-cylinder engines have the best aspects of four and six cylinder engines. They generate more power and torque than four cylinder engines, while maintaining the fuel economy and “pep” of smaller four cylinder engines. Five cylinder turbos have been used on more than one occasion in sport and racing applications. Here are 5 Cool 5 Cylinder Cars, in no particular order. Land Rover Defender \nThe Land Rover Defender (initially called the Land Rover Ninety and Land Rover One Ten ) is a British four-wheel-drive off-road utility vehicle developed from the original Land Rover Series launched in 1948. Used by farmers and enthusiasts for years, sadly in October 2013 Land Rover announced that production would end in December 2015, after a continuous run of 67 years. \nIn 1999 Land Rover started using the TD5 diesel engine: \nEngine: 2.5 L, five-cylinder turbo diesel Power: 122 hp @ 4,200 rpm and 300 lb ft Transmission: Five-speed manual, all wheel drive 0-60: 17.9 seconds Top Speed: 80 mph Ford Focus RS \nThe 2nd gen Focus RS (alas we didn’t get either here in the US) RS used a modified Volvo -engineered 2.5 liter five-cylinder engine found in the Focus ST (which we also didn’t get). A larger Borg Warner K16 turbo delivered up to 20.3-psi of boost, exactly double that of the 225-hp ST’s engine. \nFun Fact: There was an RS500 with 345 hp \nEngine: 2.5 L, 20 valve five-cylinder turbo Power: 301 hp @ 6,500 rpm, 324 lb ft @ 2,300-4,500 rpm Transmission: Six-speed manual, front-wheel drive 0-60: 5.7 seconds Top Speed: 164 mph Audi Sport Quattro \nThe Sport Quattro was derived from the Quattro, and was built solely for rallying. It took advantage of the new FIA Group B regulation, which required manufacturers to only have to build 200 cars for homologation. The racing version of Sport Quattro was the most powerful car in world rally history. Its engine produced in excess of 500 horsepower and eventually 600 horsepower in later version S1. \nEngine: 2.1 L, 20 valve five-cylinder turbo with aluminum block Power: 306 hp and 258 lb ft Transmission: Five speed manual, all wheel drive 0-60: 4.8 seconds Top Speed: 155 mph Volvo 850R \nVolvo introduced a limited-edition high-performance 850. Sold in 1995 only, the T-5R took the regular 850 Turbo and turned it up a few notches, gave it sportier suspension and a more aggressive tune that upped the power output from 220 hp to 240 hp. It was the fastest way to get your kids to school. \nEngine: 2.3L DOHC 20-valve turbocharged inline-5 Power: 240 hp @ 5,400 rpm, 220 lb ft @ 2,100 rpm Transmission: Four speed automatic, front wheel drive 0-60: 7.0 seconds Top Speed: 155 mph Audi TT RS \nWhen Audi were looking for an engine for the TT RS they decided to use 5 cylinder block that had done stirling duty in the US spec base Jetta for years. Audi breathed on it , by adding turbocharging and some other goodies and produced one of the finest sports cars it has ever made. The exhaust note that it produced would send chills up you spine, with its deep, throaty growl. There is a new one waiting in the wings with more power \nEngine: 2.5 L turbocharged 20-valve inline-5, iron block and aluminum head, direct fuel injection Power: 360 hp @ 6700 rpm and 343 lb-ft @ 1650 rpm Transmission: 6-speed manual, 4 wheel drive 0-60: 4.0 seconds", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:37:05.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
