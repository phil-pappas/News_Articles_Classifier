It could be six months or more for rehab and all that. We don't know what state his kidneys and lungs are going to be in.\" \nAnd Lamar is also said to be determined to get better for his estranged wife Khloe Kardashian, 31, after she rushed to his hospital bedside and called off their divorce. \nThe insider added: \"Khloe has been highly encouraged by his motivation to overcome the hurdle of knowing he has a long battle of rehabilitation ahead. He's determined to get better for himself, for Khloe and for everyone else who has shown him love and support.\" brothel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:25:35.208+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
