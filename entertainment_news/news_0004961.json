The boy with the clock met with a ticking time bomb.\nAhmed Mohamed, the 14-year-old Texas high school student who was arrested after bringing a homemade clock to school, met with this week with Sudan president Omar al-Bashir, an accused mass murderer.\nThe controversial meeting took place on Wednesday at the presidential compound in country's capital of Khartoum, according to the Sudan Tribune .\nal-Bashir has been accused of massive war crimes in Darfur, and his country sheltered Osama Bin Laden for five years in the '90s, the Washington Post reported .\nIn addition, there has been bad blood between Ahmed's family and the Sudan president for years.\nThe teen's father, Mohamed Hassan al-Sufi, is a Sudanese immigrant and a former presidential candidate who ran against al-Bashir. Hassan claimed that the National Elections Commission and Bashir's National Congress Party kept him from running in the election five years ago.\n/AP Ahmed Mohamed was arrested after bringing this homemade clock to his Texas high school. \"I was told that Bashir personally intervened with the [appeals] court to reject my challenge,\" Hassan told the Sudan Tribune five years ago. \"The NCP wanted the elections on time and refused any requests for rescheduling. We heard the president [Bashir] threatening to torture any foreign observer talking about postponing the elections. Bashir got it his way.\"\nAhmed's father ran again for office earlier this year, and finished fourth, but his camp said the election was \"rigged,\" according to the Washington Post.\nWith the ill feelings apparently behind him, Hassan joined his son in meeting President al-Bashir on Wednesday. Ahmed told the Sudan Tribune that he was \"extremely delighted\" to meet with the Sudan president, and that he hopes to meet him again \"with a new invention and success.\"\nAhmed drew national attention when he was escorted out of his high school last month in handcuffs after school officials confused his clock for a bomb. President Obama invited him to Washington and he is slated to visit the White House on Monday, the Dallas Morning News reported .\ndboroff@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories Ahmed Mohamed could have been 'head of a gang': teacher Texas family withdraws teen clockmaker from school district", "external_links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/10/16/the-american-boy-arrested-for-making-a-radio-meets-sudans-president-an-accused-war-criminal/", "http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article56725", "http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/2015/10/ahmed-mohamed-clockmaker-heading-to-dc-for-white-house-visit-and-muslim-gala.html/"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:21:31.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
