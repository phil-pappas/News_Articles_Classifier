Over the past few years, Photoshopped images of \"Future's\" DeLorean time machine have popped up on the Web, insisting that TODAY is \"Back to the Future Day.\" And now that the day has actually arrived, there have been countless articles (like, frankly, this one) and videos (like, frankly, the one attached to this story) about what the film and its screenwriter, Bob Gale, got right about 2015. As with other movies dealing with the future, such as \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" (set in the early 2000s) or \"Blade Runner\" (set in 2019, which will be here before you know it), the predictions of \"Back to the Future II\" are hit or miss: big-screen TVs, yes, Mr. Fusion, no; virtual-reality goggles, yes, \"Jaws 19,\" no. Coincidentally, perhaps the most important invention in the film is one behind the scenes: the VistaGlide motion-control system , a computer-operated camera operation that enabled Michael J. Fox to seamlessly share all those scenes with himself. The software was written by an Industrial Light & Magic developer, Bill Tondreau, specifically for the movie and was a milestone in moviemaking technology. Still, it says something about the popularity of the trilogy that here we are, 26 years after the release of \"Back to the Future II\" (and 30 years after \"Back to the Future\"), and we care enough to \"keep score.\" Even \"Back to the Future\" stars Fox and Christopher Lloyd discuss the topic in a new Toyota ad. Yet there's one thing the film hasn't nailed -- yet. According to one of its predictions, the Chicago Cubs win the World Series in 2015 (over Miami, a city that didn't have a baseball team in 1989). As of \"Back to the Future\" Day, those Cubs are in the National League Championship Series, one step short of the big prize. If they do go all the way, perhaps the Chicago-born Zemeckis won't mind a little score-settling. <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01 ad-refresh-adtop\"></div> More from Entertainment", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T13:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:18:42.134+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
