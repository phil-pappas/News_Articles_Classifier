Both men got behind the bar and served drinks to customers, according to a spokesperson for The Lodge.\nApparently Vedder also visited The Lodge in July with fellow Cubs fan Joel Murray (\"Mad Men\") while in town for Cubs president Theo Epstein's Hot Stove Cool Music benefit concert at Metro (video of Vedder and Epstein playing guitar together can be seen below).\nLast week, Vedder hung out at Stanley's Kitchen and Tap following the Cubs' wins over the St. Louis Cardinals at Wrigley Field.\nKeeping it in the family: Rather than ask famous actors or musicians to throw out the first pitch and sing the seventh inning stretch during the Cubs' playoff games at Wrigley Field, the organization has so far turned to former players for the first pitch and played video of deceased Cubs' legends singing the 7th inning stretch.\n“The postseason provides an opportunity for us to highlight and honor our legends on the largest stage,\" said Cubs senior director of marketing Alison Miller Saturday, via email. \"That includes our living former players like Ryne Sandberg and Kerry Wood, as well as those we’ve lost like Ernie Banks, who the team has honored all season with #14 patches and an emblem painted on the field. We’ll continue to showcase some of our legendary players and perhaps even some legendary celebrity fans as the postseason continues.”\nEddie Vedder performs at Hot Stove Cool Music Eddie Vedder performs with Cubs president Theo Epstein at the Hot Stove Cool Music benefit concert at Metro July 9, 2015.\nEddie Vedder performs with Cubs president Theo Epstein at the Hot Stove Cool Music benefit concert at Metro July 9, 2015.\nSee more videos On the record: \"Usually when I go to the game, I wear the jersey the Cubs made for me with my last name, Nicholas, on it, but I called the team and I said, 'Can you make a Rowengartner jersey for me?\" - \"Rookie of the Year\" star Thomas Ian Nicholas, who told espn.com he plans on attending Wednesday's Cubs-Mets game\nSightings: The Cubs' Anthony Rizzo had dinner with Cubs DJ Dante Monday at Volare. ...
