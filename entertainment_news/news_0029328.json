She has written about a wide range of topics and religions, but it is only of late that she started receiving threats from fundamentalist groups for writing for Muslim websites and, recently, participating in a protest in favour of beef eating. Things got so bad that she lodged a police complaint. BT spoke to the columnist, script writer and associate director who tells us that she doesn't feel safe as a woman writer in the city. Excerpts...\nWhen did the threats originate? I've been receiving threats on social media for 5-6 months for being a liberal writer and a feminist. They've been demanding that I stop writing for Muslim websites. I recently took part in a protest in favour of beef eating, after which things got worse.\nWhat have they been threatening you with? There are threats on my life. They even said that they will attack me with acid and rape me â€” they have used such words in their online posts. I think they work like an organization because they used several fake accounts. Madhusudhan Gowda is the only person who messaged me from his real account.\nIs society getting regressive? I think people's tolerance has greatly reduced. If anyone writes anything critical, it is assumed to be anti-national and anti-Hindu. So, there has been a dip in tolerance against rationalism, liberal thoughts, writing and women in particular.\nWhat is your association with the Kannada film industry? I am a script writer and have worked for B Suresha in the past. I and am now working for Pooja Gandhi for her upcoming movie Raavani as a script writer and associate director.\nWhat kind of support have you got from the film industry? Pooja left everything that she was doing just to support me. She came with me to the police station to lodge the complaint and stayed me with me for hours together.\nWhat kind of an outcome are you expecting now that the complaint has been lodged? I don't think much will happen because even after filing the complaint, I continue receiving threats on my timeline. So, I have no hopes. But I wanted to document my protest against the people who have been threatening me. I wanted to raise my voice and make it clear that they cannot curb my writing spirit. I will keep writing.\nDo you feel safe as a woman in Bengaluru? No, not at all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:08:26.294+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
