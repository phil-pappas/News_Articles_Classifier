Joining Ruffalo are Brian d’Arcy James (“Admission”), and director/writer Tom McCarthy (“Win Win”) and writer Josh Singer (“The Fifth Estate”) A chronicle of The Boston Globe Spotlight team’s investigation of the Catholic Church sex scandals of the early 2000s, “Spotlight” also stars Rachel McAdams, Michael Keaton, Liev Schreiber, Stanley Tucci, John Slattery and Billy Crudup. Globe journalists also attending the screening are Marty Baron (Schreiber) , Michael Rezendes, (Ruffalo), Walter ‘Robby’ Robinson (Keaton), Sacha Pfeiffer (McAdams), Ben Bradlee Jr. (Slattery), and Matt Carroll (James). “Spotlight” is earning early award-season buzz. It landed best feature and screenplay nominations, and a special jury award for its ensemble cast for the upcoming Gotham Awards, the first major awards show on the circuit. The film opens in Boston Nov. 6. The Coolidge Corner Theater hosted the Boston premiere of Depp’s ‘Whitey’ Bulger biopic on Sept. 15. Police closed streets and traffic was rerouted as thousands of fans lined Brookline Avenue to catch a glimpse of Depp. Dana Barbuto may be reached at dbarbuto@ledger.com or follow her on Twitter @dbarbuto_Ledger.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:40:07.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
