Dawn French and Chris O’Dowd during filming of The Graham Norton Show (Matt Crossick/PA) \nHe said: “We met Brad Pitt and we were having a chat, he was very nice and I introduced him to Dawn and they shook hands and we kept on talking. He then started chatting to some other people and I looked down and saw that she was still holding on to two of his fingers. I suggested we go to our seats and she said, ’41 seconds’. When I asked her what she meant, she said, ‘That’s how long I held him for’. \n“A couple of weeks later we met Bradley Cooper at a dinner and as we were leaving Dawn was getting her phone out of her bag and I noticed something sparkling. She had stolen his fork. She said she was going to auction it for charity but every now and then at home I’d see her eating with it. It’s hard to feel like a sex symbol when your wife uses another man’s cutlery!” Promoted stories \nTalking about his hit TV series, Moone Boy, he said it may return next year again. \n“We took a break because I thought I’d told all the stories I could and we got to the stage when the boys’ voices were breaking,” he said. “We needed a breathing period.” \nHe also joked that he doesn’t get to do “a lot of sex stuff” in his films. Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz (Matt Crossick/PA) \n“Not from want of trying,” he explained. “I’ve tried it a couple of times and they didn’t care for it – the clothes started coming off and the director shouted, ‘Cut, no, we want people to watch the film!’.” \nOther guests on the show included Rachel Weisz, Colin Farrell, Dawn French and singer Rod Stewart. \nRachel, who is currently starring opposite Colin in the movie The Lobster, spoke about having a “Mrs Daniel Craig” car screen visor. \nThe actress is married to Daniel, who is set to reprise his role as James Bond in the upcoming Spectre. Rod Stewart (Matt Crossick/PA) \nTalking about her husband with comedy star Dawn, who joked she was “gutted” when the pair married, she said: “You should get one of those Mrs Daniel Craig car screen visors. I have one. I don’t use it all the time but once and a while I’ll put it up.” \nDawn replied: “I’ve got a great idea. You have the screen visor and I’ll have Daniel.” \nColin spoke about one of his sons, saying: “For father’s day, his school asked the children to describe their fathers and sent it home in a letter. It was gorgeous and ridiculous. He said, ‘My dad is a lot of fun and I like him a lot. He has blond hair and is very handsome’. The bit about the blond hair obviously had me concerned!” Share article \nThe Graham Norton Show is on BBC One on October 16 at 10.35pm.
