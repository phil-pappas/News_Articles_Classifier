She acknowledged Duckworth has a \"compelling story\" to tell but argued she does as well.\n\"Congresswoman Duckworth has high name recognition, it's very significant,\" she said. \"But my track record and experience moves the needle and we think will move the needle enough, if we can get our message out, for me to win.\"\nThe winner of the March primary will face incumbent Republican Sen. Mark Kirk, one of the top national Democratic targets in November 2016.\nZopp, 58, is a Harvard-educated lawyer and former state and federal prosecutor. The Morgan Park resident also been a top lawyer for three major companies — Exelon Corp., Sears Holdings Corp. and the Sara Lee Corp. — and sat for four years on the Chicago Board of Education.\nDuckworth, 47, is an Iraq War amputee who is better-known and more well-financed. The Hoffman Estates congresswoman was endorsed by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in July, a move Zopp on Friday called a \"mistake.\"\nSenate hopeful Zopp: Byrd-Bennett's ties to firm were 'a plus, not a negative' Rick Pearson and Bob Secter Chicago Public Schools CEO Barbara Byrd-Bennett's ties to SUPES Academy were viewed as \"a plus, not a negative\" when the consulting firm landed a $20.5 million no-bid contract now linked to a federal criminal probe, former school board member and current U.S. Senate candidate Andrea Zopp said Monday.\n...

(Rick Pearson and Bob Secter) \"I didn't have a chance to present my credentials and what I could do to them before they made a decision,\" Zopp said.\nZopp would not discuss what she planned to say during her meeting with the DSCC. She talked instead about her strategy, which she said involved getting out the African-American and Hispanic vote and support from associates in law and business.\nThe turnout in recent statewide Democratic primaries in Illinois has been about 62 percent white, 28 percent African-American and 8 percent Hispanic, Zopp said. \"Our path to victory runs directly through Cook County, where I have a deep base,\" she said.\nZopp left the Chicago school board in May. She led the Chicago Urban League for almost five years until June. Her financial disclosure filed Tuesday in the Senate showed she was paid $108,000 by the Urban League in 2015 and about $296,000 in 2014. She also reported $63,000 for board service at Urban Partnership Bank, several investments and no debts of more than $10,000.\nMorning Spin: Byrd-Bennett indictment could reverberate in Democratic U.S. Senate campaign Tribune staff report Welcome to Clout Street: Morning Spin, our new weekday feature to catch you up with what's going on in government and politics from Chicago to Springfield.\nTopspin\nIt's Friday, Oct. 9, the day after Mayor Rahm Emanuel's former Chicago Public Schools CEO Barbara Byrd-Bennett was indicted in a contracting...\nWelcome to Clout Street: Morning Spin, our new weekday feature to catch you up with what's going on in government and politics from Chicago to Springfield.\nTopspin\nIt's Friday, Oct. 9, the day after Mayor Rahm Emanuel's former Chicago Public Schools CEO Barbara Byrd-Bennett was indicted in a contracting...\n(Tribune staff report) Duckworth has major endorsements including a nod from presidential hopeful Hillary Rodham Clinton. Zopp has the backing of former Commerce Secretary Bill Daley and wealthy Chicago influentials including John Rogers Jr., Michael Sacks and Mellody Hobson.\nZopp said her top issues are job creation and economic development; criminal justice reform and violence reduction; and education.\nShe acknowledged she is new to politics. \"But I am not new to the public sector or public service,\" she said, \"and so when you look at the breadth of my experience, I know I can go to Washington and the Senate and make a difference.\"\nZopp was on the school board when it awarded a $20.5 million, no-bid contract to a company tied to then-Chicago Public Schools chief Barbara Byrd-Bennett, who faces prison time after pleading guilty to steering the contract in return for the promise of hefty kickbacks. In late August, before Byrd-Bennett's indictment and plea, Zopp said Byrd-Bennett's ties to the company that won the contract raised no alarms and was viewed as \"a plus, not a negative.\"\n\"In retrospect, obviously Dr. Byrd-Bennett came to the district … with a scheme to defraud,\" Zopp said Friday. \"She had a plan to deceive and she was successful in doing that. So obviously in light of that, that decision was not the right decision.\"\nkskiba@tribpub.com\nTwitter @KatherineSkiba\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune U.S. Senate Barbara Byrd-Bennett Sara Lee Corporation Bill Daley Sears Holdings Corp.", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562ad730/turbine/ct-andrea-zopp-senate-race-20151023", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55e4cae7/turbine/ct-andrea-zopp-tribune-editorial-board-met-0901-20150831", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5616fb54/turbine/ct-andrea-zopp-tammy-duckworth-barbara-byrd-bennett-us-senate-20151008"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:41:18.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
