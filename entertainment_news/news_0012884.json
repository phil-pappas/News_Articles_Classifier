The former Disney darling performed \"Same Old Love\" off the record during her appearance on the late-night talk show. Gomez looked gorgeous in a black low-cut dress teamed with matching coat, a birdcage veil and heels. Clutching a vintage microphone, she sang while sitting atop a piano and on a chair placed in the middle of the stage. \"Same Old Love\" was released as the second single off \"Revival\", which came out last Friday. The album has been projected to open at No. 1 on next week's Billboard 200 with more than 110,000 equivalent albums. On the Wednesday episode of \"Tonight Show\", Gomez also went ghost-hunting with Jimmy Fallon . While chatting with the host, she showed him an app on her phone she's been using to see if there are any spirits at the various venues she visits on her tour. \"I believe in ghosts, so I have a ghost app,\" she told him. \"I believe that spirits can tap into technology. Why not, right?\" The app freaked Fallon out a little bit, but he kept poking fun at it before Gomez told him, \"You know what, you're actually upsetting the spirits, they're mad at you.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:22:35.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
