That's what my break was really about. I could've had a stroke,\" she told Billboard magazine . \nThe \"Good for You\" singer was all over the news in early 2014 with some tabloids claiming she had a drug problem or was pregnant. \nAnd it looks like the rumors got to her. She says, \"I locked myself away until I was confident and comfortable again.\" \nGomez has had to deal with a ton of unfair scrutiny lately. In addition to whispers of rehab, the singer says she's faced criticism about her weight. (Video via Interscope Records and Polydor ) \n\n\"You know the past year was so, um. I've never been body-shamed before,\" Selena Gomez said on \"On Air With Ryan Secrest.\" \n\"But you know what's interesting is I posted this photo to Instagram and was like, 'There's more to love.' I'm happy with myself. And the reason why I did that is I didn't want them to win.\" (Video via On Air With Ryan Seacrest ) \nAnd she's proving she's all good with showing off her body positivity with her new album cover. \nThis video includes images from Getty Images.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T05:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:06:50.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
