But, what about music? If you want to take your Halloween playlist beyond \"Monster Mash\" or Michael Jackson's \"Thriller,\" here are some creepy songs that truly terrify. \"These Things\" by She Wants Revenge Originally released: 2006 Why is it creepy? This dark tune came from the equally dark She Wants Revenge. The song deals with loneliness, but the way the singer delivers these monotone vocals that makes it feel like it could be about him trying to abduct and murder someone.Both this song and \"Tear You Apart\" make She Wants Revenge a truly terrifying band. The robotic-sounding singer and his delivery makes everything sound like what the horror movie villain would whisper in your ear before you met your doom. \"The Hills\" by The Weeknd Originally released: 2015 Why is it creepy? Abel Tesfaye, better known as The Weeknd, has managed to create a song about sex, one of his major song topics, and turn it into something disturbing.One, it is speaking to a paramour, who is obviously in a different relationship. And there are the screams spliced into the music during various points in the song.There is an aura of destruction and horror in the way this song is delivered. This isn't a relationship of love, it's a mutually-ensured destruction.At the close of the song, a woman sings \"What about love?\" - and that's a good question. What about love? There is no love here - just pure, unadulterated lust. \"Sweet Dreams\" by Marilyn Manson Originally released: 1995 Why is it creepy? The original by the Eurhythmics has a creep factor, mainly for the cold electronic beats and Annie Lennox's flawless delivery. But Manson takes it and turns the creep factor up to 11.Manson has always been famous - or infamous - for his frightening and violent imagery. His vocal delivery of this song makes this probably one of the scariest covers ever.His minacious vocals makes you feel like you should constantly be looking over your shoulder, because the Boo-geyman is probably coming for you - and he looks like Marilyn Manson in the video.He demands your attention by quietly singing most of the verses and delivering the chorus with a powerful yell. You can't tear yourself away. \"Ride The Wings Of Pestilence\" by From First To Last Originally released: 2004 Why is it creepy? Long before he became Skrillex, Sonny Moore was a 16-year-old singing in the band From First to Last.What makes this particular song disturbing is the graphic description of murder and dismemberment.The song deals with the narrator kidnapping and murdering someone - likely a young woman, but that's my interpretation.\"I've been dreaming about you in a pool of your own blood, with your eyes gouged out by the work of my thumbs,\" Moore sings.From First to Last was never going to be regarded as a great, or good, band, but they were darker than some bands, which made them \"cool.\" \"Ultraviolence\" by Lana Del Rey Originally released: 2014 Why is it creepy? Lana Del Rey managed to create a haunting track about domestic violence.This song describes a bad relationship, a major theme in Del Rey's music, and she has garnered quite a bit of controversy for the line \"He hit me and it felt like a kiss.\"Del Rey doesn't glamorize abuse. Like Bob Dylan, she delivers her lyrics with a sense of irony - which can make her intentions difficult to interpret. For me, I think most things she sings can be taken with a grain of salt. She sings about many aspects of femininity, but I feel underneath, Del Rey is dark.Her sweet-sounding vocals mixed with the heavy issues make this a song you would want to play while walking through a graveyard. \"We Sleep Forever\" by Aiden Originally released: 2006 Why is it creepy? Many songs on this list deal with obsession and stalking, but this song is overtly about self-mutilation and suicide.Death is creepy. Making a song about causing your own death is even more terrifying. The band does romanticize this notion in the song, which ups the scariness.Singer Will Francis has a very soothing voice, almost likening him to the Angel of Death. He's almost encouraging the female subject of the song to kill herself, so they can \"sleep forever.\" This disturbed lullaby will give you chills. \"Disturbia\" by The Cab Originally released: 2009 Why is it creepy? The Cab has managed to take a catchy pop song that deals with paranoia and anxiety and make it more menacing. Singer Alex DeLeon does a great homage to Rihanna but manages to make the song even better.Probably the least \"scary\" of all of the songs on this list, The Cab released this song as part of the \"Punk Goes Pop\" series, and it's one of the standout covers, using real instruments rather than produced beats, as well as hearing DeLeon use his voice to convey a real sense of paranoia and fear. The use of autotune also helps the song - making it sound colder and more menacing. \"Stan\" by Eminem Originally released: 2000 Why is it creepy? Eminem plays two characters in the song: the obsessed titular fan as well as himself.Listening to Stan slip farther and farther into his obsession with the rapper, presented in the form of him writing letters to his hero, is absolutely frightening.You can hear something wrong with Stan in the first verse but as the second and third begin, you realize no one in this song is going to be okay. Stan grows angrier with Eminem, who still hasn't responded to his fan's letters.Eminem does end up responding to Stan's letters, but it's all in vain. This song, along with \"Kim\" and \"'97 Bonnie and Clyde\" are some of Eminem's most disturbing works. If you want to kick off your Halloween with terror, this is the way to go. \"She\" by Tyler The Creator Ft. Frank Ocean Originally released: 2011 Why is it creepy? A rap song about stalking with a chorus from one of the best artists around? Sign me up.\"She\" is an interesting song - but it's terrifying nonetheless. The song deals with the narrator becoming obsessed with the new neighbor and all of the things he would like to do to her.Stalking, obsession and necrophilia are all heavy themes in this song, mixed with Tyler the Creator's aggressive rapping and Frank Ocean's calmer, more calculating singing. \"This Is Halloween\" by Panic! At The Disco Originally released: 2006 Why is it creepy? What would a Halloween song playlist be without a song from \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\"?Of the two cover versions of this song, I feel Panic's version is leagues better than Marilyn Manson's. Although Manson is an obvious choice to deliver a Halloween-themed song, Panic singer Brendon Urie has a more impressive vocal range - and is just a better singer than Manson.Urie's vaguely threatening vocals work best to deliver the opening track from the classic film. Although Urie doesn't manage to do the different voices for the various characters in the track, he does manage to deliver something that is a great follow-up to a Danny Elfman masterpiece.This song will definitely get anyone ready for Halloween. If you're inspired to watch \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\" after listening, I take full responsibility for it.
