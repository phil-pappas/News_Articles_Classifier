Instead, I start off by thrashing five people. I loved it.\" Nikki's character is named Archana while Vishnu Vishal plays the hero of the untitled movie.\n\"There are also scenes where I beat up the hero as well as the renowned comedian Soori's character,\" she says. And do they mind? \"Well, I guess Vishnu finds my look in the police uniform quite hilarious, as he starts laughing every time I appear in the attire! But he has no choice other than to get thrashed,\" she says. The actress, who has about a month more of the shoot left, has also completed Kunchacko Boban-starrer Rajamma@Yahoo and the Telugu film Krishnashtami.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T14:30:07.673+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
