Having run the gamut of TV panel shows, after a while you know how to do them and they are not as much fun any more. But now I know I’m going to be on stage and that prospect is really exciting. \n“For those two hours, no one is looking at their phones. It’s a true non-media event. Those sorts of occasions are rapidly disappearing, and that’s why I value them so much. \n“People don’t even listen to president Obama speaking without looking at their phones all the time. So maybe those two hours when I’m up there on stage provide a respite from all of us slowly turning into gadget-pedalling robots.” \nAlthough the comic, who won two Emmys for his work as a writer on The David Letterman Show, also adds: “If you told me I would have to listen to anyone – apart from Richard Pryor – on stage for two hours, I’d think, ‘Oh God’. So it’s good to break up the show with musical interludes.” \nRich’s grouchy, deadpan style has established him as a master of absurdist irony and the king of rapid-fire wit. \n“I’m not really angry at all. There are very small outward changes in my emotions. I have a sort of deadpan Walter Matthau visage. People think ‘this guy looks grumpy’, but that’s just how my face is put together. Your comic demeanour has to match your face. Most comedians fit their face,” he jokes.
