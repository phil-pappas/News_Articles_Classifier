In a way, it was like this but then they were smaller and flying was another business,\" he said. \n\"But this is a kind of place for a take-off to all kinds of directions and all kinds of situations.\" \n(Reporting by Johnny Cotton in Paris; Writing by Marie-Louise Gumuchian in London; Editing by Alison Williams ) Models present creations by German designer Karl Lagerfeld as part of his Spring/Summer 2016 women's ready-to-wear collection for fashion house Chanel at the Grand Palais which is transformed into a Chanel airport during Fashion Week in Paris, France, October 6, 2015.
