Related Items \nMARLON Williams has been called the \"New Zealand Elvis\". \nAnd there is some truth to that statement. \nTheir similarities are mainly in the masculine fragility Williams exposes when performing, in the same way Presley did. \nWilliams' music style straddles folk, country, soul, bluegrass and the blues, and as such he was part of the line-up of Bluesfest 2015. \nHe is coming back next month to Byron Bay, this time to the Byron Theatre, with The Yarra Benders. \nWe spoke to Marlon while he was shooting a feature film in Auckland, New Zealand. \nAre you on a break from filming? \nThat's right. I am shooting a New Zealand feature film called The Rehearsal at the moment. \nI heard you are in a ABC series on Australian TV. Is that correct? \nThat's right. It's coming up shortly. It's called The Beautiful Lie (a re-imaging of Leo Tolstoy's novel Anna Karenina). \nActing is all fairly new to me, I just fell into it. \nI'm enjoying it but it was never what I thought I wanted to do. \nIt's a big challenge and I'm pretty excited to take it on. \nSounds like it has been pretty busy for you ... \nIt's been a pretty busy half of the year and I'll be stoked if I can finish it alive. \nAre you getting any time to write new music? \nNo. Not at the moment. I'm just going to wait. I try to push myself to do it on the road but I am going to have to dedicate some time for that, early next year. \nWhat can audiences expect of your upcoming Byron Bay gig? \nThe Bluesfest gig was a 45-minute set. The Byron gig will have all the aspects of that show and extrapolated into a bigger and more detailed show. \nI tend to start acoustically, often solo, and then start bringing out the band as the show progresses. Then we go into a bluegrass three-part harmony. \nThen we go into the full band. \nAt the Byron Community Centre, 69 Jonson St, Byron Bay, on Sunday, November 15, 7.30pm.
