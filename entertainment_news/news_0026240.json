According to TMZ , the rapper said that their public display of emotion over Lamar's condition after he was found unconscious at Pahrump brothel was just an act. \"So many phony and fake people out here now,\" the rapper whose real name is Percy Robert Miller told the website. \"I'm talking about Kobe, all his men with whom he plays basketball. If Kobe was [Lamar's] friend... Kobe, like, owns the team. He could've got the man back on the team ... that's all he wanted.\" When Master P was asked whether or not Kobe and the Kardashians visiting Lamar at the hospital was just for publicity, he said, \"It looks like it.\" He then recounted how serious Lamar was about wanting to return to the NBA. \"If you're my friend, if you cared about me, why didn't you get me to training camp,\" he said. The \"Uncle P\" actor thought that Lamar's involvement on his then-wife Khloe Kardashian 's show \" Keeping Up with the Kardashians \" was the beginning of his downturn. \"[Lamar] thought that this show was going to help him at the basketball,\" Master P said. \"You know, I feel like, 'it's crazy,' because now you know all these people love you, talk all about stuff about you and how they miss you to do the best basketball but when you was around, you have no love.\" After Lamar's rocky marriage with Khloe, he had a hard time coming back to NBA. \"He was in good shape but I think he got blackballed,\" Master P claimed. \"I mean, because of what he was into. They feel like he was on the reality show... I feel like, 'it's fake.' \" However, the rapper revealed that Lamar loved Khloe sincerely. He then warned all NBA players including James Harden to be careful when they deal with the Kardashians. Master P's comment aside, Rob Kardashian followed in her mother Kris Jenner 's footsteps to invite his followers on Instagram to pray for the athlete . Rob took to the social media on Wednesday, October 14 to share a throwback picture of him and Lamar in a manly embrace. He captioned it, \"Praying nonstop for my Brother !!\" Foto kiriman ROBERT KARDASHIAN (@robkardashian) pada Okt 14, 2015 pada 6:35 PDT \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T11:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:46:49.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
