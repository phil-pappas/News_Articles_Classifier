This rebranding and organizational restructure will allow us to streamline our focus into science fiction and fantasy. In other words, we mean to stick to our knitting, the thing that we are best at.” “This is a perfect opportunity to rededicate ourselves to the core of what got us started in publishing in the first place: making a home for books that can’t find a home anywhere else,” continued Hunt.\n“So we’re excited to start again. We're Ursa Major for the star in the Big Dipper constellation that's named for my father, Hugh M. Hyatt. At Ursa Major RA 12h 56m 7s D 58' 21', there's a star there named Papa Bear. It's not official. It's one of those cheesy International Star Registry things. But it's real to us.”\nUrsa Major Books is committed to publishing interstitial fiction that has clear science fiction, fantasy, horror, or weird elements. Work that traditionally falls in the cracks. Like mash ups in music, Ursa Major Books is looking stories that defy expectations and are inspired by the best and most exciting of everything new in the world, regardless of labels.\n“We love music that crosses genres and becomes something unexpected and new, like the Grey Album or the kind of work that Rock Sugar does. We’re hoping to bring that same delightful fusion to fiction,“ Hunt said.\nUrsa Major Books will primarily focus on eBook publishing, but will release more traditional paperback and hardcover editions when appropriate.\n“This is a watershed moment in the history of publishing, with so many excellent science fiction and fantasy websites and publishers, all of them finding new ways to bring new stories to the people who love them. We’re very excited to be a part of it,” Hunt said.\nUrsa Major Books’ very first book, Wolfshadow by Robert Edward Graham & C.S. Fuqua will be released in early 2016.\nBe on the lookout for Ursa Major Books’ soon to be released book Wolfshadow.\nIn the meantime, be sure to visit http://www.ursa-major-books.com .", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy51cnNhLW1ham9yLWJvb2tzLmNvbQ=="], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T11:54:42.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
