Bobby Jindal says mass shootings show the need for \"a spiritual revival in this country.\" \nThe Republican presidential candidate told ABC's \"This Week\" that the U.S. doesn't need new gun control laws that would disarm law-abiding citizens. He said what America really needs is \"a renaissance of decency.\" \nJindal cited what he called the \"moral decay\" and lack of respect for life reflected in violent movies, TV shows, song lyrics and video games. He added that the gunman in last week's Oregon college shootings was one of millions of young men without a father in the home to guide them. \nThe Louisiana governor also called for stronger U.S. military action to defeat Islamic State militants. \nSound: Upcoming", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:35:21.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
