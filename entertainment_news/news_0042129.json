A personal journey, that is as fascinating as it is inspiring, from living in the streets to living it big and performing to jam-packed crowds all over the world. \nAnd Pineda continues to have the time of his life. Win Against Asthma Ambassador Arnel Pineda \n“We just finished 55 shows this year in the US and Canada, so the band is taking a break muna, doing our own thing and preparing for another tour next year,” Pineda told The Standard. \n“I’m committed to two more years with them so that would be around 120 shows, and I’m looking forward to my first decade with them” he added, dispelling rumors that he has left the band. \nPineda is also trying to finish a solo album every time he’s in the country-- that is when he’s not busy appearing on TV as a guest or making up for lost time with his family. \nAlso keeping him busy are his advocacies, one is the Arnel Pineda Foundation, Inc. (APFI) that provides underprivileged children quality education, health services and medical attention, and the other is being the ambassador for the Win Against Asthma campaign of GlaxoSmithKline. Arnel Pineda, Dr. Gio Barangan GSK Medical Director, Francis Del Val GM GSK \nTogether with actress Kim Chiu and Olympic Figure skater Michael Christian Martinez, Pineda is encouraging asthmatics to get proper treatment and not let their condition stop them from fulfilling their dreams.” \n“I only found out that I had asthma around five years ago, which was also the busiest and most challenging years of my career. I found out that my asthma was triggered by allergies, mold, dust, and cigarette smoke. Being a singer its hard to have asthma attacks especially when you are just about to take the stage, so I always bring my medication with me and somehow developed a routine whenever I feel like I am going to have an attack.” \n“My advice for asthmatics is to consult with your doctor and get properly diagnosed to see what triggers your asthma. Don’t be discouraged and don’t let asthma take over your life.” \nSearch for winners against asthma \nPineda met with 10 young asthmatic achievers at the awarding ceremony on Oct. 7 at Makati Shangri-la. \nLaunched in February 2015, the Search For Winners Against Asthma had more than 2,000 entries from young asthmatic achievers aged 30 years and younger who were eager to share their stories.

He also was an awardee of the 2010 Gawad Huwarang Kabataan of the Antolin Oreta Sr. Foundation and Gawad Modelong Kabataan: Galing at Dangal ng Malabon of the Arnold Vicencio Foundation. He is also the youngest recipient of the Orator of the Year Award in Navotas National High School. \n“Instead of letting asthma stop me I stopped asthma from interfering with my life as I pushed myself as a holistic learner-- excelling in academics, student leadership and in various competitions.” \nThe runners up in the youth category are 15-year old student and dancer Christina Chua; taekwondo twins Andre Rafael and Anton Joachim Montero; consistent scholar Kenneth Angelo Bagay and Dave Andre Labaton who is also a medalist in taekwondo.

She had represented the country in national and international events, specifically as an advocate and a National Peer Educator on Adolescent Female Health. GSK Executives with the Winners Against Asthma Adult Category \n“Asthma runs in our family but symptoms of severe asthma began when I was in college, which, unfortunately, was also the time when I was so involved in my schoolwork and scouting. My mother, who is a doctor and is also an asthmatic, helped me through most of my journey by taking care of me and reminding me to ‘ take my medicines. Actually, because of my asthma, I had to temporarily stop med school because bed rest was advised. But it did not stop me from taking a part-time job as a high school Science teacher. Besides being a doctor, teaching was my second dream job, Teesha narrates. \nThe other winners in the adult category are UP student Ianna Engaño an athlete, musician, artist and social activist; Yasmin Versoza a firefighter and member of the Marikina City Fire Truck crew; Christianne de Vera a triathlete; and Yliah Nina Bosch a registered nurse who is working as an Emergency Nurse Responder at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport. \nThe winners received the following prizes: Huawei P7 Smart Phone; P5,000 worth of gift checks from Folded & Hung and P25,000worth of Sodexo gift certificates.
