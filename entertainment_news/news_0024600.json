A statement from the family reads:\n\"Maureen was our loving mother, grandmother, great-grandmother and friend. She passed peacefully surrounded by her loving family as they celebrated her life listening to music from her favorite movie, The Quiet Man.”\n\"Her characters were feisty and fearless, just as she was in real life. She was also proudly Irish and spent her entire lifetime sharing her heritage and the wonderful culture of the Emerald Isle with the world. Later in life, she became the first woman president of a commercially scheduled airline in the United States.\"\n\"As much as Maureen cherished her privacy, she always appreciated the expressions of good will from people around the world and from all walks of life. She especially loved it when children recognised her from her role in Miracle on 34th Street and asked her: ‘Are you the lady who knows Santa Claus?’ She always answered: ‘Yes I am. What would you like me to tell him?'\"\n\"While we mourn the loss of a very wonderful woman, we also celebrate her remarkable life and hope that it serves as an example to young people around the world, especially in Ireland, to work hard to make their dreams come true and to always have the courage to stand up for themselves.\"\nMORE: Studio chief says Assassin's Creed film will be like 'Batman Begins' or 'Blade Runner'\nMORE: Watch: Never-before-seen outtakes for Aladdin with Robin Williams are very bittersweet\nMORE: Rugrats, Hey Arnold!, Ren & Stimpy and more to star in crossover movie", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:28:07.548+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
