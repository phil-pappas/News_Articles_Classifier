If you dozed off during lectures on semiotics in college, fear not: This novel’s style and tone are brisk and jargon-free.\nThe narrator, Gustavo, has decided late in life to become an auctioneer (“to have my teeth fixed”), a job he thrives at in part by skillfully overhyping the values of the objects on offer. Not that he’s immune to being oversold himself: Did the new set of teeth he buys at auction really once belong to Marilyn Monroe?\nThe skeletal plot focuses on Gustavo’s hosting an auction to benefit a church outside Mexico City, his hoard of prized objects and his reunion with his son. But the book, which was just named a finalist for the $50,000 Kirkus Prize, lives in its offbeat digressions, such as an extended discussion of literary eminences’ lives via their teeth.\nBut all this dental chatter isn’t precisely the point. “We have here before us today pieces of great value, since each contains a story replete with small lessons,” Gustavo tells a group of auction attendees, and the whole book is a kind of extended commentary on how possessions acquire value largely through the stories we tell about them.\nA clever philosophical novel that, as the author puts it, has “less to do with lying than surpassing the truth.”\nVisit Kirkus Reviews online at kirkusreviews.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T05:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:54:18.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
