The `Showman of Sandalwood' will not be directing his son Manoranjan's debut film.The onus of launching Manoranjan in to films has fallen on the production house Jayanna Films. Bharat, who has made only one movie so far, Kanti, will be directing Manoranjan in his first film. Shooting for the film starts in December and will be completed in a single schedule.\nProducer Jayanna (of the Jayanna-Bhogendra duo) said, \"A few months ago, I saw Ravichandran saying in an interview that he would not mind if some reputed banner launches his son. He is currently busy in four to five films and it would have delayed Manoranjan's launch. I approached him two months ago. The negotiations were going on.Bharat had approached me about making a film and I took him to Ravichandran.Both Ravichandran and Manoranjan liked the story Bharat narrated to them.And that is how this happened.\"\nSources say that no less than five other directors narrated a story to Ravichandran and his son for the launch film. But it was Bharat who impressed the Showman. Veteran cinematographer Seetharam and V Harikrishna the music composer have been confirmed to be part of the film.\nThe development comes as a surprise as Ravichandran, who has won the Puttanna Kanagal Award for lifetime achievement in direction, had announced more than a year ago that he would direct his son's debut and also named it Ranadheera - Premalokadalli. But the film has not yet taken off as he has been busy directing and acting in other films like Apurva, Manikya, Drishya and Luv U Alia. He has also accepted new acting assignments in films like Lakshmana and Mungaru Male 2 delaying Manoranjan's debut. Ravichandran directed his brother Balaji's debut Aham Premasmi in 2005 which was not successful.\nHE IS HUNGRY\nBharat made his directorial debut with Kanti starring Srimurali in 2003. But he has not made another film since then, though his debut was both a critical and commercial success. It was Srimurali's second film that also launched the acting career of Kishore. Jayanna said, \"He has that hunger in him because of this. I am more than sure that he will make the best of this opportunity. I found him to be a very good and humble person. I have full faith in him as does Ravichandran sir.\"\n`IT CAN ONLY BE A ROMATIC FILM'\nSpeaking to Mirror, director Bharat said, \"We have not fixed the title of the film yet. And of course it will be a love story. Manoranjan is after all Ravi sir's son. It can all Ravi sir's son. It can only be a romantic film.Since we have not decided on the leading lady yet, the schedules are not yet clearly planned. It will depend on the working style of the lead actors.We will start the film in December.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:05:24.974+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
