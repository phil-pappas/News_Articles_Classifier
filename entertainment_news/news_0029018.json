Studying at universities and colleges in the United States has been a draw for international students and Sun has taken it one step further, providing an opportunity for Chinese students to study abroad at the high school level.\nFor an annual fee of $40,000, his program places Chinese students at a faith-based high school in the Chicago area.\nDerek Zhang, 19, and Christine Li, 15, currently attend Guerin Prep through the Greater Chicago International Academy. Zhang is a junior and Li is a sophomore at the school. They're two of 20 students attending high schools in the Chicagoland area.\nBoth say they've enjoyed their experience so far.\n\"There's more free time to do the things that we love to do,\" Li said. \"I'm on the cross country team and I also play piano.\"\nZhang is on the tennis team and enjoys playing golf. He said he sometimes misses home and his parents â€” but not enough to go back.\n\"I'll graduate in 2016 and I will choose a college in Chicago, and stay here in Chicago and major in international business and hotel management,\" Zhang said.\nSun said the students are happy to be here.\n\"The kids aren't homesick at all,\" he said. \"It's the parents who miss the kids.\"\nSun said students who attend school in the area stay at the Write Inn Hotel in Oak Park and are driven to and from school. They are supervised at the hotel by Greater Chicago International Academy staff, who also provide tutoring and extracurricular activities outside of school.\nThe immersion in the American culture improves their English language skills and helps them with the standardized tests they will take in the future.\nSun said while students are under the academy's supervision, staff and personnel act as their family and home away from home.\n\"We treat them like adults, talk to them like adults, hold them accountable and give them respect,\" Sun said. \"Treat them well and they will treat you well.\"\ndpollard@pioneerlocal.com\nTwitter: @DavidDPollard\n High Schools", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56255a6b/turbine/ct-elm-china-student-boarding-tl-1022-20151019"], "published": "2015-10-20T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:27:47.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
