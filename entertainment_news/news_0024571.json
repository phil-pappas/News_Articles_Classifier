The parade will start by the Inn at Harvard and end at the steps of the magazine’s headquarters, Lampoon Castle. \nIt’s just the seventh time the undergraduate organization says it has bestowed the honour. Previous recipients include Jay Leno, John Cleese and Robin Williams. \nThe 41-year-old Fallon took over The Tonight Show from Leno last year.
