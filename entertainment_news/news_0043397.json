To find the location, you must first solve a puzzle.

There are no prizes. You can play on a team, use a smartphone and it's not really competitive. \nTo find out where the monthly event will be held, you must first solve a puzzle on the game's website, PuzzledPint.com . But there are plenty of hints to keep you from being left out. Specialized knowledge isn't required. \n\"They are often direction-less, and may incorporate traditional puzzles like crosswords, word searches, cryptograms, jigsaw puzzles, word play and logic problems. If you like any sort of logic or word puzzle, you’ll like these,\" according to the Puzzled Pint website. \nRaymond Eifler, 50, of Farmington and Steve Gross, 48, of Northville decided to start Puzzled Pint here and show people the \"joy of puzzling,\" Eifler says, through an easier, sociable alternative to more-competitive puzzle games. People who like board games and trivia nights might enjoy it. \n\"Trivia is like, 'Can you remember this?' but puzzle is, 'Hey, can you figure out this tricky, cool thing?' \" Eifler said. \nPuzzled Pint started in Portland, Ore., in 2010, and is now played in Chicago, San Francisco, London (England), Brooklyn (New York), Boston, Seattle, Vienna (Austria) and Auckland (New Zealand), among a growing number of cities. The same puzzles are worked in all the cities the second Tuesday of every month, and the puzzle to find the location is released on the Puzzled Pint website the preceding Friday.

The first one is Oct. 13 in Livonia (the city being the only hint they shared). \n\"We'll only hold it at pubs that have craft beer, because that's near and dear to our heart, the Michigan craft beer movement,\" Eifler said. \nPeople of all ages above 21 are welcome. Gross said there's a four-hour time limit to solve the puzzles, but the average solving time is about 1½ hours. \nMatt Cleinman, one of the Puzzled Pint's cofounders, said in an e-mail that the puzzles could be compared to the types used in games MIT Mystery Hunt, DASH and the Game.
