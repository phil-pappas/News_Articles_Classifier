My daughter has been in the news. It's been in the news, but it's not news to the family. It's been a decade long,\" Rosie said during the gig. \"As Mom, my wish is for love and peace and wait until it's done.\"\nWatch: Rosie O'Donnell calls daughter Chelsea's interview \"heartbreaking on every level\" \"Chelsea just turned 18. For adopted children 18 is a magic number,\" she added. \"At 18 they're gonna rebel any way they can, any way they can get your attention.\"\nPlay Video CBSN Rosie O'Donnell's daughter found safe Comedian and talk show host Rosie O'Donnell says her 17-year-old daughter Chelsea has been found safe and is in police custody. CBSN's Contessa B...\nStill, Rosie defended Chelsea, who she said had a \"chemical imbalance.\"\n\"I know about mental illness -- I have my own,\" Rosie said, sharing that it started when she was 20, and that she's currently on antidepressents.\n'\"I thought mental illness was failure of my character, not my chemistry.\"\nThe former View co-host is coping with Chelsea's decision to no longer live with her as best as she can. \"What choice do you have but to get through? I have four other kids,\" she explained.\n\"I keep thinking I see Chelsea,\" she later responded to an audience member. \"When your kid isn't there you see them everywhere.\"\nIn an interview with the Daily Mail earlier this month, Chelsea called Rosie \"not genuine,\" which Rosie later called \"heartbreaking on every level.\" Currently, Chelsea is living with Steve Sheerer -- the 26-year-old man she met on Tinder and was found with on Aug. 18 after leaving Rosie's home -- and his family in Barnegat Township, New Jersey. This comes after Chelsea left Rosie's home once she turned 18 to spend time with her birth mother, Deanna Micoley.\nClearly, Rosie has had a tough year. She's currently facing a new lawsuit from a former senior \"View\"producer, who claims she created a \"threatening environment.\" And in addition to the very public fallout with Chelsea, she's in an intense custody battle with her ex-wife , Michelle Rounds, over their daughter, Dakota, and is still dealing with the death of her father, Edward Joseph O'Donnell, in August, whom she had a strained relationship with . She also addressed her longtime feud with Donald Trump on Saturday night.\n\"I spent every day this week in therapy in the midst of the bulls**t. What has happened with my life?\" Rosie said. \"Five months ago I was a married woman and Donald Trump was a reality star. Now my world has blown up. He is the Republican frontrunner, and the zombie apocalypse is upon us.\"\n\"After the divorce, my ex wife spoke to every media outlet,\" she added. \"Can anybody say, 'Prenup?'\"\nIn April, ET talked to Rounds when she filed for sole custody of 2-year-old Dakota. According to her attorney at the time, the move was \"necessary to protect the child's general welfare.\" Rounds claimed that Dakota would live in a \"healthier\" and \"way more protective\" environment if she had sole custody.\n\"I will walk away from the prenup if Rosie will give me full custody,\" Rounds said.\nWatch below.", "external_links": ["http://www.etonline.com/news/163659_rosie_o_donnell_ex_michelle_rounds_talks_wanting_sole_custody/", "http://www.etonline.com/news/171333_rosie_o_donnell_daughter_chelsea_asks_judge_to_be_reunited_with_man_she_was_found_with/", "http://www.etonline.com/news/169511_rosie_o_donnell_responds_to_donald_trump_diss_during_republican_debate/", "http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid1250536613001/?bctid=4204775916001", "http://www.etonline.com/news/174206_former_producer_of_the_view_sues_rosie_o_donnell_for_creating_a_threatening_environment/", "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/08/19/2bc06b84-931f-47af-91e6-e862741360dd/thumbnail/220x140/35d1bbe572ad070dab1b1c38f6f2e4d4/chelseaodonnell434815640x360.jpg", "http://www.etonline.com/news/173436_rosie_o_donnell_calls_daughter_chelsea_interview_heartbreaking_on_every_level/", "http://www.etonline.com/news/170510_rosie_o_donnell_father_edward_joseph_o_donnell_dies_at_81/"], "published": "2015-10-20T02:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:48:47.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
