After his MMG labelmate made some comments about his ongoing beef with the Canadian native, the Philly rapper blasted him in an Instagram post he sent out on Wednesday, October 21. Earlier in the day, Wale stopped by \"The Breakfast Club\" and voiced his opinion on Meek and Drake's infamous feud, which started after the former accused the latter of using a ghostwriter. Despite being on the same label, he's obviously not taking Meek's side and even called him out for bringing \"a pencil to a gun fight.\" \"He ain't even bring a knife - a pencil. A piece of paper. He tried to paper cut him to death. You can't compete with somebody that got them type of relationships,\" he continued. \"I'm tellin' everybody who thinks that Meek lost this off the strength of losing. It doesn't matter what he made. He could've wrote 'Ether 3.0' and the opinions of the people would've been that their boy from Canada waxed him.\" After learning of the interview, Meek posted a lengthy message to Wale on Instagram. \"N***as b doing all this to drop a new record gossiping about they h** a** feelings and they personal life because they miserable and nobody don't rock wit them!\" he said. \"Really stay away from me Fam! U not MMG NOMORE! This why u can't get my number you a h**!\" \"I wasn't even mad at you Fam u got some real issues with yaself and you jealous! Broke rapper!\" he added and then told Wale to \"go jump off a roof like u been tryna do chump.\" A photo posted by Meek Mill (@meekmill) on Oct 21, 2015 at 2:57pm PDT It didn't take Wale too long to respond to Meek's backlash. Later on Wednesday, he jokingly wrote on Twitter that he's \"currently lookin for a roof.\" Currently Lookin for a roof °��¯��¿��½��¯��¿��½��¯��¿��½ — Young Olu the Genius (@Wale) October 21, 2015 \n© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T05:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:50:59.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
