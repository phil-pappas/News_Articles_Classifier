The charges were filed Wednesday. Authorities said witnesses identified Cassidy as the driver in a photo lineup.\nCassidy's lawyer, Jason Forman, says the police report is riddled with inconsistencies. He says Cassidy gave police his driver's license and registration before leaving the scene. A hearing has been scheduled for Oct. 27.\nCassidy, who starred in \"The Partridge Family\" television show, lives in Fort Lauderdale. He filed for bankruptcy earlier this year.\n___\nInformation from: Sun Sentinel , http://www.sun-sentinel.com\n___\nInformation from: Sun Sentinel , http://www.sun-sentinel.com/\nGet great articles like this sent to your inbox!
