Research and Markets ( http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/6gg2pb/facial ) has announced the addition of the \"Facial Recognition Market - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast 2015 - 2022\" report to their offering. The global facial recognition market was valued at US$ 1,307.0 Bn in 2014 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.5% from 2015 to 2022\nCurrently, the market is primarily driven by robust technological advancements for development of efficient surveillance systems required by civil and government agencies. This is due to rising instances of criminal and terrorist activities and identification of fraud cases across the globe. Moreover, facial recognition systems that can scan images in all environmental conditions are being developed using 3D facial recognition technology.\nThis would help overcome the barriers of 2D facial recognition technology that include light and pose deflections of the object. However, restrictions on users to share their personal details i.e. covert monitoring of an individual, is expected to hinder the market growth. Furthermore, increased adoption of facial recognition in web applications for picture tagging, social interaction, and others is expected to drive the demand for facial recognition in future.\nThe global facial recognition market is analyzed on the basis of parameters such as type of technology, end-use industry and geographic regions. Of the different technology types, the 2D facial recognition technology segment contributed a significant revenue share in the global market in 2014. This is due to the adoption and acceptance of 2D facial recognition technology in surveillance, which is primarily due to its low cost and easy installation using existing cameras.\nThe market for 3D facial recognition technology, that offers better and accurate results, is expected to record steady growth as compared to 2D technology. Furthermore, the facial recognition market is witnessing development of facial analytics systems that help generate descriptive metadata about a given face, apart from simple identification. This has resulted in the use of facial recognition technique as both identification and authentication tools.\nThe facial recognition market is dominated by players such NEC Corporation, Safran Group, Cognitec Systems, Aware Inc., Cross Match Technologies Inc., 3M Cogent Inc., Animetrics, Inc., Ayonix, Inc., FaceFirst Inc. (Airborne Biometrics Group Inc.), ZK Software, and Aurora Computer Services Ltd. Of these, NEC Corporation, Cognitec Systems, and Safran Group (Morpho S.A.) held a significant revenue share in the global facial recognition market.\nFor more information visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/6gg2pb/facial\nMedia Contact:\nLaura Wood , +353-1-481-1716, press@researchandmarkets.net\nSOURCE Research and Markets\nRELATED LINKS\nhttp://www.researchandmarkets.com", "external_links": ["http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/6gg2pb/facial"], "published": "2015-10-22T20:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:17:48.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
