All together \nMany people thought the title was disrespectul to the real First family of America, the Obamas. “We are teasing!” a Cosmo spokesman said in response to the controversy. “Though who knows, if Kanye runs for president then we may be soothsayers. \n“[The Kardashians] are a huge cultural phenomenon,” the spokesman continued. “What we do know is there is nothing like the cover of a magazine to provoke a national conversation.” \nCombined, the Kardashian/Jenner clan have more than 350 million fans online, more than any other family in the world, including the Obamas, who have 75 million. \n“No one could have predicted the Kardashians’ and Jenners’ success,” Ryan Seacrest tells the magazine inside the cover story. “But when you spend time with them, what resonates is the family unit. There are so many things about them that are glamorous, crazy, and unlike our lives, but the sense of family is universal. They love and stand by one another no matter what.” Kardashian Jenner women on the cover of Cosmopolitan US.
