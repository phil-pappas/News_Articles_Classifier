Now the real meal begins . With conference action in full swing, there are five matchups featuring ranked opponents on the schedule this week, including three in the Southeastern Conference.\nHere's a look at what the decisive factors in each of Saturday's biggest contests (all times Eastern):\nJake Coker vs. Greyson Lambert\nTIME/TV: 3:30 p.m. Saturday, CBS\nThe biggest uncertainties for Alabama and Georgia are at the quarterback position. Both Coker or Lambert will be facing talented defenses geared to stop the run. Coker has been up and down for the Tide and now must make his first true road start in a hostile environment. If the Bulldogs slow Derrick Henry, the senior has to be efficient in the passing game and avoid the mistakes that have led to him throwing four interceptions this season. Lambert hasn’t face the competition Coker has, and it’s been easy to function with Nick Chubb and Sony Michel running wild against defenses. That won’t be the case Saturday because Alabama's defensive line is too talented to be run on for four quarters. How Lambert handles the pressure of the big stage is crucial for Georgia to getting a long-anticipated victory to boost the program to the next level.\nUSA TODAY SPORTS WIRE\nUSA TODAY Sports college football staff picks for Week 5\nDeshaun Watson vs. Notre Dame defense TIME/TV: 8 p.m. Saturday, ABC\nThis matchup is critical for both sides as the Clemson quarterback seeks to validate his high expectations, and the Irish defense needs improve on its road performance at Virginia that almost led to a shocking loss. Watson is still less than a year removed from knee reconstruction, and he struggled against Louisville in the toughest game of the Tigers season. His mobility will be a challenge for Notre Dame front line, while his strong arm will test the secondary. The Irish are blessed with more athleticism than previous years, led by linebacker Jaylon Smith. One area of improvement for the unit will be to find a way to create turnovers. Notre Dame only has three through four games, and that number will have to change because they can't be expected to force a bunch of punts against a talented offense playing in front of a boisterous home crowd.\nClemson quarterback Deshaun Watson looks to throw against Louisville. (Photo: Jamie Rhodes, USA TODAY Sports)\nOklahoma defense vs. West Virginia passing game TIME/TV: noon, Saturday, Fox Sports 1\nHow much can a defense improve in two weeks? We will find out when the Sooners try to rebound from a horrific showing against Tulsa when they allowed 427 passing yards. The signs are ominous, however, with the Mountaineers coming into Norman averaging 323 yards in the air through three games. The Oklahoma defensive front probably can't get pressure on its own, forcing defensive coordinator Mike Stoops to blitz West Virginia quarterback Skyler Howard to get him out of rhythm. The drawback is the secondary must be able to hold up in man-to-man coverage, something it struggled to do against the Golden Hurricane. Howard is more than capable of cashing in on the opportunities.\nTulsa wide receiver Keyarris Garrett makes a catch against Oklahoma cornerback Zack Sanchez. (Photo: Alonzo Adams, AP)\nMississippi State secondary vs. Texas A&M wide receivers TIME/TV: 7:30 p.m. Saturday, SEC Network\nOnly six schools have more touchdown passes than the 12 thrown by the Aggies through four games. Christian Kirk and Josh Reynolds have caught seven of those scores and are both averaging more than 18 yards per reception. An inexperienced Bulldogs secondary has held up so far this season and allowed only 170 yards per game against Southern Miss, LSU and Auburn. This a much bigger task because they haven't faced anything like combination of Kirk and Reynolds and a talented quarterback like Kyle Allen, who has taken a huge leap forward as a sophomore. If the Bulldogs are to win, they need to avoid a shootout on the road, and that starts with limiting the Aggies' two biggest weapons.\nKelvin Taylor vs. Mississippi front seven\nTIME/TV: 7 p.m., Saturday, ESPN\nIn two SEC games won by a combined six points, Florida has rushed for a total of 229 yards and averaged 3.5 yards per carry. That isn’t going to cut it against a Rebels defense that is strong and physical up front. The load is going to fall on Taylor, who is the Gators' only real threat at running back. He can’t do it alone, however. The Gators' offensive line must give him some space or there are going to be a lot of third-and-long situations for quarterback Will Grier. That plays right into the hands of Ole Miss' potent pass rush and ball-hawking secondary that has already racked up seven interceptions. A lack of ability to move the chains and control the clock likely force Florida into another amazing fourth-quarter comeback like it had last week against Tennessee.\nPHOTOS: BEST GAMES OF WEEK 5\nArizona at Stanford, Saturday at 10:30 p.m. ET on Pac-12 Network USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Minnesota at Northwestern, Saturday at noon ET on Big Ten Network USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Texas at TCU, Saturday at noon ET on ABC USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Mississippi State at Texas A&M, Saturday at 7:30 p.m. on SEC Network USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Boston College at Duke, Saturday at 3:30 p.m. ET on ESPN3 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Iowa at Wisconsin, Saturday at noon ET on ESPN USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen West Virginia at Oklahoma, Saturday at noon ET on Fox Sports 1 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Texas Tech vs. Baylor in Arlington, Texas, Saturday at 3:30 p.m. ET on ABC/ESPN2 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Notre Dame at Clemson, Saturday at 8 p.m. ET on ABC USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Alabama at Georgia, Saturday at 3:30 p.m. ET on CBS USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Like this topic?
