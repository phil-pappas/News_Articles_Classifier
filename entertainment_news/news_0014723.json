We export pineapples for foreign exchange and we give tax concessions to those companies… they can do the same for musicians. Give them some tax concessions and let them produce good music for the world market.” \n\nFollow me on Twitter: @delaXdela and Instagram: citizendela", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T10:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:03:28.939+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
