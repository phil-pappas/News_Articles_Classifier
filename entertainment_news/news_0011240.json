She tweeted segments from the video to her 5.2 million followers, which was received with great support and disapproval for the teacher's behavior. \nIn her tweets, Ahlam referred to the teacher as a \"criminal,\" while calling on the Emirati government to punish him for the sake of the students, whom she described as the \"country's future soldiers.\" \nOther tweets were more rage-filled, where Ahlam prayed that the teacher who \"broke her heart\" to have his \"hand, leg and head broken for hitting the little boy.\" \nAhlam and Twitter's efforts concluded with the Emirati Ministry of Education in immediately forming a panel to investigate the incident, which resulted in suspending the public school teacher from his job in Ajman. \nEducation Minister Hussain bin Ibrahim Al Hammadi announced the outcome in a tweet sent out on Thursday. \nHe said that the clip is not considered a standard to measure the educational environment in the country's schools . \"It is a single case. we regret it had happened. We reject it and promise it will not reoccur,\" the minister added. هذيل هم جنود الوطن القادمين يجب محاسبه هذا المجرم الظالم ... يضرب الطالب بلا رحمه حسبي الله عليه وكفى #ريتويت pic.twitter.com/w16sO4NxRp — Ahlam - احلام (@Ahlam_Alshamsi) October 14, 2015 Advertisement © 2000 - 2015 Al Bawaba (www.albawaba.com) Rate Article:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T13:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:28:22.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
