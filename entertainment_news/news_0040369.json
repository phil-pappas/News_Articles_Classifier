The National Hispanic Leadership Agenda , which comprises a coalition of 40 Latino organizations in the U.S., has officially asked NBC to cancel Trump's SNL appearance. ​\nIn an open letter to NBC Universal's CEO Stephen Burke, the NHLA wrote that inviting Trump to host was simply enabling \"hate speech for nothing less than a ratings ploy.\" The organization also pointed out that SNL has a less-than-stellar track record when it comes to diversity on the show. Not only has there never been a Latina cast member , but there have only been two Latinos on the show, ever.\nNHLA is flabbergasted that Saturday Night Live (SNL) has invited Donald Trump to host the November 7, 2015 show. Donald Trump has yet to apologize for his bigoted comments about Mexican immigrants. Allowing Trump to host SNL will legitimize and validate his anti-Latino comments. NHLA had praised NBCUniversal, when it severed its ties with Donald Trump. We are appalled that you would enable Trump's hateful speech for nothing less than a ratings ploy and ask that you rescind the SNL invitation.\nHow can SNL justify casting zero Latinas over 41 seasons and only 2 Latinos over the same period, while promoting Trump's divisive speech toward Latinos? U.S. Latinos represent more than half (56%) of net population growth from 2000 to 2010 and are projected to contribute 100 percent of the population growth between the ages of 18-49, key demographics for television networks. On one hand, Comcast is reaching out to Latino viewers on its English language platforms and on Telemundo, its Spanish-language network, while it uses the other hand to face slap us with this unconscionable invitation to Trump. It is unconscionable that a major U.S. corporation-- who needs Latino viewers—is acting so clueless. ​ ​\nThe issue ultimately falls at the foot of Lorne Michaels. Since November 2013, NHLA has requested to meet with Mr. Michaels to discuss the lack of Latino representation on SNL. NHLA has never received a response and are renewing our request here to meet directly with Lorne Michaels to discuss both the guest host invitation to Trump and SNL's historic lack of Latino casting members.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below And the NHLA isn't the only Latino organization that wants Trump off the show. A MoveOn.org petition started by advocacy group America's Voice has more than 121,000 signatures calling for Trump's removal.\n​ Neither Burke nor SNL 's executive producer Lorne Michaels have officially responded to the NHLA's letter, but Trump has, asserting that it was \"smart\" of NBC to tap him as host. \"Frankly, I think the ratings are going to be through the roof,\" Trump said in a phone interview with Fox & Friends .\nWhen asked if he thought there was any chance his appearance could be canceled, Trump replied: \"Lorne Michaels is a very smart guy. NBC are very smart people. If they want to do a show with a third of the ratings, they might do that.\"\nFollow Alanna on Twitter .", "external_links": ["http://nationalhispanicleadership.org/images/advocacy_letters/10-15-15_NHLA_Letter_to_SNL.pdf", "http://pac.petitions.moveon.org/americasvoice/sign/no-room-for-hate-on-saturday?source=c.em&fb_test=0&r_by=12638471", "http://nationalhispanicleadership.org/", "http://www.twitter.com/alannaknunez", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/donald-trump-saturday-night-live-832957?utm_source=twitter"], "published": "2015-10-19T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:08:40.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
