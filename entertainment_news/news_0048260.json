That's Sunday, so set your alarms. \nLast year's festival sold out quicker than ever, with 120,000 tickets going in just 26 minutes. \nThe ticket price for 2016 has gone up to £228 - plus a £5 booking fee. As usual, children aged 12 and under go for free. \nThere will be a resale for any unwanted tickets, or any which haven't been paid for, nearer the festival which is on from 22-26 June. \nThis year's festival was headlined by Kanye West, The Who and Florence and the Machine who stepped in for Foo Fighters after frontman Dave Grohl broke his leg. \nThe line-up is yet to be announced but last month festival organiser Michael Eavis told Newsbeat that they have booked headliners for the next two years. \nHe said four of the acts have headlined before, while two of the acts booked will top the bill for the first time. \nEavis also told us that the festival will not be taking a year off in 2017 as planned. \nInstead, there will be no Glastonbury in 2018. \nFollow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter, BBCNewsbeat on Instagram, Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube and you can now follow BBC_Newsbeat on Snapchat Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T10:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:54:58.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
