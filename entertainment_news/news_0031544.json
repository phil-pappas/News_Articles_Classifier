Nothing special,\" Bachchan told PTI. \nLooking back at the year gone by, the three-time National award-winning actor says he is in a happy space both personally and professionally. \n\"My present, is by the grace of the almighty so immensely busy that I have little time to look back and assess. But even if I were to, what would I assess?\" he said. \n\"Personally I have my family, professionally I have a few projects which I work on, I spend time with them in equal measure. Each passing year is a reward for me.\" \nIn a career spanning more than four decades, Bachchan has delivered power-packed performances in films like \"Deewar\", \"Zanjeer\", \"Sholay\", \"Don\", \"Abhimaan\", \"Agneepath\", \"Black\", \"Sarkar\", \"Cheeni Kum\", \"Paa\", \"Satyagraha\" and \"Piku\" among others. Besides his work in India, Bachchan also made his Hollywood debut in 2013 with Baz Luhrmann's \"The Great Gatsby\". \nThe Indian government honoured him with the Padma Shri in 1984, the Padma Bhushan in 2001 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2015 for his contributions to the arts. \nBachchan will be next seen in \"Wazir\", a drama also starring Aditi Rao Hydari and Farhan Akhtar. The film, directed by Bejoy Nambiar, is scheduled to release in December this year. \nThough the multi-talented actor has done almost everything in his life - from acting, singing, producing films, hosting television shows to being in politics, he is still excited to learn new things. \n\"I wish I could learn music, an instrument, or the art and knowledge of singing. I wish I could spend my time with my father's works to understand them better. I wish I could read some of the great epics of our times,\" Bachchan said. \n\"I wish I could be professionally in the company of those who guide and educate on film and film craft - acting, making, writing, production,\" he said. \nAnother aspect of life that he enjoys most now is spending time with Aaradhya, who is the daughter of Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai. \n\"Every moment spent with her is special.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T18:34:56.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
