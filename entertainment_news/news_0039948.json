Jha | October 12, 2015, 23.20 pm Vikas Bhalla, singer, actor Vikas Bhalla, singer, actor\nI decided to enter Bigg Boss because I wanted to be famous again. My song Hai Dhuan was a hit 19 years ago and my children weren’t born then. Now that they’re grown up, I want them to be proud of their father.\nI am going to do my bit of acting on the show, that’s for sure, but it won’t be all the time. For how long can you play someone else? Yes, I will be myself, but one has to play games at times, that can’t be helped. My only worry is staying away from my kids for so long. I’ve never stayed away from them for a long stretch. To be locked away without them is a torturous thought. But I’ll make them proud. I’ll do nothing to shame my kids.\nArvind Vegda, Gujarati singer\nI’ve already won thousands of hearts with my singing. Winning 15 more hearts inside Bigg Boss should not be difficult for me. Besides, I am from the land of Modiji. I know how to connect with people.\nI am an entertainer and a singer. Of course, I’ll be singing inside the Bigg Boss House. I like to make people happy.\nI was looking at broadening my fan base and got that chance when Bigg Boss was offered to me.\nI know Bigg Boss is all about somehow getting the TRPs. But I won’t stretch myself to behave like someone else.\nPrince Narula, Splitsvilla winner\nI won’t pretend. I am in Bigg Boss to win. In fact that has been my aim for whichever show I do. It’s everything or nothing at all. I am a big Salman Khan fan and a huge Bigg Boss fan. To get both on one show is a dream come true. I didn’t have to think twice about accepting the offer.\nI know some people in the house will fake it and do drama to get TRPs. I can’t do that. I’ll be myself throughout the show. Of course I am going in to win. Who isn’t? But I am not going to get gimmicky for the TRPs. Straight, simple and honest — that’s the path I’ve chosen to take on Bigg Boss.
