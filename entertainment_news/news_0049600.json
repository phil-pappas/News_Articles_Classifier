His parents also died in the brutal months that followed independence.\nA survivor from the village, 84-year-old Bier Hador Singh, recounted the harrowing details for the presenter: \"My father was head of the village ... we began to feel the heat of the houses catching fire.\nPromoted stories \"We were all gathered together and my father had a large sword. The Muslims were demanding a girl. They said 'give us a young and beautiful girl and we will let you alone, let you get on with your lives'.\n\"Our father rejected their demand and said 'No, we won't give you our girls to save ourselves. Rather than let our girls succumb to this shame, we will kill them ourselves and hope they forgive us'.\"\nRani, who described herself as \"not a traditional Indian girl\", was reduced to tears as she heard how wives and daughters were beheaded by their husbands and fathers, while other women threw themselves down wells to escape \"shame\".\nShe said: \"So your father took the decision that him and a couple of other men of the village would murder their own wives and daughters?\n\"It's so cruel. The rest of the women who were left, they made the decision that they would jump in the village well.\n\"It's the most shocking, horrifying account of what humans are capable of.\n\"I feel really angry. I hate that the world was in such a way that that was the only choice that women had. That men would decide their fate.\"\nAfter speaking to Indian author Ritu Menon, who has documented women's experiences during partition, and learning how hundreds of thousands of Muslim, Sikh and Hindu women would have suffered a similar fate, Rani said her \"blood was boiling\".\n\"It makes me think if you were a cow at this time you had more chance of survival,\" she said.\nShare article \"I don't know what I'm going to do but it's changed me.\n\"This moment has changed who I am.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-02T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:27:04.833+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
