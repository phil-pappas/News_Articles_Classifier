Small size, ease of use and high performance are some of the factors because of which memory cards are being preferred over other flash storage technologies. Imaging application for SD memory cards is a relatively mature market as numerous devices are already in usage. Whereas, mobile phones application for SD memory cards holds immense potential for growth during the coming years owing to increasing storage demand over phones from consumers. Development of writing speed and storage capacity of NAND devices is being carried out. The production cost of NAND memory chips is failing steeply with increasing integration of memory chips on single silicon wafer chip.\n\nPMR study offers a 7-year forecast for the global SD memory card market between 2015 and 2022. The market is expected to register a CAGR of 1.5% during the projected period. The study demonstrates the market dynamics and trends in the entire five regions which influence the current nature and future status of SD memory card over the forecast period.\n\nThe global SD memory card market is anticipated to grow at a single-digit CAGR during the forecast period. Growth of the global SD memory card market is mainly driven by advancements in imaging technology, seasonal sales of mobile devices and availability of rich multimedia content. Other trends driving the growth of the SD memory card market include increasing transfer and write speeds, the transition to 3D NAND technology, the inclusion of wireless technologies and increasing storage capacity.\n\nThe global SD memory card market can be segmented, based on card type, into SD card, Micro SD card and Mini SD card. The micro SD card segment dominated the global SD memory card market share with over 90.0% in 2014 and is anticipated to remain dominant during the forecast period.\n\nIn the Application segment, the mobile phone segment dominated the SD memory card market with 68.5% in 2014 and is estimated to remain dominant, with 71.6% of the total global SD memory card market share by 2022. Revenue contribution of tablets segment was 5.2% in 2014 and is projected to grow to 11.6% by 2022, witnessing an increase of 636 Basis Point Share and registering a double-digit CAGR of 10.9%.\n\nStorage capacity segment, In terms of CAGR, 512GB & Above segment is estimated to be the fastest growing segment during the forecast period followed by 256GB segment. Revenue contribution of the 32GB segment was 15.5% in 2014 and is anticipated to grow to 22.0% by 2022, witnessing an increase of 648 Basis Point Share and registering a CAGR of 5.4%.\n\nAmong Region, Asia Pacific dominated the SD memory card market with over 35% market share in 2014 and is anticipated to remain dominant by 2022. Europe and North America collectively accounted for over 35% of the total SD memory card market share in 2014. Among all the regions, MEA is anticipated to register the highest CAGR between 2015 and 2022, followed by Latin America due to the high availability of rich multimedia content and seasonal sales of mobile devices within this region.\n\nSome of the key players identified in global SD memory card market are SanDisk Corporation, Transcend Information Inc., ADATA Technologies Co.
