Users can look for any matches nearby anonymously by just simply swiping the screen left or right. With Tinder, they can locate anyone who is interested in making a connection, which can possibly lead to romance. \nTinder also claims that the new \"Super Like\" feature will take romance to the next level since it increases the user's chance of finding a good match. \nNow that the new feature has been released, users have the option to swipe up, to let the other user know their higher level of interest in them. The \"Super Like\" feature is also limited, which will make users more selective on who they would like to use them. The result guarantees stronger mutual attraction between Tinder users. Facebook/Tinder 'Super Like' results as recorded by Tinder \n\"Every time we bring two people together who otherwise wouldn't have met, we're enabling endless possibilities: a great date, maybe a few good months together, maybe a lifetime, and sometimes just a wasted half hour at a bar,\" said Sean Rad, Tinder CEO, in an official statement on their blog . Rad also said that they wanted Tinder to be more human, and more exciting, which is why they developed the new \"Super Like\" feature. \nTinder app is considered to be one of the most popular online dating smartphone apps over the past three years. According to CNET , the app claims to make around 28 million matches every day, which equals to over 8 billion for the past three years that it has been around. \nThe \"Super Like\" feature was initially launched in Australia last September, and is now showing great results. The report said that the new feature has increased conversation lengths by 70 percent, and a substantial amount of subscription number has risen, especially among Australian women.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:16:22.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
