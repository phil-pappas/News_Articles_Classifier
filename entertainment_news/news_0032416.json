Chris Tarrant (Lauren Hurley/PA) \n“I feel as fit as a fiddle; I’m one of the lucky ones as my voice, body and legs are all working 100 per cent,” he said. \n“I think I just got into the best hospital possible in the shortest time (apart from the hours spent on a plane). I was so well looked after and I am hugely grateful.” \nThe 68-year-old said his health issues has made him re-evaluate his priorities. Chris Tarrant (Jon Furniss/Invision) \n“I’m not working as hard as I used to, but I have a real sense of ‘seize the day’,” he said. \n“I’ve charged around like a lunatic my whole life, and suddenly I’ve realised if I want to enjoy my time a bit more I need to calm down and take a step back.” \nChris, back on our screens presenting Extreme Railway Journeys, recalled one particularly hair-raising journey on the new series. Chris Tarrant presents Extreme Railways (Channel 5) \nHe said: “The scariest moment came when we were up in a helicopter over the Canadian Rockies. I’m not very good with helicopters and there I am with a handful of dynamite sticks to light and throw out of the window! \n“They basically blow up certain spots of snow to prevent avalanches from wiping out trains and killing people. When we took off it was a clear morning, but out of nowhere a huge snow storm erupted and we’re flying over jagged mountain peaks with no radar. The engine then starts making a siren noise, which means we’re going down too fast!” \nChris added: “After what felt like an hour (but was actually about two minutes), the snow cleared and we landed to a crowd giving us high fives. I don’t know why we did it – it was almost like a silly boy’s adventure.” Share article \nChris Tarrant: Extreme Railway Journeys is on Thursdays, Channel 5.
