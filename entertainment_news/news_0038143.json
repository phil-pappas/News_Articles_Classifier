Narcissistic bores who stare at themselves in the mirror for hours are the dullest people on earth.\"\nHurley came to fame as a model, and is best known for her work with Est√©e Lauder. She launched her beach line in 2005, and discussed her approach to aging for Healthy Living magazine's October 2014 issue.\n\"There's zero point in dreading anything inevitable and I never have,\" she asserted. \"Much better to concentrate on what you can change. The kinder and nicer you are to yourself and those around you will make you glow from within -- no matter what birthday you hit.\"\n\"Everyone ages and the same physical things happen to everyone regardless of your bank balance,\" she added. \"However, everyone has the option of staying in shape, staying healthy, staying positive and looking after their teeth, skin and hair.\"\n1 of 2 Elizabeth Hurley impressed fans with this bikini photo Sunday on Instagram.
