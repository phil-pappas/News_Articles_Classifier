Mark Wright (Jim Marks/BBC) \n“So you’ve almost got a full complement of people who have won the show over the past 11 years that could make another series and you’d have all of these people from all walks of life and skill sets. \n“We joke amongst us – obviously I tell them that I would win easily. It would be interesting to see that, I think.” Lord Sugar (Ian West/PA) \nMark, who launched internet marketing company Climb Online with Lord Sugar as a business partner, said: “I would love to go back in some capacity, whether that’s as an assistant to Lord Sugar or as an interviewer like Ricky [Martin] or to use my business on a task, to come in and do something creative.” \nSome might be less keen to return than others. Series six winner Stella English even sued Lord Sugar for wrongful dismissal, but lost the case. Share article \nThe Apprentice begins on October 14 at 9pm on BBC One.
