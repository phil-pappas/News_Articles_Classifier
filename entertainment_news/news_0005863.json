Participating artists will install their own art works as space allows — first come, first served. There is no entry fee and artists do not need to be members to participate. All media are eligible including fine crafts, original hand-pulled prints, photography, electronic art, installation and sculpture. All work must be original; no giclées or reproductions will be accepted. Work created within the last five years is preferred. \nAny artworks that fit the Halloween theme are welcome; however, the Harlow Gallery reserves the right to deny any works deemed too violent, overly sexual or offensive for the public eye. Art for sale is subject to our regular commission rate: the Harlow takes 35 percent for art sold on behalf of members, 50 percent for non-members. Art may be shown as NFS (not for sale). \nArtists should be residents of Maine at least part of the year or otherwise have a strong connection to the state. Artists submitting from out of state are responsible for the costs of shipping work to and from the Harlow Gallery should their work be selected for inclusion in the exhibition (return shipping will be actual cost plus $20 to cover staff time). \nArtwork will be accepted Wednesday and Thursday, Oct. 28 and 29, from noon to 6 p.m./until the gallery is full.
