The Uddhav Thackeray-led party also sent a strong message to the BJP saying its successful Dussehra rally indicated that the future belonged to the Sena and that it was prepared to fight the upcoming (poll) battles alone if needed. (Also Read: Declare India a Hindu Rashtra, says Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray at Dussera Rally) “The BJP has received Modi oxygen in the form of power. This oxygen will last till the subsidy of the popularity ends…Sena is standing firm on its thoughts, struggle and patriotism. The party has never changed its stand on the issues of Hindutva, patriotism, Maharashtra’s identity and issues concerning common man’s life. Our beliefs will not change at any cost,” the Sena said in its mouthpiece ‘Saamana’. Shiv Sena has waged a war against the enemies of the country. The party does not face challenge by anybody, it said adding, peoples’ support will ensure that the Sena’s flag flutters over Maharashtra in the future. ”The future belongs only to the Sena and the Dussehra rally of the party has sent this message across to everybody. We will fight it out with whosoever is willing to join us, or else, we are fully prepared to fight it out all alone with the confidence instilled in us by the Sena chief. Nobody should dare block our path!” it said. The saffron party also hit out at NCP supremo Sharad Pawar apparently over hosting Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in his hometowm Baramati last week. ”With no work left in Delhi, Pawar has opened a new business of lodging and boarding and finding solace in hosting political leaders at Govind Baug in Baramati. With ageing, Pawar’s politics is also on the wane,” it said. “Pawar’s politics is something that should not be taken seriously. You never know when he becomes secular and when he starts praising BJP,” the Sena said. Taking a dig at Congress, it said the Sonia Gandhi-led party has become virtually a non-entity in Maharashtra. “There are no (Congress) leaders, workers and hence no voters.” \n  12:40 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T12:03:30.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
