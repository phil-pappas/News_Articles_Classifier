So the idea of a “tour” — complete with bus and guide with a microphone — isn’t one I’d immediately take to.\nBut a week with Vagabond Tours of Ireland took me places I’d never find on my own, helped me experience the country in a way most never imagine (surfing, anyone?) and brought me up close with a world I quickly fell in love with.\nFive couples and I rolled out of Dublin in a Mercedes van with huge windows, with the goal of hitting Gougane Barra in Ballingeary,­ County Cork by late day. The journey included a visit to the Rock of Cashel. The famous group of medieval buildings on an outcrop of limestone in County Tipperary — including a 12th century round tower, 13th century Gothic cathedral and 15th century castle — was one of the few true tourist stops on our trip. The breath­taking view was worth it.\nGougane Barra stole my heart. A tiny village founded around A.D. 600, it is tucked into the Irish countryside and boasts a beautiful chapel and the Gougane Barra hotel, run by a most welcoming couple. The owner told tales of the region, including that of a lake “monster” named Lu. We hiked above the hotel until sunset and then, after a night in the pub and an elegant meal, a few of us stayed up for the lunar eclipse. As we looked up, the Milky Way seemed touchable thanks to the lack of light pollution, the moon became eclipsed and stars shot across the sky one after another. Silently we soaked it in. Then we heard a loud splash from behind us. We yelled out “Lu! It’s Lu!” We bought into the story.\nOur guide Darrin explained that while the tours are planned, the guides are allowed freedom to use their knowledge of the region to make each tour unique, depending on the weather and the mood of the group. So for us, that meant lots of time outdoors, from going on lush green hiking trails to sea kayaking and surfing, to simply lingering on an expansive, near-empty beach.\nThe next morning, after a full Irish breakfast and a quiet hike into the Gougane Barra Forest Park, we headed off. Our destination was the quaint Coachmans Hotel in Kenmare. On our way, Darrin steered the van off trail and took us up a rollicking “road,” way, way up high where we got a sweeping view of the valley and ocean, and visited an old stone fort, an ancient stone circle and some old copper mines. We saw no one, until a farmer with a wide smile passed us in his tractor, as if out of nowhere, with a wave.\nThat night at the Coachmans, we listened to a young accordionist serenade the room, which, on a Monday, was packed.\nEach day went on like this. We headed to the Ring of Kerry and Portmagee, a tiny seaside village. Colorful, it spans just a mile or so along the coastline and has but two pubs and one hotel. We stayed at the Moorings, where the cast and crew of the up­coming “Star Wars” film have been staying. Out in the distance looms the Skellig Islands, where we head out the next morning to climb 600 steps and visit a monastery built there circa A.D. 600.\nSkellig Michael is a famed tourist destination, and was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site. We ferried over on a fishing boat, and along the way, we spotted as many as seven whales. The trip seemed charmed. The climb up Skellig Michael is challenging and beautiful. Since we’d beaten the crowds, we took our time and soaked it in. Those “Stars Wars” folks had been filming scenes here, too.\nThe next day, we were off to Dingle, where we would spend two full days. We saw more amazing castles and visited a church and graveyard from the early first century. We learned that St. Brendan, and not Columbus, founded America (“Irish fact”). We climbed by van once again to a near impossible height. Below us, the Dingle Peninsula spread out, surrounded by a turquoise sea.\nWe sea kayaked out of the harbor and through a tall, narrow cave carved into the rocky cliffs. Then we hit the beach. This warm day, the Coumeenole Beach, named by National Geographic as one of the most beautiful spots in the world, was warm, inviting and nearly empty. Darrin decided we must linger there, and we did.\nThere was so much more. A visit to a sheep farm to learn about sheep dogs; pop-ins at tiny cafes along the way; stories of goats that saved villages and villages that preserved history. Tales of giants and heroes; history and magic; sinners and saints are all there.\nLearn more at www.vagabond­toursofireland.ie.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:50:58.341+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
