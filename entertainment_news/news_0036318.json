She never regained consciousness from a medically-induced coma and passed away in July, aged 22. \nAn initial autopsy following her death proved inconclusive, and the medical examiner's final report was sealed by court order in September. \nHowever, the aspiring actress' close pal, Danyela Bradley, has since shed a little light on the youngster's troubled final months while sitting for a deposition relating to a car accident the pair had been involved in on January 27, days before Bobbi Kristina's health emergency. \nIn the papers, obtained by editors at UsMagazine.com , Bradley claimed, \"She smoked marijuana, she probably smoked crack often, and also did heroin.\" \nBradley, who had reportedly become like \"sisters\" with Bobbi Kristina, revealed they had met through their respective boyfriends, Max Lomas and Nick Gordon, \nand the foursome had been living together in the Roswell home for about a month before the bathtub tragedy. \nBradley alleges it was only after she moved into the property that she discovered Bobbi Kristina was a regular drug user and reportedly did more than just smoke weed - although she never actually witnessed her friend use cocaine or heroin in front of her. \n\"When I first lived with her I didn't know that she had actually had a problem with (drugs) until I had lived with her... for a couple of weeks,\" she said. \"(But) I guess after a few weeks she just didn't really hide it.\" \n\"I would just visually see her physical being and I could just tell,\" she continued. She went on to claim Bobbi Kristina would become \"very sleepy, nod off\" and \"kind of keep to herself\" when she was high on heroin, while she would \"just be not even talkative\" when she allegedly smoked crack. \nBradley also touched on Bobbi Kristina's romance with Gordon, insisting they \"had a very happy, loving relationship\". Her comments contrast statements made by the tragic youth's court-appointed co-conservator, Bedelia Hargrove, who filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Gordon in July, suggesting he gave \nhis girlfriend a \"toxic cocktail\" which rendered her unconscious on the night of January 31. Hargrove also maintains the couple's relationship was volatile.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T22:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:12:11.777+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
