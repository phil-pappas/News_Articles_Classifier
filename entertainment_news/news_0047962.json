Popular Stories Local Real Estate Cars For Sale \nHARD-working Australian blues/rock act Transvaal Diamond Syndicate is stepping back into the fray with a single release, controversial clip release and national tour announcement this week. \nWith just two weeks' rest from the last six-week tour endeavour, the ex-Rockhampton band is at it again with another six weeks scheduled all over the country including first-time runs to Western Australia and the Northern Territory to support the new single. \nVisiting Rockhampton on Saturday to play the Criterion Hotel and his school reunion, lead-singer Christian Tryhorn said it was always cool coming home to play for family and friends. \n\"We're bringing a heap of new tracks and a new drummer with us this time,\" he said. \n\"I'm actually playing my 20-year Emmaus reunion on the same night so it should be a heap of fun.\" \nThe energetic trio raised more than $10,000 in 40 days recently to help cover the expenses of recording with a successful crowd-funding campaign, reaching 106% of their target in an obvious display of goodwill and support for the popular act. \nThe new single rolls into '70s psych-rock territory for the band, with guest appearances from Lachy Doley, Zed Charles and more. \nThe band, never afraid to release edgy material, has pushed the envelope once again with a track and film clip highlighting the issue of violence in society, particularly against women in a six-minute black and white epic. \nThe new sounds will feature heavily on the first EP release, The Shadow.
