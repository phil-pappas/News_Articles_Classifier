Singer has been defending Cosby in a lawsuit filed by Judy Huth, a Riverside County woman who claims Cosby forced her to perform a sex act on him at the Playboy Mansion around 1974. \nNo reason for the change is stated in the court filing. \nSinger says his firm is also being replaced on a defamation lawsuit filed by model Janice Dickinson against Cosby. \nThe development was first reported Tuesday by the Los Angeles Times. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Daily Reporter, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:34:06.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
