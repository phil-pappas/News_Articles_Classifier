The event was declared as a means to express \"outrage toward issues of sexual violence, gender inequality, derogatory labeling and victim blaming.\" The mother of one wore a black lingerie, thigh-high boots, and dark shades. The model led those people some of whom were in various states of undress to march up and down the street. At one point, she held up a sign that read, \"Strippers Have Feelings Too.\" A photo posted by Amber Rose (@amberrose) on Oct 3, 2015 at 4:24pm PDT Rose's mother also took part in the event, holding a \"F*ck Yo 30 Showers\" sign that referred to Kanye West 's jab at the tattooed model. Other signs included \"My Clothes Are Not My Consent,\" \"The Way I Dress Does Not Mean Yes,\" and \"Don't Tell Me How to Dress! Tell Them Not to Rape!!\" A photo posted by Amber Rose (@amberrose) on Oct 3, 2015 at 11:10am PDT Back in February, Kanye who is now married to Kim Kardashian dissed Rose, his former girlfriend, in a radio interview, \"It's very hard for a woman to want to be with someone that was with Amber Rose ... I had to take 30 showers before I got with Kim.\" A photo posted by Amber Rose (@amberrose) on Oct 3, 2015 at 3:04pm PDT \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T07:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T09:20:49.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
