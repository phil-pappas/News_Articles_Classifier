Chances are, you're going to be so deluged content from media companies looking to turn a buck off your Facebook nostalgia that you'll probably never want to watch the movie again. That's cool, I guess.\nBut you know what's really cool? This lucky bastard riding a hoverboard (no, not one of those ) alongside a DeLorean. On Monday night , The Gadget Show host Jason Bradbury, decked out Marty McFly's distinctive outfit, floated alongside a replica of Doc Brown's time machine to the delight of pedestrians in London's Piccadilly Square.\nAs the Daily Dot notes, those horrible pseudo-hoverboards are actually illegal in London , so we're not totally sure what contraption Bradbury's riding here. Chances are, he's simply suspended alongside the car at the torso and the board isn't really supporting him at all. Still, it's quite a site to behold.\nJust a night out on the town :) #BackToTheFuture #BTTFDay #Hoverboard pic.twitter.com/FMYogKkeDm\n— Jason Bradbury (@JasonBradbury) October 19, 2015\nWhat we do know is this: This is the only Back to the Future Facebook kitsch worth watching today. Now turn off your computer before the internet ruins a movie classic for you.\nTwo fashionistas rocking that futuristic style @LeighFrancis & @therealgokwan #KeithLemonBTTF :) pic.twitter.com/UHu1FRyGJl\n— Jason Bradbury (@JasonBradbury) October 20, 2015", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/FCm5QNYV1CE", "https://t.co/UHu1FRyGJl", "http://www.dailydot.com/politics/hoverboard-illegal-london/", "https://t.co/FMYogKkeDm", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/KeithLemonBTTF?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/BTTFDay?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/JasonBradbury/status/656414949804253184", "https://twitter.com/therealgokwan", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Hoverboard?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/LeighFrancis", "https://twitter.com/JasonBradbury/status/656230071242502144", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/BackToTheFuture?src=hash"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T18:09:26.389+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
