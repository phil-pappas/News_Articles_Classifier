The State Award-winner recently waltzed into the Kannada film industry in style, starring with Shivarajkumar in Kabira. Sanusha, who has almost finished shooting for the movie, shares her experiences in Sandalwood and more...\nHow did you get the role? I had met Shivarajkumar sir's wife, Geetha ma'am, at an award function and she suggested my name. She recognized me as the actress of the Tamil film Renigunta. Apparently, Kabira's team has been searching for a leading lady for two years and she felt that I would be apt for the role.\nHow was it working with Shivarajkumar? He is someone I admire both as an actor and a person. He has amazing patience and professionalism. There is a scene in which he is immersed into water, for which the shooting went on for quite a while, drowning and lifting him up from water numerous times. He kept giving the shots sans a body double, without any starry airs.\nTell us your experience on the film's set... I was silent for the first few days as I didn't speak Kannada. After sensing that the crew is friendly and helpful, I started interacting with them, but they insisted that I speak only in Kannada. I have picked up the language a bit, but lose the flow when I become conscious.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:13:01.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
