She says it all started with strange experiences that peaked her interest.\n\"I had a few paranormal things happen to me that were unexplainable,\" said Decker.\nOn Saturday, Decker joined more than 100 people for the 2nd annual Ghostacular Paranormal Convention or ParaCon in downtown Burlington.\n\"I did the aura photo, and that was really cool, because it brought up a lot of stuff about...personal stuff about me that's been going on in colors, and she explained it and that was really neat,\" said Decker.\nThe convention brought together paranormal enthusiasts, investigators, and more than 25 venders offering everything from tarot card readings and massages to Big Foot researchers.\n\"Amy Bruni from Ghost Hunters was our main speaker this year. It's just a really great, great event,\" said Michele Nappi, organizer.\nOne group called Champ Search talked to guests about their experiences searching for the mythical Lake Champlain monster.\n“Champ is out there, and I would consider it probably an endangered species, but it is protected by the state,” said Dennis Hall, with Champ Search.\n\"We've been staying out on the lake overnight, and we've actually recorded many vocalizations of multiple animals communicating back and forth,\" said Katy Elizabeth, also with Champ Search.\nOrganizers say the event not only brings fans and believers together, but it is a chance for the paranormal groups to network. One group investigates multiple requests per month to investigate unexplainable, potentially haunted places at the request of home owners and others in Vermont.\n\"We don't come in and hold hands and chant or anything like that. We are data driven, and we don't tend to, we don't claim to cleanse anything, but we're here to verify if you feel there is something going on,” said Betty Dupont, Paranormal Investigators of New England.\nDecker says the best part of the convention was the social and educational aspect that it had.\n\"It's just great to be around people who are interested in the paranormal, the unexplainable stuff, and so you get to learn a lot,\" said Decker.\nA lot -- about the unknown.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:59:35.238+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
