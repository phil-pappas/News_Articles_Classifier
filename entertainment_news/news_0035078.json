Fox and Christopher Lloyd; never-before-seen photos; and replica items like a photo of Marty McFly with his siblings, and a Save the Clocktower leaflet. \nWhile putting together the book, Klastorin had access to the Back to the Future archives of director Robert Zemeckis, producer-writer Bob Gale, and Universal Studios. \"I spent many days going through every single photo that was taken on all of the trilogy, as well as stuff from the animated series, the theme park attraction,\" he tells ABC Radio. \nAs evidenced on October 21, Back to the Future Day -- honoring the date that Marty and Doc Brown traveled to in the second movie -- the popularity of the franchise remains strong. Klastorin says there's a reason for that. \n\"Michael J. Fox said that he believes -- and I certainly agree with him -- that this movie is cross-generational,\" he explains. \"And the people who loved it when they first saw it grew up, they introduced their kids to it, their kids loved it, and it goes so on and so on and so on. And I like to say that this movie about time travel is timeless.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T09:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:20:54.619+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
