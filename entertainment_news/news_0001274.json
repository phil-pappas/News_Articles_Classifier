But every time I see him now, before I even speak to him, he goes, ‘I’m not touring’ and I say, I’m not asking.\n\"He has decided to retire and, like Phil Collins, you can’t demand these people go out there again and again and again. I’m really pleased and proud that the last show he ever did in the U.K. was the 2004 Isle Of Wight Festival.”\nBowie's last live gigs were in 2004 when he was promoting ' Reality' . He was scheduled to play the Oxegen festiva l that year but cancelled the remainder of the tour after it was revealed that he had to undergo heart surgery.\nNonetheless, he has continued to record and release music and recently wrote the theme song for new Sky TV series 'The Last Panthers '.\nMORE: Watch: David Bowie has revealed theme song for Sky Atlantic's The Last Panthers\nMORE: David Bowie records the title track for upcoming Sky Atlantic TV series\nMORE: A SpongeBob musical is in the works - and Aerosmith, Flaming Lips & DAVID BOWIE are on board", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/4B5zmDz4vR4"], "published": "2015-10-12T19:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:18:12.432+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
