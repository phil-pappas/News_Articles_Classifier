Abrams broke his silence on the movement launched against \" Star Wars: The Force Awakens \" on Twitter. The upcoming movie was blasted by Internet trolls for being \"anti-white\" and a movement to boycott the film with hashtag \"#BoycottStarWarsVII\" was launched. One tweet accused \"Star Wars\" of being an \"anti-white propaganda promoting #whitegenocide.\" Abrams then responded in a note just before the new trailer was out, \"We cannot wait to share the trailer with you tonight. I don't care if you're black, white, brown, jawa, wookiee, jedi, or sith. I just hope you like it!\" — Bad Robot (@bad_robot) October 20, 2015 The movie is set to make its way out across the United States on December 18. John Boyega and Daisy Ridley are tapped to play the new heroes while Adam Driver is to play the new villain.
