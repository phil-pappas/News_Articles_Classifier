Simon then told him to leave the ITV competition. \nSeann, who has made it through to the Judges’ Houses round with mentor Nick Grimshaw, admitted Mason should not have argued with Simon – but is relieved that another rival is now out. \nHe said: “That was crazy, right? He ruined it because he was so talented – but it helped me because I thought he was pretty good competition. When he left the stage, I was like, ‘Thank you Lord Almighty’.” \nThe Australian singer, 24, joins Nick’s other acts – Tom Bleasby, Josh Daniel, Che Chesterton, Ben Clark and Simon Lynch – after he impressed the judges with his rendition of Shirley Bassey’s I Who Have Nothing, dressed in seven inch heels and a revealing wrap-dress. \n“It’s amazing. It’s been a crazy ride to be here, you know, especially to be who I am on that stage,” he said.

I didn’t realise how brutal the Six Chair challenge was, but I just went in there to get a seat. I think it helped me in my favour,” he recalled. \nSeann is now backing himself for X Factor victory.

I think the X Factor crown would go great with my outfit,” he said. \n“My dream is ‘Seann Miley Moore, live at Madison Square Garden’ and I think this is the first thing in order to achieve those dreams. It’s a one in a million chance and I believe in myself that I’m that one in a million. I’m going to win it, I’m going to be the X Factor 2015 winner.” Share article \nThe X Factor continues on Sundays on ITV.
