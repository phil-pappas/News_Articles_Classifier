The original book has been paired with \"Life and Death,\" a narrative that reverses the author's famed romance between a teen girl and male vampire, instead having a human boy (Beau) fall for a female vampire (Edythe).\nAccording to Little, Brown, the alternate version contains nearly 400 pages of new material. As of late Tuesday morning, the book was in the top 500 on Amazon.com's best-seller list.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
