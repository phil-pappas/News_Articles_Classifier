SoulFest was scheduled to take place in Auckland Monday 26th October after the Australian dates. \nFull refunds will be made to all ticket purchasers: \nFor all tickets booked online or by phone, the credit card used in the booking will automatically be refunded. Please allow up to 14 days to receive your refund. \nIf the original credit card you used for the purchase has been cancelled or no longer valid please contact place of purchase. \nIf you made your booking at an outlet please return to the original outlet where the booking was made with your ticket(s) and credit card used to purchase in hand to obtain your refund. Refunds will only be provided to the original purchaser on presentation of photo ID. \nSoulFest was launched with the intention of promoting specific genres of music, such as Neo-Soul, RnB and Hip-Hop, and SoulFest 2014 successfully delivered some of the most exciting talent within these genres. \nDespite a stellar line-up of artists and the best promotional endeavours on SoulFestâ€™s behalf, the event has simply not received the support via ticket sales, and the financial loss that would be incurred by the event if it were to go ahead as planned would be devastating. \nThere have been many people working behind the scenes, including media partners, artists, sponsors, sub-contracted promoters, communication managers, agents and suppliers who live, breathe and support this incredible genre of music and have worked tirelessly to try and make this event a success. \nThe promoter of SoulFest International Australia, John Denison, sincerely apologizes to all involved who have dedicated 7 months of their lives to work on this festival, and to the supporters of the event who purchased tickets. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
