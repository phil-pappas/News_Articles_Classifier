The judge agreed after both sides said they wanted the case put on hold while Pruitt investigates how the state twice got the wrong drug.\nPlay Video CBS Evening News Supreme Court upholds use of execution drug In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that a controversial drug used in lethal injections should remain legal to use. Jan Crawford reports o...\nThe agreement came the same day that officials in Arkansas -- where a judge halted all scheduled executions last week -- asked the state Supreme Court to allow lethal injections to resume next week. Inmates there are challenging a state law that allows prison officials not to disclose where they get execution drugs . Oklahoma has a similar law.\nThe latest investigation into Oklahoma executions came after Gov. Mary Fallin called off the execution of Richard Glossip just hours before his lethal injection was scheduled to begin on Sept. 30. Fallin stepped in when prison officials discovered they had potassium acetate instead of potassium chloride, the specified final drug in Oklahoma's three-drug lethal injection process.\nA week later, a newly released autopsy report showed that Oklahoma used potassium acetate to execute Charles Warner in January, contradicting what the state publicly said it had used. Warner had originally been scheduled to die in April 2014, the same night as Clayton Lockett, who writhed and moaned before dying 43 minutes after his initial injection. Lockett's botched execution also prompted the state to put executions on hold amid an investigation.\nPlay Video CBS Evening News Supreme Court debates execution drugs, death penalty The U.S. Supreme Court got heated as lawyers presented arguments in a case involving execution drugs. The justices engaged in a spirited debate a...\nThe Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals has issued indefinite stays for Glossip and two other inmates who were set for execution this year.\nFriday's court filing said Pruitt won't request any execution dates until at least 150 days after his investigation is complete, the results are made public, and his office receives notice that the prisons department can comply with the state's execution protocol.\n\"My office does not plan to ask the court to set an execution date until the conclusion of its investigation,\" Pruitt said in a statement.\nAn attorney for the inmates didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.\nThe autopsy report prepared after Warner's execution on Jan. 15 said the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner received two syringes labeled \"potassium chloride,\" but that the vials used to fill the syringes were labeled \"single dose Potassium Acetate Injection.\" The execution log said the state used potassium chloride to stop Warner's heart, according to a copy obtained by The Associated Press.\\\nPlay Video CBS This Morning Botched execution takes two hours in Arizona prison Typically a ten to 15 minute process, it took nearly two hours for convicted murderer Joseph Wood to die after the administration of his lethal i...\nThe next inmate scheduled to die was Glossip, but the governor stepped in after learning that a pharmacist -- whose identity is shielded by state law -- had given the prison potassium acetate. Prison authorities contacted the supplier, \"whose professional opinion was that potassium acetate is medically interchangeable with potassium chloride at the same quantity,\" Oklahoma prisons director Robert Patton said at the time.\nBut experts on pharmaceuticals and chemistry told the AP that differences between the two forms could be relevant. They noted that potassium chloride is more quickly absorbed by the body and that more potassium acetate may be needed to achieve the same effect.\nQuestions about execution drugs also prompted the delay in Arkansas, where a judge has delayed all eight of the state's scheduled lethal injections through January. Death row inmates filed a lawsuit alleging the state's secrecy law violates a contract in an earlier settlement with prisoners that required information about execution drugs be released to inmates.\nIn Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Wolf imposed a moratorium earlier this year. Calling the system of capital punishment error-prone and expensive, Wolf said the moratorium would remain in effect at least until he receives a report from a legislative commission that has been studying the topic for about four years.\nIn August, a federal judge temporarily blocked the state of Mississippi from using two drugs in executions, shutting down the death penalty in the state for now.\nU.S. District Judge Henry T. Wingate issued a temporary restraining order saying Mississippi officials cannot use pentobarbital or midazolam, two drugs used to render prisoners unconscious.", "external_links": ["http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/24/668ed96a-f7c0-40f6-90b4-b96907f000cd/thumbnail/220x140/51ff7b1ddf8b27006d75710f5a9ee4b9/ctm0724execution256600640x360.jpg", "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/04/29/10f92351-ff76-48ec-b5fe-cea5655e25a3/thumbnail/220x140/21cf76347c84b8233be18256ccd9270f/en0429crawford385467640x360.jpg", "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/06/29/4937d976-b317-4048-9976-a9fd30ff05da/thumbnail/220x140/83f55ea57e5c9dbc9e25c9caadd6220b/en0629lethalinjections4414150640x360.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-17T02:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:26:26.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
