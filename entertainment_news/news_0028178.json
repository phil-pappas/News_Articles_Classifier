At the height of ballet's relevance and popularity in the 1970s and '80s, said Copeland, the ideal female ballerina was whippet slim.\n\"I think we are still trying to get rid of that. There are so many dancers at ABT who have healthy bodies and curves and breasts.\"\nCopeland, who is muscular and curvy, was instructed to lose weight when she began at ABT. Other African-American dancers have been told over the years they just didn't have the body to be a dancer in the company.\n\"To me, it's code for you don't have the right skin color,\" said Copeland. \"That has been a lot of the minority dancers' experience. They are told they don't have the right body.\"\nWhen she began filming \"A Ballerina's Tale\" in 2013, Copeland had no idea she would ever dance again. In 2012 when she was a soloist, Copeland became the ABT's first black ballerina to play the iconic role in Stravinsky's \"Firebird.\" The documentary captures her electrifying performance at the Metropolitan Opera House.\nBut after the performance, Copeland revealed she had been performing in enormous pain.\nShe soon discovered that she had six fractures in her left shin and had to have surgery.\nThe film's director, Nelson George, who is friends with the ballerina, saw her in \"Firebird.\" \"He fell in love with it and said we have to do something together,\" Copeland said.\n\"When she was in full recovery mode, I approached her about doing a documentary,\" said George. \"She was kind of going through a dark period when she was trying to figure out what her next move was. This was a unique opportunity to document a great artist coming from a high of 'Firebird' to wherever she was going to go to. \"\n\"A Ballerina's Tale,\" said Copeland, \"started with Nelson and his single camera, and it slowly evolved. He filmed for a little over two years just waiting for an ending to happen. When I was cast in 'Swan Lake' in Australia, we said that's going to be our ending.\"\nThough ABT's new season doesn't begin until the spring in New York, Copeland's been told she'll be dancing some new roles, \"but I'm not sure what they are. I will do 'Swan Lake' again.\"\nPerforming \"On the Town\" in late summer for two weeks made Copeland a better dancer and a strong performer \"with more of an understanding of taking on a character,\" she said. \"I wanted to challenge myself. Then when I was preparing -- I didn't have a lot of time -- I was just so freaked out. I haven't really been nervous about being onstage in a long time.\"\nIt was the unknown that shook her confidence. \"It was not knowing how I was going to do and not feeling completely prepared to sing in front of people and speak. But after the third show, I just fell in love with it. I'm so thankful that I did it.\"\n(c)2015 Los Angeles Times\nVisit the Los Angeles Times at www.latimes.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1742537&h=Misty+Copeland+rose+to+the+top+of+the+ballet+world%2C+now+her+talents+are+seen+in+%27A+Ballerina%27s+Tale%27", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1742537&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1742537"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:27:47.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
