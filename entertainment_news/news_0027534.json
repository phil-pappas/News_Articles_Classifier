Threshold Radio is broadcast from 8AM to 10AM Pacific Standard Time on VegasAllNetRadio.com, an Internet Radio Station in Las Vegas. Patricia’s dramatic abilities and extraordinary range and style has captivated audiences for years- and her story is fascinating, filled with the drama of any aspiring singer who ultimately makes it to Broadway, Las Vegas and to work directly with actor, Yul Brynner, celebrated singer, Robert Goulet and one of America’s great performers, Wayne Newton.\nThe program will be filled with both old vintage favorites like “Do You Know Where You’re Going,” “Fly Me to the Moon,” and “Misty” from her new 3-part CD, “Cocktails, Dinner and Dessert with Patricia ” while sharing memories and stories from a show business career that she actively sought at a very young age. Trained in classical performance by former Metropolitan Opera Star, Francis Yeend, Patricia has triumphantly managed to master many genres of music, including country, rock, opera and show tunes as well as contemporary pop hits as featured in her vintage album, including her love of patriotic music as can be seen in the current Threshold promo.\nThreshold Radio Host, Johnny Blue Star, has worked as an author, freelance writer and songwriter for many years and has developed Threshold, in part, to feature various musical performers and songwriters who exemplify a spiritual quality and interest in their music, the kind of music that serves as a link between different cultures and countries.\nHe says, “The musical division of my company, New Galaxy Enterprises, is called Bridge of Light Productions- and, for quite a number of years, Patricia Welch has worked with me, as a lyricist and my associate and colleague, Edgar Arens, a Russian composer living in Moscow. We believe our music has a certain quality that spans many cultures. Our first song- and the only song available at this moment on YouTube, is called “ Christmas in Your Eyes ,” which celebrates the universal love for the holiday, felt throughout the world. The way Patricia, I and Edgar got together is quite extraordinary and Patricia will discuss this on our show.”\nThe show will share a selection clips from a new forthcoming song, “The Palm Springs Lullaby” written by Johnny Blue Star and Edgar Arens as well as some clips from their forthcoming album, featuring Patricia Welch, “Hadleigh’s Castle.”\nJoin Johnny Blue Star and Patricia Welch on Threshold Radio on www.VegasAllNetRadio.com at 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM Pacific Time on Saturday, October 3, 2015.
