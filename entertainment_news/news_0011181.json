Following Balfe’s comments about just how good O’Donoghue looks in a kilt, Heughan apparently wants a TV divorce. \nThe playful rivalry between Heughan and O’Donoghue began a few months back when the two squared off in Radio Time’s Sci Fi Champion quarter finals. While fans showed up in mass online to vote for their favorite star Heughan bet O’Donoghue that if he beat him then he’d have to wear a kilt. \nNot one to go back on a friendly wager, O’Donoghue recently posted a short clip on Twitter of himself in a full, Outlander style kilt. “Never let it be said I shy away from a challenge,” he said in the video before giving fans a view of his traditional Scottish attire. \nIn response to his post, Balfe immediately took to Twitter and admitted that O’Donoghue wore the kilt even better than Heughan. “@colindonoghe1 @Outlander_Starz @OnceABC @eonline I think you wear it even better than @SamHeughan?? #sorryhubby #walkingawayquickly,” she wrote. \nWhile O’Donoghue thanked Balfe for her kind words, Heughan was clearly not pleased with his television wife. “Divorce. No more Outlander ,” he wrote on his Twitter account. \nDespite her initial comments, it should be noted that Balfe at least tried to redeem herself. “@SamHeughan @colinodonoghue1 @Outlander_Starz @OnceABC @eonline but no-one looks as good out of a kilt as you… anybetter? #oohdembuns,” she posted after Heughan’s response to her other comments. \nSam Heughan and Caitriona Balfe play Jamie and Claire Fraser on ‘Outlander’ [Image Courtesy: Starz] Meanwhile, friendly rivalries aside, the two Outlander stars are currently gearing up for season two of the hit series. With Frank Randall (Tobias Menzies) expected to make another appearance on the show, many are starting to speculate that the relationship between Claire and Jamie may be facing tough times ahead. \nThe second season of Outlander is based off the second book in Diana Gabaldon’s award winning series, titled Dragonfly in Amber . Although the show is expected to feature a number of new characters as Jamie and Claire head to France to prevent the Battle of Culloden, it was recently revealed that Menzies would be returning to the show, and not just as Claire’s husband, Frank. \nIn fact, Jamie’s old nemesis from season one, Black Jack, is also set to make a cameo in season two. According to images released by the Christian Post , Black Jack and Jamie will be facing off in an intense battle scene, which seems to indicate that Black Jack survived the events that occurred at the end of season one. \nMany fans will recall that at the end of the first season Black Jack was trampled and presumably left to die from his wounds. However, the new images from the set of season two show Jamie and Black Jack in an intense sword fighting scene. This leaves open the question of whether or not Jamie will finally get his revenge and finish up Black Jack for good. \nSam Heughan returns as Jamie Fraser in season 2 of ‘Outlander’ in spring 2016. [Image Courtesy: Starz] At the same time, Carter Matt has revealed that Frank will be included in this season, which might put an additional strain on Claire relationship with Jamie. With Jamie clearly set to go through a number of challenges as he faces down his past demons, it isn’t clear how all of this will affect his relationship with Claire. \nHopefully, Jamie’s fight with Black Jack ends favorably for him and he gets some sort of closure after everything that happened to him last season. Either way, his relationship with Claire is sure to be tested as the two face down their new set of challenges. \nThe new season of Outlander is expected to return to Starz in early 2016. \n[Lead Image Courtesy: Starz]", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:38:10.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
