Each evening will begin with a presentation about Zimmermann's paranormal findings on past investigations of Boscobel and other Hudson Valley locations, and will take place in the Carriage House at Boscobel. Zimmermann personally researches and uncovers startling evidence of the existence of ghosts throughout the tri-state area, which she discusses in a lively style. Advance ticket purchase is required.
