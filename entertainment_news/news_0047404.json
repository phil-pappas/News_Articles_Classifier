Gatewood is one of UNCG’s most famous alums, who became one of Caswell County’s most successful daughters. A new exhibition, “Remembering Maud: A Selection of Her Paintings,” will be on view at the Weatherspoon Art Gallery until Nov. 8. Other groups that own her work are displaying it as well this fall, including Elon University and the Yanceyville Museum of Art. The exhibits are part of the “Maud Gatewood Trail” that spans from Charlotte to Danville, Va. Gatewood was the daughter of Caswell County Sheriff Yancey Gatewood, and while she was famous worldwide for her paintings, she chose to remain in North Carolina to paint. She also was a Caswell County Commissioner. Gatewood died in in 2004 at age 70. UNCG describes her as “a painter, teacher, activist and staunch individualist.” “She delighted viewers, inspired students, supported organizations and served as a role model for how to participate in a world of images and ideas,” the university said. While much of her work focused on landscape and architecture, UNCG says that she painted in a variety of styles. A 2005 IndyWeek article called her “salty, hard drinking and smoking,” and portrayed her as a Southerner to the core who was not afraid to speak her mind, a trait that shows up in some of her strongest works. “As to her most well-known work, her paintings of the Australian bungle formations are reproduced quite a bit, but I think some of her politically based work is quite strong,” said Nancy M. Doll, director of the Weatherspoon Art Museum. “Maud was an original,” said Will South, the former curator of collections at Weatherspoon and now the chief curator at the Columbia Museum of Art in South Carolina. “She doesn’t owe much of anything to the regional art that preceded her. Intellectually, her art training at Women’s College was foundational in that her instructor, Greg Ivy, opened her up to the idea that art was an attitude toward living that could and should spill into one’s civic life, philosophical life and spiritual life. Maud took that to heart. As a teacher and later as a county commissioner, she was always creative, open, and again in the way of great artists, skilled in her process.” The exhibition at the Weatherspoon Art Museum at 500 Tate St. in Greensboro is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.. Monday through Friday, with extended hours until 8 p.m. on Thursdays. It is open 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays. Her works are on permanent display at the Yanceyville Museum of Art. Page 2 of 3 - COMMENTS ON MAUD GATEWOOD Dr. Will South recently gave a lecture at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro about Caswell County artist Maud Gatewood. Here are some of the things he said about her in response to questions from the Times-News. •“There is no ‘School of Maud’ in terms of folks following her various styles. Her influence came more by way of force of personality, and through impressing others with her creativity in a way that did not lead to imitators. For starters, Maud’s main body of work consists of large works made of layers of intensive airbrush stencils, oftentimes with 3-D elements. Trying to copy Maud would be both obvious and really difficult. So, while many have been floored by her out-sized canvases, they are not something easily replicated.” •“It’s important to remember that Maud came up in the world at a time when opportunities for women were limited. At Women’s College, in the art department, the idea that you went to college to get an Mrs. degree was not popular. You came to college for an education, and, even if you couldn’t support yourself as a full-time artist, you were going to learn what made art important, and that was that art represented our individual and cultural aspirations, and showed the best that we can be.” •“Maud was tough. You hear a lot of people say that about lots of people, but in Maud’s case, it is not only true it is probably an understatement. She had no tolerance for phonies, no interest in nonsense, which is not to say she couldn’t have a good time. She enjoyed travel, drinking, smoking (which was nigh unto a religion for her) and friends. She was a fascinating conversationalist, having traveled the world and thought about what she saw and experienced. Maud didn’t shrink from life’s challenges, but rather turned them into learning.” SITES ON THE MAUD GATEWOOD TRAIL The Maud Gatewood Trail has been organized around the exhibition of Gatewood’s work at the Art Department Gallery at UNC-Greensboro.
