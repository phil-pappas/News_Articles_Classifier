In fact, this is not a team of people at all.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151012/275980\n\"Actually, to see this team in action, you have to travel very far. They are the emperor penguins who live in Antarctica , the true miracle on ice,\" said Antarctic Mike, author of the new book \" The Penguin Principle: A Little Story About True Teamwork \" ( Indie Books International , 2015).\nPerhaps you witnessed these magnificent creatures in the 2005 Academy Award-winning movie, \"March of the Penguins.\" With narration by Morgan Freeman , the film is a look at the annual journey of emperor penguins as they march-single file-to their traditional breeding ground.\n\"In my trips to Antarctica I have had the privilege to observe these amazing birds that I call the world's best performing team in the worst conditions on earth,\" said Antarctic Mike.\n\"But how did it all begin? This book is a little fable with an important message for every organization in the world,\" said Antarctic Mike. \"These penguins have as much to teach us about being a great team as any group that exists in the world.\"\nIn January 2006 , Antarctic Mike became one of nine people to have run a marathon on the Antarctic continent. Eleven months later he returned to Antarctica to become the first American to complete the Antarctica Ultra Marathon, a grueling 100 kilometers (62.1 miles).\nSince then Antarctic Mike has completed many other winter marathons in the coldest and harshest climates on earth. His stories have been featured in Sports Illustrated and on CNN, Fox, ABC, CBS, ESPN and many other national and international media outlets.\nThe book shares ten teamwork gifts any team can receive from the example of the emperor penguins:\nThe gift of meaningful purpose The gift of embracing the unknown The gift of collective commitment The gift of unbreakable trust The gift of serious sacrifice The gift of consistent activity The gift of active listening The gift of creative innovation The gift of a true tribe The gift of lasting legacy Antarctic Mike has a 20-year background in the recruiting business, where he helped many companies find great employees. Now he spends most of his time helping companies engage and retain great employees through his speeches, workshops and consulting.\nAbout Indie Books International\nIndie Books International ( www.indiebooksintl.com ) was founded in 2014 in Oceanside, California by two best-selling business authors.
