I’ve been a Unicef ambassador since I was 17. It’s so disappointing that I’ve become a tabloid story.” \nSelena admitted that criticism of her body on the internet earlier this year was hurtful. “I was in a bikini and got publicly ripped for being overweight,” she said.

When somebody else has your self-esteem in their hands…” \nBut anger inspired her new album Revival, she explained: “The hate motivated me. \nAnd she added: “This is my time. I’ve deserved this. I earned it. This is all me.” Share article \nRevival is released on Friday, October 9.
