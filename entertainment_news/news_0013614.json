Spielberg, as a Hollywood titan who does almost every kind of film, is the Frank Capra of his age. \nSpielberg now has the Cold War drama Bridge of Spies in theatres, with his pal Tom Hanks back on the marquee and an Oscar campaign underway . In stark contrast, Spielberg is now in post-production after shooting an adaptation of Roald Dahl’s children’s book, The BFG, in Vancouver. This fantasy adventure features gifted British actor Mark Rylance (the Soviet spy in Bridge of Spies) as The Big Friendly Giant. \nOnly a few established American directors can boast of such leaps of faith, one that Spielberg takes repeatedly. While we love him for his classic mainstream entertainments — especially Jaws (1975), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) —we admire Spielberg for exploring the human condition, too. \nSo, in honour of the worthiness of Bridge of Spies, we offer our list of the five best serious dramas the 68-year-old filmmaker made before going Cold War on us. But first a note on what he said last week about historical projects: \n“It’s so amazing when you can actually reach out and touch the people who were touched by the great work of James Donovan,” Spielberg said, referring to Hanks’ real-life character, an American lawyer at the heart of the story. Spielberg collaborated with the families of both Donovan and Francis Gary Powers, the spy-plane pilot shot down by the Soviets in 1960. He layered in factual scenes based on insights he gleaned from them, such as the death-defying attempt Powers made to destroy his U-2 plane before he parachuted down. \nNormally, says Spielberg, “it’s really scary because, when I make a movie about something that happened in history, there is no one to tell the tale except historians.” \nSpielberg’s Best Serious Dramas: \n• Schindler’s List (1993): \nFeeling guilty about his own childhood ambivalence over growing up as an Orthodox Jew, the mature Spielberg felt empowered when he explored this harrowing Holocaust tale. Bringing a keen sensitivity into play, Spielberg created a cinematic classic starring Liam Neeson as real-life Oskar Schindler, an ethnic German who saved Polish Jews from Nazi gas chambers. Ralph Fiennes brilliantly embodies the horrifying moral bankruptcy at the other extreme in playing SS officer Amon Goeth. Spielberg finally won his first best director Oscar (it was absurd he had to wait that long). The film won seven Oscars in total, including best picture. \n• Saving Private Ryan (1998): \nWhile the core story is fictional — albeit loosely inspired by a real-life saga — Spielberg’s WWII drama is savagely real in its depiction of 20th century war. In fact, the first 20 minutes, which depicts the Omaha Beach landing by U.S. troops during the Allied invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944, is the most terrifying battle sequence ever filmed, precisely because it is so authentic. Spielberg earned his second best director Oscar, one of five the film won. Shockingly, it lost to Shakespeare in Love as best picture. \n• The Color Purple (1985): \nLike Saving Private Ryan, this drama is not fact-based history. Instead, inspired by the Alice Walker novel, it is historical fiction that is so real, so intense and so achingly accurate to its time period that it makes its story come alive. Set in the South in a segregated America from 1909 to 1937, the film chronicles how a poverty-stricken woman (Whoopi Goldberg) endures abuse and racism to eventually triumph. The film generated 11 Oscar noms but, bizarrely, won none (a record it holds with 1977’s The Turning Point). \n• Amistad (1997): \nThis slave era film, which explores what happened during and after the 1839 mutiny on board the slave transportation ship La Amistad, is enormously underappreciated. While it is rife with historical inaccuracies — as are many historical dramas — the film does something important that critic Roger Ebert championed so vigorously at the time: “It provides faces and names for its African characters, whom the movies so often make into faceless victims.” The film earned four Oscar noms but no wins. \n• Munich (2005): \nThis vengeance drama recounts how Israeli assassins secretly went after Palestinians who were involved with the Munich massacre at the 1972 Summer Olympics. As well as working as a taut action thriller, the film is a deep and often unsettling dive into political and moral complexity. Given current events in the Middle East, the film remains relevant and worthy of ongoing debate. The film earned five Oscar noms but no wins. \n• Honourable Mentions: \nThe Terminal (2004); Catch Me if You Can (2002); War Horse (2011); Empire of the Sun (1987); and — only because Daniel Day-Lewis is brilliant as Honest Abe — the otherwise plodding Lincoln (2012). \nTwitter: @Bruce_Kirkland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:09:50.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
