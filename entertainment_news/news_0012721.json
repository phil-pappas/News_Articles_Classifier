They figure once they take possession of their own chunk of nature, nature will take care of them, no questions asked. \nBut since I know a fair bit about how to grow my own food, and more than most about what's for lunch in the wilds of Alabama, I think I should share this with you before you actually have to apply your survival skills: If you can't do a decent job of growing your own food in your own yard in town, you don't stand a prayer of growing it way off in the middle of nowhere. I was thinking about this today, as I prepared for my own mini-apocalypse by planting four kinds of broccoli, four kinds of kale and two varieties of mustard in my winter garden bed, just outside my backdoor in the middle of Midtown Mobile. It has always been my view that when civilization stumbles to a halt, one should have as many broccoli varieties to choose from as possible. \nThe amazing thing about this little sliver of winter garden, maybe 15 feet wide and 15 to 20 feet long, is that I'll be eating out of it almost every day for the next six or seven months, whether Trump maintains his lead in the polls or not. A Gulf Coast garden full of broccoli and kale. (Bill Finch, Press-Register) Bill Finch \nIn addition to the aforementioned broccolis, kales and mustards, there'll be four kinds of onions, three kinds of carrots, five kinds of radish, two or three varieties of lettuce, two kinds of arugula and two of garlic, along with parsley, cilantro, fava beans, and oh yes, there will once again be chard. The artichokes I planted last year are back for round two, and so are the cardoons. I'll have to give much of it away to my neighbors, simply because I can't possibly eat all I grow in that little bit of space. \nGardeners who have more space than this usually don't produce nearly as much, because it's such a chore to tend that much space and keep the soil in good shape. \nMy gardens are always extraordinarily productive and need little tending or watering because I create my own super-duper topsoil using what comes naturally: Tree leaves and compost that have always been integral to the creation of topsoil. \nTopsoil as good as mine is now rare even in the wildest of woods. \nIf by chance you were to find soil this rich in the country, and you didn't mind cutting all the trees and removing the stumps to get to it, don't expect it will last more than a year or two. Alabama soils are almost all easily worn-out tropical soils that begin to break down the moment you plow them. The soil in the country is just like the soil in the city: It needs copious additions of organic matter every year. And the ironic truth is, it's easier to get that organic matter in the city, from the leaves your neighbors left bagged on the street, than it is to get it in the country. \nWhile you're figuring out how to find enough organic matter to keep your deep country garden growing while Congress smolders and Washington burns, you probably should think about where your water comes from and how you're going to apply it. You'll certainly need to figure out how to keep the deer and rabbits from mowing everything down to nubbins (since I garden in Midtown, that's not something I have to worry with very often). \nYou'll also need to know which plants are best started in pots and which in the ground, and what your true seasons are, and why you should plant lettuce, greens and carrots and so much else in fall (not spring), and how to harvest tomatoes before the mid-summer rains destroy the crop, and what you need to do to dodge disease and insects. \nHere's what I'm saying: Don't think that nature is going to take care of you just because you bought a piece of land. Nature won't take care of you. But you may one day be able to take care of yourself and your family when you really began to understand nature, and how to take advantage of what it offers. You can do that in your own yard as well as, or better than, you can do it in some deep woods hideout. \nAnd I advise you to get started figuring all this out as soon as possible. Facebook says that civilization as we know it will be coming to an end any day now, and a lot of you folks are going to be might hungry when it does. \nNeed vegetables to feed you and your family this winter?
