A number of factors make the 1940s and 1950s interesting, said Channy Lyons, founder and organizer of the symposium. “What happened in the ’40s and ’50s led to the ’60s and ’70s when the Chicago art scene really changed,” said Lyons. “It was the first time that Chicago really had its own sense of art, it’s own art scene.” The 1940s and 1950s were a pivotal time when Midwestern artists, isolated from the mainstream art world on the east and west coasts, were developing their artistic vocabulary. “Particularly for women, who are somewhat marginalized in the art world anyway, they don’t have art critics of the East Coast holding up standards,” said Lyons. “So here they are having a great time developing their own personal way of making art.” Midwestern women artists weren’t sticking to any particular trend, and because the work they created was so idiosyncratic, it had a lot of impact later on. Women in the 1940s and 1950s also paved the way for a later generation of female artists, said Lyons. “They formed groups and co-ops to teach other women how to write resumes and make slides — how to market their work,” Lyons said. The fact that the period has not been often displayed has made tracking down artwork more difficult, said Lyons. But one thing that’s helped is the fact that a number of the artists are still alive, and some are still working. “You can go online and look at videos that really give you a good sense of what they are about,” said Lyons, who recruited several artists to attend the symposium, including Linda Kramer, co-founder of Chicago’s Artemisia Gallery, a cooperative for women artists, and Suellen Rocca, a member of the Hairy Who, one of the original Chicago Imagists’ art collectives. Gerda Meyer Bernstein was also planning to attend, but an injury forced her to withdraw. Meyer Bernstein began showing her work at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1954 and is today internationally known for addressing thorny global issues. Her artwork is still being shown at the Hartman Gallery on the Bradley University campus. “She is very much into reminding people of the inhumanities that we see every day,” said Lyons. “At Hartman, her artwork consists of 22 bodies, women shrouded in burlap. They are all in a circle with their feet pointing inward. The artwork is showing that women are not treated as they should be.” Page 2 of 2 - Hartman is only one local art venue that symposium attendees will visit. The Symposium’s main exhibit, “Making their Mark: Illinois Women Artists 1940-1960” is at the Riverfront Museum, but galleries all over town are featuring artwork made by women — The Prairie Center of the Arts is hosting “Send a Postcard to Barbara; The Studios on Sheridan is hosting “Me,” an exhibition of self-portraits by central Illinois women artists; at the Peoria Art Guild is “In Good Company: Recent Work by Peoria Women Artists” and “Portrait of a Mother” by Joy Christiansen Erb; at the Contemporary Art Center is “Sculpture by Barbara Cooper” and the Fiber Artists Coalition’s “Got Jazz;” and work by members of the Prairie Fiber Guild is at the Peoria Public Library gallery in “Autumn on the Prairie.” “Not all the exhibits are connected to the Symposium, but they are all by women, so that’s why I’ve included it in our itinerary,” said Lyons. The two-day symposium happens at a couple locations on the Bradley University campus. It is free and open to the public, but advanced registration is required.

The paintings, drawings, prints and sculpture that Illinois women produced between 1940 and 1965 were for the most part subjective, imaginative, innovative and often political in subject matter. Not constrained by the critics and the demands of the East and West coast art markets, Illinois artists had “more freedom to create ‘personal’ rather than mainstream work,” said Chicago painter Suellen Rocca. It was a good time to be a woman artist, said painter Gladys Nilsson, especially in Chicago where women’s work was accepted, shown and rewarded for its quality and character rather than the gender of its maker.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T19:44:09.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
