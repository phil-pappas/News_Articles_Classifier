Posted: Thursday, October 15, 2015 11:15 pm Bread Basket program helps keep some students from going hungry By Louise Carroll For The Ledger EllwoodCityLedger.com | 1 comment \nELLWOOD CITY -- The Ellwood City Area School District Bread Basket program aims to ensure that 70 children identified as needing food are able to eat away from school. \nThe program helps fill gaps for schoolchildren who are eligible to receive free breakfast and lunch at school but might have no food available over the weekend. \nApril Thellman, guidance counselor for grades 10-12 at Lincoln High School, is Bread Basket coordinator. \n\"It is our goal to make sure that our children don't go hungry,\" Thellman said. \"We want them to have nutritious food because there are no other resources for them on weekends.\" \nEvery Friday, the identified children receive a bag of food. In the lower grades, teachers put the bags into the participating students' backpacks without other students knowing. \nThe food is kid-friendly and requires no cooking or heating. It includes applesauce, juice and milk, all packaged to be nonperishable. The food is packed and delivered by teacher Carol Kuper-Pyle's autism class at Lincoln High School. \n\"I have eight students this year, all boys,\" she said. \"It is a good exercise for them as they work together and make sure they have the right amount of each food in each bag. They like doing something to help people, and they enjoy going to all four schools to deliver the food.\" \nThe program started when Marcia Cater, from Wayne Township, heard about the program and took the idea to school board member Renee Pitrelli, who brought it to the school board's attention. \n\"The school board was enthusiastic about the program, and it is just overwhelming to see how many volunteers have stepped up,\" Pitrelli said. \nDonations are needed for the program, which started in spring 2014. This is hoped to be the program's first full year. \n\"We need help to fund this project, and we are hoping our community will respond,\" Thellman said. \"Feeding these 70 children for nine months will cost approximately $3,000, but if the need increases, they will require more funds.\" \nThe Bread Basket is an extension of the Feeding America BackPack Program.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:38:00.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
