It was brought under control about half an hour later, and the cause of the blaze is still under investigation, the FDNY said. The venue thinks an electrical malfunction may have caused it. \nDonations will first go toward helping the 14 displaced residents recover personal losses, such as basic clothing, bedding and health items. The tenants are all part of an artist-in-residence program run by Silent Barn. \nAdditional funds will help recover lost revenue from shows that were set to take place in October. The venue is looking for $30,000 in donations immediately to be able to open in the next couple weeks. \nAs of Monday, the venue had already raised about $17,000, Griffin said. \nSilent Barn, which is run largely by a network of 80 volunteers, opened less than two years ago and has hosted hundreds of shows since. \nAll the tenants upstairs were artists-in-residence at Silent Barn, and the venue is known for collaborating with community groups like rescue group A Tail of Two Kitties and youth dance group Educated Little Monsters . \nIn light of the trauma caused by the fire, people have been incredibly supportive of helping Silent Barn get back on its feet, Griffin said. \n\"All of our hearts are really broken right now because this is the thing we care about the most,\" she said. \"But we’re also so supported and really finally seeing that it’s OK.\" \nStay updated on where shows will move or any fundraising events on Silent Barn's Facebook page .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:47:59.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
