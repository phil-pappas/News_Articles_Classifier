Met at EW Fest on Saturday, October 24 in New York, he shared what to expect in the last episode. \"The killer is revealed and we spent a lot of time taking the audience through how the killer got away with what they got away with,\" he said, adding, \"So lots of flashbacks, lots of twists and turns.\" While stars Emma Roberts , Lea Michele and Keke Palmer have received the script for the last episode, Murphy said the girls didn't know the ending yet. \"What [the girls] neglected to tell you is that they got everything but the last act because I don't trust them. They're wily,\" he said. \"Scream Queens\" airs Tuesdays at 9/8c on FOX. While the network has not greenlit a second season yet, Murphy said that the idea for the possible season 2 had been approved. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T08:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T11:11:09.090+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
