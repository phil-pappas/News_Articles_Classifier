This healthy tissue traps cancer cells and blocks their movement away from the tumour.\nIn the study, the researchers, use mice, show that targeting fibroblasts reduces the movement of cancer cells from the tumour to the lungs and liver through the blood stream.\nLead author Janine Erler of the University of Copenhagen said these fibroblasts were present in all solid tumours, and added that their findings might be relevant to many different cancer types., adding that the therapy they tested was used to treat inflammatory diseases and could be used to treat cancer patients.\nThe study is published in the Journal EMBO Reports.\nFirst Published on October 01, 2015 5:20 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:19:37.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
