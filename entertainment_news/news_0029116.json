On Thursday, Noah attempted to speak from the heart, but couldn't find the words. \n\"This isn't a normal situation for me,\" Noah said of the shooting. \"I haven't had the time to feel, let alone think about everything that's happening.\" \nNoah added that all he could do at that moment was express his grief and do what he does best, which is \"try to make people laugh.\" \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource .
