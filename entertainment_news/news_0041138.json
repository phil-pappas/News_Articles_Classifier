(UPI) -- A semi truck driver braved flooding amid record rainfalls in South Carolina and was caught on camera driving through deep waters.\nThe video, posted to YouTube by user Charlton Mcleod, shows the semi truck submerged nearly to its windows on Highway 15 in Sumter as it is filmed from a car on the opposite side of the highway.\nA child in the car labels the driver \"big and bad\" for daring to drive through the deep water.\n\"If he makes it, I give him all the credit in the world,\" a woman's voice says.\nThe semi appears to make it out of the deep section of highway and drives away on comparatively dry land.\nCentral South Carolina is experiencing widespread flooding from record rainfalls.\nGov. Nikki Haley dubbed the precipitation a \"1,000-year level of rain.\"\nCopyright 2015 by United Press International Share Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1732935", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1732935&h=Semi+truck+caught+on+camera+crossing+South+Carolina+flood+waters", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1732935&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:35:28.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
