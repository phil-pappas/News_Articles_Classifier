I’m still discovering myself and in the competition, there are some amazing singers and I feel like I need more time to get better myself, as I don’t feel like I’m strong enough.” \nTom continued: “Moving forward, without being 100%, would have been selfish on my part because I would have stopped someone else who was at 100% vocally from going further in the competition. Hopefully given time, I could get there with more time to grow artistically and vocally.” \nThe young singer praised BBC Radio One’s Nick as a “fantastic” mentor, and thanked those who had backed him since his first audition back in August. \n“Nick was incredible, he was so supportive and for him to give me a chair was a huge boost of faith,” Tom said. “It was just an amazing feeling, but I was still having the doubts about myself and I didn’t want to be in the competition when I was having those doubts because I would have just sunk. Nick is a fantastic mentor and I really want to thank him for all his support.” \nReaction on Twitter has been swift. Many tweeters are backing the return of Ollie Marland, who lost his seat to finalist Che Chesterton during the Six Chair Challenge. Now that Tom Bleasby has left X factor, i honestly think Ollie Marland shoukd be brought back! He's better than Nathaniel tbh👀", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T23:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:44:43.331+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
