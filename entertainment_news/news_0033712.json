Bubba Ray and D-Von have wrestled in nearly every major organization and reigned supreme in each one. Whether fans embrace their antics or despise their vile malice, the Dudleys win no matter where they go. \nAs one-half of a legendary tag team that very well may be the best ever, Bubba Ray was still able to reinvent himself in TNA as the abrasive heel known simply as Bully Ray. The run earned him a world championship, and despite being synonymous with an iconic tag team, he is still bombarded with requests to resume a singles run in WWE. \nOn how The Dudley Boyz’ WWE return came about: \n“The process started way back in January of 2015. They contacted me and asked me if I wanted to be in the Royal Rumble and I told them “yes.” … \nI did the Royal Rumble and stayed in touch a little bit and decided that the RAW after SummerSlam would be the best time to come back and that’s really how the process started. There were one or two shows that they asked me to do by myself but I wasn’t able to do them. In retrospect, I think it was better than I wasn’t able to do them because it was a bigger shock when D-Von and me returned.” \n— Bubba Ray Dudley (@BubbaRayDudley) October 17, 2015 \nOn his secret to career longevity: \n“I really don’t even know. I just really try to take a lot better care of myself. I got myself in better shape about five years ago and just try to eat healthy and exercise more. There really is no secret. If you want your car to run forever you take care of it. You change the oil; you put good gasoline in it. If you want your body engine to run forever, you got to take care of it also.” \n“Old School Rules…New School Tools.” 407-390-9005 #SmackDown #DudleyBoyz #Team3DAcademy pic.twitter.com/P98lFSnQxn — Bubba Ray Dudley (@BubbaRayDudley) October 23, 2015 \nOn the upcoming Dudley Boyz DVD: \n“There are some really cool photos of me and D-Von in the past that you’re going to see and this will be the first true DVD about The Dudley Boyz, not just a “best of matches” or anything like that, you’re going to get me and D-Von doing separate sit down interviews, different settings and just getting a different perspectives on our careers. I think you’re going to get the DVD version of Motley Crue’s The Dirt. I think the fans are going to be really entertained by it.” \nWhat do you think of the chances of the Dudley Boyz winning the tag belts at Hell in a Cell? Sound off below. \nThe United States Champion joins forces with Bubba Ray & D-Von to clash with Xavier Woods, Big E & Kofi Kingston.
