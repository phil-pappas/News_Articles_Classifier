Two locations are in Baton Rouge. \nNewk’s features Southern-inspired soups, sandwiches, salads and pizzas for lunch and dinner, with an open kitchen and large, varied condiment table. \nThe new location will introduce a prototype look for future Newk’s that include neutral materials such as subway tile, pendant lighting, floor detail and plush upholstery, according to a press release. Floor plan changes are designed to add comfort to the in-store dining experience and expedite ordering and takeout. \nNewk’s is testing the new design concept in Lafayette and a second new restaurant in Cary, North Carolina, set to open late 2015. Guest and operator feedback will help determine the final design.
