The crew spent three years training wolves for the movie.\nChina Film News said it has been replaced by \"Go Away Mr. Tumor,\" a romantic comedy about an optimistic woman coping with cancer.\nThe last Chinese submission to be nominated for best foreign language film was Zhang Yimou 's 2002 film \"Hero.\"", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-11T11:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:01:47.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
