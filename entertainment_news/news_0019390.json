By Alex Osborn \nMore remakes from Square Enix appear to be on the horizon, as the publisher has announced plans to revisit its existing IPs and \"revitalize\" them for current-gen hardware. \n\"We will revitalize some of our strong IPs in ways that meet the needs of the modern gaming market,\" Square Enix said in its annual report (via Polygon ). \"For example, we will take an IP developed for earlier generations of game consoles and recreate it for the latest consoles, while also proactively developing versions for play on smart devices.\" Got feedback on our player? We want to hear it. \nThe company also cites VR and \"other new platforms\" as a way to breathe new life into its existing content. \"We want our longtime fans to relish reliving past experiences with a freshness that only the latest in technology can provide, while at the same time have new customers enjoy the IP as though it were brand new.\" \nEarlier this year, Square Enix announced plans to remake Final Fantasy VII for PlayStation 4. The game's director, Tetsuya Nomura, has also expressed an interest in remaking more titles from the Final Fantasy series , namely Final Fantasy V and VI. \nWhich classic Square Enix games would you like to see remade for current-gen consoles?
