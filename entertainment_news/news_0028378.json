One of the lead actresses, Kristen Wiig , admitted that she was not happy with the controversy, saying that it bummed her out. In an interview with LA Times to promote her new movie \" Nasty Baby \", Wiig was asked if she had ever starred in a movie that had received so much attention like her all-female \"Ghostbusters\" reboot. \"No,\" the 42-year-old actress stressed. \"And the fact there was so much controversy because we were women was surprising to me. Some people said some really not nice things about the fact that there were women,\" she added. \"It didn't make me mad, it just really bummed me out. We're really honoring those movies.\" Paul Feig, the director of the reboot, had similar experiences. Many Twitter users thought that an all-female cast is a gimmick, or in other words, women can't be funny. \"I just don't understand why it's ever an issue anymore. I've promoted both ' Bridesmaids ' and ' The Heat ' and myself and my cast are still hit constantly with the question, 'will this answer the question of whether women can be funny?' I really cannot believe we're still having this conversation,\" the director said of the backlash. Wiig stars alongside Melissa McCarthy , Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones, Chris Hemsworth and Neil Casey in the reboot that follows a group of female ghost hunters trying to prove the existence of the supernatural beings. The female-centric \"Ghostbusters\" reboot is scheduled for a U.S. release on July 15, 2016. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T10:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T11:10:51.766+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
