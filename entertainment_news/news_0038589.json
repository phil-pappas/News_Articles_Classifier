Fallon/Pool Photo via AP, File) \nLOS ANGELES (AP) — Marion “Suge” Knight is scheduled to return to court Tuesday morning for a hearing in which prosecutors will lay out some of their evidence to support a robbery case filed against the former rap music mogul. \nKnight’s lawyers have requested a delay in the hearing, but Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ronald Coen has previously told them he intends to proceed with the hearing. \nKnight is charged with robbery after a celebrity photographer accused him and comedian Katt Williams of taking her camera in Beverly Hills in September. The incident occurred days after the 50-year-old Knight was wounded in a nightclub shooting. \nThe Death Row Records co-founder is also charged in a separate murder case. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Williams has also pleaded not guilty.
