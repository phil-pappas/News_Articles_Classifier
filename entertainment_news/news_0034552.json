(Dash Coleman/Savannah Morning News)\nBack | Next Dash Coleman/Savannah Morning News\nKorean War veteran Frank Grady Jr. boards an Honor Flight Savannah tour bus bound for Washington, D.C., on Friday.\nBy Dash Coleman J ohn Phillips was flanked by saluting members of each U.S. military branch Friday morning as he walked across a faux red carpet toward a waiting charter bus at Hunter Army Airfield.\nSo were the other 22 veterans taking a free ride to Washington, D.C., to tour the national war monuments dedicated to their service and the lives lost in conflicts across the world.\n“It would never occur to me when I was coming up that something like this would happen,” said Phillips, a Korean War veteran who served as an airman in both the Army and the Air Force and recently moved here from Denver. “So many of us go through regular life and never get recognition for just being here, so this is mind boggling for me.”\nThe trips are something Honor Flight does regularly. The national nonprofit hauls veterans to see the monuments for free. Most of them fly, but the Savannah chapter takes a charter bus for a two-night trip.\n“When the veterans get there, the emotions — you can read it in their faces,” said Suzi Oliver, vice chairwoman of the Savannah chapter’s board.\n“Sometimes there are tears... When they get to these memorials and they’re with fellow veterans, the stories — sometimes you can see the pain in their eyes. It’s really incredible.”\nInitially, the organization only flew veterans of World War II and expanded to include veterans of the Korean War. The Savannah chapter has started to include Vietnam War veterans, three of whom left on the bus Friday morning. Each veteran is teamed up with a personal “guardian” — or chaperone, and nurses and a doctor accompany the group on trips.\nThe free trip’s only good once. But that doesn’t stop some repeat veterans.\nFrank Grady Jr. is one of them. The Sun City, S.C., veteran of the Korean War paid his own way Friday to serve as one of the guardians — he took the free trip in May.\n“You don’t know what to expect, and they just overwhelm you,” said Grady, 84.\nThe veterans had a mission, too.\nAfter some new Army recruits recited the oath of enlistment, the veterans were asked to stand.\nLt. Col. Michael Squires, the garrison commander at Hunter, told them to report to “active duty” for the purpose of taking the trip to Washington.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14833467.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14833469.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14833467.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14833470.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14833470.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14833469.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14833471.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14833471.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-23T18:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:10:52.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
