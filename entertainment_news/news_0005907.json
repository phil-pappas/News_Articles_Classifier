And at the same time, the Democrats held on to supermajority control of both legislative chambers.\nIn contested House races — ones in which both major parties fielded a candidate — the GOP won 51 percent to 49 percent. But in contested Senate races, the Democrats won 53 percent to 47 percent.\nTo sum up, a very divided electorate installed a very divided government.\nSince then, Rauner's hand has gotten weaker.\nHe began aggressively pursuing pro-business, anti-union elements of his \"turnaround agenda,\" and two months after his inauguration, an Ogden & Fry poll put his approval rating at 39.6 percent. By June 20, a little more than five months in, that rating had dropped to 35.7 percent.\nThe deadline for a new budget was July 1, but Rauner has refused to negotiate a compromise spending and tax plan with Democratic leaders unless they first agreed to curb collective bargaining rights for unionized public employees and eliminate a prevailing wage requirement on public construction jobs.\nNo, Gov. Edgar, 'doable' is the problem Editorial Board Before Bruce Rauner took office in January, an ex-governor who campaigned for him described the state's devastated finances. \"Doomsday's coming, we do not have a printing press,\" Jim Edgar told the Tribune. \"I was talking to some people to see if there's any smoke and mirrors left and I don't think...\nBefore Bruce Rauner took office in January, an ex-governor who campaigned for him described the state's devastated finances. \"Doomsday's coming, we do not have a printing press,\" Jim Edgar told the Tribune. \"I was talking to some people to see if there's any smoke and mirrors left and I don't think...\n(Editorial Board) The result has been a bitter standoff in which human service agencies are being squeezed and yet the state is still spending itself an estimated $16.4 million deeper in debt every single day.\nAn Ogden & Fry poll taken Oct. 10 found Rauner's approval rating had fallen to 32.3 percent, and that only 42 percent of respondents approved of curbing collective bargaining rights.\nThen last Friday, State Journal-Register political writer Bernard Schoenburg published an interview with former Republican Gov. Jim Edgar, a generally well-regarded moderate who campaigned for Rauner last year, in which Edgar said he thought Rauner should shelve his other demands for now and hammer out a budget with his (also unpopular) Democratic foes.\n\"You don't hold the budget hostage to get\" nonbudget reforms, Edgar said. The protracted stalemate \"has been very destabilizing for state government,\" he said. And \"an unstable state government … is a detriment to economic growth.\"\nWant to fix Illinois state government? Look to the Cubs Brian Brady The Chicago Cubs' improbable run is bringing hope and joy to a fan base that had grown cynical and hopeless about ever winning a World Series. Now, it seems likely that this team of great young players has a credible chance to win a world championship this year or in the near future.

Now, it seems likely that this team of great young players has a credible chance to win a world championship this year or in the near future. The cynicism...\n(Brian Brady) He added, \"It's a complete mess-up, what's going on, and I think we need to end it.\"\nThat same day, when reporters asked Republican Comptroller Leslie Munger for her view of the anti-union portion of Rauner's agenda, she said, \"I don't think it's productive. I think we've got to work together ... to solve the problems in Illinois.\"\nMonday, again speaking to reporters, Munger clarified that she supports changes in workers' compensation and tort law as well as a property-tax freeze but thinks those can be done in \"ways that don't impact unions at all.\"\nAlso Monday, the United Way of Metropolitan Chicago released the results of a survey of more than 500 human service agencies that serve state residents. It showed that 84 percent have had to cut the number of clients they serve, 79 percent have cut programs and 22 percent have laid off staff — a summary that doesn't come as any surprise to those of us whose email inboxes are peppered daily with messages of alarm from those who represented poor children, the elderly and the disabled.\n\"I'm not picking sides or casting any blame,\" said AT&T of Illinois President Paul La Schiazza in a related news release. \"However, to help people and families in need — and the human service agencies that are struggling to support them — Illinois needs a state budget resolution soon.\"\nRauner has yet to \"prepare and submit\" a balanced budget proposal, as the state constitution requires. The budget outline he released back in February relied on $2.2 billion in future savings from a change in pension law that would require a constitutional amendment to enact, and on $3.6 billion in spending cuts that Democrats contend would violate the law or existing contracts.\nInstead Rauner has harped on the Democrats for submitting appropriations requests totaling some $3 billion to $4 billion more than anticipated revenue and for refusing to use their supermajority to try to pass tax increases to pay for the spending they want.\nJust meeting in the middle on the spending dispute was always going to be hard enough without the paralyzing complication of Rauner's attacks on unions.\nTo preserve any chance of winning, in the future, he needs to throw in now, not double down on what's looking more and more like a losing hand.\nPut forth a realistic budget, make the Democrats do the same and hammer out the differences. Live to play another hand.\nYou can buy and promise your way into office, but you have to earn a reputation for leadership — the ace card in any political deck.\nComments: www.chicagotribune.com/zorn\nTwitter @ Eric Zorn\n Bruce Rauner Job Layoffs Jobs and Workplace Unemployment and Layoffs Democratic Party Republican Party Leslie Munger", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5626af67/turbine/ct-rauner-budget-illinois-edgar-madigan-zorn-perspec-1021-20151020", "http://www.twitter.com/ericzorn", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56256ad3/turbine/ct-jim-edgar-bruce-rauner-illinois-budget-edit-20151019", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5626b354/turbine/ct-llinois-cubs-theo-epstein-rauner-madigan-1021-jm-20151021"], "published": "2015-10-21T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:16:38.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
