In addition, she has conducted interviews with political and military figures, political dissidents and victims of all types of persecution.\nLast year, Daftari brought the case of Raif Badawi —a Saudi blogger flogged for his beliefs—to mainstream media attention, and in 2012, she broke the story of Saeed Abedini , an Iranian pastor from Idaho arrested in Iran for his Christian faith.\n“The Foreign Desk will have the stories you don’t see anywhere else,” Daftari said.\n“These are exclusive stories that go beyond the traditional headlines with comprehensive analysis and contextualization. Basically, this will be a site that breaks down the issues in a way that’s easy to understand and relevant for all,” she said.\nFor those who want a quick daily dose of foreign affairs, The Foreign Desk readers can subscribe to a daily email roundup of the most important stories focusing on U.S. national security, foreign policy and human rights.\nDaftari is also in the process of sitting down with many of the U.S. 2016 election frontrunners to hear their take on issues such as foreign policy and national security.\n“These are non-partisan issues,” according to Daftari. “We are living in a time when foreign policy has become a critical focus, which is why this is the perfect time for a website like The Foreign Desk to enter the news circuit, shedding light on important developments around the world while concentrating on the issues that concern all Americans—national security and U.S. diplomacy.”\nAbout Lisa Daftari\nLisa Daftari is an award-winning investigative journalist focusing on foreign affairs with expertise in the Middle East and counterterrorism.
