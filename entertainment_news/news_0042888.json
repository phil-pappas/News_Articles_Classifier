Ant and Dec will be back to host the show, which will return to screens in 2016. No, but Simon really is more excited than he looks (Ian West/PA) \nSimon said: “I can’t believe that in 2016 we are going to celebrate 10 series of Britain’s Got Talent. So, let’s make this a special year and we want the best of the best to come and audition. There will be lots of surprises in store.” \nFunnyman David added: ”I’m so happy to be back with Simon and the girls, especially as we look for our 10th winner. I’m hoping to find something extraordinary.” \nThe current judging panel has remained the same for the past four years, since Alesha and David joined in the sixth series in 2012. This will be David Walliams’s fifth series (Daniel Leal-Olivas/PA) \nOpen auditions for the latest series begin on October 25, taking place in Birmingham, Cardiff, Liverpool, London, Glasgow and Manchester to find the next winner. \nAmanda said she “cannot wait” to see what the public have in store, “and what act will surprise me the most”, and Alesha added: ”It’s always exciting to see who or what is going to turn up on stage as there are so many amazing and unusual talents, but to find our 10th winner adds another level of pressure. \n“We’ve had brilliant winners over the years and I hope we can find another incredible act that can really rise to the occasion. We have reached a milestone.” We reckon these guys get on pretty well (Ian West/PA) \nDog act Jules and Matisse were crowned champions of this year’s series, following Ashleigh and Pudsey in 2012. \nOther past acts include singers Susan Boyle and Paul Potts, dance troupes Diversity and Spelbound, and shadow theatre outfit Attraction.
