Previous Next Enlarge Long before the Kardashians became the reigning family of reality TV, there was Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag — otherwise known as \"Speidi.\"\nThe couple, who starred on \"The Hills\" and \"Marriage Boot Camp,\" may have dropped from reality ratings, but they've come back to the spotlight long enough to throw shade at Kim Kardashian and former “Hills” co-star Lauren Conrad.\nPratt, 32, recently revealed to Complex magazine that Kardashian may have \"broke the Internet\" but back in his heyday she organized Montag's closet. Because of his success on “The Hills,\" momager Kris Jenner once asked if he would manage Kim. \"I literally starting laughing,\" he said. \"What is this lady talking about?\"\nKim's rep denies the conversation took place, according to the magazine.\nPratt and Montag, who married in 2009, were known as the villainous couple on the MTV reality show. They both enjoyed spreading gossip and belittling their co-stars.\nJason Squires Former friends Heidi Montag and Lauren Conrad once starred on \"The Hills.\" He insists it was Conrad who was the mean one. “Lauren is a cold-hearted killer. That's what people don't get. She will cut you in your sleep,\" he said. \"She tried to destroy us. If you want to throw missiles, I'm throwing a nuke. This is how I operate.\"\nThe couple's friendship with Conrad ended in 2008 after she blamed Montag for spreading rumors that she and then-beau Jason Wahler had a sex tape. At the time Conrad, who now designs clothes for Kohl's, insisted the tape doesn't exist.\nBut the feud goes deeper than that. He said his former co-star is the reason he doesn't speak to his family.\n“My mom's a Lauren supporter,\" he said. Adding that even Montag's mother and sister were \"paid off\" to be \"Team LC.\"\nmhood@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories Stephanie Pratt: I smoked crystal meth up to 13 times a day Heidi Montag's dad accused of incest with teen: cops Brody Jenner: I 'never' dated Lauren Conrad.
