Toll again demonstrates his mastery at depicting World War II naval, air and land combat in the Pacific.\nThe Conquering Tide is heavily researched and spans nearly 600 pages. Yet Toll’s absorbing text flows smoothly and quickly, helped along by anecdotes and stories involving combatants and political leaders on both sides, plus coast watchers who spied on the Japanese from mountaintops and jungles and risked their lives to radio attack warnings.\nToll’s well-regarded first book in the trilogy, Pacific Crucible , covers the Pacific War’s early stages, from Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor to the Battle of Midway six months later, a major American victory. The Conquering Tide focuses on the grim battles to retake key islands, from Guadalcanal to Guam.\nA known but still-disturbing trend appears repeatedly in this new book. Countless thousands of soldiers, sailors, Marines and airmen, Allied and Japanese, died as a result of interservice rivalries, as well as decisions driven by the egos, jealousies or intractable beliefs of top admirals, generals and national leaders.\n“The Pacific War was the largest, bloodiest, most costly, most technically innovative, and most logistically complex amphibious war in history,” Toll explains. “To roll back the tide of Japanese conquests, the Allies would be required to seize one island after another, advancing across thousands of miles of ocean in two huge parallel offenses on either side of the equator.” He emphasizes: “The Army, Navy and Marines were compelled to work together in sustained and intricate cooperation. They would make many mistakes and do their best to learn from them. But even when their operations were successful, the\ninterservice feuding left scars that even victory could not heal.”\nMany top Japanese military leaders, meanwhile, clung stubbornly to a “single-minded fixation on the all-important ‘decisive fleet battle’ — a concept that dominated Japanese naval planning and strategic thinking before and during the war,” Toll notes. “This climactic clash of fleets was to occur somewhere in the western Pacific. It would involve substantially all of the capital ships in both the American and the Japanese navy. It would occur (it was hoped) in tactical circumstances favoring the Japanese. It might begin with punishing land- and carrier-based air attacks on the American fleet, perhaps while the Americans were tied down in support of some major amphibious operation. But the big guns of the Japanese battleships would deliver the coup de grace .”\nBut there were key flaws in the “decisive fleet battle” strategy, Toll explains. Japanese army garrisons on Pacific islands sometimes were left to fend for themselves. And many Japanese supply convoys and troop ships received only token naval protection and air cover, while Japanese battleships, aircraft carriers and support vessels were moved about in hopes of drawing the Allies into the titanic clash of fleets.\nThe Japanese had prepared brilliantly for war in the Pacific, at least with their aircraft and large warships. Their fighters and medium bombers usually could fly faster and farther and outmaneuver America’s early World War II aircraft, Toll points out. “Before December 1941, American and British aviation experts had arrogantly insisted that Japanese airplanes were poorly engineered knockoffs of Western technology, and Japanese pilots were laughably inept crash-test dummies.” Only after Allied air power was wiped out in the opening weeks of war did they realized they had been duped. “Playing cleverly on the hubris and racial chauvinism of their Western rivals, the Japanese had disguised the formidable power of their air fleets and airmen.”\nAt the same time, however, the Japanese never developed “more than rudimentary capabilities in antisubmarine warfare,” Toll explains. “The samurai warrior culture esteemed offensive warfare more than defensive considerations, and no ambitious officer would waste his time specializing in the dreary and unglamorous business” of protecting merchant vessels carrying troops or food, fuel or other supplies. This helped bring about the collapse of their far-flung empire.\nFor anyone seeking better understanding of how World War II combat unfolded in the vastness of the Pacific Ocean, this book is an outstanding guide.\nAustin writer and reviewer Si Dunn served in the U.S. Pacific Fleet aboard a World War II-era destroyer during the early part of the Vietnam War.\nThe Conquering Tide: War in the Pacific Islands, 1942-1944 Ian W.
