The film Visaranai, based on his book, Lock Up, became the first Tamil film to win the Cinema for Human Rights award at the Venice Film Festival, and Auto Chandran, along with director Vetri Maaran, and actor Samuthirakani and Dinesh, was in Venice for the film's screening.\nThe 53-year-old auto driver recalls, \"The Venice trip was totally unexpected, but I knew that the film would be going places. When it made it to the shortlist at the Venice Film Festival, Vetri Maaran had called me up and asked me to keep my passport ready. I had to go for a family wedding to Mumbai around the same time as the festival, but I was so confident that I booked only my return ticket from Mumbai. I was then told that there'd a dress code at the event and a coat was mandatory. When I finally bought a coat after a two-day shopping stint, and sent the picture to my daughter studying in the UK, she said it was a coat worn during weddings, not a suit-coat. I had to finally borrow another one from my friend,\" says Chandran.\nHe says that he had the time of his life at Venice. \"It's small city that hardly spans a few kilometres. As soon as we reached there, we rented cycles and pedalled across the entire city. In fact, when the other movie crews were arriving in their luxury cars at the venue of the film fest, we rode our bicycles.\"\nThe book Lock Up, published in 2006, chronicles Chandran's first-hand experience of police brutality, when he was jailed as a young man when working in Guntur. Chandran, along with his friends were arrested and tortured for 13 days for a crime they didn't commit, before they were allowed to go. \"I narrated my experience to my friend Thangavelan. It was he who asked to pen down my experiences.\"\nWhen Visaranai was being shot, the Class X dropout spent a few days on the set, especially during the Guntur schedule. \"After Vetri Maaran decided to make a movie based on my book, we spent some time discussing films. Interestingly, we never discussed Visaranai during those meetings. But when they finally began canning the police brutality scenes in Guntur, I was overwhelmed. I took him to every street in Guntur, dined at the same place where I used to eat along with my friends when I was living there and walked around every lane. Vetri Maaran would accompany me everywhere. Dinesh, too, was quite shocked that I had to face so much brutality for a crime I didn't commit.\"\nSo, what does he think of the cops now? \"The police are not the only ones to be blamed. We have to stop glorifying encounters on screen. Police enquiries have to be done in a fair manner and for that, we have to make some changes in the Constitution itself,\" says Chandran, who is now penning two novels, Alagu Thodattuma and Veppamatra Velloliyil, both of which, he says, will also be talked about.\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-09-25T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:43:00.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
