In a Toyota commercial, fiction meets reality.\nAnd Toyota is taking advantage of the opportunity. Fans of the show might remember that McFly's dream car in 1985 was a Toyota truck.\nActors Christopher Lloyd and Michael J. Fox sat at a diner table to discuss what was predicted in the past about 2015. Flat screen televisions, 3D movies, drones and video conferencing are all part of life in 2015 that the movie predicted. But the film also predicted hoverboards, self-lacing shoes, flying cars and food hydrators as well.\nAnd of course fax machines. Yes, fax machines exist, but they are not as widespread as suggested by the movie.\nThe Toyota suggested that a full film would be released on Oct. 21. Perhaps it might be a tie-in for an announcement byToyota.\n“Over the years, we’ve had a lot of fun predicting which \" Back to the Future\" fictional 2015 technology would arrive by the real year,” Fox said in a statement. “Now that we’re a week away, I think fans are going to have a good time with what Toyota sees as a true possibility for transportation. It’s actually really cool.”\nIn a press release from Toyota, Fox will help the car company unveil a new vehicle next week.\nMore News From Our News Partners Father learns to walk again so he can take daughter down the aisle on her wedding day Koko the gorilla receives kittens for 44th birthday Man gets 5 years for showercam, says it was for watching chickens Man crushed by 16-pound pine cone sues park for $5 million Mark Hamill denies flubbing Star Wars lines", "external_links": ["http://host.coxmediagroup.com/cop/digital/sites/common/js/cmgo_right_rail_addons.js\\", "http://www.wpxi.com/news/news/national/man-crushed-16-pound-pinecone-sues-park-5-million/nn3xj/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVebChGtLlY", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/908/img/photos/2015/08/09/e1/fe/PLG\\u002D10\\u002DPREDICTIONS\\u002DBACK\\u002DTO\\u002DFUTURE\\u002DNDCROPPED.jpg", "http://www.myajc.com/photo/technology/10\\u002Dthings\\u002Dback\\u002Dto\\u002Dthe\\u002Dfuture\\u002Dii\\u002Dpredicted\\u002Dwed\\u002Dhave/pCm4Hp/?icmp\\u003Ddaytondaily_internallink_referralbox_free\\u002Dto\\u002Dpremium\\u002Dreferral", "http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js", "http://www.krmg.com/news/news/national/man-gets-5-years-showercam-says-it-was-watching-ch/nn3wy/", "http://www.kirotv.com/news/news/national/father-learns-walk-again-so-he-can-take-daughter-d/nn394/", "http://www.wftv.com/news/entertainment/movies/did-he-or-didnt-he-mark-hamill-denies-flubbing-sta/nn322/", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:14:50.606+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
