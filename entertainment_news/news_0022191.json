Those with with a “premium plus” ticket can eat and imbibe with waiter service. Those “premium” seats are also a bit more comfy — they’re full-leg reclining chairs, complete with pillows and blankets. \nPrices will range from about $14 to $28 for seating, while food and drinks will be extra. \nSome food planned for in-theater dining includes bites like empanadas ($14), a variety of personal pizzas and sandwiches, as well as popcorn, fries and an artisanal cheese plate. \nThe theater will also have a separate, dine-in restaurant, tentatively called the Tuck Room and helmed by James Beard Award-winning chef Sherry Yard. The varied menu includes everything from sushi and oysters, to buttermilk fried chicken ($14) and filet mignon ($32). \nAt a recent CB1 Financial District Committee meeting, Safran won support for iPic’s liquor license, though there were some concerns. \nSome CB members voiced worries about keeping the drinks out of underage hands — Safran said the chain was “very strict” when it comes to enforcing drinking restrictions. He also said the theater, with its pricier seating, wasn't really a favorite of teens, and \"catered to an older crowd.\" \nSome members asked whether there would be security, considering potential for rowdiness with drinking, while children might be watching a movie in a different theater. Safran said that while there wasn't security specifically, staff and general managers are \"trained to handle situations.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:29:39.251+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
