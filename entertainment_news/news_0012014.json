Pic/Santa Banta \nAccording to a source, both Kidman and her former husband Tom Cruise were asked to stay away when Isabella Cruise married British IT consultant Max Parker at London's Dorchester Hotel on September 18. But they weren't upset by the snub and had a private celebration with the couple instead, reports mirror.co.uk.\n\"Tom picked up the bill and paid for everything, but it was decided that neither he nor Nicole should attend as it would have turned the whole event into a circus,\" the source said.\n\"Nicole was actually involved with the wedding preparations and she did have a private dinner with Bella and Max. But she didn't go to the ceremony. Also, the animosity between Tom and Nicole was probably a factor,\" the source added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:58:53.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
