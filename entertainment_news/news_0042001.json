Comment By Dana BarbutoThe Patriot Ledger Posted Sep. 30, 2015 at 3:47 pm Updated at 5:15 PM “The Martian” is everything the over-hyped space-opera “Interstellar” wasn’t: fun, hip, affecting, thrilling. It’s kismet that Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain play astronauts in both. But that’s where the similarities end. Rather than just presenting the audience with a special-effects show, the filmmakers have made a dedicated effort to explore the dilemmas that might result from an astronaut actually being stranded on Mars. In “The Martian,” an Oscar-worthy Damon does the space cowboy thing as Mark Watney, an ace astronaut left for dead on Mars after a sudden and ferocious storm forces his crewmates (Chastain, Michael Peña, Kate Mara, Aksel Hennie and Sebastian Stan) to hurriedly flee the planet. Using limited supplies, Watney must scratch to find a way to survive on a planet where air is thin and plants won’t grow. Lucky for him, Watney’s a botanist. But there’s more, Watney also has the added task of somehow making contact with Earth in hopes of being rescued. Resolving not to surrender to death, Watney goes all MacGyver to “science the sh**” out of what little he has left to work with. Donna Summer’s “Hot Stuff,” Gloria Estefan’s “Turn the Beat Around” and other disco hits boost his morale, even though he’s clearly not a fan. But he’ll take any connection to civilization he can get. Even Fonzie! Damon gives the scenes energy enriched with humor and pathos, as he records a video blog in which he reveals his every thought, a device that cleverly allows him to be his own narrator. His monologues are riveting, as we watch Watney draw on his resourcefulness to persevere through every obstacle nature tosses his way. Food supply dwindling? No problem. Watney figures out a way to grow organic potatoes. As the movie’s inventive director, Ridley Scott is firmly in his element. It’s his best work in years, harkening back to his “Alien” and “Blade Runner” days when he was on the cutting edge of the mainstream filmmaking. Scott is very much at home here with material that is both intellectual and sentimental. Tension, urgency, humor and, mostly, humanity, abound. Watney’s survival story isn’t the only one taking shape. In adapting Andy Weir’s best-seller, Scott and screenwriter Drew Goddard (“World War Z”) fluidly oscillate between what’s happening on Mars, and what’s transpiring 140 million miles away back at NASA headquarters in Houston and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. We even periodically check in on Watney’s crewmates aboard the mothership, Hermes, as it races home to Earth. Damon on the Red Planet is the main event, but Scott doesn’t short-shrift his supporting characters. The ensemble is outstanding. Funnygal Kristen Wiig does drama as NASA’s director of media relations, going toe-to-toe with NASA chief Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels), who makes impossible demands in an effort to rescue Watney. “Mark dies if you don’t,” he grimly tells his team. Chiwetel Ejiofor (“12 Years a Slave”) is Dr. Vincent Kapoor, head of NASA’s Mars project and Watney’s main hope for survival. Kapoor spends much of the film communicating electronically with Watney and tracking him on a giant computer screen. Kapoor infuses the film with much urgency, as he races against time to figure out how to save Watney before the castaway’s food and water disappear. Donald Glover and Mackenzie Davis are terrific as young NASA employees. Though the movie is star-studded, the one that shines brightest is Damon, bringing sexy back to science. He’s (wait for it ... ) my favorite Martian.
