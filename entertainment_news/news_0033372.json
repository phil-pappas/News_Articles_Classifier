But the boys beat the girls by getting more items and escaping harsh fines. After project manager Vana brought no-nonsense Elle and \"dead weight\" Jenny into the boardroom, Jenny was fired, while Vana and Elle were let off, with some words of warning. 9.57 \nElle tells the group, \"If you make mistakes you need to stand by those mistakes,\" minutes after Lord Sugar told Vana not to be too quick to take responsibility for things. Is this a strategy?? 9.55 \nJenny is fired! I'm actually shocked. I hate to see candidates leave the process before they've had a chance to truly embarrass themselves on screen. \nApprentice 2015, episode 3: Jenny is fired 9.54 \nWell, Vana's plan not to let things get too catty went well, didn't it? The final three \nThe Apprentice 2015, episode3: Elle, Vana and Jenny in the boardroom \nAs project manager, Vana is automatically back in the boardoom. She chooses to bring Elle back with her, \"as she was the sub team leader\". Feel free to prove me wrong, but isn't the argument that leaders are accountable for their team's decisions a risky strategy to take as the PM of the losing team? Even more controversially, Vana also brings back Jenny, who, aside from being a bit in the background, has made no mistakes so far. 9.50 \n\"Vana, I don't know why you're laughing. It was a tale of woe,\" says Karren. Vana instantly puts on her best woe face. \nApprentice 2015: Vana's face of woe.

Photo: BBC 9.45 \n\"It smells like winning, and success.\" God, the boys really are unbearable when they win, aren't they? \nTeam Versatile drink to their success The results \nThe boys win with a total spend of £409.21 to the girls' £725.90. Ouch. The high cost of the boat and the missing items cost the girls dearly. The boys run off to enjoy a fancy wine tasting, while the girls are stuck at Bridge Cafe. 9.38 \nRichard not too impressed with Joseph's maths skills. 15 minus 14.80 is not quite 0.30, babe. The boardroom \nThat's it! It's boardroom time. To recap: the girls failed to find two items, and took a risk on their 1/2 piece of cheese and £250 boat. The boys failed to find one item, while their riskiest item is their £10 toy boat. The general pattern is that, boats aside, the girls have undercut the boys on almost everything. 9.32 \n\"I could easily play safe but this game's not about playing safe,\" says Gary, buying a toy boat instead of a real one. Remember how that paper skeleton went down last year, Gary? 9.28 \nThis is not Karren's \"impressed face\". \nApprentice 2015: Karren is unimpressed. Photo: BBC 9.25 \nMergim says the privilege of meeting him should be payment enough. The seller increases the price. \nMergim talking to a shop owner this week \nI take it all back, go back to the window shopping idea!! \nMeanwhile, the girls are discovering that heels were not the best choice of footwear this week as they sink slowly into an enormous pile of manure. \nElle, Charleine, Jenny and Ruth in 'The Apprentice' 9.22 \nI'm not sure window shopping is the best tactic for this task. \nApprentice 2015: How much is that antique in the window? Photo: BBC 9.16 \nThere is some confusion in the girls' team over whether they need a whole wheel of cheese or just a piece. \"When you think about it, any cheese could be a whole piece,\" says Vana. I can hear that argument going down a treat in the boardroom. 9.15 \nThe Apprentice is a load of s*** nowadays, eh? \nApprentice 2015: The boys get their hands dirty. Photo: BBC 9.14 \nHere's the list of things the candidates need to find: \n1. Manure (30 kilos) \n2. Leavers lace (2 meters) \n3. Cheese (one whole Maroilles variety) \n4. A Louis Phillipe mirror (rectangular and framed in wood) \n5. Mussels (10 kilos) \n6. Inflatable boat (minimum 1.5 meters) \n7. Snails (100) \n8. Anchor (four prong, 4 kilo galvanised anchor) \n9. Champagne flutes (7, cut crystal) 9.12 \nFluent french-speaker Claude is cringing at the boys' efforts. 9.10 \nHis task hasn't even begun and already Joseph is The Worst. 9.09 \n\"I'm going to need this to be well managed,\" demands Vana, the project manager. 9.07 \nVana leads the girls in Team Connectus. Joseph Valente leads the boys, aka Versatile. The challenge \nAfter bringing the candidates to Dover, Lord Sugar informs them that the task this week is a familiar favourite: the scavenger hunt. The candidates must hunt down a list of nine specific items, and bag them all for the lowest possible price. Any items not found will incur a £50 fine, on top of the average cost of the item. But there's a twist: while the teams remain boys versus girls, each team is split in two. One half of each team will go to Calais to hunt for half the items, while the other sub-teams will track the rest down in Kent. There's a strict time limit on this task: late arrivals will be penalised, so don't miss that ferry, teams! 9.04 \n\"You're in the secret wartime tunnels beneath Dover Castle, from where the mission to evacuate Dunkirk was launched during the Second World War. For this task, I'm sending you on your own mission. Now, if you want to be my business partner, I expect you to be able to negotiate any time, anywhere, and most importantly, with anyone. So I'm sending you...\" To WAR, Alan?? Bit extreme. 9.03 \nAh, Richard. Such a team guy, y'know? Loves to just: get involved! In the team. Ahem. \nApprentice 2015: The boys playing video games in the house. Photo: BBC \nApprentice 2015: Richard reads, sad and alone. Photo: BBC 8.55 \nHere we go! The Apprentice is on in five. To recap: this week is the scavenger hunt task, where the candidates must find nine items for the cheapest possible price. It's boys v girls, and half the teams are in France! Bon voyage, everybody... BONJOUR \nI'm Anna and I will be liveblogging tonight's Apprentice from now until late! We'll be giving you minute-by-minute updates on the boardroom and beyond. Feel free to drop me your questions, observations and hilarious insights on twitter: @annaleszkie . Last Week \nIn last week's cactus-infused episode, we said goodbye to self-starter and hair product whiz Aisha. (We hardly knew ye!) But the competition grinds on, and the candidates that emerged squeaky clean from the shampoo task are ready for another round. Tonight's task \nTonight, the candidates are surprised by an afternoon call from Lord Sugar with the foreboding instructions to \"pack an overnight bag.\" He assembles his troops at the secret wartime tunnels beneath Dover castle, where he informs the candidates that this week's task is the tried and tested scavenger hunt. The candidates must hunt down a list of specific items, and the team that secures them for the lowest price will win. The teams \nThe teams remain boys versus girls, but there's a subteam split this week as half of each team are sent across the channel to negotiate for their items in French. Expect more \"por favor\"s than \"s'il vous plaît\"s and several exasperated looks from fluent francophone Claude Littner . \nThe scavenger hunt task is a formidable one: it comes with a strict time limit and harsh fines for any missing items. It's also a task that requires a high level of strategy and organisation. Let's see how the candidates cope. Francophone \nThis week, we learn that Claude Littner is a fluent french speaker. Something to add to his already impressive CV, then... \nKarren despairs \nLord Sugar's getting us in the mood for tonight's episode with this, erm, enticing trailer. Oh dear. We're off to France for tonight's @bbcapprentice and as you can see, https://t.co/ZXsB1LHpfk , some of the candidates get into deep s***. — Lord Sugar (@Lord_Sugar) October 21, 2015 \nAs Karren has her head in her hands this week, let's remind ourselves why the candidates should be worried.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T23:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:13:13.358+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
