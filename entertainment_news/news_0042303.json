Bassist Phil Lesh is not involved, although Weir in an earlier interview did not rule out the possibility of Lesh joining an upcoming show.\nThe Grateful Dead celebrated its 50th anniversary with five concerts in June and July, two decades after beloved guitarist Jerry Garcia died of a heart attack and long after releasing its last studio album.\nStill, younger fans continue to discover the jam band known for its live sessions and improvisation, including 37-year-old Mayer, who said he fell hard and fast for the music in 2011. He met Weir while guest-hosting the \"The Late Late Show\" in February and from there, the idea of collaborating evolved.\nWeir said Tuesday that when they played together, he noticed Mayer \"was answering back, and it was fun, and more fun than I was really going to be happy about just walking away from.\"\nThe band announced Monday that 5,000 fans will have a chance to win two tickets each to a Nov. 7 show at Madison Square Garden in New York City.\nRelated Stories Grateful Dead members give out free tickets after huge reunion", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T04:34:56.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
