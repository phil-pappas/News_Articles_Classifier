And it's the same in the opposite direction. If charted, I-55 would look like a bell curve.\nI grew up right in the middle of that — a few miles east in Mattoon, on I-57, itself a Cubs-Cardinals north-south matrix — and while we were probably 65 percent Cardinals fans down there, there were enough Cubs fans to make every Cardinals-Cubs game feel a bit like a casual Civil War. In Champaign, where I went to college, the campus bars all show Cubs games, but all it takes is a 10-minute walk down Green Street to the Tumble Inn on Neil, and you're at a Cardinals bar. This makes the Cardinals-Cubs rivalry uniquely powerful and also uniquely cordial. Most rivalries are provincial.\nYankees fans hate the Red Sox not just because they're the Red Sox but because they're from Boston; Northern California is something fundamentally different than Southern California; every part of Texas thinks it's the only part of Texas, and so on. But down that I-55 corridor, people co-exist in every other way than their baseball team perfectly fine. It is woven into day-to-day life, a signature identifying characteristic you carry around with you.\nGrowing up in Mattoon, you either loved Willie McGee and Ozzie Smith and John Tudor, as I did, or you loved Ryne Sandberg and Jody Davis and Leon Durham. Neither was in your control, in the same way your eye color or your asthma was not in your control. They were just part of who you were, and we all accepted it. Your fandom is like disagreeing with a family member about politics; you know they're wrong, but you love them anyway. You just hope it doesn't come up at Thanksgiving dinner.\nUntil now — right now — this conflict has been mostly theoretical. Sure, the Cardinals and Cubs play each other 19 games a year, and these are intense psychological ordeals whether they're at Busch Stadium or Wrigley Field. But they're still generally welcoming; you see a ton of Cardinals jerseys at Wrigley and a ton of Cubs jerseys at Busch, and it's fine because it speaks to the power and breadth and devotion of each of these deep fan bases of two of baseball's platinum franchises. Everyone understands: There are Cardinals fans everywhere and Cubs fans everywhere, and we've all learned to live with each other.\nBut you can't help but wonder if this is just because the stakes have been so low. The Cardinals and Cubs, even though they're in the same division in the same league, always seem to be occupying different universes. It's not just because the Cardinals have had more success than the Cubs. Since 1996, the Cardinals have missed the postseason only seven times: 1997, 1998, 1999, 2003, 2007, 2008 and 2010. Before this year, the Cubs had made the postseason four times since 1996, and every one of them was during a season the Cardinals missed: 1998, 2003, 2007 and 2008. It is as if they were purposely trying to avoid each other.\nThe Cubs' postseason pain doesn't involve the Cardinals, and the Cardinals' postseason glory has nothing to do with the Cubs at all. The teams have never met in a postseason series. This has made the rivalry fierce but also relatively bloodless. The battles have never taken place when they mattered fundamentally, at a molecular level. Neither team has ever cost the other anything.\nThat changes Friday night. Starting then, not everyone is going to be so friendly. We've already noticed a difference in the rivalry this year. Cubs manager Joe Maddon, who grew up a Cardinals fan, has made a point to try to put a pinprick in the Cardinals' mystique, mocking \"The Cardinals Way\" and comparing them, post-beanball brawl, to Tony Soprano. This is strategic of course; the Cubs hit batters and get hit just like everybody else, and Maddon knows that. But he's trying to pick a fight. He's saying that playtime is over. And he is absolutely right.\nImagine if David Freese's 2011 homer had happened against the Cubs? Or the Bartman play, poor doomed Bartman, imagine if that had happened against the Cardinals rather than the Marlins? Parts of Coles County would still be on fire. And now that's about to happen. This series has taken a rivalry that's ingrained into the very fabric of the Midwest, and it has weaponized it. It's a profound shift in the rivalry, and I bet it's irreversible.\nAll those small towns, not just off I-55 and I-57 but throughout the Midwest, their friendly, cuddly little hey-you-like-the-Cards-that's-great-I-like-the-Cubs-good-luck! cheerfulness is about to evaporate. The Cardinals are trying to ascend again to the heights to which they have become accustomed to believe they belong, and the last thing their fans want to believe is that the Cubs — the Cubs — are going to be the team to keep them from it. And the Cubs, simply, are trying to make history and change the world.\nNo one knows what's going to happen in this series: Predicting something this combustible is a fool's errand. But one thing is certain: It would be wise for Cardinals fans to watch this series with Cardinals fans, and Cubs fans to watch this series with Cubs fans, and ne'er the twain shall meet. This is serious business. This is for everything. It's all going to be different after this.\nWill Leitch is a senior writer for Sports on Earth, culture writer for Bloomberg Politics, a contributing editor at New York Magazine and the founder of Deadspin.
