Chopra was the 2000 Miss World winner. \nThe error was noted online by viewers, and ABC responded with an apology and posted a corrected version of the \"Nightline\" story online. \nChopra, a Bollywood star who plays an FBI recruit in \"Quantico,\" responded to the mix-up on Twitter by posting \"LOL\" and linking to another post that read, \"Uh oh, @Nightline!\" Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
