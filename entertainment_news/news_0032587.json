Her very first post was accompanied by a black and white headshot of the London-born star. \nAdele has also confirmed Hello as the debut single from 25. It will be available to buy and stream on Friday October 23, with the cinematic video for the track released on the same day. \nShot in the countryside surrounding Montreal, the video is directed by celebrated young Canadian director Xavier Dolan, who helmed feature films Mommy and Tom at the Farm. \nOscar-winner Adele gave fans an insight into her third album via a Facebook and Twitter post on Wednesday, three days after she had teased a snippet from a song during a commercial break on ITV’s X Factor. \nThe Skyfall star’s message said: “My last record was a break-up record and if I had to label this one I would call it a make-up record. I’m making up with myself.” Promoted stories \nShe added: “Making up for lost time. Making up for everything I ever did and never did. But I haven’t got time to hold onto the crumbs of my past like I used to. What’s done is done.” \nReflecting on her youth, Adele said she wished her years away. “When I turned 12 I just wanted to be 18. Then after that I stopped wanting to be older,” she wrote. \n“Now I’m ticking 16-24 boxes just to see if I can blag it! I feel like I’ve spent my whole life so far wishing it away. Always wishing I was older, wishing I was somewhere else … Wishing I hadn’t ruined so many good things because I was scared or bored.” \nThe Rolling in the Deep singer also revealed celebrating her 25th birthday felt like a “turning point”. \n“Teetering on the edge of being an old adolescent and a fully-fledged adult, I made the decision to go into becoming who I’m going to be forever without a removal van of my old junk,” she continued. \n“I miss everything about my past, the good and the bad, but only because it won’t come back. When I was in it, I wanted out! So typical. I’m on about being a teenager, sitting around and chatting s**t, not caring about the future because it didn’t matter then like it does now. \n“The ability to be flippant about everything and there be no consequences. Even following and breaking rules … is better than making the rules.” \nThe singer became a mother in October 2012, when she gave birth to son Angelo with boyfriend Simon Konecki.
