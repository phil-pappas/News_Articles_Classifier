Management already knew it, even before the Mets pantsed the Cubs in the National League Championship Series.\nIt’s not just that the Cubs offense finished historically bad with a .164 batting average in getting swept by the Mets. It’s also that the Cubs had no chance of getting through October with a rotation of Lester, Jake Arrieta and Mommy Make It Stop.\nJoe Maddon’s post-mortem after the Mets swept the Cubs out of 2015 included a wish list that was topped by starting pitching. No surprise there.\nTheo Epstein said adding at least one quality starting pitcher was a priority, either in free agency the way the Cubs came through last winter with Lester or via trade. No surprise there, either.\nIf you’re really good at the top of your pitching staff and have a versatile batting order that doesn’t rely on just home runs, then you probably can have Jason Hammel or Kyle Hendricks in your playoff rotation, but not both.\nNot if you expect to win something big.\nUnder no circumstances.\nNever.\nEver.\nThat’s a law, I believe, or it will be by the time the Winter Meetings begin.\nSpeaking of the Winter Meetings, it’s never too early to speculate on the Cubs’ signing free-agent aces David Price or Zack Greinke, or maybe Jeff Samardzija, who has stumbled to the middle of the rotation, although he would be at the bottom if we’re talking Mets staff.\nIt’s also never too early to talk about bodies to move. Take a bow, Starlin Castro and Jorge Soler.\nCastro played well enough the last two months to perhaps bring back a No. 3 starter. Maybe some team still thinks he’s a shortstop. It takes just one team – hello again, Padres? --- and that makes his contract more palatable.\nOf the two prominent pieces of Cubs trade bait, I think Castro is more valuable right now than Soler, what with Soler’s regularly scheduled injuries, lousy fielding and fear of October weather.\nI mean, if the Mets ever agreed to renew trade talks with the Cubs involving any piece of that young pitching once they lose Yoenis Cespedes and Daniel Murphy to free agency, they’re unlikely to want a guy paralyzed during the most important season of the year.\nBut again, it just takes one team that hopefully didn’t see him layered up like this was the Iditarod.\nMaybe it’s an American League team --- just one team that sees Soler for the designated hitter that he is.\nMaybe it’s a warm-weather team. Maybe it’s a dome-team. It takes just one team with major-league-ready arms willing to pay big because it believes it needs Nanook of Right Field.\nHowever it goes, I expect Epstein’s pitch to be better than most of Hammel’s.\n Major League Baseball Chicago Cubs Jorge Soler New York Mets Jon Lester Starlin Castro Jason Hammel", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562a37d0/turbine/ct-cubs-pitching-trades-free-agents-rosenbloom20151023"], "published": "2015-10-23T16:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:18:14.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
