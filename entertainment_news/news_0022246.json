But the song's flow suffers with A$AP Rocky's bewildering (if trendy) interlude - a minor hiccup on an otherwise seamless album. \"Same Old Love\" starts off with a whimsical '60s feel, but morphs into a punchy bass dance track.\n\"Body Heat\" is on odd saxophone infused Latino drum dance floor scorcher, but it's \"Survivors\" that true trance-house addicts will fall for. \"Kill Them With Kindness\" is an approachable dance track with added bells and whistles (literally), while \"Sober\" brings '80s synthesizers to the fore.\n Music Associated Press", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-09T20:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:15:06.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
