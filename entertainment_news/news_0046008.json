She has also discovered the Christian faith. Back at Langley, Dar Adal (F. Murray Abraham) and Saul (Mandy Patinkin) get a field report -- a grim one -- from Peter Quinn (Rupert Friend), back from a special ops mission combating ISIS. \"Is our strategy working?\" he is asked. \"Tell me what our strategy is,\" says Quinn, \"and I'll tell you if it's working.\"\nMY SAY After Showtime announced the fifth season would be set in Germany, there was the easy, obvious and all too cynical assumption to be made that the series got production tax credits to go there. After all, New York -- even Toronto -- aren't getting any cheaper...\nBut so much for the cynic's take: Berlin works here, and works well.\nTV Best TV show dramas of the 21st century Those gray skies. That language. That history.\nMost of all that recent history. This is a country still atoning for past crimes -- a compelling backdrop for Carrie, who is making atonements of her own. Sunday's open perfectly captures her unexpected spiritual journey, or perhaps the better word here is \"detour.\"\nHer drawn, pale face looks up at the cross, with just the slightest affect of puzzlement, as if to say: But can Jesus save me?\nThe search for Carrie's soul has preoccupied the last four seasons. That's always been contrasted with the more cosmic search for answers that her country -- our country -- continues to undertake in the age of terrorism: What are the ethical quandaries in this battle? Do those breach (or eviscerate) personal liberties? Drone strikes (last season)? Innocent civilians as collateral victims? And now a horrifying refugee crisis -- a central focus this Sunday?\nAny easy answers . . . anyone?\nAt its best, \"Homeland\" never thought so.\n@Newsday Tweets from @Newsday/newsday-staff In the fifth, the series shifts its gaze to Europe, deepening the meaning of that vitally important word \"homeland.\" Germany -- once forbiddingly the Fatherland -- is seen here as just another \"front\" in the war. But privacy laws are so stringent that even Google street view cars are about as welcome as Uber cars are in Paris.\nMeanwhile, the bad guys are out there.\nHiding in plain sight.\nCarrie and her conflicted soul have their work cut out for them.\nBOTTOM LINE Smart, taut, engaging and propulsive. The fifth looks terrific.\nGRADE A\n ", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/Newsday", "https://twitter.com/Newsday/newsday-staff"], "published": "2015-10-01T00:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T16:12:01.249+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
