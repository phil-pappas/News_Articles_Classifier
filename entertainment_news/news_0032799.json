Held at the Pavilion East on Fatherland Street, the show featured several musicians and singer/songwriters performing songs of love, peace and unity.\n“‘Partnerships for Peace-Dignity for All’ is the UN theme this year, and that’s what this concert is all about--human relations and individual dignity,” said Brian Fesler, coordinator of Tennessee United for Human Rights.\nConcert attendees enjoyed Americana singer/songwriter Jon Statham, while children did art projects, got their faces painted and played in a bouncy house. Veterans for Peace alongside Tennessee United for Human Rights volunteers passed out information and had concert attendees sign petitions to government asking for the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nFollowing Statham was Joseph Bell, the front man of the critically acclaimed “Who’s Bad” Michael Jackson Tribute Tour, and Bianca Moon, an Emmy-nominated songwriter, recognized for her song “The Bold and the Beautiful.”\nDove Award Nominee and Gospel Pop Artist T-Ran Gilbert performed original songs including his hits “Need You Now,” and “Breathe.” Then religious leaders took the stage for a World Prayer for Peace.\nClosing out the night, American songwriting icon Melanie performed to tumultuous applause and a captivated audience. Melanie is best known for her hit songs “Brand New Key” and “What Have they Done to My Song, Ma?” She was also an original performer at Woodstock and an ambassador for the United Nations in the 1970s. At the end of the night, everyone was led by Melanie to light a candle for peace.\nFor more information, visit TennesseeHumanRights.org.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T07:54:04.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
