Dickson M.D. the Chief Operating Officer of MED-C. \"This project focuses the efforts and strengths of all major stakeholders (patients, providers, payors, regulators, pharma, and industry/laboratories) into building one of the greatest advances in personalized medicine ever undertaken. The generous support of these companies in both donations and expertise has allowed us to get this started. We hope that many others will join with them in helping us rapidly advance medicine in a way that we can only accomplish by working together.\"\nAfter this pilot project gets off the ground, and as further support is obtained, MED-C plans to open up the NGS registry to other disease states and then through affiliated projects explore testing in areas such as proteomics, immunology, metabolomics, etc. Also, MED-C hopes that the registry will develop a strong future affiliation with clinical trials, thereby dramatically improving accrual in those already open (like the NCI-MATCH, Lung-MAP, ASCO TAPUR, etc.) and future trials that will be crucial to unlocking personalized medicine.\nFor further information, please contact MED-C at (208) 970-0244.\n release/medc-secures-cornerstone-funding-414613.php", "external_links": ["http://www.24-7pressrelease.com/press-release/medc-secures-cornerstone-funding-414613.php", "http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"], "published": "2015-10-23T11:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:40:24.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
