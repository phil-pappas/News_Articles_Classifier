Director VV Vinayak will helm the landmark film which will be a remake of Tamil superstar Vijay's blockbuster Kaththi which was a directorial of AR Murugadoss.\n\"After listening to several scripts including the one announced with Puri Jagannadh, Chiru felt the Kaththi's plot would suit him perfectly. The story has political undertones as well besides having ample scope for entertainment,\" reveals a source in the know.\nInterestingly, Chiru will be collaborating with the same writer-director duo that worked on the 2003 hit Tagore — a story written by AR Murugadoss under the direction of VV Vinayak. \"When the director penned the script of Kaththi, he had readied a draft of 30 minutes for the Telugu version too. However, things didn't work out and he had to let go of it. A well-known writer is now working on the script and it is possible that Murugadoss' inputs will go into it too,\" adds the source.\nChiru will be playing a double role — that of a petty thief and a guy who is desperately trying to save his village from an MNC. \"The story will be tweaked a bit though, and entertainment quotient will go a notch higher,\" adds the source.
