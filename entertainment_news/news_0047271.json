The mom of three is drop dead gorgeous in a completely naked photo! on.aol.com Kourtney Kardashian does what the Kardashian women do best and that is she took off all her clothes to pose nude for Vanity Fair. Glamour , October 7, 2015, reported that Kourtney, the former lover of Scott Disick and the mother to his three children, posed nude for the magazine and she posted a picture on her Twitter page. Professional photographer Brian Bowen Smith took the pictures for a series called Metallic Life. The pictures are printed on metallic paper, with no gloss, and it is said to show off or enhance the \"tantalizing textures of skin.\" The pictures of Kourtney and other nude models will be on display in Los Angeles at the De Re Gallery from October 22 to November 19.\nPhoto by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Since Kourtney kicked Scott out of her home and out of her life, she has been posting pictures of herself looking super sexy wearing skimpy bathing suits and other form hugging attire. She isn’t about to let Scott forget how toned and fabulous her body is even after three pregnancies. Kourtney Kardashian allegedly only posed nude one other time and Brian Bowen Smith was the one who took that picture as well. It was for DuJour magazine published in December 2014, and it was while Kourtney was pregnant with Reign at the time. If Scott feels bad that he lost Kourtney or ashamed for his drinking, partying and playing with ex-girlfriends and teenage girls, he’s not letting it show. Tabloid headlines are full of which party he is at and whom he is with. Meanwhile, Kourtney is doing her thing, while her son Mason attends therapy sessions and misses school to do \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians.\"\nHowever, the comments posted on People and The Huffington Post is less than complimentary and many of the posters are not surprised that Kourtney is following in her sisters footsteps to pose nude. They feel that she should know better because she is a mother of three young kids and she is disrespecting herself by doing the nude photo shoot. One asked the question, “Why are these girls always taking their clothes off?” while another said, “Man what a lame attempt to stick it to that deadbeat scottyboy. Could she be any more predictable!?” Some wondered how big the check was that Kris had to write to get them to include Kourtney in the magazine. Another claimed that it was a “family of centerfolds and nothing more.” And one poster asked, “Has anyone in that family “not” been photographed naked for Vanity Fair?” What do you think about Kourtney Kardashian posing nude? Are you for it or do you think she should be the sensible one in the family?", "external_links": ["http://www.people.com/article/kourtney-kardashian-nude-photos-vanity-fair", "https://twitter.com/kourtneykardash", "http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/photos/2015/10/kourtney-kardashian-nude-metallic-life", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kourtney-kardashian-nude-vanity-fair_56143c79e4b0fad15919f61e", "http://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/news/celebrity/2015/10/07/kourtney-kardashian-nude-picture-for-brian-bowen-metallic-life-series"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:42:31.635+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
