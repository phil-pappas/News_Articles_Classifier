Did you get Sanjay Gupta to change his?\" \nShe replied, \"It's wonderful to be able to contribute the way directors have always allowed me to. I have always done that since the beginning and acknowledge that. Most filmmakers till date have given me that liberty, indulged me, allowed me or just accorded me that mutual respect. It is respectful to allow people to share their opinions.\" Have You Seen These Childhood Pictures Of Tiger Shroff With Rekha & Jackie Shroff? She added, \"It's wonderful that I have enjoyed that relationship and I have been allowed that opportunity. I will give my creative viewpoint because it's never about me individually. My opinions will be about everything - script, parts of the story and my directors recognise that. I must admit that Sanjay has been wonderful about it, too. Sanjay has been superlative in allowing for that.\"Well, that's what Aish has to say! Meanwhile, check out her rare pictures with Bollywood's Mr Perfectionist, Aamir Khan. OMG!
