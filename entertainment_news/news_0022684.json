(Aric Crabb/Bay Area News Group) ( ARIC CRABB ) OAKLAND -- It was a carnival atmosphere Sunday at the sixth annual East Bay Mini Maker Faire. A brass band blared pop hits as children and adults hula hooped and Heather Davison made a mighty leap to smack a dangling hand in a game of Ultimate High Five. \n\"You're never too old to play,\" she said. \nIt was the kind of atmosphere people have come to expect from the DIY festival, which takes place every year on the grounds of Park Day School, a private K-8 grade school in the Temescal District. Davison's 10-year-old daughter Lily Borrill was also there, waiting for a turn on a pedal-powered, spinning ride while in the background a metal shape belched fire and the hum of drones competed with the clack of a knitting machine. For the festival, an offshoot of the popular Maker Faire that originated in San Mateo, this is no collection of oddities -- it's just a normal lineup.

(Aric Crabb/Bay Area News Group) ( ARIC CRABB ) \n\"It's an amazing festival,\" Borrill said. \nGetting that reaction from children as well as adults is part of the point. The ethos of both the mini maker faires and the licensing organization, Maker Media, is to encourage creativity through tinkering, discovering and building. \nFor host Park Day School, it's a way to participate in a DIY movement that is being included in ever more school curricula. The school prides itself in its \"Innovation Shed\" and had booths on rocket making and toy hacking. There were also children presenting projects from private schools such as Julia Morgan School for Girls, Bentley, Black Pine Circle, East Bay School for Boys and Prospect Sierra. But public schools like Piedmont High and Vacaville High were there too, and charter schools like the Francophone School of Oakland and Lighthouse Community Charter School. Sonoma State University was even there to show off its \"Maker Certificate Program\" for teachers.

She said that six years ago, during the first festival, few kids did that kind of creative tinkering in schools. \n\"Now it's huge,\" she said. \nA lot of people come for the clever electronics or innovative robotics, but the festival also had rope-twisting and screen-printing. It featured an Oakland turf-dancing troupe and a contraption called the Octoplayer, created by Thad Povey and Mark Taylor, that plays eight records at once, creating a hypnotic accumulation of sound. \n\"You have your audiophiles that go, 'Oh my God, I can't believe it,'\" said Taylor. \nAccording to organizer Sabrina Merlo, that mix is important, because it inspires. And she should know. The first East Bay Mini Maker Faire was so successful that now she's working for Maker Media and traveling the world. \n\"We'll be over 150 fires in 30 countries,\" she said.

(Aric Crabb/Bay Area News Group) ( ARIC CRABB ) \nThe \"mini\" faires like the East Bay Mini Maker Faire are planned, programmed and run by independent locals but licensed from Maker Media, which assists with organization, branding and promotion. Maker Media also hosts its own festivals, including the original Maker Faire in San Mateo. \nLast year's Oakland faire saw around 7,000 visitors, according to Merlo, and it's expected to be the same this year. That's about as much as Park Day School can take. The grounds were packed and everyone seemed to be involved in some new activity -- even first-timers Davison and her daughter. \n\"I'm sold,\" Davison said. \"I'll be here next year.\" Camille Antinori watches her daughter Rosa Antinori create a light show with a computer program during the East Bay Mini Maker Faire on Sunday, Oct. 18, 2015, in Oakland, Calif.
