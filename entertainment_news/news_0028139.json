I just rubbed my eye and it's burning because of these mushrooms,\" Moor says. \"A friend of ours went into the forest and picked these giant mushrooms. They're about as big as your head. He assured us they were OK to eat. I hope he's right.\"\nThe guitarist weathers the fungal assault with a good-natured laugh and returns to the business at hand: reflecting on the long-running career of The Ex, the Dutch post-punk collective that has left a legacy of jaw-dropping concerts and uncompromising albums since its formation in the late '70s, often with a social and political twist in the lyrics. Besides its own albums, the band (which also includes founding guitarist Terrie Hessels, drummer Katherina Bornefeld and singer-guitarist Arnold de Boer) has performed with a wide array of musicians, from Ethiopian saxophonist Getatchew Mekurya to avant-jazz cellist Tom Cora. Chicago saxophonist Ken Vandermark, is a frequent collaborator; he's touring with the band this month.\nThe jazz veteran and The Ex met at a festival in Europe about a decade ago, and have collaborated on two albums. Their musical personalities are well-matched, the saxophonist's voracious curiosity matching The Ex's improvisational zeal.\n\"What I look for in a musician is not technical skills or virtuosity -- although Ken has that -- but how they play, their commitment,\" Moor says. \"He fits great with The Ex because he's not just playing a melody on top, but he's thinking about how sound works. He plays rhythmically, he searches for what's needed in whatever musical environment he's in. None of us know where it's going to go, and that's exciting.\"\nIn a separate interview, Vandermark described The Ex as a rock band that isn't beholden to form or convention.\n\"I remember seeing Terrie and Andy playing in a group (that included Chicago drummer Hamid Drake) at a festival where they asked me to sit in, and it was extraordinary,\" he says. \"They started kicking this milk crate around like a soccer ball, and Terrie's like, 'Come on out.' I thought, 'What am I getting into?' \"\nThat sense of anything-can-happen makes it \"kind of impossible to describe The Ex's music in a few words,\" the saxophonist adds. \"The list of adjectives gets longer and longer with each project they take on. For me, they're an extension of the post-punk movement in late-'70s England when bands like the Fall, Wire and Gang of Four were finding new ways to work with rhythm and the tunes were more open-ended rather than sticking with verse-chorus structure. It's liberating as a musician to be a part of something like that.\"\nLike Vandermark, Moor doesn't have much use for genre boundaries. The attitude makes The Ex impossible to pigeonhole.\n\"In Germany we still get called 'anarcho punk,' \" he says. \"The only problem with labels is they do not open people's minds, or make people curious. These labels tend to reduce our music. We all listen to so many different kinds of music -- not just punk or guitar music, but African, Jamaican dancehall, cumbia, Brazilian, Colombian. All these styles trickle in. We're just not interested in divisions and genres, which is why we can play with all these different people. All these projects keep the horizon wide and exciting for us.\"\nIt also explains how The Ex has kept performing and recording at such a high level for 36 years, despite a do-it-yourself business model that does not lend itself to wealth and fame.\nFinancially, \"it's really hand to mouth, with no back-up,\" Moor says. \"If we don't play for a year, we're (in trouble). That keeps our edge, keeps us going in a bit of an urgent way. We have quite simple lives, and I don't think we ever thought of this as a way to make lots of money. On this trip to America, we're trying not to lose money. We don't feel welcome by the bureaucracy. We've spent a lot of money getting our visas and forms in order, and if something goes wrong and we don't get our visas in time, we lose a lot.\"\nYet the group defies the obstacles by focusing on what matters most. \"They've had a lot of different lineups, but in each situation the creativity the band puts into not trying to do what they did before is unbelievably inspiring,\" Vandermark says. \"To remain that open to change and to create within that for that long is really extraordinary. So few bands in any field are doing that.\"\nThe notion of what's next in the music has bonded the band members across several decades. Moor laughs when it's suggested that a band is more like a marriage to multiple partners -- a series of relationships that is not easily maintained over the long haul.\n\"I don't see it as a marriage, but more like a dysfunctional family -- or maybe a functional family,\" he says. \"We don't do long tours. Who wants to spend more than two weeks in a tiny little van with the same people year after year? No wonder bands break up. We keep the band in perspective with the rest of our lives, so we can have families, a home, a half-normal life. Then when we get back together, there's the energy that comes with looking forward.\"\n(c)2015 Chicago Tribune\nVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1742542&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1742542&h=The+Ex+and+Ken+Vandermark+trample+genre+borders+together", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1742542"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:14:34.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
