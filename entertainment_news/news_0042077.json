Lord has said, “At this point I find that writing out my life’s more intriguing escapades is a very pleasant way to while away my time.”\nPublished by New York City-based Page Publishing, Lord Christian Halliday’s outrageous and tantalizing tale contains some of his recollections due to their humorous outcomes and others for their overall uniqueness.\nThen there are those tales which are so absolutely implausible that they are solely included so that the reader can express their 100 percent utter disbelief, much to the amusement of the author. If the memoirs comprising these early years of youth and beyond serves to inspire the sensual imagination to roam free, as Mr. Halliday believes they shall, then his self-imposed task of placing these words on paper has been a successful use of time.\nReaders who wish to experience this provocative work can purchase “Memoirs of a Gigolo - My Early Years” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708 or Lord Christian Halliday at LordHalliday(at)aol(dot)com and/or through Facebook at http://www.facebook/LordHalliday .\nAbout Page Publishing:\nPage Publishing is a traditional New York based full-service publishing house that handles all of the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
