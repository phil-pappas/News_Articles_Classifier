But the actor says he is not sure whether his “past will be a centre point” on the controversial reality TV show. “I’m not new to controversies or negativity. These things happen and when they do the only thing you can do is take the things with a pinch of salt and move forward.

The actor has worn many hats. Be it acting on the small screen or silver screen or hosting TV shows, he has done it all. And now Aman is one of the 14 contestants of the ninth season of the reality TV show, which is yet again hosted by superstar Salman Khan. \nThe show with theme “double trouble” went on air on Sunday on Colors channel. Aman asserts that if any of the contestants tries to rake up the old controversy, then they should be ready for what they are getting into. “If some contestant brings up my past, they should be ready to meet their past as well,” he said. \n“I don’t know why an actor is subjected to the same questions over his/her controversy every time. I think people get some kind of enjoyment by others trouble. That is sad but true,” said the actor, who gained popularity with fiction shows like “Kyunki… Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi” and “Kumkum”. \nThe reality show, an Indian version of international series “Celebrity Big Brother”, is known for its controversies and constant brickbats. Celebrities get locked inside a house for three months under constant camera surveillance, without any gadgets or luxury. But Aman is not bothered about such things, and notes his behaviour will depend on the events inside the house. “I hope I conduct myself in a wonderful manner and I’m able to come out as a well behaved person. My attitude in the house will depend on how the contestants behave with me,” he said, while adding that he will miss his family the most during his stay inside the house. \nModified Date: October 13, 2015 6:43 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T16:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:19:45.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
