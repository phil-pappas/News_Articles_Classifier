He proclaims, \"Life is a journey deserving of Graceful Departures\" and offers an eBook titled \"Sail the 7 C's of Graceful Departures,\" a resource to navigate from here to the afterworld with ease and tranquility.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151001/272955\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151001/272950\nAs we mark Columbus Day on Oct. 12 , Haselhorst reminds us that the world was once thought to be flat and changing perceptions is challenging. Traditional medicine has been slow to recognize the sea of patients caught in the rip current of intervention with no lifeline to a \"good death.\" He says, \"From years of practicing emergency medicine I can attest to patients and caregivers admirably fighting the good fight and becoming exhausted and harmed in the process. I care for people who work too hard against their better nature, neglecting to align their ailments and afflictions with acceptance and compassion. The end of suffering often occurs with easing up, enlightenment, and vacation.\"\nIndeed, Haselhorst compares the time to die with taking a spa vacation or retreat, a well-deserved grace period at the end of a life well lived. \"A person only rests in peace when the mind quiets and the heart speaks. The discipline of listening to the heart was not taught [to me] while I attended Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, but on a yoga mat.\"\nOn Jan. 1 Medicare will begin paying physicians to have \"the talk\" with patients about the facts of life and death. Graceful Departures offers terms of engagement for this discussion:\nGround rules for maintaining dignity Timeframe for ending unnecessary intervention Introspection prior to discussion Pretest with questions for discussion Heartening conversation leading to peaceful resolution ABOUT THE AUTHOR\nKevin Haselhorst is an emergency medicine physician affiliated with Abrazo Health Care in Phoenix .
