That’s why I’m so honoured to participate in Billboard’s first philanthropy issue. \n“Through the years, I’ve done my best to use the incredible platform that I’ve been blessed with to make a difference, particularly in the fight against Aids.” \nOn the cover, Gaga tenderly frames Elton’s head with her hands, while both look straight at the camera. The picture is in black and white, with the headline underneath reading: “We can be heroes.” \nThe two have been close for some time – last year Gaga revealed that Elton “saved” her from a two-year drug battle. \nShe told the Sun: “It’s pretty messed up being friends with people who used to have drug and alcohol problems, like Elton. \n“He got me on the straight and narrow. He was telling me ‘Gaga, you’re smoking too much’. He saved me.” Share article Lady Gaga and Elton John (Jason DeCrow/AP) Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T18:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:35:08.309+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
