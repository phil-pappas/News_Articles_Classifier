ComputED Gazette once again chose Istation Advanced Reading as the winner of the EDDIE (Educational Software Review) Award in the Upper Elementary Reading category. Istation Early Reading received the EDDIE Award for best Early Elementary Reading program. Istation received the same awards in 2014 as well.\nThe EDDIE Awards target innovative and content-rich programs and websites that augment classroom curriculum and improve teacher productivity, providing parents and teachers with the technology to foster educational excellence. Entrants are judged on academic content, potential for broad classroom use, technical merit, subject approach and management system.\n“Our goal is to develop educational technology that helps students learn and teachers teach,” said Istation Chairman and CEO Richard H. Collins. “For Istation Reading to win back-to-back EDDIE Awards is a real tribute to our team. We are honored.”\nIn April, Istation Reading won ComputED Gazette’s BESSIE (Best Educational Software) Awards for the third year in a row. In May, Istation’s Advanced Reading assessment received a 2015 Software and Information Industry Association CODiE Award for Best Educational App for a Mobile Device.\nAbout Istation\nIstation is an award-winning comprehensive e-learning program used by more than four million students and educators across the world.
