I jumped in a taxi and the driver had the game blaring on the radio. And when I entered the building where I was going, security guards and others were huddled over their smartphones getting updates.\nBy the time I left, the Cubs had won the National League Division Series 3-1, beating the St. Louis Cardinals. Jubilant strangers were high-fiving one another and spreading the news: \"We won! We won!\"\nIt's no surprise that our sports teams lift our spirits and connect us. But I've been wondering about the psychology behind why we feel so much for our teams. Why do they have the power to make us feel good, even when all around us may be falling apart? And why does rooting for a team bring us into this grand, shared human experience? (OK, I know that not everybody is loving on the Cubs.)\nI talked to Susan Krauss Whitbourne, a professor of psychology at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and a blogger for Psychology Today. In 2011, she penned a piece on the psychology of sports fans and the phenomenon called \"BIRGing,\" from a 1970s study, regarding when fans \"bask in the reflected glory\" of their teams.\nShe said winning teams give us a \"holiday feeling.\" We feel cheerier, a bit more optimistic. And, with each win, we have something to look forward to. It's like Christmas Eve, over and over.\n\"There's a rush of pleasurable feelings,\" she told me \"You're high-fiving strangers and seeing everyone engrossed in this one thing. It makes you feel like you have something in common with players and people geographically close to you.\"\nShe said one study on the psychological effect of sports teams showed that the closer the team is to you, the greater the impact likely will be.\nFans remember loved ones in Cubs heaven on Facebook Alison Bowen Some people lived a lifetime without seeing the Cubs clinch a post-season series in Chicago.\nOne way family members are paying homage to Cubs fans that passed away?

Facebook.\nSome Chicago fans are sharing Cubs exhilaration with family members on the social media sharing site — messages like \"I...\n(Alison Bowen) Earlier this year, I, a lifelong Bears fan, recognized this while living in Boston and found myself rooting for the New England Patriots as the team steamrolled competitors on its way to winning the Super Bowl. (Let's not talk about Deflategate.)\nI didn't expect to be a bandwagon jumper, but I was.\nWhitbourne said going to the game offers its own psychological boost. The roar of the crowd, and the way the sound vibrates through you. The smell of the hot dogs. The feel of the afternoon air against your skin. All of that creates a moment, a mood.\n\"There's a tendency for moods to spread, or a social contagion,\" she said. \"It's why people laugh harder at the theater than they do at home. One of the reasons people get so fixated on a team is the whole experience of being in the environment.\"\nAnd, it's not just about our love of a team but our feelings of nostalgia.\n\"You may have a history of having gone to a game when you were younger,\" Whitbourne said. \"You're there and meeting the other season ticket holders. You may be complete strangers, but you feel like you share some part of a past.\"\nAround town: Eddie Vedder celebrates Cubs' wins at Stanley's Luis Gomez Cubs players had planned on celebrating at Stanley’s Kitchen and Tap if they would have won the National League Pennant in 2003, according to Stanley’s owner Donnie Kruse.

The pride in your local team even if you don't care a lot about sports makes you feel good. And, the deeper you are involved with a team, the more likely you are to stick it out during the bad times. We Chicagoans know bad times.\n\"When you're a true fan, the more likely you are to take pride in a team's badness,\" Whitbourne said. \"You can look at the sports memorabilia a fan is wearing. The true Cubs or Mets fan will wear the T-shirt no matter what happens with the game. But a fair-weather fan may toss it.\"\nSports teams have tried to help fans marshal this collective goodwill and can-do spirit into causes such as fighting breast cancer, violence and poverty.\nLastly, here's something to keep in mind: Whitbourne said die-hard fans should not make big decisions on the day after their team loses.\n\"They're cognitively impaired,\" she said. \"There are studies of this. You make poorer decisions.\" (The opposite of \"BIRGing\" is \"CORFing,\" or \"cut off reflected failure,\" the disgrace and sadness a fan feels when his or her team loses.)\nWhitbourne said Cubs fans should enjoy the ride while it lasts. As a longtime, long-suffering Buffalo Bills football fan, she knows that die-hards feel a connection to a team that's losing, too.\n\"But everybody in Buffalo is just shocked that the Bills are winning this year,\" she said. \"And while many of us would happily watch them take a trip to the Super Bowl, longtime fans take great pride in remembering when they were the only ones in the stands.\"\ndmturner@tribpub.com\n Buffalo Bills National League St. Louis Cardinals New England Patriots Breast Cancer Opinion Commentary", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561e667e/turbine/ct-eddie-vedder-cubs-stanleys-20151014", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561eb675/turbine/ct-cubs-winning-fans-unite-dawn-turner-20151014", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561e9308/turbine/sc-fam-cubs-social-media-family-20151014"], "published": "2015-10-14T23:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:21:06.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
