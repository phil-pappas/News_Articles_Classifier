Tom Hanks has your Fordham University's I.D. \nEntertainment Industry News.Net (ANI) : Wednesday 7th October, 2015 \nLauren, a student from Fordham University, is incredibly lucky as none other than Tom Hanks has found her college I.D., which she probably had dropped in a park. \nThe 59-year-old actor posted a picture of Lauren's I.D. on twitter and wrote \"Lauren! I found your Student ID in the park. If you still need it my office will get to you. Hanx,\" E!Online reports. \nAt first, it was unclear if Lauren was aware of the news that Hanks had reached out to her. However, a few of her friends were quick to offer their services to get the card from the star. \nOne of Lauren's professor took to twitter and said \"@tomhanks she's one of my students! Let me know if I can get it for her!\" \nLauren told E!News that she has contacted Tom via his Facebook but has not heard back, so she hopes he sees this story so she can get her old I.D. back.
