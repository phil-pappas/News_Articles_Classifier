Brendan Read Cars For Sale \nCLASSICAL trail-blazing flautist Jane Rutter has paved the way for many younger classical stars. \nWith 21 solo recordings and several guest appearances and group albums, Jane was the first Australian classical musician of her calibre to take fine music out to the masses - she has played at the Sydney Opera House concert hall, the famed cabaret room at the Tilbury Hotel, on the hill at the footy grand final and at the Musica Viva Recitals. \nIn 2014 Jane released two extraordinary albums, Vivaldi the Four Seasons and Flute Spirit: Dreams and Improvisations. \nAt first glance these appear to be from opposite sides of the spectrum, yet Jane declares that both reflect the flute as the oldest instrument known to man, and are about man's unique relationship to Planet Earth, the seasons and the universe. \nJane has created a performance piece around the two albums. Flute Spirits and the Four Seasons is Jane's take on the world's most popular classical piece: Vivaldi's The Four Seasons. \nThe piece proves it to be entirely suited to virtuoso flute: Vivaldi's dynamic, vivid portrait of the moods and activities of the seasons was one of the most innovative works of its day. \nJane remains faithful to Vivaldi's original, and introduces new sounds and textures which just aren't possible on the violin. \nJane returns to Lismore after a sell-out concert in 2014 and will be joined for one piece by a very special ensemble made up of aspiring young musicians. \nThe Northern Rivers Conservatorium presents this event with the support of Trinity Catholic College. \nAt Champagnat Theatre, Trinity Catholic College, Leycester St, Lismore, on Friday, October 16, from 7.30pm, $40. classical music", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:19:37.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
