Every Thursday, musicians will perform from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. (two sets with a break in between) on the concourse level of the Jamaica AirTrain Station at 93-40 Sutphin Blvd. Those interested in participating should contact Greg Mays at AirTrainJazz@abetterjamaica.org. The organizers provide a $500 compensation for artists.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T02:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:57:53.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
