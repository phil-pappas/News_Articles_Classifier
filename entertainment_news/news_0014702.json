He stood strong when challenging his Superior's wit and wrongdoings when it came to mistreatment, not only as a soldier, but a human being. No matter where he was stationed, he upheld the highest standards for himself and all those around him even when times were hard. He left the door open to be friends with those who wronged him. A personal sacrifice was made to directly or indirectly cause those to abide by not only military regulation but God given rights.\nMr. McDonald didn't think he would be too black to serve, and not black enough to fit in which mirrored his father’s military experience. Thomas had friends from both races end their lives because of the adversity. If nothing is done, this cycle will never be broken. McDonald’s mind and life are forever altered.\nReaders who wish to experience this enlightening work can purchase “I’m Tellin’” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708.\nAbout Page Publishing\nPage Publishing is a traditional New York based full-service publishing house that handles all of the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
