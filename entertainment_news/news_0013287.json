Photograph by: Mark van Manen , PNG \nI just didn't have the heart to shout out that they wouldn't grow. Whether they were organic or GMO Monsanto specials, the seeds being strewn around the stage pre-show by two Johnny Appleseed characters just seemed silly. Actually, the larger worry was would the marquee act or a member of his band slip. \nThen the opening notes of After the Gold Rush echoed out and there was Neil Young playing solo piano with his trusty harmonica apparatus and it was epic. \nHe strapped on his acoustic and played Heart of Gold. Is it possible this classic from 1972's Harvest is his finest moment? \nThere were so many in the Neil Youmg + Promise of the Real's Rebel Content show at Rogers Arena. \nReinvigorated by his irk at - well - everything - Young is like a really angry former hippie yelling at the kids to get off his manicured organic Kitsilano lawn and that's fine. Particularly if you are one of those seventies sorts who likes hours of the same guitar solos all night long. \nHe is hyped up enough to make Helpless sound like a new tune - crazy. \n\"I'd like to thank you for coming and laying down your dollars\" said Young who donated $100,000 of last night's proceeds to David Suzuki's Blue Dot Foundation. Nice rock star pocket change indeed and in a press conference earlier in the day he outlined his commitment to the organization's goal. \nEarlier on the show had been raising funds for a First Nations issue but this was changed. \nAs to how exciting it must be for Promise of the Real - Young's backing band lead by Willie Nelson's son Lukas - to be backing Young on Out on the Weekend? Let us just say that the group was a fine mix of Crazy Horse thud and Austin Mexican-tinged alt-country elegance with a bit of CSN &Y harmonies thrown in. And guitar solos. Lots. \nThey deserve the job based on the harmonies on Harvest Moon alone. So fine. \nYoung lead the band through 20-plus tunes including some from their album together, The Monsanto Years. \nCredit for Promise of the Real for keeping it real and allowing the jam room required of any Young show. But let's not kid ourselves that the highlights were all older material. \nNo matter. Hearing some of his greats won't get old ever. Others, such as Cowgirl in the Sand suffered from far too much repetitive “rocking out.” \nIn fact, the entire final third of the performance had that problem. \nPersonally, I hope this unit comes back and does another disc with the added comfort level that comes with an album/tour cycles. Neil Young + Promise of the Real just might give Shakey another classic. A Rock Star Bucks A Coffee Shop is awesome. Ditto Big Box. \nA better opener for Young than City and Colour would have been hard to pick. Like so many Canadian singer/songwriters, Dallas Green has Young-isms in his material. The big beat, slightly behind it biting lead guitar and those big open tuning electric and acoustic power chords introducing a verse are but a few of the influences you can spot. \nThe difference is Green's increasingly strong voice which hit the first high point in the new Lover Come Back from the upcoming If I Should Go Before You. The album, out this Friday, may well be one of his best. \nThe band played a number of tracks from the new album during its set which were their \"inaguaral performances\" and they sounded sweet. While the songs all originate with just Green and his acoustic, City and Colour are most certainly a band these days with the musical interplay you expect from a road seasoned quintet. \nWhile the solo shows are cool, they aren't anywhere close to what you get with the fat organ - it just adds such wonderful emphasis to the vocals a la the Band. No wonder Green won't talk about Alexisonfire anymore. \nCity and Colour is all that and then some.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T19:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T23:01:45.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
