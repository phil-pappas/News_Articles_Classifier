It is the sound of creation. And echoes of its hum infuse the soundtrack of Steve Jobs, an astonishing creation in its own right. \nWhere to begin to give credit? Aaron Sorkin’s screenplay is truly Sorkinian, a rattle-and-bang affair with lines that fly by so quickly, you’re left 10 minutes later wondering if they actually made any sense. \n“Coach lands on the runway at exactly the same time as first class,” Jobs barks at one point to his head of marketing, who responds that she has no idea what he’s on about. Later she tells him she’s been feeding him erroneous data: “We’ve been managing expectations so that you don’t not.” Come again? \nThen there’s director Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire, 127 Hours), given the thankless task of somehow making all this talk-talk look as interesting as it sounds. And he does: one key scene takes place with a deluge outside a wall of windows, as though it were filmed beneath Niagara Falls. \nThe film’s structure is the antithesis of a biopic. In three acts of 40 minutes each we watch Jobs prepare for the launch of three iconic products: the original Macintosh in 1984; the NeXT Computer, developed during Jobs’ time away from the company and unveiled in 1988; and the first iMac from 1998, the descendent of which may sit on your desk today. \nAs such, we are given a window into just two hours of his life, with a few flashbacks thrown in. \nIt remains an instructive portrait, however. In the first scene — shot in 16mm; the film then moves to 35mm and then high-def digital — Jobs is visited by his ex-girlfriend, played with an endearing fragility by Katherine Waterston. She is seeking more than the paltry court-mandated support payments for her and their daughter, whom the multimillionaire was a long time in admitting was even his. \nHe alternately bullies her and ignores her pleas, but then caves just as quickly, apparently with as little thought as he had previously withstood her. His offer of more money and a house seems like kindness, though showing gratitude for it would be like thanking a hailstorm for putting ice in your drink. \nThe three acts feature a rotating cast of returning players. Kate Winslet is the above-mentioned marketing executive and the only person remotely capable of steering the ocean liner that was Jobs. Jeff Daniels is John Sculley, Apple’s CEO in the Macintosh days. Michael Stuhlbarg is Andy Hertzfeld, a put-upon computer scientist. And Seth Rogen goes full-beard to play Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. \nEach functions as a different facet of Jobs’ conscience, a psychological sub-routine whose constant looping and crashing may have been the biggest flaw in the man’s operating system. \nIf that structure seems too easy, Sorkin beats critics to the punch with a line of dialogue that undercuts his own artifice. Says Jobs: “It’s like five minutes before every launch, everyone goes to a bar and gets drunk and tells me what they really think.” \nI haven’t yet named the actor who breathes life into this character. It is future Oscar nominee Michael Fassbender. \nFassbender’s performance embodies the code of Jobs, if you will. From his insistence that the exit lights be turned off in an auditorium — against the fire code, but leading to a much more dramatic reveal — to his obsession over making the NeXT a perfect cube, never mind what’s inside, to the bizarre practice of washing his feet in the toilet, here is an embodiment that encapsulates genius, moving beyond eccentricity and into something approaching pathology.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:01:34.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
