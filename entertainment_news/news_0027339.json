Visit the Everglades: Viator’s Miami Everglades Airboat Adventure with Biscayne Bay Cruise is a great way to experience the country’s largest subtropical wilderness, with a narrated airboat ride, jungle hike, alligator show, and Biscayne Bay cruise. The private tour by safari-style Jeep delves deep into the heart of Big Cypress National Preserve. For a unique experience, take a Private Night Tour of the Florida Everglades by Airboat.\n2.

Further south, enjoy a stunning South Florida sunset on the Miami Sunset Segway Tour .\n4. Experience Miami From the Air: Explore Miami from your own private helicopter in Viator’s Miami Helicopter Tour , with ample opportunities to take stunning photos of the city and surrounding areas.

Visit The Bahamas: There are few places in the US where you can hop on a boat, visit another country and still be back for a late-night dinner after a day of sunshine and adventure.
