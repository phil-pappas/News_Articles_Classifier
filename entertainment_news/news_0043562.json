Center for Elephant Conservation ® , announced yesterday a new funding effort with Intermountain Primary Children’s Hospital (PCH) and University of Utah Department of Pediatrics oncologist and Huntsman Cancer Institute investigator Dr. Joshua Schiffman. The fundraising commitment comes on the heels of new pediatric cancer research findings published in the Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA) by Dr. Schiffman. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151009005379/en/ Feld Entertainment released an accompanying video package that describes the research. The video can be seen here . Dr. Schiffman and the team from Primary Children’s Hospital, the Department of Pediatrics, and Huntsman Cancer Institute, all in Salt Lake City, Utah, are studying why there is such a low incidence of cancer in elephants, what makes this cancer resistance possible in elephants and not in humans, and how this may correlate to new treatments for pediatric cancers. More than 16,000 children and teenagers are diagnosed with cancer every year in the United States; meanwhile elephants experience almost no cancer over their lifetimes. Dr. Schiffman; Dr. Dennis Schmitt, Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Chair of Veterinary Services and Director of Research; and Dr. Wendy Kiso, Ringling Bros. Center for Elephant Conservation Research and Conservation Scientist; and other scientific collaborators on their team; recently confirmed that elephants rarely develop cancer with a mortality rate of less than 5 percent compared to up to 25 percent in humans. Looking at the elephant genome, they described that elephants have 40 copies of a tumor suppressor gene named TP53 compared to only two copies in humans. Working with Utah's Hogle Zoo and the Ringling Bros. Center for Elephant Conservation , Dr. Schiffman and colleagues studied the response of elephant blood to DNA damaging agents and discovered that elephant cells undergo cell death more rapidly compared to human cells. Dr. Schiffman believes this may be why elephants develop less cancer than humans. The study’s full findings have been published in the new edition of the Journal of American Medical Association . Applying the translational research around cancer – the findings from the basic science that enhance human health and well-being by improving medical and nursing practices and creating meaningful health outcomes – could pave the way for an entirely new frontier of cancer research and treatment, from the laboratory bench to the bedside. The Feld Family is forming the Ringling Bros. Children’s Fund™ as an element of their ongoing philanthropy through the Feld Family Foundation to support children’s charities. As part of the partnership with Primary Children’s Hospital, the Department of Pediatrics, and Dr. Schiffman, the Ringling Bros. Children’s Fund and Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey will be donating more than $1 million to support cancer research and to care for children. In the next 50 cities Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey visits, Ringling Bros. will donate $10,000 to a local children’s hospital or treatment center and the Ringling Bros. Children’s Fund will match each donation with an additional $10,000 donation to the Primary Children’s Hospital Foundation to support the PCH Pediatric Cancer Research Program. This program, which helped support the elephant research, focuses on novel approaches to prevention, diagnosis, and improving the value of pediatric cancer care. Additional information on Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey and the Ringling Bros. Center for Elephant Conservation , the partnership and information on how families can donate to the research can be found online at www.ringling.com and www.ringlingelephantcenter.com .

About Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) is one of the world’s top academic research and cancer treatment centers. HCI manages the Utah Population Database - the largest genetic database in the world, with more than 16 million records linked to genealogies, health records, and vital statistics. Using this data, HCI researchers have identified several cancer-causing genes, including the genes responsible for melanoma, colon and breast cancer, and paraganglioma. HCI is a member of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (a 26-member alliance of the world's leading cancer centers) and is a National Cancer Institute-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center . HCI treats patients with all forms of cancer and operates several high-risk clinics that focus on melanoma and breast, colon, and pancreas cancers.
