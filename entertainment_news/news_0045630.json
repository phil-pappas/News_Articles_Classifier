Knightley’s Broadway debut was interrupted Thursday, Oct. 1, 2015, when a member of the audience shouted at the actress and threw a bouquet of flowers at the stage before being escorted from the theater. Knightley, who plays the title character in the play “Thérèse Raquin” was onstage with Gabriel Ebert when the disturbance took place at the Studio 54 Theatre, the same location where last year actor Shia LaBeouf was handcuffed during a performance of “Cabaret” for yelling obscenities.
