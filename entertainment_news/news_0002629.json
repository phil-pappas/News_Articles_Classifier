Before Nicholas put down a walker who used to be his friend, Glenn assured him that he's a better person today than he was then.\nBefore long, the pair were surrounded by a herd of walkers from every direction, and the men climbed on top of a dumpster to try to escape the zombies' reach. But as he had done a few times through the episode, Nicholas started to zone out and then said \"Thank you\" to Glenn before shooting himself in the head, sending the two of them tumbling into the swarming walkers.\nRead More Glenn, a fan favorite since the beginning of the show, appeared to be eaten alive by the walkers in one of the most shocking scenes in the history of \"The Walking Dead.\"\nThe episode ended with Rick fending off \"Wolves\" and then walkers in an RV.\nFans registered their outrage at the turn of events on social media (and in the case of Instagram, the trending topic #ripglenn spoiled the twist), with some calling for showrunner Scott Gimple to apologize or be fired for the episode.\nMe. Right now. \"I just wanna know why! I just wanna hit somebody until they feel as bad as I do!\" #TheWalkingDead pic.twitter.com/yax79Y1Ia8\n— Marcellas Reynolds (@MarqueeMarc) October 26, 2015 90 minute #TheWalkingDead next week better just be an hour and a half of Scott Gimple apologizing to us for what he did.\n— Hotline Bling (@kyle_conrad) October 26, 2015 #TheWalkingDead fans for the next couple of weeks pic.twitter.com/4Aq6vwnfG3\n— Soutrik (@SoutrikDebnath) October 26, 2015 Someone fire Scott Gimple.\n— Brayden McCaleb (@brayden_mccaleb) October 26, 2015 Gimple released a statement during \"The Talking Dead\" that (along with Glenn's exclusion from the weekly \"in memoriam\" segment) gave credence to theories that somehow Glenn wasn't really dead.\nIt read, \"Dear fans of The Walking Dead, this is a hard story to tell and when we were planning to tell we knew our friends at the Talking Dead would be talking to you about it and knowing you'd all be talking, and feeling and commiserating, I knew we should say something about it lest our silence say something we didn't mean to say or not say.\n\"So I'll say this: In some way, we will see Glenn, some version of Glenn or parts of Glenn again, either in flashback or in the current story to help complete the story.\"\nOnly time will tell if the character is indeed really dead.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kyle_conrad/status/658478167544459264", "https://twitter.com/brayden_mccaleb/status/658463332194631680", "https://twitter.com/SoutrikDebnath/status/658542376013529088", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheWalkingDead?src=hash", "https://t.co/yax79Y1Ia8", "https://twitter.com/MarqueeMarc/status/658544027139198976", "https://t.co/4Aq6vwnfG3", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/walking-dead-glenn-dead-producers-834509"], "published": "2015-10-26T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T17:36:30.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
