They had to come check it out for themselves.” \nMarziparo said that he and lead artist Shey Haf-Ded became friends soon after Haf-Ded’s arrival on the Grand Strand more than seven years ago – and that his friendship with co-owner Taylor J. Burt goes back for almost a decade as well. \n“We were kind of riding on the same ideas a lot of the time and knew that it could work – so we gave it a try for sure,” he said. \nIndeed, Haf-Ded envisions Red Raven as a catch-all for all art. \n“We are not limiting ourselves to any one specific art form – hence the name ‘art company,’” he said, adding that he and Marziparo talked about this concept many times over the years. \n“For us, the shop is really a kind of creative child – an environment that we feel is productive and is an inviting setting for all ages.” \nHaf-Ded is known for realism in his tattoos – and he has a painting on display as well. He contends that canvas and skin, to him, are one and the same. \n“We are really trying to approach something that haven’t had here in Myrtle Beach – a little more of an artistic element and a little less of the in-your-face tattoo element or the stigmas that might come with it,” he said. \n“Even in tattoo form, it’s art first,” said Burt, adding that this is why the word “tattoo” is not a part of the company’s name. \n“It is a place where everyone can feel comfortable, but not intimidated.” \nDon’t expect to hear heavy metal blasting out the lobby either because, much like the clichéd biker stereotypes, the paradigm has shifted according to Burt, especially at Red Raven. \n“The people getting tattooed now are families, doctors and bankers.” \nBurt is all about the integration of art and a gathering spot for the community – especially on the Grand Strand, which could be construed as an underserved area in terms of culture. \n“[Myrtle Beach] has some of the most amazing talent anywhere, and they have nowhere to showcase their talent because some of the other places that do showcases are very conservative and they don’t push the boundaries. Now they have a place,” he said. \nBurt’s entrepreneurial spirit comes into play in this equation as well. \n“I am the operational partner,” he said. “I am here full time every day – making sure everything runs right. We invite everyone to come and see the art and experience the art culture that is going on here. You don’t have to come for tattoos, but come check the place out. There is something here for everyone, tattoos or not.” Related content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T18:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:10:28.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
