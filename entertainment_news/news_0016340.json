Jane Witherspoon reports ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript \nRapper Example making his film debut in his undies!o The music star is swapping the stage for the big screen in Between Two Worlds - a modern day love story in which he plays a successful city trader. \"You know cinema for me always feels like something you go to for escapism, like to try and live this weird dream ideal that they present. It feels like you might know these characters. You know where they live, you know where they go to party. You know, you know their lives so I think it's quite relatable in that sense.\" Known for hits such as \"Stay Awake\", \"Say Nothing and \"Whisky Story\" the London born star says he's not giving up on music for acting. \"No not at all. But I just shot two other films in the last month, a short and another feature and I've got two films next … one in Jan (January) and one in March but I'm not taking on big roles yet. I mean I'm probably not being offered them. But I just want to do interesting characters and because my schedule of music is quite busy I've already got like 80 gigs booked next year. \"Between Two Worlds\" is released in the UK on Friday.
