Through performance and sound design, each artist displays the extensive vocabulary found within this exciting new instrument.\nWatch the video here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCJacEzcU7A\nThe Mother-32 module is mounted in a black, laser-etched extruded aluminum enclosure and finished with traditional wood sidepieces. This 100% analog instrument features a one knob per-function interface, comprehensive voltage-controlled sequencer and an extensive 32-point analog patchbay.\nMother-32’s semi-modular design means that no patching is required to create powerful analog sound. This allows musicians of any experience level to quickly begin making music. Synthesists will enjoy exploring the extensive 32-point patchbay, which unlocks truly expressive, unique and complex synthesis capabilities. The patchbay also provides access to a wealth of sounds and functionality including an assignable CV output jack, MIDI to CV conversion, external audio input, a second voltage-controlled mixer, sync, and multiple unit expandability.\nOnboard sound sources include a powerful 10-octave analog oscillator with variable pulse width, and an analog white noise generator. The signals from each sound source are then blended together by a voltage-controlled mixer for dynamic sound creation and manipulation. From the mixer, sound travels through a Moog Ladder Filter with selectable low pass and high pass filter types.\nMusical creation and programming is executed via Mother-32’s comprehensive 32-step, voltage controlled sequencer or external MIDI controller. There are two sequencing styles available, allowing each user to quickly create new musical ideas with ease and familiarity. A total of 64 patterns can be stored and recalled from within Mother-32’s memory bank.\nMother-32 is an expandable analog ecosystem that allows multiple units to easily be mounted and patched together for extended synthesis capabilities. Units are shipping to authorized dealers worldwide now.\nOptional Mother Accessories\n6” Moog Patch Cables (5-Pack) 12” Moog Patch Cables (5-Pack) 2 Tier Mother Rack Kit (Also for use with 60 HP Moog case) 3 Tier Mother Rack Kit (Also for use with 60 HP Moog case) 60 HP Empty Moog Eurorack Case (Requires Eurorack power module for use) Mother-32 Soft Carrying Case\nLINKS\nMother-32 product page: http://www.moogmusic.com/Mother-32 Introducing Mother-32 Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCJacEzcU7A Moog Music website: http://www.moogmusic.com/ Moog Music on Twitter: http://www.Twitter.com/MoogMusicInc/ Moog Music on Facebook: http://www.Facebook.com/MoogMusicInc/\nAbout Moog Music:\nMoog Music synthesizers and other electronic musical instruments are designed and lovingly handcrafted in the Moog factory in downtown Asheville, N.C.
