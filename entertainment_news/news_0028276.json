With the low-key magical realist mood heightened by a live score composed and performed by David Paul Jones and harpist Mary Macmaster, who also prove themselves to be adept performers, The Devil's Larder proves to be a feast for the senses, however deranged they may be.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-23T07:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T11:46:14.379+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
