(AP) - Federal prosecutors say a Maryland man who offered national-security commentary on Fox News has been charged with fraud for falsely claiming a CIA career.\nAuthorities say they arrested 62-year-old Wayne Simmons of Annapolis on Thursday and charged him with fraud against the U.S. and making false statements to the government.\nAn indictment states Simmons lied about having a 27-year career with the CIA as an \"Outside Paramilitary Special Operations\" officer. The indictment alleges that Simmons made the claim as he sought security clearances and in seeking work as a defense contractor.\nAs recently as April, Simmons was identified on air on Fox radio as a \"Fox News contributor.\" In a 2009 Fox News clip, he calls House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi \"a pathological liar\" in a segment about CIA interrogation techniques.\nA Fox News spokeswoman, Carly Shanahan, said Simmons was never more than a guest on the network and that the reference to him on air as \"Fox News contributor\" was an error. \"He was never a paid commentator,\" she said.\nAt an initial appearance Thursday in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Simmons was ordered held pending a detention hearing Friday. No lawyer has yet entered an appearance on his behalf.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
