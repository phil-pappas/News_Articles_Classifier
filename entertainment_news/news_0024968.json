Jposttv Zerhom, who was mistaken for a shooter, died from gunshot wounds and injuries sustained in a mob attack. Previous Next Enlarge An Eritrean immigrant who was mistaken for a militant in an attack at an Israeli bus station died Sunday after a security guard shot him and a mob of bystanders ravaged him, officials said.\nThe death of Haptom Zerhom, said to be in his late 20s, spiked tensions even higher in the area following the shooting, which was one of the bloodiest attacks in Israel’s renewed wave of violence.\n“It’s terrible,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon said.\n“It shows you what a terrible situation we are in.”\nThe actual assailant, Mohannad al-Okbi, was also shot and killed in the attack, officials said. The 21-year-old Arab citizen, who lived in the Israeli town of Hura, appears to have no record of terrorist activity.\nHe opened fire in the central bus station of Beersheba, killing a 19-year-old Israeli soldier and wounding nine people, police said.\nAuthorities on the scene initially believed there to be two shooters. Security footage leaked online shows Zerhom crawling on the ground as clusters of people flee from the station. A security guard then runs up to him and opens fire, leaving him in a pool of blood as other guards surround his body. It does not show the subsequent mob attack.\nZerhom was rushed to a hospital, where he died from gunshot wounds and injuries from the assault, officials said.\nSome local media outlets were quick to accuse the guards of racial profiling in the accidental shooting, with the newspaper Yediot Ahronot declaring in a headline he was killing “because of his skin color.”\nDudu Grunshpan/AP Haptom Zerhom on a stretcher after the attacks that led to his death. Police said they plan to track down and arrest the Israeli civilians who attacked Zerhom as he lay dying.\nOne of them, identifying himself on as Dudu, told Israeli Army Radio he regretted mobbing the innocent immigrant.\n“If I would have known he wasn't a terrorist, believe me, I would have protected him like I protect myself,” he said.\nZerhom was in Beersheba to renew his Israeli visa, his employer told the radio station.\nDUDU GRUNSHPAN/REUTERS The actual assailant in the shooting killed a teenager Israeli soldier and wounded nine others.

Since the Jewish New Year last month, at least nine Israelis have been murdered in such attacks, and at least 27 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire.\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio urged peace between Jewish and Arab families during his visit to the country, which ended Sunday night. U.S. officials said Sunday that Secretary of State John Kerry will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas to try easing tensions.\nWith News Wire Services\njsilverstein@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories Man stabbed at Israel Ikea as wave of violence kills 3 Palestinians carry out 3 stabbings in Israel", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/HOxWdvehEk8"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:18:21.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
