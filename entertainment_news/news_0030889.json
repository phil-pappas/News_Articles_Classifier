Trouble is, those hunger pangs tend to come at a time when you’re busy, so you’re likely to absentmindedly reach for something quick, which often translates to something high in sugar and calories.\nThe key to keeping those mid-morning growls at bay is to start the day with a smart breakfast , one that will sustain you until lunchtime. Many breakfast cereals, especially those that are sweetened or made with puffed grains like rice or corn, simply aren’t filling enough to get you through the first half of your day.\nAnd if you skip breakfast? Forget it. You’ll be running on fumes way before lunchtime. Not only that, but you’ll miss out on a key source of fiber and vitamins that are commonly found in breakfast foods. According to the International Food Information Council, eating breakfast may boost alertness and concentration, and help reduce cholesterol. The IFIC also notes that eating whole-grain cereal with low-fat milk to start the day can help regulate insulin and digestion.\nWant to maximize the benefits of that morning meal? Then think oatmeal. Here’s the deal: Oats have plenty of fiber (about 4 grams in each 1/2 cup uncooked serving) plus about 6 grams of protein. Not only will oatmeal help you feel fuller longer, but it has heart-health benefits as well. According to the Mayo Clinic, 3 grams of soluble fiber per day, the amount found in one bowl of oatmeal, can reduce the absorption of cholesterol in the bloodstream. ( Click here to learn about the differences between soluble and insoluble fiber and how much total fiber you need.) <pagebreak>\nKnow Your Oats\nThere are four different kinds of oatmeal, which each undergoes different levels of processing:\nInstant oatmeal is typically packaged in envelopes with sweeteners, flavorings and other additives. It takes almost no cook time, just the addition of hot water. This is the most processed oatmeal and tends to have more calories (due to added sugars) per serving than unprocessed oatmeal. It also tends to be lower in fiber.\nQuick oats are processed to remove the outer bran for faster cooking. Less processed than instant oatmeal, these take minimal cook time (between 1 and 5 minutes).\nOld-fashioned or \"thick\" oats are steamed and rolled flat. These oats take about 10-12 minutes to cook on the stovetop. They're higher in fiber and slightly less processed than quick oats.\nSteel-cut or \"Irish\" oats are minimally processed and retain all the inherent fiber and vitamins of whole oats, but take longer (about 25 minutes) to cook. Unlike the flat oats or instant oats you're probably used to seeing, steel-cut oats are round in shape.\nWhenever possible, stick to the old-fashioned or steel-cut oats for nutrition’s sake—and know that old-fashioned oats require little to no more cooking time than the quick variety. Quick, old-fashioned, and steel-cut oats all allow you to create your own flavor combinations and control what goes into your bowl.\nIf you're used to opening a packet to \"make\" your oatmeal, you'll need to learn the basics of cooking oats. But don't worry. It's easy!\nPrep Basics for Oatmeal\nCooking oatmeal is simple: Cook oats in water at a ratio of 1:2 (1/2 cup of old-fashioned oats, 1 cup of water). Add a tiny pinch of salt (unless you’re on a low-sodium diet) to enhance oatmeal’s toasty flavor. Put everything in a small saucepan, bring to a boil and cook for 4 minutes, or until the consistency suits you (less time for “soupier” oatmeal, more time for firmer). If you have an extra minute, then try this to enhance the flavor: Place 1/2 cup oats into a dry saucepan, and toast the oats over medium heat. Then add the water and salt.\nSteel-cut oats take longer to cook, because they’re not rolled thin and they retain their intact hulls. But they have a wonderful nutty flavor and toothy texture that makes for an especially hearty breakfast. You can reduce cooking time by soaking the oats in water (in the refrigerator) overnight. Some people prefer using the microwave to prepare Irish oatmeal. As a time-saver, you can prepare a big batch on the weekend and refrigerate the oatmeal to use during the week.

And what better way to wake up than to the smell of cinnamon and brown sugar? Simply dump all the ingredients in the pot before bedtime, and you’ll wake to a hearty breakfast. Here’s a great recipe . <pagebreak>\nEuropeans have made oats a centerpiece of their morning meal for generations, notably in the fruit-oat-milk mix called muesli. The idea is simple: stir together oats and milk, add a bit of sugar, cinnamon and fruit, let sit overnight in the refrigerator, and you have a hearty, delicious (and no-cook!) starter. Follow this basic recipe ; feel free to add chopped apple, fresh or frozen blueberries, sliced banana or dried fruit.\nIf you like cold cereal and milk, consider adding oatmeal’s healthy benefits to your bowl: Swap 1/4 cup of your regular breakfast cereal for an equal amount of old-fashioned oats. You’ll gain a bit of filling fiber, which just may help you make it through your morning.\nCreative Oatmeal Combinations\nA bowl of oatmeal, warm and hearty though it is, isn’t all that exciting by itself.
