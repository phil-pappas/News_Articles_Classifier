(Joel Ryan/AP) \nGlastonbury co-organiser Emily Eavis said: “The plight of refugees who have left their homes due to fear and aggression has moved everyone in the Glastonbury Festival team and we want to do something to help. \n“We hope this auction will raise many thousands of pounds so that Oxfam, which has been a trusted partner of Glastonbury for many years, can deliver the support these people so desperately need.” \nAfter this year’s festival, more than 500 pairs of discarded wellington boots, 2,000 unused ponchos and some first aid kits were donated to migrants in Calais.
