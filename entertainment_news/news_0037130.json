I did IVF. One at a time. It isn't twins. I can see the damn thing. Get out of my uterus! Please stop. I put one embryo in. I have ultrasounds every few days. I didn't announce at a week.\" \nChrissy and her husband John Legend, whom she married in 2013, couldn't be happier to be starting a family and the brunette beauty is looking forward to \"all the belly touching.\" \nShe said: \"John and I are so happy to announce that we are pregnant. As many of you know, we've been trying to have a baby for a while now. It hasn't been easy, but we kept trying because we can't wait to bring our first child into the world and grow our family. We're so excited that it's finally happening. Thank you for all your love and well wishes.\" \nThe happy news comes just a few weeks after Chrissy was reduced to tears when she opened up about her struggles to get pregnant on her new talk show 'The FABLife'. \nAnd, although she found it tough revealing her heartache to the world, she admitted she's wanted to speak out about her problems and use of IVF for a while now. \nShe said: \"I just wanted to talk about it for so long ... It didn't feel right to tweet, 'Ugh, doing my IVF shots again.'\" bang showbiz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:20:39.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
