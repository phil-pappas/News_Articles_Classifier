More’s the pity, because Ready For This, which follows a group of teenagers who arrive in Sydney to pursue a range of dreams, is simply a great series that would undoubtedly attract an older audience if they were exposed to it, so consider yourself exposed and get on board. This week the drama is very real when Levi (Aaron McGrath) learns that Reece (Christian Byers) has been spending his nights in the school gym, visits the home he’s supposed to have and learns why a gym’s a better option. There’s also a visit by Dylan’s dad, which doesn’t quite end as he hoped, a bit of biff between Lily and Zoe and a surprise cameo by Richard Tognetti, but it’s Levi and Reece who shine through with a believable and affecting look at why some kids choose to sleep rough and how friendships, even the most unlikely ones, can make aworld of difference.\nRise of the Machines, SBS, 9.30pm \nAdvertisement Yes, yes, we’ve heard all the ‘‘Hangon! This isn’t the Terminator movie!’’ jokes, so moving on, what is this? It’s a look at how we humans build and use machines, inparticular big ones, with a giant ship ‘‘with an engine the size of a house’’ under the spotlight. If you’re into this kind of mechanical documentary series, you’ll undoubtedly find fascinating the analysis of how the Treasure (that’s the big ship) was built and how it moves an oil rig into position. If not, it’s all a bit like watching someone play with Meccano while ominous music pounds.\nGreys Anatomy, Seven, 10pm \nIs this series still going? Yes, like some patient the medicos have managed to bring back from a life-threatening malaise, it is, and surprisingly, there’s still life left. Dr Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) is now the new chief of surgery, so the focus is moving more on to her and how she makes the transition from one of the gang to telling them what to do. Predictably there are hiccups – Dr Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), for one, doesn’t seem to be able to say no to her new boss, leading to a log jam in the OR – but maybe a shake-up is what she and Grey Sloan Memorial need as much as the series did.\nScott Ellis", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T12:11:41.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
