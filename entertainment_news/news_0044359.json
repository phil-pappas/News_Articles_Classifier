I came from a place where love was hard to find but, I found it through a pen,” Davis said. “This book is about “us” our everyday surviving or way of living—surviving, living and understanding what you’re up against.”\nPublished by New York City-based Page Publishing, Davis’s poignant tale outlines a life on the streets.\nReaders who wish to experience this gripping work can purchase “Shattered Dreams” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708.\nAbout Page Publishing\nPage Publishing is a traditional New York based full-service publishing house that handles all of the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
