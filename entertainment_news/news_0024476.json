County officials want to spend $761,600 to hire a firm to conduct a top-to-bottom review of public safety expenditures and practices. STAN LIM, FILE PHOTO Related article » PUBLIC SAFETY REVIEW A contract before the Riverside County Board of Supervisors would pay KPMG $761,600 for a comprehensive review of public safety spending and practices.\nWho is KPMG? Part of an international network of companies that provide auditing, tax and advisory services to the public sector and private industry, according to the company's website. KPMG's U.S offices include locations in Los Angeles and Orange County.\nWhy Them? \"The KPMG staff has extensive experience in national security, law enforcement and working with justice agencies to be more efficient and proactive,\" according to a county staff report.\nRiverside County is poised to spend $761,600 on a top-to-bottom review of public safety spending to ensure that the biggest part of the county’s budget is being spent wisely.\nOn Tuesday, Oct. 6, the Board of Supervisors will consider a contract with the auditing firm KPMG to review the spending and practices of the Sheriff’s Department, district attorney, public defender and probation department. The Fire Department is the subject of a separate review.\nThe goal, according to the county executive office, is see whether the county is getting the most out of its public safety dollars. Also to be examined are the rates cities pay to hire sheriff’s deputies for police protection.\nThe review comes amid increased scrutiny of public safety, which accounts for two-thirds of the county’s discretionary spending. That percentage could grow in the next few years, worrying officials who also have to pay for animal control, social services and other public needs that are struggling to find money even as the county’s economy rebounds.\nRELATED: 13 cities study creating new joint police department\nLast fiscal year, the county spent just under $476 million in discretionary money on public protection, budget records show. In fiscal year 2015-16, that number is expected to be $499.8 million, an increase of 5 percent.\nCities have warned they’re having a hard time affording the increasing sheriff’s contract rates. Sheriff Stan Sniff blames the rate hikes on raises guaranteed to labor unions by the five supervisors.\nAdding to the budget crunch is realignment -- the shifting of responsibility for low-level offenders from the state to counties -- and Prop. 47, which re-classified a number of non-violent crimes as misdemeanors.\nAs a result, jails have inmates with chronic health needs serving multi-year sentences. The Probation Department oversees more sophisticated offenders, and the public defender and DA have been swamped with requests from inmates seeking to reduce their felony convictions to misdemeanors.\nSniff, an elected official, has expressed concerns about the upcoming review. He said his department is regularly audited and that a review could expose sensitive information that could be used against the county, perhaps in a lawsuit.\nSupervisors and County Executive Officer Jay Orr have countered that the county needs to have a better understanding of public safety spending and whether practices can be changed to protect the public more effectively and efficiently. Earlier this year, the board moved ahead with a plan to hire an outside firm to conduct the review.\nThe contract with KPMG would be paid for with money from a special public safety sales tax. The county picked KPMG from among five bids for the review, according to a county staff report.\nKPMG is expected to finish the review by Jan. 31, 2016, the report read.\nContact the writer: 951-368-9547 or jhorseman@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvmbmf-b88529654z.120151002171826000gb0cbkh3.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvmbmf-b88529654z.120151002171826000gb0cbkh3.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T08:07:45.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
