However, after the killing of Kannada writer and rationalist M M Kalburgi in August, she approached police.\n\nKalburgi was shot dead by two men at his residence at Dharwad in north Karnataka, with the assassins still remaining elusive.\n\n\"Chethana has been receiving the threat messages from the past one year but did not take them seriously. She approached us following Kalburgi's killing,\" Kumar said. Hanumanthnagar police are investigating the case, he said.\n\nKalburgi's murder followed by the Dadri lynching incident involving a Muslim over beef-eating rumours has triggered protests by writers, with several of them announcing returning their Sahitya Akademi awards to protest \"rising intolerance\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:02:02.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
