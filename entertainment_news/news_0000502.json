Friday to Oct. 18. \nWHERE: Players Guild of Leonia, Civil War Drill Hall Theater, 130 Grand Avenue, Leonia. 201 947-9606 or leoniaplayers.org. \nHOW MUCH: $20; students and seniors $18. \nInvisibility is fun, for superheroes. It’s not so great for actors. \nInvisible baseballs, invisible coffee cups, invisible plates and knives and spoons, are just some of the props that actors are working with — or to be more precise, non-props that actors are not working with — in the classic 1938 drama \"Our Town,\" presented Friday to Oct. 18 by the Players Guild of Leonia. \n\"It takes a lot of concentration,\" says Teaneck’s Carol Fisher, director of the production. \"You have to know what you’re doing every moment. You can’t fake it.\" \nThe lack of props and sets was specified by playwright Thornton Wilder, who didn’t want the bare-bones honesty of his portrait of a small New Hampshire town, at the turn of the 20th century, to be compromised by distracting backdrops and a clutter of stage objects. \nPhotos of the very first production, at Princeton’s McCarter Theatre, show the theater’s radiators, clearly visible, where the scenery would normally be hung. \"Our hope, our despair are in the mind — not in things, not in ‘scenery,’ \" Wilder wrote. \nBut try telling that to an actor who has to pour coffee from a non-existent kettle into a non-existent cup. \n\"It’s difficult,\" Fisher says. \"Some of the actors are very good at pantomime, and some of them really had to work hard. They forget sometimes. Maybe [an actor] is cooking, holding a spatula, and she walks over and she’ll forget the spatula is in her hand. She doesn’t put it down. Or people will be talking, pouring coffee into a cup, and they won’t be looking at the cup, they’re looking at the person they’re talking to.\" \nThe result, of course, is that invisible coffee is spilling all over the table. \"Even if you’re good at pantomime, there’s things you don’t realize,\" Fisher says. \"We’re putting in a lot of time, trying to get it right.\" \nThese days, when \"Our Town\" is a staple of both professional and community theater, it’s easy to misremember Wilder’s play as cracker-barrel Americana, a big Norman Rockwell celebration of small-town life in an era when no one locked their doors, where boy (Gabriel Borges of Cliffside Park) and girl (Anna Paone of New York) meet at the soda fountain, and a kindly, folksy narrator, the \"stage manager\" (Owen Sheridan of Leonia) can’t hardly talk a spell without pepperin’ his speech with \"yonders\" and \"s’far as we knows.\" \nMany productions of \"Our Town,\" over the years, have veered toward the mawkish — most notoriously a 1955 TV musical version in which Frank Sinatra, a most un-Yankee New Englander, chirped the song \"Love and Marriage\" (later the sardonic theme song of \"Married. . . With Children.\") Even the otherwise excellent 1940 film version, with its memorable Aaron Copland score, felt compelled to give the story a Hollywood \"happy ending.\" \nBut in the original \"Our Town,\" the homespun details of the first two acts are just the setup for the devastating third, in which — spoiler alert — some of the major characters, now dead, address us from beyond the grave. Where Wilder, in the earlier scenes, uses a close-angle lens to view the mundane features of life in Grover’s Corners, in the final moments he suddenly widens the iris to a cosmic scale — making us understand that even the most prosaic things are miraculous, when viewed in the light of life itself being a miracle. \nThat is what Fisher, directing a cast of 24, hopes her audience leaves with. \n\"Hopefully, everybody will realize that in their own lives,\" she says. \"We run through our lives, we go from here to there, we don’t even remember how we got to work. We don’t remember the day at all. Was it a pretty day? Was it an ugly day? What did the sky look like? Were there people walking by? What did they look like?\" \nFisher, a nurse in her civilian career (she’s also directed many productions at Players Guild, including \"All My Sons,\" \"The Trip to Bountiful\" and \"You’re a Good Man, Charlie Brown\") is in the business of helping to save lives. \"Our Town\" does that too, in a way. \n\"I would hope that, after the show, the audience would go outside, and look up at the stars,\" she says. \nEmail: beckerman@northjersey.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:22:04.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
