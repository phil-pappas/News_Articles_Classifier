So, with that in mind, we've compiled eleven Irish localities and tied them with an equivalent from America. Some of these were surprisingly on point.\n11. GALWAY = SAN FRANCISCO\nWeird, arty people everywhere. Big music / culture scene. Rents are sky high. Everyone wants to go there, but nobody's really sure they want to live there. It's almost as if San Francisco broke off from itself in an abstract art-piece performance and then drifted towards the West Coast of Ireland.\n10. LAOIS = DELAWARE\nImagine being able to be magically whisked away to... Laois / Delaware. Hi. I'm in Laois / Delaware.\n9. DUBLIN = NEW YORK\nFull of themselves, think it's the centre of the universe, impossible to live anywhere in the city centre. OF COURSE Dublin is New York. We'll also subdivide the city with the North Side being Queen's and the South Side being Manhattan's Upper East Side. Howth is the yellow pack version of The Hamptons.\n8. KILKENNY = LAS VEGAS\nWhat happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. So to what happens in Kilkenny, stays in Kilkenny. You start in Langtons or Matt The Millers, the rest becomes a blur and then, somehow, you're deposited back at a Centra Deli in the early hours of the morning with a marriage licence.\n7. TRAMORE = FLORIDA\nThe final destination for retired people before shuffling off the mortal coil, we're fully convinced if the climate was actually a little bit balmier, crocodiles would flourish in Tramore.\n6. MULLINGAR = MEMPHIS\nMemphis is where some of music's finest got their start. Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison, Aretha Franklin, Isaac Hayes and all the way up to Justin Timberlake. So to has Mullingar produced some musical notables including Bressie, Niall Horan and, of course, Joe Dolan. He's our nation's Elvis and the Joe Dolan Bridge is our Graceland.\n5. KERRY = ALABAMA\nHome to beautiful, stunning scenery, wondrous wildlife and some crazy-ass politicians. We're also pretty sure Alabama has a notorious problem with potholes, too.\n4. DONEGAL = ALASKA\nIt's all the way up in the North West, freezing its collective nuts off while, y'know, just being there. Much like Alaskans, Donegal people are made of sturdier stuff than your average. It's all the cold, you see.\n3. CORK = TEXAS\nFiercely proud of being from Cork / Texas, there's that constant fear that they'll eventually split away from the rest of us and form their own independent country. If they had their way, Corkonians / Texans would build a wall across the border and man with it with Roy Keane / Chuck Norris clones to keep out the non-natives. In our case, it's anyone not from Cork.\n2. KILDARE = CONNECTICUT\nThey've moved away from the big city and now they're enjoying the fact that they can lord it over anyone still there. It's all leafy suburbs, SUVs, GAA / Soccer Moms, 2.4 children and severely repressed anger issues.\n1. LIMERICK = DETROIT\nLike Detroit, Limerick's produced some of our nation's finest musicians, including Aphex Twin, Horslips, The Cranberries and, of course, The Rubberbandits. It also was a major manufacturing hub with Ford Motors in Detroit and Dell in Limerick. And so to, they've become the national joke for crime in urban areas. Because there's nothing original under the sun, folks.\nMORE: Orange weather warning set to ruin all of our weekends\nMORE: FYI, Miles Teller (and his granny) are in Ireland right now\nMORE: Irish Rail are hoping to find a young passenger to pass on this touching message", "external_links": ["http://media.giphy.com/media/HFe6OYbJ8mLKM/giphy.gif", "https://media.giphy.com/media/EV0cGckwbnRG8/giphy.gif", "https://38.media.tumblr.com/b586a933f941b154fc102a90bb48413e/tumblr_nsbrb27gjL1uxt55go1_500.gif", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/5h0ia0Oz4l4", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/HPmLCoYTdBI", "https://animatedmeta.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/inside-out-anger-pizza-ruined.gif", "http://i.imgur.com/rSNJH.gif", "http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8cxabUAra1qag1wuo4_500.gif"], "published": "2015-10-01T22:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:43:03.331+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
