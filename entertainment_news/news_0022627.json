You know, you’re just playing the call.\"\nWith just nine sacks this year, including six by the front line, those players have come under a little fire because Williams and Dareus are the two highest-paid players on the team. \"They pay us a lot of money,” Dareus said. “We want to use our talents to the best way that we know how. If we’re going to be dropping, we don’t want to get questions about why we’re not getting sacks, and that’s simply it. We want to make some plays. We don’t want fans to look at us crazy. Shoot, we like making plays.\"\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nPostcards from London: You're going the wrong way!\nTweets by @salmaiorana Even Hall of Fame quarterback Jim Kelly was wondering aloud about the defensive scheme. At the same Play 60 event Tuesday, Kelly said, “Dropping Mario Williams into coverage a lot? Didn’t we pay him a lot of money to hit the quarterback? If I’m the opposing quarterback and I see him dropping into coverage – and Jerry Hughes – oh, that’s a big plus. I would definitely have a big smile on my face.”\n“Dropping Mario Williams into coverage a lot? Didn’t we pay him a lot of money to hit the quarterback? If I’m the opposing quarterback and I see him dropping -into coverage -- and Jerry Hughes -- oh, that’s a big plus.”\nJim Kelly Omenyiora played nine years for the Giants, and during part of his time there, he was a member of one of the best defensive lines in the NFL, teaming with Jason Pierre-Paul and Justin Tuck. That group didn't spend much time covering backs and tight ends, they were rushing upfield trying to sack quarterbacks, and during his career, Omenyiora collected 85, including 10 with the Falcons his last two seasons in the league.\nHe watched the film of the Bengals game in preparation for his work this week with BBC, and what he saw were some perplexing calls, but also, not a great performance by the Bills' linemen.\n\"I've heard a lot of complaints about the calls, but from what I've seen, the players themselves just aren't playing as well as I've seen them play,\" Umenyiora said. \"But I get it it. I wouldn't want to be dropping into coverage that much, maybe two or three times is OK to mix your blitz packages so they don't know where you're at all the time, especially with a talented team like this.\"\nOn Wednesday, Ryan spoke to the media for the first time since his players questioned the strategy, and he did not take issue with their comments, and actually agreed, to a certain point, with their assessment.\n\"When you look at it, I get it, you get paid to rush the quarterback, but we get paid to win and what I was trying to do was get (Dalton) out of rhythm and initially it was working pretty good, but I lived in it too much,\" said Ryan. \"I don't necessarily disagree with Marcell and Mario's views. All these guys want to do is help and they want to win. If they make a comment or whatever, that's fine. Shoot, I've been cussed at by better than them, so it's fine.\"\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nTyrod Taylor practices, status for game unknown\n“I don't necessarily disagree with Marcell and Mario's views. All these guys want to do is help and they want to win. If they make a comment or whatever, that's fine. Shoot, I've been cussed at by better than them, so it's fine.”\nRex Ryan Following practice Wednesday, Williams backed off a bit from his previous stance and conceded that whatever's called, the players have to play it to the best of their ability.\n\"The head coach, the defensive coordinator, all the coaches, they have to implement what is needed and we have to go out and play ball,\" said Williams. \"I'm never down on anybody on this team or losing faith in anybody or what we do. We just have to be able to tweak it to how we play, and that's on us as players. He's a great defensive-minded coach. His philosophy and scheme has worked year in and year out, and it's just something that we have to adjust to more than what we expected as a front four. We're working on that.\"\nRyan seemed amenable to getting back to a more basic approach this week against Jacksonville and second-year quarterback Blake Bortles. The 1-5 Jaguars aren't remotely close to the Bengals in terms of talent, so turning the front four — which will include Corbin Bryant in place of injured Kyle Williams — loose is probably prudent.\n\"Should we rush more than we did this past week? That's probably true,\" said Ryan. \"I'm not perfect as a play caller, and I know that surprises you guys, but I try to do my best. If I'm going to make a mistake it's going to be something that I feel strongly about and if it doesn't work out at the end of the day, then that happens.\"\nMAIORANA@Gannett.com\nThe Bills hit the practice field in London but there were several notable players missing.
