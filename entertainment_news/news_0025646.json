In one of the scenes, Amal walks in on Hosny painting, they exchange a couple of un-sibling-like smiles before she announces, \"If only you weren't my brother, something else would have happened.\" Say whaaa? \nAnd then there was that other scene with Amal Rizk being creepy again, this time with her onscreen son Ahmed Malek. Ingy describes how Ahmed and Amal touched each other's hands from behind a glass screen, before Ahmed looked at his mum and gestured that he would \"put a ring on it.\" OK, this is beyond creepy! \nAs for Ahwak's leading man Tamer Hosny, well, Ingy says that his acting was the same old same with no new life injected in his character, joking that the only things different about him were his hairstyle and the \"candy crush-colored outfits he sported in the movie.\" \nWhen it came to Ghada Adel , Ingy was surprised and somewhat disappointed that an actress of her calibre had accepted a role like this one, stressing that her acting abilities and previous roles are way better than this. \nWe get the casting wasn't spot on, but what about the decor? Ingy said the entire film's set was a \"burst of colors,\" too much everywhere with no balance at all. \nShe also made fun of the way Tamer's house made it look as if he had woken up in Hawaii, only to find himself in the Maldives when he went downstairs to the living room! \nLast but not least was the unorganized display of the film's sponsors, which Ingy says could have been done in a much smarter and tasteful way. \nWith over 35 thousand FB followers, when it comes to criticizing movies, this funny lady's opinion must really count! \nYou can watch Ingy's critique (in Arabic) here .
