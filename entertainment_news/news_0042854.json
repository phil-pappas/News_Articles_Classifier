With that idea in mind, Mundy set out to create a runway show that celebrates vintage fashion for this year's Fashion Week of Rochester, a six-day event that kicks off Oct. 13.\nCalled Midtown Funk, the vintage fashion show Thursday night will feature emerging designers and a re-creation of the famous Ebony Fashion Fair shows that made stops in Rochester.\nChristian Dior, Yves St. Laurent, Oscar de la Renta, Pierre Cardin, Patrick Kelly, Christian Lacroix and Alexander McQueen are just a few of the designers who created couture clothing especially for Ebony Fashion Fair, which started in Chicago in 1958 and continued through the '60s, '70s, '80s and '90s. This traveling spectacular helped to redefine the concepts of beauty, style and empowerment for African American women.\nBack then, black women were not featured as models on the runway or in magazines, says Mary Nicosia, a Rochester vintage fashion collector. Ebony Fashion Fair, which was sponsored by Ebony Magazine , sought to change that, showing that black women are beautiful.\nThe Fashion Week shows explore the 50-year history of Ebony Fashion Fair, which emerged at the time of the civil rights movement, says Nicosia, who is loaning her collection of vintage gowns and jewels for the event.\nAt a recent fitting, Nicosia worked her magic on models ready to strut the runway. She fitted her burgundy evening gown loaded with feathers on the model and accessorized the dress with matching costume jewelry. The look evokes the elegance of years past.\nBuy Photo Mary Z.

Thursday's Fashion Week event will show projected images of the exhibition with models on the runway donning fashion from local designers and vintage couture from local collectors. While the gallery show is an exhibition, there will be an opportunity to dress up with a members-only party on Jan. 30 and a public party on Jan. 31.There will also be a gala party in April.\nThe Ebony Fashion Fair traveled to Rochester as early as 1962, says MAG spokeswoman Meg Colombo. Over the next 50 years, the traveling fashion show helped raise millions for charity and the profile of Johnson Publishing Co., publisher of Ebony and Jet magazines.\nShow organizers overcame racial prejudice to bring fashion to people eager to see a new black America. Eunice Johnson of the publishing company took over as producer and director in 1963 as the traveling show gained new audiences.\nThe traveling exhibit fits with the Memorial Art Gallery's mission of inclusiveness and culture, Colombo says.\nThere is something magical about the 1960s era, says Joan Lincoln, owner of Panache Vintage and Finer Consignments in Brighton who is also providing fashions for the Midtown Funk show.\n\"It was a time when women really dressed up,' she says.\nLincoln points to a pale pink satin dress with embroidery and a matching jacket. The look is perfect for a night on the town, she says.\nVintage fashion is making a comeback as many women seek out the classic glamour, Lincoln says. Her shop carries many styles in myriad price points.\nFrom the elegance of the 1960s, Lincoln selected contrasting looks to showcase the glitz of the 1980s. Sequins and gold reign supreme in the 1980s vintage styles.\nThis year, Fashion Week of Rochester will host its runway shows in one location under a large tent, similar to fashion weeks in larger cities. The 15,000-square-foot tent on Main Street downtown, across from the Sibley Building, will feature a nearly 100-foot raised runway, seating and standing room for more than 900 people and a retail and food vendor area.\nFashion Week 2015 kicks off Tuesday with a free Fashion Exchange at the tent, where people can trade in gently used items from their closets for something new. The week's five runway shows will start Wednesday and continue through Saturday. The annual shopping event, the Boutique Crawl, will round out the week on Sunday, Oct. 18.\nIt is the sixth year annual event, which started with just two runway shows. The show grows every year and is a major fundraiser for the Center for Youth that helps area young people in need.\nMundy and Center for Youth Executive Director Elaine Spaull lead the charge on Fashion Week productions. Each year, the event gets bigger and there are always surprises, Mundy says.\nMidtown Funk, featuring re-creations from Ebony Fashion Fair, is just one example of how Fashion Week is switching things up. Inspirations from the past keep fashion moving forward, Mundy says.\n\"There's a huge interest in vintage,\" Mundy says. \"Current designers draw their designs from vintage fashions.\"\nMCHAO@Gannett.com\nBuy Photo Kaydian Hayle, Rochester, looks over the vintage Victor Costa dress with duck feather trim as she tries on outfits in preparation for Fashion Week.
