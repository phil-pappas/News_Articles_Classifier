Through her inclusion of book introductions she wrote for other authors, we get rich glimpses into her relationships with fellow writers, sitting with them at tables as they sip beers and share life. And when we read older articles that tell of thoughts the author no longer thinks, Cisneros grants new insights. In 1987 she couldn't imagine being anything other than a writer; today, however, she provides an asterisk and divulges that she'd rather be a comedian, a shoe designer, a milliner, a henna hand painter. \nThe writer also explores poverty and wealth, often through the lens of art. Several articles are devoted to specific paintings, sculptures and exhibits. She describes the three plaster Graces in her mother's Chicago kitchen, the stained glass she gazed upon during Mass while in boarding school and a myriad of pieces created and collected by the community of artists with whom she surrounds herself today. \nThroughout each story, though written for a diverse smattering of purposes and people, is Cisneros' constant molding of words like clay, plopping us on a treeless Geneva street \"as bald as a knuckle\" and allowing us to feel the oppressive heat of Spain while she searches for live flamenco. She leads us into her closet-sized childhood bedroom with a door that won't close, describes her father's expert creativity in upholstering the family furniture and ushers us into her heart as it breaks upon his death. Cisneros' words will make existing fans love her more, and drive new readers to reach for her previous works after closing this one. \nOnline: Get all your favorite Entertainment news by following our Entertainment feed on Twitter!
