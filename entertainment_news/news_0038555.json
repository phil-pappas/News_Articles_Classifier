In her film, Tsangari, who earned critical acclaim with Attenberg, lampoons male antagonism and competitiveness. Jury president, Pawel Pawlikowski, the director of Oscar-winner Ida, described Chevalier as a \"study of male antagonism seen though the eyes of a brave and original filmmaker.\"\nPawlikowski's fellow jurors were producer Christine Vachon, actors Chiwetel Ejiofor and Kristin Scott-Thomas, and director and screenwriter Mabel Cheung. The Witch is about a 17th-century New England family torn apart by tension and the suspicion of witchcraft. Jury president, Appropriate Behavior director Desiree Akhavan, said The Witch \"stood apart as the announcement of a new voice in contemporary cinema.\" The jury also commended Martin Butler and Bentley Dean's Tanna.\nAkhavan's jury comprised director and fine artist Clio Barnard, who won the Sutherland Award in 2010 for her feature debut The Arbor, James Kent, the director of Testament of Youth, actor Allen Leech (The Imitation Game), and chief film critic of The Times, Kate Muir. Jennifer Peedom's Sherpa, which captures tragedy and mayhem on Mount Everest, won the Grierson Award for the best documentary. The jury members were filmmakers Mark Cousins and Brian Woods, Guardian head of documentaries and previous deputy director of Sheffield DocFest, Charlie Phillips, and directing duo Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard (20,000 Days on Earth).\nThe awards ceremony was hosted by musician Jarvis Cocker, and guests included Kathleen Kennedy, Martin Freeman and Ian McKellen, who presented the British Film Institute's Fellowship to Cate Blanchett.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T06:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T21:26:42.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
