He says he's \"very fortunate\" to have the pathology reports show the tumors are all non-aggressive and that there is no indication that they have spread. \nHe canceled Phil Lesh and Friends shows scheduled for Oct. 24 and 25 at the Terrapin Crossroads. \nLesh says he will be able to return to normal activities two weeks after surgery and will reschedule the canceled dates.
