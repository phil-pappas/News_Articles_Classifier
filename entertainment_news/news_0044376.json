The new incarnation’s wider scope means it is now open to those from the arts and culture sector, including arts and culture educators, arts groups, heritage non-governmental organisations, cultural policy makers, docents and members of the Museum Roundtable organisation. \nAside from the NHB, the Academy will be working with partner institutions such as the National Arts Council, The Esplanade and The Arts House. It will also link up with local and international institutions to come up with specialised undergraduate and post-graduate courses in areas such as cultural administration. \nSaid Mrs Rosa Daniel, Deputy Secretary (Culture) for MCCY: “The work of the NHB Academy over the last five years has provided a solid foundation for the launch of the Culture Academy to serve the needs of the wider cultural sector. The goal of the Academy is to stretch the imagination and consider new paths for cultural institutions in Singapore.” \nDr MacGregor’s lecture was the first from a host of international experts that the Academy is planning to invite in the coming years to strengthen its various programmes. In the pipeline are leading arts, culture and heritage voices from Australia, Hong Kong, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France and Asia. \n“The Culture Academy will be tasked to groom leaders and develop strong administrators and museum professionals across both the arts and heritage sectors. We hope that the Academy will help make Singapore a place where cultural leaders meet, exchange ideas and in so doing grow a deeper understanding of our own culture and that of Southeast Asia,” said Ms Yeoh Chee Yan, Permanent Secretary for MCCY.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T14:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T15:30:13.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
