Kochi Times chats with Michel Dias, one among the founders, about the band's unique repertoire, their impression about Kerala's music scene, and more:\nMad Orange, THE GENRE...\nThe founding members Kaushik Kumar, Sravan and I had landed in Bangalore for work and the love for music brought us together. We created a genre called Orange Rock , about four years ago, and now, have more than 25 original tracks to our credit. Mad Orange music is a blend of jazz, funk, pop and rock.\nWhile I play guitar and also double up as a vocalist for the band, Kaushik handles the base and Deepak Raghu is the drummer.\nTHE CREATIVE FIREWORKS\nWe create music that we love to listen to and they are borne out of the creative conflicts we have during our jamming sessions. We are all from different backgrounds, and the essence of it all reflects in our work as well. Our popular numbers include Shaking My Ground, Feet Ain't Moving and On the Ledge .\nThe life connect...\nEach of our songs echo a certain state of mind, and delves deep into it to capture the essence of the experience itself â€” and put it in a clearer perspective.\nThey are also metaphors of various emotions like love, failure, redemption, depression, insanity, freedom, et al. The songs are actually screenshots of what each one of us experience in our lives. I guess this is why people find it easy to connect with our music.\nThe music scene in Kerala...\nKochi is my hometown and it's great to see that it has a conducive atmosphere for new genres of music. A lot has changed in the music scenario of Kerala in the past few years. The current trend is remixing folk numbers (nadanpattu) or scoring songs in a similar style. If popularity is the aim, musicians should regionalize their music. Nevertheless, we are happy with creating our kind of songs.\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-02T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:11:57.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
