Us Weekly reported that the \" Modern Family \" actress entrusted her wedding dress to Lebanese fashion designer Zuhair Murad. Zuhair previously designed Sofia's dress for Oscar and Golden Globe parties. The 43-year-old actress looked gorgeous in some sequinned dresses designed by Zuhair in the past. For the upcoming nuptials, Sofia will wear a custom-made, fairy-tale frock. Other details about the dress haven't been revealed yet. Sofia and Joe were engaged in Hawaii in December last year. The couple will marry at Florida's Breakers resort in Palm Beach on November 22. Sofia revealed on \" Jimmy Kimmel Live! \" that they would invite 400 guests and use Colombian tradition for the wedding which means there will be no bridesmaids. In another interview, Sofia said that there would be a \"special\" cake table with \"a big wedding cake and lots of desserts.\" However, there won't be a gift table.
