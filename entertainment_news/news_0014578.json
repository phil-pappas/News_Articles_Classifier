These two don't hang out that often, at least not on Instagram, so whenever something like this happens, it feels special.\n When u & ya bestie see the girls y'all got beef with walking in the club üòÅüòò\nA photo posted by Nicki Minaj (@nickiminaj) on Oct 21, 2015 at 11:05am PDT\nMore From Cosmopolitan It is impossible to overstate how cool it is to see Nicki and Beyonc√© on stage at the same time. Even Jay Z, host and curator of the night, knew how cool it would be, because he did part of his own set before Nicki's solo turn and only returned to do \"Holy Grail\" with Beyonc√© (obviously) and \"Empire State of Mind\" (he was in Brooklyn, after all). By the time Beyonc√© materialized in a cloud of smoke, back to the audience, concertgoers had already been in the arena for more than two hours and seen Nick Jonas, Lil Wayne, Rick Ross, French Montana, Usher, T.I., Nas, Meek Mill, A$AP Ferg, and more, and still they greeted the prospect of a Bey/Nicki duet with more enthusiasm than they gave the whole first hour of the show.\nPrior to the Tidal concert, the only time Nicki and Beyonc√© had been on stage together was at the final stop of Bey and Jay's \"On the Run\" tour, when they performed their remix of the BEYONC√â track \"***Flawless.\" That too was incredible, partially because Beyonc√©, undisputed queen who \"stopped the world\" with her surprise album, doesn't invite just anybody up onstage with her. \"Ladies and gentlemen, I have me a special lady,\" she said while introducing Nicki. \"My girl. Show your love for Onika.\" Later, Beyonc√© joined Nicki Minaj on The Pinkprint for \"Feeling Myself,\" which eventually got a FOMO-inducing video. Besides that, though, their relationship is mostly limited to Instagrammed birthday wishes and occasional public outings, like their May double date to the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight.\nA photo posted by Nicki Minaj (@nickiminaj) on May 2, 2015 at 10:23pm PDT\nCompare this with Taylor Swift's squad, which is everywhere at all times: at her house in Rhode Island for the Fourth of July, on stage with her strutting the \"Style\" runway, in interviews talking about what motivates their pack mentality. These things are admirable but rarely feel realistic, especially once your squad ages out of sleepovers and homemade brunch and into full-day hangovers and full-time jobs. (My own recent attempt at a BFF sleepover ended with one of us falling asleep on the couch at 10 p.m. and the other leaving at 9 a.m. the next day because she had to go to work on the weekend.) Think about how hard it is for people with simple office jobs to schedule drinks with one person, let alone three, four, or five. Do you really believe that people juggling world tours, movie shoots, and levels of fame that require full security teams really hang out often, if at all?\nNicki and Bey, despite having lives that at times seem even more unattainable than Taylor and company's, make their celebrity friendship, however staged it is, look authentic. They see each other about as often as a regular working woman sees her friends, and they post about it only when it's really, really special. Despite the fact that their public relationship exists mostly in their performances, it is somehow less performative. There are no hollow shout-outs about the other's projects or screenshots of their text messages, no Instagrams designed solely for people to reply \"#SQUADGOALS\" in all caps. The reason for this relative reticence might be that Beyonc√© and Nicki don't actually hang out in real life, but even so, the moments where they at least look like friends always ring true. It also helps that neither seems like the type to pretend to like someone when they don't ‚Äî just ask Miley Cyrus (what's good).\nThe two of them made a combined $75.5 million in the last year , yet there they are in the \"Feeling Myself\" video, making mustaches out of their hair and throwing French fries into each other's mouths. There's Nicki, tweeting that Blue Ivy calls her by her full name. And there's Beyonc√©, the world's preeminent control freak, telling Nicki to just \"do [her] thing\" on the \"Flawless\" remix. They might never have a weekend-long slumber party together, but are any adult women doing that? Probably not. If they ever do, though, say good-bye to the Internet, because it will definitely get broken.\nWhen u and bestie know yall poppin. #FeelingMyself #FeelingMyselfVIDEOonTIDAL üëÖ\nA photo posted by Nicki Minaj (@nickiminaj) on May 18, 2015 at 2:11pm PDT\n‚ÄãFollow Eliza on Twitter .", "external_links": ["http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6206968/nicki-minaj-explains-beyonce-flawless-remix", "https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/510924523731177473", "http://www.forbes.com/profile/beyonce-knowles/", "https://instagram.com/p/2NToEdL8VE/", "http://www.forbes.com/hip-hop-cash-kings/", "http://www.twitter.com/thompsonplaid", "https://instagram.com/p/7Ow5wdL8dv/", "https://instagram.com/p/9G-ryJr8ZK/", "https://instagram.com/p/21oCgZr8YU/"], "published": "2015-10-23T23:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:15:54.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
