With Halloween on the way, thoughts turn to what to wear and who to be.\nAlthough local costume stores have just begun to see increased traffic as those looking to play dress-up come Oct. 31 explore ideas and begin to piece them together, some trends are already shaping up.\n\"We do get requests for witch doctors, voodoo priestesses — that Marie Laveau look,\" said costumer Dennis Villadeleon, who works at the Southern Costume Company on Lafayette Street. \"There's always someone in for that look every year. It's just popular.\"\nRenee Ainsworth, a sales associate at Miss Claudia's Vintage Clothing and Costumes on Magazine Street, said that shop also sees a steady stream of voodoo requests.\n\"But a lot of our 'Day of the Dead' stuff, too,\" she said, noting something that seems hot in 2015. \"Day of the Dead is real big.\"\nCasting a wider scope, a National Retail Federation survey indicates big Halloween trends for adults this year include \"Star Wars\" characters, witches, zombies and \"Batman\" characters.\nIf you're also looking for new inspiration, check out the photo gallery above. It pulls in more than 50 ideas from the NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune archives, from ghastly ghouls to groovy chicks and costumed attendees partying on Mardi Gras to those rocking out at the Voodoo Experience , which, in 2015, is Oct. 30 through Nov. 1 in City Park.\nFor most, Halloween tends toward the scarier looks — drawing on the undead or mystical creatures — but there is some split between men and women.\n\"What I wish I saw more of was people wanting to look really scary,\" Villadeleon said. \"The guys are all for it, but the girls, they don't want to do scary stuff. They always tell me they don't want to be ugly.\"\nHis favorite so far this year? A couple asking for help to become Medusa and Perseus.\n\"That,\" he said, \"is a good one.\"\nSHOPPING GUIDE\nSouthern Costume Company, 951 Lafayette St., 504.523.4333. Good for: Costume rental.
