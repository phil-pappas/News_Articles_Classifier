We are making good films and they are getting appreciated worldwide especially at film festivals. It's not necessary to do a Hollywood film to prove one's skills as an actor.\n\"I don't think I need to do Hollywood films. If I get an opportunity, I will consider it. But it's not any do or die situation,\" Nawazuddin, who will be seen in the Hollywood project \"Lion\", told IANS.\nThe 42-year-old is content with his work so far.\nAsked about doing TV shows, he said: \"I don't watch TV. There's no time. I am enjoying acting in movies. So, it's better to focus on that only,\" he said.\nHe just hopes to grow with every film as an actor.\n\"I never thought that people would be inspired by me. I just came here to work. Thank god I got what I wanted. People get inspired by work. So, I should grow with every film. I like to focus on honesty and hard work. These are the only two things that are in my control. Rest, it's up to the audience,\" said the actor, who has films like \"Raees\" and Anurag Kashyap's upcoming directorial.\nFor now, he is proud to be associated with \"the prestigious brand\" Mayur Suitings as its ambassador.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:58:34.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
