She'll probably need to clear some shelf space for more of them with her latest novel, \"What You See.\"\nA reporter and a policeman don't mix, so Brogan and Ryland have been keeping their feelings for each other a secret. But Ryland is jobless at the moment, so they decide they can start telling people that they are dating.\nWhen a man is stabbed in the middle of a crowded Boston tourist attraction, cellphones and surveillance footage seem to capture the event from multiple angles, and with all the witnesses in the crowd, it appears to be a slam dunk for Brogan.\nUnfortunately, everything isn't what it seems.\nRyland is offered a job at a news station, and she must weigh the consequences of the job and her relationship with Brogan if she says \"yes.\" To make things more difficult, a wedding involving her family takes a tragic turn when the youngster who was to be the flower girl is abducted by her stepfather.\nRyan, an on-air investigative reporter for four decades and the winner of more than 30 Emmy Awards, knows the world of television news. Her expertise translates well to the page since she knows how to tell a story and keep the viewer (and the reader) engaged and enthralled.\nThe layers of the puzzles are complex and unpredictable in \"What You See.\" Mystery fans should drop everything and pick up this book.\n___\nOnline:\nhttp://hankphillippiryan.com/\nArts & Entertainment Books & Publishing Hank Phillippi Ryan", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:53:15.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
