But, more importantly, this sequel will be dubbed Ant-Man and the Wasp , which means we're going to see some super-heroine badassery from the first female in a Marvel movie title , Wasp.\nHere's what you need to know about the Wasp:\nEvangeline Lilly's Hope van Dyne is Wasp In Ant-Man, Lilly played Hope van Dyne, the fighter who trains Paul Rudd's Ant-Man to shrink, kick butt and be awesome.\nHope's mom was the Wasp first The first Ant-Man movie taught us that Hope had a mother named Janet who wore the original Wasp suit. Unfortunately, Mama was lost in the quantum realm and gone, so throughout the entire Ant-Man movie, Hope tries to convince her father Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) that she’s ready to suit up.\nWe knew Hope would be the Wasp after seeing the Ant-Man post-credits Hank finally relented in the first post-credit scene, where he says it's time for Hope to wear the Wasp suit. And now she gets a movie (with Ant-Man)!\nThe Wasp can shrink and fly Like Ant-Man, the Wasp has the power to change in size. In the comics, she can also sprout wings and fly.\nThe Wasp was an original Avenger The Wasp is actually in the first group of Avengers in the comics with Thor, Iron Man, Ant-Man and the Hulk. In fact, Wasp is the one who named the crew The Avengers.\n5 CONNECT 15 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 //usat.ly/1RwHhFG TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cd46894507698bf8b9690130f0c17c48e0027267/c=0-0-1611-1211&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799236653774717-XXX-PTR2547-comp-v130.1082-R-dcb.JPG", "http://usat.ly/1RwHhFG", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RwHhFG&text=5%20things%20you%20should%20know%20about%20the%20Wasp&via=usatoday", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RwHhFG&mini=true"], "published": "2015-10-09T01:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:58:44.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
