Coaches Adam Levine, Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani and Pharrell Williams now have eight artists each on his or her team heading into next week's knockout rounds. \nOnce again, there were appearances during rehearsals by mentors John Fogerty (Team Adam), Brad Paisley (Team Blake) and Missy Elliott (Team Pharrell). Team Gwen didn't compete during the episode. \nThe first battle of the night featured Team Adam's Amanda Ayala and Shelby Brown. Adam assigned themStevie Nicks’“Edge of Seventeen.” \nGwen said Shelby filled the room with \"incredible power.\" Adam thanked Shelby for \"sassing it up,\" while calling Amanda a \"pro.\" He named Shelby the winner. Amanda was eliminated. \nNext up were Team Pharrell's Amy Vachal and Jubal and Amanda. You'll recall Jubal and Amanda got engaged immediately after their blind audition. The two acts tackled the Bee Gees' \"To Love Somebody.\" \nGwen described the performance as a \"contrast.\" Adam joked that Amy was like a third wheel on a date. Blake said as great as Jubal and Amanda are, he doesn't know how Pharrell can continue without Amy. Pharrell stuck with Amy. Jubal and Amanda are gone from the competition. \nFor the final battle, Blake paired Emily Ann Roberts with Morgan Frazier -- his \"two young country girls,\" in his own words. He gave them \"I'm That Kind Of Girl\" by Patty Loveless. \nBlake compared the final note Morgan hit with Carrie Underwood-type talent. He said he was heartbroken that he had to pick between the two. He settled on Emily Ann, and Morgan was stolen by Pharrell. \nThe knockout rounds launch next Monday night on NBC. Rihanna will serve as a guest adviser. \nHere's what each team looks like going into the knockout rounds: Team Adam: Andi & Alex; Blaine Mitchell; Dustin Christensen; James Dupré; Jordan Smith; Keith Semple; Shelby Brown; Viktor Király. Team Blake: Barrett Baber; Blind Joe; Chance Peña; Chris Crump; Emily Ann Roberts; Ivonne Acero; Nadjah Nicole; Zach Seabaugh. Team Gwen: Braiden Sunshine; Ellie Lawrence; Jeffery Austin; Korin Bukowski; Kota Wade; Regina Love; Riley Biederer; Summer Schappell. Team Pharrell: Amy Vachal; Darius Scott; Evan McKeel; Madi Davis; Mark Hood; Siahna Im; Tim Atlas; Morgan Frazier. \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
