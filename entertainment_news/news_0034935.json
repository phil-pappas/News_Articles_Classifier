She had not thought of marriage when her parents gave her away to a post war veteran almost twice her age. Her husband's very queer behaviors, including gross infidelity and lack of interest or involvement in his family affairs, caused Jutrida a great deal of anguish throughout the marriage.\nAll the very bizarre incidents that occurred during the course of their relationship and events during the burial and funeral ceremonies caused Jutrida torment and misery, even after her husband’s death. She never told anyone of her pain or the happenings, because her husband made her promise never to tell what transpired, but now she longed to open up.\nShe found the inspiration to at least put the issues down in writing after listening to Oprah Winfrey's Super Soul Programs, particularly her interview with Tyler Perry. Putting the problems down in writing gave her some relief and compiling it into a readable manuscript has brought almost a complete cure as someone out there might have answers to her troubling questions.\nReaders who wish to experience this engrossing work can purchase “Jutrida” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708.\nAbout Page Publishing\nPage Publishing is a traditional New York based full-service publishing house that handles all of the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
