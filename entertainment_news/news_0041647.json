The first concert “back home” at the Saenger Theatre sets the tone for the new year, for performers and audience both. Expectations run high. \nIt’s an annual challenge for Music Director Peter Rubardt to build a program to fit the occasion. There must be joy, but also intensity. The guest soloist must contribute to both, the resident principals be given a showcase — and if there is pathos, and a wee dram of darkness, too, all the better. \nSaturday evening met, even exceeded, these goals with apparent effortlessness. Rubardt’s choice of pieces — Richard Strauss’s “Don Juan (Op. 20),” Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky’s “Francesca da Rimini (Op. 32)” and Sergei Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto No. 2 in C minor (Op. 18) — brought together compositions much beloved yet exceedingly demanding. \nUp to intermission, the concert belonged to the home team. With several fresh faces here and there among the strings, a few jitters from that section at the opening of the Strauss were to be expected. The principals, especially the horns and winds, stabilized play, however, and supported Rubardt, exuberant all evening at the podium, to bring about a conclusion worthy of the composer. \nAlthough “Don Juan,” with its many starts and halts, is not really a “tidbit” (to quote Rubardt), “Francesca da Rimini” — often described as Tchaikovsky’s most passionately involved efforts — pushed everyone on stage to reach higher and deeper musically and emotionally. Even Rubardt, always an energetic, physical baton, seemed momentarily drained at the finish. This time there were no jitters, and Rubardt justly singled out for applause Matt Fossa (oboe), Richard Jernigan (clarinet — with big parts all night, delivering brilliantly), Jeff Keesecker (bassoon), Jaquelyn Adams (horn), Stephanie Riegle (flute) and Leonid Yanovskiy (first violin/Concertmaster). \nWhat will be remembered by all in attendance, nevertheless, was the night’s latter half. The Cuban pianist Jorge Luis Prats, barred for 30 years from performing in the U.S., took Rachmaninoff, the audience and the entire orchestra, as well, into his superbly talented hands. If ever a reason was needed to end the embargo, Prats was it. His second Concerto was heart-stopping and heart-breaking in turns, and brought the house to its feet for an unstoppable applause that led a moved Prats to deliver an almost unbelievable three encores: Ignacio Cervantes’ “Danzas Cubanas,” Ernesto Lecuona’s “Mazurka” and Richard Wagner’s “Liebestod” (Liszt’s arrangement) from “Tristan and Isolde.” The year ahead has a high bar to reach, to match this.
