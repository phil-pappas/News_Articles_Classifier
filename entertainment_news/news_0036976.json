She passed peacefully surrounded by her loving family as they celebrated her life listening to music from her favorite movie, The Quiet Man.\" \nMaureen is remembered for extraordinary Irish looks and exceptionally brilliant acting skills. Her hair was flaming red, eyes were green and had a peach skin. She is famously known for her debut in classics, Miracle On 34th Street and Parent Trap. She was casted opposite John Wayne. \nMaureen's presence in Hollywood is known since 1939 and she was one of the last names who belonged to the Golden Era! She was never nominated for an Academy Award, but was awarded an honorary Oscar in 2014 for career achievements. \nBesides her role as an actress, she was also the CEO of Antilles Air Boats, which carried the tourists around the Caribbean islands, and owner and columnist of the Virgin Islander, a tourist magazine that was sold in the U.S. and British Virgin Islands. \nMaureen was born in Ireland and carried her birth name Maureen FitzSimons until she met the actor Charles Laughton who was intrigued by her looks and not by her birth name suggested to call herself Maureen O' Hara. \nMaureen began acting at the age of 6 and went to Abbey Theatre at 14. She was trained in singing and dancing from a very young age. Just at the age of 16 she gave a screen test in London. On failing the screen test, she wrote in her 2004 memoir, ‘Tis Herself' that, \"I was mad as hell and disappointed by the whole unprofessional event,\" \nThough Maureen and John Wayne's on-screen romanced bloomed, they were never romantically involved outside the movies. Her family once told ‘PEOPLE' that, \"Who would prefer anybody to John Wayne?\" \nAs all her fans around the world are mourning the loss of the legendary actress, the family said, \"For those who may ask what they can do to honor Maureen. We have a simple request: visit Ireland one day and think of her.\" \nMaureen will be buried at Arlington National Cemetery, in Washington, D.C., alongside her husband, a U.S. Navy pilot, according to the Times.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T08:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:52:44.228+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
