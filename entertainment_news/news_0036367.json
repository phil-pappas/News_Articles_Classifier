The carving artist – who along with his team has survived three episodes of competition on the Food Network’s show “Halloween Wars” -- is giving a class and demonstration this afternoon from Noon to 3:00.\nHis artistry is legendary. And you can see a free demonstration today starting at 11:00 at Wambach’s garden Center, 2590 Culver Road. It will be followed by a chance to learn how to do it.\n“It’s an interactive class where I will teach all ages and skill levels how to take their pumpkin carving up a notch,” says Bierton. “Everything is included in the ticket price. All you have to do is show up. You’ll leave the class with your very own pumpkin masterpiece guaranteed to be the best on the block!”\nFor tickets: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/a-pumpkin-carving-workshop-with-adam-bierton-tickets-19154569834\nKenneth Warner Blogger: Rochester: MORE FROM OurTownsBlog Wendell Castle works at NYC museum!
