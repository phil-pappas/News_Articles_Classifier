The mother of three has been open about her battle with depression, but it's the first time she talked about suffering from post-natal depression. \"I did suffer from it with one of my pregnancies, but I was suffering from depression anyways,\" she said. \"The depression is so dark, you feel like you're in a black fog the whole time and you just cannot cope. And you get to a point where you don't realize what you've got with the baby and you're just so dark and distraught and alone and it's the loneliest feeling in the world.\" \"My husband was away for six weeks after I gave birth, so I was on my own,\" Sharon added on her show \" The Talk \", referring to Black Sabbath 's frontman Ozzy Osbourne . \"My pediatrician knew I was having trouble and he helped me.
