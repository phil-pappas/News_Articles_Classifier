Because not all are appropriate for younger children, age recommendations are included. \nThe story of Peter Pan, \"the boy who wouldn't grow up,\" has captivated families for more than a century with its fairies, flying and fighting pirates. Originally told in a play by J.M. Barrie in 1904 , the story is one that has been visited in film multiple times through the years, including the recently released \"Pan.\" Here are five films that each take a different spin on the tale: \nIn theaters: 'Pan' \n“Pan” is an origin story that tells of a 12-year-old orphan named Peter who is whisked away to Neverland, where he discovers his destiny to become Peter Pan. MovieGuide.org calls the recently released film “an exciting adventure” and emphasizes the film’s “stunning, exciting, spectacular images … (that change) from darker colors to lighter, brighter, joyous colors as Peter find his purpose.” The website cautions, however, that “some scary moments may be too much for younger children.” Ok.com recommends the film for viewers ages 8 and older. \nNetflix: 'Hook' \nThe late Robin Williams stars as an adult Peter Pan who returns to Neverland to rescue his children after they’ve been kidnapped by Captain Hook. The film is rated PG, but Common Sense Media warns that it contains mentions of suicide and some frightening situations. Ok.com recommends the film for viewers ages 8 and older. \niTunes: 'Peter Pan' (2003) \nThis live-action film stays close to J.M. Barrie’s original play as the Darling children follow Peter Pan to Neverland. The Dove Foundation praised the film’s “traditional family values” as the Darling children learn “the adventures of Neverland are not worth giving up the love of family.” Ok.com recommends the film for viewers ages 6 and older. \nNetflix: 'Finding Neverland' \nAuthor J.M. Barrie befriends a widow and her four young sons and finds inspiration for his now-beloved character Peter Pan. PluggedIn.com refers to the film as “loosely biographical” and praises “its nuanced attention to the way small decisions can so radically change your life.\" Ok.com recommends the film for viewers ages 8 and older. \nDVD: 'Peter Pan' (1953) \nDisney’s animated “Peter Pan” is recognized by audiences young and old. Parent Previews attributes the film’s enduring ability to “hook” fans to “the animated magic and enchanting music, or maybe it’s the classic tale’s reminder of youth’s simple pleasures.” Ok.com recommends the film for viewers ages 3 and older.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T10:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T17:12:44.618+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
