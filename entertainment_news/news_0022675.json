Photo: Supplied \nThe Odd Couple. Wesley Enoch's final play as Queensland Theatre's Company's artistic director demonstrates how society's gender roles have changed… or not.\nThe Odd Couple celebrates it's \"golden jubilee\" this year, marking 50 years since the first production of Neil Simon's infamous play in 1965.\nArtistic director Wesley Enoch explains The Odd Couple has themes and commentaries on gender stereotypes that are still relevant today.\n\"It's interesting how 50 years later the play still has this wonderful commentary on masculinity and masculine identity in a society,\" he said.\nAdvertisement \"The poker games and things like that, it's had a real resurgence amongst young men now, you know, doing the whole cigar and poker game thing.\"\nOther themes underlying the narrative in the play have improved over the years, but are not as far behind us as they could be, he said.\n\"In some ways it's aged because there are some incredibly sexist things that have been said,\" Enoch said.\n\"But you understand that it's worth being thoughtful about because, sometimes, this sexism is still up and about.\n\"It's good to go back and have a look at our history and say what's changed and what hasn't changed.\"\nThe Odd Couple is Wesley's final show in Brisbane before he leaves for Sydney to become artistic director of the Sydney Festival.\n\"I've been at the QTC for five years, and this notion of having a big celebratory comedy with a number of actors that I've all worked with before in different shows … It's a little bit of a love letter back to Brisbane, about the talent of Brisbane, and what I love about Brisbane,\" Enoch said.\n\nThe Odd Couple is the story of how opposites attract.\nOscar is a slob, and Felix is neurotically clean. The pair could not be more different, but are fast friends.\nTension builds between the two when they have to move in together, because both men are going through divorce.\n\"The messy slob, vs the pedantic neat freak and how they share a house together after their divorce… their tensions. Everyone knows about opposites attract and that's exactly what this play's about. It's hilarious… good old fashioned, structure comedy,\" Enoch said.\nThe Odd Couple opens October 22 at the QPAC Playhouse Theatre , and plays through until November 8.\nStay informed.
