Ms Andrews would not be discussing her age or Mary Poppins. Fair enough. There are other subjects to broach with a star of her standing and longevity. \nBut yes, longevity. The day we meet she has just turned 80. And that very morning she'd been on television in New York giving her blessing to a new Mary Poppins film. \"It's time,\" she said. \nUshered by handlers into a room in an old mill inside the New York Botanical Gardens where she was waiting, this reporter was thus briefly floored. \nMaybe just coming face to face with Julie Andrews did it. As Sigourney Weaver suggests later during the same evening, Ms Andrews has that effect on people: \"She is someone who even if you don't know her, you kind of grew up with her, so you sort of do.\" \nMs Andrews, who after the death of her husband, the director Blake Edwards, moved five years ago from Los Angeles to the Hamptons on Long Island, was at the gardens to be honoured for her love of roses. Ms Weaver, in case you are wondering, was there as a member of the Botanical Gardens board and avid promoter of everything they offer. \nSo it seemed opening with a gardening question was the only option. Andrews, you won't be surprised to learn, has an extraordinarily mellifluous way of speaking. She still sounds more English than the English and is meticulously polite and self-deprecating. \"I can't claim to be a very knowledgeable botanist, but I love what I see and what I have.\" She makes special mention of trees. \nHer interest in roses has not been made up for the evening.

As part of her research, she found a passage in her diary from 1963 precisely about roses. She read us an excerpt several minutes long. \n\"Almost every morning when I go to the studio to work,\" she wrote back then, \"I discover a fresh rose in the bud vase on my dressing table ... one living and vital thing in a dusty arena of powder and tissue and matches and greasepaint.\" \nThe dinner tables are silent. Andrews is putting on a carefully rehearsed performance that recalls her talent both as an actress and a writer. The diary entry, written 50 years ago, ends with Andrews suggesting she would like to be reincarnated as a rose, but unsure what kind of rose she'd like to be. \nShe settles on \"an average garden rose, a common honest flower that in bud may look vaguely peachy-primrose. As its lifespan begins and the sun gently warms, opening it generously and fully to a stretching and vibrant existence one is dazzled by its infinite subtleties... It has nothing to hide and it seems to say: 'Savour me, smell me, feel me, pluck me. I am here to give you pleasure. Enjoy'.\" \nThe last line is delivered with complete insouciance, as if the sexual overtones had escaped her completely. But in our interview we talk gender, if not quite sex, and eventually Mary Poppins.

It was while on Broadway that she began to have trouble with her voice that led her to undergo disastrous throat surgery in 1997, which took her singing voice away. \nAndrews concurs: the film and musical broke important ice on the topic of gender-switching and transitioning. The musical tells of a broke soprano enlisting a gay actor to help her get work performing as a man pretending to be a woman. \n\"And that makes me so happy, because the whole movie was about love and loving people,\" she says. \"It's all thanks to my wonderful husband.\" \nAs for Poppins, it was in fact her creator, PL Travers, we ended up talking about. Has she seen the film Saving Mr Banks, starring Emma Thompson as the writer and Tom Hanks as Walt Disney, and was Travers really as formidable as the film portrayed her? \"Yes. Tough! And the movie does not pull any punches.\" \nShe recalls Travers calling her the day after she had given birth to Emma and then demanding they meet for tea. \n\"This voice said, 'Hello, this is PL Travers. Is this Julie?' I said, 'Yes.' She said, 'Well, talk to me.' I said, 'I just had a baby yesterday Ms Travers' and she said, 'Well, you are going to be doing Mary Poppins, right?' And she said, 'Well, of course you are far too pretty, but you have got the nose for it'.\" \nWhat did she make of the film once released? \"I don't think she ever approved totally of the movie,\" Andrews replies. \"But she probably cried all the way to the bank, if you know what I mean.\" \nWhich presumably would be roughly her reaction today, were she still alive, to the news that Disney is planning to make not just one but possibly several new Poppins films. \n- THE INDEPENDENT", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:31:19.417+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
