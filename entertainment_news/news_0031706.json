Yes, you read that correctly: the world's longest conversation via video hangout broadcasted LIVE! The record-shattering chat will commence on October 22, 2015, and will last for 14 days; 24 hours a day without disconnecting for sleep or even bathroom runs!\nWhy take on such a task? Alex and Rob fell into a series of \"you won't\" dares, which inevitably led to the \"longest video chat world-record challenge.\" Plus, two ten-year-old girls currently hold the record and video chatted for 10 days straight. So obviously, they felt the need to destroy the record and prove that they are better than two 10-year old girls.\nThe entire video chat will stream live via NoHangUps.tv , where viewers can submit dares and see both comedians participate in their challenges. People can also tweet Rob and Alex using @NoHangUpsTV to submit comments, questions and suggest daily activities and dares. All suggestions received will have to be completed while on video chat. People can let their imaginations run wild! Want to pick a Tinder date for Alex? Want to pick the Halloween costumes the guys should wear? Tweet and watch the funny antics LIVE.\nALEX WEBER is a Comedian, Host, Actor, and Producer who has starred in numerous TV shows, digital content, and commercials.
