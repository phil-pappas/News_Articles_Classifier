Ernest | Oct 21, 2015 Photo by: Andrew Hall The CarnEVIL crew poses for a photo on this year’s first Fright at the Fort night. Enlarge... \nProspect — A couple of days before this year’s edition of Fright at the Fort opened at the Fort Knox State Historic site, CarnEVIL clownmeister Jeremy Sawyer was up to hunting camp, hours north of Prospect. But he and his ghastly greasepainters had been working on their Fright act for months, so things were well in white-gloved hand. \n“I’ll be back Friday, so it’s good,” he said by tenuous phone connection from Eustis. \nGood and ghoulish, that is. CarnEVIL comes up with new takes on clown creepiness every year, expanding upon an underlying fear that makes for guaranteed shivers. \n“We gave ourselves the name … One out of every three people is afraid of clowns, so we kind of based it on that,” he said. \nCarnEVIL has been part of Fright at the Fort for five or six years now. The last few years, the troupe has occupied the last “room” of the guided tour that leads brave souls through the dark, twisting corridors of the 19-century granite fort which, let’s face it, can be a little spooky in broad daylight. Last year. CarnEVIL created a funhouse tour-within-the-tour in their room, one of a number of “scenes” Fright at the Fort offers tour takers. \n“We put up walls, used black light. This year, we fixed it up and worked on props,” Sawyer said. \nThat work begins in winter, when the CarnEVIL compatriots — numbering around 20 these days — get together for supper and start making plans for a Fright-full fall. Most of the members are from the Searsport area, Sawyer said, and during the summer, they raise funds by selling baked goods during the town’s 4th of July parade and fireworks. As the calendar advances, there are weekend workdays to prepare for Fright at the Fort. \nWhy is Searsport spook central? Credit goes to the town’s high school drama crowd, led by teacher Chris Goosman, which makes up a good chunk of the event’s volunteer fearmongers. It’s how the 20-something Sawyer got his start. \n“To be honest, I’m not a big holiday person. … Halloween is by far my favorite,” he said. “You get to the age you can’t trick-or-treat anymore. You stay at home, but it gets boring.” \nWhen he was 13 or 14, Sawyer said, he started doing Fright at the Fort with the Searsport District High School contingent and he’s been at it ever since. A couple of the current CarnEVIL cohorts are high school seniors, but most are college age or working full-time … so much so that the volunteer troupe likely will put out a call for fresh blood next year. \nOf course, having a job comes in handy — creepy clown costumes sometimes don’t come cheap. The troupe sports a mix of homemade and purchased costumes and a growing collection of movie-quality masks. Sawyer would like to get more of those, but bake sales don’t really cover the cost. \n“I paid $500 for my mask, out of my own pocket,” he said of his rubber face with neon-green hair. \nIt’s a price he’s willing to pay for the privilege of celebrating Halloween almost year-round. This year’s Fright runs for five nights, including the holiday itself. Remaining tours run Fridays and Saturdays, Oct. 23, 24, 30 and 31 from 5:30 to 9 p.m. (the evenings’ last tours depart at 8:30 p.m.). \nEach year’s Fright has a theme; this year’s is Water Over the Damned, adding wet weirdness to what is already fog-filled, damp dread. But don’t worry about slipping — 110 percent safety is the goal, said Sawyer. \n“We run every idea past Leon and he says aye or nay. Safety is the number-1 priority,” he said. \nLeon Seymour is the executive director of the nonprofit Friends of Fort Knox, which uses the proceeds of the annual Fright fundraiser in its Fort Knox preservation efforts. CarnEVIL co-organizer Andrew Hall is a member of the Friends. \n“That’s right, the clowns are on the board,” said Sawyer. \nThey’re also on Facebook, which warns “See you in the darkness, Rabbits!” Photos from last year’s Fright reveal a motley mix of classic whiteface clowns gone awry and other specters, including a doomed Raggedy Ann and an Invisible Man. The CarnEVIL clowns do a little roaming around the fort, but for the most part focus their unnerving energies on that final room. \nFright at the Fort is not for the faint of heart, but some people do bring children — some of whom don’t seem that scared, which Sawyer said surprises him a little. Even those who are will find a reward in the room of CarnEVIL clowns. \n“We give them a little gift and say congratulations, you made it through,” Sawyer said. \nTickets for Fright at the Fort are $10, $5 for children younger than 12. Those who want to avoid the ticket line, which can get long, can consider express tickets, $12 and $7 in advance at FrightXTix.com .
