Reports say, The Force Awakens is going to be 142 minutes long and that would make it the third longest Star Wars movie after the Attack of the Clones and The Phantom Menace. \nStar Wars: The Force Awakens is directed by J. J. Abrams. He is also known for the Lost series, Mission Impossible movies and the new Star Trek movies. \nWhile talking about the characters in the 7th Episode of the Star Wars, Abram said, \"As you see in the best of storytelling, and no doubt the best of Star Wars, these are tales in which an every person has to step up.\" \n\"And I think that what makes Ren so unique is that he isn't as fully formed as when we meet a character such as Darth Vader,\" He further added. \"And I think that there are two sides to the Force. Both sides, arguably, would see themselves as the hero of their story, and I think that applies here.\" \nIn a few hours' time the official trailer of Star Wars: The Force Awakens will be out and so will be sale of tickets to the movie. The space adventure movie fans couldn't wait any longer as they've been solving the puzzle with bits and pieces from the teaser posters. \nThe trailer is going to give the fans all the information they've been awaiting to know about another great Star Wars series.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T09:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:14:05.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
