For more information or reservations, call 568-3253. \nCantankerous features Pam Schilhab on harmony vocals, concertina, harmonica and washboard; and Doug Nye and his original quirky, yet often serious, songs on guitar, harmonica and lead vocals (audiences will want to see his Chicken and Egg guitars). Both are music veterans of many musical projects from old time country, funk, rock ‘n’ roll, contra dance bands and solo performing. \nThe musicians met around a party campfire last year and, sensing a musical compatibility, vowed they would get together and make some serious music. Schilhab winters and plays music in Colorado, so Cantankerous was initiated this spring and has had a fine summer performing and honing a fun and entertaining program of original songs. \nThis event is the last chance to hear what Schilhab and Nye have produced until next spring, when they will pick it up again. The Playhouse Theater has somewhat limited seating, so concertgoers are encouraged to be there on time or call ahead for reservations. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
