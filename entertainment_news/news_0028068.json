Photo: Twitter \nThe host poked a small hole in the side of the bottle, poked the straw through it and sealed it in place, and then filled the bottle with water - a fairly similar technique to that used by generations of Australian stoners, armed with juice or soft drink bottles and cut-off pieces of garden hose to make their own bongs (or so we've heard).\nAdvertisement Screenshots of the craft project - which of course had nothing to do with drug use and was a perfectly innocent piece of children's programming - have provided much amusement for users of social media and sites like Reddit, where one user declared: 'Ok. Time for an ABC Inquiry. They're making bongs on Play School.'\n\"In the ning nang nong where the cows smoke bongs,\" replied another.\nDear @ABCMediaWatch can you have a word to Play School?

Then he went behind me and said, 'Lovely rear entrance,' and kept going.\n\n\"He could do that.
