Now that tradition is hopping across the pond to right here in Louisville. \nLouisville's version of the event will start Friday night at 9 p.m. at Molly Malone's in the Highlands and will go through Sunday. There will be lots of contests for things such as the most freckles, reddest of beards and even the greenest eyes. Even man's best friend gets a red based award. \nFor more information, head on over to the WHAS 11 newslinks tab on the left side here .  //on.whas11.com/1Llx12e More Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:22:48.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
