The greatest gift one can give is love.\nThe election is scheduled for Tuesday.\nSanta Claus previously ran a short-lived campaign for president of the United States in 2012.\nCopyright 2015 by United Press International Share Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1732947", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1732947&h=Santa+Claus+campaigning+for+North+Pole+City+Council", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1732947&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:38:26.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
