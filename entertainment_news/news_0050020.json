The film looks at Omar Khadr one of the most controversial and polarizing figures of the past two decades and features the first and only exhaustive interview he has granted since his release from a prison in Edmonton this past May. \nGuantanamo's Child will play at 11:30 a.m. at Eau Claire on Oct. 4. Khadr speaks at Calgary screening: 'It's been a long journey' \nROOM \nThis is the film that wowed audiences last month at the Toronto International Film Festival winning the People's Choice Award and it's working the same kind of magic in Calgary. This is the harrowing story of a woman who was kidnapped and imprisoned when she was 19 forced to have sex with her captor almost nightly. These rapes resulted in the birth of her son who she spent five years trying to give as normal a life as possible. There is already talk that both Brie Larson as the heroic woman and Jacob Tremblay as her son will receive Oscar nominations come January. You'll have a chance to decide for yourself when Room plays once again at Eau Claire at 9:15 p.m. on Oct. 4. \nLANDFILL HARMONIC \nThere's no doubt this documentary about children in Paraguay rising about adversity is one of the most uplifting experiences at this year's festival and it certainly deserves another showing. The children, members of the Recycled Orchestra, lived in a village that grew up beside a garbage dump and the instruments they play are all fashioned from reclaimed garbage like oil cans, pipes and sheets of tin. You will watch in disbelief as they learn to play these instruments and become international celebrities and then you'll watch as they must reclaim their homes when they are destroyed in the worst flood the area suffered in more than two decades. \nLandfill Harmonic plays at 1:30 p.m. at the Globe Cinema on Oct. 4. \nHOW TO PLAN AN ORGY IN A SMALL TOWN \nGales of laughter greeted the screenings of this Canadian comedy about a sex columnist who returns to the hometown that shunned her to help a group of eccentrics plan an orgy. Little do they know the young woman has an ulterior motive in accepting their offer and it's one they'll come to regret. Two years ago writer/director Jeremy Lalonde's Sex After Kids was also a hit at CIFF indicating Lalonde knows a thing or two about Canadiana. \nYou can join in the orgy at Eau Claire at 9:30 p.m. on Oct. 4 \nTickets for these special screening go on sale at 9 a.m. on line on Oct. 2 and at the Eau Claire box-office at 11:30 .m. \nTrailers for all five films can be found at calgaryfilm.com Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:14:10.454+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
