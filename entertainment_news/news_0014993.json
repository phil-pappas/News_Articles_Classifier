They will also work on creating their own mini-opera about their neighborhood, the organizers said. \nAs part of the program, Lincoln Center also worked with JCAL to showcase local artists who will participate in several workshops preceding the events. \n“We are truly exhilarated about this partnership with Lincoln Center which offers not only quality artistic programs in various forms, but opportunities for interactive hands-on and community participation,” said Cathy Hung, executive director of the Jamaica Center for Arts & Learning. \nThe Boro-Linc initiative began last year with several Lincoln Center events at the Casita Maria Center for Arts & Education in The Bronx. This fall the program was expanded to Jamaica and Staten Island. \nThe schedule for Boro-Linc events in Jamaica this fall includes: \nSaturday, Nov. 7 \n2 p.m. — 3 p.m. Community Artist Workshop \n3 p.m. — 4 p.m. Lincoln Center Education: Shine & The Moonbeams (recommended for ages 0-7) \nSaturday, Nov. 14 \n2 p.m. — 3 p.m. Community Artist Workshop \n3 p.m. — 4 p.m. New York Philharmonic: Very Young People’s concert, Philharmonic Playground: Treble and Bass (recommended for ages 3-6 with families) \nSaturday, Nov. 21 \n2 p.m. — 3 p.m. Community Artist Workshop \n3 p.m. — 4 p.m. Chamber Music Society: Chamber Music Beginnings — Musical Moods (recommended for ages 8-10) \nSaturday, Dec. 5 \n2 p.m. — 4 p.m. Metropolitan Opera Guild: Opera in your Neighborhood!
