Law enforcement sources say it is several pages long and in it, the 26-year-old Chris Harper Mercer made statements suggesting that he may have been depressed and angry.\nAuthorities investigating the shooting say they have found a number of firearms at the gunman's apartment and CBS News correspondent Jeff Peques reports that one of the guns recovered at the scene of the shooting is not registered to the gunman.\nOfficials say Harper opened fire at Umpqua Community College Thursday, killing nine people and wounding seven others before dying during an exchange of gunfire with officers.\nDouglas County Sheriff John Hanlin told television stations in Eugene, Oregon, early Friday that investigators were at the college and Mercer's nearby apartment throughout the night.\nView Gallery Douglas County Deputy Sheriff Greg Kennerly, left, and Oregon State Trooper Tom Willis, stand guard outside the apartment building, Friday Oct. 2 2015, where Umpqua Community College gunman Chris Harper Mercer lived, in Roseburg, Ore.

He also had a .40-caliber Taurus pistol traced to someone in Portland, as well as body armor.\nInvestigators are still trying to determine how the gunman obtained a .556 caliber rifle, which is similar to an AR-15, Pegues reports.\nA law enforcement source told CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milton that the shooter's body armor was a bullet-proof vest. It is unclear if he was actually wearing it when he was fatally shot or had it with him.\nHanlin also says investigators went door to door in the neighborhoods near the college and the shooter's apartment to try to learn more details.\nPlay Video CBS This Morning Oregon college shooter appeared ready for gun battle to the end Law enforcement sources tell CBS News that Umpqua Community College shooter Chris Harper Mercer had four guns, a bulletproof vest and extra magaz...\nPeques reports that a receipt from the campus store was also found at the shooting scene and investigators believe it belonged to Mercer.\nSocial media profiles linked to Mercer suggested he was fascinated by the IRA, frustrated by traditional organized religion and tracked other mass shootings.\nCarmen Nesnick, the stepsister of Mercer , said her stepbrother was not a religious nor anti-religious person and that her family is Christian.\n\"All he ever did was put everybody before himself.

He appeared to have at least one online dating profile.\nOn a torrents streaming site and blog that appeared to belong to Mercer, posts referenced multiple shootings and downloads included several horror films and a documentary on a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.\nA blog post urged readers to watch the online footage of Vester Flanagan shooting two former colleagues on live TV in Virginia, while another lamented materialism as preventing spiritual development.\nIn one post on the blog about Flanagan, Mercer apparently wrote, \"I have noticed that so many people like [Flanagan] are alone and unknown, yet when they spill a little blood, the whole world knows who they are. A man who was known by no one, is now known by everyone. His face splashed across every screen, his name across the lips of every person on the planet, all in the course of one day.
