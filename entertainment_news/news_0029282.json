On Thursday, October 1, executive producer I. Marlene King shared the first sneak peek of the new intro in the form of a TBT picture. The image taken during the filming reveals that Alison ( Sasha Pieterse ) will be featured alongside the Liars in the intro. The girls, standing side by side, are all dressed in black, hinting at a somber tone of the intro. \"#TBT to the day we shot the new PLL opening title sequence...,\" King captioned the image. A photo posted by @imarleneking on Oct 1, 2015 at 5:55pm PDT \"Liars\" will return with the remaining of its sixth season in January. King said after the summer finale that season 6B would feature a new \"Big Bad.\" She teased, \"But there is a Big Bad in this new world that we're creating as we move forward, and the Liars are talking to Ali about the person they suspect to be this Big Bad.\" She also told EW that the newly introduced mystery \"is definitely brand new, but there's some connection to the past. Not a mystery revolving around the past, but a connection to the past.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T07:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:23:25.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
