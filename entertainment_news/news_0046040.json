The scene caused a huge amount of controversy because, well, there was absolutely no repercussions from it whatsoever. That's until now.\nIf you don't want to know, you'd better look away now.\n...\n...\n...\nStill here? OK, here's what Cavill had to say. \"What happens there is one of Bruce’s buildings gets destroyed and he’s trying to save all the people inside the building and he can’t. So he is this angry person who fears what Superman may do. Why are they just going to trust this super-powered alien? What if he does decide to turn against us?\"\nAffleck weighed in on this scene, too, and how it essentially motivates Batman to suit up again. \"As Affleck describes it, Bruce Wayne has \"found himself in a place of harboring a tremendous amount of rage for Superman. So it’s how he got there, and what that’s done to him, and what that’s done to people around him like Alfred, who are, I think, very scared and worried for him. It’s something that’s interesting and new.\"\nIn fairness, this makes a lot of sense. For one, that final battle sequence in Man of Steel was just absolutely bonkers and the amount of collateral damage had to have a consequence. It just did. It's been a thing in superhero movies where half a city gets destroyed and nobody seems to make much about it.\nThe only film we've seen that's addressed it as such is Guardians of the Galaxy and that was literally when they said the city was evacuated. Every other one, there was mass destruction and probably mass loss of life, but nobody cared.\nNot only that, it's as good a motivation as any for Bruce Wayne to become Batman again. After all, we know that Ben Affleck's take on the character will more older, more cynical and less idealistic than other versions we've seen. The question is why he'd still be Batman after all that time? He wouldn't, so his arc is all about returning to Batman for all the wrong reasons.\nIf you go back and look at Man of Steel and compare the trailer to Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, you can actually see the same scene. Here's a quick .gif to explain it.\nWhat do you think? Does it make sense? Are you excited for Batman v Superman?
