It's her evil arch enemy Zebediah Killgrave aka The Purple Man, who really knows how to get inside Jessica's head. (He might actually *be* in her head? Unclear.)\n\"Jessica...I know your secrets\", Purple Man (David Tennant) menacingly taunts Jones while she is working late at Alias Investigations assembling a photo board of clues. \"I know about your friends. I know about your gift. Jessica Jones, I know everything!\" And then things get even creepier.\nWe can't wait until November 21 when Netflix drops the full season of Jessica Jones . But we'll take a few more trailers between now and then.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wi2hbejO75s"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:09:46.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
