(AP) — Authorities say a man was electrocuted while working on a boat dock at the site of the HGTV Dream Home giveaway in central Florida. \nBrevard County Fire Rescue reports that paramedics responded to the Merritt Island home, about 55 miles southeast of Orlando, Monday afternoon and pulled the unresponsive man out of Indian River Lagoon. The man was rushed to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. \nThe sheriff’s office was investigating the death as an accident. The worker’s name wasn’t immediately released. \nFlorida Today (http://goo.gl/30eEfq ) reports that the home was chosen as part of the show’s 20th annual design project and remodeling effort. A national contest later this year will determine who will win the home. \nA telephone message left with HGTV wasn’t immediately returned.
