She helps, and not only that but I see sides of me now coming out in her. She is incredibly helpful to me as a woman and as a parent. \n\"I'll say to her, 'Mims, can you please have Bear for the next hour? I'm just gonna grab a shower and I've got a couple of things I've got to do.' She's like, 'Yep, sure!' \n\"Children should play with each other, you know? And look after each other.
