Photo: Justin McManus \nControversial 'sex sells' burger mural likely to be censored A petition has been launched online to save a controversial \"Kama Sutra burger\" mural in Brunswick, after a council announced it would consider \"edits\" to the spicy piece of street art.\nThe artwork painted on the wall of Rathdowne Fabrics by street artist Makatron on Tuesday night depicts a huge burger filled with naked people performing sexual acts, along with more conventional ingredients â€“ tomato, lettuce and cheese.\nBy lunchtime Wednesday, the Moreland City Council graffiti team had asked the building owner to remove the mural. It later announced it would hold a meeting to discuss alterations to the mural.\nAdvertisement At time of writing, the petition on Change.org had attracted 46 signatures. Started by a user going by the name of \"Tofu Pirate\", the petition asks that Moreland City Council and mayor Meghan Hopper \"butt out and leave the mural alone.\"\n\"This is a complete over-the-top reaction,\" reads the petition.\n\"The public is mature enough to deal with the slightest suggestion of sexual behaviour, especially when so skilfully hidden within a beautiful juicy burger.\n\"Business owners should be encouraged to commission and pay for great public art like this and should be rewarded.\"\nStreet art patron Dean Sunshine owns Rathdowne Fabrics and commissioned the piece. The building and nearby laneways have become a destination for Melbourne street art.\n\"I get so many people walking down the lane anyway, the people that have been walking down there in the past 24 hours, they're all loving it,\" Sunshine told Fairfax on Thursday.\n\"For him [Makatron], I think it's great that you can put something up on a wall and you can get so many social comments about it and get people talking. Isn't that what art's about?\"\nHopper told Fairfax on Thursday that the council's street art policy was to remove any work deemed offensive or obscene. Council planned to paint over the burger mural on Thursday, but after discussions with Sunshine and Makatron, they will instead meet with the building owner and artist next week to talk about modifications to the artwork.\n\"I understand that the owner of Rathdowne Fabrics is a bit of a street art connoisseur and he wrote a blog about it ... we don't want to discourage local business owners from taking this initiative to deter illegal graffiti, but it's just about getting it right, I guess,\" she said.\n\"I think today's been a good example of how we can work together with the public and get a good outcome.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:14:43.522+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
