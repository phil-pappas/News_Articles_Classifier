These unique cells are responsible in producing, storing and secreting insulin – the hormone that regulates levels of glucose in the blood.\nCurrently one of the most promising therapies in the fight against diabetes is the replacement of beta cells.\nIn the replacement therapy for type 1 diabetes, researchers from Universite Catholique de Louvain in Belgium have previously shown that human pancreatic duct-derived cells (HDDCs) are an attractive source of cells.\nThe cells are found in the adult pancreas and are progenitor cells – cells that have a tendency to differentiate into specific types of cells.\nIn the new study, the group reprogrammed HDDCs to behave like beta cells and secrete insulin within the pancreas, whilst responding to glucose.\nThe researchers used messenger RNA (mRNA) of a transcription factor – a protein that controls which genes are turned off or on in the genome – called MAFA.\nThe mRNA is transformed into protein before binding to cellular DNA in order to orchestrate the changes in cellular functions.\nThis technique allowed the researchers to avoid any potential genetic modification of the target cells.\n“The novelty of our work resides in the use of adult tissue that avoids the risks related to stem cells, such as cancer, and of a protocol that modifies the cells with a direct action on DNA without any structural modification,” said lead investigator Professor Philippe Lysy.\n“Our system for cellular reprogramming with transcription factors using mRNA opens doors for experiments in other scientific fields with the objective to produce cells with a new function in the context of diseases with a loss-of-function,” Lysy said.\nThe group has already developed a mouse model that allows them to transplant their manufactured cells into the diabetic mice and follow-up on their disease.\nThe group is also using a ‘good laboratory practice (GLP)’ facility to produce batches of cells that could eventually be transplanted into human patients with diabetes.\n“With ongoing in vivo studies, we are analysing the potential of our reprogrammed cells to function and secrete insulin into a body according to blood glucose levels,” Lysy said.\nThe research was presented at the 54th Annual European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology Meeting in Spain.\nFirst Published on October 01, 2015 9:39 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:18:59.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
