And boy did they pull out the stops tonight. Laughter and joy were abound as they unpicked the best of the week‚Äôs TV. \nHere‚Äôs what we were all thinking during Friday‚Äôs episode. \n1. OMG STEPH AND DOM ARE BACK. \nThe duo‚Äôs absence from the small screen has not gone amiss. And people were ruddy pleased to see them ‚Äì and their still-large supply of booze ‚Äì back. Hoorah looks like @stephanddom are back on #Gogglebox \n‚Äî Chloe Anderson (@chloeax_) October 23, 2015 \n2. DOWNTON ‚Äì WTF? \nYes. Viewers were ‚Äútreated‚Äù to a second showing of THAT very bloody scene from Sunday‚Äôs Downton Abbey. No no no Gogglebox is showing Downton again. Everybody hide!!! #gogglebox \n‚Äî Helena Smith (@HelenaSmith24) October 23, 2015 Watching Lord Grantham explode the second time doesn't get easier. #Gogglebox \n‚Äî P√°draig McCann (@Padraig_McCann) October 23, 2015 \nWhat just happened? \n‚Äî Aaron Richardson (@AaronLR1991) October 23, 2015 That was the most traumatic thing that has ever happened in the history of Downton Abbey. #Gogglebox \n3. Scarlett Moffatt is 25?! (Channel 4) \nGeordie lass Scarlett let slip that she had turned 25. No one believed her. Scarlet is 25?! I thought she was like 18 #Gogglebox \nShe had a big night out to celebrate ‚Äì and she had a wise word or two about how to guarantee a cracking evening. @ScarlettMoffatt thanks for confirming it‚Ä¶. On a night out 'eating is cheating' #rulesofdrinking1 \n‚Äî Melissa Webb (@bananamellie) October 23, 2015 \n4. No. It does not take eight years to fly to the moon. \nLeeds sisters Ellie and Izzi were a bit confused about space and stuff. ‚ÄúHow long would it take to fly to the moon?‚Äù‚ÄúEight years, I reckon‚Äù #duh #Gogglebox \n‚Äî Inspector Morose (@InspectorMorose) October 23, 2015 \"It takes 8 years to get to the moon\"\"Oh wait only 3 days\" üòÇüòÇüòÇ #gogglebox \n5. Pass the tissues. \nWatching Goggleboxers crying while watching Channel 5‚Ä≤s The Gift of Life made all of us cry. \nThe story of little Ella, the six-year-old girl who was waiting for a heart transport, choked up pretty much everyone. #Gogglebox aw bless that 6 year old, she does not deserve to go through such hell at a very young age! \n‚Äî Sabrina Lagden (@LagdenknowsBest) October 23, 2015 Trying to put makeup on and crying it all back off #gogglebox \n‚Äî Laura Boyle (@LauraBoyle93) October 23, 2015 \n6. Somebody put us on the organ donor list now. \nEveryone was running to make sure they were signed up to donate after Ella‚Äôs story had a happy ending. Well said Siddiqui family ‚Äì that is how humans should be, that's how good they should always be #Gogglebox", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T01:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:41:50.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
