I didn't think I would be invited until I got to college.\n\"This has been my goal to get invited to one of these.''\nSmith is one of 24 players working with national team coaches at the camp that ends Oct. 10. The camp is one of a set to help shape U.S. Soccer's roster for the 2016 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup in Papau, New Guinea.\nMackezie Smith.

The center back/midfielder also was a co-captain in an international tournament played last year in Croatia, where a select United States age-group team took on women's national teams. Smith has a verbal commitment to play at Clemson University in South Carolina.\nThe current U.S. Soccer U-19 national team camp is run by Jitka Klimkova,\n\"It's honestly one of the best experiences I've had,'' Smith said. \"We have April Heinrichs here as our technical adviser. (Tuesday) we had an inter-squad game.''\nUnited States National Team members Whitney Engen and Christen Press stepped in to fill out the roster of players for the inter-squad match.\n\"No one expects to (play against them)!\" Smith said. \"Oh, we were all scared that we would look bad, but it was fun.\n\"It's insane.''\nJAMESJ@Gannett.com", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/08/Rochester/Rochester/635799020715029231-2015-Bath-girls-soccer---Mackenzie-Smith.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0b3afc3a5ad11819919736468495951004d80961/r=295x400/local/-/media/2015/10/08/Rochester/Rochester/635799020715029231-2015-Bath-girls-soccer---Mackenzie-Smith.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e7ac262d66cfba401414201bcc2036abef04645c/c=0-6-590-793&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/10/08/Rochester/Rochester/635799020715029231-2015-Bath-girls-soccer---Mackenzie-Smith.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T22:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:07:09.992+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
