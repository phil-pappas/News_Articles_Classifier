We worked tirelessly to create the right story and assembled an internationally diverse cast that would resonate not only in the Chinese market but for audiences on a global scale. The Hawaii International Film Festival is the largest East meets West film festival in the US, and is the perfect fit for our film. We’re looking forward to showing the finished product that so many people have worked so hard on to audiences for the very first time this November.”\nPALI ROAD is a mesmerizing and chilling journey into the mystery of the human psyche and the power of love. Lily (Chen), a young doctor, wakes up from a car accident to discover she is now married to her boyfriend’s affluent rival, Dr. Mitch Kayne (Kang), has a five-year-old-son, and an established life she has no recollection of. Everyone around her, including her parents, deny that her boyfriend, Neil (Rathbone), ever existed, sending her on a desperate search for the truth. Determined to reclaim a life everyone insists is nothing more than an illusion, Lily eventually begins to doubt her own sanity. Struggling to overcome her seemingly hopeless situation, Lily endures a series of unexplainable and haunting incidents while bravely making her way to an ultimate mind-bending truth about the power of true love.\nShot entirely in Hawaii PALI ROAD is a story about the search for true love between two different worlds. Her search for the truth to her past life will lead her to question everyone around her and her entire existence. PALI ROAD (aka Highway 61) is an idyllic, winding road through some of the most enchanting parts of Oahu and maintains an important if not infamous place in Hawaiian history. Being at the center of many of Oahu’s supernatural activities, it is said the road is haunted and various mysterious figures can be seen wandering the area at all hours. Numerous otherworldly sightings have been confirmed along Pali Road, both by longtime residents of the area as well as tourists who come from all over the world to visit the region.\n“We’ve compiled a diverse, world-renowned cast from the extremely talented Chinese Superstar Michelle Chen to internationally renowned Jackson Rathbone of TWILIGHT fame, to Sung Kang of the FAST & FURIOUS franchise who together bring international box office earnings into the billions of dollars. Our truly adept team, both in front of and behind the camera are helping to fill a gap in the marketplace for English-language Chinese co-productions that audiences around the world are craving, “said Daxing Zhang (Man of Taichi). “PALI ROAD has all of the ingredients of a successful motion picture; a thrilling storyline that will keep audiences on the edge of their seats, constantly guessing what is real, an incredible cast who deliver honest and powerful performances and at the heart of the film, a deep and soulful love story.”\nPALI ROAD is produced by Daxing Zhang, Kenneth Burke, and Jonathan Lim.
