Former S.A. anchor launching own TV show 1 / 3 Back to Gallery It took a while, but a former San Antonio anchorwoman who engaged us for years with her infectious smile and keen nose for news is finally realizing her television dream.\nLongtime WOAI-TV newscaster and original “Living” host Tanji Patton reports that next spring she’ll launch her own 12-episode food, restaurant and wine show throughout Texas, including right here in her hometown.\n“Goodtaste with Tanji,” a half hour created, executive produced and hosted by Patton (with invaluable help from partner and husband Mike), will air Saturday evenings on her old channel, NBC affiliate WOAI, as well as CBS affiliate KEYE in Austin and CBS affiliate KGBT in the Rio Grande Valley (Harlingen, McAllen and Brownsville).\nDebut date, she said, will be April 9.\nIn the meantime, she’s feverishly working on getting the bigger market of Houston into the fold. After all, she’s already familiar to audiences there, thanks to her regular segments on multiple Houston TV affiliates.\nHer goal is to get cleared in every major Texas market, including Dallas. From there, who knows? She may branch out to other U.S. markets, but only if “it continues to be fun,” Patton said.\nAnything seems possible, she pointed out, thanks to national Sysco Foods on board as title sponsor.\nIf some of this TV dream sounds familiar, there’s a reason. Patton’s idea for such a show initially took flight as far back as 2007, the same year she waved goodbye to her station of 17 years, WOAI, and the seat next to anchorman Randy Beamer .\nBy 2008, she had put together a lively trailer, shot in part in Italy’s wine country, that was full of useful info on food, drink and other delights. She shopped it around and got some nice bites, notably from PBS station KLRN. But — alas! — the timing was bad and it didn’t happen.\n“That was the year the market collapsed; the great recession,” she said. “Sponsors that I had lined up went away, marketing money dried up.”\nHowever, she discovered a fresh and more economical way to get her product out there: the Internet.\nHer website, goodtaste.tv, gained momentum relatively quickly, along with strong sponsors, such as H-E-B, and is thriving in its eighth year, she said.\nWhat made her revisit the world of television? It started with a last-minute trip to one of her favorite haunts, San Francisco, she said. “It was Valentine’s weekend and Mike and I wanted to do something special. Flipping around the TV stations there, I caught a show similar to what we were doing. But, as I told Mike, I think we could do it better.\n“That’s what sparked the idea again. We thought, maybe we should take another run at a TV show,” she added. “I’ve always believed there’s no better energy than communication through television.”\nPatton took the idea to the Sinclair Broadcast folks, who already were familiar with her work via the website and segments on WOAI’s “Living” and “Daytime at Nine.” “They suggested we do a pilot. So, we did, and they liked it.”\nShe gave me a peek as well. I found both the execution and content captivating — colorful views of San Antonio and other parts of Texas as well as vivid looks at restaurants, their owners and signature dishes that, believe me, would make anyone salivate.\n“Sure, it’s about the food,” she said. “But my goal also is to find a good story, make an emotional connection with the viewer, give them something so engaging, they’ll set their DVRs so as not to miss it.”\nThe show’s audience? “People who love dining out or cooking. There’s a how-to element for re-creating recipes at home and a wine segment about great finds and deals,” she said.\n“Goodtaste” also is bound to benefit from the charm and vitality of its host, who, in her 50s, comes across as more energetic and playful than many half her age. Workouts and good nutrition help, she said, as does a dependable hairdresser of 15-plus years ( Kim McCarthy , owner of ME Salon) and a young makeup artist in the family ( Charlotte Patton , married to Tanji’s son, Cash).\nAs for it taking this long to turn her TV dream into reality, Patton believes that’s a positive.\n“It’s been an incredible and beneficial route,” she said. “Building this business like we did, we’ve learned so much and gained a wealth of experience. We’ve already conquered digital and social media. So, at this point, chances at success with a TV show look to be pretty darn good.”\nJeanne Jakle ’s column appears Wednesdays and Sundays in mySA, and she blogs at Jakle’s Jacuzzi on mySA.com.
