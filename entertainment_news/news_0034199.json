How would we survive?\nNo pop star has been more visible over the past decade than Swift, who consistently releases albums, performs and dances in the front rows at award shows. But prepare yourself to go without music's biggest star, at least for a little while.\nIn a new interview with British media outlet NME , Swift admits people may be sick of her.\n\"I think people might need a break from me,\" Swift said. \"I'm going to... I don't know. Hang out with my friends. Write new music. Maybe not write new music. I don't know.\"\nSwift says that time could come after her massive 1989 Tour, which runs through the end of the year. The tour came to Cleveland in June .\nSwift has released five albums since 2006. This would mark her first significant break since coming on the scene. You can probably still expect her to Instagram her heart out though.\nvia GIPHY", "external_links": ["http://www.nme.com/news/taylorswift/88890", "http://giphy.com/gifs/taylor-swift-blank-space-soitAQThr9FOU"], "published": "2015-10-09T19:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:17:37.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
