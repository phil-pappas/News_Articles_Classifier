This year’s Fright will take place Oct. 17; 23 and 24; 30 and 31. Tickets are $10, $5 younger than 12; or $12/$7 for express tickets. \nFort Knox, the massive 19th-century granite bastion, is transformed into a series of scenes designed to put a chill into the bravest of living souls. Visitors are guided through the dark, fog-filled, twists and turns of the massive granite fortification where the senses are bombarded by sights, sounds and lights seem to have crawled out of the scariest horror movie. The overall theme of this year’s Fright is about Water Over the Damned. Visitors will come face to face with all manner of things that may have crawled from the water or washed up on the shore. \nFor the first time this year, for those who wish to avoid waiting in Fright lines, express tickets may be purchased online at FrightXtix.com . A food vendor, King’s Concessions, will be available each night for hungry patrons. \nEvent organizers work to ensure that each version of Fright is different from the year before, and they add different elements on each of the four-night run. Those who have not been to Fright before and would like a sense of what the experience may be like are encouraged to visit fortknox.maineguide.com/fright. \nOpening night, Oct. 17, follows al- day Ghostport activities just across the river in neighboring Bucksport, sponsored by the Bucksport Bay Area Chamber of Commerce. Fright at the Fort fireworks may be viewed from the Bucksport waterfront at 9:15 p.m. and will have a music radio-simulcast display sponsored by 93.7 FM, The WAVE. \nProceeds from the Fright event help the Friends of Fort Knox fulfill their mission to restore Fort Knox and enhance its educational, cultural and economic value for the people of Maine.
