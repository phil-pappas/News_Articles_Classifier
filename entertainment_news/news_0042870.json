This collection of bone-chilling audio nightmares will be performed live at the historic Mayne Stage Theatre, 1328 W. Morse Ave, Chicago. Admission is $25 ($20 in advance of Nov 1, $23 for students with identification). \nThis year’s Deathscribe solicitation resulted in submissions of over 100 new works from theatre and horror aficionados around the world. These final five radio plays have emerged, perhaps slightly bloodstained, as finalists of the grueling selection process. Join us to see who will be this year’s victor and winner of the coveted Bloody Axe award! \nThe five finalists will send thrills up your spine as they are brought to life by Chicago’s finest actors and directors, accompanied by a live band and a team of sound effects artists – complete with live foley onstage. The winner of the Bloody Axe will be chosen by a panel of horror and theatre experts. \nDEATHSCRIBE 2015 will present the following five original horror radio plays: \nToo Many Teeth by Axel Arth When a tent revival rolls into town promising cures for all life’s ills, everyone is interested in what Dr. Mordebit is selling, especially the children. But when the good doctor’s intentions become clear, the town may regret their choice. Especially the children. \nEarwigs by Joseph Zettelmaier Sara and Amber have followed their dream and moved into a small cottage in the woods. They soon discover it is infested with vile, crawling things. Fortunately, the little vermin are totally harmless. Right? \nImaginary Fiend by Tim Griffin In this homespun cross-stitch of American terror, a lonely young girl’s innocent wish conjures a bloody bible-belt object-lesson of how a sincere attempt at redemption might be ambushed by long-overdue retribution. \nBack in Baby’s Arms by Travis Williams In the dingy confines of the Blue Moon Motel, on a full moon night, Carly & Ricky try parenting Baby, a child they just kidnapped… But Baby is unlike any child they’ve plucked from God’s green Earth. Oh no, unlike the many before her, Baby is of a special breed. \nBad Things Happen Here by Eric Marlin The dog is by the road. The dog is at the gate. The dog is in the house. Two women stand watch at their door in the nighttime, while two dogmen wait outside. \nThis is a unique and thrilling way to kick off the Holiday season with a night of horrifically alternative entertainment.
