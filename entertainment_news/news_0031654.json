Photo: Ten \nFans were furious after the website published intrusive paparazzo photos of Sam Frost cuddling the winner, Sasha Mielczarek. The pair were captured as they stood inside the window of their hotel room – a place in which they'd have a reasonable expectation of privacy.\nAdvertisement The photos were published at the top of  The Daily Mail's  homepage, with no spoiler warning. The story was soon yanked after Channel Ten won a rare court injunction.\nBut the damage was done. Outraged fans declared on social media that the show had been ruined, and Frost told Kiis FM she was \"absolutely gutted\". (On Friday morning, the website said it would appeal the injunction.)\nSam Frost and Sasha Mielczarek in The Bachelorette Australia 2015 finale. \nThe question is: why on earth did  The Daily Mail  do it?\nWhy choose to spoil the ending of  The Bachelorette  for its fans? Would they dare send a paparazzo to the set of  Game of Thrones , and then publish photos potentially revealing a major plot twist? Oh wait...\nLight entertainment versus an acclaimed drama – it makes no difference. Both series have legions of fans who come along for the ride each week. Journalists get to see these and other programs in advance, so we can have our stories ready to go.\nSam and her boyfriends. \nIf we don't get a preview, some well-placed contacts will fill us in.\nIt seems churlish, though, just to spoil something because you can. (And it feels awful when system glitches or human error result in accidental spoilers, as journos from every Australian media company will attest.)   \nFor Ten, the stakes are much higher. The network's frantic court action was prompted by a very obvious motivator: money.  \nSasha whipping up a napkin rose for Sam Frost. Photo: Ten \nThe Bachelorette  has been one of Ten's highest-rating shows this year. With its overt product placement, huge social media presence and strong ratings, it's a cash cow. All successful reality shows are.\nOf course, this has no bearing on the stories journalists choose to write. But it does explain why the networks go to such extreme lengths to protect their shows.\nBefore I could preview  The Bachelorette  finale, I had to sign a contract allowing Ten to sell my organs on the black market, patent my DNA and keep my firstborn child if I ruined their show.\nBachelorette contestant Michael Turnbull with Sam Frost. Photo: Supplied \nMy Kitchen Rules  – this country's top-rating program four years running – shoots two alternate endings to prevent spoilers. The producers tell one team they've won the entire series, dump a bag of glitter on them, give them a trophy, and film them whooping and crying and hugging. Then someone yells, \"Cut!\", and they sweep up the mess and repeat the whole thing with the other team.\nThe amazing thing is that neither team knows who won until they watch the episode go to air with the rest of the country.\nAnother reality show, whose fans are just as obsessive as  The Bachelorette's , has a policy of not letting reporters on set. \"We don't want you to know our secrets,\" the producer told me.\nThe show has been a ratings hit for Ten. \nI've also observed packed auctions on  The Block . There must have been at least a hundred people crammed into each apartment. Yet no one leaked the results because … well, why would you want to be the grown-up equivalent of that grade five boy who runs around telling the prep kids that Santa isn't real? Just because you can ruin the things other people find fun, it doesn't mean you must.\nGiven Ten's struggles over the past few years, their eagerness to protect a successful show is no surprise. The \"winner announcement\" segment of  The Bachelorette  finale drew 1.92 million viewers in the city and regional areas, with 1.55 million watching the rest of the episode. It's impossible to know if more people might have tuned in had  The Daily Mail  spoiler not run – and if so, how many.\nAs Ten and  The Daily Mail  duke it out, it's worth knowing the context.\nSarah Harris hits back at Daily Mail photos. \nThe Daily Mail  is a partner of Ten's rival, Nine. According to some sources, relations are often \"strained\" between Ten and the website.  \nIn particular, Ten has not been impressed by the  Mail's  photographers trailing its stars as they go about their chores.\nBondi Vet 's Chris Brown, for instance, was snapped near the beach \"trying to go incognito\", as the accompanying story alleged.  Studio 10 's Sarah Harris was caught unawares while trying on her wedding dress in a boutique. And Offspring's Asher Keddie was put under surveillance while taking a break in Perth. The masthead ran photos of her having a cigarette with her husband, describing her as \"makeup free\" for some reason. She was standing in a park during this brazenly makeup-free outing – a park that looked peaceful in the photographs, but which the Mail called \"desolate\". For good measure, they added that her baby \"was nowhere to be seen\" – something media outlets tend not to notice when fathers leave the house without their babies. \nIn the end, it all comes down money. Not just for Ten, but for the  Mail , too. Intrusive photos are its stock-in-trade. Its readership has grown strongly since its UK parent company launched a local website. There is clearly a demand (among some people at least), for this stuff.\nThe  Mail  went to great lengths to get their photos of Sam and Sasha inside their hotel room, and they want them back.\nIf the fledgling masthead wants to spoil top-rating reality TV shows, it has every right to. (Provided it operates within the law, naturally.) But why stop at reality TV? Why not publish the plot twists of every critically-acclaimed drama without warning readers? Why not divulge the endings of new-release movies and novels?\nSome of the commentary today has a whiff of \"who cares, it's only reality TV?\" about it. It'd be interesting to see how these commentators would react if you blabbed the climax of their subtitled Danish box-set crime series before they  reached the last episode. People are allowed to enjoy their diversions, however light-hearted or pointless.\nAnd it'll be interesting to see how The Daily Mail fares if they keep this up.\nTwitter:  @Michael_Lallo \nmlallo@fairfaxmedia.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T11:20:54.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
