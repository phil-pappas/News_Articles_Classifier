He turned down an offer to make an appearance. \n\"I hope it's terrific,\" he tells The Hollywood Reporter . \"But it just makes no sense to me. Why would I do just one day of shooting on something I did 30 years ago?\" \nMoranis, who went on an extended hiatus from acting following the death of his wife Ann in 1997 to focus on raising their two children, says he's \"picky\" about the projects he chooses to work on. \"Picky has worked for me,\" he adds. \nAside from Ghostbusters , Moranis' credits include Honey, I Shrunk the Kids ; The Flintstones ; Little Shop of Horrors ; and Strange Brew . \nKristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon will star in the new Ghostbusters , which will open next July. \nCopyright © 2015,  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:35:04.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
