Photo: Nine \nEvery week for the past 152 weeks, Channel Nine's news in Sydney has had a bigger audience than Channel Seven's news (and every other news).\nNine's dominance began a matter of months after the arrival of Peter Overton as its presenter. Asked if that is a coincidence, Peter Overton becomes uncomfortable. Like any good journalist, he prefers to leave himself out of the story.\n\"It's hard to talk about yourself in that way,\" he says.\nChannel Seven says it's fighting back. 'It's a marathon, not a sprint,' says Rob Raschke. Photo: Bloomberg \n\"It was January 2009 when I went in and we were getting beaten pretty handsomely. But we had a very positive attitude, I suppose an attitude of, 'We've got nothing to lose', and we went back to our core values of news as giving the daily record of the day.\nAdvertisement \"We went back to the basics, reinforcing what had been such a strong news brand with Brian Henderson and Jim Waley. Over time, I think a bit quicker than we'd anticipated, we found the viewers liked what we were doing.\"\nSo it was a return to \"core journalistic values\" that put Nine on top. And that's exactly what Seven says it's doing to seize the crown back from Nine, slowly but surely.\nEvery week for the past 152 weeks, Channel Nine's news in Sydney has had a bigger audience than Channel Seven's news Photo: Joe Armao \n\"It's a marathon, not a sprint,\" says Seven's news director, Rob Raschke, when asked about Seven's plan.\n\"There's nothing you can do in terms of stunts or gimmicks that are going to change that. We are confident we are making inroads. It's about making sure that when the big stories happen, we cover them better than anybody else, the best pictures, getting them to air very quickly and accurately.\n\"It's about making sure you are relevant, and entertaining. If people are going to give you an hour of their time, you don't want to waste their time.\nSeven newsreader Mark Ferguson is intensely involved in the news-gathering process, says his news director. Photo: Supplied \n\"They should walk away from it feeling they've got everything they need to know.\"\nSeven says it employs more than 600 people across Australia on news and public affairs programs – a growth of about 20 per cent in 10 years. Nine declined to give details on staff numbers or resources.\nSo is Seven devoting more resources than Nine to newsgathering?\nSeven's News has a 'back to basics' focus on newsgathering. Photo: Seven News \n\"I don't want to sit here and kick my opposition,\" Raschke says. \"I've got a healthy respect for them. They do a very good job. The quality of television news in this country is very, very high. I don't want to spend my time disparaging them at all. I'm also determined to knock them off.\"\nSo if Seven and Nine are equal in terms of their \"back to basics\" approach to newsgathering, it must be something about the presenter that pulls more viewers to Nine. Time to make Overton uncomfortable again. Under pressure, he speculates that viewers may be responding to the obvious fact that he loves his work.\n\"I am who you see on-screen, I'm a very family-oriented, community-oriented bloke,\" Overton says.\nViewers liked what Nine News was doing, says Peter Overton. Photo: Nine News \n\"Hopefully viewers are comfortable with that, and it seems to have bedded in. I'm a journalist first and foremost. I have an economics degree from Macquarie University. I had eight years reporting on 60 Minutes , I had 10 years as a reporter in the news room before that. And I very much have a voice at the table. I sit at the production desk. I certainly when necessary will express my opinion about, 'Why are we leading with that, what about this?'\n\"I'm very much involved in the daily grind of the news and the direction the news is taking. Otherwise I wouldn't do the job, to be honest. I wouldn't want to just sit there and read the news.\n\"The other day, when Turnbull took on the leadership, Laurie Oakes and I spent 50 minutes treading water without a commercial break waiting for him to speak. It was fantastic, we had a ball taking about politics, pedalling as we waited. That's what satiates you every day.\"\nSeven's Raschke says Mark Ferguson is also intensely involved in the news-gathering process, and has earned the trust of viewers because of his journalistic experience: \"He has very strong views about the bulletin and he's very engaged, as he should be.\"\nRaschke also was full of praise for the news gathering skills of Mel Doyle, who moved to news last year from Sunrise . Would he consider making her a joint presenter with Mark Ferguson – a common formula in the US and the standard set-up in Perth, where Seven's news consistently beats Nine's?\n\"What we have in Sydney has traditionally been a single newsreader at prime time, I think that works very, very well,\" Raschke says.\n\"Other markets are more comfortable with a double-header. This has a long, long tradition and people seem to like it. You don't make radical changes in news. You tinker at your peril.\n\"We have the most credentialed, the most experienced team of news reporters in this city. You've got to believe the story that's being told to you, and that's more than the newsreader.\"\nNine's news and Seven's news both start at 6pm nightly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:33:19.081+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
