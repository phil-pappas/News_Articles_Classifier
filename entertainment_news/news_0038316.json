Sanjjanaa's cameo in the upcoming film Ring Road is one such. \"Ravindra (the producer) is a good friend who often advises me on both professional and personal matters. When he called to tell me that he required me to work for a week, I did not even ask him what the role was about. Incidentally, there is no film that he will do without me in it and I trust him to give me characters that make an impact,\" says Sanjjanaa, who was part of Ravindra's last directorial, Mathe Banni Preethsona.\nAdd to that the fact that this is one of the rare films that signifies women power at various levels. \"The entire technical team has only women and I feel lucky to be a part of such a venture. The director, Priya Belliappa, herself is a superwoman,\" says the actress. About her role in it, she says, \"I can tell you that I play the sort of woman who explores and explains different dimensions of life and is a hardcore feminist.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:00:16.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
