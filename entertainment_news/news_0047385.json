I truly appreciate everyone's support,\" he added.\nScaling Everest has been all but abandoned this season following April's earthquake, which killed nearly 8,900 people and devastated large parts of Nepal, including the capital Kathmandu.\nIt is the second spring season with virtually no one reaching the summit after an avalanche in 2014 killed 16 Nepali guides and also sparked a shutdown.\nMountaineers usually begin their summit attempts late at night, which allows them to descend in daylight, lowering the risk of them falling to their deaths due to exhaustion.\nMountaineering experts say climbing in autumn is more dangerous than spring due to high winds and lower temperatures.\nKuriki, who planned to summit alone without the aid of bottled oxygen, was forced to abandon a bid last month because deep snow made it difficult for him to climb quickly during the final stretch.\nMountaineering is a major revenue-earner for impoverished Nepal, home to eight of the world's 14 peaks over 8,000 meters, but the April 25 earthquake has raised fears for its tourism industry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T18:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:58:39.493+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
