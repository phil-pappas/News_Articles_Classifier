Set the Tigers Free\n2. Everything I Am is Yours\n3. My Lighthouse\n4. Courage\n5. That Day\n6. The Soul Serene\n7. Memoir\n8. Hot Scary Summer\n9. The Waves\n10. Darling Arithmetic\n11. So Naive\n12. Wichita Lineman\nThey'll also play Vicar Street on January 8th . Tickets are €28 including booking fee, and on sale from usual outlets this Friday at 10am.\n[UPDATE: They'll play several other Irish dates in January, too - details below]\n26 January : – Belfast - ‘Out to Lunch Festival' - The MAC Theatre\n29 January : – Galway - Black Box\n30 January : – Cork – Savoy\nMORE: Watch: Villagers share video for new single 'Hot Scary Summer'\nMORE: Conor O'Brien of Villagers joins line-up for David Lynch-themed concert at the NCH in November\nMORE: Jape announce gig at Vicar Street in December", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/wJDqHpZUh_c"], "published": "2015-10-19T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:30:10.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
