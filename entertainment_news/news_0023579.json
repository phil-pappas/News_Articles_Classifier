In the top of the inning, Texas' Rougned Odor scored the go-ahead run with two outs when Blue Jays catcher Russell Martin's throw back to the mound hit batter Shin-Soo Choo, and the ball rolled up the third-base line. Fans pelted the field with debris during an 18-minute delay. \nIn the bottom of the inning, the Rangers committed three straight errors to help Toronto tie the score, and Jose Bautista hit a three-run homer, complete with an emphatic bat flip, for a 6-3 lead. \nBenches cleared twice during the half-inning. Toronto advanced to face the Royals in the ALCS, which starts Friday night on Fox. Rate this This article has not yet been rated. We want you to tell us what you think of our articles.
