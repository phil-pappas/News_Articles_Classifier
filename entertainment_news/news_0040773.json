A dozen or so years later, they meet again while bailing out of a sex addicts meeting. Neither of them is a sex addict, but they do have their problems.\nJake drifts from casual fling to casual fling, never staying very long with the same woman. Lainey, meanwhile, has just left a longtime relationship after confessing to cheating on her boyfriend with Matthew (Adam Scott), a gynecologist she’s had a thing for since college.\nJake and Lainey go out on a date so casual Jake doesn’t even realize it’s a date. They find themselves remarkably at ease talking about sex and relationships and their own problems. The banter — and this is a film very much built on banter — is relaxed, yet revealing. At the end of the night, even though there’s plenty of sexual attraction, they decide to keep things platonic.\nAnd platonic they stay as Lainey and Jake become best friends. Jake is still a serial dater, Lainey still pines for Matthew, but on they go, talking explicitly while keeping their distance. Everyone they know thinks they should be together, but they fear ruining their friendship by falling in love.\nWriter-director Leslye Headland offers a dialogue-driven dissection of modern love filled with enough insecurity to power a Woody Allen film. Brie, equal parts adorable and alluring, brings a lot to the party, but it’s Sudeikis, brimming with casual charisma, who gives the film its real spark. His fast-talking Jake shows deceptive depth between the punch lines, as well as disarming vulnerability. It’s the kind of performance that makes you wonder how much more Sudeikis has in him.\ntlong@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/toomuchTomLong \n\n‘Sleeping with Other People’ \nGRADE: B \nRated R for strong sexual content, language including sexual references, and some drug use\nRunning time: 101 minutes", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:23:28.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
