With scant interviews, and hardly any words from Greenwood, \"Junun\" instead captures the musicians in full thrall, recording in a hilltop fort in between occasional power outages.\n\"Junun\" will be released on the movie subscription platform MUBI on Friday. Anderson shot it digitally, occasionally even experimenting with drones.\nGreenwood has scored Anderson's last three films: \"There Will Be Blood,\" ''The Master\" and \"Inherent Vice.\"\nArts & Entertainment Media Paul Thomas Anderson Johnny Greenwood Shye Ben Tzur", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:49:56.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
