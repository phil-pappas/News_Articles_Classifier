On Saturday, October 10, Steven sent a cease and desist letter to the Republican presidential candidate, demanding him to stop using the band's song at campaign events. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the letter was actually the second time Donald has been warned about using \"Dream On\". The former \" The Apprentice \" host was first told to not use the song after an event in Mobile, Alabama on August 21. Most recently, Donald's camp played the song at a rally in Georgia. \"Trump for President does not have our client's permission to use 'Dream On' or any of our client's other music in connection with the Campaign because it gives the false impression that he is connected with or endorses Mr. Trump's presidential bid,\" the letter read. \"We are unaware of any public performance license granting Trump for President the right to perform 'Dream On' in connection with the Campaign.If Trump for President has any such license, please forward it to our attention immediately.\" Donald was given 24 hours to acknowledge receipt of the letter. \"If Trump for President does not comply with our demands, our client will be forced to pursue any and all legal or equitable remedies which our client may have against you,\" the legal warning added. Steven's lawyer Dina LaPolt said in a statement, \"This is not a political nor personal issue with Mr. Trump. Steven works tirelessly with both Republicans and Democrats regarding copyright reform and his position has always been consistent regarding copyright and intellectual property. Simply, one must get permission from the music creators. Steven wrote 100% of 'Dream On,' and this is about the un-authorized use of his property. Steven is a registered Republican.\" Last year, Donald went to an Aerosmith concert and tweeted, \"Doesn't get any better than that! @IamStevenT was fantastic, great energy!\" In August, Steven attended the Republican debate as a personal guest of Donald. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Browse Steven Tyler Pictures More Steven Tyler News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T02:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:40:27.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
