The daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore debuted her new hair color when making the press rounds to \"Extra\" and the \" Today \" show on Thursday, October 15, to promote her musical \"Chicago\". Rumer was photographed that day wearing her new lighter locks brushed back with a gold bird hair clip. The 27-year-old beauty also wore a grey sweater dress and matching coat when she was snapped heading to the \"Today\" show in New York City. Rumer made her Broadway debut last month, and her entire family, including sisters Scout, 24, and Tallulah 21, was in attendance to lend their support. Last month she shared to E! News that she's so thankful to have the support from her family. \"It was so wonderful. I mean, they're amazing and they're so supportive of me,\" she was quoted as saying. \"I think that they know this has been a dream of mine-to be on Broadway since I was a little kid. So it was amazing not just for me, but for them to see me do something I've wanted to do for so long.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:24:34.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
