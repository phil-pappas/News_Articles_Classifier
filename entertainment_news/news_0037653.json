As you can imagine, it was incredible. At one point, Miranda sat on a throne made of men, presumably none of whom were allowed to ride in her little red wagon. Later, Miranda tweeted that Taylor is an inspiring \"badass\" and her show was \"amazing,\" all of which is correct. In a dream world, they'd continue this collaboration by recording a \"Somethin' Bad\"-style duet together. What do you say, Tayranda? (That's their new BFF ship name, obviously.)\nMore From Cosmopolitan This is a video of @mirandalambert sitting on a throne of men at #1989TourGreensboro ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ pic.twitter.com/unV6FvYD7q\nâ€” Taylor Swift (@taylorswift13) October 22, 2015\nh\nA\n@mirandalambert\n#1989TourGreensboro pic.twitter.com/KVyAvsj2uW\nâ€” Taylor Swift (@taylorswift13) October 22, 2015\n@taylorswift13 ....
