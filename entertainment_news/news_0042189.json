The variety of dot-to-dot styles are a great teaching tool for kids, letting them have fun while they learn, and adults and seniors will love it because it is a fun stress reliever that also keeps the brain active.\nIn the Greatest Dots app there are six different styles of doing a dot-to-dot puzzle. Each puzzle is direct from the pages of the Greatest Newspaper Dot-to-Dot book series by David Kalvitis (except for 2 new hidden bonus puzzles). Use your finger like a pen to draw crisp clean lines between numbered dots. Each line drawn snaps to the dots with a satisfying click and straightens your line for the most precisely detailed rendering possible. You will create artistic pictures covering a broad subject range, adding to the surprise element. Each final image is a small treasure, beautifully drawn and charming. Collect pen colors and paper colors for unique and colorful combinations. A nostalgic relaxing pastime finally done right for iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch users of all ages.\nThe Greatest Dots app is available for FREE in the Apple App Store, with in-app purchases.\nTo join the revolution please visit http://www.MonkeyingAround.com for more Greatest Dots information, screen shots, videos and challenging dot-to-dots.\nIn 2000, Monkeying Around started a dot-to-dot revolution, producing award-winning dot-to-dot puzzles.
