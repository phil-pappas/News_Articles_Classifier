The material seems custom-built for the charming and affable pop singer with the strikingly dramatic voice.\n\"These songs are meant to be sung over and over again by many different interpreters,\" he says. \"It's great to keep carrying that torch a little bit.\"\nThe 13 tracks on \"Stages\" feature such emotional classics as \"What I Did For Love\" from \"A Chorus Line\" and \"Try to Remember\" from \"The Fantasticks.\" Also included is material by composers Stephen Sondheim, Rodgers & Hammerstein and Andrew Lloyd Webber. Groban is the right singer to revisit such notable material. His smooth, sweeping and classically trained voice puts him in the lineage of beloved pop crooners Johnny Mathis and Andy Williams.\nGroban called recently from New York to discuss his love of acting and offer advice on how to be a better singer. This is an edited transcript.\nQ: When you were young your first dream was to be an actor. When did you realize you had a gift for singing?\nA: I wanted to be an actor because it was way easier for me to have a mask than to not have a mask. I was a shy kid. I was awkward. I was picked on. When I fell into a character, I got to not be me. I played someone else. I got to pretend to have a certain confidence that I normally didn't have. Acting gave me the freedom to do that. Ironically enough, singing was the more vulnerable thing. That was showing off the nakedness. Singing was always in me, but the acting felt safer for a good long time. The fact that the singing wound up coming to the forefront was a direct result of having an arts foundation and having great teachers who pulled me out of my shell.\nQ: You've done a number of memorable television roles as an actor. You played Andy's brother on \"The Office\" and Dee's fantasy man on \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.\" You have excellent comic timing. Where did you get that?\nA: That was something I developed early on. Comedy and music are so similar because it's all about timing. I did improv in junior high school. Figuring out my comedic timing helped my confidence in talking to the bullies and talking to people in class. If I could make them laugh, then I was in, I was OK. Early on when my music became so super serious and the songs became so very dramatic, I almost felt it was off-brand to show my silly comedic side. In the last six or seven years it's been so much fun to have some cameos and even spoof myself a little bit. It's something I really value now as a part of the whole picture.\nQ: When you were deciding on what show tunes to include on \"Stages,\" how big was your original wish list of potential covers?\nA: It was huge. In many ways tackling an album like this was more difficult than doing an original music album because suddenly you're diving into an endless canon of music. You think about what your favorites are. People working on the project put in their favorites. Before you know it you have 100 songs to demo.\nQ: What criteria did you use to narrow it down?\nA. A couple of things had to come into play. For me, personal experience had a lot to do with it. Songs and shows that were an influential part of my artistic development. Shows I grew up with. Shows I was in when I was in high school. Songs that were full circle for me.\nQ: You cover several songs by Stephen Sondheim. What makes his work so attractive to perform?\nA: I first started listening to Sondheim's work when I was a kid. My parents brought home a video of (the Sondheim musical) \"Sunday in the Park with George.\" At that age I didn't understand what all the lyrics meant, all the love and loss. But there was something about his chords and the way he wrote melodies that moved me. As I got older it became clear to me that he dares the listener to think deeper than just the big line or the big melody. He can certainly write those, but he takes the grand emotion, the universal feelings that we all have, and he chooses challenging and unexpected ways to tell the stories of those emotions. He dares to go there. There's a melancholy to the way he writes that I really like. As an interpreter it's great to sing his work.\nQ: I've seen a lot of discussion about your voice. How do you describe your vocal range?\nA: Well, I would describe it differently at 7 in the morning than I would at 10 at night. (laughs) But I'm a lyric baritone. That's probably the most accurate description of my vocal range. That said, I can pop out higher tenor notes when I feel it's right for the song. I have those up my sleeve as well. Throughout the course of my career, people have put my voice in one category or another. I've felt very lucky that to my fans, people are thinking, 'Oh, that's Josh.'\nQ: What advice would you give someone who wants to become a better singer?\nA: Vocal training and vocal health are paramount. Having a teacher that you trust is really important. You need to make sure you have the training that gives you the empowerment to go out there and kill it every night. It's also important not to imitate. One of the challenges I had in junior high school was I loved listening to singers so much that my voice was uncannily able to mimic. I could sing anything. I could go to karaoke and sing Queen. I could be Pavarotti. I could do so much with my voice and that helped me with the comedy too. But it took me a minute to figure out what my voice was. The important thing for a singer is to not listen at the door of what everyone else is doing. Express yourself in a way that is right for your voice. The main thing is to tell stories that you're passionate about. I go by the goose bump test. If I hear something and it makes me feel something, somebody else will feel it too.\n(c)2015 Chicago Tribune\nVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1740258&h=Josh+Groban+tackling+classic+tunes+on+%27Stages%27", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1740258&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1740258"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:15:33.846+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
