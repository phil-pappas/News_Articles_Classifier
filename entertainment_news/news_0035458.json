Taking aim at pharmaceutical companies promising miracle cures, the show adds thought-provoking intrigue with a dash of horror.\nThere are bumps in the storytelling in the script by Michael Federico and Jeffrey Schmidt. At the same time, they succeed in creating a cautionary tale in a hypnotically designed futuristic world, where a cabbie’s arm can be scanned by a passenger who wants to call him later and everyone waves illuminated keyboard-less devices that work like voice-activated cellphones.\nDr. John Faust, persuasively portrayed as a Type A personality by Cameron Cobb, is a chemist who comes up with a wonder drug that helps people heal themselves from previously hopeless conditions. In exchange for his soul, Mephistopheles (Lydia Mackay, slinking seductively and controllingly with black fishnets on her arms and legs) offers him success with his compound and with Gretchen (an appealingly vulnerable Chandler Ryan), the woman of his dreams.\nFaust’s messianic belief that his compound will save the world and that ends justify means gives this old tale a fresh spin. What’s lacking is a strong counter character to the devil to provide tension as Faust slips toward his fate. Instead, what we get are characters using rote prayers to ward off evil, crossed with a little Jekyll & Hyde action when Faust tests his drug on himself.\nUnder Schmidt’s direction, an intense cast, with featured roles by John M. Flores, Andrews Cope, Drew Wall and Whitney Holotik, keeps the energy throbbing in a world where dark walls artfully shift to change scenes in the set designed and smokily lighted by Amanda West. Suggestive costumes by Korey Kent and rocking choreography by Zenobia Taylor, danced to the beat of Tim O’Heir’s sound design, add to the heat. The show contains adult language, adult situations and, best of all, plenty of adult conversation-starters.\nPlan your life\nContinues through Oct. 24.
