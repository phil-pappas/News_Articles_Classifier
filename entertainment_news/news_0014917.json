(Photo: John Phillips, Getty Images for BFI) \nSo sorry, Cumberbleeps! Double-\"o\"-nada is how Benedict Cumberbatch quantified his chances of being considered for the role of Bond, James Bond. While walking the carpet for the premiere of Black Mass , Cumberbatch told The Guardian : \n\"I don't think they'd consider me for Bond to be honest. I don't know. I can wear a suit, yeah. I can do that. And I can fight. Yeah, I could raise my eyebrow, but that's not what it takes to play Bond.\" \nThe actor did admit that he'd find playing the part rather enjoyable. \n\"It would be fun though, wouldn't it?\" \nGuess it depends on who you ask.
