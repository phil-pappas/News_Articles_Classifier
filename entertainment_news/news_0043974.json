The sibling duo announced Thursday that they’ll continue their residency at Flamingo through at least 2016 and probably beyond, then came word that they will be immortalized at Madame Tussauds at the Venetian, the first figures in the New Year. \nThe brother-and-sister singers have been involved with their wax lookalikes since the inception. Their sitting took more than three hours per person, with the studio team taking approximately 300 measurements. Their measurements have been used to sculpt their figures in clay by hand, then covered in a plaster cast. The clay was removed from the casts and poured in and allowed to cool. Launch slideshow » \nThe next few weeks will be spent meticulously inserting each hair by hand, which is customary for the Madame Tussauds studio team. Finally, the figures will be fitted with acrylic eyes and teeth, while countless layers of tinted paint will be applied to build up skin tones and replicate their faces. \nWe’ll get the first photos from the sittings here at Vegas DeLuxe in early November. Donny & Marie resumed at the Flamingo on Thursday night through Nov. 14 before setting out on their Christmas tour, then solo shows before returning here in February. \nMR. CHOW ARRIVES: It’s official that the seventh restaurant for global dining legend Mr. Chow will open at Caesars Palace in December. I dined at Michael Chow ’s original in London in 1968 and the two he opened in New York. He went on to open in Miami, Malibu and Beverly Hills, as well. \nKnown primarily for expensive menu items and celebrity clientele, Michael is the master who brought Beijing duck, green prawns and hand-pulled noodles to the dining scene. The second-story restaurant overlooking Garden of the Gods will seat more than 250 guests. \nThe recipe for his all-time favorite “fried seaweed” on the menu as “Gambei” is still kept secret to this day, but I can tell you that it’s not dug up from the sea as popular myth has it! In fact, it’s fresh collard greens fried in peanut oil, then sliced and diced. I’m betting that once you eat Michael’s duck in the thin, tiny, tortilla-like pancake wrappers, you’ll be sold for life. \nCONGRATULATIONS: The Oasis at Gold Spike downtown celebrated its first anniversary Thursday. Owned and operated by Downtown Project, the boutique hotel was opened after a multimillion-dollar renovation last year.

Body English \nThough masculine in lines and furnishings, there are sensuous feminine touches to be found within Body English's black leather upholstered walls and oversized booths. \nGuests walk down a long flight of stairs which leads to the main entrance of the club. The first focal point that catches the eye is a larger-than-life million dollar, color-changing crystal chandelier that hangs over the main dance floor, offering a touch of elegance while simultaneously offering just enough lighting to create an intimate ambiance. \nAround the perimeter of the upstairs level are the main bar and a number of VIP godfather booths, ideal for elite groups. On the main dance floor, additional VIP booths made of elegant black leather circle the room, giving guests the best view of all the action. Complete with its own DJ booth, bar and waitress staff, the room known as The Parlor, which is adjacent to the main dance floor, also offers an intimate experience for separate parties. 4455 Paradise Road Las Vegas , NV 89169 702-693-4000 Hard Rock Hotel & Casino \nArguably one the coolest joints in town, the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino houses some of Vegas' best entertainment, restaurants and nightlife. \nAt Hard Rock, it's all about the music. From the light fixtures made out of drum cymbals and guitar shaped door handles to stage costumes and tools of the trade of legendary musicians displayed on the walls, the hotel screams rock and roll. The Hard Rock's Joint has hosted some the biggest names in music — from The Who to Bob Dylan to hometown heroes, The Killers. Aside from the music venues, the pool at the Hard Rock is one of its biggest attractions. Spread out over 4.7 acres, the pool area features swim-up blackjack, a bar and grill, private cabanas, a bevy of secluded nooks, a waterfall and an extensive live music venue with a dance floor. During the summer, the pool transforms into the Rehab club on Sunday afternoons.\nThe resident nightclub Body English fuses European elegance with a rock star bachelor pad and it often a hot spot for visiting celebs and popular DJs. Vintage rock memorabilia lines the walls at Wasted Space, Hard Rock's anti-club. \nRestaurants at Hard Rock are just as hip as the rest of the casino. Pink Taco serves up Mexican dishes, as well as a Central American and Caribbean menu. Nobu, one of five worldwide Japanese-specialty restaurants from famed Nobu Matsuhisa, satisfies a different taste. For round-the-clock cuisine, Mr. Lucky's 24/7, is sure to ease your appetite even after a Vegas-all-nighter. 4455 Paradise Road Las Vegas , NV 89169 702-693-5000", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T10:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T12:01:28.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
