By Andrew Gilbert Posted: 10/05/2015 12:00:00 PM PDT Updated: 10/05/2015 12:20:23 PM PDT In fall 2007, Cal Performances celebrated the vast, varied and always vivid world of choreographer Twyla Tharp with an unprecedented six-week retrospective, which encompassed her journey from the 1960s avant garde to the realms of Broadway and Hollywood while paying particular attention to the modern jazz insurrection she brought to Joffrey Ballet and the American Ballet Theatre. \nFor this year's 50th anniversary tour -- which marks a half century since the 1965 premiere of her radically stripped down dance \"Tank Dive\" in room 1604 of the Hunter College Art Department -- Tharp wasn't interested in looking back at past triumphs or revisiting unheralded experiments. \n\"I really wanted to do something new,\" says the choreographer by phone, after rehearsing the cadre of dancers she has recruited for the widely anticipated national tour, which touches down Oct. 16-18 at Berkeley's Zellerbach Hall. (Tharp has stoked anticipation with a fascinating New York Times blog series.) Two new works Which isn't to say she was looking to reinvent \"The Catherine Wheel\" (her 1981 collaboration with Talking Heads' David Byrne). But instead of lighting out in an entirely new direction, she turned to music near and dear to her art, creating two new dances representing the polar Apollonian and Dionysian impulses that have long defined her art, for the tour. Advertisement \nIn \"Yowzie,\" Tharp revisits the rollicking, irreverent and playfully bawdy jazz of Jelly Roll Morton and Fats Waller. With \"Preludes and Fugues,\" she turns to J. S. Bach's sublimely ordered staple, \"The Well-Tempered Clavier.\" \nTharp first made her mark creating dances without any muscial accompaniment, but when she decided in the early 1970s that \"we've earned music,\" she felt \"it would make sense to start not with Bach but with American music.\" \nWhen searching for early expressions of authentically original American music, she found that in 1971, \"recordings of Scott Joplin's ragtime didn't really exist yet. But I got hold of Jelly Roll Morton's Red Hot Peppers recordings, and they have enormous musical sophistication. The music is so full of life and has a great sense of humor, and we built on that.\" \nRather than going back to the original 1920s and '30s recordings, Tharp set \"Yowzie\" to Morton and Waller compositions as interpreted by The Hot Nine, a recent project led by powerhouse New Orleans pianist Henry Butler and slide trumpeter Steven Bernstein. Both were part of the first great generation of improvisers to emerge from Berkeley High's jazz program in the mid-1970s. Bay Area connection That's not the only connection linking Tharp's tour to the Bay Area. Two of her eight dancers hail from this region. Los Altos-raised Reed Tankersley caught Tharp's eye when he performed in her classic piece \"Baker's Dozen\" as part of Juilliard Dances Repertory in 2014. The recent Juilliard grad is the youngest dancer on the tour, which \"doesn't seem like that big of a deal,\" he says, though \"I keep hearing it. I think that Twyla Tharp says it a lot.\" \nTankersley, who graduated from Mountain View High in 2010, finds both of her new dances quite challenging in entirely different ways. Where \"Preludes and Fugues\" is \"very demanding in a technical sense, the second piece is very character driven,\" he says. \"The movement is almost secondary. The story and character are almost more important.\" \nBerkeley-raised dancer Ramona Kelley agrees that \"Yowzie\" and \"Preludes and Fugues\" demand very different skill sets. The daughter of highly regarded dance teacher Wendy Diamond and a regular with Oakland Ballet, Kelley entered Tharp's orbit in a touring production of \"Come Fly Away,\" her Broadway dance revue based on the music of Frank Sinatra. \n\"Preludes and Fugues\" is \"more classical, the world as it should be. And 'Yowzie' is the world as it is,\" Kelley says, which makes it more of a challenge. \"We talk a lot about how it's much harder to play the comic side than the serious side. Twyla says that laughing and having fun and being silly -- the body enjoying itself -- that's not as common in our culture, and it's not our training as dancers. She says we're dancers and an acting troupe as well.\" Opposing forces In many ways, the current tour distills the dualities that Tharp has long explored. The elegant precision of \"Preludes and Fugues\" and the earthy, messy humanity of \"Yowzie\" bring to mind her similarly divergent \"Nine Sinatra Songs\" and \"Bad Smells,\" a charged pairing that pits idealized romance against alienation and despair. \n\"I have often looked at opposed visions of the world, and you could say these dances represent the sacred and vernacular,\" Tharp says. \"You can't not deal with the world as it ought to be. Finding that kind of righteous order is a special challenge. It's always been one of the privileges and challenges of my work to cover as many bases, structures, and purposes as I can. Ultimately, these are two ends of the spectrum, that's who we are.\" \nIn addition to the performances, Tharp's Berkeley visit includes a talk, followed by a signing of her latest book, 2013's \"The Collaborative Habit: Life Lessons for Working Together\" (3 p.m. Oct. 17, at Berkeley's Wheeler Auditorium), and a community dance class led by an artist from Tharp's company, teaching choreographic phrases from the current works (11 a.m. Oct 17 at Bancroft Studio). Advance registration at the Cal Performances website, calperformances.org , is highly recommended for each. \nThe Berkeley tour stop, presented by Cal Performances, is part of the inaugural Berkeley RADICAL season's ZellerBACH programming. (These programs also include the Baroque chamber orchestra and choir known as the Bach Collegium Japan, directed by Masaaki Suzuki, performing Oct. 24 at Berkeley's First Congregational Church; and violinist Gil Shaham playing Bach's complete Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin, April 14, 2016, at Zellerbach Hall).
