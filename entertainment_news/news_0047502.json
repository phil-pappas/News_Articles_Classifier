An overwhelming, forceful climax also is in store, as usual.\nThe smooth narrative is driven by wise-cracking dialogue. The type of hidden evil doesn’t begin to emerge until nearly two-thirds of the way through the 402-page book. Readers may learn something new about the existence of an aspect of daily modern life, but saying what that is would be a spoiler.\nLongtime Child fans may have noticed that Reacher, as a character, never changes or grows within each book — or from book to book.\nHe’s the same tough guy with a keen sense of justice and a winning way with women that he was in the first novel, “Killing Floor,” to the 19th, “Personal.”\nIn “Make Me,” hints appear that Reacher may be changing.\nThe cumulative physical altercations over the years are starting to take their toll. Reacher is not well at the end of “Make Me,” a turn of events that may factor into future stories.\ndhendricks@express-news.net", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/15/53/8706801/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/15/53/8706801/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-03T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:30:40.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
