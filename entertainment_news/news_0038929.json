The time of year may also explained why the proliferation of white gowns at the Irish Film and Television Awards (the winners of which you can see here ) was rife... Host Caroline Morahan got the ball rolling in this Armani off-the-shoulder number...\nAoibhinn Garrihy (she used to be on Fair City) and Mary Murray from Love/Hate and also opted for a classic white guna...\nWhile Aisling Franciosi from The Fall shook things up a bit in a white trouser suit (The Kooples) - which are all the rage this year, don't you know.\nThen there was the 'off-white' brigade, championed by Amy Huberman (in Alex Perry) and Collete Fitzpatrick, among others...\nAs expected, red also featured heavily, coming clad on the likes of Sinead Desmond, Glenda Gilson, and Aisling O'Loughlin...\nMoving on, looking simply sublime in a vintage powder blue frock Grace Kelly would've bitten her hand off for, we have Love/Hate's Charlie Murphy...\nAmanda Byram set about ruffling a few feathers in Umit Kutluk...\nWhile, at the other end of the spectrum, we have Outlander's Catriona Balfe in a simple guna.\nOur favourite look of the night, however, was worn by Sarah Greene. She channeled Marion Cotillard in custom Helen Cody.\nGiven this TV equivalent is taking place in the depths of October, we're hoping the red carpet ensembles will include lots of shimmer and faux fur gillets. They'll catch their death other wise!\nThe IFTA Gala Television Awards ceremony will broadcast on TV3 on Friday 23rd at 9pm, and we'll have all the photos from the red carpet from early Friday morning.\nMORE: Pics: All the looks from last night's IFTA red carpet - Huberman, Greene, Cannon, Byram, Balfe\nREAD: Ghosthunter: On Icy Trails - Movie Review\nMORE: Watch: This promo for UFC 193 stars Ronda Rousey's little sister and is amazing", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T18:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:33:28.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
