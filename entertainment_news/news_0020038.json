When the final results were released the ANC had retained a comfortable majority of 62.15%, the DA continued its growth trend reaching 22.23% and the new kids on the block were recorded at 6.35%. The remaining 9.23% was shared among the 26 remaining parties on the national ballot.\nYet in only considering the votes cast one would be considering only half the picture. While 18 654 457 votes had been cast, a total of 25 381 293 South Africans had registered to vote, while the country has an eligible electorate of 33 million according to ISS data. This is to say that 14 354 543 South Africans representing 43.49% of the eligible electorate chose not to vote at all. Its interesting to note that this is 2 917 622 votes MORE than the African National Congress received.\nIf not the ANC, then who? One of the greatest failures of the South African opposition has been their inability to present the electorate with a viable alternative to the governing party. When looking at the DA, the party has a habit of focusing more on the ANC than on themselves, especially during election campaigns. If I could recall a single aspect of the DA's 2009 election campaign it would be the party's 'Stop Zuma' placards that they put up across the the country, while in 2014 we heard more about Nkandla than about the DA itself.\nThe pursuit of justice and accountability, particularly at the top levels of government, is of undeniable importance and in this regard the opposition has my support as they have support of the majority of South Africans as matter of principle, however, during an election campaign one might spend your time and resources convincing the electorate why they should vote for you rather than why they should not vote for another. The DA would be wise to remember that disillusionment with the ANC does not necessarily translate into support for their own party.\nWhen one turns to the EFF, reports from their members with regard to a lack of internal democracy is of extreme concern to any South African with an eye on opposition parties. The EFF advocates a Leninist style of state nationalism, not socialism, under which all resources and power would be vested in the hands of a small ruling class. If the EFF can not even manage a party that enjoys the support of less than one in ten South Africans and has barely been around for a year, then they can hardly be trusted with governing a country, particularly under their proposed model of governance. Further the EFF is yet to win a municipality where they would have the opportunity to implement their proposed policies, albeit to a limited degree.\nMillions of South Africans know that we will not be voting for the ANC in the 2016 local and provincial government elections and one does not have to dig very deep in order to find reasons in support of this position. While the ANC lead government blames our weak economy on the global economy and South Africa is expected to record a meagre 1.5% GDP growth in 2015, if we are able to avoid recession, Africa is growing at an average of 6% and is home to ten of the world's fastest growing economies.\nAt the same time political corruption and maladministration has reached pandemic levels with the National Treasury estimating that R30 billion is lost to corruption in the process of government procurement EACH YEAR. And one can hardly expect the situation to improve under the current administration when President Zuma routinely makes corruption and the looting of public funds a laughing matter, or when the first citizen of this country is willing to trample on the Constitution and abuse the executive and legislative arms of government while undermining the Office of the Public Protector in his desperate, but ultimately senseless, attempt to escape personal accountability.\nEqually one can not expect corruption to decline when the President in one sentence commits the ANC to eradicating corruption and in another tells us that if private sector companies does not donate to the ANC, they will be in trouble. So in effect he is saying - 'We are committed to eradicating corruption, however, if you are NOT corrupt, you will be punished.' While it may be normal for politicians to be stupid, it is highly insulting for them to assume that we are as well!\nConclusion\nThat then brings us back to the original question - if not the ANC then who do we support.?Unfortunately I cannot answer this question for the nearly one in two South Africans that chose not to vote on the 7th of May 2014 or the millions that may have voted for a specific party due the lack of viable opposition, however, I can answer it for myself.\nAs a citizen of this country I have a responsibility to vote and in doing so play my part in holding government to account. In 2014 my vote went to the UDM and in 2016 I will mark my X next to the column of the Workers and Socialist Party. Neither of these parties has a realistic chance of winning the elections, or even a municipality in terms of the latter. However in voting for them I would have fulfilled my responsibility as a citizen of this country, while also contributing to reducing the majority of the ANC.\nI would encourage my fellow South Africans to vote for South Africa - if you cannot bring yourself to vote for the DA or EFF, select any of the remaining 26 parties on the ballot. Any democracy where one party is ensured of electoral victory regardless of how they govern is bound to be dysfunctional to some degree. At present the ANC knows that they will win the upcoming elections with a comfortable majority, they could demolish the existing Nkandla compound and build a billion dollar compound in its place, the Marikana tragedy could be repeated, the amount lost to corruption each year can rise from R30 billion to R300 billion and still they would be elected. This places the average South African in a highly precarious position.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T16:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:11:14.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
