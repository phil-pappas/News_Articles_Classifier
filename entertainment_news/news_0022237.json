JAY JANNER / AMERICAN-STATESMAN \nScarface was a man of few words after accepting his \"I Am Hip Hop\" award, directing the attention away from himself and toward the many that have supported the veteran rapper. \nRapper Ludacris introduced Scarface, calling him one of \"hip-hop's best storytellers\" at the taped 10th annual BET Hip-Hop Awards on Friday night. The Houston-based Scarface said he learned from the best in rap and felt honored to receive the award before a packed audience at the Boisfeuillet Jones Atlanta Civic Center.

I've had the best teachers in the game.\" \nWith Ludacris standing behind him on stage, Scarface kept his speech brief: \"I'm not (expletive) without y'all,\" he said while raising the award in the air before walking off. He was given the award for his musical achievements. \nScarface initially gained fame in the late 1980s with the group Geto Boys through the song \"Mind Playing Tricks on Me.\" One of the few Houston acts to win acclaim outside Texas before 2000, he became a respected influencer in hip-hop with his gritty lyrics and street wisdom.

I learned a lot from him.\" \nWith 12 solo albums released, Scarface is known for songs such as \"Smile,\" ''My Block\" and \"I Seen a Man Die.\" He has collaborated with some of rap's greatest from 2 Pac to Jay Z. \n\"He's in my top five rappers of all time,\" veteran rapper E-40 said. \"He was one of the best. We go way back since 1992. He deserves it.
