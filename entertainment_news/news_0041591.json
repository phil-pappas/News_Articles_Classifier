According to The Smoking Gun , Andrews is seeking the damages from Marriott International and Michael David Barrett, the man who stalked her and ultimately released video footage showing the reporter naked in a hotel room. >> Read more trending stories In 2008, Barrett secretly videotaped Andrews through a peephole in a Tennessee hotel room where she was completely undressed. According to People , Barrett allegedly gouged out the peephole to Andrews’ room and recorded her on his cellphone. The next year, he posted multiple videos of the host in the nude online. The footage went viral. Andrews, 37, wants the hotel chain to pay up because she says its employees told Barrett she was staying at the hotel, provided him with her room number and even allowed him to book a room next to hers. Andrews accused the hotel chain and Barrett of negligence and invasion of privacy. In 2009, Barrett pleaded guilty to interstate stalking and was sentenced to 30 months in prison. Last month, defense lawyers sought a court order requesting Andrews specify the amount of damages the ordeal cost her, The Smoking Gun reports. They suggested her claims were “unreasonably vague and ambiguous.” \nThe trial is set for February.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T10:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:16:17.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
