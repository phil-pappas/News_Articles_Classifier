In Chinaâ€™s spot foreign exchange market, the yuan is allowed to rise or fall by two percent from the central parity rate each trading day, Xinhua reported. \nThe central parity rate of the yuan against the US dollar is based on a weighted average of prices offered by market makers before the opening of the interbank market each business day. But US dollar rises. \nThe US dollar increased against most major currencies as investors were digesting better-than-expected jobless data from the country as well as the outcome of just-ended European Central Bank (ECB) meeting. \nIn late New York trading on Thursday, the euro fell to $1.1112 from $1.1337 in the previous session, while the dollar bought 120.71 Japanese yen, higher than 119.95 yen of the previous session, Xinhua reported. \n  7:57 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T05:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:11:11.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
