(Photo: Detroit Free Press) Buy Photo 325 CONNECT 18 TWEET LINKEDIN 3 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nGRAND RAPIDS — For me, the most rewarding corner of the seventh edition of ArtPrize, the sprawling contemporary art competition that engulfs the city for three weeks and offers more than $500,000 in prize money, unfolds on the third floor of a downtown office building. The space at 250 Monroe St., which is being renovated, retains a bare-bones, loft-like quality ideal for showcasing new art, and the tightly focused exhibition, \"Processing Fiber,\" is terrific. Confusion leads to visitors dismantling ArtPrize entry \nOn view are 17 works, made from yarn, nylon, cotton, woven carpet, thread, felt and various mixed media, that run the gamut from traditional quilts and wall hangings to pieces that defy simple description. Among the best is \"My Puffy Shag Rug\" by Amy Masters, a humorous, garish installation that creeps across the floor of a small office like an interior-design nightmare from the 1970s. \nAnother strong entry is Faig Ahmed's elegantly provocative \"Embroidery Space\" in which the black threads of an intricate weaving leap aggressively off the wall to create a mesmerizing installation. 10 highlights from the 2014 ArtPrize competition in Grand Rapids \nThe curator responsible for \"Processing Fiber\" is Elizabeth Hertl, one of four young curatorial fellows each feted with a $10,000 grant from ArtPrize and paired with mentors in a new initiative for 2015. The consistent quality of \"Processing Fiber\" — about half the artists were recruited by Hertl and half were chosen by her from the thousands who applied on the open-call ArtPrize website — attests to the sharpness of her eye. The thoughtful juxtapositions underscore the diversity, imagination and expressiveness of contemporary fiber art. \nBut the success of \"Processing Fiber\" also speaks to a larger point about the growth of ArtPrize, which continues through Oct. 11. Since its founding, the competition has wrestled with the need to stay true to its populist roots while elevating the amount of good-quality art on display. Early on, the organization added jury awards to go along with the popular voting and more recently has balanced the prize money equally with $200,000 going to the winner of the public vote and $200,000 going to the experts' pick. Last year, the competition began awarding 25 $2,000 grants to artists to defray work and travel expenses, and this year inaugurated a $30,000 program to help venues organize exhibitions. Buy Photo \n\"Embroidery Space\" by Faig Ahmed displayed at 250 Monroe as part of the \"Processing Fiber\" exhibit during ArtPrize Seven in Grand Rapids on Monday, September 27, 2015. (Photo: Detroit Free Press) \nThe targeted investments, impressive lineup of jurors and new curatorial initiatives are attracting higher-level artists and creating more trenchant thematic exhibitions that exist like self-contained planets within the ArtPrize universe. Finding ways to nurture emerging curatorial voices like Hertl, a curatorial assistant at the homegrown Frederick Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park, is an especially welcome development, though I could also imagine a parallel program pitched at more experienced curators, too. ArtPrize jurors announce shortlists \nIn any case, the willingness of ArtPrize leaders to keep tweaking the original idea created by entrepreneur Rick DeVos has remained one of the keys to the upward trajectory of the competition, which attracted 440,000 visitors in 2014 and has become a signature cultural event not only for Grand Rapids but also the state — and will be expanding to include a franchise in Dallas, Texas, starting in April 2016. \nI spent a day and a half last week seeing as much of ArtPrize as I could, but it wasn't nearly enough time to see all 1,550 works in 162 venues. As usual, art is everywhere — museums, galleries, bars, bridges, civic spaces, street corners, hotels, the convention center, restaurants, churches, banks, stores, etc. The heart of ArtPrize remains the downtown city core, though the Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park on the outskirts of town and Site: Lab's Rumsey Street Project south of downtown, are must-see for visitors. \nAlso as usual, you'll see a lot of marginal work: amateur painting and sculpture, dorky installations, sophomoric conceptualism and tiresome message works in which political posturing trumps aesthetics. But the best works easily redeem the hunt, and the good news is that the amount of compelling stuff keeps expanding. \nArtPrize Highlights: \nBest Traditional Venues: The Grand Rapids Art Museum's well-edited exhibition \"Nature/Nurture,\" whose 15 works explore ideas surrounding inborn and environmental influences on identity and perception. The Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park, in partnership with the Shigaraki Ceramic Cultural Park in Japan, has mounted a sublime exhibition of contemporary Japanese ceramics that honor the past while pushing the genre forward.

(Photo: Detroit Free Press) \nAnd in addition to the aforementioned fiber show at 250 Monroe, don't miss the large installations on the second floor, both the result of the competition's open \"Pitch Night\" held in cities around the country, particularly Emily Kennerk's \"Whisper.\" The artist, a 2001 Cranbrook Academy of Art graduate now based near Indianapolis, has created an 80-foot dinner table electronically rigged so that when viewers whisper (not talk or shout) into a microphone, it causes an earthquake-like rumble and roar. Silverware, plates, glasses shake and fall, eventually crashing to the floor.The technology is secondary to the sensory delight and evocation of the power of the conspiratorial whisper — think Iago planting the seed of evil in Othello's ear. \nRelated: Metro Detroit artists take talent to ArtPrize Buy Photo \nThe \"Whisper\" installation by Emily Kennerk incorporates sound into its display at 250 Monroe during ArtPrize Seven in Grand Rapids on Monday, September 27, 2015. (Photo: Detroit Free Press) \nBest Nontraditional Venue: It's impossible for Detroiters to tour Site: Lab's Rumsey Street Project, an entire block of 10 abandoned structures (a church, homes, garages) given over to artists in a lower-income neighborhood, and not think of Tyree Guyton's Heidelberg Project. Still, the feeling of Rumsey Street, curated by Paul Amenta, is less urgent, less whimsical and more cerebral, and the fundamental decay not nearly as horrifying. My favorite works are by two New Yorkers: Diana Shpungin's \"Drawing of a House (Triptych)\" and Kate Gilmore's \"Higher Ground.\" Buy Photo \n\"Higher Ground\" by Kate Gilmore at the Site: Lab Rumsey Street Project during ArtPrize Seven in Grand Rapids on Monday, September 27, 2015. (Photo: Detroit Free Press) \nShpungin and a team have covered a house entirely in graphite, an obsessive achievement yielding a black, portentous structure, a metaphor perhaps for the death of a neighborhood. (There are also enigmatic videos in the windows on three sides of the house.) Gilmore's piece offers more smiles. The house is painted pink, with child swings mounted inside that allow a gaggle of women to simultaneously sway in and out of the windows in a choreographed commentary on gender roles and domesticity. (Scheduling prevented me from seeing the dance performances included in the Rumsey Street Project selected by Amy Wilson, another 2015 curatorial fellow and herself a dancer-choreographer who won the Time-based Jury Award at the 2014 ArtPrize.) \nBest Painting: Seattle-based Krista Schoening's \"Karma Dahlia II,\" a drop-dead gorgeous large-scale representational oil painting on a round canvas of a flower in bloom. The painterly strokes of reds, maroons and purples, the nuanced light and the view from above as if looking into the center of the earth keep your gaze locked on the picture. (Grand Rapids Art Museum) Buy Photo \n\"Karma Dahlia II\" by Krista Schoening at the Grand Rapids Art Museum during ArtPrize Seven in Grand Rapids on Monday, September 27, 2015. (Photo: Detroit Free Press) \nBest Videos: New Yorker Shannon Plumb's hilarious \"Rattles and Cherries\" finds the artist vamping it up in a faux silent movie wearing a nightie and employing a banana and a fainting couch — while a baby cries off-screen (and later appears in a breastfeeding scene). Plum is asking whether she can simultaneously be an artist, a mother and a sexy woman. Of course she can. (Grand Rapids Art Museum) \n\"That Was Then\" by Prince Thomas of Houston meticulously syncs audio of CNN war correspondents' live on-the-ground coverage of the opening hours of the Gulf War in Baghdad in 1991 with video of a spectacular American fireworks display. Comparing contemporary war to video game imagery has become a trope, but Thomas, an Indian artist born in Kuwait and raised in America and India, has found a fresh way to explore the surreal quality of modern warfare and real-time media coverage. (Kendall College of Art and Design at the Federal Building) \nHit and Miss: At both the Kendall exhibition and the Urban Institute of Contemporary Art, I found the exhibition themes and art muddled and uneven, but there are still some strong entries. Thomas' video is at Kendall, and my fave at UICA was a sweeping, multipart installation by Charles Jevremovic of South Bend, Ind. He has stuffed an entire gallery with creaky, mid-20th-Century vintage rocket scene detritus: mainframes, glowing screens, gauges, knobs, buttons. It's like a 1950s version of the future. Even better is the artist's huge wall sculpture nearby seemingly made of deconstructed computer innards cast in greens, blacks and mustards. It reads like a modular abstract painting from the same era. \nBest Ceramics: All but a few of the 25 works at Meijer Gardens hit the bull's-eye, but I was particularly taken with three: Hiroshi Taruta's delicate, luminescent porcelain vase in shades of jade with pinkish stripes; Masami Hosokawa's large corpulent stoneware form whose gently sloping wings suggest a striking lightness of being; and Kunihiro Akinaga's black stoneware skeleton of an animal, which suggests an artist mediating on life and death.
