The new clip, via E! News , shows the not-dead Alison DiLaurentis standing with the rest of the Liars in front of a coffin — a change that really could have happened a while ago since she's been known to be alive since the end of season four, but maybe they were just letting people get caught up on the action. This opening also gives the all-important \"shhh\" duty, previously handled by Aria (Lucy Hale), to a new Liar: Emily (Shay Mitchell). How will she handle this intense responsibility?\n A premiere date for the second half of season six hasn't been set yet, but a flash-forward during the summer finale showed that things will be quite different for the Liars when ​PLL ​picks up again . ​\"They're still friends, but like what happens after you get out of college, you don't get to see your friends all the time,\" I. Marlene King told E! News . \"So there's a reason they have to come back to town and they're bringing some secrets back with them, too.\" ​ Well of course. You're not allowed to cross the Rosewood town line if you're not hiding at least three dangerous and/or illegal things about yourself from your family and friends.\n​Follow Eliza on Twitter .", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/thompsonplaid", "http://www.eonline.com/videos/embed/241401", "http://www.eonline.com/news/704345/behold-the-epic-new-pretty-little-liars-opening-title-sequence-plus-see-all-the-girls-shh"], "published": "2015-10-09T01:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:24:58.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
