With Gulzar saab's work at the pen joining Vishal's formidable sense of melody, Talvar's album a heady quality. The album opens with the haunting Insaaf sung by US-based Pakistani vocalist Arooj Aftab, whose resounding crooning syncs well with the composer's minimalistic approach. There is a restless energy and unmissable grief in Aftab's voice, which will well-up listeners. Repeating his favourite Sukhwinder Singh in Patli Gali after the iconoclastic Bismil in Haider was a good move. Singh's infallible energy rubs off on the song, which has a hint of Gulzar-Bhardwaj's early associations in Maachis. With classical arrangements to its aid, the song's strong lyrics are its high point. Rekha Bhardwaj's heaving voice is used to a hypnotic effect in Zinda, which benefits from its guitar-accordion ambience. It climaxes in an uplifting crescendo. Bhardwaj ends the album with the lofty Shaam Ke Saaye which Arijit Singh enlivens with his spirited soulful singing. The guitar arrangement in the background mixes with the singer's breathy voice to weave out sheer magic. Subtlety is a key trait in this album. Talvar's music is grim, filled with pathos and pays a perfect homage to its theme.\nLISTEN: Songs of Talvar on Gaana.com\nWATCH: 'Talvar' Official Trailer | Irrfan Khan, Konkona Sen Sharma, Neeraj Kabi, Sohum Shah, Atul Kumar", "external_links": ["http://gaana.com/album/talvar", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/aQNMsw8Ljjc"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T11:10:44.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
