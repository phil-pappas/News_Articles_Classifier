I started with Beatles and British Invasion, moved on to psychedelic and garage rock, then advanced to progressive rock with Yes, Jethro Tull and Emerson, Lake & Palmer New Wave, punk, alternative and grunge followed, so you don't need a metal detector to see what I missed. While friends headbanged to Iron Maiden and Black Sabbath, I was the outcast in the corner listening to Roxy Music, David Bowie and the Talking Heads. Though I'm no metalhead, I do like the self-titled CD by Sarsen, the Erie metal band that plays a CD release show tonight at Bobby's Place with the Bong Mongrels and Brotherhood of the Jam. Sarsen blends progressive and hard-rock approaches on heavy, churning-rhythm material with time-signature shifts, harmony flourishes and dramatic heft. Influences abound -- Rush, Sabbath, Metallica -- but they add up to something fresh, invigorating and accessible on \"Sarsen.\" \"We seem to have this middle ground of appeal where we've got some heaviness and some unique songwriting. The feedback is overwhelmingly positive since we released this album,\" said Sarsen bassist Andrew Vicary. \"Folks who aren't normally necessarily into this kind of music seem to be responding.\" Sarsen also includes talented guitarist Lucien Gaydos, who's allowed to solo, drummer Cody Hoepl and expressive, versatile vocalist Mike Edgerly. \"All four of us have really distinct influences,\" Vicary said. \"Luc and I are pretty big Rush fans. Cody, our drummer, is really into grunge and stoner metal. \"So, having the heavier drums behind the more, I guess, instrumental kind of musicianship with the way Luc and I write is different than a lot of other metal guys. \"And Mike, our singer, goes all over the place. He's done blues and alternative rock and all kind of things, so having a versatile vocalist over that is real benefit.\" Sarsen's songs are dark but not death-metal, oath-to-Satan, kill-everyone dark. Heck, Vicary is a father of three who can't wait for \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\" \"We're not particularly angry guys,\" he said. \"But having this sort of darker music gives us the opportunity to talk about and approach those themes and tell a darker, scary story along with our music.\" The CD features a new recording of \"The Dying of Katherine Montaine,\" a bluesy, Southern-metal track from the band's first EP. It follows \"Curse of Man,\" an epic that signals where they're headed. \"I'm not going to call it our '2112' on this album, but it's got that feel where it's very progressive, lots of tempo changes. Going forward it's a great representation of what we can do.\" DAVE RICHARDS can be reached at 870-1703 or by e-mail at dave.richards@timesnews.com . Follow him on twitter at Twitter.com/ETNrichards.
