Self-published by Dodreams, the gladiatorial arena racing game has 4.5 million downloads on iOS since mid-May. Now it's also available on the Android devices.\n'Drive Ahead!' is a true social experience. In addition to single-player missions, you play against friends on one device. Parents don't like when their children fight over turns to play. Also, there aren't many games to play when spending time with friends. The local multiplayer solves the problem by bringing family and friends to play on the same device.\nThis concept hits the spot. Four months after installation, 15% of players still return weekly. Top markets for the game are USA , Australia , China , Russia and Brazil .\nDodreams soft launched 'Drive Ahead!' on Google Play in Australia , Denmark and Finland on September 10 . It firmly holds the first spot on Denmark's racing download list. It's ranked #3 in Finland and #7 in Australia on the same list.\nThe goal of the company has been to create a fair free-to-play game: You can play 'Drive Ahead!' as much as you like without pay walls or limiting game sessions. You can even play offline, which is not guaranteed for mobile games nowadays.\nThough 'Drive Ahead!' is a skill game you can play without money, many watch ads or make in-app purchases to unlock new cars and tracks quicker. The game's 500,000 daily active users watch in total over 2,500 hours of video ads each day.\nThe game is a viral phenomenon with 200,000 fans sharing nearly 800,000 gameplay clips online. In two months, the game's fan base grew 10 fold to 60,000 likes on Facebook. This growth took Dodreams to #1 position on the list for hottest trending startups in Finland , according to Startup 100.\nNext, the game will be available globally on Google Play on October 8, 2015 .\nPromo art: http://bit.ly/DAPromoArt\nYouTube trailer: http://bit.ly/DAandroidTrailer\nDrive Ahead! on the Everyplay video community: http://bit.ly/DriveAheadEveryplay\nList of hottest trending startups in Finland (October): http://startup100.net/\nDownload Drive Ahead! on iOS: http://bit.ly/DriveAheadAndroid\nDownload DriveAhead! on Google Play: http://bit.ly/DriveAheadAndroid\nVideo - https://youtu.be/qTfCW4PmGJU\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151008/275508\n releases/finlands-hottest-startup-bring-ipad-racing-hit-to-google-play-300157187.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=LN24291&Transmission_Id=201510090800PR_NEWS_USPR_____LN24291&DateId=20151009", "http://bit.ly/DAandroidTrailer", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTfCW4PmGJU?version=3", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151008/275508", "http://startup100.net/", "http://bit.ly/DAPromoArt", "https://youtu.be/qTfCW4PmGJU", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151008/275508", "http://bit.ly/DriveAheadEveryplay", "http://bit.ly/DriveAheadAndroid", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/finlands-hottest-startup-bring-ipad-racing-hit-to-google-play-300157187.html"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:24:51.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
