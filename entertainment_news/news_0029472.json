We're not saying people are lying in court, or that An Post aren't doing their job, but something's up here.\nThe Gardai have claimed that serving summonses correctly is being made harder because of inaccurate address data. Whether it's people not notifying them of a change in address, or simply living in an apartment block, which as we all know makes getting post an absolute pain. Unless, you know, if you just write your apartment number on the address. I know, rocket-science stuff.\nThe average number of drivers escaping without conviction is 77%, with Co. Kerry holding the highest number, 89%, and Co. Wexford being the lowest on 67%.\nVia Irish Times\nMORE: Here's where Ireland ranks in the list of Europe's most expensive countries\nMORE: Watch: John Oliver tore through that Facebook privacy hoax\nMORE: 91% of Irish people would have potatoes in their death row meal", "external_links": ["http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/four-out-of-five-drivers-escape-conviction-over-penalty-points-1.2373593"], "published": "2015-10-01T21:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:34:50.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
