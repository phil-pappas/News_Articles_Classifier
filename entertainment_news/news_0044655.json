Now that they are 40-something and 30-something, respectively, they are each trying to figure out exactly what they want out of life, while their families are fighting over a postage-stamp-size piece of land.\nAlso in the play are Utah-based actor Max Robinson, who plays Anthony's father, Tony, and Sybil Lines, who plays Rosemary's aged mother, Aoife (A-fee).\n \"People don't appeal to me that much,\" Anthony remarks, and Rosemary quickly responds: \"That's normal. Who likes people? Nobody.\"\n\"Outside Mullingar,\" Shanley's contemporary play with a vintage feel, opens at Pioneer Theatre Company on Friday and runs through Nov. 14. The play debuted on Broadway last year with noted stage actor Brian F. O'Byrne and Debra Messing (in her Broadway debut) in the central roles, and was reviewed in The New York Times under this headline: \"Weary, brooding and made for each other.\"\nShanley is renown for his 2005 Pulitzer and Tony Award-winning play, \"Doubt,\" as well as the Oscar he earned for his script for 2007's \"Moonstruck,\" which notably paired Nicolas Cage and Cher as star-crossed lovers.\nTheatergoers across the country will visit the midlands of Ireland with Shanley's characters in \"Outside Mullingar,\" which will receive 11 regional productions this season, earning the third spot on the Top 10 plays list compiled annually by the Theatre Communications Group.\nProgramming the quiet family \"Outside Mullingar\" back-to-back with the season-opener, the big blockbuster musical \"Fiddler on the Roof,\" says something interesting about Pioneer's eclectic season, says Bodnar, who was last seen as Gwendolyn Pigeon in PTC's 2013 \"The Odd Couple.\" She thinks the Irish play continues some of the thematic notes about family and place sounded in \"Fiddler.\"\nMention the magical realism of Shanley's \"Moonstruck,\" and Bodnar laughs. \"I've always wanted to be Cher,\" says the former ballet dancer, \"and this is as close as I'm going to get.\"\nBodnar describes her character as strong and confident. Perhaps it's the point of the play that none of the characters have an urban edge. These aren't people who are likely to carry a smartphone or swipe around on Tinder or other Internet dating sites. \"It's a story between two people who have lived life,\" she says.\nO'Keefe calls his character a little thick, and yet extraordinarily sensitive. \"Anthony overthinks things, and so do I,\" says O'Keefe, who admits he's newly attuned to love stories after proposing to his longtime girlfriend just two months ago. \"He's struggling with these massive, massive questions, and he misses what's going on around him.\"\nThe play is basically about \"these two people stripping down all the stuff between them to finally get to what they want,\" he says. \"It's kind of an old-fashioned modern story, about love and land and family. It's very relatable, about the very simple things we all deal with: 'Am I crazy? Do I deserve to be in love?' \"\nPioneer guest director Julie Kramer appreciates the play's mystical element and how it uses comedy to reveal emotional truths. \"And the language is really beautiful,\" she says. \"What's interesting, when you get into rehearsal, is that just making a cup of tea becomes sort of a declaration of battle.\"\nShe says she worked with guest set designer Daniel Meeker (his most recent PTC design was for 2014's \"The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee\") to explore the tension between the enclosed spaces inside the two families' homes and the expansiveness of their farms.\n\"It's a play about these people who live in small town and small houses, but they have big ideas and big loves,\" she says. \"I think it is good to be able to have the space to fill that with in this play. Fill it with their desires, fulfilled and unfulfilled.\"\nellenf@sltrib.com\nfacebook.com/ellen.weist", "external_links": ["http://facebook.com/ellen.weist"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:39:24.415+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
