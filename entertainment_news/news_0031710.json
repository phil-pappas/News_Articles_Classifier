At 51, Bellucci has succeeded Blackman as the oldest Bond girl.\nBlackman found international stardom as Bond Girl Pussy Galore at 38, alongside Sean Connery, in 1964's Goldfinger.\nWriting in the Daily Mirror, she said commentators did \"bang on\" about her age at the time.\nShe added: \"It's wonderful that one of the leading ladies in the new 007 outing, Spectre, is taking the title from me, even if it did take more than half a century. But I also think it's crazy that 51-year-old Monica Bellucci's age is still causing a similar stir.\n\"I just don't understand why we are still obsessed with age. Or rather, I don't understand why men are still so obsessed with the age of women. Because that's what we are really talking about. Instead of the ridiculous obsession with age, the only thing to ask is does she fit the bill?\"\nShare article Suggesting men's looks were not viewed as important as women's in the film industry, Blackman said Daniel Craig, reprising his role as the MI6 spy for the fourth time, was \"not the most handsome Bond\" but was a \"great actor\".\nShe also ruled out a future female Bond, saying: \"Having an older Bond girl is a sign of progress too. Though I don't think you could ever have a female 007. That wasn't what Fleming wrote.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-22T15:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T11:22:19.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
