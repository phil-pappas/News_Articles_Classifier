Or so they think.\nBecky E. Adamietz, the museum’s director of public affairs, said on Thursday that since the photo was first published on Reddit two years ago, no other visitor has claimed they have seen a ghost-like creature lurking around the museum.\nRELATED: Photo of ghostlike figure at El Paso High School goes viral\nThe creepy image, originally published by KRAMERisCRUNK on Reddit , shows a dark silhouette in the corner of a children’s exhibit. The figure seems to be hooded, but its hands and face are distorted.\nAt least two publications have reported on the photo leading up to Halloween 2015, including the Dallas Observer .\n“I guess if you have an active imagination, you could see whatever you want,” Adamietz said. “It’s more of a curiosity than anything else, I guess.”\nStill, employees at the museum have had “discussions” about what the figure could be, she said.\nMuseum staff believe the shadow is a distorted parent or child cleaning up, she said, adding the lens was simply “out of focus” because the figure was standing in a dark corner.\nAdamietz said the photo has made its rounds every Halloween, and “maybe every Halloween, it’s going to pop up again.”\nClick through the slideshow to view various versions of the
