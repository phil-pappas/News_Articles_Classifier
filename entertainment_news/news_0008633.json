The son of filmmaker Ashok Pandit, he was a child prodigy, starting music early at three years of age.\nREAD: Raj Pandit: It's an experience I feel lucky to be getting at this stage and this age in my life\nListen to songs of Bang Bang on Gaana.com\nHe prefers being known for his work and skills rather than his filmi background. \" I am happy my parents never pushed me into doing reality shows ,\" he says in an interview. Excerpts.\nHow did the songs of Wedding Pullav happen?\nI have sung two songs in Wedding Pullav . One is called ' O Jaaniya' featuring me alongside Salim Merchant and Shreya Ghoshal, and the other is my solo ' Lagan lagi '. Before this, I'd done the title song of the film ' Rabba main kya karoon .' It was a duet composed by Salim-Sulaiman. It so happened that I sang a part in ' O Jaaniya' as a cue vocal. They liked it so much that they decided to keep my voice for both songs. ' Lagan lagi' is a traditional Sufi kalam by Bulleh Shah. When we come to talk about Sufiana music, it has been a very big part of my learning and growing up days.\nYou have a long association with Salim-Sulaiman.\nIt's like a family. I've been part of the Salim-Sulaiman team for the past four years. I've been working with them as an assistant and as a music producer at their studio. Apart from the songs and advertising work they do, I've also been a part of the background scores of Krrish 3, Race 2, Bang Bang and upcoming film Jai Gangaajal . For the last two years, I have also been singing with Salim-Sulaiman Live. In fact, I'm just back from a North America tour we did in September where we covered eight or nine cities. It's incredible to have people like them to mentor you. They never make you feel like you are working for them, it's always about working with them. The fact that my first film's songs are composed by them is something I've always wanted. It's an experience I feel lucky to be getting at this stage and this age in my life. It's incredible to be working and being on the other (technical) side of things, as well as recording and working with iconic singers like Sonu Nigam, Shreya Ghoshal, Sunidhi Chauhan and Arijit Singh.\nWhat was the journey into singing like?\nI'm originally a Kashmiri Pandit but I'm born and brought up in Mumbai. My mother Neerja Pandit is a trained classical and folk singer from Kashmir. When kids my age were playing with gaming consoles, I had musical instruments to play with. The tabla was something I picked up on my own as a child. I started learning the tabla when I turned four, first from percussionist Shadab Bhartiya, and then at Ustad Allah Rakha Khan's Institute of Music. I got guidance from Ustad Zakir Hussain and Taufiq Qureshi. It's incredible when such amazing artistes teach you. It was such a homely environment at that institute. It laid a strong Indian classical foundation for me as a musician and singer. When I was eight, I also started learning the piano and western classical music. The melodic side of things opened up while learning the piano. I started tinkering with programming software and when I was 12, I made a Kashmiri folk remix music album of songs my mother had sung. Doing correspondence exams from London College of Music and Trinity College London opened up another world for me. Before working with Salim-Sulaiman, I also worked with Raju Singh on the background scores of television serials and films. I am still learning music since playing is something I never want to lose out on.\nTell us about ' Peer manaawan challiyaan .'\nThe song released on August 15. It was for an Independence Day special that Salim Sulaiman were doing for Coke Studio @ MTV Season 4. We just had two-three days to finish the song. Sukhwinder Singh wrote it and sang it with Salim and me. 'Peer manaawan challiyaan ' was a step forward. Two years ago, I had done backing vocals and was part of the song ' Bismillah' on the same show.\nWhat kind of music do you listen to?\nI listen to everything I can. Listening is the most important form of learning. That is something I have been taught, to be able to open your eyes to all kinds of genres.\nWhat next?\nThe independent single Kashmir with my mother, composed by Bhajan Sopori, a leading composer of the community. Anupam Kher has lent his voice for a couplet in Hindustani, so the non-Kashmiri gets to know what we are talking about. It's a traditional folk composition but we have produced it in a contemporary way, so that connoisseurs of world music can relate to it. It talks about how we hope that peace returns to the Valley. There has been so much unrest for the past 25 years. As musicians, this is something we can do from our end.\nFor latest Bollywood updates follow us on Twitter >>> @TOIEntertain\nFor the latest in Bollywood news, like us on Facebook >>> TOIEntertain\nFor more interesting Bollywood news and pictures follow us on Pinterest>>> timesofindia\nFor latest Bollywood updates follow us on G+ >>> The Times of India Entertainment\nWATCH: Wedding Pullav | Official Trailer | Introducing Anushka, Diganth, Karan V Grover, Sonali Sehgal", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain", "https://www.pinterest.com/timesofindia/", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107628521107103264647/+TOIEntertainment/posts", "https://twitter.com/TOIEntertain", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/mqhcr4QZE6s", "http://gaana.com/album/meherbaan-from-bang-bang"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T15:38:20.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
