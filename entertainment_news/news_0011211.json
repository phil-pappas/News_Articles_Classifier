(Originally published by the Daily News on October 15, 1990. This story was written by Ingrid Devita, Bill Bell and Ruth Landa.)\nLeonard Bernstein, 72, the towering genius who gave the world the music of “West Side Story” and “On the Town” and was America’s most celebrated classical conductor for more than 40 years, died last night at his home in Manhattan.\nHis doctor, Kevin Cahill, said Bernstein died at 6:15 p.m. of cardiac arrest caused by progressive lung failure.\nBernstein was a heavy smoker with a history of breathing difficulties, which Cahill linked to progressive emphysema.\nImmediately after the announcement of Bernstein’s death, classical music stations in the city began broadcasting music that he conducted or composed.\nDeath came only four days after Bernstein announced he was putting down his baton on orders of his doctor.\n“I feel the same as the rest of the world’s going to feel, a sense of incredible loss,” said Adolph Green, who with Betty Comden wrote the lyrics for the Broadway hits “On the Town” and the Tony-winning “Wonderful Town.”\nPlanned one more\nAt the time of his death, Bernstein was planning one last engagement - an Oct. 28 AIDS benefit concert at Carnegie Hall.\nHe won Grammys, Emmys and Tonys. He recorded more than 100 albums and was once a TV celebrity whose “Young People’s Concerts” introduced baby boomers to the classics and won him no fewer than 11 Emmy awards.\nNew York Daily News NYDN Bernstein dead at 72 New York Daily News NYDN Bernstein dead at 72 New York Daily News NYDN Bernstein dead at 72 New York Daily News NYDN Bernstein dead at 72 Previous Next Enlarge His works ranged from the Oscar-nominated soundtrack score for the Marlon Brando film “ On the Waterfront ” to “Kaddish (Symphony No. 3),” which won a Grammy.\nHe composed a Mass, a 100th-birthday salute to his fellow composer Irving Berlin, the ballet “Fancy Free” and a suite celebrating the 50th anniversary of the founding of Israel. He even wrote a song cycle inspired by a cookbook, and a short opera, “Trouble in Tahiti.”\nHis last composition, the song cycle “Airs and Barcarolles,” was introduced in both piano and orchestra versions last year. Before his abrupt retirement, he planned to conduct the work with the New York Philharmonic on Dec. 6, which would have been his 1,245th appearance on its podium.\nHe was the first native-born conductor of a major American orchestra and the first American to conduct at the famed La Scala opera in Milan. He was casual enough about his fame to write a song cycle called “I Hate Music.”\nIt was his 11 years as director of the New York Philharmonic, starting in 1957, the year he completed “West Side Story,” that made him America’s most celebrated conductor. He led the orchestra on tours around the world and made it an international name.\nHe made headlines not only with his flamboyant style - conducting without baton, leaping and turning, tossing his full head of white hair - but also with his off-the-podium activities.\nOn his last visit to the White House, he managed to sneak 21 friends and family members into the Lincoln bedroom for a session of Jewish prayers.\nAnd out of pride in his Jewishness, he insisted that his name be pronounced “Bernstine,” not “Bern-steen.”\nHe recently rejected a National Medal of Arts to protest the cancellation of $10,000 National Endowment for the Arts grant for a New York art exhibit about AIDS. He once raised money for Black Panthers and was chided for his “radical chic” by Tom Wolfe.\nAP Leonard Bernstein conducts the New York Philharmonic Orchestra in New York in this July 9, 1959 photo. CHICK HARRITY/AP With his ever-present cigarette in hand, Leonard Bernstein pauses during a news conference in Washington on July 26, 1971. Previous Next Enlarge Some of his performances were profoundly symbolic. Last Christmas, at the Berlin Wall, he conducted Beethoven’s Ninth Sympthony, substituting the word “freedom” for “joy” in its last movement, “Ode to Joy.” He also led a performance at a liberated Nazi death camp.\nFor most Americans, Bernstein’s most notable music involved the songs from “West Side Story,” which included “Tonight,” “Maria,” “Something’s Coming” and “I Feel Pretty.”\nHis last appearance as a conductor was Aug. 19, at the Tanglewood Festival in Lenox, Mass., where he led the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He was a member of the faculty there for 45 years.\nHe was born Aug. 25, 1918, in Lawrence, Mass., the son of the owner of a beauty supply business. He was 10 before an aunt gave the family an upright piano and changed young Lenny’s life forever.\nHe went on to study under Walter Piston at Harvard, Fritz Reiner at Curtis Institute and Serge Koussevitzky at Tanglewood. But it wasn’t until November 1943, when he was 25, that Bernstein got his first big break.\nHe was asked at the last minute to substitute for an ailing Bruno Walter, the conductor of the New York Philharmonic, in a concert broadcast by national radio. Bernstein did - and awoke the next morning a celebrity.\nAs a conductor, Lenny, as friends called him, rarely used a baton. He used his entire body, singing the score throughout the composition. “He shagged, he shimmied and, believe it or not, he bumped,” said composer Virgil Thomson.\nWherever he went, Bernstein was lionized - Soviet fans waited in the rain for hours to touch his coat. Scalpers sold tickets to his appearances. His 1,000th appearance with the New York Philharmonic, in 1971, was one of the big artistic events of the year.\nHe arranged the music for the funeral in St. Patrick’s Cathedral of the assassinated Robert F. Kennedy in 1968, and conducted the Philharmonic there in Mahler’s Fifth Symphony.\nThe Kennedy family commissioned him to compose a Mass for the opening of the John F. Kennedy Center for Performing Arts in Washington.\nTags: archives", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:06:09.738+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
