In a speech that touched on his childhood in one of Rochester's poorest sections and summarized the much-anticipated first report of the poverty initiative, Brock was most animated and adamant when rolling out a multipoint plan for community involvement: \"Everyone give, even if it's a dollar to give, and give monthly,\" he said. Recruit 25 people to do the same to support a community-owned and operated initiative, business or charity.\n\"Make a commitment to build a relationship with one person that's not part of your natural network,\" he admonished about 400 people who likely all knew or knew of each other before they sat down at their tables of 10. \"Diversify your networks. Your network is your net worth. Make it a priority to spend time with people of different backgrounds, experiences and ideologies.\"\nBut as he said, the reports and data created from decades of meetings held to find solutions haven't done much other than reconfirm Rochester's poverty problem.\n\"We have to challenge the status quo,\" he said.\nFrom what I see on many sidewalks I travel, the first step is nodding to the person going the other way.\nPatti Singer is the Clean Living reporter for the Democrat and Chronicle .
