Online stating that the former two-time NBA champion and Sixth man of the Year was now being transported to Los Angeles after being admitted at the Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas about a week ago. He had to be rushed to the medical facility after he was found all but lifeless in the Nevada brothel called Love Ranch. Like Us on Facebook \nOdom would be airlifted via a helicopter and he would be accompanied by his estranged wife Khloe Kardashian who has reportedly never left his side throughout and from day one. The two has filed for divorce after four years together. \nAccording to his basketball college coach Jim Harrick, through CNN's New Day on Monday, Odom was able to muster and tell Khloe \"I love you.\" Harrick got the chance to know the reality TV star because of Odom, and even attended the ceremony where the couple exchanged vows back in 2009, notes CNN . \n\"I just come to fall in love with her,\" he said. \"She's a sweet, loving, lovely young girl. I think she's a rock. She's the best thing that ever happened (to him).\" Harrick also has some nice words to say about his former player. He believes that Odom might be one of the most popular guys who ever played in the NBA. \nMeanwhile, things are looking up for the ex-Los Angeles Lakers star. His condition is getting better by the day, and he can now breathe on his own, without the help of an oxygen mask. What's even better is the fact that he can move his limbs, already considering that he has just been through a medical-induced coma a few days ago. \nHe defied the odds and has since showed steady progress that includes going through a successful swallowing exam (a test of neurological function), and showing response through the use of hand signals. \nThe patient is not quite out of the woods just yet. Odom still has a long way to go and he would be needing a lot of rehab when things get a bit better. He still undergoes kidney dialysis and, although, his CT scan results were encouraging, he still struggles to stand up even with help from others. \nAccording to an earlier E! article , his hospital transfer was initially given a pending status until such time that Odom's condition gets more stable. His medical staff has, from then on, tried to iron things out in terms of the logistics of his transfer to a southern California hospital.
