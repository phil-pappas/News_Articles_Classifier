Sheriff's Office Nine-week-old Florida baby Chance Walsh is missing from his home in Sarasota County, police said. Relatives haven't seen him for up to a month, according to reports. A 9-week-old Florida baby is missing as his drug user parents keep changing their story about what happened to him, police said Wednesday.\nThe grandmother of Chance Walsh alerted the Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office on Sunday that family hadn’t seen the infant for nearly a month, according to the sheriff’s office .\nLongtime druggies Kristen Bury and Joseph Walsh told relatives they gave their baby away at a Georgia hotel, claimed he died in a car crash in South Carolina and then said Chance was fine after the Friday crash, officials in the sheriff’s office said. The couple are now behind bars on child neglect charges.\nPolice in both other states confirmed the baby wasn’t with the couple in Georgia or South Carolina. Investigators who searched the family’s apartment Monday in North Port, around 85 miles south of Tampa, found blood on a bed and in a bathroom at the home, according to arrest affidavits posted by WTSP-TV .\nSarasota Co. Sheriff's Office Kristen Bury and Joseph Walsh have been arrested and charged with neglect after their nine-week-old went missing. Bury tried to sell baby clothes and said her baby had died three weeks ago, a woman who also stayed at a Red Carpet Inn in Augusta, Ga., told police. It wasn’t clear why the family had traveled to stay at the hotel on Sept. 28 and Sept. 30.\nAnother infant born to the mother died in the past, and this made Bury “despise” Chance, she told her stepmother in a conversation mentioned in her affidavit. Bury said it was better that Chance wasn’t around because she was liable to hurt him.\n“I loved that baby. I can’t take care of him,” Bury told her stepmother.\nOn Saturday, though, she called her father from Hardeeville, S.C., to ask him for money after the crash. She told him the parents slept in nearby woods with the baby after the crash and that Chance was fine. Yet Walsh said the baby boy had died in the collision the very next day, according to the affidavit.\nThat’s when the relatives reported the missing baby. The parents, who have drugs, burglary and theft on their criminal records, are being held on a $150,000 bond in South Carolina, according to the sheriff’s office. Officials in the sheriff’s office plan to extradite the pair to Sarasota County jail.\n\"I get nauseous over these kinds of cases,\" Sarasota Sheriff’s Capt. Charlie Thorpe said at a news conference.\n10 News Investigators found blood on a bed and in a bathroom of the couple's North Port home, WTSP-TV reported. He added, “It's beyond frustrating, because someone knows what happened. Just tell us what happened. We're talking about a child here.”\nFollow on Twitter @tobysalkc\nON A MOBILE DEVICE?
