It's a film that introduces us to two men in North Carolina who are in a legal battle over an amputated and mummified leg. One of them men found it in a grill that he bought at auction and refuses to give it back. It's the kind of truly bizarre and unbelievable story that the phrase \"you have to see it to believe it\" was made for. (Cable & digital VOD)\n\"The Mend\": Writer/director John Magary makes his feature debut with this dark comedy. Josh Lucas (\"Sweet Home Alabama\") stars in a story about two estranged brothers in New York City who end up reconnecting and attempt to put their relationship back together. The publicity materials call it a film \"for anyone who's ever loathed and loved a sibling in equal measure.\" (Digital VOD)\nAVAILABLE ON STREAMING SERVICES\n\"The Duke Of Burgundy\": In his follow-up to \"Berberian Sound Studio,\" Peter Strickland's third feature film plays out as an art house counterpoint to \"Fifty Shades Of Grey.\" Exploring a dominant-submissive relationship between two women, the film manages to be intensely erotic without any on-screen nudity. Lavishly shot despite a small budget, the overall style benefits greatly from clothing designed by frequent Peter Greenaway collaborator Andrea Flesch. (Netflix)\n\"Ned Rifle\": Indie auteur Hal Hartley returns with the final, and best, film in his trilogy that also includes \"Henry Fool\" and \"Fay Grim.\" Parkey Posey, James Urbaniak, Liam Aiken and Martin Donovan reprise their roles from the previous films and are joined by Aubrey Plaza, who perfectly delivers Hartley's signature dry and carefully constructed dialogue. It's not vital that you have seen the earlier parts of the story to enjoy \"Ned Rifle,\" but it will help you to flesh out all of the connections because the film doesn't dwell much on the backstory. Hartley once again wrote, directed, produced and performed the score here, turning to Kickstarter to fund the project. (Netflix)\n\"Soul Boys of the Western World\": Best known for their 1983 hit \"True\" (which went to No. 1 in the U.K. and peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard charts in the U.S.), British brothers Gary and Martin Kemp led the pop group known as Spandau Ballet throughout the 1980s. Director George Hencken's documentary about their history is loaded with archival news footage and interviews from all five band members. The film culminates with footage from a reunion tour in 2010.
