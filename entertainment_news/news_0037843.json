(Nasdaq: SBGI) (\"Sinclair\") and American Red Cross today announce their collaboration to promote the American Red Cross Home Fire Campaign as part of Fire Prevention Week, October 5 â€“ 9, 2015.\n\"It is important to showcase the Home Fire Campaign to our communities across the country,\" said Steven Pruett , Co-COO of Sinclair Television Group. \"For many years our stations have worked with the Red Cross on a variety of campaigns, so we are very excited about coordinating all of our stations' efforts to get behind this cause.\" Over the course of the week, Sinclair stations will air fire preparedness stories and provide viewers useful safety tips through social media and the web.\nThe Red Cross Home Fire Campaign is a multi-year effort to significantly reduce home fire deaths and injuries. The Red Cross and its partners have installed more than 125,000 smoke alarms in nearly 2,400 cities and towns. In the past year alone the Red Cross has made 63,000 families safer thanks to the smoke alarms and safety education received by Red Cross volunteers and community partners.\n\"Local broadcasting is one of the most important ways we share life-saving information with the communities we serve. Our campaigns are local, our volunteers are local, our supporting partners are local, and broadcast TV just connects all those dots,\" said Russ Paulsen , Executive Director of Community Preparedness for the Red Cross. \"Being able to speak to over 43 million homes at once through Sinclair's media network allows us to scale our effort to educate families about preventing home fires and keeping loved ones safe.\"\nAbout the American Red Cross:\nThe American Red Cross shelters, feeds and provides emotional support to victims of disasters; supplies about 40 percent of the nation's blood; teaches skills that save lives; provides international humanitarian aid; and supports military members and their families.
