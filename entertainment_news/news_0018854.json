They were inspired by their mother, Amanda who died from cancer last year.\nDempsey told the Sun Journal that coming home for the Dempsey Challenge is like coming home for a family reunion, sharing memories, grief, accomplishments and support.\n\"The overall feeling and openness of everyone participating in the challenge is magical,\" he said.\nHe was joined at the event's annual Cancer Survivors' Walk on Saturday by Joan Lunden, a journalist and television host who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2014. She told the crowd of walkers and runners that the \"unsung heroes\" are the nurses and volunteers who help cancer patients in their journey.\nOn Sunday, Dempsey will be participating in a 50-mile ride.\nDempsey is best known as Dr. Derek \"McDreamy\" Shepherd on TV's \"Grey's Anatomy,\" but he left the show earlier this year and put his focus on his racing team, Dempsey Proton Racing. In addition to racing, he's filming the movie \"Bridget Jones's Baby\" in London.\nAbout 4,000 people were participating in the challenge. The goal is to break the 2014 record of $1.41 million raised by 3,871 participants, said Aimee Arsenault Labbe, the Dempsey Center's manager of special events and development.\n___\nOnline:\nhttp://www.dempseycenter.org/the-dempsey-challenge/ \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
