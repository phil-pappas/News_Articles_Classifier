It's gonna be scary but not too scary for them. â€¦ Luckily their parents probably read \"Goosebumps\" when they were kids.\" Jeremy Jahns said. \n\"Each scene is taken seriously enough that I think kids are gonna get into it and I think adults (like ourselves) are actually gonna be able to fully enjoy this as a good old fashioned Halloween slumber party movie.\" Crave's William Bibbiani said on What the Flick?! \nWhich was essential for a movie like \"Goosebumps.\" R.L. Stine has been terrifying kids with his novels for 23 years, so those that are most familiar with his work are more likely to have kids than be kids. (Video via CNN ) \nThree weeks in, \"The Martian\" brought in an estimated $21.5 million during a very competitive weekend. \nIt's also doing well abroad, managing $175 million overseas and it hasn't even released in China yet. \nTaking the third spot at the box office, is Spielberg's \"Bridge of Spies\" bringing in an estimated $15 million. \nWith Tom Hanks commanding the lead role and Steven Spielberg behind the lense, \"Bridge of Spies\" is sure to be 2016 Oscars bait. That hasn't made it a box office success. \nThe film doesn't rank in the top 15 openings for Hanks, and if you adjust for inflation it's one of the worst debuts of Spielberg's 40-year career. \nThat said, critically there's been nothing but praise for the film. TIME writes , \"In his fourth pairing with Hanks, Spielberg again examines the furtive face of justice and issues another masterful ruling.\" \nAs for next week, Vin Diesel trades in his Dodge Charger for a bow and arrow??", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T02:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:41:49.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
