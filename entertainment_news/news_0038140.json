Hours earlier, a fan had posted an Instagram image showing the comedian with his hand heavily wrapped in what appeared to be gauze covering.\nFallon, 41, was in Cambridge to receive the student-run Harvard Lampoon magazine's Elmer Award for Excellence in Humor and be crowned \"Emperor of Comedy,\" a ritual in which the recipient is paraded around Harvard Square in a Roman chariot. Past recipients have included John Cleese, Billy Crystal, Jay Leno, Tracey Ullman and Robin Williams.\nAt some point, as a fan's Instagram video shows, a tuxedoed Fallon is shaking hands with a large crowd of well-wishers, then turns with a bottle of JÃ¤germeister in one hand and suddenly falls forward. A crash is heard and as onlookers help him up, Fallon looks at his outstretched hand.\nPeople magazine said Sunday that Fallon was taken by limousine to Massachusetts General Hospital in nearby Boston. After being treated, he returned to the Harvard event, with a fan's Instagram photo showing the comedian with another celebrant.\nThe injury was of particular concern since the comedian nearly severed a finger on his left hand in June, requiring what his representative called minor surgery.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T04:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T10:48:30.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
