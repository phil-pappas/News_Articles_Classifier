According to TMZ , the couple is buying a house together. Sources tell the site that they have placed a bid on a stunning nine-bedroom pad in the Hollywood Hills. It's still unclear if Nicki and Meek will get the property, but the fact they even attempted is \"a sign they're on solid ground.\" According to sources, the \"Anaconda\" hitmaker hasn't had a place to call home after selling her old L.A. pad she used to live in with her ex Safaree Samuels. Meek is also ready to move from Philadelphia to California because \"it's better for biz ... and he thinks it'll keep him out of trouble.\" The source claims Nicki and Meek are \"definitely in love\" and \"there's even talk of marriage, but no proposal yet.\" The pair may have a celebration party in the new house if it happens. Nicki went public with her relationship with Meek back in February. In late July, the couple was hit with split rumors . The rumors, however, was debunked by the \"Super Bass\" rapper in August. Nicki then sparked pregnancy rumors after calling Meek her \"baby father\" during a concert in Pennsylvania. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T11:12:18.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
