Talking to Express, her grandson, Dr Rajarajan said, “It is true. She is no more. She died a natural death an hour-and-a-half ago. When I first saw her, I suspected the worst. Still, I rushed her to the hospital, but it was in vain.” The comedienne, who had gone through bouts of illness, had recovered and was showing signs of improvement. Only last week, she had met a group of media representatives. The veteran, who acted in over 1,500 films and stage shows, was a true lover of art and was known for her timing and wit. \nManorama’s sense of timing and wit made her win the hearts of scores of film lovers. At a time when top male actors with towering personalities ruled the industry, Manorama was able to make her mark and stand her own, competing with doyens such as MGR, Sivaji and others, move for move. \nManorama had always considered Maalayitta Mangai, in which she made her debut in 1957, as her life-changing film. The actress never had any regrets in life. Interestingly, she had once remarked that if at all she had an opportunity to be born again, she would like to be born as herself. Fans across the globe will now hope and pray it happens. \nOfficials at the Apollo Hospital said she died of a cardiac arrest, and was brought dead to the hospital. She was formally declared dead at 11.45 pm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:22:12.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
