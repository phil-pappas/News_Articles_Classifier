AP Photo - Damian Dovarganes Local Real Estate Cars For Sale \nACCORDING to current Playmate, Carla Howe, the Playboy mansion is following the lead of the magazine and taking a turn for the modest. \nHugh Hefner is reportedly more interested in playing chess than having orgies and the mansion, once famous for extravagant parties with the rich and the famous, is more retirement home than hedonist playground. \nHowe said there are now more nurses than playmates as Hefner, 89, opts for quiet nights. Hefner is reportedly so frail he always has a nurse by his side.

Howe said it's \"like being in prison.\" editors picks", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:19:56.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
