You have to get an artiste, then convince a producer, you have to wait for the right release date... This process will at least take a year, especially if you are an upcoming director. So, I thought I should wrap up a film in very short time. To do so, we spent three months on the pre-production and shot this film in just eight days, in Chennai and Thoothukudi,\" he reveals.\nTalking about the film, Rahul, who is a fan of Hitchock's thrillers, says that it is a murder mystery. \"The plot revolves around the hero, who thinks that he has committed a murder. Only later he realizes that the crime was committed by someone else and tries to solve it and clear his name,\" he says and adds that he has chosen talented aspiring actors and koothupattarai artistes for the five characters in the film.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:20:46.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
