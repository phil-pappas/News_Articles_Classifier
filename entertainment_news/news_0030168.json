On late Thursday night, October 1, the 23-year-old singer made the track called \"Me & the Rhythm\" available as free download for fans who pre-order her upcoming LP. On the '80s-inspired disco/pop tune produced by Swedish duo Mattman and Robin, Gomez shows off her sultry vocals as she sings about taking over the dance floor. \"When I move my body I don't have to talk about none/ Let the chemicals go do its stuff 'Til the energy is too much,\" she coos before adding in the chorus, \"Yeah all I need is the rhythm, me and the rhythm, nothing between.\" \"Me & the Rhythm\" is the third song to have surfaced from Gomez's \"Revival\" album, which is due out on October 9. It follows the A$AP Rocky -assisted \"Good for You\" and \"Same Old Love\" that was co-penned by Charli XCX . To promote her first release under Interscope, Gomez is touring the U.S. and Canada starting from May to July next year. Dates for the trek will be unveiled on Monday, October 5. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T10:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:28:16.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
