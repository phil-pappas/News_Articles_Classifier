Die Hard 6 is coming but SOMEONE ELSE is playing John McClane – bye bye Bruce Willis? DIE HARD 6 will be a prequel featuring John McClane as a young man - but is it possible to make the film without Bruce Willis as the iconic action hero? PUBLISHED: 13:33, Thu, Oct 15, 2015 | UPDATED: 15:16, Thu, Oct 15, 2015 SG Bruce Willis in Die Hard \nThe simple answer is that anything is possible. \nThe practical answer is that this is Hollywood and risks are rarely taken. \nDie Hard with Willis would belike Terminator without Arnie (although Schwarzenegger may be wishing he'd stayed out of the atrocious Genisys). Related articles Daniel Craig banks £39 MILLION for SPECTRE but doesn't 'give a... \nBut how will they do it? \nDie Hard 6 will be set in 1979 and no amount of make-up and digital trickery will convince us that Brucie is a man of 25. SG Smoking hot: who else could play John McClane? \nThe film will introduce McClane as a regular NYPD cop who endures a traumatic baptsim of fire. \nThis will doubtless frustrate fans who know full well that the entire concept of 1988's original film is based on the extraordinary actons of a hitherto unremarkable cop. \nLatest reports suggest that the new instalment will somehow also incorporate scenes which show the present day McClane, and thus allow Willis to take part. Our money is on a trusty flashback scenario, perhaps with Willis opening the film. \nIt is likely that this may be the swan song for Willis in the role as producers attempt to reboot the franchise with a new young star. SG Bruce Willis with on-screen son Jai Courtney in A Good Day To Die Hard \nIt certainly spells bad new for Jai Courtney and his hopes for a spin off from A Good Day To Die Hard. \nIt was hoped that the 2013 film would be the starting point for a new chapter in the series, with Courtney playing McClane's son Jack, opposite Willis. \nPoor reviews savaged the enterprise, although it clocked up a respectable $305 million (£198 million) at the box office. \nCourtney hasn't been having much luck with blockbusters, recently. The latest news suggess that his poorly-received Terminator: Genisys will not be getting either of the two projected sequels. \nWillis, himslef, has had a bumpy ride at the movies recently, especially off-screen. \nHis temper has seen him famously storm out of interviews and bark at photographers. \nThe star was also embroiled in a huge drama when Sylvester Stallone publically denounced Bruce Willis' high salary demands for Expendables 3. \nDirector Kevin Smith publically retells horror stories of working with Willis on Cop Out while another director, AntoineFuqua, described him as \" a pain in the ass' on set for for 2003's Tears of the Sun. \nMost recently, he was fired from the upcoming (as yet untitled) Woody Allen film and replaced with Steve Carell. \nWillis has a far better relationship with the director of the new Die Hard film, Len Wiseman. \nThe two worked together successfully on 2007's Live Free or Die Hard which remains the highest grossing film in the series so far. \nThe new film also has high-octane blockbuster credentials with Lorenze di Bonaventura on board as producer.
