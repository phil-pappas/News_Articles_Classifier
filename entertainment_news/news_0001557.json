The concept of a free art show in a public park arose from a partnership between the art center, the Ann Arbor Area Community Foundation and philanthropists and artists Larry and Lucie Nisson.\nLucie Nisson says the partners were inspired by organizations like the New York-based ArtPlace, which promotes integrating the arts into all aspects of a community. As Nisson sees it, POP-X is just the beginning of a larger ambition.\n“Part of our goal is to fill Ann Arbor with art, so this is a step in the direction of that,” she says. “We want outdoor art. We want art that can be enjoyed by everybody.”\nOrganizers picked a rather politically charged site for the show. Liberty Plaza is a gathering place for Ann Arbor’s homeless, and a redesign of the park has long been the subject of debate at city council meetings. One of POP-X’s featured artists, Ypsilanti resident Nick Azzaro, will seek to directly address public perception of the park. Azzaro’s contribution to the show will feature portraits of some of Liberty Plaza’s regular visitors, photographed in a small studio he set up in the park.\nIn his work, Azzaro noticed that many passers-by simply ignore Liberty Plaza. He says he wanted to combat the “stigma” associated with the park.\n“I hope that this might make (visitors) look at the people who occupy this space as humans,” he says. “I know it’s not as simple as that, but I would like to make a connection.”\nWork showcased in the other pavilions will cover a variety of subjects. Chazz Miller’s exhibit will feature painted butterflies (he spread them throughout Detroit in a 2010 project), while Kate Robertson will present small sculptures that require audiences to look through a portal to voyeuristically view an interior space.\nSome pavilions will feature collaborative efforts. Young participants from Girls Group, a nonprofit working to empower young Washtenaw County women to graduate high school and college, will offer their artistic representations of the concept of “home.”\nPOP-X also includes a variety of free public programming throughout Ann Arbor, in what Rush describes as another extension of the project’s mission to “expand the accessibility of the arts for everybody in our community.”\nEvents will range from a theater performance by Ypsilanti-based Neighborhood Theatre Group to a lunchtime “Art for Innovators” speaking series, exploring ways for businesses to incorporate art and artistic thinking into their operations.\nIf the show proves successful, organizers envision a recurring event that could extend showcase a broader swath of the community.\n\nPOP-X \nOct. 15-24\nLiberty Plaza\nCorner of Division and Liberty\nAnn Arbor\nFree\n(734) 994-8004\npopxannarbor.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T22:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:29:47.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
