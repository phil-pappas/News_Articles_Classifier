The star has more than 2 million Twitter followers, and nearly as many on Facebook and Instagram. \nHer cousin, Sen. Charles Schumer, knows that. \nOn Sunday, they stood together in front of New York's City Hall for what they call their \"crusade on guns.\" \nIt started in August, when they teamed up days after a gunman fatally shot two women in a Louisiana theater showing \"Trainwreck,\" starring Amy Schumer. The Schumers urged lawmakers to back a gun control bill sponsored by the New York Democrat. \nNow, they're trying to create a national groundswell forcing a vote. They're asking people to call, write, tweet and post on Facebook to stop gun violence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T00:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:44:55.656+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
