And in a country roiled by questions of immigration and identity, \"The Great British Bake Off\" has produced a new heroine - a headscarf-wearing Muslim woman who's a genius with sugar, eggs and flour.\nNadiya Hussain was crowned winner of the contest on a program Wednesday night that was watched by 13.4 million people, a fifth of the British population.\nThe 30-year-old student and mother of three from Leeds in northern England beat two other finalists with her enticing iced buns, perfect raspberry millefeuille and a lemon-drizzle wedding cake wrapped in a sari in the red, white and blue of the Union Jack.\nHussain told the BBC on Thursday that winning the show - pre-recorded in June - was \"one of the best moments of my life.\"\nHussain said she made her winning creation - which she dubbed her \"big fat British wedding cake\" - because she didn't have a cake when she got married in Bangladesh 10 years ago.\n\"Just because I'm not a stereotypical British person, it doesn't mean that I am not into bunting, cake and tea,\" she said.\nMillions of fans followed Hussain's progress through the series, wincing as she cried over her failed vol au vents and gasping at her resplendent chocolate peacock cake.\nHer victory in the final over 41-year-old photographer Ian Cumming and 30-year-old doctor Tamal Ray was hailed by fans as an inspiring symbol of 21st-century Britain.\nSince it first aired in 2010, \"Bake Off\" has combined old-fashioned Britishness with a diverse roster of contestants - gay and straight, male and female and from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds.\nIts fans include Prime Minister David Cameron, who backed Nadiya to win and in a speech Wednesday called Britain \"the proudest multi-racial democracy on Earth.\"\nBut immigration and its effects have become a troubling issue for Britain in the last decade, as newcomers - many from eastern Europe - have arrived in the hundreds of thousands.\nThe anti-immigrant U.K. Independence Party has gained millions of votes in local and national elections. And the country's interior minister, Home Secretary Theresa May, said this week in a heavily criticized speech that mass immigration was incompatible with a cohesive society.\nThe spread of violent international jihad, which has seen hundreds of young Britons join the Islamic State group, has also put the country's 2.7 million Muslims under an unwanted spotlight.\nThe Muslim Association of Britain said Hussain's victory \"has demonstrated the connection that young British Muslims have with British society. The hijab that she wears has not deterred her from participating and winning the show.\"\nHomespun and slightly hokey, \"The Great British Bake Off\" seems an unlikely cultural sensation.\nIn surroundings reminiscent of a village summer fair - a marquee tent on the grassy lawn of an elegant country house - contestants toil over baking challenges, then offer their creations for judgment to gimlet-eyed cookbook writer Mary Berry and bluff master baker Paul Hollywood.\nTwo hosts, comedians Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc, add encouragement and saucy, innuendo-laden humor. Unlike most reality shows, the tone is supremely good-natured - there are no \"Apprentice\"-style insults here.\nThe show had a modest start, but ratings rose from about 3 million viewers for the first series to 10 million by the fifth. Now its weekly micro-dramas regularly set social media alight, and sales of baking books and cake tins have soared.\nThe format has been copied in other countries, including Australia, Sweden, Turkey, France and the United States. But in the U.K. it has become a phenomenon, attuned to the \"do-it-yourself\" spirit of post-Great Recession Britain.\nJosh Abrams, a lecturer at Roehampton University who specializes in food and performance, said it was perfect fare for \"an age when we're all digitized and spending so much of our time in front of screens.\"\n\"The idea of getting your hands dirty - whether physically in the dirt of your backyard or mixing things in a kitchen - speaks to a nostalgia for a notion of a simpler time,\" he said.\n___\nFollow Jill Lawless on Twitter at http://Twitter.com/JillLawless \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
