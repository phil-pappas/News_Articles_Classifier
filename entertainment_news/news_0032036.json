But Burnett's 1990 film, \"To Sleep with Anger,\" is nearly as evocative – leisurely but sly. An enigmatic country vagabond (Danny Glover, never better) reunites with old friends (Paul Butler and Mary Alice) now living in South Central LA. A potent clash of urban and rural personalities ensues, spiced with the supernatural. Peculiar in tone in the best way, \"To Sleep with Anger\" will be screened in honor of director Burnett, scheduled to introduce the picture and to receive the festival’s Career Achievement Award. \n5 p.m. Sunday, AMC River East 21, 322 E. Illinois St. Tickets $11-$14 at chicagofilmfestival.com . Running time: 1:42. \n-Michael Phillips", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T22:42:47.575+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
