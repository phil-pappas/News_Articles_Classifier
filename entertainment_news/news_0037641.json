The couple was photographed sharing a passionate smooch while out on a date night in Beverly Hills last week. Pinto and Bacardi were caught on camera waiting in line at specialty ice cream shop Salt & Straw after having dinner at nearby Brazilian steakhouse Fogo de Chao. The two were seen sporting casual outfits for the outing with the actress wearing a printed jumper and black blazer and Bacardi in a T-shirt, jeans, and backwards baseball cap. Photos of them enjoying the date night have surfaced all over the web. However, a rep for the \" Slumdog Millionaire \" actress declined to comment on the budding relationship. Earlier this month, Pinto and Bacardi enjoyed a romantic getaway to Vancouver where they celebrated the actress' birthday. Bacardi shared a snap from the trip on his Instagram page.
