She wants council to just do it, but lawmakers for the moment aren't budging because they fear the legislation could lead to the city being overrun by ads.\nTheir imagination at work has a banner on City Hall asking, \"What's in your wallet?\"\nMore: Columns by David Andreatta\nCourt precedent bars ads on city halls and other public property whose primary function is the people's work, but lawmakers are concerned that once you pop, you can't stop and that the mayor's proposal could be a slippery slope.\nIt's the betcha can't eat just one principle.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nShould we put ads on city property?\nThey're also wondering, where's the beef? The measure contained no details on how much revenue the so-called City Asset Advertising Program might generate.\n\"What we got is pretty loosey-goosey,\" said Council Member Carolee Conklin, whose Finance Committee hosted a public hearing on the bill on Tuesday . \"It raises more questions than it answers.\"\nAmong them: Will neighborhood associations have a say in what ads go up? Does selling signage imply city endorsement of a product? Are you in good hands?\nUnder the legislation, a five-person committee would oversee the program. Four would be City Hall officials and the City Council president would reach out and touch someone to be the fifth by appointment.\nIn a letter to council, Warren made clear the ads won't be everywhere you want to be; just some places. She wrote that ads would target special events, parking garages and something called \"non-permanent fixtures at city-owned facilities.\"\nThat's hardly a list that keeps going and going and going. But imagine how quickly those already ubiquitous ads that ask, \"Hurt in a car?\" or urge, \"Don't wait, call 8,\" could multiply under the parking garage provision.\nHow do you spell relief?\nJames Smith, the city's communications director, said ad revenue generated by the program would relieve overburdened taxpayers who, like anyone, want to save money, live better.\nHe likened the program to the type of marketing initiatives in place at the Greater Rochester International Airport, where ads on the terminal and garage net the Monroe County Airport Authority upward of $574,000 a year.\nThat's not huge, Rochester, huge — and no one at City Hall is suggesting its proposal would rake in as much — but it's something for the city to consider at a time when taxpayers don't want to pay any more taxes.\nMunicipal marketing programs have been around for years, yet they're invariably met with skepticism when introduced to a new locale. The Flower City-Flour City is no exception, and for good reason.\nMany people, like those of the group Monroe County People for Parks, wonder where the line will be drawn. Who wants to walk in Durand Eastman Park and be reminded that your lawn is hungry and you have to feed it?\nWhen Chicago draped its iconic Wabash Avenue Bridge with Bank of America ads in 2011, the move was derided as a \"a visual crime,\" \"commercial graffiti,\" and \"a grotesque cheapening of the public realm.\"\nBut that program took a licking and kept on ticking, just like those of so many other cities from Los Angeles to New York because, as the Chicago Sun-Times put it, the ads, while unappealing, \"beat going bust.\"\nRochester will probably follow suit. Before it does, though, City Council should stand like a rock until the program's potential and limits are better defined, lest it open the door to shrink-wrapping the entire city like a Regional Transit Service bus.\nAfter its Bank of America disaster, Chicago drafted what reads like a clear and sensible mission statement that addresses things like protecting that city's visual integrity, oversaturation of outdoor advertising, and less being more.\nSometimes you need a little finesse. Sometimes you need a lot.\nSmith said City Hall wants to emulate the tasteful municipal marketing on display in world-class cities and is open to more discussion. That's good because City Council has been inundated with emails about the bill and none of them said, \"I'm lovin' it.\"\nTheir sentiment was more, \"Can you hear me now?\"*\nDANDREATTA@Gannett.com\n*In this column, David Andreatta gives a nod to the well-known slogans of 24 companies and enterprises.
