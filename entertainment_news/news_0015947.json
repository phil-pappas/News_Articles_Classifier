Ben Affleck (Paul A Hebert/AP) \nBen’s casting proved to be controversial for some fans of the franchise, but Zack said all their fears will be calmed when they see his performance. \nSpeaking on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, where Batman’s creator Bob Kane was honoured with a posthumous star, Zack assured naysayers: “Ben is the best Batman in my opinion. Just look at him.” \nHe added: “Ben brings so much. He brings gravitas, he is serious, he’s an amazing actor and he has got the size. I’m a big fan. He is all of 6’4″ and that is real Batman in my opinion.” \nKane created The Batman in 1939 in a New York art studio and his character has become the star of comic books, numerous TV series and some of the highest-grossing films of all time. \nChristian Bale, George Clooney, Michael Keaton and Val Kilmer are among the actors who have taken on the role on the big screen. Promoted stories \nAfter unveiling Kane’s star alongside DC Entertainment co-publisher Jim Lee, Zack said: “Batman has always been one of my favourite comic book heroes and 75 years ago Bob created an enduring character that clearly is beloved throughout the world. It’s an honour for me to be one of the guys who gets to say he’s cool.” Batman creator Bob Kane has been honoured (Eric Charbonneau/Invision) \nAddressing the large crowd gathered on Hollywood Boulevard to watch the ceremony, Zack described the first time he saw Ben in costume on camera. \n“I was having him turn and look around and be Batman-ish and it was amazing because I felt in that moment that I had achieved the goal that I had set out for myself, he was the perfect personification of the Batman I had in my mind. \n“But the truth is, he wasn’t really the Batman that I had imagined, because Bob had really put him there in my mind, through years of TV shows, comic books and movies. I realised every single one of us has an imaginary Batman in our minds, lurking in the shadows. That is real and that is Bob’s legacy, 75 years of Batman and he has given this gift to all of us.” Share article \nBatman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice will open in UK cinemas on March 25, 2016.
