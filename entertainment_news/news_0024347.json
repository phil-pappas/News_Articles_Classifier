Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 chopped red onion. Cook until softened, 5 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons chopped parsley, 1 teaspoon each fresh chopped dill and capers, and pepper to taste. Cook, 1 minute.

Toss pasta in a large bowl with the sauce. Makes: 4 servings\nRecipe by Carol Mighton Haddix\nThe wines\nPairings by sommelier Rachael Lowe, wine director of Spiaggia and Spiaggia Cafe in Chicago, as told to Michael Austin:\nNV Pierre Gimonnet Brut Blanc de Blancs, Premier Cru, Cuis, France: This Champagne is made of 100 percent chardonnay from the Cotes des Blancs. Aged in stainless steel, it is a very clean and refreshing wine, evoking aromas of green apple, pear, almond skin and a chalky minerality. It will balance the herbaceous notes of the dish, while the acidity will cut through the fleshy fish and creaminess of the chowder and pasta.\n2014 Domaine Sigalas Assyrtiko, Santorini, Greece: From a winery founded by Paris Sigalas in 1991 and dedicated to the organic production of native grape varieties, especially assyrtiko, this is a savory wine, with notes of lemon pith, lime blossom, tarragon, wet stone and a briny finish. It will pair beautifully with the clam and tuna component of the dish while mirroring the vegetal notes of the parsley and dill.\n2012 Terre Nere Calderara Sottana, Etna Rosso, Sicily, Italy: This red is a blend of nerello mascalese and nerello cappuccio grapes. It is elegant, focused and savory, with aromas of red currant, raspberry and red apple skin intermingled with secondary notes of dried sage, thyme, mushroom and a hint of smoke. Its lighter body will not mask the seafood flavors in the dish, while the dried herbs will balance the greens, and the acidity will cut the richness.\nPrivacy Policy Recipes", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5627f706/turbine/sc-wine-pairing-seafood-pasta-food-1023-20151021"], "published": "2015-10-21T23:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:14:25.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
