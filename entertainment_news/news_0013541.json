Objection, your Honor.\nA court case in Ireland was suspended after a man mooned at the judge and spanked his own butt, before waving his penis around.\nThe bizarre pants-down protest began when Judge Patrick Durcan refused the man’s brother bail during an assault case.\nThe 24-year-old stunned Ennis District Court with his revealing display, which sparked a ruck with police inside the court room.\nAs cops struggled to maintain order, reinforcements were called to deal with the man and his 18-year-old brother as court business was suspended for 20 minutes\nWhen the two men had been placed in handcuffs, the hearing resumed and Judge Durcan remanded the pair in custody.\nIrish police also cleared the court of family and friends of the two who had been present for the earlier hearing.\nInspector Tom Kennedy described the situation in court as \"tense and explosive\" and said that he was \"horrified\" by what he had witnessed.\n\"What happened in court today was unbelievable,” he said, reported Mirror Online .\n“To see someone moon at a judge and then show his genitals to the court and hold them in his hand was an affront to the administration of justice in the court. Why someone would do that, I just don't know.\n“In all my time working in court, I never seen an indecent display like I witnessed today.”\nInsp. Kennedy said that he had witnessed a number of disturbances in court over the years, but never anything where such disrespect was shown to the justice system.\nlhanna@nydailynews.com", "external_links": ["http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/man-waves-penis-about-moons-6693788"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T15:48:54.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
