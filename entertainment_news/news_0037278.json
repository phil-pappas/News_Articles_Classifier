Now, the Canadian rocker is back with 'Get Up', which he believes is the ideal follow-up to 'Reckless'. SOUNDBITE, musician, Bryan Adams, saying (English): \"I don't actually know what my target audience is and I don't know anything about the music business so I just do what I do which is make music which is what I've always done.\" But it's not just music Bryan creates. He has a lot more strings to his bow. SOUNDBITE, musician, Bryan Adams, saying (English): \"If it's not music, it's a video, if it's not a video, it's an album cover, if it's not an album cover, it's a photo shoot, if it's not a photoshoot, it's a song. If it's not a song, it's working on something in the house. There's always something going on. It just takes you out of frame for a minute into something else so when you come back into it you have a fresh perspective.\" \"Get Up\" is released worldwide on October 16.
