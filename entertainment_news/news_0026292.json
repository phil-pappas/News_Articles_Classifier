Huh/ASSOCIATED PRESS \"Barney's Great Adventure\" is just one of many movies perpetually banned in Asia. The Thai government banned a locally-made horror film, “ Arbat ,” for being disrespectful to the sacred lives of monks, according to reports.\nThe film — which is about a young man who becomes a monk and then forges a romantic relationship with a village girl — was slated for release in Asia on Thursday.\nAs shocking as it is for some, it’s hardly the first time a film has been stopped from seeing the light of day — or, rather, the darkness of a theater. And sometimes it’s for more trivial reasons.\n“Barney’s Great Adventure”\nA movie featuring the world’s most famous purple dinosaur was banned in Malaysia, where it was deemed “ unacceptable for children to watch .”\nNo other threatening reasons about the singing dinosaur’s 1998 movie have been explained since.\n“Back to the Future”\n©Universal/courtesy Everett Collection \"Back to the Future\" features characters in the movie time traveling, which is a no-go in China. Believe it or not, the Michael J. Fox classic film “Back to the Future” can never be viewed in China’s movie theaters.\nAny movies or television shows that highlight time travel are forbidden by the Chinese government, and this includes the 1985 movie.\n“Ted”\nPhoto Credit: Universal Pictures/Tippett Studio Creator Seth MacFarlane's \"Ted\" can never been viewed in Malaysia. Malaysia really does not like stuffed talking animals on the big screen.\nSeth MacFarlane’s potty-mouthed stuffed bear named Ted is banned for its “ iffy ” content and its creator, who is also responsible for the animated hit television show “Family Guy,” which is heavily censored in the country.\n“Sex and the City 2”\nCraig Blankenhorn/Craig Blankenhorn The word \"Sex\" in the title for the movie \"Sex and the City 2\" was enough to repel the government of Abu Dhabi. “Sex and the City 2” is off limits in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates.\nDuring the movie, its four leading ladies travel to Abu Dhabi, which is portrayed as a glamorous and exotic getaway.\nYet, as history shows, the capital is known for its ill treatment against women.\nIn the end, “Sex and the City 2,” was too racy in its title and some of the skin-baring fashion Sarah Jessica Parker and company wear throughout the movie for Abu Dhabi to accept.", "external_links": ["http://variety.com/2015/film/asia/thailand-bans-arbat-movie-on-religious-grounds-1201616394/", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/china-bans-time-travel-films-177801", "http://geektyrant.com/news/5-films-banned-for-ridiculous-reasons-mjgt", "http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/may/18/sex-and-the-city-2-abu-dhabi", "http://illusion.scene360.com/movies/72891/banned-movies-comedies/", "http://knowledgenuts.com/2013/09/06/time-travel-is-banned-in-chinese-movies/", "http://moviepilot.com/posts/2014/07/16/8-movies-banned-for-your-safety-the-reasons-why-will-shock-you-1407350?lt_source=external,manual", "http://www.bangkokpost.com/lifestyle/art-and-culture/film"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:30:50.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
