We love to have a laugh.\" \nMielczarek was one of 14 suitors 26-year-old Frost met on the reality dating show. But he nearly wasn't one of them, initially turning down the offer to appear on the show. \n\"I didn't want to commit until I knew who the girls was,\" he said. \n\"When Sam was announced that morning - I still remember it was Wednesday the 29 th of April - I immediately got on the emails and asked if there was a spot for me.\" \nLuckily for him and Frost, who went on the show to move on from her very public break up with Bachelor Blake Garvey last year, he got a second chance. \n\"It was love at first sight I think for both of us,\" he said. \n\"I used to be the guy who would sit back at home going 'what an idiot how can you fall in love on national television?' But it does happen and (I've learned) you can never rule anything out.\" \nThe Bachelorette has been a ratings winner for Channel 10, in some ways out-performing the show which inspired it, The Bachelor. \nChannel 10 today confirmed a second season of The Bachelorette will go into production next year. channel 10", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:17:05.895+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
