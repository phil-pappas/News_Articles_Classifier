We’re swapping sweetness for bitchiness, soggy bottoms for sharp suits, and it just might take us a while to adjust.\nEighteen candidates are now installed in a posh London townhouse waiting to show Lord Sugar that they can apparently give 110% and that winning the show is their ultimate goal. They are almost outdoing The X Factor contestants in terms of gushing and hyperbole.\nShare article One of the candidates, 21 year old Elle, describes herself as “a little insane”.

Amongst these dubious qualifications are candidates who seem, at this early stage before their hideous personalities have leaked out, impressive, such as Vana who speaks five languages and used to sell her toys on the streets of New York as a seven-year old entrepreneur.
