Both teams are evenly matched, which should make for a great game.\n4.00pm - Pool B: South Africa vs Scotland\nKick-off: 4.45pm\nSt. James Park\nThe first of the day's big, big games. What should have been a pool decider is now a must win game for South Africa if they want to avoid a shock early exit. The Scottish have never beaten South Africa outside of Scotland, but with the game taking place just over the border in Newcastle they are guaranteed to have strong support providing 16th man advantage.\n7.00pm - Pool A: England vs Australia\nKick-Off 8.00pm\nTwickenham\nThis show down between England and Australia was always going to big game, but for England it is now their biggest game of the tournament. If they lose, they are most probably out of their own World Cup, which would be mighty embarrassing. The Twickenham crowd will be in full voice, but that's not going intimidate the Australian team who will be focused on staying on track to win the pool. It's a game not to be missed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T18:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T13:27:30.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
