Youtube.com Few disagree that one of the saddest things a parent could ever do would be to bury their own child. Mrs. Patricia Smith of San Diego, California had to do exactly that three years ago. Pat understands how her son, Sean Smith , died. What has her angry and frustrated is that she was never told the wherefores and the whys to her son meeting his demise during a terrorist attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya on Sept. 11, 2012.\nAs reported by Andrew Husband of the new media Mediaite news portal on Oct. 21, 2015, Mrs. Smith appeared live earlier that same day on the program CNN Newsroom hosted by Carol Costello. When asked what questions she would like answered by former Secretary of State and current Democratic Party front runner for president Hillary Clinton at the upcoming House Special Committee on Benghazi hearing, Mrs. Smith didn't exactly hold back years of pent up anger and frustration.\nIt was on Sept. 11, 2012 that the US Ambassador to Libya J. Christopher Stevens, Foreign Service Information Management Officer and US Air Force veteran Sean Smith, CIA contractors and former US Navy SEALs Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty were killed in Benghazi, reportedly by terrorists belonging to the Ansar al-Sharia Islamic jihadist organization. That same terrorist group has long ago pledged their allegiance to al-Qaeda, the same Islamic jihadists who attacked the United States on Sept. 11, 2001, killing thousands.\nEarly in Costello's interview she appeared to be somewhat shocked and taken aback when Patricia Smith revealed that she actually didn’t have all that much information regarding what happened to her son, and as Husband noted, \"despite the fact that the Benghazi attack occurred three years ago.\" A noticeably angered Smith accused Clinton of promising to “get back to” her following her son’s funeral ceremony in Washington, D.C. According to Mrs. Smith, no one had since contacted her on the matter.\n“She has not called me. She has not contacted me. She has not given me any information,” she said, “except to tell me that I am not a member of the immediate family and I do not need to know.”\nA somewhat stunned Costello asked, “They told you that?” Smith responded, \"Yes they did. A number of times. Over and over.\" Costello could be heard saying under her breath \"Oh, my goodness.\"\nIt was then that Costello played a video clip from Clinton’s testimony before the US Senate in January 2013. While speaking under oath, Clinton said that it was their job “to figure out what happened and do everything [they could] to prevent it from happening again.”\nHolding little back, Mrs. Smith angrily yelled, “She’s lying! She’s absolutely lying!” The still grieving mother again repeated her claim that despite being the mother of a slain State Department official, she still hasn’t been updated on anything since her son's funeral ceremony because they didn’t consider her a member of the immediate family.\n“I saw on TV the bloody fingerprints on the walls over there. I asked specifically, ‘Are those my son’s fingerprints crawling down the walls?'” she cried. “Somebody’s got to tell me!”", "external_links": ["https://youtu.be/Etykig0XE5A", "http://www.mediaite.com/tv/mother-of-benghazi-victim-erupts-at-hillary-clinton-shes-lying/"], "published": "2015-10-22T12:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:37:04.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
