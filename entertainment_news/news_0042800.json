It’s satisfying for fans of the genre.” \nSuper-fan Helen Newman agreed, saying: “I loved it. It’s old-fashioned Bond. The humour is brilliant.” \nBut others were disappointed with the latest offering. \nPress Association film critic Damon Smith said: “From Skyfall to crestfallen. It was one anticlimax to another although it was beautifully shot.” \nDarryl Smith from Scotland’s Sunday Post called it “lacklustre”, while Ming Yeung from Getty said it was “predictable”. \nShowbiz reporter Steve Hargrave said it was “solid and reliable but there were no real shocks or surprises”. \nITN’s Melissa Nathoo added: “It started phenomenally with an impact but it didn’t maintain it. It tried too hard but is still one of the better Bond films in recent times.” \nSpectre reunites Craig, 47, with director Sam Mendes, after 2012’s Skyfall became the highest-grossing Bond film in history. \nHowever, it may be their last 007 adventure together, with the film-maker saying Spectre is likely to be his last Bond film, while Craig has also dropped hints. \nNaomie Harris, Ralph Fiennes and Rory Kinnear return for Spectre, alongside newcomers to the franchise such as Andrew Scott, Dave Bautista and Bond girls Lea Seydoux, Monica Bellucci and Stephanie Sigman. \nSpectre will be released on October 26, the same night of the royal world premiere in London.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:36:53.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
