There are lots of excellent movies in theaters right now and more on the way, so it helps simplify matters to have a movie out there you can feel really great about missing.\nIn fact, do it tonight: Take off your shoes, sit back in a cushy chair and concentrate on the fact that, at that very moment, other people are watching “Crimson Peak,” and you’re not. You’ll feel warm all over.\nAs for the poor souls who can’t take the warning, they will suffer through a long, strangely uninteresting combination of latter-day Jane Austen and just plain disgusting. Director Guillermo del Toro has a penchant for the physically repulsive — he’s like David Cronenberg but lacking the one element that guides and redeems Cronenberg’s vision, genuine neurosis.\nMore Information Crimson Peak\n★½\nQuick take: A gross, pointless ghost tale\nDel Toro just goes for effect, and the effect he seems to be going for here is something like, “Ew, Guillermo, that’s really gross.” When we first meet our heroine, Edith (Mia Wasikowska), she has a gash in her cheek and her hands and face are splashed with blood. “Ghosts are real,” she announces in voiceover.\nA minute later we meet our first ghost, a black skeleton in an elaborate black dress, and with long, leathery tapered black fingers. She’s attacking a little girl in her bed.\nThis notion of ghosts having decomposing flesh marks Guillermo as unclear on the concept of ghosts. Then again, as no one has ever thrown up at the sight of Casper (the friendly ghost), some innovation was necessary.\nGhost incidents continue to haunt Edith’s young life. Indeed, every time she’s alone and relaxed, there’s a weird grinding or groaning sound, and before she knows it, a red, naked thing, half covered in flesh and with big holes in its skull, is coming up through the floorboards and charging at her.\nBut here’s what’s funny, or unintentionally funny: No matter how many times this occurs, she never thinks to say to someone, “Hey, guess what happened to me today!” She’s remarkably capable of putting these incidents out of her mind.\nIn one notable example, less than an hour after a ghost attack, she shows up at a dress ball with a young baronet, and by the time the party’s over, you get the feeling she considers it as an on-balance good night. Sure, a supernatural entity of blood-curdling ugliness materialized, but she did some dancing, had a few laughs. Life is good.\n“Crimson Peak” is set around the turn of the last century. Edith is an upper-class American girl, and her father (Jim Beaver) is one of the important men of the town. Father takes an instant dislike to the handsome English lord ( Tom Hiddleston ) courting his daughter, and he doesn’t much like the lord’s weird sister, Lady Lucille, played with big-eyed, unblinking intensity by Jessica Chastain .\nNeedless to say, Edith is soon married to the lord and living in a mansion in England that is so run down, it snows in the house. There’s a 10-foot gash in the roof. But no sees this as a deal breaker or particularly unusual, including, possibly, the filmmakers.\n“Crimson Peak” drags along for most of its running time, assuming an audience engagement that it can’t inspire. Something is building, some plan is afoot, but it’s difficult to care what it might it be. The only real question of interest is what Chastain is doing here and why she chose a second-banana part. This question is answered at about midway. She’s the only one in the cast who gets to have any fun.\nWatching Chastain channel her inner Joan Crawford is no reason to see “Crimson Peak,” but seeing a generous and abandoned actress go for broke makes the last half almost bearable.\nRunning time: 119 minutes\nMPAA rating: R (profanity, violence, sexual content)", "external_links": ["http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793612/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793608/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793619/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793613/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793606/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793607/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793608/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793612/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793615/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793609/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793619/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793606/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793617/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793617/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793613/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793611/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793611/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793618/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793615/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793610/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793616/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793610/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793618/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793607/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793616/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793609/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T13:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T13:44:41.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
