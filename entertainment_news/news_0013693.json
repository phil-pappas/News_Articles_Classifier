I would hear, 'Who is the real Jessica?' a lot. \n\"They rarely say that about men. They never worry about 'knowing' them.\" \nHowever, one person who she knows she can rely on to see her for who she really is, is her boyfriend of four years, Gian Luca Passi de Preposulo, 33. \nShe shared: \"He's a gentleman. That's very important to me. He's from an old-school Italian family. No one in his family has ever been divorced!\" \nAnd the 38-year-old actress has big plans for the future in regards to her Hollywood career, admitting she'd love to follow in the footsteps of the likes of Christoph Waltz, Jesper Christensen and Javier Bardem to play a Bond villain. \nShe told W magazine: \"One of my goals is to play a villain in a Bond film. \n\"People ask me if I want to be a Bond girl, and I say, 'No, I want to be the villain.' I'm waiting for that call!\" bang showbiz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:03:20.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
