Some of the skits are very similar to the “Benny Hill” T.V. Variety Shows of yesteryear. \"When we interview our artists however we are quite serious about focusing on their story and sharing their artwork and what lead them to create it\" say’s Cameron. \"Our belief is that the vast percentage of the potential buying public is often intimidated by the expectations of understanding art. We feel the need to “take it down a notch” to reach people at the level of what they like about the art and artists without the expectation of having to understand it\".\nThe new state of the art studio is aptly named “Unit 219 Studios” as it resides in our owned space in an industrial complex in Liberty Lake, Washington in Unit 219 states Dean Cameron.
