Fight your corner, because you're sure of yourself and feeling fearless. How far are you prepared to go? Do not convince yourself that the ends justify the means, to the extent that you give yourself permission to behave badly or to arouse the antagonism of others. Not a good idea! Lucky Number Taurus April 20-May 20 \nA certain person is in a right old state. They're obviously spoiling for a row, because they keep correcting what you say or pointing out the flaws in your argument. Any sort of debate or meeting could end in a slanging match, with everyone becoming entrenched in their own opinions and determined not to give an inch. It will be exhausting! Lucky Number Gemini May 21-June 21 \nIt's easy to get bogged down in trivial details, Gemini, so don't lose sight of what you're trying to do, or you won't see the wood for the trees. If you feel that you're drowning in a sea of papers, being bombarded by emails or having to cope with too much information in one go, tackle things in their order of priority so you can protect your sanity. Lucky Number Cancer June 22-July 22 \nA friend is full of enthusiasm today, and it's very infectious. They want to persuade you to do something and they're giving it the hard sell. But don't let yourself be bullied into saying yes. On the other hand, you may be the one who's trying to talk a friend into following your lead, in which case you'll feel irritated if they don't play ball. But why should they? Lucky Number Leo July 23-August 22 \nIf you're still wondering what a certain person was talking about yesterday you'll be anxious to get to the bottom of it today. But try to keep your temper while you're doing it, otherwise you'll give this person a real grilling and that may not be very helpful. You're chasing facts but you're also expecting others to be ultra logical, and that may not be possible for them. Have a heart! Lucky Number Virgo August 23-September 22 \nSomeone's in a very critical and nit-picking mood today, making it hard to talk to them without getting the sharp edge of their tongue. However, there's every chance that this person is you, especially if you're still feeling annoyed about what happened yesterday and you're now trying to get the facts straight. Bullying people or snapping at them won't help the situation, you know. Lucky Number Libra September 23-October 22 \nThere's a sense of urgency about a close relationship today. Maybe you're in a panic that you won't be able to make this person understand how you feel about them, or perhaps the two of you are overcome by passion and everything else has to take second place. There's a strong chance, though, that you'll get slightly irritated with each other at some point. Lucky Number Scorpio October 23 - November 21 \nA certain someone is in a very scratchy and ratty frame of mind today, making it hard to be around them for long without getting your head bitten off. Try not to provoke this person into being even more bad-tempered, because that won't be much fun. You could get caught up in petty details now, so try to cope with the facts without obsessing about them. Lucky Number Sagittarius November 22-December 21 \nYou have a lot on your plate now and it's getting to you. You're trying to do too much and you're wondering how you're going to get it all done in time, or you have bogged down in petty details about something and now you can't think straight. It will help to give yourself a breather; get rid of the fog in your brain by taking some exercise. Lucky Number Capricorn December 22-January 19 \nThis is a marvellous day for being active and energetic. Even if your idea of being energetic is to open a packet of biscuits, it would do you good today to go for a brisk walk, get your money's worth at the gym, go jogging in the park or knock a football around. Or perhaps you have some indoor games in mind. If you don't find a physical outlet for all your energy, it will start to make you irritable and restless.
