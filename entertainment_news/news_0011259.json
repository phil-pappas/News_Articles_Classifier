The home currently lacks a functioning kitchen and is in need of extensive renovation.\n\"The home is a Highland Park icon that tells the story of Highland Park and how the North Shore got started,\" said Realtor Eve Tarm. \"It was built just six years after the Civil War started, and obviously was very well built.\"\nTarm said the offering price is based solely on the current value of the two-thirds acre of land, three blocks from Lake Michigan, on which the home sits.\nThe historical society has moved its collections to the Highland Park Library, and the 12-room home has been professionally staged by Phoenix Rising to show prospective buyers how a modern family could comfortably live there.\n326 Central Ave. Karen Berkowitz / Pioneer Press Rob Rotering, president of the Highland Park Historical Society, and real estate agent Eve Tarm.

(Karen Berkowitz / Pioneer Press) The home, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is designated a local landmark, features many of the original details, including 15-foot ceilings, wide moldings and quarter-sawn oak flooring. The home was constructed from yellow-clay brick made in Highland Park brickyards.\n\"Even at its time, it was built as a high-end, grand house and you can see that in these gigantic windows,\" said Rob Rotering, president of the Highland Park Historical Society. \"It is just a magnificent house with great bones and so much potential.\"\nAn open house is scheduled from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. Sunday, Oct. 18.\nkberkowitz@pioneerlocal.com @KarenABerkowitz\nCopyright Â© 2015, Chicago Tribune", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561e5244/turbine/historic-listing-interior-1--jpg-20151013", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561e5438/turbine/ct-hpn-historic-listing-tl-1015-20151013"], "published": "2015-10-14T16:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:58:23.134+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
