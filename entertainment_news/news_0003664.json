Photo by Steve Dykes/Getty Images The defense did its job, so why couldn't Utah return specialist Britain Covey do his? Despite dodging peril in games past on a fake punt return and against opposing players, Covey rolled the dice again Saturday night against Arizona State .\nDude must have rolled snake eyes or something, because instead of electing to take a knee and fight another day on a kick return, Covey attempted to throw a lateral across his body to the other side of the end zone.\nRewind the tape a few games back at Oregon, and you could see that Covey has the propensity to take things to a whole other level, faking out the entire team on a punt return while his teammate trotted into the end zone unscathed.\nIt was the ultimate punking, baby, capped by a flatbilled Covey throwing up duck lips on the team plane after his Utes jacked UO at Autzen. But on this occasion against ASU, Covey may have gone a bit too far in the fake-out department. \"Utah... what are you doing?\" tweeted Sports Illustrated.\nLong story short, Covey's teammate couldn't handle a fluttering duck of a pass from Covey, bobbling it as Arizona State players smashed him into the fake red grass like some frat pledge. Naturally, Utah media couldn't wait to get their paws on this kid .\n\"Breaking: Britain Covey turns in (LDS Church) Mission papers on sideline after kick-return blunder. #UtahvsAsu #UtesNation,\" tweeted KSL reporter Alex Kirry in jest.\nIf you could read lips, you could be certain Covey said something skin to oh, and something rhyming with spit as ESPN cameras shined on the dude whose grandfather was a self-help guru.\nNot even Grandpa Stephen could conjure up a day planner good enough to get Covey out of this situation that rhymes with spit, because the first thing that popped into your mind was Kaelin Clay.\nAdmit it, like the guy who dropped the ball at the one yard line prematurely celebrating his touchdown, Covey's flub was right up there with the Long Beach Poly grad's. in the meantime, Covey's mistake cost Utah a 14-13 lead, giving ASU a safety by rule and a 15-14 lead that eventually turned into an 18-14 lead well into the third quarter.\nThe main question: Will Covey's booboo cost Utah the game and potentially a shot at the College Football Playoff? Only time will tell, but one thing is for sure. With running back Devontae Booker going nowhere, Covey's mistake certainly didn't do Utah any favors against a stingy ASU defense.\nBut the fourth quarter proved that Covey's mistake didn't ruin Utah's chances. Booker ran all over Arizona State's defense en route to two touchdowns in which he entered paydirt untouched. Even Covey juked a few ASU dudes out of their Adidas jocks on a bubble screen, all of which helped Utah to take a 34-18 victory and sole possession of first place in the Pac-12 South division.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AlexKirryKSL/status/655604358378229761", "https://twitter.com/SInow/status/655608121369477120"], "published": "2015-10-18T07:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:25:04.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
