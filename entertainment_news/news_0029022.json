Seven things you need to know about the new series Made In Chelsea's back! Seven things you need to know about the new series \nPress Association 2014 / / National Entertainment News Share \nChelsea’s finest sat down to spill the beans about what fans can expect in the next season – and boy, was it juicy! \nThe last episode of the gang in LA gave us some shocking teasers about what would happen when they got home: Tiff cheating on Sam, Jess and Jamie finally getting it on, Binky becoming a hairdresser (sort of). The gang are back from LA (James Stenson/Channel 4) \nSo we put the important questions to Lucy Watson, Jamie Laing, Ollie Locke, Josh “JP” Patterson, Stephanie Pratt and James Dunmore: who’s back, who’s good in bed, who’s been on Grindr (definitely not Ollie). \nHere’s what you need to know about the new series: \n1. Spencer’s back to his old tricks. \nOld Spenny didn’t join the cast in LA for their summer spin-off show and there were rumours he wouldn’t be back for series 10. But Jamie calmed our fears and promised his wingman would be wreaking havoc on King’s Road once again. Made In Chelsea cast (Anthony Devlin/PA) \n“I’m so happy Spenny’s back and he’s back to usual Spencer. He went on this whole tee-total thing and healthy; it’s great for him, but it’s not him. It makes Chelsea a lot quieter. Promoted stories \n“He’s one in a million: I think Spenny and I are going to have a lot of fun together.” \n2. JP’s going to “rectify the wrongs” he did to Binky. \nBunkering down with old friend Ollie in London, Binky revealed she’d fled LA after sleeping with JP and finding out he didn’t feel remotely the same about her. JP was then accused of texting other girls while seeing Binky, and all in all, LA ended up a bit of a mess for the pair. Binky confided her pain in close friend Ollie (Anthony Devlin/PA) \n“This series is a good opportunity to move forward, in whatever direction that may be, but this series gives me chance to rectify the wrongs that I did in LA,” said JP. \n“I didn’t string her along, that’s a lot of people’s interpretation. Binks and I had a really nice trip out in LA and it was unfortunate the way it ended. I handled a situation pretty badly but coming back to London is giving me an opportunity to change that.” \n3. Jamie and Jess have sex – and he rates it just 2/10. \nJamie was joking (we think) but the lothario confirmed that this series will see more shenanigans between the two blonde bombshells – although he fears his strange behaviour will put her off. Jamie seemed happy either way (Vianney Le Caer/Invision/PA) \n“We had a romance in LA and LA didn’t got to my plan. We came back and it’s gone much better in the UK. \n“She’s awesome, and for me, when I fancy someone, it’s easy to play because I fancy a lot of people but when I actually really like someone, I don’t really know how to act so I act really weird. I act really strange and I think people get put off by that.” \n4. The tattoo parlour could be calling for Sam. \nThere was a collective wince when Sam Thompson revealed he’d got girlfriend Tiff Watson’s initials tattooed on his arm, because this is MiC, and on MiC, everyone cheats. Sam claims he has “no regrets” over the TW tattoo (Anthony Devlin/PA) \nThere was a collective eye-roll then when Tiff admitted she’d locked lips with another man – but sister Lucy hinted it might not spell the end for the young lovebirds. \n“I think Sam does make her happy but we’ll just have to wait and see what happens,” she said. \nLuckily James and Jamie had some ideas for what he could turn that indelible TW into. “Twitter?” said Jamie. “Twix?” \n5. Ollie gets a mysterious new love interest. \nAfter two years away from the show, our favourite fake-tanned, long-haired Chelsea jet-setter is back. \n“It feels like I’ve come home, it’s back to where I grew up. Five years ago next month I signed my contract. I’ve taken a bit of a two year break, and I feel like I’m back on form and it’s exciting, I’m happy.” Ollie as we love and remember him when the show began (Dominic Lipinski/PA) \nBut will Ollie be rekindling any old dalliances? \n“I had lots of break ups. None of those people are on the show anymore, there is new loves but we’ll have to wait and see. Well, not loves but new romantic escapades.” \nHe also set the record straight (again) about whether he’d really been on gay app Grindr. \n“I’m absolutely not and never will be and I had to tweet that, but apparently I’ve been chatting up men and I certainly haven’t,” he stressed. \n6. Steph could be about to find herself in a Lady Chatterley situation. \n“Single and desperate” probably isn’t the best way to market yourself, Steph. Steph and ex-boyfriend Josh Shepherd (Ian West/PA) \nThe MiC squad were barely off the tarmac in LA when Josh unceremoniously dumped Steph. Having confirmed that “we don’t speak”, Steph said she has high hopes for the next series. \n“Hopefully I meet someone. I’m single right now. Single and desperate,” she joked. \nPerhaps she could find someone among the “staff” of her new home. Steph’s moving (literally and figuratively) to pastures new: ”I’m living with a lovely, lovely staff at a nice guarded building, with a concierge.” \nLet’s hope there’s no gardener called Mellors… \n7. They’ll be jetting off again. \n“Bosnia, Chechnya, Iraq,” joked JP, although somehow we bet even the MiC insurance budget won’t stretch to that. JP doesn’t look it but he’s quite the joker (Bart Pajak/Channel 4) \nOllie revealed the crew had already been on their short haul trip of the year but kept schtum about the location. \n“We haven’t yet done the long haul one but the short haul one, everyone went and it rained quite a lot but they had a lot of fun.” \nShort-haul and raining. Grimsby, perhaps? Or Blackpool? \nHere’s what else the gang revealed: \nSteph confessed that Lucy was the only one of the MiC cast who knew about her meth addiction. Steph had revealed that she smoked the drug up to 13 times a day in her autobiography Made In Reality but said she wouldn’t be talking about those struggles on the show. Sadly there’ll be much less of this in the new series (Ian West/PA) \nOlly admitted the slightly-boring secret to his bouffant barnet: “It’s just hair spray and a brush.” \nLucy confirmed that Alik Alfus will still be making regular appearances, but he won’t be moving back to the UK to be with Louise Thompson any time soon.
