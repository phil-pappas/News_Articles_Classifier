Again, now for Salman’s big Diwali release Prem Ratan Dhan Payo, Sanjay Bhansali was keen to have the trailer of Bajirao Mastani attached to it but Salman hasn’t agreed.”\nMutual friends say Salman and Bhansali had a fall-out when the filmmaker signed Shah Rukh Khan for Devdas. Says a friend, “Salman never forgave Bhansali for what he saw as a betrayal. Ironically now Salman and Shah Rukh are friends, while Bhansali is left out in the cold.”\n Bollywood Salman Khan Shah Rukh Khan Also Read Shock split: Samantha and Siddharth relationship Lucky to work with Salman: Neil Nitin Mukesh Tube Talk: Sharing screen space with Amitab Bachchan Rakhi steals show at V.K.
