He was 89. \nGuillermin died Sunday at his Topanga Canyon home. Producer and friend Nick Redman confirmed Guillermin's death. Guillermin had been ill for some time, but his death was unexpected, Redman said Wednesday. \nOver the course of his long career, Guillermin directed numerous Hollywood legends, including Peter Sellers, Bette Davis, Paul Newman, Orson Welles and Fred Astaire. \nRedman says Guillermin was underrated, \"a great British character\" and an \"urbane, sophisticated, and cultivated guy.\" His last theatrical feature was \"King Kong Lives\" in 1986. \nHe is survived by a daughter, granddaughter and his wife of 16 years, Mary.
