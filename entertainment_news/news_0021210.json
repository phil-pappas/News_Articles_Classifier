There are thousands of extremely well educated, experienced black male or female unemployed capable publishers that are willing to take the reigns at GlobalGrind with dignity. \nMichael Skolnik writes… I’ve never been pulled over by the cops when I hadn’t done anything wrong. I’ve never been asked for identification for no apparent reason. I’ve never been stopped and frisked. I’ve never been asked to empty my pockets. I’ve never been followed by the police so they could “run my plates.” And certainly I’ve never been shot 6 times. I’ve never had to worry about the police at any point during my 36 years of life. And there’s only one reason for that. The color of my skin. I’m white. ( continue reading Michael Skolnik’s article) \nWhen bringing in my documentation to the Criminal Court Building where the George Zimmerman trial was being heard, I did not find GlobalGrind listed on the accredited press list. \nUnder the critical racial circumstances, I felt that of all publications, GlobalGrind should be in Sanford, Florida covering the George Zimmerman trial. \nWhen days went by and I did not see GlobalGrind on the accredited media list, I picked up the phone and called Michael Skolnik and offered to share our database until he could get registered as qualified press but at least he would have had photos for GlobalGrind articles. \nNot being recognized as press, GlobalGrind would not have been given access to daily trial photos. We were offering him a professional courtesy which he readily accepted. \nDays would pass but we still didn’t see GlobalGrind on the media list. \nOne day when least expected, in the tall windowed hallway that runs alongside the court room where the trial was being heard, I caught a glimpse of Michael Skolnik whispering into his cell phone. \nI was standing next to a SyndicatedNews.NET associate and a well known black community leader. We were all sipping bad coffee out of paper cups. \nWe naturally assumed Skolnik was coming over to say hello or perhaps thank us for helping him. At the very least to just greet us, shake our hands, the usual. Not at all. \nSkolnik tucked his head low into his shoulders as he hid behind taller people trying to avoid our attention. Then thinking we hadn’t seen him, he scurried down the hall like a frightened school boy that hadn’t turned in his homework. \nSkolnik does not know that two things happened that day as a result of that cowardly display. \nRemember, that several of us were finishing our coffee in the hallway. But word had come that we had to take our seats as the judge was re-entering the court room. \nWithin a few minutes, a friend of mine, on duty that day as a guard came to the newsroom and asked me to see him in the hallway. I followed him out to the midway hall where we had to whisper. \nHe asked me to identify someone from a picture just taken inside the court room. \nIt was a picture of Michael Skolnik sitting next to Trayvon Martin’s mother, Sybrina Fulton. The two of them were sitting in the court room and Michael was not wearing any press ID of any kind. Instead he was wearing a FAMILY tag. “Do you know this guy?” I was asked. \n“That’s Michael Skolnik, he’s Russell Simmons’ Editor-in-chief at GlobalGrind. It’s very good that he’s here,” I responded. \nHe asked me whether he was a relative, I didn’t answer right away. “Is he a relative of the family?” he asked again. \nI said “No, he is not related to Trayvon Martin but if he’s in there it has to be because she wants him there.” \nSo not only had Skolnik not identified himself appropriately as a media member to the Security Team but he further posed as a Trayvon Martin relative. \nHow did Skolnik expect to be taken seriously as a journalist by anyone when he was sitting with the victim’s mother on the “family side” of the court room wearing a label stating that he was a member of the FAMILY? He was basically saying that his mind was made up. \nThat act in itself displayed he was not there as a legitimate media member but that he was overcompensating because he knows he is generally out of place in the black circles he forces himself into every day. \nThat move did not look good in the eyes of the black community leaders that were standing with me watching the event unfold. \nI was embarrassed for him when the Community Leader standing next to me, tugged my sleeve asking, “Why is Skolnik skulking around like that to the point where security is asking you if you know who he is. Did he lie to get in here?” then everyone standing there laughed out loud as they watched Skolnik trying to move quickly and awkwardly away from us which brought more negative attention to him still. \nSkolnik tends to use his white male privilege to access situations where he’s not invited then name drops his millionaire boss’s name as he elbows his way in the door. \nThe display in the hallway that day lacked integrity. \n[Above] Attorney Benjamen Crump representing the Trayvon Martin family during George Zimmerman’s murder trial interviewed by Michelle Bostick, one of the owners of SyndicatedNews.NET \nBeing in a black environment and having black friends does not qualify a white person to stand in a position where they know they do not belong and a black person is better suited. \nWe at SyndicatedNews.NET realized that this trial was different because this was a case of an adult white man shooting an unarmed, under-aged black kid. My files for that case remain unchanged. When I heard Trayvon’s age, I labeled his files “CHILD” and that’s how they remain. \nWe thought it more appropriate to ask one of our owners, Michelle Bostick to join me and cover the trial with me so that we could do the story justice. She is a business owner from the black community and she is a mother. \nWe wanted to be guided by someone that lives the black experience and who was also a mother. It gave us a very tender black perspective that we wouldn’t have had otherwise. If blacks do not like being poorly represented by whites then they have to step up and say so and object loudly when it happens. The black community cannot remain quiet and docile when they see an injustice such as a white person assuming a role better suited for a black person, say nothing – then complain about the outcome. \nIt is ridiculous for the NAACP to have rid themselves of Rachel Dolezal who built a significant body of work for the black community over the years but keep Skolnik in a job where he shows up for parties, has his picture taken with celebrities and politicians, then goes on television interviews speaking about racism and the black experience. \nAren’t there enough black people available to speak for the black community? Is the black community so lacking in representatives that they need a white person to speak for them? I think not. \nIn this day and age, to have a white man speak for blacks is no different than when Harry Truman’s administration insisted on holding Native American Tribal money. The administration’s white racist policies had always controlled Native Americans and they wanted to continue doing so by controlling their money. \nA white person cannot live the black experience nor can he or she speak from the black perspective. Since when can’t blacks speak for themselves? GlobalGrind cannot continue justifying having a white man represent black issues. \nThe black community cannot continue to object to racism when they see it and allow it to continue because they don’t want to be rude or politically incorrect. \nWe are no longer living in the fifties where white people were acceptable filling the role of spokesmen for black people. If blacks don’t object – they’re just being polite. Blacks resent having a white person express their experiences for them as though they can’t speak for themselves. \nI was ashamed for Skolnik that he didn’t have sufficient character to walk over to us to at the very least greet us like a civilized grown up. \nAnd identifying himself as a journalist, then sitting with Sybrina Fulton and wearing a FAMILY tag may have given him “great hood cred” among the black people he knows but it certainly did not make him look like a professional unbiased journalist. \nHe lost all credibility in that Sanford, Florida court house that day. \n\nBlack men and women can speak for themselves \nEvery now and again, I am often asked why I don’t let it go when a white person assumes a role that doesn’t belong to him or her. I’ve pitched a bloody fit whenever I’ve seen it however benevolent it is made to appear or disguised. \nAnd if the individual is hiding behind someone’s big pocket, it’s even easier for racist behavior that is totally inappropriate to go on almost unnoticed. However, what was acceptable in the fifties is not acceptable today. And as a Hispanic professional I will protest whenever I see a racial injustice however slight or however well rehearsed. \nThe National Center for Education Statistics shows that blacks have increased their graduation levels overall from 82 to 92 percent. With the black community having a clear educational success rate overall, it is demeaning that a white man in 2015, still feels he has to impose himself within the black community to serve as their spokesman. Call it what you want to call it but it stems from pure misguided racism at its core. \nBefore a man or a woman dives headfirst into an ethnic group other than his or her own, he or she must first fully explore their own ethnic background, its associated culture and all the nuances about their own origins to fully understand who they are. \nTo dismiss everything about oneself and to step guardedly into another culture but only as close as one has to, like stepping into a muddy pool, in order to keep a superior position is not an acceptable practice in this day and age. \nAnd when whites speak for minorities, it is a ‘habit’ that they were born into. They are only doing what they’ve been subliminally taught. They don’t mean it and often don’t even realize what they’re doing – it is pure racism none the less. \nBut when minorities allow it, we have no one to blame but ourselves. \nRuthie DiTucci", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T22:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:46:21.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
