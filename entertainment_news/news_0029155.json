Image 11 of 11 The Del restaurant is now open in Memorial area 1 / 11 Back to Gallery The Del , a new \"fine casual\" restaurant concept from the owners of Glass Wall and the Brooklyn Athletic Club , is now open at 6565 Del Monte off Voss.\nStudewood Hospitality Group has quietly opened the restaurant, tucked behind Roegels Barbecue Co. and near the new Bramble restaurant from Randy Rucker. The restaurant has hired Albert Vasquez as its executive chef. Vasquez recently served as culinary director for Dish Society ; he also trained under Scott Tycer at Aires and Gravitas.\nThe menu offers starters and small plates that include gnocchi tots (potato gnocchi with a cheese and ale fondue topped with fried onions); barbecue shrimp; lamb chops with raw almond curry; and yellowfin tuna tartar served with crispy wontons and a sweet chili sauce. Starters range from $6 to $18. Soups, salads, burgers and sandwiches are offered (interesting options are the fattoush salad and a fried green tomatoes and bacon club sandwich).\nMain dishes include braised short rib bolognese; ale-steam mussels and frites; seared snapper in a red pepper shrimp both and corn succotash; roasted fennel curry chicken; bratwurst with house-made sauerkraut and mashed potatoes; ribeye steak with a sweet chili glaze served with risotto; and steak frites. Entrees are priced between $15 and $35.\nThe Del's opening hours are Sunday through Thursday from 5 to 10 p.m. and Friday and Saturday from 5 to 11. The restaurant will add lunch in late October.\nThe Del opens without one of its guiding hands, restaurateur Shepard Ross, who, as CultureMap recently reported, has left Studewood Hospitality Group to focus on the highly praised Pax Americana restaurant.", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/10/8725018/3/920x920.jpg", "http://treadsack.com/hunkydory/", "http://paxamericanahtx.com/", "http://www.roegelsbarbecue.com/", "http://thebrooklynathleticclub.com/", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/10/8725021/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/06/46/8677798/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/10/8725020/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/10/8725022/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/10/8725021/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/10/8725020/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/04/8724739/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/10/8725022/3/920x920.jpg", "http://dishsociety.com/", "http://www.stateofgracetx.com/", "http://thedelhtx.com/", "http://www.glasswalltherestaurant.com/GW_Site/home.html", "https://www.krispykreme.com/", "http://restaurantbramble.com/", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/16/22/8709295/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/10/8725018/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://www.corkscrewbbq.com/", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/33/75/13/7328453/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/15/43/8706254/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/06/46/8677798/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/33/75/13/7328453/4/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/15/43/8706254/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/10/8725019/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/04/8724739/4/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/10/8725019/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/16/22/8709295/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T03:46:34.274+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
