In an interview with The Associated Press for her upcoming film \" Our Brand Is Crisis \" on Wednesday, October 21, the Oscar-winning actress said that there's only one adopted child in her household. A reporter said to Bullock, \"I want to congratulate you. You adopted a new girl.\" The actress looked bewildered and explained, \"There is only one adopted child in my household and his name is Louis.\" Bullock then told the reporter that she would let everyone know if she had a new adopted child. \"If I had a second adopted child, everyone would be hearing about it. I would be loud and clear and say, 'Yes, I have officially adopted a second child.' Right now, Louis must be it.\" The \" Gravity \" actress really loved her 5-year-old son Louis so that she wanted to film in a place that would be beneficial for her son. \"I said you've got three locations you can pick from, not including Puerto Rico and Bolivia, where I feel happy to have Louis in school and it was Austin, Los Angeles or New Orleans,\" she revealed. \"New Orleans was number one and that's where we went. He was very happy.\" Earlier this year, Bullock also denied similar rumors. In People's \"World's Most Beautiful\" issue, she said, \"I've always said that I could have a house full of kids. But at this time the only kids in my house, other than Louis, are the ones whose parents want them back at the end of the playdate,\" she explained. \"But if these drumbeaters know something that I don't, I'd appreciate a heads-up on the details so I can pick up some supplies. I'm wickedly unprepared if Louis is getting a sibling this week.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T11:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:54:49.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
