Story highlights The original novel is marking its 10th anniversary Author Stephenie Meyer said she wanted to do something special for the re-release (CNN) The author of \"Twilight\" has a unique way to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the hit vampire romance novel. Stephenie Meyer has reimagined the blockbuster novel with gender-swapped characters. She told \"Good Morning America\" on Tuesday that in the new 442-page \"Life and Death: Twilight Reimagined,\" original hero Edward Cullen is now Edythe, and heroine Bella Swan is a boy named Beaufort (Beau for short). The book was released Tuesday. \"I wanted to do something fun for the 10th anniversary, and the publisher wanted like a foreword, and I thought, 'Well, maybe something more interesting,' \" she said. The wildly successful franchise resulted in more than 150 million books sold and a series of successful films starring Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart. Initially, the book starts out the same, Meyer said, but there are some changes as the reader delves further into the new book because the characters' personalities are slightly different. But at the heart is still the story that made the books and movies the subject of obsessive fandom. i haven't mentioned the new twilight book because 13 year old me is embarrassingly excited to read it & i gotta keep up my act of being cool", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T19:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T19:58:47.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
