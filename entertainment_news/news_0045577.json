Reuters/Lucas Jackson \nLOS ANGELES A Los Angeles judge ruled on Wednesday that Bill Cosby's upcoming deposition in a lawsuit brought by a woman accusing the veteran comedian of sexually abusing her will be sealed at least until December, said an attorney for the accuser. \nLos Angeles Superior Court Judge Craig Karlan said he would determine at a December hearing which parts of the deposition could be made public after reviewing the transcript, according to attorney Gloria Allred, who represents accuser Judy Huth. \nThe civil lawsuit, filed last year, alleges that Cosby sexually assaulted Huth when she was aged 15 in 1974 at Hugh Hefner's Los Angeles Playboy Mansion. \nKarlan's decision came after Cosby, 78, requested a protective order to keep his Oct. 9 deposition confidential, a move that Allred opposed, telling reporters last week, \"There should be transparency.\" \nRepresentatives for Cosby declined to comment on Wednesday. \nPreviously, the comedian's attorney Martin Singer had called Huth's allegations false and \"defamatory.‚Äù \nThis will mark the first time Cosby has been directed to testify under oath in response to sexual misconduct complaints since a deposition he gave in a Pennsylvania case he settled out of court nine years ago. \nIn the past year, more than 50 women have come forward with allegations against Cosby including drugging, sexual harassment, sexual assault and rape, but as most incidents date back decades, it puts them outside the statute of limitations for legal action. \nHuth's case, however, cites repressed psychological injuries that she claims were only discovered in the last three years, allowing legal action under the statute of limitations, according to Allred. \nAccording to Allred, Judge Karlan on Wednesday denied Cosby's request to dismiss the case and fine her client $45,000 in sanctions. \nCosby also faces a second civil lawsuit bringing sexual assault claims against him. \nOn Tuesday, a 25-year-old woman who said Cosby sexually assaulted her at the Playboy Mansion in 2008 when she was a minor filed a lawsuit seeking a jury trial and at least $75,000 in damages. \n(Editing by Piya Sinha-Roy and Steve Orlofsky) \nOur top photos from the past 24 hours.
