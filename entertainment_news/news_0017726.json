Each of the local recipients – a trio of organizations comprising HELP of Southern Nevada, University of Nevada School of Medicine and Injured Police Officers Fund – was presented with $35,000, adding to a total contribution of $380,000 from the promoter over the years to various local charities and programs. \nAlthough Insomniac hasn't released exact figures yet with regard to the financial impact the annual three-day event had on the local economy this past year, since leaving Los Angeles for Las Vegas nearly five years ago, the promoter claims to account for $19.9 million being raised in taxes last year. EDC Las Vegas, which has been held every summer at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway since moving, is the promoter’s flagship event, paving the way for expansion into other cities across the globe such as Mexico, Brazil and Japan. \nWhile there’s no word yet on which artists will be performing at EDC 2016 next summer, three-day general admission tickets for the festival, slated for Friday, June 17 through Sunday, June 19, are available for purchase now at lasvegas.electricdaisycarnival.com/tickets/ for $355 (plus fees and taxes), or fans can buy VIP tickets for $699 (plus fees and taxes).
