FRANK BELLINO, FILE PHOTO , FRANK BELLINO, FILE PHOTO Related article » REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS\nBefore the state abolished them in 2011, Inland redevelopment agencies spent millions of dollars on big community projects. Here are a few examples.\nOld Town Temecula: Temecula's redevelopment agency spent tens of millions of dollars on new infrastructure, affordably priced apartments and a theater. Today, Old Town is a bustling downtown district with shops and restaurants and hosts community events, including the Rod Run classic car shows.\nRiverside Renaissance: Redevelopment bonds helped fuel more than $1 billion of public works improvements around the city of Riverside. More than 400 projects, including roads, sewer lines, parks and libraries, were part of the five-year Riverside Renaissance program.\nOther Riverside projects: The city's redevelopment agency had a hand in the Arlington library, RCC Joint Use Aquatics Center, Fox Performing Arts Center, La Sierra Community Center and the Hyatt Place hotel, among other projects.\nCounty projects: Riverside County's redevelopment agency paid for a wide range of projects, from replacement housing for residents of the dilapidated Duroville mobile home park near the Salton Sea to an aquatic center near Perris.\nREDEVELOPMENT: WHAT IT DID Redevelopment froze the assessed values of properties in designated redevelopment zones. Redevelopment agencies then received the future growth in property taxes, known as the tax increment, that would have otherwise gone to local governments or school districts.\nAt one point, there were 53 Inland redevelopment agencies that received about 30 percent of all property-tax revenue; the statewide average was 12 percent. Unlike other agencies in California, Inland redevelopment focused mainly on vacant land instead of developed areas.\nPrivate property could be seized through eminent domain for redevelopment projects, provided the owners were compensated.\nWHAT AB2 DOES AB2 seeks to accomplish redevelopment's goals in a more regulated way.\nLike redevelopment zones, the authorities will rely on property tax growth to pay for projects. However, the areas the authorities serve must meet certain criteria – higher-than-average crime rates, for example – and there must be community representation on the authorities' boards of directors.\nA local government forming an authority must get permission from other public agencies before spending those agencies' share of future property-tax revenue on improvements.\nIf they don't like what's happening, residents in a community served by an authority can take steps to shut the authority down. And property tax dollars ticketed for schools can't be touched.\nWHAT EIF DISTRICTS DO Another tool similar to redevelopment is a 2014 bill that lays the groundwork for enhanced infrastructure financing districts.\nAs with redevelopment, cities and counties can create the districts, which have eminent domain powers and can use property-tax revenue to pay for improvements. Cities and counties can create multiple districts.\nIf a district has 12 or more registered voters, then 55 percent of those voters must approve any plan to issue bonds to finance district projects, and like AB2, school funding is off-limits. Districts are governed by boards that must include members of the public who live within the district's boundaries.\nCompared to AB2, the districts are meant for more broad-reaching, less-localized infrastructure projects.\nAs Halloween approaches, redevelopment, or at least something like it, is coming back from the dead.\nFour years after Sacramento lawmakers abolished California’s redevelopment agencies, Gov. Jerry Brown last month signed into law a bill giving cities and counties a tool to build affordable housing, improve infrastructure and revive blighted areas.\nThe bill, AB2, comes about a year after another law was adopted that allows local governments to create special financing districts to do what redevelopment once did.\nBoth new laws provide more oversight but not as much money as redevelopment, said Dan Carrigg, legislative director for the League of California Cities, which advocates for cities’ interests in Sacramento.\n“These measures, while helpful, should not be oversold,” he said. “They have much less financial lift than (redevelopment). So if they are used, they will be used more surgically, and it may take a decade or so until revenue streams yield enough to do much.”\nRedevelopment emerged after World War II as a way for government agencies to combat blight, and more than 400 locally controlled agencies formed statewide.\nCities and county officials hailed redevelopment as a vital economic development tool. But critics said redevelopment favored politically connected developers and steered money away from schools and other public services.\nOpponents also questioned the appropriateness of some redevelopment projects. A 2011 state audit criticized Palm Desert’s use of redevelopment money to remodel a high-end golf course. Many redevelopment agencies lacked accountability and transparency, said an audit by then-state Controller John Chiang.\nSeeking to close a $25 billion-plus budget gap, the governor and state Legislature killed redevelopment in 2011. The move survived a court challenge, and cities and counties, including Riverside County, started the complex task of resolving their redevelopment agencies’ unpaid debts and unfinished projects.\n‘CORPORATE WELFARE’\nAB2 allows cities and counties to set up “community revitalization and investment authorities” similar to redevelopment agencies. But a property rights advocacy group says AB2 shares many of redevelopment’s problems.\n“Community Revitalization Investment Authorities introduce the worst form of corporate welfare,” Marko Mlikotin, executive director of the California Alliance to Protect Private Property Rights, said in a news release.\n“As in the past, the combination of eminent domain and the potential for profit will only lead to abuse, wasteful spending and public corruption.”\nRiverside County Supervisor John Tavaglione believes AB2 could help.\n“AB2 enhances the opportunity of distressed communities to overcome poverty and provide a path to a level playing field with other communities, a form of economic and environmental justice,” he wrote in an email.\n“Additionally, AB2 fills a void by offering a tool that can be used in the state’s rural, disadvantaged poorer areas and neighborhoods, which was the original focus of redevelopment.”\nTemecula Community Development Director Luke Watson said his office is researching AB2’s fine print. “It just came out, so we’re still working through it,” he said. “But it looks like at this time the city of Temecula won’t necessarily derive any of the major benefits.”\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw1ffj-b88522744z.120151010210423000g9fcamld.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw1ffj-b88522744z.120151010210423000g9fcaml5.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw1ffk-b88522744z.120151010210423000g51ce3b3.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/nw1ffj-b88522744z.120151010210423000g9fcamla.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw1ffk-b88522744z.120151010210423000g51ce3bn.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw1ffl-b88522744z.120151010210423000g51ce3bs.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw1ffj-b88522744z.120151010210423000g9fcamld.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw1ffk-b88522744z.120151010210423000g51ce3bn.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw1ffk-b88522744z.120151010210423000g51ce3b3.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw1ffj-b88522744z.120151010210423000g9fcamla.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw1ffj-b88522744z.120151010210423000g9fcaml5.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw1ffl-b88522744z.120151010210423000g51ce3bs.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:25:41.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
