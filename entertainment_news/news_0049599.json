The revolutionary race car smashed straight-line speed records a few months later and ignited a passion for speed. \nThe National Packard Museum will capture this passion for speed with “Start Your Engines,” an all-new exhibit celebrating local racing history that opens Saturday and runs through Dec. 27. \n“Start Your Engines!” is the first in a series of annual exhibits that will be devoted to local auto-racing history. It will feature Sharon Speedway, the area’s longest continuously running track. Six vintage race vehicles, including a midget, coupe and Lou Blaney’s sprint car, will be featured along with rare photographs and memorabilia that tell the story of the track that opened in 1931. \nIn conjunction with “Start Your Engines!,” the museum will present its “Coffee and Donuts” Saturday morning lecture series, each free with paid admission to the museum. For dates, topics and information, go to packardmuseum.org or call 330-394-1899. \nThe museum is open Tuesday through Saturday from noon to 5 p.m. and Sunday from 1 to 5 p.m. Other stories of interest", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:36:19.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
