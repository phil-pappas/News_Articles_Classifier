Gupte died at a young age of 23 in Operation Jura Bridge on October 11, 1965 during the Indo-Pak war. \nPraising the people of Maharashtra for their contribution to the nation, Parrikar said, “The people who draw inspiration from the legendary Shivaji Maharaj can never be behind (in serving the country) and this is why a large number of armymen and officers hail from Kolhapur, Satara, Karad, etc. (in the state).” \nOn a personal note, Parrikar said even after entering politics he never thought that he, “a peace-loving person by nature”, would become the defence minister, but “like everyone, I too had no control over my destiny.”\"Every Goan is a peace-loving person. If a Goan indulges in skirmish, then there is a strong possibility that he may not be originally from Goa. But I am a true Goan and peace-loving person by nature. But my fate has brought me here as Defence Minister, which I am trying my best to deliver,’ he said. \n  4:09 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T13:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:00:55.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
