Frankly, I feel uncomfortable when religion is brought up. All my friends are firm believers of Christianity and attend Bible study, or help out at their church. My parents and brothers don’t believe in God. When I say I’d like to be a Christian, my brothers make fun of me. I want to be a Christian because it would be nice to feel like I belong, and most Christians aren’t accepting of atheists — especially other girls my age. They might be polite, but they’re distant. It also doesn’t help that the boy I like comes from a religious family. \nOutsider in Alabama \nDear Outsider: I think you should continue being true to the person you really are. If you’re feeling isolated now, consider what a fraud you will feel like if you join a religion and must pray to a deity you don’t believe in in order to “fit in.” While many churches promote church-related youth activities, you should explore what nonsectarian activities are available in your community. If the boy you like cares about you, he will like you even if you aren’t religious, and you will have your self-respect. It’s not easy feeling different, but sometimes it’s worth it.\nDear Abby: We have a nosy neighbor I’ll call “Myrtle.” She’s nice to talk to, but I suspect she must be watching us with binoculars because she told me what brand of wine we drink. When my husband sends me flowers, she calls me to find out why. If we have a party, she calls to find out what it’s about! A few years ago, I mentioned to her that I usually walk my dog in the morning. She responded, “Oh, I know when you walk your dog.” (Is that creepy or is it me?) Abby, we have nothing to hide, but our life is none of her business. I’ve been neighborly to her, but it seems like she wants too much information about us and has no problem telling us all her business. She’s single and friendly with all the neighbors, as are we. \nFed Up in Utah \nDear Fed Up: Continue to be polite to your neighbor, but when she asks questions you would rather not answer, instead of answering her directly, respond with another question: “Myrtle, why do you ask?” If she presses for an answer, without being confrontational say, “It’s personal,” and change the subject. Be sure to keep your shades drawn on windows that face her house, and when you walk your dog, take a different route.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:11:52.263+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
