Lindsay may not be part of the main couple of the show, but, in her character's own words, she's Beyoncé, not Kelly Rowland. In honor of You're the Worst 's stellar second season, with new episodes Wednesdays at 10:30 P.M. on FXX, Cosmopolitan.com chatted with Donohue about Tinder, stealing dresses from set, and why she doesn't want to talk negatively about her own figure.\n In the last episode, we learned that Lindsay's dating profile said she was looking for guys with a lot of money and/or giant hogs. Your reaction to that?\n[ Laughs ] She has really high standards.\nHow would you personally critique her Tinder profile?\nI would probably say that she should look a little more at internal qualities of men, perhaps. Although the external qualities are, you know, important, I think maybe she should be a little less superficial.\nMore From Cosmopolitan Have you ever helped a friend set up their Tinder profile?\nNo. However, a bunch of my friends convinced me to go on Tinder a year ago. And I found the idea of having a profile so awkward that I just put my pictures up with no writing. Because any time I went to write something about myself like, \"Hi, this is my age and this is what I'm looking for.\" I just felt way too corny. Tinder is ridiculous. I got kinda tired of the whole thing after two days.\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail Getty What's the main kind of Tinder guy you saw in L.A.?\nWell, actually, this was when I was in New York. And I thought I got lucky. The first guy I went on a date with, I'm not gonna say who it was, but he was this saxophone player in a famous band. So I'm like, \"Oh, Tinder is really working out well for me. I'm getting really lucky here.\" And then I met him and it turned out to not be so great. He was kind of weird.\nI'm kinda tired of trying to step inside guys' heads. It's a little exhausting.\nShare Tweet Also, the thing that bothers me is, as a single woman, you kind of want to be courted and you want the guy to ask you out on a proper date. And on Tinder, the guy has it mapped out for him. And what I found was common on Tinder, which I don't understand, [is] even after you match and you're messaging, it seems like pulling teeth to actually [get the guys to] ask you out. It's like, \"Are we just gonna chat for five days?\" I was messaging with this one guy for like a week . And he knew everything about me! He knew the time I was born. He knew my mom had a cesarean. At the end of the week I was just so confused. I'm like, \"Does this man just love messaging me and never wants to meet me?\" I'm kinda tired of trying to step inside guys' heads. It's a little exhausting.\nOne thing I thought was funny about Lindsay's profile was that she had this hot lingerie on, but then she had wing sauce on her face. What do you think that says about her as a character?\nI think it's great. What I love about playing Lindsay is that she kind of has this childhood innocence about her where she doesn't seem to have basic, normal, human manners. She's not malicious about it. You know what I mean? She's not trying to hurt anybody. She's just a little oblivious sometimes. So she probably just went home and kept eating the wing sauce. And then she was like, \"Oh shit, I've gotta multitask here. Gotta put on the lingerie, cause Edgar's coming over.\" And then she probably just forgot she had wing sauce.\nIn the pilot and in the opening credits, we see Lindsay in more conservative clothes, but now she has wears more revealing, flattering dresses. Are you happier with your new wardrobe?\nI know, in the opening credits she's such a good girl. I feel like the raunchy Lindsay was always living inside of her, just waiting to be unleashed. But, yeah, I love, love, love the wardrobe department on our show and we just have a really great time together in fittings. I loved the white dress from episode 6 of season 1 so much that I stole it from the wardrobe department. And then this season I stole another dress that I just wear everywhere now.\nGIF Share Tweet Pin E-mail FXX What is it that you like about it?\nI'm short and I'm curvy and so shopping is hard for me sometimes. So what I love about the dress is that it just fits my body well. You know, my boobs are a little bigger on top and my waist goes in, so it hugs my waist and then it kind of flairs out around the leg area. It just accentuates the good and hides the bad.\nLindsay seems very sex positive and she seems to be very comfortable with her sexuality, so why do you think that she's still kind of into Paul, who is clearly not good at sex?\nIt's a mixture of ego and also authentically missing him. It's very natural that when you feel rejected by someone, you are really bruised and hurt and you want to get them back. And then even though they're marriage wasn't great, he was still a very important person in her life. I believe perhaps she genuinely misses him and is regretting being a bad wife. And what I love is that You're the Worst explores these complexities in a very honest way, because we are not black and white.\nWe're taught as a society what is acceptable for a women to look like and what's not. And where fat should be and shouldn't.\nShare Tweet As a feminist, just to speak to what women go through, I think women are put in a box way too often. What I love about You're the Worst is that no female character is portrayed as a black-and-white cartoon character. We're all complicated, messy human beings. And a part of me even regrets talking about that dress in that way. Because why are we always trying to hide things about our bodies? You know what I mean? I'm guilty of it too. I think women are very guilty of buying into that. Sometimes I catch myself if I'm shopping and I'm like, \"I want to hide my thighs and my arms.\" And then I kind of take a minute where I'm like, \"No, that's not really being kind to yourself. Maybe learn to embrace things that we're taught as women not to like.\" We're taught as a society what is acceptable for a women to look like and what's not. And where fat should be and shouldn't. And I think it's important to sometimes reprogram ourselves and recondition ourselves to not have so much negativity towards our own bodies.\nDefinitely. In the first season, Lindsay was dieting and kind of self-conscious about herself, but this season the very exciting thing is how she's so free and having fun.\nExactly. And I think it's cool to see women on television eating. Women eat. We eat things other than salads.\n​Follow Sarah on Twitter . ​\n​This interview has been edited and condensed.", "external_links": ["http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1443650453-coke-worst-linds.gif", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/480x270/placeholder_gallery-1443650453-coke-worst-linds.gif", "https://twitter.com/sarahccaldwell", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/768x432/gallery-1443650453-coke-worst-linds.gif", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/640x360/placeholder_gallery-1443650453-coke-worst-linds.gif", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/640x320/landscape-1443648976-youre-the-worst-kether-donohue-article-story-large.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/480x270/gallery-1443650453-coke-worst-linds.gif", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1280x1922/gallery-1443649575-gettyimages-475465510.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/980x1472/gallery-1443649575-gettyimages-475465510.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/768x432/placeholder_gallery-1443650453-coke-worst-linds.gif", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1600x2403/gallery-1443649575-gettyimages-475465510.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/768x1153/gallery-1443649575-gettyimages-475465510.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/placeholder_1443650453-coke-worst-linds.gif", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/480x721/gallery-1443649575-gettyimages-475465510.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1600x800/landscape-1443649575-gettyimages-475465510.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/640x360/gallery-1443650453-coke-worst-linds.gif", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/640x961/gallery-1443649575-gettyimages-475465510.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/640x320/landscape-1443650453-coke-worst-linds.gif"], "published": "2015-10-01T01:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:55:51.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
