They often fail a simple heel-to-toe test and tend to fall over.\" Â© Getty Images / Martin Barraud/OJO Images The advice was to avoid using laptops or phones while sitting or lying in bed and raising devices to eye level.Dr. Carter's views on the rise of the condition were supported by Sammy Margo, from the UK's Chartered Society of Physiotherapy.However, she noted that \"text neck\" could come about due to a lack of physical activity as well.Consultant spinal physiotherapist Dr. Chris McCarthy agreed: \"Non-specific neck pain can be related to sedentary postures.\"As physios, we would support a notion that if a child does not do any exercise and stays in a static position playing computer games and on Facebook, there is more chance they will get spinal pain, including in the neck.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T22:02:01.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
