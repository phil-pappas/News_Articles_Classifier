The 54-year-old singer-songwriter unveils the lyric video of the album's lead single \"Echoes in Rain\". Enya says in a statement about her upcoming album, \"This album has a theme of journeys. Journeys to the island; through the length of a lifetime; through history, through emotions; and journeys across great oceans. So although it's not a 'themed' album, as such, we nevertheless have an underlying connection between songs.\" Enya is working with producer and sound engineer Nicky Ryan and lyricist Roma Ryan. The album was inspired by Roma's work on a series of poetry books themed around islands. \"Echoes in Rain\" was the final track to be completed for the album and chosen as the lead single. Back in 1988, Enya's hit single \"Orinoco Flow\" was also the last song to be recorded for her \" Watermark \" album. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:00:52.886+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
