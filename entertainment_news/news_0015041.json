Other actors include Michael Shannon and Adam Scott, he said. \nThe movie takes a thread from \"It's a Wonderful Life.\" A George Bailey-like guy in a struggling, small town has too much to drink and runs through town in a gorilla suit. Video of his streaking goes viral, and the world descends on the little town, Johnson said. \n\"It's a big fun comedy,\" Johnson said. \"Good-natured.\" \nNo, Baldwin does not play the guy in the gorilla suit, Johnson said. Instead, Baldwin plays the cranky mayor of the town. \nJohnson said the film producers are looking at Seneca Falls. \"It could be,\" he said of the village that was the inspiration for Bedford Falls in \"It's a Wonderful Life.\" \n\"But there's a lot of good options,\" he said. \nThe Film House is also planning to begin filming \"The Divorce Party\" in early February. That film will be shot mostly inside the CNY Film Hub in DeWitt. It stars Luke Ryan of \"American Sniper,\" and Abbie Cornish from \"Limitless\" and Alexandra Daddario. \nThe Film House recently filmed \"American Dresser\" starring Tom Berenger in the Syracuse area. Both the Film House and Perlman's outfit are relocating to DeWitt to take advantage of lucrative film and production tax credits offered by New York state. \nNew York built a $15 million film studio in DeWitt with taxpayer money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T01:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:08:29.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
