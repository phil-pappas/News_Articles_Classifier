But the clever re-harmonizations of the arrangement, the silken quality of Alpert's lines and the pulsing beat of the band kept this very old train running just this side of nostalgia. \nIn essence, the pleasure in hearing the vintage material was in discovering what Alpert would do with it. \"Besame Mucho,\" for instance, always will sound most persuasive as a ballad, the ardor and poetry of the melody best savored slowly, as in the kisses the song describes. But Alpert, a tinkerer since the beginning of his career, opened with flourishes, dancing around the tune before getting to it. The tempo may have been a bit brisk for the occasion, but the radiance of Alpert's sound and the sculpted quality of his lines briefly made you nearly forget the natural tempo for this nocturne. \nOf course Alpert offered listeners a medley of requisite hits, but he showed no haste in working his way through them. There was plenty of sustained tension in \"Rise,\" a golden tone in \"The Lonely Bull\" (with funk-tinged accompaniment) and the inexorable rhythmic drive of old in \"A Taste of Honey.\" \nSinger Hall contributed significantly to the occasion, her tenure with Sergio Mendes' Brasil '66 echoing in her first-rate work in Brazilian repertoire. The airy quality of Hall's voice, plus her signature vibrato, exquisitely suited music of Antonio Carlos Jobim and past hits such as Burt Bacharach's \"The Look of Love,\" delivered by Hall with unforced suavity. \n\"Come Fly With Me,\" the title track of Alpert's new album, came toward the end, and here you could zero in on the subtlety of the trumpeter's phrasing and the distinct character of his articulation. Jazz musicians by nature strive for a singular voice, and Alpert's remains as recognizable and welcome as ever. \nHoward Reich is a Tribune critic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:48:35.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
