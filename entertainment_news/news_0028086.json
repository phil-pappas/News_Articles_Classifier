The company’s website shows that it raised the monthly price for its Standard streaming service to $9.99 for new subscribers in the U.S., Canada, and some Latin American countries.\nThe move comes about a year and a half after a similar hike that increased the fee from $7.99 to $8.99. New subscribers will have to start paying $9.99 out of the gate.\nNetflix said that current pricing for existing subscribers on the “standard” plan will remain in place for 12 months, unless they’re already covered by a price guarantee with a longer term. When it bumped up pricing last year, Netflix introduced a single-stream, non-HD plan (the “basic” plan) for $7.99 monthly; that pricing will not change. In addition, the company’s “premium” plan — offering up to four simultaneous streams and access to 4K Ultra HD titles — will remain unchanged at $11.99 per month. per Variety .\nNetflix implemented the price increase “[to] continue adding more TV shows and movies including many Netflix original titles,” a Netflix spokesman said in an emailed statement. Netflix shares rose about 1.8 percent in late-afternoon trading to $110.09. The streaming service rolled out a similar increase across its European territories in August, increasing the cost of its standard plan by about a euro.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T22:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:25:08.733+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
