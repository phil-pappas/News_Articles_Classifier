We focus our energy on enabling seniors to live their lives to the fullest â€“ and in doing so changing the myths and perceptions of senior living. As the largest senior living provider in the country, we have the opportunity and I believe the responsibility to lead this conversation.\"\nBrookdale is bringing visibility to its mission of \"enriching lives every day\" through an extensive national television and multi-channel branding and marketing campaign, including digital, direct mail, print, social media, and local community outreach. The campaign showcases real Brookdale associates whose unscripted stories help to counter some long held stigmas about senior living. It is also backed by a number of operational and innovation platforms that will sync with the effort, looking forward.\nDuring the past 12 months, the company has conducted extensive customer and market research to better understand the housing, care, and lifestyle wants, needs, and preferences of seniors and their families. To develop the campaign, Brookdale invited its community associates from multiple markets to share the close bonds they have with residents in their communities. A number of those associates were chosen to appear in the national television commercials and in content across various channels and platforms. They include:\nDesiree, resident programs director, Jacksonville, Fla. Elizabeth, Clare Bridge program coordinator, St. Petersburg, Fla. Kevin, dining services director, Chicago, Il. Cam, maintenance technician, San Marcos, Cal. \"All of us at some point will have to choose where and how to live our later years. We want people to appreciate and value the tremendous benefits of innovative senior living and to look to Brookdale as a trusted partner.
