Tonight's show on @dancingabc means so much to me,\" she wrote on Instagram.\nBindi Irwin breaks down following her performance. \n\"It's going to be an emotional and meaningful night for us all. Thank you for taking this journey with us tonight.\"\nAdvertisement As the TV show's audience watched archival footage of an eight-year-old Bindi eulogise her father, the Crocodile Hunter, Bindi revealed that she had never really processed his death.\n\"For the rest of my life I'll kind of feel like he's going to come home,\" she said through heavy tears.\nBindi's emotional connection with the subject matter was matched by her prowess on the dance floor. \nThe teenager has been praised for her grace and technique in recent weeks, and Monday night's contemporary routine was no exception as she and Hough played the roles of adoring daughter and doting father to The Police's Every Step You Take. \nAs the music stopped and the crowd cheered Bindi was inconsolable, crying into the chest of her dance partner. \n\"This dance is for my Dad and for my family for everyone back at home, but for my Dad. This is for him,\" Bindi said.\nThe camera panning through the live studio audience found several openly weeping spectators. \nBut the image of Bindi's younger brother Bob wiping a tear away as sat next to his mother, Terri, captured the power of Bindi's performance for her family.\n\"There cannot possibly be a dry eye left in America, or Australia, or anywhere,\" E Online proclaimed. \nBindi and Hough scored the first '10' of the competition with the dance. \n\"We can't judge the packages we have to judge the actual dance and that dance was breathtaking,\" said judge Julianne Hough.\n  I love you. Thank you for always being with me, wherever I go. \nA photo posted by Bindi Irwin (@bindisueirwin) on Oct 5, 2015 at 8:43pm PDT \n\"[Your Dad] is proud of you.

He has been there to help me on this journey and create something beautiful that means so much to me, for Monday night's show,\" Irwin wrote on Instagram.\n\"His strength and hugs are getting me through this week â€” as a friend and big brother. #TeamCrikey\"\nMonday night's performance is not the first time Bindi has channelled the Croc Hunter during a Dancing With The Stars routine.\nDuring this season's premiere Bindi and Hough danced to the \"Crocodile Rock\", with Irwin striping down from her khakis to glitzy green tassels. \nBindi earned the highest scores of the night for the routine, securing her place one of the favourites to win the DWTS grand final trophy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T09:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T13:42:54.790+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
