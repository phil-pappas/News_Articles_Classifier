That’s first and foremost my mission.”\nBolton is nearing completion on the film, and he shared a trailer for it with members of the media during a news conference at downtown’s Westin Book Cadillac hotel on Thursday afternoon. The footage mixed interviews with Detroit notables — including Aretha Franklin, Smokey Robinson, William Clay Ford Jr., Mayor Mike Duggan, Christopher Ilitch, Alice Cooper, Jerry Bruckheimer, John Varvatos, Mitch Albom and Jason “Slow Roll Jay” Hall — with archival footage of the city and Detroit-centric clips from films such as “Beverly Hills Cop,” “Karate Kid” and “RoboCop.”\nCameras will be rolling during a private gala Friday night at the Fox Theatre, where many of the film’s interview subjects are expected to be in attendance.\nBolton’s interest in Detroit goes back to his childhood, when he was drawn to Motown and the sounds that emanated from Hitsville, U.S.A. Detroit continued to be a thread throughout his career; he opened for Bob Seger during his early years, and he recorded an album of Motown covers, “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough,” in 2013.\nThere are still a few interview subjects Bolton is going after.\n“We’d love Kid Rock, we’d love Madonna, we’d love Eminem, I’d love getting Bob Seger,” said Bolton, who admitted he hasn’t heard a definitive “no” from any of them, but rather silence from his requests. “I’m about to send out, ‘Is that your final answer?’ ”\nA final edit of the film is due to be locked in place Oct. 14, said co-director Christina Kline. Bolton said he’s aiming for the documentary to roll out on the film festival circuit and eventually see a limited theatrical release.\nThe film does not represent the end of his commitment to the city and its revival, Bolton said.\n“I want to see this through,” he said, “and to see this through means I can’t drop it off as a one-off.”\nagraham@detroitnews.com \n@grahamorama", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T20:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:13:04.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
