Having informed his bandmates of his decision earlier this summer, the remaining members today published his statement to their fans. Cosser concluded his time in the band with a string of headline appearances across the U.S. and Mexico as well as completing lyric and vocal duties on the band’s forthcoming EP.\nThe record will punctuate Cosser’s tenure following 2014’s “We Won’t Give Up”, a coproduction that saw Bob Rock (Michael Buble, Metallica, Bryan Adams) and John Fields (Miley Cyrus, The Jonas Brothers, Jimmy Eat World) at the helm. During his time as Charming Liars frontman there were many highlights including four radio singles as well as shows with the likes of Kings of Leon, Chvrches and Jack White.\nIn the statement posted on the band’s Facebook page yesterday, the Anglo-Australian frontman bid farewell:\n\"It is with great sadness that I announce I’ve decided to leave Charming Liars. This was certainly not an easy decision to make. Complete Statement Click Here\nCosser's Hollywood journey began when songwriter / producer John Feldmann (5 Seconds of Summer, Avicii, Good Charlotte) urged the young singer to relocate to Los Angeles after discovering his music online. Narrowly missing out on an opportunity to sign a record deal with Rob Cavallo’s Warner Bros. Music, he and his bandmates were then taken under the wing of grammy award winner David Foster, who later signed the Londoners to his Chartmaker imprint. Throughout the following year, the band crafted their debut record in studios across Los Angeles, Vancouver and Hawaii followed by several national and international tours which saw the rise of an army of devoted fans that Cosser soon dubbed “The New Disorder” - after the band’s first single and EP title.\nIt’s no big secret that the singer-songwriter has also been playing an active role at the business end of the industry with the 2013 launch of his media disruptor, SOAP Communication. Established in a bid to help cutting edge artists build their audiences online, SOAP’s immediate addition of a content production component enticed the interest of labels, brands and agencies in need of their array of creation, publication and promotional services. The company has built successful partnerships with major players such as Universal Music Group’s Capitol and Republic Records as well Euro-fashion retailer - ASOS. They now also boast an eclectic showreel of creative music video content which includes the likes of Ne-Yo, Owl City, Seven Lions, Broods, Nickelback, The Mowglis, Kalin & Myles and Misterwives - much of which has seen widespread viral circulation.\nNow dividing his time between London, Sydney and Los Angeles, Cosser recently shed light on one of the company’s newest ventures - SOAP Broadcasting. \"I am attempting to clarify the confusing maze that is the explosive internet environment; with the benefits, profits and utility to the consumer that proven traditional media continues to provide.\"\nKnown for his \"let 'Em have it\" stage presence, soaring vocals combined with his library of bittersweet pop-rock anthems, he earned himself a legion of young fans. However, the pressures of his burgeoning global media enterprises have forced him to face the inevitable: \"I sadly had to concede that there were but 24 hours in the day.\"\nOfficial Site - www.soapcommunication.com\nFacebook - www.facebook.com/soapcommunication\nShowreel embed - <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SBZQI7g6hKU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n###\nPress Contact - Jennifer Darmafall - SOAP Communication - This email address is being protected from spambots.
