Telling friends of their resolve, one of the friends came up with the name \"Rue the Goat\" with the intent of overturning the curse. They made 35 bottles, complete with label and artwork depicting the banished goat and dismissing its effects.\nMets vs. Cubs: pizza and fatalism Scott Stantis Chicago Tribune editorial cartoonist Scott Stantis and Newsday's Matt Davies team up for another National League Championship Series-themed cartoon.\nChicago Tribune editorial cartoonist Scott Stantis and Newsday's Matt Davies team up for another National League Championship Series-themed cartoon.\n(Scott Stantis) The pinot noir made with Peruvian grapes was reserved solely for other rabid Cubs fans.

They are in the playoffs,\" Paesel said. \"At the beginning of the year, no one picked the Cubs to go to the playoffs. They were 50 to 1 in Vegas to win the World Series.\n\"I like to think the wine we created helped,\" he said.\nRydberg, a trader at the Chicago Board of Trade, and Paesel, a real estate broker with Coldwell Banker in Orland Park, have been friends for 10 years with a shared love for the Cubs and wine.\nIt was Rydberg's wine-making supplies that were used along with Paesel's vision of warding off the dreaded curse.\n\"It was our first attempt (at making wine together), and everyone seems to like it,\" Rydberg said.\nOne of the lucky few who received a bottle was Gregory Byron, of Flossmoor, who grew up in an Italian neighborhood in Chicago Heights where wine making was a given. Byron, who passed the litmus test of a lifelong suffering Cubs fan, said the wine is \"actually wonderful. \"\nCubs fans in Hammond fire up for Game 3 Michelle L.
