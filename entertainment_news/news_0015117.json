County Jail for climbing up 100-foot crane in Hollywood in a protest against SeaWorld back in August. \nSteve-O was sentenced to 30 days in L.A. County Jail on Wednesday, October 7 for climbing up 100-foot crane in Hollywood in a protest against SeaWorld on August 9. The \"Jackass\" star was also sentenced to three years of probation and ordered to reimburse the city nearly $14,000 for the police and fire response. Under the terms of his probation, Steve will have to stay away from the neighborhood where the protest took place, refrain from using fireworks and not perform any stunts which are likely to draw police and fire responders. He is scheduled to report to Jail in December. Steve responded to his jail sentencing with an Instagram post featuring a cartoon depiction of him being locked up next to an Orca whale. He wrote a lengthy message alongside the cartoon, \"Considering I've become a clean and sober, dog-rescuing vegan, I must say I'm ready to go to jail- not just because it will bring so much attention to the plight of orcas in captivity, but because it's nice to let people know I haven't lost my edge.\" The daredevil continued, \"What can I say, I'm a jackass. My whole crane-climbing, fireworks debacle really turned out to be pretty meaningful in the end, too. I mean, if your goal is to make a statement about captivity, you may as well get yourself locked up!\" Steve revealed he launched a campaign in to raise money for \"at-risk, inner-city youth.\" \"To help give back to the City of Los Angeles, I launched a campaign today to raise money for at-risk, inner city youth, by raffling off chances to win an all-expenses-paid trip to be my red carpet, VIP guest at the taping of my Showtime comedy special next month, which is called 'Steve-O: Guilty As Charged'. There is a link to a new crazy stunt video I just made to let people enter to win in my bio,\" he wrote, \"Los Angeles, I love you, thank you for everything!\" A photo posted by Steve-O (@officiallysteveo) on Oct 7, 2015 at 10:13am PDT \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T02:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:57:44.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
