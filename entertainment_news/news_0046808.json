Wearing a vibrant-colored flower dress and matching headdress, she opened the show during her monologue by singing \"My Way\" about the controversies happening over the summer. Miley joked that the only good thing about live TV was \"my parents know where I am for 90 minutes.\" She then sang about the dentist who killed Cecil the Lion, the controversial clerk Kim Davis, the disgraced Subway spokesman Jared Fogle, the embattled reality TV star Josh Duggar, and also \" Lenny Kravitz 's junk.\" Later on the show, Miley delivered \"Karen Don't Be Sad\" and \"Twinkle Song\" from her free album \" Miley Cyrus and Her Dead Petz \". Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who also took part in a sketch making fun of herself, introduced her performance. Also becoming the target of the show during the premiere was Taylor Swift .
