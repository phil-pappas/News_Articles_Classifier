Maine Folklife Center’s Katrina Wynn will present audio clips of stories told by Mainers on topics ranging from logging to Wabanaki culture; and discuss how preserving Maine’s oral histories adds to its sense of place. \nThe vibrant photographic portrait of Maine created by Peggy McKenna (1947-2014) in her work for Down East, Waldo Independent and The Republican Journal will be discussed by former newspaper editor Jay Davis. \nTickets range from $32 to $62.
