Whether it is in music or acting in films or in television or sound tracks or whatever, we’ve all had our side projects.\nEx: So what you do with Blackfoot will be done around Skynryd’s schedule?\nRM: Yes, as long as it doesn’t interfere with Lynyrd Skynryd.\nEx: Is there anything you would like the people to know about these special shows with Blackfoot?\nRM: I think the people old and young should come out and give it a chance and listen to the record when it comes out.
