(Photo: Danny Clinch)\n5 CONNECT 14 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE The Grammy award-winning pair Steve Martin and Edie Brickell have their second album, So Familiar, due out in late October.\nNEW YORK — For Steve Martin and Edie Brickell, it all began with a banjo and a cellphone.\n\"We started recording these songs together,\" recalls the famously multifaceted Martin, who first met Brickell through Paul Simon, his friend and her husband of more than 20 years. While Martin played, Brickell, who rose to fame in the late '80s with the folk-pop band Edie Brickell & New Bohemians, sang, \"and we kind of fell in love with how it sounded. But we knew we needed a little more.\"\nSo Martin, 70, and Brickell, 49, decided to bring their creative love affair into the open, first with the 2013 album Love Has Come For You , which showcased Martin's bluegrass chops — previously on display in collaborations with various leading artists in that genre and on Martin's Grammy Award-winning album, 2009's The Crow: New Songs For the 5-String Banjo — and Brickell's delicate singing and gently whimsical, searching lyrics. The title track earned a Grammy for Best American Roots Song.\nThat partnership continues with So Familiar , out Friday.Like its predecessor, the album was produced by British pop veteran Peter Asher and features an eclectic roster of guests, among them banjo master Béla Fleck and Martin's longtime cohorts the Steep Canyon Rangers. But the arrangements are a bit more lush, with strings prominent on several tracks.\nDiscussing the album in their record company's Midtown offices, Brickell and Martin give their producer credit for the textural evolution. \"It was Peter's imagination that made everything expand into this glorious, majestic sound,\" Brickell says.\nSteve Martin and Edie Brickell, pictured on the cover of their new album, are working on a musical called 'Bright Star.' (Photo: Danny Clinch)\nIn fact, the duo tapped Asher for another, related project: a musical they'e developing, titled Bright Star . The show, for which Asher is serving as music supervisor, features a number of songs from So Familiar and is scheduled to begin performances at Washington's Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on Dec. 2. It will move to Broadway, where previews will start March 7 for a March 31 opening. (The musical had its world premiere at San Diego's Old Globe in 2014.)\n\"Edie and I both love musicals,\" says Martin, citing The Music Man as well as several Rodgers and Hammerstein classics. For Brickell, it was The Sound of Music in particular, which she first experienced through the film adaptation starring Julie Andrews: \"I used to love to sing as I walked, so when I saw her (as Maria) running through those mountains, singing ... I loved her performance, and that character — how she brought love into a house.\"\nThe initial spark for Bright St ar came from an early-20th-century newspaper article spotted by Brickell, also the source for a song on Love Has Come For You , called Sarah Jane and the Iron Mountain Baby. The story (which has been addressed before in folk songs) involves an abandoned infant; the musical, set in the South in the 1920s and '40s, features a young World War II soldier and a female literary editor who discover a connection between them.\nSteve Martin and Edie Brickell pose at the Grammy Awards in 2014.

(Martin became a father himself more recently; he and his wife, Anne Stringfield, have a 2-year-old daughter.)\n\"I'm very lucky that Steve offered me a way out of empty-nest syndrome,\" Brickell says. \"He encourages me — he brings out my best. That's about as exciting as it gets.\"\n5 CONNECT 14 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1S6spy1 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4526632227001_th-560ead5ee4b088f7a4f4874c-672293881001.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://usat.ly/1S6spy1", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/635809543673030966-photocred-Danny-Clinch-3-.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4526632226001_vs-560ead5ee4b088f7a4f4874c-672293881001.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3e662c08c28b8b8852c0654983b49afc67ad8c1f/c=0-35-1500-1163&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/635809546950611976-MartinBrickell-SoFamilar-5x5-RGB.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1LGrm7c", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/635809543673030966-photocred-Danny-Clinch-3-.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4526632226001_vs-560ead5ee4b088f7a4f4874c-672293881001.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34f3c12e46e775b6bc7e523d797ba40d553715a7/r=540&c=540x304/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4526632226001_vs-560ead5ee4b088f7a4f4874c-672293881001.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1S6spy1&text=Edie%20Brickell%20on%20Steve%20Martin%3A%20%27He%20brings%20out%20my%20best%27&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6caf73c69b656338c25047211dac7c286c32823f/c=0-76-1992-2732&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/08/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635750613588527918-STEVEMARTIN-GRAMMYQUOTES.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f38a9e39dabcdcb5b7c422e4ba9825f9b41bca89/c=204-0-3396-2400&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/635809543673030966-photocred-Danny-Clinch-3-.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1S6spy1&mini=true"], "published": "2015-10-26T19:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:49:59.754+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
