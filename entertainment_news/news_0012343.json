Blalock | eblalock@syracuse.com SYRACUSE, N.Y. -- Starting Oct. 19, 5 Wits at Destiny USA will hold a costume contest with two prizes for the most creative and scariest Halloween costumes.\nThe \"most creative\" costume will win the grand prize of a single adventure party for up to 12 people at 5 Wits Syracuse. The \"scariest costume\" winner will receive four VIP passes for any 5 Wits Syracuse adventure. No purchase is necessary.\nBoth winners will be chosen on Halloween, Oct. 31.\nThe 5 Wits costume contest is open to any visitor who stops by in costume during normal business hours, 10 a.m. – 9:30 p.m. Monday-Saturday and 11 a.m. – 6 p.m. Sunday. Entrants will be photographed and the images will be shared on 5 Wits Syracuse social media.\n5 Wits Syracuse is an interactive entertainment venue for adults, college students and children ages seven and older. Though 5 Wits adventures are not marketed as escape room , participants are expect to solve puzzles to move through each adventure.\nThe four adventures are:\nDrago's Castle: In this medieval-themed adventure, participants team up with a tough, smart princess to capture a fire-breathing dragon. Challenges include escaping from the dungeon, solving riddles and navigating through a spooky castle.\nTomb: Adventurers enter a 3,000-year-old tomb and accidentally awaken an angry pharaoh. To avoid being trapped in his burial chamber, players need to team up to solve puzzles in hieroglyphics, decipher clues and beat the pharaoh at his own game.\nEspionage: Players are double-agents who must go deep undercover to break into enemy headquarters, dodge security lasers, hack into the computer system, save the world and get out alive.\nDeep Space: In 5 Wits Syracuse's newest adventure, visitors teleport to an abandoned space ship where they'll need to dodge asteroids, rewire the ship, refuel the power core and defeat a malevolent artificial intelligence program.\nKatrina Tulloch writes features and entertainment stories for Syracuse.com and The Post-Standard.
