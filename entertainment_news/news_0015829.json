Photo: Shaney Balcombe \nIt's like a surprise; such is the nature of pop-ups. The LXÉ pop-up at Stokehouse City launched on Wednesday night for a three-day residency. While guests mused over racks of must-have leather pants, spring separates and hand-sequined tops, and a new range of layers including delicate camis​ and bralettes​, we wondered: when was the last time you were really, truly, surprised? \n\"My friends threw a belated 40th for me in Sydney,\" Natalie Bassingthwaighte​ said. \"I was up there for a trade show and I was thinking I was going out to dinner with four friends, and it ended up being 70 people in this back bar in the middle of Sydney like, two weeks ago.\" Did they go, 'Surprise!' \"Yeah, it was huge.\" And did you cry? \"It was more screaming, and then straight into the drinks.\" \n\"I'm going on a work trip to Paris in November,\" Kristine Brown said, \"and two of my best friends have surprised me and they're coming along. I found out today. I'm really excited.\" \n\"I get surprised every single day because I have a little daughter,\" said Angela Johnson . \"She is constantly making me go (gasp), 'What?' She's one.\" \n\"My girlfriend text messaged that she got engaged,\" Michala Banas​ said. \"Just super casually wrote this long message, they were overseas, and then at the end put, 'By the way, we're engaged.' There was a lot of jumping up and down.\" \n \nA new Star in South Melbourne \nThe Star Hotel launch, South Melbourne \nIn life there are situations in which you star and situations in which you are worse than awful. The trick is, of course, to put yourself in the former more frequently than the latter. On Thursday night at the launch of the Star Hotel in South Melbourne (Star Bar, in a previous incarnation) we wanted to know, in what situation do you star? \nSeb Costello answered for his cousin Elliot Costello . \"Elliot's very good at re-gifting Christmas presents. He doesn't like anything I give him and then handballs it off to the charity (YGAP), of course. That's kind of the way I donate.\" \nAnd Elliot? \"Seb stars in the backyard cricket matches when he's on a team with my brother and me. If he's not on our cricket team he gets left standing very stranded, so he won't win. We do feel sorry for this side of the Costello family so we pick 'em on the right team just so the following year's a good year for Seb.\" \n\"Yes, well, that's right,\" Seb said,. \"This side, of course, is charity in profession and charity in personality so, you know, we do our best.\" \n \nFashionable room with a view \nKookai spring racing collection showing, the Olsen \nOn Thursday night we were invited to a viewing inside a room with a view. It was the Kookai spring racing collection showing in the John Olsen penthouse, high up in the Olsen. We wondered, what is the best room with a view you've ever been to? \n\"Vegas, the Bellagio, when we were with the family,\" Dani Shreeve​ said. You were at the Bellagio with the family? \"It was tame, it was tame. I was in year 10, I was a baby.\" \n\"A penthouse apartment in SoHo, in New York city, that a boy took me to,\" Tess Shanahan said. \"It probably wasn't so much the view but the fact that I was in the penthouse. It was friggin' beautiful. It was a great adventure in New York city, it was the first time I'd been there.\" \nWe kind of had an idea about what The Bachelor 's Snezana Markoski​ might say. \"In Sydney, when I was with Sam, the Opera House date. After being locked up in the house, that was an amazing view.\" You probably would have had a good time even if there wasn't a view … \"Yeah, I think I would have.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:51:58.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
