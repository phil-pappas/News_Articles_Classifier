The film, she says, happened at a time when she was not looking for work exactly. “I had planned to take a year off to groom myself and prepare for films. But then I got a call from the film’s casting director Mukesh Chhabra and finally got selected to play Esha,” Sanah says. Initially, she had kept the news all to herself. “I hadn’t told my family about the audition even though bhaiya (Shahid) was doing the film. My father (Pankaj Kapoor) came on board a month after I did. When I broke the news to them, their expression was priceless. I had to put on 10-15 kilos for the role but it’s part of the job.” Coming from a film background, one wouldn’t expect to see her making a debut as a supporting actress. Sanah agrees. “Yes, many people told me I could get a lead role, that I would get work irrespective of whether I am good or bad just because of my family name. But I chose to take another route.” Moving to life off screen, we get to know that she shares a great bond with her sister-in-law Mira. “We are the same age and we got along like a house on fire, even before the wedding. I call her bhabhi and she hates it. We are all so happy for bhaiya. Mira is just perfect for him. Right now she is anxiously waiting to watch our film,” she says.
