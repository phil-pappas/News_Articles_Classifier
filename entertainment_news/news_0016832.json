Luckily, the car company is providing some early information on what consumers can expect from the new model of the brand. This time around, additional details about the car's interiors have been revealed and as expected, it has remained to live up to its reputation of providing a comfort to its driver and passengers. \nAccording to Indian Cars Bikes , a spy shot of the E-Class Benz shows how the dashboard looks very similar to the S-Class. The E-Class' front center console, in the meantime, resembles that of its younger sibling, the C-Class. Its appearance is notably very stylish and as Master Herald puts it, the company designers seem to have been experimenting with some more creative ideas for the general layout. \nAlthough first look resembles that of a combination of S-Class and C-Class, there are actually attributes in the E-Class that makes it unique and different from the previous model. A closer look at the layout and setup of the new model will make one notice the personality of the car. \nLodged on the gloss black dashboard is the central console that houses the COMAND controller, which comes along with a touchpad, a storage compartment, extra infotainment control buttons and other related climate control. The four round-shaped central air vents make a comeback looking just like in the S-Class, as well as the sporty three-spoke steering wheel. The clock is no longer on the same position as it has been moved lower, right below the air-con buttons. In the last level is the large screen that is continued to its left with a partially analog instrument cluster. \nMoreover, users can expect the new E-Class to be equipped with safety tech just like the Evasive Steering Assist, Active Brake Assist, PRE-SAFE Plus, beltbag and Attention Assist. It will also be the first time that the Mercedes' Remote Parking System will be introduced. Through this innovation, the car will be able to park itself in a given parking spot. A Car-to-X communication system will also be incorporated. \nFurther details of the E-Class will be revealed at the 2016 Detroit Motor Show and is expected to go on sale sometime in the middle of next year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T06:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T11:01:06.641+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
