Many riders have said that the shuttle buses added significant time to their commutes. Some downtown Skokie retailers reported noticeable decline in business while others said they were not impacted.\n\"We appreciate the continued community support for the numerous businesses near the Yellow Line stations that rely on commuters as customers, and we hope that ridership will quickly return to the levels attained before the unfortunate service interruption,\" Skokie Mayor George Van Dusen said last week in a prepared statement.\nVan Dusen thanked the community for its patience throughout nearly six months of the Yellow Line being down.\n\"The village monitored the CTA and MWRD's handling of this system failure and we are reassured that our concern for local riders was heard,\" he said.\nA ceremonial first ride — or at least a first return ride — has been scheduled for the morning of Oct. 30 at the Yellow Line downtown Skokie station on Oakton Street. Skokie Mayor George Van Dusen and CTA President Dorval R. Carter Jr. will be joined by officials of the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District for the ride on a historic train, the CTA announced.\nThe vintage 2400-series rail cars will roll in celebration of the Yellow Line's return. A CTA spokesman also said that two of the CTA's newest 5000-series rail cars — the last to be delivered from an order of 714 cars as part of the CTA's ongoing modernization of its rail fleet — will also be in service.\nCTA Spokesman Jeff Tolman said that the time of the Oct. 30 first ride and more details about the Yellow Line free rides for a week will be forthcoming.\nFollowing suspension of the Yellow Line in May, the village began providing parking at the Dempster station for free while shuttle buses took the place of trains. That free parking will last until 2016, the CTA announced.\nEven though service doesn't officially begin again until Oct. 30, community members may see and hear Yellow Line trains traveling on Skokie tracks before then.\nUntil Oct. 30, the CTA said, it will be conducting track maintenance, inspection and testing — including running test trains.\n\"The Yellow Line is a significant part of our transit system and the village of Skokie in linking residents from the north suburbs to Chicago quickly and efficiently,\" Tolman said.\nThe CTA, he said, is taking great efforts to let people know about the reopening including customer fliers, signs at stations and key bus stops, social media, customer audio alerts, messages on the CTA's digital information screen system, door-to-door outreach with Skokie and a countdown clock that will go up on the CTA website.\nmisaacs@pioneerlocal.com\nTwitter: @SKReview_Mike\n Chicago Transit Authority Skokie", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5626e542/turbine/ct-skr-yellow-line-plans-tl-1029-20151020"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:19:26.642+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
