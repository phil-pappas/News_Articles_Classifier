Though Faith will be co-executive producer, she won’t be a permanent host, according to Billboard , but will make occasional guest appearances. \nKellie Pickler is the show’s first host, with announcements about one or two other co-hosts yet to come. \n“This is a woman who has so many talents,” Faith says of the American Idol alum. “Kellie is smart, compassionate, funny, quick-witted and has a heart for service-- the work she’s done with the USO and our servicemen and women is no secret. She possesses the ability to reach far beyond the camera and into the hearts of people, allowing you to feel immediately connected to her. There was no question in my mind that she should be a big part of this show.” \nThough it may not be widely known, this isn’t Faith’s first stint as a television producer: she's worked behind-the-scenes on all of her specials and music videos, from their conception to their completion. She expects to reveal the name of the new show in the coming weeks. \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
