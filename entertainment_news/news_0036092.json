Each tour has a different theme, such as, \"Go Figure: Examining Female Forms in the 21st Century.\" \nFor the first time this year, there will be a tour on bikes led by Rolling Orange Bike Tours, and another that's fully accessible for people in wheelchairs. \nCurator Sarah Kate Beaumont will be joined by disability-rights advocate Danielle Sheypuk on the wheelchair-accessible tour. The two worked together to make sure art at each venue will be hung so people in wheelchairs can see it, and woodworkers made small ramps to ensure that wheelchairs can travel through doorways. \n\"We didn't want to just say it's wheelchair accessible because there's an elevator in the building, we wanted it to be honest-to-goodness wheelchair accessible,\" said Abby Subak, director of Arts Gowanus, which runs Gowanus Open Studios. \n► Rally to Support Displaced Artists \nNow in its 19th year, Gowanus Open Studios has grown from just 10 artists to about 342. However a handful of artists had to drop out this year after they lost their studio spaces in a Ninth Street building that recently changed management. \nSubak said roughly 400 artists will eventually be displaced from the building, calling it a disturbing reminder of the difficulties working artists face in the city's overheated real estate climate. \nOn Saturday morning at 10:30 a.m., Arts Gowanus and the Artist Studio Affordability Project will co-host a rally to support the displaced artists in front of 94 Ninth St., near Second Avenue. \n► Art by Young Residents of the Gowanus Houses \nThe recently formed Gowanus Houses Art Collective will exhibit photos by young residents of the Gowanus Houses public housing complex at St. Lydia's Dinner Church at 304 Bond St. \n\"The photos are an amazing glimpse into how kids from the Gowanus Houses see their neighborhood and the surrounding area,\" said GHAC co-founder Chris O’Falt. \n► Beat Nite Visits Gowanus \nThe arts collective Norte Maar, which recently moved from Bushwick to East New York, is bringing its Beat Nite gallery hop to Gowanus for the first time on Friday night, when 10 galleries and art venues throughout the neighborhood will stay open until 10 p.m. \nFor more information on Gowanus Open Studios 2015, including a downloadable map of studios, visit Arts Gowanus .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T00:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:48:22.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
