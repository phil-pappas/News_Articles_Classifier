It was first introduced on the silver screen in the very first film starring the super-spy, the classic Dr. No from 1962 starring Sean Connery as 007.In the film, Dr. No (Joseph Wiseman), who had metal prostheses in place of his lost hands, reveals to Bond that he belongs to the criminal network. \n'Bumps and bruises' Bautista, who stands at 6'4\" (1.93 meters) and whose enormous biceps are liberally tattooed, certainly looks the part of a formidable Bond nemesis.But he said the choreographed on-screen fighting with the spy in the form of Daniel Craig did not always go smoothly, despite his time as a wrestler and mixed martial artist.\"There were lots of bumps and bruises,\" Bautista said. \"Daniel hurt his knee.\"Did he emerge unscathed? \"Dan punched me in the nose,\" he said.Bautista had more tender remembrances of his interaction with his female co-stars.He admitted to going weak in the knees around Italian actress Monica Bellucci, calling her \"breathtakingly beautiful but extremely sexy.\"As for French actress Lea Seydoux, who also appears in the movie, Bautista was impressed by her soft beauty.\"There's something almost angelic about her,\" he said. \"When she smiles, she lights up a room.\" \nYouth of hard knocks Bautista, an American of Filipino descent, grew up in a neighbourhood where violence and crime were common.As a teenager, Bautista discovered bodybuilding, which he credits as ending his stint as an underage car thief.He worked as a bouncer, and in the 2000s launched a career as a professional wrestler. He won the World Wrestling Entertainment heavyweight championship six times, garnering along the way an enthusiastic following among wrestling fans.Bautista gets nostalgic when remembering his days as star of the ring.\"Sometimes I miss the entertainment aspect of it,\" he said.A key influence in his move to acting was another wrestler - The Rock, now better known as Dwayne Johnson, star of action films including several in the Fast and Furious series.Bautista's Hollywood adventure began in 2006 in minor television roles, which led to big-screen parts in The Man with the Iron Fists (2012) with Russell Crowe and Lucy Liu, and Riddick (2013) with Vin Diesel.His biggest hit came as Drax the Destroyer, one of a crew of misfits led by Chris Pratt in last year's Guardians of the Galaxy .The Disney/Marvel studio film, a global megahit, turbo-charged his career.In upcoming movies, Bautista will star in Heist along with Robert De Niro, Marauders with Bruce Willis, and as the main villain in a remake of the Jean-Claude Van Damme 1980s action film Kickboxer .Of course, Bautista will also return as Drax in a Guardians sequel.He is however modest about his success.\"I don't want to be a movie star,\" he said. \"I want to play great characters.\" \nWatch the trailer here:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:15:56.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
