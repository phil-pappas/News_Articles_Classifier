Ayed al-Moradi, a Yemeni military official. \nLater on Wednesday, the United Nations announced that the rebels had accepted a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for an end to the fighting. \nSirwah is about 88 kilometers (55 miles) east of the rebel-held capital, Sanaa. The forces’ advance on the town had been stalling for weeks in Marib. \nHouthis said they repelled attacks amid airstrikes from the Saudi-led coalition but Yemen’s pro-government satellite TV broadcast footage of bodies and destroyed tanks and armored vehicles from inside Sirwah. \nThe head of forces in Marib from the United Arab Emirates, which are part of the Saudi-led coalition, also confirmed the town’s fall. Emirati Brig. Gen. Ali Saif al-Kaabi told the satellite TV channel that the Marib province is now under anti-Houthi forces’ control. \nAccording to medical officials, 70 Houthis and more than 50 pro-government fighters were killed in three days of fighting over the town. Witnesses in the town said few Houthi pockets still remain in Sirwah. \nThe anti-rebel alliance’s goal is to retake the Houthi-held capital, which the rebels captured a year ago, but that still remains a long and difficult challenge. \nFrom Marib, the anti-Houthi forces plan to advance in two directions, said al-Moradi. One push will be to the west to Khawlan, a mountainous region on the way to Sanaa, and the other push will be in another direction, through Jawf province, he said. \nObstacles along the road west of Marib include more than 10,000 land mines planted by the Houthis, according to another Yemeni military official. The pro-government forces have removed about 3,000 of them as of Tuesday evening, he said. \nThe military official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media while witnesses in Sirwah declined to give their names for fear of reprisals. \nU.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the rebels accepted an April 14 Security Council resolution calling for the withdrawal of rebel forces from all areas they have seized and a halt to undermining the country’s political transition. It also imposed an arms embargo on Houthi leaders and their key supporters, former President Ali Abdullah Saleh and his son. \nIn another development Wednesday, the Houthi-run SABA news agency said rebel fighters targeted and hit a warship from the Saudi-led coalition that was stationed in Bab al-Mandab Strait, the strategic southern entrance to the Red Sea and the gateway to the Suez Canal. \nThe report could not be independently confirmed late Wednesday and coalition officials were not available for comment.
