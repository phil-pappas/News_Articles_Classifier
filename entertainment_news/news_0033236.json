That stunted his development as a catcher. Schwarber played left field adequately until the final two games of the National League Championship Series, but the Cubs already had planned to have him work with catching coach Mike Borzello next spring.\n\"Until we reach a point where we think it's not the right path, we're going to continue to expose him to both (positions),\" Epstein said.\nPoints of emphasis: In addition to adding starting pitching, Epstein stressed situational hitting, holding baserunners and outfield defense as areas in need of improvement.\n\"Situational hitting will be a big emphasis in spring training,\" said Epstein, whose Cubs batted .236 with runners in scoring position and .211 with runners in scoring position with two outs.\nThe Mets exposed the Cubs' inability to hold runners during the NLCS, and the defense in the corner outfield positions was questionable.\nEpstein said the Cubs would continue to move players around to enhance their versatility.\n\"Young players do get better defensively with work, and we do plan to work,\" Epstein said.\nEpstein also endorsed pitcher Jason Hammel despite a rough second half and playoff game.\n\"He's going to come back and be an important member of our starting rotation,\" Epstein said. \"He is that guy we saw in the first half when he's 100 percent and locked in. It's our job to get him that way for the first half. \"\nExtra innings: The coaching staff will return intact for 2016. The Cubs will look internally to replace Derek Johnson, the minor league pitching coordinator who will become the Brewers' pitching coach. … Longtime scout Ken Kravec and Double-A Tennessee pitching coach Storm Davis are no longer with the organization. … Epstein witnessed a magician's performance in the Cubs' clubhouse before Game 4 of the NLCS. \"It didn't work, but it was good,\" Epstein said.\nPrivacy Policy Major League Baseball Chicago Cubs Kyle Schwarber National League Championship Series Spring Training Milwaukee Brewers", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5629a4f9/turbine/ct-kyle-schwarber-bits-cubs-spt-1023-20151022"], "published": "2015-10-23T06:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:20:42.119+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
