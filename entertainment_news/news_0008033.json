Mark D. Campbell is a detailed account of God’s work both present and past.\n(PRWEB) October 21, 2015\nRev. Mark D. Campbell, a Christian, minister, researcher, devoted writer and author, has completed his new book “Stories from the Bible”: a gripping and potent work that depicts the stories of the Bible and how God worked miracles both in the Biblical days and the twenty-first century.\nPublished by New York City-based Page Publishing, Rev. Mark D. Campbell’s religious book will open the reader’s eyes to God’s love, blessings and marvels.\nThis book was written as an explanation of how the Bible can be used to show how God worked in the world during Biblical times and how he works in the super scientific world of the Twenty First Century. This explains how God created “all that existed” and how he rates and super rates our modern space age and atomic age.\nReaders who wish to experience this inspiring work can purchase “Stories from the Bible” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708.\nAbout Page Publishing\nPage Publishing is a traditional New York based full-service publishing house that handles all of the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
