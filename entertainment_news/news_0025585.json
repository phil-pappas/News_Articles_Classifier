Especially since Cormac McCarthy’s The Road in 2006, they have also become a fascination with both the writers and readers of what typically gets referred to as literary fiction. Within just the last year or so, we’ve seen Emily St. John Mandel’s Station Eleven , Edan Lepucki’s California , Laura van den Berg’s Find Me , and Benjamin Percy’s The Dead Lands , to name only a few. And now Claire Vaye Watkins, who won the prestigious Story Prize with her first book, Battleborn (2012), has entered the arena. With Gold Fame Citrus , Watkins magnifies and extends California’s current drought until it becomes the stuff of true nightmare. The Mojave and Sonoran deserts now “licked the bases of glaciers,” and the Southwest has gone “moonscape with sinkage, as the winds came and as Phoenix burned and as a white-hot superdune entombed Las Vegas.” Like the inverse of the Dust Bowl Okies fleeing west in the 1930s, many “Mojavs” flee east--and receive a welcome just as unfriendly--and then, as the situation grows more dire, the rest are evacuated to camps. But not everyone leaves. Some stubbornly refuse, as do Luz and Ray. Once they adopt/kidnap a neglected toddler whom they christen Ig (after the only sound she makes), however, they too began trekking east in search of a better life. What they run into are the Amargosa Dune Sea and Levi Zabriskie. The Amargosa is an enormous, ever-growing, ever-shifting mountain of sand that has never been circumnavigated or crossed. Levi Zabriskie is the charismatic leader of a peripatetic colony that survives along the Amargosa’s spreading edge. In Battleborn , Watkins’ stories concerned themselves with the unforgiving landscape of the Southwest (especially Nevada) and the odd, off-kilter sorts who have been--and continue to be--drawn to its inhospitality and isolation. Gold Fame Citrus ( which is named after the three things that once drew people west) intensifies this preoccupation by extending her historical and contemporary exploration of the region and its people into the future. Ecologically damaged beyond repair, the region now attracts an even more peculiar and desperate sort. Or, rather, does the Amargosa itself summon them, as Levi Zabriskie claims? Regardless of what draws them, what seizes them once they get there is Levi, a water dowsing, scientist/naturalist/prophet who earns their unwavering loyalty by means of a combination of charm, ideology, and “brute root,” a numbing drug. In Luz, he soon gains a new and enthusiastic follower. While Gold Fame Citrus begins as a frightening and mostly credible portrait of where our careless and wasteful ways could eventually lead us, it gradually becomes more of an examination of the beliefs and methods of the Amargosa colony’s leader. Are his strategies the work of a savior or a charlatan? Are his plans for Luz and Ig commendable or contemptible? To a great extent, our desire to learn the answers to questions such as these becomes the primary force that continues to drive us forward. Such a shift in focus may disappoint those readers who come to this novel expecting nothing more than yet another foray into a future that punishes our descendants for our mistakes, but Watkins’ interest in figures such as Levi Zabriskie comes as no real surprise considering her connection to the Manson Family. In Battleborn ’s first story, “Ghosts, Cowboys,” as well as in numerous interviews, Watkins has been forthright in acknowledging that she is the daughter of Paul Watkins, who was one of Charles Manson’s most trusted followers. Knowledge of this is difficult for one to ignore while reading this novel, especially once one remembers the Family’s Death Valley hideout, which was where they intended to wait out the Apocalypse. Ultimately, however, the novel mostly succeeds neither because of nor despite Levi’s commandeering of the plot. What carries the most force and leaves the most indelible impression is its feverish, heat-addled language, which brings to life the beginning of the world’s last days in ways that are both frightening and beautiful. Where it does falter, however, is in its final quarter. Relying too much on melodrama to resolve and conclude, it leaves us with a final image that is difficult to accept, especially after having seen so much that is so difficult to forget. Nevertheless, despite this tailing off toward the end, Gold Fame Citrus is thoroughly captivating and haunting, just as all sinister prophecies should be. \nKevin Grauke is the author of Shadows of Men, a collection of stories.
