I didn't see four (runs) in the first inning.\"\nIt was not the kind of outing Maddon envisioned when he announced Hammel would start the critical Game 4 rather than have Jon Lester come back on three days' rest.\n\"A lot of times pitchers don't do that well on three days' rest, so why even take that risk right now when you know you have to win more than just one game?\" Maddon asked.\nHammel's outing answered that question.\nThe Mets put up four runs on Hammel in the first. Leadoff hitter Curtis Granderson banged out a single and it was clear the Mets had Hammel in their sights. The onslaught's big blow in the opening inning was Lucas Duda's long, three-run homer into the right-field bleachers. The blast came two pitches after Hammel fired a 2-2 fastball on the outside edge of the plate that home plate umpire Paul Emmel called a ball.\nPhotos from Game 4 of the NLCS at Wrigley Field.\nTravis d'Arnaud followed with another homer to give the Mets a 4-0 lead and a smattering of boos cascaded down from the stands.\nHammel issued a one-out walk to David Wright in the second and that prompted Maddon to make a change. Wright eventually scored on Duda's double and that closed the book on Hammel — and effectively the Cubs' season.\n\"If you look again, the base hit by Granderson to left field is a 95 mph fastball,\" Maddon said. \"(Hammel's) stuff has been good.\"\nAt 33 and making his sixth postseason appearance after having pitched for the Rockies, Orioles and Cubs in the playoffs, Hammel said going into the game he wouldn't put pressure on himself in the win-or-go-home situation.\n\"The deeper you get into the playoffs, I guess you could say that they're the most difficult (starts) in my life,\" Hammel said.\nMaddon was hoping Hammel would flash the form the veteran displayed during the early part of the season.\n\"He really got off well,\" Maddon said. \"(He had) very impressive stuff and command. Then he … injured his leg.\n\"Coming back from that has not nearly been the same, primarily talking about command. If you look at the numbers on the gun, reading his fastball velocity, slider velocity, whatever, they've been pretty much the same. It's just a matter of throwing it where he wants to.\"\nIn Game 4, that did not come close to happening.\nckuc@tribpub.com\nTwitter @ChrisKuc\nPrivacy Policy Copyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Major League Baseball Baseball Jason Hammel Joe Maddon Chicago Cubs New York Mets David Wright", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56285e37/turbine/ct-jason-hammel-kuc-cubs-sider-spt-1022-20151021", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56286b84/turbine/ct-nlcs-game-4-photos-cubs-vs-mets-20151021"], "published": "2015-10-22T08:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:19:55.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
