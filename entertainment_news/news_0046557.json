It filed the lawsuit last week.\nThe Los Angeles Times reported Monday (http://lat.ms/1Gt4Vwy) the house where the actress lived for one year was torn down days before a hearing on whether to consider making it a historic monument.\nCity staffers didn't recommend considering the house as a monument since Monroe didn't break into the film industry until years later.\nThe demolition permit was obtained before the monument application was filed, city officials said.\nMonroe \"only resided at the property for one year and did not live in the unit during the productive period of her career,\" a report by city planning officials concluded.\nThe residents' group, called Save Valley Village, countered that the home captured the essence of Monroe's life at a critical stage.\n\"While Norma Jean was born at County Hospital in Lincoln Heights, Marilyn Monroe's career was born while living in this house,\" the lawsuit states.\nThe group also claims the council illegally cut a deal to support any development project supported by the council member who represents the area.\n\"If your hands are bound by a behind-the-scenes voting agreement, then obviously you're not deliberating in public,\" said Richard MacNaughton, an attorney representing the residents' group.\nThe city is reviewing the complaint.\nVanessa Rodriguez, spokeswoman for council President Herb Wesson, said she had not seen the details of the lawsuit but saw no issue, in general, with council members listening to the lawmaker who represents the area of a new project.\n\"The locally elected representative is the best equipped individual to provide their City Council colleagues with guidance\" on issues in that district, Rodriguez told the newspaper.\nPolitics & Government Company Legal & Law Matters Marilyn Monroe City Council", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:24:39.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
