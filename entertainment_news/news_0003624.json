Ankit displayed his patient side by not only sacrificing his luggage for partner Arvind but also by dealing with his loud snores in the night. Ankit happily borrowed clothes from Arvind, donned tattoos like him and even addressed him as 'motu bhai'.\n\nThe duo did fairly well in their first luxury budget task and won points for the housemates. Ankit remained unaffected by ex-flame Roopal Tyagi's presence in the house but was seen playfully taunting her at several occasions. Initially he chose not to speak to Roopal but got along very well with her partner Digangana. However, they further broke the ice and were also seen spending time with each other. Upon Ankitâ€™s exit from the house, Roopal was seen crying incessantly clearly displaying her affection for him.\nSpeaking about his journey in the 'Bigg Boss 9' house, Ankit Gera said, \"I had a great time inside the 'Bigg Boss' house and it was a wonderful experience. I was fortunate to get a partner like Arvindji who took care of me like a younger brother. I feel we made a great pair and I am going to miss him a lot. While my stay in the house was a brief one, if given a chance to go back, I would most definitely take up the opportunity!\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:00:20.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
