Since the first teaser didn't come out on Vijayadasami day, many thought that Balakrishna's film might not release for Sankranthi festival. But the teaser is out now and the reason for the delay cited was that Balakrishna was busy attending Amaravathi foundation laying stone ceremony on the festival day. In the teaser, Balayya shouts that history is in blood and confirms that the movie would hit on Sankranthi 2016. NTR's Nannaku Prematho has already confirmed its berth for the next Pongal as the movie is hitting on January 9th. With no other big stars movies coming out during Pongal, it is now clear that the direct fight is going to be between babai and abbayi. It is no secret that Balakrishna and NTR don't share cordial relations now and in fact Balakrishna's fans were reportedly spreading bad talk against NTR movies when they released in the last two years.\nSource: greatandhra.com Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:19:20.581+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
