Masks allow one to be something they are not - even Batman uses one!\nPark Ridge, IL (PRWEB) October 13, 2015\nSarantos Releases a Fun New Pop Music Video For \"You (just) Don't Have It\" Just In Time For Halloween Emphasizing That Men Don't Always Care About Fame & Money.\nHalloween often means a night to pretend you are someone else. Halloween can be a wonderful escape from reality. Who doesn't love to impersonate and mislead once in a while? Masks allow one to be something they are not. Even Batman uses one!\nIn today's world, teens and adults have a hard enough time trying to find their place in the world. Being true to oneself isn't always encouraged at work, in love, in the media or sadly even in the real world. Perfection is not attainable yet it is a common illusion on full display in movies, TV shows and most media outlets. As this song lightheartedly points out though, perfection is not what everyone wants or desires. Why should they? The real world is full of imperfections and they are something all of us should accept and embrace. Being human means being imperfect.\nThis latest pop music video mirrors the playful nature of the song. No matter how much that perfect stuck-up rich girl wants Sarantos, she just doesn't have what he really wants. The video then describes what Sarantos truly desires - a humble human, playful, not lazy, sweet and nice, with passionate eyes... Money and looks aren't really important and in today's world, that message is like a breath of fresh air, isn't it??\n\"This is a fun video about a hot rich girl who's used to getting what she always wants\" says Sarantos. \"But for me, she just doesn't have it. She doesn't have what my soul desires. She's not sweet and nice, or humble and innocent. Today's world is super busy and fast paced but every movie and TV show is full of perfect people acting perfectly and it's such a poor reflection of the real world. Love is a magical moment in time and is different for everyone. There is no script. There are no rules. There's nothing wrong with love that's not perfect because love never is!\"\nSarantos recently started using a new social media platform & has many exclusives coming soon:\nhttp://www.empowr.com/sarantosmelogia\nSarantos won the Akademia LA Music Awards in 2015 for Best Song (What If I Never See You Again), Best Rock Song (Easy To Believe), Best Rock Music Video (We Accept The Love We Think We Deserve), Best Singer/Songwriter Song (A Mission Of Heart, I Sing), Best Pop Song (I Sing) & Best Pop Rock Album (Not Where I Wanna Be).\nSarantos has won twelve Beat 100 song & music video awards in 2015 and 2014. Sarantos was nominated for the International Music & Entertainments Awards in 2015 for “Rock Song of the Year” and in 2014 for “Rock Song of the Year” and “Pop Album of the Year.” In 2014, he was also nominated for the Hollywood Songwriting Awards for Best Unsigned Song (Are You Sure You Can Last).\nEven without a label or radio promoters, Sarantos song “What If I Never See You Again” has been in the top 200 on the majors list in the US for radio airplay according to the Digital Radio Tracker Top 200 charts. On the independent charts, Sarantos is still in the top 10. He's been on both these lists since early April.\n33% of any music-related sales profits from this song are going straight to Girl Effect.\nGirl Effect works to break the cycle of intergenerational poverty. They do this by connecting girls to each other and to the critical assets they need. They work to create lasting perception change by harnessing media in innovative ways and building social networks to develop girls' positive perceptions of themselves and shift how others see and value them.\n*Because Sarantos wants his music shared throughout the world, fans can always find all of his songs, lyric sheets, videos and books on his website for free.
