Then I saw her at all the Jingle Ball shows. Then we got to actually hang, and we just became close.'' \nDemi praised Iggy as ''very, very real'', saying that she loves being friends with someone who tells it like it is. \nShe explained: ''She's so awesome. She's very, very, very real. What you see is what you get. I think sometimes that pushes people away, but that's what I admire about her. She's the furthest thing from fake.'' \nAnd the pair are now so close that Iggy even appears on the track 'Kingdom' - which features on Demi's upcoming album 'Confident'. \nDemi explained: ''When we finally made the decision of which songs were making the album I said 'OK I want her on this one.' So I called her and was like, 'Hey will you do a song?' \n''And she's like, 'Yeah sure I'll go into the studio tonight.'''
