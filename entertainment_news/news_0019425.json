The Moon is in Libra. Aries (March 21-April 19) \nUpsets with partners and close friends are likely today. You will notice that you are restless and impatient. Examine your feelings. Why are you restless? What is it that you really want? Use this energy today to clarify things for yourself. Taurus (April 20-May 20) \nYour work routine will be interrupted today because of computer crashes, fire drills, canceled meetings, staff shortages and broken equipment. You might have a sudden health concern as well. If so, consider it a wake-up call for something. Take heed. Gemini (May 21-June 20) \nParent should be extra vigilant today because this is an accident-prone day for your kids. This is also the classic day where social engagements will be canceled. Likewise, romantic quarrels might take place because upsets and detours frazzle the mind. Cancer (June 21-July 22) \nA family argument might take place today because people feel independent, even rebellious. Cooperation is not easy. In fact, quite the opposite. There might suddenly be a radical departure from a previous agreement. Just be patient with others to cope as best you can. Leo (July 23-Aug. 22) \nSlow down and pay attention to everything you say and do because this is an accident-prone day for your sign. Forewarned is forearmed. Be careful you don’t burst out something that you later regret. On the upside, you might have bright ideas or a radical new take on something. Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22) \nBe careful with your money today. Financial deals could be upset. Keep your eyes open because you might find money or lose money. If shopping, count your change and keep your receipts. (Don’t throw away the box.) All financial transactions are subject to change today. (No pun intended.) Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22) \nWild, wacky Uranus opposes the Sun in your sign today, which could trigger arguments with others or an upset to your plans. Definitely things will change or be different from the way they are now. A partner or close friend might do or say something that surprises you. Scorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21) \nThis is a restless day for you. However, you can learn something about yourself if you try to think of why you are restless. It means you want something to be different than the way it is now. What do you want to be different? What changes would you like to see? Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21) \nA friend might surprise you or perhaps a member of a group. You might also think that someone has changed an arrangement or a negotiation because some kind of news will catch you off guard today. Some of you might meet a real character. It’s not a boring day! Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19) \nRelations with authority figures are wild and unpredictable today. If your boss or parent or someone in a position of power says or does something that upset you, be cool. Don’t quit your day job. Guard against knee-jerk reactions that might get you in hot water. Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18) \nAvoid controversial subjects today because people are easily argumentative. In addition to which, travel plans will likely change today. Detours are likely. Delays and upsets are par for the course. This is also an accident-prone day for you so be careful. Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20) \nDoublecheck all details regarding inheritances, taxes, debt and shared property today because something could be wrong or quickly go off the rails. Stay on top of these details. Also be very careful about anything for which you have responsibility, like other people’s property. If Your Birthday Is Today \nActor Matt Bomer (1977) shares your birthday today. You are sensuous and pleasure loving. You like to be at the center of things because you want to know what’s going on, socially speaking. In particular, you are a good friend to others. This year your success lies with others. People will benefit you. Therefore, make friends and join clubs and organizations. Help others because you will also be helping yourself.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:15:38.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
