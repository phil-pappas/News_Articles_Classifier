Yet, victims also include men, teens, children, elderly adults and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.\nThey point to these statistics: One in three women and one in four men have been victims of some form of physical violence by an intimate partner within their lifetimes.\nIn addition, one in 15 children are exposed to this type of violence -- and 90 percent of these children are eyewitnesses to abuse.\nCondon and more than a dozen parishioners at Our Lady of the Wayside were moved to start the new ministry after a presentation one year ago by the Rev. Charles Dahm, director of the Domestic Violence Outreach program for the Archdiocese of Chicago.\nWhat started with a domestic abuse ministry Dahm began at a church in Pilsen, has now spread to more than 50 parishes in Cook and Lake counties.\n\"Our group is dedicated to building awareness and offering guidance and referrals to those affected by family violence,\" Condon said. \"This volunteer work has been so rewarding, but it makes me realize the greatness of the need, even in comfortable Arlington Heights.\"\nA variety of speakers will headline Sunday's vigil, including the Rev. Corey Brost, president of St. Viator High School, state Sen. Matt Murphy, and Kristin Eby, coordinator of victim services with the Arlington Heights Police Department. Representatives of WINGS, Alexian Brothers Behavioral Health Hospital and CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates) also will take part.\nTerri McDonnell, coordinator of the Stepping Stones ministry at St. James Parish, said the vigil is a first-time effort aimed at educating the\ncommunity about family violence and empowering those in need to seek out the resources available to victims and their loved ones.\n\"Domestic violence, child abuse, dating violence and elder abuse happen in all communities, even in Arlington Heights,\" McDonnell said. \"We know that abuse is underreported and that victims often suffer in silence. By shining a light on abuse, rather than covering it up, we pray that we can help families begin to heal.\"\nEvents Sunday begin with a Mass at 5 p.m., celebrated by Brost, at St. James, 820 N. Arlington Heights Road in Arlington Heights. Upon its completion, worshippers will walk four blocks south, in a candlelight procession, to North School Park for the prayer vigil. Music will be provided by choral students from St. Viator High School.\nWhile organizers hope the message of the vigil hits home, the images from the park may make a lasting impression, from the hundreds of candles expected, to the silent witness silhouettes spread out across the park, symbolizing those who have died as a result of domestic violence.\nFor more information, call the National Domestic Violence Hotline, (800) 799-SAFE.\n News Arlington Heights Religion Newsletter", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-01T18:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:14:40.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
