The organization's annual Taste of the Arts fundraiser will be held from 6-9 p.m. Nov. 14. It is not only the biggest annual fundraiser for the BCA, it is the only one. \"We receive a 25 percent matching grant from the Illinois Arts Council Agency's Community Arts Access Grant. Part of the commitment in receiving the grant is to match the fund. The money raised each year through this fundraiser goes not only to match the grant, but also to fund the many programs we offer here,\" said BCA Executive Director Kristyne Gilbert Bradford. \"This is our one and only fundraiser. The majority of the rest of the money we receive comes from grants and membership.\" Taste of the Arts is a staple for the Buchanan Center for the Arts, having begun the year of the Buchanan Center's inception. The event is set up in such a way that it appeals to not only art lovers but also all community members interested in aiding the BCA. \"If an arts organization is interested in applying, they can get either stop in here or call to get an application. This is always a fun evening. It is a beautiful dinner. There is music, wine, live and silent auctions and great items up for grabs donated by our sponsors,\" Gilbert Bradford said. \"This event supports arts in our community, but the live and silent auctions have something to appeal to everyone. Local artists donate art, but there are also baskets donated by area businesses; restaurants, hair salons, etc.\" Tickets are $60, and people can either call or stop by the BCA to purchase one. The event will see 120 guests, and right now, there are fewer than two dozen tickets remaining. The theme of this year's fundraiser is \"Great Gatsby,\" and those attending have the option of dressing in period costume. \"We encourage folks to come in costume, but it is not required. It is just a fun option. Over the last couple years, the event has grossed between $15,000 and $17,000 each year,\" Gilbert Bradford said. \"We hope to not only meet but to surpass these figures this year. This fundraiser is absolutely critical to those who depend on us and our programs.\" Adding to the already abundant stress of planning an extravagant \"Gatsby\"-themed fundraiser is the construction currently being undertaken on what will eventually become Pattee Plaza. \"We are always moving forward on the plaza, but somethings do take awhile. Even when there is no activity, we are still making preparations. Right now, we are turning the building's interior wall into an exterior wall, and we must ensure it is structurally sound,\" Gilbert Bradford said. \"It is estimated that this will take two months to accomplish. The buildings are down at least, which is a small victory for us. This will be a huge re-investment in our community, and it will change the entire landscape of the downtown. I hope the new space will be utilized to the fullest extent.\" Page 2 of 2 - Gilbert Bradford estimates the ultimate completion of the project, which would include Pattee Plaza's completion as well, to happen either spring or summer of 2016.
