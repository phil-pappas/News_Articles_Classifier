Ant-Man and the Wasp will open July 6, 2018. \nMarvel didn't specify whether Paul Rudd will reprise his role of Scott Lang/Ant-Man for the follow-up, but it's a safe bet that he will. He will appear in character in next year's Captain America: Civil War . \nEvangeline Lilly played the Wasp in the original Ant-Man , which earned more than 400 million dollars at the worldwide box office earlier this year. Marvel notes the sequel will be its first film named after its heroine. \nIn light of the Ant-Man sequel, Marvel has shifted a few other superhero movie dates. Black Panther , starring Chadwick Boseman, will debut February 16, 2018, and Captain Marvel will hit theaters March 8, 2019. \nFurthermore, three untitled Marvel films are coming in 2020. \nAlso on Thursday, Disney, the parent company of Marvel and ABC News, announced release dates for a couple of animated Pixar sequels, including Cars 3 , which will open June 16, 2017. Toy Story 4 had been scheduled to debut on that date; it will now arrive a year later, on June 15, 2018. \nIn addition, The Incredibles 2 will be released on June 21, 2019. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:59:48.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
