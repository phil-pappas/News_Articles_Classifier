This is one of the Lord’s blessings that had to be called into existence by a member of the body of Christ to be followed by the masses of people to keep the peace that is being known by the world as changing times are here. It is time for the country to get in line with the peace movement on this level of thinking and reacting. This book is like a journey to help end a modern day problem, to help with the reformation of the justice system to help the relations between police and people.\nIf you really want to know of a solution to help with the problem between the police and the people, invest in a possible solution and you will be better off with what may be priceless knowledge that money can’t buy that can help you become more aware. Then who has been chosen to speak for the Lord? Is it you or me or both? It can be an answer to the peace we may be in need of with the problems the police and people are having. It is said by some that it is. But what do you say? Well I guess you will have to read it to know because anyone can say anything but when you know what you know that is good for you and all around you, you want them to know also.” says author Tracy Bush.\nReaders who wish to experience this profound work can purchase “A Peace Offering for the Police and the People” at http://www.boundtoheaven.org or online at Amazon.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708.\nAbout Page Publishing\nPage Publishing is a traditional New York based full-service publishing house that handles all of the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
