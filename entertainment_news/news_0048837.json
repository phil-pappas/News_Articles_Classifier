Tracey Hamlyn Local Real Estate Cars For Sale \nSITTING in a theatre, watching 42nd Street play out on stage, was the moment Michael Robertson and Kara Lane decided performing was going to be their life. \nGrowing up as part of Rockhampton's performing arts and eisteddfod community, the pair knew of each other long before they worked together. \nAs a teenager, Michael watched Kara Lane perform the role of Hope Harcourt in Rockhampton High School's production of Anything Goes. \nIn a few weeks, the pair will be reunited on stage in the same production. \nWhen the SS American sails into the Pilbeam Theatre, Kara and Michael will take to the stage as Reno Sweeny and Billy Crocker in the de-lovely Cole Porter musical. \nBut they're not the only ones reunited for the production. \nKara grew up in the Rockhampton Musical Union Choir hall, with her mother, singing teacher Christine Netherwood, playing many a lead role. \nHer brothers, Dean and Travis Netherwood, are also part of the Anything Goes team on stage and behind the scenes. Anything goes: Musical theatre star Kara Lane arrives home for Rockhampton Musical Union's October production, Anything Goes. \nProduction choreographer Jan Kennedy this year had a helping hand from daughter Liz Perez, who grew up and studied with Kara, while she was home on holiday from America. \nThe show's stage manager, Suzanne Galletly, is the daughter of director Pat McKenna and danced at the same ballet academy as Kara. \nMichael said it had been a pleasure to work with Kara again, both bouncing off each other to bring more to their roles. \n\"One of us makes a mistake and you don't really notice it because we both cover it up,\" Michael said. \n\"I think now we're doing runs of the show it's good ... it's really starting to fall together now. \n\"That's when the magic happens, when all the little bits fall together.\" Michael Robertson and Kara Lane perform an item from Oliver! in the RMU Choir's presentation of Stage Stunners 2012.
