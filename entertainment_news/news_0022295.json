Touted as the first of its kind - in terms of confluence of artistes and number of shows - the Bengaluru Comedy Festival will see the who's who of the comic scene including Daniel Fernandes, Sundeep Rao, Biswa Kalyan Rath, Abish Mathew and Radhika Vaz.\n\"Each one with their own talent and intelligence will ensure that the crowd has variety on their platter,\" says Sumendra Singh, who is the organiser.\nFernandes with his witty dialogues is a hit among the young crowd while Kenneth Sebastian is known to blend music with comedy which makes his shows one-of-a-kind. The icing on the cake is a show by comedy queen Radhika Vaz.\nBut what makes this event different from other comedy shows? \"It is an opportunity for Bengalureans to treat themselves to a bigger, better laugh,\" Singh says. Explaining that it was all due to networking with artistes, Singh says it is an attempt to bring all comics together and reach out to more people.\n\"Credit must go to Daniel Fernandes, who made it happen.\" For two days there will be 18 shows at three stages called Black Wagon, White Wagon and Blue Wagon.\nExpecting a footfall of 10,000 over two days, Singh emphasised on the fact that the shows are a way to spend a fun day family. The fact that most of the show tickets have been sold out is a testimony to people's expectations, says Singh. It's not just stand-up comedy, the audiences will also get to interact with the artistes during The Improv, who will improvise on an impromptu situation, making it a memorable show.\nBengaluru Comedy Festival\nWhere: Amphitheatre, UB City; When: Oct 10 and 11; Tickets: bookmyshow.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T07:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:57:07.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
