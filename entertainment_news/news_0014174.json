Biv, the mnemonic device for the order of colors in the rainbow? Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. I love them all, but I was always intrigued by the magical indigo. You don’t see it in sunrises or sunsets. It’s not in the average ocean waves or clear, blue skies.\nDuke Ellington touched its mystery in “Mood Indigo.” Seeing indigo in nature is always special. You can’t help but exclaim when you spot the first-of-the-season indigo bunting fly from the shadows of a live oak. Or when you see an Eastern indigo snake stretched like a blue seam in a Georgia sand hill.\nPeriodically the Ossabaw Island Foundation hosts indigo dyeing workshops on the island, led by master dyesmith and artist Donna Hardy. Last month I attended a program and learned the long story behind the plant and the color; hands on, hands in, hands wet and hands deep sea-island blue.\nIndigo dye comes from the indigo plant and has been used over four millennia. It’s been found in the tombs of the Pharaohs. It comes up repeatedly in the Bible in the book of Exodus. Marco Polo brought it to Venice from India.\nIt gives blue jeans their deep blue color. It’s in paintings of Renaissance Madonnas. It gives a glory to Mayan and Aztec pottery. And mixed with milk and lime, it became an important Lowcountry color. Haint Blue on shutters and doors protected many Gullah-Geechee homes from unwelcome spirits.\nIndigo was grown on Ossabaw from Central American seed from the 1750s through the 1770s. With the Revolutionary War, cultivation ended and the plants vanished across the South.\nOr so it was thought — not a plant to be found in the U.S. Until 2007, when Ossabaw Island manager Jim Bitler discovered a number of plants growing around the island. Donna Hardy got involved and with Clemson scientists determined that these Ossabaw plants were descendants of the 18th century indigo plantation.\nThey had survived and adapted to become a new perennial variety. Hardy calls them “the first true American indigo.” It’s like a botanical Jurassic Park. She is working now with Clemson agriculture folks to find the best ways to grow and to process this amazing heirloom indigo.\nThe Ossabaw Foundation has transplanted the wild indigo to form a lush bunch of bushes around the old island Clubhouse. At the workshop, we snipped the leafy tops of the plants and turned them over to Hardy to simmer, aerate, pH-adjust, remove oxygen and otherwise do alchemy on gallons of pigment-rich broth.\nAs she worked, she talked about the rich history of indigo and natural pigments, telling tales of haint blue and indigo intrigue. And speaking in poetry about the art of dyeing.\nI made the mistake of describing the froth of bubbling blue at one point in the process as “blue scum.” She quickly told me that in Japan it is called “the flower of the vat.” She skimmed the foam onto a glass dish to dry, crystallize and become a prized artist’s pigment.\nWe all were able to dye several cloths. I went the classic tie-dye route on several T-shirts. Most of the other folks did way more creative stenciled designs on scarves, silk wraps and layered art pieces.\nThey produced patterns that captured the island horizons or the illusion of sand ripples on a beach. Some looked like batik and origami all together. Two of the younger girls dyed their hair.\nWe were all feeling contented, enjoying lunch, our creations hanging on clotheslines to dry and to let the color develop. Then who to our wonder should appear but Sandy West herself. The cherry on top of this sundae, or maybe more the blueberry, given the dominant shade of the day.\nAt 102 years old, Sandy West is still paying it forward. In my book, you may as well say that she bequeathed Ossabaw to the state of Georgia in 1978. Her family had owned it since 1924. When the rising tide of taxes and many generous years of self-funding, the Ossabaw Island and the Genesis Projects prompted her to find a way to leave it pristine for the common good, it became the first Heritage Preserve in the state.\nAnd so it stays, unspoiled and inspiring. Sicilian donkeys still roam free, descendants of those she brought there in a VW minivan more than years ago. The distinctive strain of feral hogs still feast on hickory nuts and acorns and play into displays at Mt. Vernon and Colonial Williamsburg.\nThe Ossabaw Island Foundation ( www.ossabawisland.org ) with DNR maintains the island and runs its many educational and cultural programs.\nMrs. West toured the clotheslines, touching and commenting on our fabrics. She is sharp as a tack. When I suggested that this was the fall Ossabaw collection, she was puzzled at first and asked me to explain.\n“You know, like the Dior or Ralph Lauren collections.”\n“Yes,” she said, “We can have the runway show on the dock.”\nI had done some shirts with Spanish moss and palm berries wrapped tightly within, hoping to attract indigo buntings, but they generally came out just mottled, not the striking patterns I’d envisioned. She said, “Don’t worry. The dappled look goes with everything.”\nWe posed for a group portrait with our deeply dyed hands in an indigo huddle. You can see it on Donna Hardy’s Facebook page, Sea Island Indigo.\nMrs. West knew the timeline. She said that our skin would clear up in a few days, but that it would take four weeks for our nails to grow out. That’s right, almost to the hour. I’ve gotten more comments about my edgy look since the workshop than in my whole life before it.\nI saw lots of Missionaries of Charity, Mother Teresa’s nuns, in Washington last month for the Pope’s visit. My fingernails matched the deep blue, indigo stripes on their saris. I told them all about Ossabaw.\nWho knew that such a rich color could come from a nondescript bushy legume? Who knew that the leaves, when simmering, would smell like butterbeans? Who knew that Sandy West would waltz in?\nAs a young unmarried lady Sandy West danced with Johnny Mercer at the old Desoto Hotel. Had he gotten to know her longer and seen what she was to accomplish, he might have penned an additional verse:\n“You must have been an Ossabaw baby.\nYou must have been an indigo child.”\nBen Goggins, a retired marine biologist, lives on Tybee Island.
