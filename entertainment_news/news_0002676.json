The makers have sourced a special costume from Las Vegas that cost Rs 20 lakh.\n\nTiger Shroff \nSays a source, \"All superheroes are identified by their costumes. We had various meetings to discuss Tiger's look. We initially tried sourcing costumes from designers in India, but that didn't work. So we finally decided to get it made from the studio which fashioned costumes of Spiderman and Superman.\"\nApparently, the production team has appointed a guard to keep vigil outside the costume room. A unit hand says, \"It was difficult to get the perfect ensemble. Remo and Tiger flew to Las Vegas to finalise the outfit. After checking out 11 costumes, they picked one. It's a unique look and the production team has been asked to keep it under wraps until the official release.\"\nRemo confirms the story and says, \"Getting the right superhero costume is as challenging as writing a superhero film. The look has to stand for the superhero's ideals and attitude besides being young and cool.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:05:02.064+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
