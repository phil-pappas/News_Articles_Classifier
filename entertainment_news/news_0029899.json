Comedian James \"Jimmy Mack\" McNair was killed in the crash.\nMorgan made a surprise appearance at the Emmy Awards last month, with a more substantive turn as guest host on Oct. 17 of NBC'S \"Saturday Night Live,\" the show where he was once a cast member. In one sketch, he was joined by his fellow cast members of \"30 Rock,\" Tina Fey, Alec Baldwin, Jane Krakowski and Jack McBrayer.\n\"People are wondering, 'Can he speak? Does he have 100 percent mental capacity?'\" he said in his opening monologue. \"The truth is, I never did. I might even be a few points higher.\"\nMorgan was unavailable for comment about his concert tour, although in a news release he described it as getting back on a bike after falling down - \"you don't forget where the pedals are.\"\nHis bookings, from February until the end of May, include some cold weather gigs: Vermont and Ontario in February. But he does have two dates in Hawaii in early April.\n___\nOnline:\nhttp://www.tracymorgan.net/ \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
