Guillermo Del Toro is not the kind of horror filmmaker to leave monsters unseen behind creaky doors for any length of time.\nHis heroine here is an aspiring young authoress with a taste for the supernatural: she prefers Mary Shelley to Jane Austen. She also prefers literature to men. That is until the dashing Baronet Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) sweeps into her life, seeking her father’s investment in a mining scheme, and soon, Edith’s hand.\nReaders of Victorian literature won’t be surprised when Edith finds herself installed at the Baronet’s gloomy, windswept castle in the north of England, not far, geographically or thematically, from Wuthering Heights.\nTom Hiddleston, left, and Mia Wasikowska in a scene from Crimson Peak. Dead leaves fall into this stately home through a crumbling ceiling. Rotting insects crowd the side tables and livid red clay oozes up from the earth like congealing blood.\nThere’s no mad woman in the attic, but there are more\ng-g-g-ghosts than a Scooby Doo box set.\nOther Stories What’s the Buzz: Saint, sinner, shoosh Nrl 0 comments My lifesaving surgery is killing me Nsw 0 comments Alleged GoPro gang rapist already on bail Nsw Former NRL star ‘dragged woman down stairs’ Nsw ‘Why do sports clubs ignore victims?’ Nsw 0 comments Falconio killer ‘more like a prison guard’ Nsw The Mexican director’s love of all things Gothic is obvious from movies like Pan’s Labyrinth and Hellboy. His new film mines Victorian novels of sensation and suspense, with liberal doses of the Bronte sisters and Daphne du Maurier.\nMia Wasikowska in a scene from Crimson Peak. Jessica Chastain cuts a fine, icy figure as Thomas’s spinster sister, a Mrs Danvers type who expresses her loathing for her brother’s new wife by offering her endless cups of tea.\nCharlie Hunnam, who starred in Del Toro’s Pacific Rim, plays an ophthalmologist who fancies himself a bit of a Sherlock Holmes.\nBut perhaps the true star is the costuming by Kate Hawley, which is gorgeous: a florid expression of all the passions and terrors playing out here.\nThis is not a subtle film. It’s not even unpredictable. But it is an awful lot of ghoulish, melodramatic fun.\nNow showing\nCRIMSON PEAK\nReleased by Universal\nStar rating 4/5\nDirector Guillermo del Toro\nStarring Mia Wasikowska, Tom Hiddleston, Jessica Chastain\nRating MA15+\nRunning time 119 minutes\nVerdict Costume horror piece has thrills, chills and frills", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a75b28370a0ad33daa7c22124a656c72", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/bd2b0570b78c93c3df0eace70e74ca45?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f5d3c5460b8ca5e0ac6bdad36a514511", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/99fcba8ae82c8c3a820d363ee6835cce", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/60e790f3c0b5d1eb2cacff7c5a7be6f5", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/1d522f5e81b5d5eddf22ed4e71c451e8", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/868d3d2aed9acecd16c35a98311d628c?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9791bf946e979a3a7c7ee4fd6a0c1721", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-10-17T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T21:53:40.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
