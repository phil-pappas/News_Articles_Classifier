The Stubblr app for iOS combines geo-location and social components to help fans safely and easily find buyers and sellers of last-minute tickets near their location. The game-changing, mobile-first app is made by fans, for fans. Stubblr was developed by avid sports and live music fans, Co-Founders Steven Rosenberg and Paul Yankowitz. Yankowitz said: \"We were tired of the practices and limitations of online ticketing platforms and having to deal with scalpers. We knew there had to be a better way, and thought we could combine the immediacy and transparency of apps like Uber and Airbnb to create a mobile-first ticketing platform. Our vision for Stubblr is to tear down the barriers established by traditional marketplaces, and create a safe environment that empowers buyers and sellers to transact directly in real-time.\" Users are already embracing the new approach, awarding Stubblr with dozens of 5-star reviews in the App Store. Stubblr Features: * Post ticket requests and deals * Find buyers and sellers around you with geo location * Instantly chat with users to negotiate and transact * Social profiles for verification * Digital payments and buyer ticket validation Device Requirements: * iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch * Requires iOS 7.0 or later * 15.4 MB Pricing and Availability: Stubblr 1.0.1 is Free and available worldwide exclusively through the App Store in the Entertainment category. An Android version to shortly follow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:15:33.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
