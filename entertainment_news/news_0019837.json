Courtesy Temple Grandin has many passions: animal science, autism awareness and encouraging and nurturing all types of minds.The famed author and Colorado State University professor will be the keynote speaker this year for the Laramie County Library Foundation's annual fundraiser, the Booklovers Bash on Oct. 23.A dinner, live auction and a speech from Grandin will be featured in the annual event at Little America Hotel and Resort.\"I don't know when we've had this much excitement for an author,\" the library foundation director Bruce Thomson said.Grandin was diagnosed with autism at 2 years old and didn't begin speaking until she was nearly 4. Although the number of people who are diagnosed with autism has grown in recent years, Grandin attributes that to the widening of the autism spectrum.\"The diagnosis isn't precise,\" she said. \"People get too hung up on the spectrum.\"For Grandin, her early years were difficult because of her limited speech skills. She ended up attending a boarding school in New Hampshire where she was exposed to what would become her life's work: livestock. The boarding school, Hampshire Country School, has a farm where students can get hands-on experience working on a small farm, with various forms of livestock to care for.Grandin went on to spend a good portion of her career working to improve slaughterhouse conditions to reduce stress in the animals, as well as working to design stockyards, corrals and other animal facilities.Her website, www.templegrandin.com , states she has designed the facilities in which half the cattle are handled in the United States.She said in a phone interview she feels children today aren't being exposed to various skill classes, such as welding, and that's hindering what they could become in their later lives.\"We have a shortage of skills,\" she said.She feels kids should be able to \"try on careers,\" which is something she reiterates to her animal science students. Grandin has been a professor with Colorado State since 1990, when she was hired as an assistant professor.Grandin gave a TED Talk in 2010 entitled \"The World Needs All Types of Minds.\" During her speech, Grandin elaborated on how her mind and thoughts work.\"I think in pictures,\" she said during the TED Talk. \"I don't think in language. My mind works like Google images.\"She said that because she thinks visually, that has helped her design livestock facility designs because that allows her to test run a design in her mind.
