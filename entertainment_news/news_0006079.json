Double up on flavor at Jackson Street BBQ 1 / 4 Back to Gallery \nBurgers and barbecue under the same roof are a Houston tradition that goes way, way back, and the new Jackson Street BBQ - the joint project of local celebrity chef Bryan Caswell , partner Bill Floyd and celebrated pitmaster Greg Gatlin - is the latest spot to combine the genres. \nWhen I arrived in Houston in the mid-1960s, Otto's BBQ had already been serving hamburgers out of its little Memorial Drive grocery store since the early 1950s; the adjacent barbecue component of the business came later, in 1963. Other old-line barbecue institutions of the time, such as Guy's Meat Market and Demeris, became known for their burgers as well. \nAnd in the 1970s, there was a flurry of barbecue-on-burger action as local chains like Gabby's and Luther's sprang up. (Luther's was later absorbed by the Pappas BBQ chain, which still serves a respectable burger.) \nIt made a certain sense, although smoking meats and grilling burgers involves very different skill sets, equipment and time considerations. Beef was a common theme, as was gut-busting carnivorousness. The buns used for barbecue sandwiches and burgers were interchangeable. Pickle slices and raw onion had to be prepped for both genres. Both burgers and 'cue were casual meals over which diners did not tend to linger, and they could be dispensed from a walk-through serving line without much fuss. \nSo Caswell's decision to make burgers a key component of his Jackson Street project, parked in the northern shadow of Minute Maid Park, is right in keeping with local foodways. How successful has he been? Let's see. \nOrdering: Go through the cafeteria line and place your order; they'll give you a numbered table flag, and a runner will bring your food to you when it's ready. \nPrice: $8.95 for the house double-double cheeseburger; $2.95 for house-made potato chips. \nArchitecture: Salad stuff on top. On a griddle-toasted bun goes a thin beef patty, a square of American cheese, another thin beef patty and still another square of American cheese. Next come raw red onion, tomato slices and iceberg lettuce. You apply the condiments yourself; they're on a service table of plastic squeeze bottles and hot sauces in the dining room. \nQuality: This is one of those rare and terrific burgers in which the whole far exceeds the sum of its parts. The ingredients aren't fancy or artisanal, but they add up to a classic, delicious expression of the vintage grocery-store-style Texas burger made with thin patties sizzled on a flat-top grill. The bun, while substantial enough to do the job of holding things together, is thin enough not to distort the meat-to-bread ratio. \nYou can, if you wish, snag some pickled jalapeño wheels from the barbecue condiments bin in the cafeteria line. But you absolutely should not miss Jackson Street's house-made Comeback Sauce, the light reddish stuff in the white plastic squeeze bottles. \nOoze rating: Good. \nGrade: A. This burger seems like a new Houston classic. The $8.95 price is a bit steep with no sides, but the flavor and satisfaction levels soar. \nBonus points: There's a range of local beers on tap, including Karbach's Love Street, a blonde Kolsch-style brew that makes a good burger partner. And while some burger aficionados will consider the lack of french fries tragic, the house potato chips are worthy specimens, dusted with sea salt and a sultry spice mix. If you must have something fried with your burger, Caswell's famous squares of fried mac and cheese might do the trick. \nMinus points: Parking can be confusing for a first-time visitor. The lot on the north side of the fire-engine-red restaurant allows diners to key in 90 minutes of free parking (you put the printed receipt on your dash), as long as it's not a ballgame night. Don't try just pulling into an empty slot against the building without getting a receipt from the machine. \n(Jackson Street BBQ: 209 Jackson; open 11 a.m.-7 p.m. Mondays-Saturdays, 11 a.m.-3 p.m. Sundays; jacksonstbbqhouston.com) On The Menu", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:54:54.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
