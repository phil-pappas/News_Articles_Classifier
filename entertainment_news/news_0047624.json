Nathan Dominitz/Savannah Morning News Back | Next Nathan Dominitz/Savannah Morning News\nRincon’s Alexis Mercer, a former All-America softball player at Armstrong State University and current senior, is the recipient of the B.J. Ford Scholarship for this school year.\nBy Nathan Dominitz This fall season is different for Rincon’s Alexis Mercer.\n“It’s weird,” she said.\nThe 22-year-old is not playing softball in the fall for the first time since she was about 8 and joined a 12-and-under team because there wasn’t a local squad for children her age.\nShe grew up playing for her middle school teams and the South Effingham High School Mustangs, whose seasons are in the fall.\nThe past four years, she has worn the uniform of the Armstrong State University Pirates, who compete in the spring but also practice in the fall.\n“I keep myself busy where I don’t have to realize what I’m missing,” Mercers said, “except when I hang out with (current Armstrong players), and they have to go to practice and I’m like, ‘Aw.’”\nMercer saw some of practice Thursday at the Armstrong softball field, where the image of her lunging for the ball from her post at shortstop, as well as other players’ photos, adorn a banner hanging from the bleachers.\nBut those days are over for Mercer, who attends Armstrong as a fifth-year senior scheduled to complete her degree in rehabilitation science in May.\n“Just a student,” Mercer said. “I’m a has-been.”\nShe was being humorous and way too humble. Mercer’s fresh imprint on the Armstrong program included All-America honors as a junior and senior, three times All-Southeast Region, three times a first-team selection as All-Peach Belt Conference and twice PBC Player of the Year.\n“I never even expected to be an All-American,” she said. “I never thought of personal goals, honestly. It was awesome making it to the World Series my sophomore and junior years.”\nMercer hit for average, was adept on the base paths and was a merciless slugger, finishing with a PBC-best 60 career homers which is top-10 in NCAA Division II. Her 26 homers as a junior in 2014 were a school record and fourth-most for a single season in DII history.\nThe 5-foot-10, athletically-built Mercer finds this power display, like her multitude of honors, a bit surprising. She credits Armstrong coach Ted Evans with developing her swing.\n“I was not a power hitter in high school. not at all,” Mercer recalled. “I came here and started hitting home runs. I’m strong. I work out and stuff. I don’t feel like I’m a big ol’ girl to hit so many home runs. I think it’s his technique, the way he teaches.”\nThe student is now a teacher, as Mercer has been a community (non-faculty) coach at her alma mater, South Effingham. She also gives private instruction to young softball players. But her playing days — she dismisses the idea of playing internationally — are over.\n“It’s flown by,” she said. “I can’t believe it. Whenever I think about even playing high school ball, I feel like it was just yesterday. I can’t believe college softball is already over. It’s like, What do I do now?”\nShe has channeled her energies into figure competitions, which are much more feminine than physique and bodybuilding contests for women.\n“I’ve always had a passion for working out,” said Mercer, who won in her debut in August in Charleston, S.C., and would like to earn professional status. “It’s nice to have a goal.”\nFirst, she will graduate from Armstrong, where she planned to study nursing before discovering she literally didn’t have the stomach for it. She has family members in the medical field, so it’s long been an interest.\nPaying for college is another issue which has been partially resolved through Armstrong’s fifth-year scholarship program, which features former athletes such as Mercer working at various Pirates sporting events.\nBirthday gift\nMercer, who moved back home after four years of dormitory life, got a financial boost in August, her birthday month, when she became the third recipient of the annual the B.J. Ford Degree Completion Scholarship.\nNamed for one of Armstrong athletics’ pioneers — Ford was the coach of the inaugural women’s basketball and softball teams — the scholarship is awarded to a female student-athlete with a minimum 2.5 GPA who is in good standing academically and within 32 credit hours of graduating.\n“I think that was the No. 1 goal for B.J. Ford when she was here was to graduate the student-athletes,” Armstrong athletic director Lisa Sweany said. “She wanted to help them when their eligibility was done and didn’t have a scholarship there.”\nCindy Hambrick, who played both sports for Ford in 1977-79, said her former coach made a big difference in people’s lives despite not having a lot to work with in terms of facilities and funding. Hambrick, now a physical therapist in Augusta, serves on the scholarship committee and is the chair of the 2015 Treasure Walk for Women’s Athletics, an Oct. 24 fundraiser on campus for the Ford scholarship.\n“This is an effort for us to give back to what we received in school,” Hambrick said. “It’s a great thing and rewarding to see today’s athletes benefit.”\nMercer called Sweany’s phone call informing her of the scholarship “an awesome surprise” and acknowledges her parents probably were even more excited.\n“It’s a huge blessing for female athletics,” said Mercer, a two-time member of the PBC Presidential Honor Roll who also has had financial assistance from the HOPE Scholarship.\nMercer will head a team of fundraisers at the Treasure Walk after working the event for three years as a softball team member.\n“(Ford) is a real down-to-earth person,” she said. “You can tell she really wants to help. She’s been here, done that, and she wants to give back. That really means a lot to us.”\nNathan Dominitz is a sports reporter for the Savannah Morning News.
