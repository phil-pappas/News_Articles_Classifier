SPECIAL NATHAN DEEN • 912-652-0353 I t was an experience many of them had never felt, and for others it was something they had waited over two years to feel again.\nEveryone knew what it meant. No words needed to be said. Hugs were more appropriate.\nSavannah State quarterback Arshon Spaulding put his right arm around the shoulder of Tigers head coach Earnest Wilson III. With their free hands, Wilson hoisted the game ball toward the jubilant Savannah State home crowd, while Spaulding raised his helmet above his head.\nThe Savannah State Tigers had just won a football game Saturday for the first time in 25 tries, and it represented so much for both player and coach.\nThe last time the Tigers were on the winning end of the scoreboard was Sept. 14, 2013, when they beat Fort Valley State 27-20.\nTheir latest win, 37-27 at home over Florida A&M, was an even bigger deal. The Tigers not only snapped what was the nation’s longest losing streak in the Football Championship Subdivision, 24 games, they beat a conference opponent. SSU had also lost its previous 32 games in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference before knocking off the Rattlers on Saturday in front of 4,679 at T.A. Wright Stadium.\nSpaulding, a Brunswick native and graduate of Glynn Academy who is listed on the roster as an athlete, didn’t anticipate being the leader of this Tiger team before the season, but after starter Tino Smith broke his hand in preseason camp, the coaching staff quickly determined that Spaulding had the best handle on the offense.\n“I thought about him playing quarterback, but we moved him early in his career to receiver,” Wilson said of Spaulding, a junior. “Just to see that young man to get to the point where he played receiver for two years, then come in to play quarterback, and win his first Division I football game, it was big for him.”\nAfter the Tigers lost their second game of the season 52-9 at Akron, Wilson said he shared a few words with Akron defensive coordinator Chuck Amato, the former head coach at North Carolina State. Spaulding was the player who stood out the most to Amato.\n“He said, ‘Play that kid,’” Wilson said. “So I listened to him.”\nAgainst FAMU, Spaulding completed 8 of 12 passes for 83 yards and carried 15 times for 91 yards and a touchdown, which was the first offensive TD for the Tigers since their season opener against Colorado State.\n“When Tino went down, we were like, ‘Dang,’” Spaulding said. “But we couldn’t harp on his injury. We had to move forward. When coach (Wilson) came to me in practice about playing quarterback, I was all for it. As that practice went on, the boys started connecting with me. That felt really good, knowing that I could lean on them. Their brotherhood was really good. I needed that.”\nAfter the victory, Spaulding said his way of thank you through his mother’s home cooking.\nSpaulding’s mother, Tiffany Baggs, was in the stands to witness the win. She gave her son a hug after the game, then quickly dashed over to Arshon’s campus apartment to prepare a feast for any of his teammates — fried chicken, dirty rice with rabbit meat and a side of salad.\n“She’s a great cook,” Arshon Spaulding said. “I’ve got a lot left over, and the boys keep coming every day.”\nIf the win was a confidence booster for Spaulding, it was a reassurance for the head coach. Wilson, who produced a victory just three games into his first season before losing 24 straight. Wilson, who knew he was viewed by the public as just another coach who couldn’t get it done at Savannah State, that he was just another in a line of coaches who couldn’t make it more than three seasons. Wilson, who wasn’t being taken seriously.\n“If I say something, people will forget I’ve worked for people like Joe Paterno, Dennis Green, Kirk Ferentz, Joe Philbin, all those guys, and they act like the stuff I’m saying is falling on deaf ears. That’s been the hard part, but you find that in programs that haven’t been successful.\n“I need to just keep pushing on. With this signature win, people will be able to say, ‘OK, maybe he does have something.’”\nWilson received a long overdue Gatorade bath, and after greeting the fans, he trotted off with his players to the locker room to continue the celebration. Wilson wasn’t timid in front of his players. He danced alongside them as the hit song “Jumpman” by Drake resounded through the small building on the north end of the stadium.\n“It was electrifying,” Spaulding said. “Coach Wilson came into the locker room and started dancing, too. He needs to stop. It was just funny.”\nWilson didn’t leave the field until well past midnight, doing interview after interview and soaking in the scene. He finally got back to his office around 12:30 a.m. and looked at his phone. He had received texts and phone calls from former players and colleagues he hadn’t spoken to in years.\n“I had over 50 text messages and 23 phone calls, all congratulating me,” Wilson said. “By 4 o’clock in the morning, I might have had 75 or 80, even from two guys who left the program from my first year.”\n“Congrats on the win, coach!” read one from an ex-player. “Don’t let them settle for less. Take the MEAC!” (The Tigers are 1-1 in the conference, by the way.)\nPublic praise\nHe’s hearing the same accolades from the community, too.\nA big part of what has gotten Wilson through the past two and a half seasons is his faith. He got up the next morning and attended service at Jonesville Baptist Church near the corner of Montgomery Street and DeRenne Avenue and was greeted with congratulations from every direction.\nOn Tuesday, he ate breakfast at Larry’s Restaurant on Skidaway Road and felt like a community celebrity.\n“Hey coach, great win!” he heard.\nIn giving credit for the win, he would thank God first, and the community second. The Savannah State crowd may have been the real hero on Saturday.\nWilson has pleaded through the media and word of mouth ever since he arrived at the school in 2013 for students and fans to flood T.A. Wright Stadium. He asked them to come out for the Tigers’ home opener against the Rattlers and said a strong home crowd was all his players needed to produce a win.\nGuess what?\n“The crowd was the difference-maker,” Wilson said. “Our players didn’t want to let them down.”\nWhat surprised Wilson the most was the student section, where some of the students had faces and even chests painted in Tiger blue and orange.\n“I think that’s the first thing the students looked at. When the students came in all dressed up or with their shirts off, our side got packed. I think that’s when our guys got jacked up.”\nIt had been 20 years since Wilson had seen that kind of atmosphere at Wright Stadium. He was the special teams coordinator for Alabama A&M in 1995 when the Bulldogs visited a highly ranked Tigers team that played in front of a packed crowd. The Bulldogs pulled the upset with an 11-8 win, but the scene stuck with Wilson. It was one that he wants to recreate in his tenure.\n“We come down here, and this whole place is packed,” he said. “It was just a crazy atmosphere. I know that can come back, and everyone can take a lot of pride in it. I need the community to come in and start helping me to get that back here. This is all about the kids and the community.”", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14793205.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14793207.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14793206.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14793204.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14793207.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14793205.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14793208.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14793204.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14793206.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14793208.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-08T14:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:47:51.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
