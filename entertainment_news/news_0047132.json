The mother of actor Sooraj Pancholi says that artists like him are irreplaceable. \nVeteran music director-singer-lyricist Ravindra Jain, the genius who overcame his blindness to render lilting melodies and soulful tunes in several films including 'Chitchor' and 'Ankhiyon Ke Jharokhon Se', died today of multiple organ failure. He was 71. \nJain passed away at Lilavati Hospital in Mumbai at 4.10 p.m on Friday. He was 71. \nHe was having a kidney problem which had resulted from a urinary infection. He was put on dialysis during the course of treatment. \nZarina, who was part of his evergreen songs like \"Gori Tera Gaon\" in \"Chitchor\", told IANS: \"Ravindra Jain has given some brilliant music. He was a highly respected figure and his songs are being hummed even today, which feels very good. I feel saddened to know that he is no more.\" \n\"He had given very good music in 'Chitchor'. That was the time when I met him. He used to sing it out as he was such a good singer. I feel artists like him can't be replaced and have their own place in the music world,\" she added. \nJain had composed memorable music for numerous popular films such as \"Chor Machaye Shor\", \"Geet Gaata Chal\" and \"Ankhiyon Ke Jharokhon Se\", among others. \nHe had also composed music for devotional albums and television serials. \nJain was in Nagpur for a concert recently where he felt uneasy and was subsequently admitted at Wockhardt Hospital there. He was later shifted to Lilavati Hospital where he was kept on ventilator.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:44:45.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
