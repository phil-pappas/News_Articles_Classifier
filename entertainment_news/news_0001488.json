I'm not overwhelmed, I'm very excited and I can't wait for people to see the movie.\"\nHe added: \"I hate watching myself on screen, but I love playing James Bond.\"\nNew Bond girl, Monica Bellucci, said the premiere was \"very emotional\", adding: \"It's incredible to be here, I'm so touched, it's incredible to be part of this tradition.\"\nAsked about working with Craig, she said: \"Daniel Craig is such a gentleman, not just as James Bond, but in real life.\"\nAnother newcomer in the Bond girl pool, French actress Lea Seydoux, said: \"It's a dream come true.\"\nCommenting on being a Bond girl, she quipped: \"I can't really believe it, but I don't know if I'm a Bond girl, I'm just a blonde girl.\"\nThe movie's main villain, Christoph Waltz, told Edwards: \"You don't get the call, it takes a while, you start talking to people and eventually nobody needs to say yes and nobody needs to say no.\"\nPromoted stories Actor Dave Bautista, another of the movie's baddies, spoke about \"getting hurt\" during filming: \"I didn't get hurt - I got beat up! It was worth it at the end of the day, it was absolutely worth it.\"\nDirector Sam Mendes said: \"I'm very proud and quite nervous, but I'm used to the theatre where things can go wrong. With a movie, everyone is going to give the same performance... so that aspect isn't too nerve-wracking.\n\"I want people to like it, I want people to like it as much as I do. I'm really proud of it, we sweated blood over it for two years. I'm really thrilled and a bit relieved.\"\nTalking about being back on the Bond set, Ralph Fiennes said: \"It's a family operation, that's what it is.\" Asked what fans can expect, he said: \"Great stunts, it's very well crafted, it's brilliantly made.\"\nSherlock star Andrew Scott said: \"It's very exciting... It's absolutely epic, I think people are going to go nuts for it.\"\nNaomie Harris, who plays Moneypenny, said: \"I'm very excited to see the film, I haven't seen it yet, been waiting to see it with my family. This is a premiere unlike any other, it's huge and amazing and it's amazing everyone.\"\nShare article Ben Whishaw, who plays Q, commented on why Bond was such a hit, saying: \"I'm not completely sure I have the answer but I think because everyone has grown up with it, it has this nostalgic thing and you know what you're going to get but it's going to be slightly different every time. It's just very deeply in people's lives.\"\nTalking about his character he said: \"I like his clobber, it's not my favourite part of the thing, but I enjoy that everybody enjoys it. I love the acting bit with Daniel and with Ralph and Rory (Kinnear) and Naomie, and working with Sam Mendes.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-27T01:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:24:42.551+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
