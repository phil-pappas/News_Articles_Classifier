The incident sparked a plea from Rosie on her social media sites to help find her daughter. Days later she was found in New Jersey with Steven Sheerer , ​ a man she met on Tinder with a history of drug-related arrests. ​ ​She was 17 at the time.\n ​Chelsea said after the police found her and brought her back home, her mother immediately sent her to live with a friend. Chelsea, who has since turned 18, successfully petitioned a judge to remove the no-contact order against Sheerer. ​ Chelsea told the ​Daily Mail ​she is now living with ​Sheerer ​and his family, and plans to move to Wisconsin with him to better get to know her biological family.\nMore From Cosmopolitan In the interview , Chelsea also revealed numerous personal details about growing up with Rosie, telling the publication her mother was a different person in the public eye. She also disputed her mother's claim that she was mentally ill and said a lot of people \"struggle\" with what she has.\n\" ​ I find her not genuine a lot of the time,\" she said of her mom. \"When we'd go out, she was a completely different person in public than at home and I had a hard time with that. It's like two different people.\"\nRosie has so far not addressed the specific claims made in the ​Daily Mail article. ​On Wednesday morning, she tweeted a photo of her children and a Quote: from ​ Margaret Wise Brown's The Runaway Bunny.\n“I will grow, I will grow, I will grow.\nI will grow without you. I will feel\nthe sun on my face and I will thrive.” pic.twitter.com/yVvR0iUxpb\n— Rosie (@Rosie) October 7, 2015\n​The Quote: reads \" I will grow, I will grow, I will grow. I will grow without you.
