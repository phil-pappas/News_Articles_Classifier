(Toyota media campaign) \nPT0M43S http://www.canberratimes.com.au/action/externalEmbeddedPlayer?id=d-44m4q 620 349 October 16, 2015 - 9:07AM Autoplay On Off Video feedback Video settings It has taken 30 years but the future is nearly here.\nTime-travelling film Back to the Future is poised for more bells and whistles on October 21, 2015, than the gull-wing doors of the DeLorean mean machine that transported Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and scientist Emmett \"Doc\" Brown (Christopher Lloyd).\nYou could say that time has McFlyed for the actors and zealous fans across the globe who are sharing the love with the hashtag #bttf2015\nBack to the present: Claudia Wells and a replica DeLorean in a Campbellfield warehouse. Photo: Justin McManus \nIn a world away from the intensity of a Hollywood studio, Marty and Doc were reunited with the DeLorean DMC-12 in a Campbellfield warehouse. It certainly looked like them but these life-like characters make you gasp when discovering they were constructed from high-tech silicon and shipped over from Los Angeles.\nAdvertisement The glamorous woman draping herself over the car however was definitely real and she was Claudia Wells, the actor who played Marty's girlfriend, Jennifer Parker. Ms Wells didn't just stumble across the industrial Hume Highway on her hoverboard but set her GPS to see friend Maurice Rinaldi, a photographer who has snapped Hollywood beauties for 23 years. And the occasional stallion: Sylvester Stallone.\nInside the dark warehouse, a smoke machine created an atmosphere that merged a disco with burnouts at Calder Park Raceway and a sci-fi film. Even the car has a backstory. The hotted-up replica is owned by Melbourne hairdresser Braun Mennusko​ and given \"braun\" in German means \"brown\", he calls himself Doc Braun. That's a tribute to the film's Doc Brown.\nIt looks like Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) but it's a high-tech silicone version. Photo: Justin McManus \nMs Wells, in Australia for the first time, gushed with adjectives about the film's premiere in 1985 catching up with 2015. \"It's incredible. I'm profoundly honoured. Profoundly honoured and blessed and excited. These experiences and opportunities I get are mind-boggling. I just feel like I'm a little girl in a castle of happiness.\"\nThe film co-produced by Steven Spielberg in 1985 and directed by Robert Zemeckis grossed $210 million in ticket sales and it was the second film in the trilogy that transported the characters to 2015.\nMs Wells recalls auditioning before Spielberg and the session running for a marathon 2.5 hours. \"We just talked and laughed,\" she said. \"I had such a great time.\" \nBack to the past: youthful-looking Michael J. Fox and Claudia Wells in the film. \nThe on-screen romance between Ms Wells and Michael J. Fox translated into real-life affection. They have kept in touch and last saw each other in July at London's Film and Comic Con. \"It was just beautiful,\" she said. \"It was like no time had gone by. We just kept hugging and kept saying 'Hi, I love you, it's so good to see you'. It was beautiful, really beautiful.\"\nIn addition to marking the film's anniversary, Ms Wells is in Melbourne for the  Australian Movie & Comic Expo  at the Showgrounds on the weekend. She'll sign autographs and find out if any Australian fans have tattoos of her because one American fan has.\nJust as emotional is DeLorean owner Braun Mennusko​ and he's also appearing at the expo to show off the car and share anecdotes with fans. After enduring an unhappy childhood, the film changed his life and taught him a lesson. \"What you do today changes tomorrow,\" he said.\nDeLorean owner Braun Mennusko and Claudia Wells. Photo: Justin McManus \nHe described meeting Ms Wells as a \"once in a lifetime\" opportunity and filmed every aspect of their encounter.\nAfter importing the car from Memphis eight years ago, he converted it into a revhead's dream and it does everything except fly and serve coffee. \nAnd no, he doesn't cruise down Lygon Street in it because it is what you call slightly modified. OK, really modified. It resides in his garage and is brought out for appearances and charity events.\nOn October 21, Ms Wells will be in New York for the \"Back in Time\" gala, one of the events being held  to mark the auspicious date and more are detailed in the websites  Back to the Future and We're Going Back \nLeap into the future with Claudia Wells through her website.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:46:15.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
