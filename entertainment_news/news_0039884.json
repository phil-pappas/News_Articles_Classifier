Dumaplin\nOctober 21, 2015 Good news, Pinoy hallyu enthusiasts: PTV Korean Entertainment Incorporated (PKEI) has announced plans to produce a TV show showcasing both Filipino and Korean actors.\n“We are trying to direct a drama series that includes actors from the Philippines and Korea… hopefully this idea could change the pace,” said the PKEI officials through an interpreter at a recent conference.\nA SCENE From ‘Legendary Doctor’\nThe company is also raring to put up a travel show relevant to Filipinos. “We’ll travel across the Philippines, and look at the famous tourist attractions and visit beautiful places here,” the representatives said.\nPKEI revealed they are set to release five Koreanovelas in the country including the romance-drama “90 Days Of Love” (2006) and the Hallyu historical-drama-action-romance “Jumong” (2006).\nThere’s also the South Korean drama series titled “Legendary Doctor” based on real-life events about a famous Korean doctor named Hur Jun. The lines of the characters will be dubbed in Filipino.\nSet in Joseon (a Korean kingdom which lasted from 1392-1897), it starts from when Hur Jun (played by Jun Kwang-ryul), an illegitimate child of the governor of Pyong Ahn Do (a region in Northern Korea), was working as leader of a smuggling ring. When he got caught, his father arranged for him and his mother (played by Jung Hye-sun) to leave for Kyung Sang Do (a region in Southern Korea). But then his mother fell ill so Hur Jun had to seek the help of a local physician named Yoo Ui-tae (played by Lee Soon-jae). Jun became interested in medicine thereafter and trained under Dr. Yoo, ultimately rising up to become the emperor’s physician.\nPKEI said the scenes were shot on location in a “traditional Korean village” where a lot of Korean movies and TV series were also filmed.\n‘Legendary Doctor’\nAsked how the show differs from “The King’s Doctor” (currently airing on another channel), PKEI officials said “Legendary Doctor” is “traditional.”\nPKEI officials said “Legendary Doctor” will appeal to the Filipino market given the similarities of Filipino and Korean culture in terms of showcasing love for family.\nWhen it aired in Korea (1999-2000), the show copped rating as high as 27 percent.\nThe cast of “Legendary Doctor” includes Jun, Lee, Jung, Hwang Soo-jung as Lady Ye-jin, Kim Byung-se as Yoo Do-ji, Jung Wook as Kim Min-se and Hong Choong-min as Lee Da-hee (Hur Jun’s wife), among many others. The actors might visit the Philippines before the year ends.\n“Legendary Doctor” premieres Nov. 7, 9:15 p.m. on PTV-4 (People’s Television Network). Each episode runs for 30-minutes Saturdays and Sundays. (With report from Jojo P.
