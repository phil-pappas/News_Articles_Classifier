The entire industry, like about 400-500 of us, used to go out on the streets and used to perform and collect money and send it to distressed areas,\" he recalled. \n\"We used to play celebrity matches and it still happens. There are many people who are doing it. We are all not villains; there is a heart in the industry as well,\" he added. \nHowever, Amitabh shared that he has not much talked about his social efforts in public as he does not feel “comfortable” doing so. \n“I deliberately never talked about this, because I don’t feel comfortable talking about whatever work I do. But it’s become very difficult to keep away from such matters because now the information media is so strong that questions keep arising unlike past years,\" he explained. \n“Actually, I’ve been working on this since last eight-nine years. I was visiting some region in certain part of the country and I read in the papers that farmers were committing suicide because they couldn’t pay Rs.5000,\" he added. \nBig B said he collected about \"50 farmers who were on the verge of committing suicide and I paid back their money and saved them\". \n\"It is something I don’t feel comfortable talking about, but yes if there is a question asked to what have you done, then I’m going to defend myself. But if whenever there is any need, I’ll always come forward,\" he added. \n“Aaj Ki Raat Hai Zindagi”, which will be aired on Star Plus starting October 18, will be Amitabh’s fourth TV show after “Kaun Banega Crorepati”, “Bigg Boss 3” and “Yudh”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T15:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T18:34:03.666+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
