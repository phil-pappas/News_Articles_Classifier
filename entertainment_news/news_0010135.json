Graphite and crayon on paper, 18½ by 24 inches. \nColorful sculptures by one artist displayed next to another’s black and white pencil drawings at a local festival last year prompted a joint exhibition. Both artists were intrigued how their works differed so greatly in form, material and content yet side-by-side were an interesting visual juxtaposition with a connection. The sculptor, Andrée Valley, appraised the phenomenon of simultaneously experiencing art of drastic differences together and immediately said, “black, white, and color.” \nValley and the other artist, Elisabeth Karpov, recognized a synergy between them and undertook an exhibit together aptly titled “Black, White, and Color.” Their exhibit opens Monday in the Commons Gallery on the first floor of the Old Education Building on the UW-Madison campus. An opening reception will be held from 5 to 7:30 p.m. Thursday. \nKarpov’s primarily black and white drawings are contemplative. “Line Drawings,” a series included in this exhibit, was generated by her interest in finding out what would happen when she moved a pencil across the paper — an investigation, so to say. Black and white is primarily used because the compositions evoke an emotional state of being. Each finished within one sitting, the series’ pieces final forms feel so full to Karpov that she doesn’t even see lack of color. \nHighly spirited wall sculptures of pure color are Valley’s contribution to the “Black, White, and Color” exhibit. Inspired by music, reflecting the shading, tempo and interweaving of sounds, the basis of her work is perceived chaos and how it is contained within an object. “Shape, color, pattern, piling, stacking, and tangling permit the viewing of one form and pattern through another and reveal ever-changing relationships,” she explained. “Made from aluminum, most of the sculptures are water-jet cut, colored with a baked-on powder-coat finish, bolted together and range in scale from four feet to 18 feet.” \nBoth Karpov and Valley live in Madison. Karpov is a studio artist with a primary interest in the study of form — both human and objects. She has also exhibited paintings and sculptures. Valley teaches at Madison Area Technical College. Pieces of her work in other mediums — paper, ceramics and computer designs — have been in major shows and collections, and published in print. \n— Robyn Norton", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:08:26.745+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
