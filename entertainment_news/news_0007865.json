Columbia Records, CBS Records, Sony Records Show Caption Previous Next \nLONG BRANCH, N.J. (AP) -- The Jersey shore home where Bruce Springsteen wrote the album \"Born to Run\" is back on the market. \nThe two-bedroom cottage at 7 Â½ West End Court in Long Branch is owned by three fans of the singer. They bought it in 2009 with the idea of turning the home into a tribute to the New Jersey rock legend, but those plans were derailed. \nSpringsteen has said that he wrote every song on the \"Born to Run\" album - including the title track and other classic songs such as \"Thunder Road\" and \"Jungleland\" - while living in the home from 1974 to 1975. \nThe house does occasionally draw visitors, and the current owners say they try to accommodate the fans. \nThe home's list price is $299,000.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T23:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:28:47.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
