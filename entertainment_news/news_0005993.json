By Bill Blankenship bill.blankenship@cjonline.com \nFestivalgoers filled the streets of both of Topeka’s downtowns Oct. 10 as they partied in the afternoon at the fourth annual Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) Street Fair on North Kansas Avenue and spent the evening dining and jamming to music at the inaugural Capital City Jazz and Food Truck Festival on South Kansas Avenue. \nWhile the NOTO Arts District has remained a popular destination for street festivals, such as its portion of the monthly citywide First Friday Artwalks, two years of traffic-diverting street reconstruction and sidewalk renovation have rerouted parades and limited some activities on South Kansas Avenue in downtown Topeka. \nHowever, with the remodeling closer to completion, Topeka Mayor Larry Wolgast told the estimated 5,000 gathered to hear the New Orleans trombone trio-led, rock-oriented band Bonerama to expect more fair and festivals in downtown Topeka on a monthly, sometimes weekly, basis. Vince Frye, president and chief executive officer of Downtown Topeka Inc., agreed, saying the renovated South Kansas Avenue, with its pocket parks, will make downtown a go-to site for Topekans and visitors to the city. \nWhile organizers of the Dia de los Muertos Street Fair feared the Capital City Jazz and Food Truck Festival might dampen attendance, turnout was larger than expected at both festivals. Many attended both events. That was evidenced by those people who were bobbing their heads to Bonerama's music with their faces still decorated for Day of the Dead. \nThe two festivals also had to compete against home football games at Washburn University, Kansas State University and the University of Kansas. And they weren’t the only events going on Saturday, but those other activities also drew well, such as Saints Peter and Paul Antiochian Orthodox Christian Church’s 10th annual Greek Food Festival, which sold all the food it prepared for the annual fundraiser. \nBill Blankenship can be reached at (785) 295-1284 or bill.blankenship@cjonline.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T01:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T01:28:27.443+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
