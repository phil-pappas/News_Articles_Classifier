Image 10 of 10 Burger Friday: Jackson Street BBQ earns an \"A\" and label of \"Houston classic\" 1 / 10 Back to Gallery \nBurgers and barbecue under the same roof are a Houston tradition that goes way, way back, and the new Jackson Street BBQ — the joint project of local celebrity chef Bryan Caswell, partner Bill Floyd and celebrated pitmaster Greg Gatlin —is the latest spot to combine the genres. \nWhen I arrived in Houston in the mid 1960s, Otto's BBQ had already been serving hamburgers out of their little Memorial Drive grocery store since the early 1950s; the adjacent barbecue component of their business came later, in 1963. Other old-line barbecue institutions of the time, such as Guy's Meat Market and Demeris, became known for their burgers as well. \nAnd in the 1970s, there was a flurry of barbecue-on-burger action as local chains like Gabby's and Luther's sprang up. (Luther's was later absorbed by the Pappas BBQ chain, which still serves a very respectable burger and killer French fries.) \nIt made a certain sense, although smoking meats and grilling burgers involves very different skill sets, equipment and time considerations. Beef was a common theme, as was gut-busting carnivorousness. The buns used for barbecue sandwiches and burgers were interchangeable. Pickle slices and raw onion had to be prepped for both genres. Both burgers and 'cue were casual meals over which diners did not tend to linger, and they could be dispensed from a walk-through serving line without much fuss. \nSo Caswell's decision to make burgers a key component of his Jackson Street project, parked in the northern shadow of Minute Maid Park, is right in keeping with local foodways. How successful has he been in producing a burger that can compete with the barbecued meats he and Gatlin are offering? Let's see. \nORDERING: Go through the cafeteria line and place your order; they'll give you a numbered table flag and a runner will bring your food to you when it's ready. There are so many options to consider, from sides to draft beers to a couple of dessert sweets and little extras like deviled eggs, that your first visit can seem a bit disorienting, especially when the downtown lunch crowds are powering through and the cafeteria line is in high gear. By your second visit, you'll know where the tea is dispensed, where the condiments are, and it will all make sense. \nPRICE: $8.95 for the house double-double cheeseburger; $2.95 for house-made potato chips. \nARCHITECTURE: Salad stuff on top. On a griddle-toasted bun goes a thin beef patty, a square of American cheese, another thin beef patty and still another square of American cheese. Next come nested rings of raw red onion; tomato slices, and stacked leaves of iceberg lettuce. You apply the condiments yourself; they're on a service table of plastic squeeze bottles and hot sauces in the dining room. \nQUALITY: This is one of those rare and terrific burgers in which the whole far exceeds than the sum of its parts. The ingredients aren't fancy or artisanal, but they add up to a classic, delicious expression of the vintage grocery-store-style Texas burger made with thin patties sizzled (but not over-sizzled) on a flat-top grill. There is just enough grease and drippage to make eating this sandwich fun, and the bun, while substantial enough to do the job of holding things together, is thin enough not to distort the meat-to-bread ratio. \nYou can add mustard, mayo, ketchup or bottled hot sauce from the condiments table. You can, if you wish, snag some pickled jalapeño wheels from the barbecue condiments bin on the cafeteria line. But you absolutely should not miss Jackson Street's house-made Comeback Sauce, the light reddish stuff in the white plastic squeeze bottles that let you see what's inside them. I used only Comeback Sauce on my burger, and the dance of heat and tart tempered with a tinge of sweetness made the sandwich come alive. \nMy compliments to the grill man. It's easy to cook thin patties into dry oblivion. These had plenty of juice and give to them, while offering that extra portion of griddle sear that makes double-double fans happy. Perfectly sized and melted cheese squares, too. \nOOZE RATING: Good. \nGRADE: A. This burger seems like a new Houston classic. The $8.95 price is a bit steep with no sides, but the flavor and satisfaction levels soar. \nBONUS POINTS: There's a range of local beers on tap, right now including Karbach's Love Street, a blonde Kolsch-style brew that makes a good burger partner. And while some burger aficionados will consider the lack of French fries tragic, the house potato chips are worthy specimens, dusted with sea salt and a sultry spice mix. If you must have something fried with your burger, Caswell's famous squares of fried mac and cheese might do the trick. \nMINUS POINTS: See above; no French fries. Additionally, parking can be confusing for a first-time visitor. The lot on the north side of the fire-engine-red restaurant allows diners to key in 90 minutes of free parking (you put the printed receipt on your dash), as long as it's not a ballgame night. Don't try just pulling into an empty slot against the building without getting a receipt from the machine, like I did on my first visit. And note that the lot directly to the south side of the restaurant is pay-only. \nLOCAL COLOR: This huge, no-fuss acreage (7000 square feet!) is akin to eating in a big metal hangar, lined with corrugated galvanized siding and rimmed with the blue-toned light of flat-screen televisions and beer neon. It's not pretty or handsome and it doesn't strive to be: the setup is all about moving people in and out at an efficient clip. Plenty of downtown workers, both white and blue collar, have already made Jackson Street a lunch staple. Zydeco and blues on the sound system makes the room feel more welcoming; so does a friendly and helpful staff. Not to mention that crucial Comeback Sauce. I believe I will.
