Have you ever heard of any other director who has made it big by wanting to be like another director?” When a student retorted that Rajamouli had, in his earlier interviews, mentioned the name of a certain director, Rajamouli said, “I admire him and his work but I did not want to be like him.” \nMost students were interested in knowing how many parts he would take if he were to direct the Mahabharata. Rajamouli said he would require a minimum of four parts over of six years.Would he then direct the film? Rajamouli replied, “When I decided to make Baahubali, Prabhas and I believed in it. He trusted me so much that he was willing to give me three years. Now, if for Baahubali, I need an actor to give me three years, imagine making a film on the scale of Mahabharata. Practically speaking, how many actors will be able to give six years of their time to a director?” Asking the students to be true to themselves, the director said, “If you want to be a director, first you must enjoy telling stories. That is the first test.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T11:38:54.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
