We will always be supportive of one another. We are, and always will be, a family.”\nRumours first sparked that Miller’s marriage was on the rocks when she was spotted out and about with Myer model Kris Smith, however after Confidential made calls to her representatives, we were told the pair were just be friends.\nOther Stories Daylight savings starts Sunday Nsw Boyd: The father I wish I’d had Nrl What’s the Buzz: Saint, Sinner, Shoosh Nrl 0 comments Bieber Island an expensive flop for Seven Sydney Confidential 0 comments Shocked mum slams ‘Toey Joey’ National Rowe’s crap housewife skills put to test Sydney Confidential 0 comments", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/cd755904259f219f9f03f37588e3a7d1", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/4586b5d31da28a13c8f0d5d0d0e8ed18", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0b3b0504f7b896aafbc583f2c7d80217", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a32238c55f0819e988ff6f0fe0631e89", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f6f4e67ce499794be0262f7638a62bb1", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9f612afd371a92f7f0889222cfeec35b"], "published": "2015-10-02T10:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T22:25:43.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
