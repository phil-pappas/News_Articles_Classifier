They were looking for slaves to toil in Spanish mines and mills. \nBut the indigenous peoples of the region proved a bigger challenge than expected, frustrating early Spanish attempts to colonize the region. \nThat’s just one of the topics of Arcadia Mill’s annual Beaches to Woodland Tour lecture series, “Secrets of Santa Rosa Archeology & History in Your Own Backyard.” The lectures are set for 11 a.m. on the first four Saturdays in October. The lectures are free. \n“This year's lecture series covers a wide variety of topics, including failed Spanish conquests, terrestrial archaeology at Arcadia Mill, maritime archaeology at Baypoint Mill and the Killian wreck on the Blackwater River,” said Arcadia Mill site manager Adrianne Sams. \nThis year’s lectures include: \n• Oct. 3 : Erin Stone, an assistant professor with the University of West Florida History Department, presented, “The Ghosts of Narvaez, De Soto, and De Luna: Indigenous Peoples and the Failed Conquests of Santa Rosa in the 16th Century.” She spoke about the how Spanish sought to enslave the natives and how the natives worked against them. \n• Oct. 10 : Katherine Sims, UWF archaeology graduate student, will present. “Home is Where the Artifacts Are: A Preliminary Analysis from the 2015 Arcadia Field School Season.” This lecture will highlight the findings from an exploration of the site of a former home at Arcadia Mill, including a possible chimney foundation, brick pier features and cultural material associated with the home. \n• Oct. 17 : Zack Cruze, UWF archaeology graduate student, will present, “From Jake's Point to Baypoint: Investigations of a 19th Century Lumber Mill.” This lecture focuses on the impact Italian ancestry played upon the structural design, location and operations of a lumber mill located along the Blackwater River. \n• Oct. 24 : Chris Dvorscak, UWF archaeology graduate student, will present, “The Killian: A New Discovery on the Blackwater.” The lecture will discuss the discovery, unique site area, mapping and recording strategies that a privateering ship in the Revolutionary period played in the economy of Milton during the time it existed and sank, as well as what all this means for the history of Milton and the Blackwater. \nBuilt along Pond Creek, Arcadia Mill was the largest water-powered industrial complex in Northwest Florida in the first half of the 1800s. It now functions as an historical site. Arcadia is owned by the University of West Florida and managed by the UWF Historic Trust. \nArcadia included two sawmills, a textile mill and one of the first railroads in territorial Florida. Arcadia's industry ceased in 1855. \nThis is the sixth year for the lecture series. Sams said about 200 people attended the lectures last year, the most ever. \n“We definitely see familiar faces for both special events as well as regular visitation,” she said. “We have quite a few repeat visitors who enjoy the outdoor facilities. “ \nIn addition to the beauty and history of the mill site itself, visitors to this year’s lecture series will see a number of improvements to the facility. \n“Since last year's lecture series, we completed a large-scale construction project consisting of a new bridge over Pond Creek and an associated boardwalk,” Sams said. “The new ADA-compliant bridge and boardwalk provide safety and accessibility, so that everyone can enjoy Arcadia's outdoor facilities.” \nArcadia disappeared into the forest until local historian Warren Weekes drummed up awareness of the site. The Santa Rosa Historical Society purchased Arcadia in 1987 and granted the property to UWF in 2004. \n“Arcadia Mill is truly a unique destination that strives to serve the community as an educational facility for our rich historical past,” Sams said. “We hope that our guests will learn something new that they can share with others.” \nContributed content provided by the Beaches to Woodlands Tour. \nWant to go? \n• WHAT : Secrets of Santa Rosa: Archaeology and History in Your Backyard. \n• WHERE : Arcadia Mill, 5709 Mill Pond Lane, Milton. \n• WHEN : 11 a.m. Saturdays through Oct. 24. \n• COST : Free. 15 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.pnj.com/1Lg8c7J More Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T23:55:03.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
