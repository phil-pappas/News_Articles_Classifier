The rock band, fronted by Adam Levine , reportedly has been receiving calls from the National Football League to play during halftime of Super Bowl 50 taking place next year. According to E! News, Maroon 5 had \"extensive talks\" about filling the coveted performer spot. Although the NFL also considered Bruno Mars and Coldplay , sources told the site that Levine and his band are the front-runner. No comment yet from both Maroon 5 and NFL. Mars performed at 2014's Super Bowl XLVIII, bringing in 115 million viewers. There were reports that he was invited back to \"curate\" the performance with multiple talents but the plan could be ditched. Performing for last year's game, Katy Perry drew the highest viewership for the halftime special with 121 million. Super Bowl 50 will take place at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California and aired live by CBS on Sunday, February 7, 2016. The NFL ditches the Roman numerals due to concerns over using a sole \"L\" for the 50th Super Bowl logo. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:51:53.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
