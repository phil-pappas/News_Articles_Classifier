If you are not fit, that will affect your work somewhere...you can't play all characters then. When I say fit, I do not mean six abs...I mean fitness in a healthy way,\" Irrfan said in a group interview, while promoting 'Jazbaa' here.\nThe actor, who will also be seen in the international movie \"Inferno\" which will be directed by Ron Howard and will star veteran Hollywood actor Tom Hanks, adds that just making abs does not define being fit.\n\"Just making six pack abs is not healthy...that is an internal power. Fitness along with mental fitness is also important. An actor's thought, intelligence, spirituality, voice senses and his body are their instruments, and whatever is not fit among this....that will affect the work of the artist,\" he said.\nIrrfan is currently waiting for the release of Sanjay Gupta's directorial on Friday. The film also features veteran actress Shabana Azmi and Jackie Shroff among others.\n'Jazbaa', which is a Hindi remake of South Korean movie \"Seven Days\", is produced by Essel Vision, White Feather Films and Viking Entertainment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:01:49.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
