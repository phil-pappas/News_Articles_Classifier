After landing, these impairments can make it difficult for crew members to begin necessary operations, such as walking from their landing craft to their habitat.\nAt the conclusion of the bed rest study, subjects were asked to perform the FTT. Researchers found FTT functions that involved postural stability were the most difficult for participants.\nThese results help us understand that astronauts, without countermeasures or balance training, may have difficulty maintaining balance control when landing on Mars, which has 62 per cent lower gravity than Earth.\nThe team is studying a countermeasure approach for balance control problems after landing.\nThe countermeasures are done preflight and during flight, and the goal of this training is to help “train the brain to become more adaptable,” Bloomberg said.\nReadapting to gravity after many months of space travel and being weightless is not easy for astronauts. By using the preflight and inflight training tools in development by Bloomberg and his team, crew members on a mission to Mars may transition back to gravity smoothly and land their spacecraft safely on the surface.\nFirst Published on October 01, 2015 9:40 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:26:53.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
