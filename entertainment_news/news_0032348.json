On Wednesday, October 21, Yakovenko tweeted the image of Kumar Patel (Penn) wearing a turban and long beard on board a plane. He captioned the picture, \"U.S. threatens to stop helping Iraq against ISIL if Baghdad asks Russia for help. The terrorists must be rejoicing.\" US threatens to stop helping Iraq against ISIL if Baghdad asks Russia for help.

He wrote, \"The Russian Federation ambassador to the UK tweeted this Harold & Kumar pic with seriousness. I can't stop laughing.\" The Russian Embassy's officials made quick attempt to fix the mistake. Their official account said, \"It is rather hard to spot an actual terrorist laughing. Your performance is convincing and therefore fit to illustrate the idea.\" However, Penn refused to stop there. He tweeted an image of Russian fighter Ivan Drago, who was portrayed by Dolph Lundgren in \"Rocky IV\", and wrote, \"@Amb_Yakovenko thank you, Mr. Ambassador.\" — Kal Penn (@kalpenn) October 21, 2015 \n© AceShowbiz.com Browse Kal Penn Pictures More Kal Penn News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:45:27.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
