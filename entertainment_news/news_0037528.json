Image caption Grimmy faced having only five boys or bringing one back \nIt's been a chaotic week of X Factor coming and goings. \nMason previously made rude comments about Simon Cowell, Cheryl Fernandez-Fersini and has been booed by the crowd. \nGrimshaw announced Mason's comeback on his breakfast show saying: \"It had to be Mason, he's going to judge's houses. I just thought he was exciting.\" \n\"People do kick off, but if he kicked off and he wasn't talented then he'd be out the door, but he can really sing,\" he explained. \n\"He's got an idea of who he wants to be and that's good for me. Let's focus on the music,\" he says. \nSome argue it's the latest sign producers are trying to improve X Factor's falling ratings. \nBut Nick Grimshaw will now be taking the maximum number of six boys on to the judge's houses stage. \nTom Bleasby's departure came a week after he appeared on Ellen DeGeneres's US chat show to talk about his virtual duet with Jessie J. \nHe used a karaoke app to make it look like he was singing with Jessie. \nThe YouTube clip has been watched more than 11 million times since it was posted in May. \nEllen surprised Tom on her show by bringing on Jessie as he began to sing Flashlight. \nFollow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter, BBCNewsbeat on Instagram, Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube and you can now follow BBC_Newsbeat on Snapchat Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T12:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T13:20:34.189+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
