We were on a side street and everyone would drive to us and make an effort to see us. The whole front of the house was lighted up and there was fog. It was fun.” \nAnd popular. Styer soon turned it into a fundraiser for nearby Terre Hill Park and moved the trail to the park, where it has been going strong since 2000. \n(They missed 2010 and 2011 because Styer got married and decided to take some time off.) \nThis year, the hauntings will be held Saturday from 7 to 10 p.m. \nThe Haunted Trail has been getting bigger and bigger through the years. \n“There were maybe 100 people the first year and over 700 people came last year,” Styer says. “We have over 100 volunteers, including 60 live actors along the trail.” \nHe rates the show a PG-13 experience. \n“We try and make sure it is family appropriate,” he says. “But it is scary: The guy with the chainsaw, some gory stuff and body parts. But we keep it to a minimum. We see a lot of families here.” \nStyer notes that parents often call him to see if they can bring their kids. \n“They’ll ask, can I bring my 5-year-old, or my 10-year-old. I tell them I can’t answer that, that it depends on the kid,” Styer says. “We don’t have any restrictions — it’s at your own discretion.” \nStyer enjoys creating new ways to scare people. \n“I am an audio visual technician so doing the lighting and the sound is my thing,” he says. “I am the techie who finds an excuse to come out with toys. A lot of the lighting is LED, which is fun and we can do a lot of different things with it. And we have 15 independent sound systems running throughout the trail. We want to make it as professional as possible.” \nAnd that gets a bit easier every year. \n“Having technology evolve means things become cheaper and we can use different resources,” he says. “A lot of the props and scenery are donated or pulled out of dumpsters. We build a theme around them.” \nThis year’s theme is time travel and will offer some spooky Twilight Zone moments. \n“We’ve got a lot of new special effects this year, it looks good,” Styer says. \nAt the pavilion, where you get your tickets ($5 each), you can buy glow sticks and other holiday-related items. Then you walk down the trail a bit and watch a magician do a show before you head on to the main trail. \n“The trail is actually on the fitness trail down through the park,” Styer explains. “Then you go into the open picnic area and down through the woods and on to the other side of the park. It’s pretty secluded. After the trail, you take a hayride back.” \nStyer says this year features some terrific costumes and makeup and more electronic scare tactics. +2 \nSo what is the scariest thing on the trail? \nWhat it’s always been: Clowns. \n“They always seem to show up,” Styer says. \nFinding volunteers is never too hard. \n“I’ve discovered that people really like to scare other people,” Styer says with a laugh. “We provide the chance and they show up.” +2 \nWhat: Terre Hill Haunted Trail \nWhen: Saturday, 7 to 10 p.m. (rain date Oct. 31) \nWhere: Terre Hill Community Memorial Park, 210 Lancaster Ave., Terre Hill \nCost: $5", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:03:52.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
