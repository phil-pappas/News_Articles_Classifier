The Coeur d'Alene Tribe, which operates the resort, also must pay a $25,000 fine.\n\"Dancers with the show 'Hunks' created the problem, not with nudity but apparently with dance moves the Idaho liquor control board considers excessive,\" casino spokesman Bob Bostwick told The Spokesman-Review.\nBostwick said the dance group broke a state law that bans performers from simulating sex acts. The tribe in September agreed with the Idaho State Police Alcohol Beverage Control Division to the license suspension and fine.\n\"The dance group violated their contract, which stipulated that they would keep the show within the bounds under Idaho liquor laws,\" Bostwick said. \"Still, it is the seller who is penalized.\"\nCarl Disonell, booking agent and owner of the eight-man show, said the group does 250 performances a year around the country. He was surprised the January event in northern Idaho resulted in the casino's liquor license being suspended.\n\"It's a normal show,\" he said. \"What people don't understand is it's really up for interpretation. If a guy pops his hips one time — 'Oh, that's a sex act.'\"\nHe said Idaho was the only place the show caused problems for a venue.\n\"It's like we're in the 1940s,\" he said. \"It sounds to me like (inspectors) went there looking to fine the casino.\"\nIdaho State Police spokeswoman Teresa Baker said there was no full nudity, but performers pushed the boundary too far and violated state law by showing too much buttocks.\nAs for simulated sex acts, she said, \"anything is a matter of interpretation, but if you look at the statute it is clear.\"\nThe show is billed as the country's \"hottest\" all male revue with choreographed production numbers that include acrobatics, costume changes and vocal performances.\n\"The guys are good-looking and fit, and they are extremely personable,\" Disonell said.\nBostwick said the hotel-casino has served alcohol for about 20 years and has never before had a problem with its liquor license.\n\"We are always careful to ensure our guests are of legal age, and our staff is trained to monitor consumption,\" Bostwick said.\nThe suspension lasts from Nov. 1 through Nov. 10. During that time, guests must keep alcoholic beverages in their hotel rooms. \"We will simply make the best of this temporary suspension,\" Bostwick said.\nIn a separate case in June, state officials penalized three Lewiston bars with a $10,000 fine and 15-day liquor license suspension against their parent company, Weber Inc.\nIn that case, two undercover officers acted as patrons at an event advertised as the \"Ultimate Males Las Vegas Style Strip Show,\" according to police documents. The officers reported witnessing activities that are prohibited at establishments licensed to sell beer, wine or alcohol.\n___\nInformation from: The Spokesman-Review, http://www.spokesman.com\nSociety & Culture", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:53:04.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
