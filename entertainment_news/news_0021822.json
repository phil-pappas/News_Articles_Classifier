Based on moviegoers’ reaction seeing them together in scenes shot in Central Park, Times Square, etc., they make a lovely pair if fate steps in.\nJennylyn and Sam in ‘The Prenup’\nIsn’t that also up to Sam, we asked. He turned red. We suggested that they guest on each other’s album for recording soon. The two said if it were just up to them, they’d do it in a heartbeat. At the very least, Sam said they plan to work out together.\nProduced by Regal Entertainment and currently in theaters, “The Prenup” is a feel-good movie about two people who fell in love abroad only to have their families bicker over their planned wedding. When a prenup between the two was laid on the table, love and loyalties are put to the test.\n“The Prenup” is Jennylyn’s first movie after winning Best Actress for “English Only, Please.” The movie is Sam’s first in a long while since he devoted some time studying acting in the US. This is their first movie together.\nAlso in the cast are Melai Cantiveros, Ella Cruz, Dominic Ochoa, Jaclyn Jose, Gardo Versoza, Freddie Webb and Neil Coleta. “The Prenup” is directed by Jun Robles Lana.
