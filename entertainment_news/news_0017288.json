The former host of 'The View' is \"heartbroken\" after learning what Chelsea had to say about her in a bombshell interview.\n\n\nRosie O'Donnell \n\"It's heartbreaking on every level,\" Rosie's rep said. Chelsea gave the lengthy interview to a British newspaper and held nothing back about what it was like living with Rosie as a child.\n\"I find her not genuine a lot of the time. When we'd go out, she was a completely different person in public than at home and I had a hard time with that. It's like two different people,\" the 18-year-old said.\nThen there was a question of Rosie reporting Chelsea missing in August. She was eventually with a man whom she reportedly met online. While the comedian claimed that her adopted daughter ran away, the latter told the newspaper that she was actually kicked out of the house.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:57:39.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
