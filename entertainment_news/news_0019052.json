Photo: Supplied \nFICTION \nFURIOUSLY HAPPY\nBy Jenny Lawson. Picador.  $29.99. \nIf you are a person who thinks that psychiatry is a con job that has been pulled on society, then this book will confirm that opinion. The author has been told by various shrinks (her word) that she is \"a high-functioning depressive with severe anxiety disorder, moderate clinical depression, and mild self-harm issues that stem from an impulse control disorder\". She also suffers from rheumatoid arthritis and has autoimmune issues.\nShe has several other disorders that are to be found in the DSM , the bible of the con job mentioned above. The DSM is an American creation; the middle letter stands for \"statistical\" which is the publication's way of assuming respectability for itself by associating its dubious academy with a perfectly reputable branch of mathematics. \nAdvertisement All those problems have not seriously affected Lawson's ability to write prose that is funny, maddening and sometimes intensely personal. It appears that much of the material is from her blog, which may explain why it is disjointed and mostly inconsequential. There are lots of lists and short comments, some quite funny, the kind of thing that might be composed by a bright year 9during a Friday afternoon maths class. \"If the plural of 'octopus' is 'octopi', why isn't the plural of rabbit 'rabbi'? Is it just because 'octopuses' is too much fun to say?\" \nShe has a husband called Victor, who can be expected to be proposed for sainthood at some time. They have arguments, some resulting from his wife's replication of the behaviour of a wayward six-year-old. And there is her daughter Hailey, who is picked on at school; her mother's reaction is to tell the bullies to study her (the author) carefully, because she is what they will be in the future: \"And look how fat you got!\" We are not told whether it works.\nThen there are the cats of which she seems to have a plural number, one she calls The President, opening an opportunity for more fun. There is an excellent chapter where she recounts a visit to Australia that included time in the outback near Uluru. I smiled at her throwaway line about Darling Harbour: \"I don't like a place that randomly gives itself a compliment.\" \n\nBecause this is written for an American readership, there are multiple uses of the word \"asshole\" and \"motherf", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:28:02.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
