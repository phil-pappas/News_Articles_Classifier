Representatives for the pair have not yet announced their son’s name, however. Brooklyn Decker and her husband Andy Roddick, who have just welcomed their first child, pictured in May 2015 \nThe couple, who have been married since 2009, announced the news that they were expecting a baby back in May. At the time, the 28 year old star of What to Expect When You’re Expecting revealed her condition via an Instagram picture of her cradling her baby bump. She wrote: “So this happened… #the3ofus”, and ever since she’s been keeping fans abreast of her condition with a series of selfies. \nAt the same time, 33 year old Roddick was asked by People about what thought they had given to baby names, but they were as tight-lipped then as they are now, also saying that they intended to keep the sex of the baby a secret until it was born. “The name is still debatable… We’re open to any and all suggestions. We’re going to figure it out as we go.” \nLast year, Decker had confessed that she was excited to start a family, having been married for five years, now that her husband, a former world number one, had quit professional tennis after an injury-plagued end to his career. \n“He’s just the most clever person I’ve ever met,” she gushed last year. “He has such a quick mind… He’s so clever, and his humour is very snarky. It always makes me laugh.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:37:53.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
