He is, hands down, the greatest player in the game right now. ... He's proven that by winning and leading the Hawks to three Stanley Cups and winning a couple of gold medals for Canada. I always enjoy throwing on the TV and watching the Blackhawks' success.\"\nFleury also has been monitoring the situation involving Patrick Kane, who is under investigation for alleged sexual assault in Hamburg, N.Y. As an author and motivational speaker who battled alcohol and drug addiction throughout a 15-season NHL career, Fleury said he would welcome an opportunity to counsel Kane if the Hawks winger sought it.\n\"If Patrick Kane needs somebody to talk to, I would be more than happy to be that guy because I've been through it all,\" Fleury said. \"I hope he has the support and the people around him that can help him get through this difficult time in his life.\"\nWith Kane's situation ongoing, Fleury stressed that \"instead of judging, we should think compassionately. Hopefully Patrick is getting the help he needs. Hopefully the girl that … made the accusation is getting the help that she needs so that they can get past this and go on to have healthy, happy, productive lives.\n\"When I was going through what I was going through, it was a lonely, dark place. Now finding the support and love and all those things I was missing from my childhood is what it's really all about and coming through on the other side. Those stories of recovering and overcoming are really important to society in that we're human beings, we all makes mistakes — especially when we're young. We have to look at it in the bigger picture as opposed to individually and what is the hot topic at the time.\"\nPrivacy Policy Copyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Chicago Blackhawks Patrick Kane NHL", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562d78bf/turbine/ct-side-theo-fleury-blackhawks-spt-1026-20151025"], "published": "2015-10-26T03:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T15:15:22.053+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
