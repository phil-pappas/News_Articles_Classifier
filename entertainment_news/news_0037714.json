Absher, a retired teacher, family-man, devoted writer and author, has completed his new book “Koot: A Novel”: a gripping and potent tale that delves into the ideas of ancestry, history and values. Published by New York City-based Page Publishing, Terrence K. Absher’s poignant tale is a historic account of the original people of Nevada.\n“In the area of Wadsworth Nevada, the first people used skins of rabbits and duck feathers for articles of clothing. They moved with the seasons to gather food. The greatest family pride I was permitted to view was a baby's blanket made from feathers of a black mud buck. I changed the spelling to \"Koot.\" The leading male character in my book was wrapped in a Koot blanket when he was delivered to the uncles. Now you know how the story starts,” said author Terrence K. Absher.\nReaders who wish to experience this significant work can purchase “Koot: A Novel” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708.\nAbout Page Publishing\nPage Publishing is a traditional New York based full-service publishing house that handles all of the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
