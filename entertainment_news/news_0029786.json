I'd rather break this glass and slash my wrists,\" he told Time Out. \"I'm over it at the moment. We're done. All I want to do is move on.\"\nWhether Craig was finally exhausted by the intense eight-month shoot, or the painful knee surgery he underwent during filming, \"Spectre\" looks likely to be his fourth and last Bond film.\nAnd with the end of an era looming and a bloated budget reportedly exceeding $300 million , expectations for the film among fans are bigger than ever.\nI don't think I've ever been as excited as I am for the new James bond #SPECTRE #JamesBond\n‚Äî Clinton Chisholm (@clintonlewisc) October 22, 2015 Words can't describe how excited I am for Spectre @007 üòç\n‚Äî abbie (@_abbiemillar) October 22, 2015 Some lucky critics got to see the film last night before the rest of us.\nRead More So what did they make of it?\nRave reviews\nUnsurprisingly for a film already pulling in a 90% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes , the critical response to \"Spectre\" has been overwhelmingly positive.\nOver to the critics:\nPeter Bradshaw, The Guardian : \"Bond is back and Daniel Craig is back in a terrifically exciting, spectacular, almost operatically delirious 007 adventure -- endorsing intelligence work as old-fashioned derring-do and incidentally taking a stoutly pro-Snowden line against the creepy voyeur surveillance that undermines the rights of a free individual.\"\nReally, really liked #Spectre , great mix of old and new. Incredible opening sequence. Only disappoints in its femmes. Better than Skyfall.\n‚Äî Ben Travis (@BenSTravis) October 21, 2015 Robbie Collin, The Telegraph : \"Five stars: It's a swaggering show of confidence from returning director Sam Mendes and his brilliant cinematographer ... The film's color palette is so full of mouth-watering chocolates, coffees and creams that when the story moves to Rome, the city looks like a $300 million, fascist tiramisu.\"\nKim Newman, Empire : \"If this is to be Craig's last bow as 007 (the credits at least promise James Bond will return), he'll be remembered as the man who brought Ian Fleming's grit back to one of the great British film franchises.\"\nIt's good, mind. Weird but good. Easily best since Casino Royal, and Lea Seydoux is great. #SPECTRE\n‚Äî Oli Franklin-Wallis (@olifranklin) October 21, 2015 Kate Muir, The Times : \"This fourth outing for Daniel Craig as James Bond is achingly cool, as sleek and powerful as the silver Aston Martin DB10 that races through the movie.\"\nOf course, the film was not perfect\nThere were detractors:\nGuy Lodge, Variety : \"What's missing is the unexpected emotional urgency of 'Skyfall,' as the film sustains its predecessor's nostalgia kick with a less sentimental bent.\"\n1st Spectre screening! Classic Bond, spectacular if formulaic, gadgets, and much funnier than expected. Leans heavily on the past #Spectre\n‚Äî Nina Nannar (@NinaNannarITV) October 21, 2015 Olly Richards, NME : \"'Spectre' is, mostly, operatic, in scale, emotion and frequently in choral soundtrack. The thing with opera, though, is that while in its most powerful moments it can shake an audience in their seats, it does have a propensity to go on a bit.\"\nThumbs down from some\nAnd some reviewers did not enjoy themselves at all.\nStephen Dalton, The Hollywood Reporter : \"(T)he final hour disappoints, with too many off-the-peg plot twists and too many characters conforming to type. While its commercial prospects seem bulletproof, 'Spectre' ultimately feels like a lesser film than Skyfall, falling back on cliche and convention.\"\nWendy Ide, The Wrap : \"The thrills here are empty. 'Spectre' is a frustratingly unsatisfying experience.\"\nSPECTRE: Quantum Of Solace 2: This Time It's Personal. Bad action, lousy plotting, Lea Seydoux only redeeming feature.\n‚Äî olilyttelton (@olilyttelton) October 21, 2015 The reviews seemed to reflect a split between critics on either side of the Atlantic, with many British reviewers gushing over the film, and a number of American viewers less enthused -- perhaps unsurprisingly for such an unashamedly British franchise.\nRegardless, a film with this many 5-star reviews has got to be worth a watch for even the most tepid of Bond fans, whatever their nationality.\nOne thing for certain: Craig has had enough of high-budget tuxedo action, at least for now, and will soon be taking a break from the big screen altogether. It has been announced he will move on from his best -known hero role to play the villainous Iago in an off-Broadway production of \"Othello.\"\n'Spectre' to Shakespeare: Daniel Craig will join David Oyelowo in Off Broadway \"Othello\" http://t.co/xp92E8qHjw pic.twitter.com/Dfof4L8hT3\n‚Äî Michael Paulson (@MichaelPaulson) October 19, 2015", "external_links": ["http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/21/spectre-review-james-bond-is-back-stylish-camp-and-sexily-pro-snowden", "https://twitter.com/BenSTravis/status/656945259910463488", "http://www.nme.com/reviews/various-artists/16306", "https://twitter.com/clintonlewisc/status/657133901916340224", "https://www.thewrap.com/spectre-review-007-james-bond-daniel-craig-christoph-waltz/", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/spectre-film-review-833833", "http://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/spectre-review-1201622685/", "http://t.co/Dfof4L8hT3", "http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=138905", "https://twitter.com/NinaNannarITV/status/656938593433296896", "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/james-bond-spectre/review/", "http://t.co/xp92E8qHjw", "https://twitter.com/_abbiemillar/status/657132856095961088", "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spectre_2015/", "https://twitter.com/MichaelPaulson/status/656101044724899841", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/SPECTRE?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/olilyttelton/status/656934296259842049", "https://twitter.com/olifranklin/status/656934449792290817", "https://twitter.com/007", "http://www.timeout.com/london/film/daniel-craig-interview-my-advice-to-the-next-james-bond-dont-be-shit", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Spectre?src=hash", "http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/film/article4592879.ece", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/JamesBond?src=hash"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:44:58.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
