While Samoa are already eliminated from the tournament, they won't want to finish one of the tournament's poorest groups with just one win, while Scotland have yet to confirm their qualification. The Scots will need a win with Japan breathing down their neck for second spot.\n4.30pm: Pool A: Australia vs Wales\nKick-Off: 4.45pm\nStadium: Twickenham\nBy far the day's biggest game, with both sides set to battle it out for top spot in Pool A, and quarter-final tie with either Scotland or Japan. The losers will face South Africa come the knock-out stages, so there's a lot riding on the result of this, and if both sides turn up like they did against England, we could be on for a barnstormer.\n7.30pm: Pool A: England vs Uruguay\nKick-Off: 8.00pm\nStadium: Eithad Stadium\nWith England already eliminated from the tournament, they travel to Manchester to take on minnows Uruguay in their final group game. The sides have only ever met once in their history, back in 2003 when England racked up a 111-13 score, but even a result in similar fashion won't make up for the side's failings against Wales and Australia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T00:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:05:47.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
