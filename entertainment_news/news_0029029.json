Wanting to add dynamism into the trophy Mr Lill decided to make it kinetic, so it would be able balance on its own. \nIf nudged, the trophy doesn’t topple, but rather sways side to side, and then balances itself out, as seen in the video below. \nSilicone bronze was chosen as the material, as it’s a well known marine material, that is both workable and durable. \nMr Lill says: “Being chosen to design the Louis Vuitton America’s Cup World Series Trophy is a real honour and has been a big challenge for me. \n“We managed to produced a self-balancing, interactive, silicone bronze trophy, based on the very simple concept of perfect balance. It leans over 32 degrees, which is Bermuda’s latitude on the globe.” \nThe counterweight inside the trophy was created by experimenting with melting lead from various local sources – the keel weight from a Bermuda International One Design, a Bermuda fisherman’s downrigger ball and a reclaimed sash weight from an old Bermuda cottage. \nProducing it was a five-week process of prototyping, engineering, testing, milling, filing, welding, sanding, polishing, finishing, wood working and waxing. The finished piece weighs just over 10 pounds and leans over at exactly 32 degrees, which is the latitude of Bermuda on the globe. \nThe trophy production was made possible by working with the following local craftsmen and companies: Woodworker Vibio Festa, Machinist Alex Roque, of Dynamic Machining, Metal workers Robert and Max Moniz, of Bermuda Electroplating, Fishermen Jim and Blake West, who melted the lead counter weight inside, Engineer Bill Andrews, Craig and Donna Faries of Mass Ltd, Marine Engineer Stuart Lunn, of Lunn Marine, Sculpter Desmond Fountain and David Swift, of Pembroke Paint.
