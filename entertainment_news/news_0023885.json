He'll be at Side Street Studio Arts, 15 Ziegler Court, where he'll sign autographs from 8:30 to 9:30 p.m. At 9:45 p.m., Svengoolie will serve as master of ceremonies at the event's costume contest.\nLast year's contest winners were a couple dressed as Pat Sajak and Vanna White.\nThere also will be a new area this year called Cirque de Freak, the contents of which have not been fully disclosed.\n\"We haven't given out details because we want people to be surprised,\" she said.\nKeselica said anyone 17 years old or younger must be accompanied by an adult to enter.\n\"Many of our bars will be selling alcohol in the streets,\" she said. \"It's definitely geared to an adult crowd.\"\nWhile organizers are busy ensuring that music, cabaret and burlesque acts, a battle of the bands, a costume contest and the creepiest of characters are ready to roll, city officials also are working out the financial logistics.\nLast year, the net cost of the festival to the city was $34,000.\nThis year, said Keselica, the city is aiming to cut that loss down to zero.\nAdmission prices will increase to $12 in advance and $15 at the door. Last year, tickets were priced at $7 in advance and $10 at the door.\n\"Our goal this year is to try to break even,\" she said.\nThe event's Facebook page indicates more than 17,000 people intend to be part of the Nightmare experience this year.\n\"Last year, we had 12,500,\" Keselica said. She said crowds have increased each year; the first year drew 3,500 attendees.\nWhile the festival will take up the same \"footprint\" in the downtown area, covering six full city blocks, as it has in the past, Keselica said the city has budgeted $160,000 for expenses, up from last year's expenditure of $134,293.\nWith a larger crowd, additional funds are needed to cover more police personnel needed for increased security, she said. Additional public works workers also will be pressed into service.\nLabor costs are a significant part of the equation, Keselica said.\n\"Last year, it was 33 percent of the budget,\" she said. \"It might be little bit more (this year).\"\nKeselica said there have been no arrests during any previous incarnations of Nightmare on Chicago Street.\n\"In the last four years, we've had the event and we haven't had any issues,\" she said.\nDespite the fact the event has been spared nasty weather thus far, the city is wary of the impact a major storm could have on the event and the city's budgetary bottom line.\n\"This year, the city purchased weather insurance,\" Keselica said. She said the exact terms of the insurance are still being negotiated.\nVendor prices are also going up. There will be a total of 22 vendors this year. While vendors who participated in years past will be charged $50, new vendors will pay $75 to participate, Keselica said.\nKeselica said city officials met with business owners in September to discuss the event and its relative benefit to downtown businesses.\n\"We're bringing all the people to the door fronts of their businesses,\" she said. \"It's their job to bring them in.\"\nFor details or to purchase tickets, visit www.nightmareonchicagostreet.com\n News Festivals/Fairs Night Life Elgin South Elgin Music", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/events/951218551612001/", "https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-20T23:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:38:31.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
