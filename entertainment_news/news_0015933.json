It’s like a Japanese love song.”\nHe said the song features unique violin techniques of high and low notes that add color to the sound, with Nykter utilizing the bow in unusual ways. On the piano, he said the scales and chords are not something heard in Western music.\nOther songs include pieces from the Czech Republic, Estonia and will conclude with a romantic selection by German composer Richard Strauss.\nWoven throughout the performance, Kenyon said he will talk to the audience and discuss the songs and the locations where the music originated.\nThe duo has been performing together for five years and join up when they can synchronize their busy schedules.\n“We don’t do what most people consider a classical music concert,” Kenyon said.\nUpcoming Classics at The Merc concerts include the Quartet Nouveau on Nov. 22.\nContact the writer: sschulte@pe.com , 951-368-9457", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwlbux-b88545632z.120151021145918000gc2cn6l5.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwlbuy-b88545632z.120151021145918000g73cn58f.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwlbux-b88545632z.120151021145918000gc2cn6l5.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwlbuy-b88545632z.120151021145918000g73cn58f.10.jpg", "http://www.temeculatheater.org/"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:11:24.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
