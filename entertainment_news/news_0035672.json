They want him to do what his brother Stavros has done - find a good Greek wife and produce some grandchildren.\nBut Alex's life takes a different direction when he meets Eve, a Muslim lawyer played by Andrea Demetriades.\nJust as it was for Adam and Eve, their romance is troubled.\nHis parents (Tony Nikolakopoulos and Zoe Carides) are vocal about their distrust of Muslims. And her parents (Helen Chebatte and Simon Elrahi) are lining up an arranged marriage to a Muslim man in Lebanon.\nLykos knows these cross-cultural clashes are a touchy subject for a comedy.\n\"When I first wrote it, I had warnings from extended family saying 'you've got to be careful because the Muslims are going to get upset and they could do something',\" he says.\n\"But we staged it [from 2006 to 2013] and we've never had a complaint from a Lebanese Muslim person. We've had two complaints and they were both from Greeks.\"\nBoth those objections were about the way Alex's overbearing Greek father was portrayed.\nLykos says one of the most satisfying things about Alex and Eve has been the social cohesion in the theatre audience.\n\"You've got rows and rows of Greeks and Muslims sitting side by side. We're talking about tattoo clad guys with their wives just cacking themselves laughing and high fiving and carrying on.\"\nAs a Greek-Australian, he made sure there were an equal number of jokes about both sides of the romance.\n\"When you say 'Islam' or 'Muslim', there's already an implied drama there. People react.\n\"Playing drama on what already is  dramatic, I thought would have been very uninteresting. So I thought I'd go opposite and have fun with it. I think that's what's really helped to make it work.\"\nBut the success of the play was far from certain early on.\nLykos, a former tennis professional who turned to the theatre in his late 20s, says the second stage performance in 2006 had to be scrapped for lack of interest.\nThere were 10 actors on stage, with Lykos playing Alex, but they sold just four or five tickets.\n\"We cancelled the show,\" he says. \"I thought 'what have we done?'\"\nBut over the next fortnight, word of mouth built audiences to the point where Alex and Eve became a hit and was able to expand to bigger theatres.\nLykos played Alex through each of the stage versions with various actresses as Eve, including Amber Gokken, Catherine Jermanus, Zoe Ventoura and Nisrine Amine.\nHe would have liked to return to the role in the film but instead plays Stavros, Alex's brother.\n\"I definitely wanted to play the role in the film but I've gotten a bit older,\" he says. \"I'm 40 so it was more of a pipedream than anything else.\"\nWhile Lykos hopes the film will entertain audiences, he is not sure it will change perceptions of Muslim Australians.\n\"Christianity and Islam have been fighting for centuries,\" he says. \"I don't think a little movie is going to have any impact. But, if it does, great.\"\nAlex and Eve is out now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:27:35.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
