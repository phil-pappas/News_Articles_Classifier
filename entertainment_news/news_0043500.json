Today, she's shared the video for \"Hello\", the first track on the album. The video, directed by Xavier Dolan, takes place in the countryside of Montreal and features Tristan Wilds (The Wire, The Secret Life of Bees). Watch it below.\n\"It was a privilege to direct the music video for Adele's beautiful, heartbreaking song,\" Dolan said in a statement. \"When I first heard it, all the images were already running by so clearly in my head - and her trust and generosity allowed me to create freely. Being on set with her was wonderful. And the thought of directing her in the 'acting' aspect of the term was exciting. I discovered that she's a very talented actress -no matter what she'll tell you.\"\nAdele also had her first interview about the track and her album on Zane Lowe's Beats 1 radio show. Listen to a preview of the interview below, in which Adele tells Lowe 25 will likely be the last time she names a record after her age.\n25 is out November 20 via XL Recordings.
