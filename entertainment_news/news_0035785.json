To that end, we respectfully request privacy from the media during this time.\" \nThe stars wed in 2002 and welcomed their first son, Kingston, in 2006. Zuma was born in 2008 and their third boy, Apollo, arrived in February, 2014. \nIn 2004, it emerged that Gavin had previously fathered a daughter, model Daisy Lowe, with Powder star Pearl Lowe.
