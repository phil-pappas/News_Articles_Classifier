I have to call the murderers the murderers.\"Those comments drew an emphatic response from Patrick Lynch, union leader of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association.\"It's no surprise that someone who makes a living glorifying crime and violence is a cop-hater, too,\" he told the New York Post .\"The police officers that Quentin Tarantino calls 'murderers' aren't living in one of his depraved big-screen fantasies - they're risking and sometimes sacrificing their lives to protect communities from real crime and mayhem. \"New Yorkers need to send a message to this purveyor of degeneracy that he has no business coming to our city to peddle his slanderous 'Cop Fiction'.\" \n© Vivien Killilea/Getty Images for SiriusXM Tarantino and protest organisers were also criticised for holding the event just days after New York cop Randolph Holder was shot and killed in Harlem last week.The filmmaker responded to those protests by calling the timing of the event \"unfortunate\", while defending its purpose.Tarantino also recently fired back at those offended by the racial content of his work , insisting that he doesn't have to justify his point of view to anyone.His latest film The Hateful Eight will open on Christmas Day in the US and January 8 in the UK.
