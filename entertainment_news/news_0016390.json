In Washington, D.C., for example, the price of a full-service funeral can range from $3,770 to $13,800, the study found. Chicago wasn't among the 10 markets.\n\"The Federal Trade Commission should update antiquated disclosure rules developed in the pre-Internet 1980s,\" Josh Slocum, Funeral Consumers Alliance executive director, said in a statement.\nAccording to the FTC's website, funeral directors must give you price information on the telephone if you ask for it. \"You don't have to give them your name, address or telephone number first,\" the FTC said. \"Although they are not required to do so, many funeral homes mail their price lists, and some post them online.\"\nThe FTC's website also says you have the right to get a written, itemized price list when you visit a funeral home. The price list is yours to keep, should list all the items and services the home offers, and the cost of each one.\nYou also have the right to see a written casket price list before you see the caskets, the FTC website says.\nSlocum of the Funeral Consumers Alliance, however, said the FTC should \"require funeral homes to disclose prices clearly and completely on their websites.\"\n\"This disclosure will greatly increase consumer search for price information,\" he said.\nbyerak@tribpub.com\nTwitter @beckyyerak\n Business", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5625439e/turbine/ct-funeral-service-costs-1019-biz-20151019"], "published": "2015-10-19T22:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:33:19.112+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
