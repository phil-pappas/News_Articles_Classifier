I want to do more television. My experience of 24 was unbelievable... I don't think there's a better medium than television out there at the moment. So I think I want to do more of it and look for projects where I can repeat my experience. \n\"You have to take your time though to find something like it - and that means you have to work less. So I'll be waiting for something that's worth it, with the potential for the kind of audience access that 24 had.\" \nHowever, Kiefer admits he may still make a guest appearance in the revamped show, adding that he has not \"ruled out a cameo\". \n24 premiered in 2001 and became a huge international success, winning 20 Emmy Awards over the years. \nIt racked up eight full seasons, as well as 2008 TV movie 24: Redemption and the shortened 24: Live Another Day series.
