Posted today at 12:30pm \nABC/Byron Cohen (NEW YORK) -- On Thursday's episode of Scandal , the Senate committee voted to impeach President Fitzgerald Grant. A spokesperson explained to the press their intentions. \"We are seeking the truth,\" they said after getting a unanimous vote, including one from Fitz's estranged wife and first lady Mellie Grant, who is also the junior senator from Virginia. \nStill, when the investigation got under way, Mellie again got the short end of the stick and was asked to recuse herself from the investigation. \"You have to step aside,\" they told her, as she was a conflict of interest. \nAcross town, Olivia Pope finally hired her own fixer -- Leo Bergen. He suggested that instead of being painted as \"America's whore,\" she do a sit-down interview and say that she just couldn't help but fall in love with Fitz. Liv hated that idea but Leo reminded her, \"That's what you'd be telling me if you were me.\" \nLeo also told her to turn to an old lover to vouch for her. So of course she went to her ex-fiance, Edison. Still, it wasn't a warm welcome. \"You're gonna admit to my face that you had no intention of marrying me,\" he told her while sporting his own wedding ring. Olivia apologized and Edison went on television defending his old love. \nBack at the White House, the press found out that Fitz gave Olivia a ring, his great-grandmother's heirloom, which forced her to do the sit-down that Leo wanted her to do. And when asked what she regretted about the affair, Liv said, \"I wish I never laid eyes on him...my friends and family were dragged into the spotlight.\" The interview was a home run for Olivia, who now had the public back on her side. \nStill, the investigation uncovered one of the president's secrets -- the tape of the incident in West Angola in which Olivia was kidnapped and could take down the entire White House. The only person who could save them was Fitz's old chief of staff Cyrus Beene. So Fitz called Cyrus to hand him his job back. After making up and proving to each other that they had much more than a working relationship but a friendship, Cyrus took the job but under certain conditions: new carpet, a presidential pardon, his old job and to fire current chief of staff Elizabeth Norton. Welcome back Cy! \nScandal returns Thursday at 9 p.m. Eastern on ABC. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
