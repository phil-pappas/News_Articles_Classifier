It was listed on Amazon for about $130.\nOn his official Twitter account, Springsteen enticed his fans with the promise of 11 previously unreleased “rarities,” including an early release of the song “Meet Me in the City.”\nNo ‘Truth’ ads on CBS\nCBS has refused to run advertising for “Truth,” the film starring Cate Blanchett and Robert Redford that revisits a painful episode in the network’s past involving a discredited 2004 news story on former President George W. Bush ’s military service record.\nCBS has denounced the movie, set to open Friday, as a disservice to the public and journalists.\nRedford plays Dan Rather in “Truth,” with Blanchett as producer Mary Mapes . Together, they were behind a “60 Minutes II” story that questioned Bush’s Vietnam War-era commitment to service in the Texas Air National Guard. But CBS apologized for the story after documents used were called into question and could not be verified. Mapes and three news executives were fired.\nSony Pictures Classics sought a multimillion-dollar ad buy to promote the film on Stephen Colbert ’s “Late Show,” the “CBS Evening News,” “CBS This Morning” and “60 Minutes,” but was turned down.\n“It’s astounding how little truth there is in ‘Truth,’ ” said Gil Schwartz , longtime chief spokesman for CBS and a character in the movie. “There are, in fact, too many distortions, evasions and baseless conspiracy theories to enumerate them all. The film tries to turn gross errors of journalism and judgment into acts of heroism and martyrdom.”\n“Truth” is told from the points of view of Mapes and Rather, who left CBS News on bitter terms in 2006. They have always contended that despite the discredited documents, the underlying story about Bush was true.\nPerformance Network needs money\nAnn Arbor’s Performance Network Theatre, which suspended operations and shook up its staff last year as a result of financial difficulties, is experiencing a new round of money problems.\n“Due to immediate cash flow constraints, we are sadly in danger of closing,” says a letter sent this week to friends and supporters of the theater by executive director John Manfredi and artistic director Suzi Regan . “This is not a flag we want to wave. Yet, wave it we must.”\nManfredi and Regan say that donations to the theater are down by two-thirds this year and that they need to raise $50,000 over the next 45 days. Cultural institutions, they note, are rarely able to survive on ticket revenue alone. Fans and friends can make donations at www.pntheatre.org/donate or by calling 734-663-0681.\nPerformance Network recently launched its 2015-16 season with a lauded production of Edward Albee ’s “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” You can read the Free Press review at freep.com.\nWeeknd, ‘Uptown Funk’ nominated\nThe Weeknd and the duo behind “Uptown Funk,” Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars , are tied for five nominations each at the Soul Train Awards this year on Nov. 6.\nAll three share nominations for video of the year, song of the year and the Ashford & Simpson Songwriter’s Award. The Weeknd also is nominated for best R&B/soul male artist and album of the year. And Ronson and Mars are nominated for best dance performance and best collaboration.\nBeyoncé , Chris Brown , Jidenna and Tyrese have four nominations each. The show will air on Centric and BET on Nov. 29.\nLil Dicky gets a bargain\nIn Lil Dicky ’s latest rap video, he rides around in a luxury sports car, prances through a mansion and parties on a yacht with bikini-clad women. Athletes and A-list celebrities make cameos.\nBut Dicky filmed all those flashy scenes without spending a dime. The video “$ave Dat Money” garnered a million views within 17 hours after being posted on YouTube in mid-September.\nDicky said the cost-cutting strategy saved him $30,000. His only major expenses were feeding his two-man camera crew and editors for the video. It took them six 12-hour days to create.\nDicky opens the video by asking seemingly random residents in a posh neighborhood if he and his crew can use their home to film. Most of the mansion owners say no, but one woman lets Dicky and his crew in.\nSarah Silverman , Kevin Durant , Mark Cuban , Tom Petty , T-Pain and Hannibal Burress all make an appearance.\n“$ave Dat Money” features Fetty Wap and Rich Homie Quan and was the first single on Dicky’s debut album “Professional Rapper,” which topped Billboard’s Rap Chart in late July.\nCompiled by Holly Hanson from Free Press news services.", "external_links": ["http://www.pntheatre.org/donate"], "published": "2015-10-17T07:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T13:21:34.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
