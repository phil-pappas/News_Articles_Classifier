(Photo: Owen Cooban/ British Ministry of Defence, EPA) \nThe troops who dealt with the delicate task of disarming tens of thousands of unexploded bombs during WWII, and later in conflicts in Northern Ireland, Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan, saved thousands of lives, according to Kensington Palace. And many lost their own lives in the process. EOD Bomb Disposal has been integrally involved in many conflicts, from Northern Ireland to Afghanistan, since #WW2 pic.twitter.com/1QNoEJPcLd — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) October 22, 2015 \nHarry, who served 10 years in the British Army, piloted attack helicopters as Capt. Harry Wales and served two tours in Afghanistan, attended the service in a suit pinned with his service medals. \nAfterwards, he met with families of EOD soldiers killed in action as well as wounded warriors who have suffered life-changing injuries in service. \nPrince Harry talks to veterans who lost their legs in Afghanistan in 2010, at a service marking the 75th anniversary of Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), on Oct 22, 2015. (Photo: WPA Pool, Getty Images) \nAs fifth in line to the throne, Harry has become a full-time working royal, who has made military and wounded-vet charities among his top philanthropic priorities. \nNext month, as patron of the Walk of Britain by wounded warriors, he will welcome walkers at Buckingham Palace for the conclusion of the 1,000-mile trek that began Aug. 22 in Scotland. Harry himself participated in the walk two times in the last month.

I'm glad to see Prince Harry's beard lives on to cheer me up on this depressing morning. \nThe beard \"provoked a storm of approval,\" reported the Daily Mail in September, detailing how Harry's hair had been voted the \"sexiest in the world\" among other celebs (George Clooney, David Beckham) by a London hair-transplant clinic. \nNaturally, Harry's beard has its own Twitter page — actually two. — Prince Harrys Beard (@HRHHarrysBeard) October 22, 2015 \nHarry is due to spend a day in Washington, D.C., at the end of the month to help organize his Invictus Games for wounded warriors, taking place in Florida next year.
