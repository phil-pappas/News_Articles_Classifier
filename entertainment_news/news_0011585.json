With no other contextual info given. In the \" Wherefore \" tab of the site, Corgan asks that if people share his images of people and their cars, to please link back to his site. So let's commence with the sharing. First I must pose the question: Is this some manner of art shit?\nCan you spot the car?\nNope. Nope. Can't seem to find the car.\nDefinitely a plane.\nH . What can be learned from this? Maybe a clue can be found in the tab labeled \" Stuff ?\" Nope, there's just a few links to completely random things to purchase from the site like tea, and a keychain.\nIs this website the first episode of the new X-Files season? I'm confused.
