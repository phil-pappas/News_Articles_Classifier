I had been brought up with babies, kind of working class background and helping with babies. I rushed across to her, she'd got her legs open...she knew me in Z Cars, I said 'breathe deeply' and gradually I got the baby out, the head ... \n\"So the afterbirth came out, and the clots, I pressed her belly and got rid of the clots, and the afterbirth came out. Then I bit it loose and tied it into a knot, etcetera and then I just called for help and eventually an ambulance came. I was covered in blood, my shirt was covered in blood, I was wrapping and wiping her saying 'it's all right darling,' and I was licking the baby's face.\" \nBlessed's interviewer, Libby Purves, was stunned: \"Brian, am I believing this?\" \nHe said the story was \"absolutely true. I've just never talked about it. But what I'm saying is it was natural. You would tell her to breathe deeply and push, push, push, because I'd seen my mother do all this. I was always kept in the background, because all the neighbours were kind of midwives.\" \nA male midwife, Mark Harris, who was also on the show, cast doubt on the story: \"I have never in twenty years of experience noticed anyone doing that.\" \nHe said biting a newborn baby's umbilical cord and licking its face are \"not necessary or recommended. I can't imagine it would harm the baby or its mother, but it is not something would recommend.\" \n- NZ Herald", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:21:09.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
