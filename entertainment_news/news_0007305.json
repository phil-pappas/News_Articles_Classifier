He's like a more nervy, twitchy Chris Addison in The Thick of It. #TheApprentice \n— andy marczak (@andymarczak) October 14, 2015 Poor Oliver Reeder getting fired in #TheApprentice week1….oh sorry, I mean Dan! It began to blur with TheThickOfIt. Sorry @mrchrisaddison \n— Emma Thompson (@Pommity) October 14, 2015 Dan will go back to his sideline of being a Chris Addison impersonator in his spare time. #TheApprentice \n— Dave Jones (@WelshGasDoc) October 14, 2015 Dan looks like someone has deflated and then re-inflated @mrchrisaddison #TheApprentice \n— Josh T (@TannerJay) October 14, 2015 #TheApprentice also Dan looks weirdly like Ed Norton. Is this some weird method prep for a new project? \n— Simon Berry (@SimoncBerry) October 14, 2015 \nMr Bean \n— Kate Lawler (@katelawler) October 14, 2015 Dan is the most hilarious #TheApprentice candidate ever. It is actually Mr Bean combined with the suicidal ginger fella from Full Monty. \n— Jack Thorpe (@TMitC) October 14, 2015 \n(Plus Will from The Inbetweeners) Dan reminds me of Mr Bean crossed with Will from The Inbetweeners #bbcapprentice #TheApprentice #bbc \nPaul McCartney Ah well. Dan might get offered the role of Paul McCartney in a low budget biopic. #TheApprentice \n— Darryl Wilks (@dgwilks) October 14, 2015 Dan looks like a young Paul McCartney #TheApprentice \nA lone voice for JD in Scrubs Dan reminds me of when JD in Scrubs fantasized about having a perm #TheApprentice pic.twitter.com/Iln7lENj8i \n— Mohsin Arain (@MohsinArain91) October 14, 2015 \nAnd Screech from Saved By The Bell \n— Rob Hayes (@Robhaye5) October 14, 2015 \nPlus, a shout-out to Grace/April Jones.
