This market is projected to reach $167.9 million in 2015 and $670.6 million in 2019, with a compound\nannual growth rate (CAGR) of 33.4% from 2014 to 2019.\n- The multiwall market totaled $143.6 million in 2014. This market is expected to reach $147 million in 2015 and $270.1 million in 2019, with a CAGR of 13.5% from 2014 to 2019.\n- The few wall market is expected to reach $0.3 million in 2015 and $66.7 million in 2019, with a CAGR of 286.1% over the period from 2015 to 2019.\n\nIntroduction & Scope \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nMOTIVATION \nAmong the numerous categories in the evolving field of newly synthesized nanomaterials, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are perhaps among the most dynamic and undergoing the most rapid pace of development. The past 15 years have witnessed relentless growth in the research, development, and technological understanding of these remarkable materials. Universities, small businesses, and start-ups, as well as large corporations, have continued to probe and exploit numerous commercial possibilities for these fascinating materials. As a result, the list of product applications is expanding considerably and is projected to do so well into the future. The most tangible evidence for growth and interest is reflected in the emergence of new CNT producers now capable of offering CNTs in commercial-scale quantities—in kilograms, tonnes, and even hundreds of tonnes, depending on the specific grade—at more affordable and increasingly competitive unit pricing. In addition, after several years of incubation, there is a new breed of more mature university spin-offs, or nanotechnology companies, targeting specific application sectors. \n\nAdditional evidence of growth is the increasing presence of larger, more established corporations that recognize the future market opportunities offered by CNTs. Finally, the past five years have seen phenomenal growth in CNT-related patent activity. U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) analysis during the latest three-year review period (2012 to 2014) revealed that cumulative output exceeded 6,800 issued and 10,000 filed patents, respectively. This represents substantial growth compared with the previous analysis period (2009–2011) and further substantiates the ongoing academic and industrial interest in CNT applications. In view of the technical momentum—representing a multibillion-dollar technology investment—and the enormous business potential, this report provides a timely update on CNTs—their level of technical maturity, where they are starting to penetrate the market place, and when and where the broadening market unravels.\n\nOBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE OF THIS REPORT \nThe primary objectives of this report are threefold:\n- Assess the current state-of-the-art in CNT production and technical applications understanding.\n- Identify the current players seeking to exploit the unique properties of CNTs.\n- Evaluate actual or impending markets in terms of the technical readiness of CNTs and the projected market revenues.\n\nSCOPE OF REPORT \nFollowing the Introduction and Executive Summary chapters, this updated report is then divided into nine major chapters as described below. \n\nChapter Three, Technology Overview, defines CNTs, outlines their history, describes the production methodology, identifies the unique properties of various forms of CNTs and emphasizes the major application challenges. \n\nChapter Four, Patent Analysis, provides an extensive search/analysis of U.S. issued and pending patents (along with Canadian, European, and World Patent & Trademark Office databases where there is no USPTO presence) and a collation of the main technical/application sectors and identifies the most active organizations—U.S. and foreign—driving CNT technology.\n\nChapter Five, Industry Structure and Competitive Analysis, identifies current producers, progress in continuous production scale-up, and market segmentation, and provides\nindustry profiles of the major players.\n\nChapter Six, Markets by Application, represents the body of the report, assessing the latest progress and technical readiness in the major application sectors of composites,\nelectronics, energy storage, membranes, sensors and other applications.\n\nChapter Seven, Global Market Analysis, estimates five-year potential revenues of all notable CNT producers.\n\nChapter Eight, North American Market Analysis, estimates five-year potential revenues of U.S. and Canadian CNT producers.\n\nChapter Nine, European Market Analysis, estimates five-year potential revenues of European CNT producers.\n\nChapter Ten, Asian Market Analysis, estimates five-year potential revenues of Asian CNT producers.\n\nChapter Eleven, Market Pull: Prognosis for Global CNT Applications, identifies the most promising applications realizable based on the leading proponents, technical readiness and market interest.\n\nCONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND TARGET AUDIENCE \nThis report represents a major update to BCC Research's report, Carbon Nanotubes:\nTechnologies and Commercial Prospects (NAN024E) published in July 2012 . The most significant revisions in this new edition include the following:\n- An extensive patent analysis of the U.S. patent database.\n- An in-depth assessment of the unfolding commercial markets.\n- Analysis of progress in the synthesis and commercial scale-up of CNTs.\n- Extensive compilation of the producers and end users dictating market development.\n- A five-year projected market analysis of the emerging CNT industry.\n\nThis comprehensive technical and business assessment on the current status of the CNT industry should prove informative to nanomaterials manufacturers, financial\ninstitutions and investors seeking insights into near-term commercialization opportunities, technologists confronted with nanomaterial device integration issues,\nand companies interested in exploiting revolutionary nanomaterials for advanced composites, biomedical, electronic, energy storage, membranes/separation, sensing,\nsecurity and other emerging applications.\n\nMETHODOLOGY AND SOURCES OF INFORMATION \nThis report is derived primarily from the enormous amount of patent and technical literature relating to CNTs disclosed in the public domain. In addition, complementary\ninformation has been drawn from business community sources, such as company investment news, company profiles, and press releases. Finally, and most importantly,\nBCC Research's project analyst has conducted personal interviews with 12 leading CNT producers shaping the future growth of this industry.\nRead the full report: http://www.reportlinker.com/p0958080-summary/view-report.html \n\nAbout Reportlinker \nReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.
