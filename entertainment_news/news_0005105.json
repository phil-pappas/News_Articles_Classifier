At the film's premiere in London, Caine praised director Paolo Sorrentino who wrote the part for the 82-year-old actor. SOUNDBITE: Actor Michael Caine, saying (English) \"I was amazed you know, and the most amazing thing about it was, it was called 'Youth', and I'm starring in it I thought well, when I read the script I realized, no but it's one of the best scripts I'd had you know and I usually don't play leading parts in movies any more, because I'm too lazy, but this one I had to do it..\" Actress Rachel Weisz plays Lena, Caine's emotionally fragile daughter. SOUNDBITE: Actress Rachel Weisz, saying (English) \"I mean, Michael Caine, Harvey Keitel, Jane Fonda, they're all living legends and they were living legends playing living legends.
