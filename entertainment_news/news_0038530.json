The video highlights a sampling of the treatment program and some of the amenities that the recovery center offers to their patients, as well as some personal testimonial from two graduates of the treatment program offered there. “Our substance abuse treatment center offers one of the best environments to concentrate on recovery from addiction that is available today,” commented Best Drug Rehabilitation founder Per Wickstrom. “This video tour is meant to showcase just a small part of what we have to offer those who come to us seeking help in overcoming their addiction to drugs and alcohol. The real accomplishments of our recovery program belong to the patients. Without their hard work and their steadfast determination to beat their addiction, we would not have the rate of success in rehabilitation that we do.”\nBest Drug Rehabilitation’s Facility Tour Video\nThe Best Drug Rehabilitation facility tour video briefly touches on several of the many different things that the treatment center offers. From their effective recovery program to the various athletics offered, to even the healthy and nutritious meals aimed at healing the damage done to the body by months or years of substance abuse, the rehabilitation strategy at BDR concentrates on healing the individual as a whole, rather than simply addressing the patient’s symptoms of addiction. The counselors and other staff members help their patients to uncover and confront the underlying causes of their drug or alcohol abuse.\nTwo recent graduates of the Best Drug Rehabilitation substance abuse treatment program are also featured in the facility tour video. They share a little about what helped them the most in their recovery from addiction.\nDanielle, a young lady who was struggling with a heroin addiction, explained the basic foundation of the treatment program at Best Drug Rehabilitation. “This is just a really outstanding rehabilitation program,” she shared. “It teaches us why we make certain decisions. It teach us how we can live better, and to be able to decipher right from wrong, which is hard to do during addiction.”\nCarlos also spoke about the care and compassion that he found from not only the staff at BDR, but also the patients. “From the staff members to nursing, the facilitators, the directors, they welcome you with open arms,” he said. “I never thought I could make friends, but I’ve met some very amazing people. They do care about you and you will come out a changed person.”\nFounder Per Wickstrom designed the unique program at Best Drug Rehabilitation after he fought to overcome his own addictions, which spanned a decade. After finally finding a treatment program that worked for him, he realized that not every patient would respond in the same way to any one method of rehabilitation. He decided to base his program around that principle and to offer several different modalities of treatment to the patients at Best Drug Rehabilitation, allowing them to discover the best fit for their personal needs. This helps to create a sense of confidence and an understanding of personal responsibility in recovery from addiction, and has helped Best Drug Rehabilitation see one of the highest successful recovery rates in the field.\nFor more information visit http://www.bestdrugrehabilitation.com .", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iZXN0ZHJ1Z3JlaGFiaWxpdGF0aW9uLmNvbQ=="], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:04:32.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
