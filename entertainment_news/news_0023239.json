Photo: Joe Armao \nOne of the world's most famous film stars will soon be heading to Bendigo. And she's big, really big.\nAn eight-metre-high statue of Marilyn Monroe is among the pieces locked in for a major exhibition of the iconic actress' wardrobe, belongings and memorabilia at the Bendigo Art Gallery in 2016.\nThe gallery has worked with film studio Twentieth Century Fox to bring together items from collections around the world, including a pleated gold lame gown seen in  Gentleman Prefer Blondes , costumes from films including How to Marry a Millionaire , accessories and even the star's personal address book. The giant statue by sculptor Seward Johnson, most recently on display in Palm Springs, is making its first trip outside the United States for the show.\nMarilyn Monroe at her home in Palm Springs, 1954.

On her wish list is a version of the famed white dress from Some Like it Hot , also designed by William Travilla. A request for a dress has been made (there are multiple versions, part of the \"mystery and falsehoods\" surrounding Monroe's costumes, Curtin said), and the Bendigo Art Gallery hopes to lock in its final inventory within weeks.\nThe Marilyn Monroe exhibition is another coup for the small regional gallery which has consistently punched above its weight in terms of exhibition scope and visitor numbers. More than 150,000 people came through its doors for 2012's Grace Kelly: Style Icon exhibition. Numbers tended to spike in years the gallery has produced fashion-focused shows. It was their work with the Grace Kelly show that triggered the interest of Twentieth Century Fox, Quinlan said.\nPersonal, annotated script for How to Marry a Millionaire . Photo: Scott Fortner Collection, California \nIt's an easy bet that Marilyn Monroe will have similar pulling power (in fact, another Monroe-themed exhibition, mostly paintings and photos, is heading to the new Murray Art Museum Albury next year) and Quinlan is unapologetic about putting together an entire exhibition based around a pop culture figure. \n\"I think we're sometimes accused in the industry of going down the popular path. I don't have a problem with that, personally,\" she said. I think we should be really showing worthwhile and exciting and engaging exhibitions and if that's popular, so be it.\"\nThe government backs Quinlan's vision. Launching the exhibition yesterday Premier Daniel Andrews said his government anticipated the exhibition would deliver an $11 million economic benefit to the state, although he wouldn't confirm how much the government had given directly through its major projects fund.\nCocktail dress worn by Marilyn to an event held by the American Academy of Arts and Letters with husband, Arthur Miller in 1959. \n\"I don't see it so much as a cost; it's a sound investment,\" he said. \"The creative industries have almost limitless potential and they know no boundaries.\" \nTickets for Marilyn Monroe go on sale November 16.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T08:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:17:55.673+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
