Featuring some of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s rarer works - Symphony No. 10, Symphony No. 29, Violin Concerto No. 4 in D major and Symphony No. 13 and conducted by violinist Deborah Wong from the concertmaster’s chair. In demand as a guest concertmaster, Wong, a Juilliard School graduate and part of the Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra,has performed in that position with several orchestras throughout the country. In 2002 she was appointed concertmaster of The Greater Bridgeport Symphony.\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756–1791) toured Italy three times between 1769 and 1773 with the goal of absorbing Italian culture, and to make connections that would provide commissions and productions of Mozartian operas for the Italian stage. Mozart wrote a number of symphonies for audiences that received him. He brought an armful of symphonies in his trunk, but in April of 1770 he began to pen five new ones tailored to the circumstances and energies he was experiencing. His Symphony No. 10 is the only one of the lot for which the original manuscript still exists in Mozart’s hand. The style of this symphony was modeled after Italian opera overtures. Though it is in three movements (fast, slow, fast) the entire duration is only about eight minutes.\nMozart completed Symphony No. 29 on April 6, 1774 and is unique among Mozart’s early symphonic works for the special glowing warmth that rises from the variety of its color, and from the imaginative orchestral textures in which it is scored. It was written in the key of A major, which was a key more commonly used in chamber music; a key for intimate thoughts. This is a symphony that glows with intimacy.\nIn the mythology that surrounds Mozart it is often forgotten that he was an excellent violinist. He played violin in professional contexts and to entertain during his tours and kept up his skills throughout his teenage years. Mozart wrote five violin concertos in the summer of 1775 at age nineteen. All five remain in the repertoire, with the third and fifth being heard most frequently in live performances . The fourth, Violin Concerto in D major, is famous for its icy-high first entrance by the soloist.\nOn Mozart’s second trip to Italy he was focused on the composition and production of his opera “Ascanio in Alba,” written for Milan. During this trip he wrote only one symphony - Symphony No. 13. When Mozart wrote music for a specific occasion is was always tailored to the sensibilities of those he was to entertain. Scholars believe that this symphony was written for Viennese nobility who were living Italy, and therefore this symphony was cast in musical mannerisms common to the Mannheim school of Germany rather than to the Italian opera overture style that we heard in the Symphony No. 10.\nAs we close this evening of music by Mozart it is well to remember how unique and precious these pieces are. Though the music of Mozart can be heard in advertisements, ring-tones, video-game music, and in many of the random encounters with musical fragments that bombard 21st century life, the opportunity to focus our complete attention on them, and hear the work performed live, in its entirety, remains special.\nWHO: The Greater Bridgeport Symphony\nWHAT: The Real Amadeus: An Evening In Vienna With Mozart Favorites\nWHERE: Bridgeport’s Klein Auditorium - 910 Fairfield Ave, Bridgeport, CT 06605\nWHEN: October 17, 2015\nTICKETS: Online or call (203) 576-0263\nSingle seat tickets range from $29.00 - $59.00\nGroup tickets range from $23.00 - $53.00\nGroup discounts given based on 12 or more people\nAll children’s tickets are $10.00.
