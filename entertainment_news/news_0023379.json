Trifecta Productions and Huntington’s Giving Creative, a group of creative professionals who have established a local charity, are hosting “Night of the Giving Dead” from 3 to 8 p.m. Sunday, Oct. 25, in front of the Keith-Albee Performing Arts Center on 4th Avenue. This is your opportunity to dress up as a zombie for the filming of a promotional video called “The Escape.” The video will be used in a commercial for a national drone manufacturer. Participants are asked to come to the event dressed as a zombie. Get a taste of Hollywood as makeup professionals will be on hand to provide demonstrations on zombie makeup techniques. Acting coaches will also teach you how to walk and groan like one of the living dead. There will also be contests including best undead zombie, best zombie walk and more. The registration fee is $15 per zombie or a new children’s Halloween costume. All participants will receive onscreen film credit, a professional head shot and a Night of the Giving Dead movie poster. All cash proceeds will go toward purchasing Halloween costumes for underprivileged children at local community centers. Don’t worry if you can’t make it to the event but still want to help. The Huntington Mayor’s Office, located at City Hall, 800 5th Ave., and Papa John’s at Hal Greer Boulevard and 9th Avenue are also collecting new and slightly-used Halloween costumes for boys and girls of all ages through Tuesday, Oct. 27. Those who drop off a new Halloween costume at either location will receive a gift certificate for two free large pizzas from Papa John’s. The costumes collected at Night of the Giving Dead, the Mayor’s Office and Papa John’s will be distributed to the local community centers on Oct. 28, just in time for Trick-or-Treat.
