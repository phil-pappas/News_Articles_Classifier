Bush's national guard service during the Vietnam War. The story cost Mapes her job, and forced Rather's resignation from CBS. \nRobert Redford portrays Rather in the film, and on Wednesday's Good Morning America , Blanchett said it \"was extraordinary\" working with the actor. \nPortraying a real-life person proved a bit more difficult for Blanchett. \"There was a very particular responsibility one has to playing, you know, real-life character like Mary, even though she's behind the camera and not necessarily particularly well known,\" she explained. \"Because the Mary that I met was, you know, vivacious and vital and full of good humor but, of course, the film captures her in absolute freefall.\" \nIn the film, the embattled producer discovers a trove of hateful comments on the Internet -- something Blanchett says was relatively new when the film's events took place. \"Even though it feels like recent history, 2004...the media landscape, the political landscape has changed entirely,\" Blanchett says. \"It was at the beginning of that whole kind of hateful blogosphere.\" \nWe could soon see Blanchett in a very different role. She says she's working with screenwriter/producer Aaron Sorkin on a possible Lucille Ball biopic. The actress called the late comedienne \"one of my all-time great heroes,\" but added that the possibility of a film is still in its \"early days.\" \n\"But Aaron Sorkin and I are talking about...yeah, we don't know what form it's gonna be in,\" she added. \nTruth is out in select theaters Oct. 16.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:13:40.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
