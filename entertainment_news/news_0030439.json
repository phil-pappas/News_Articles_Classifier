Rowling has been adamant that the play is not a prequel and even shot down a fan theory that the child in the play is a young Lord Voldemort. It turns out the play is actually a sequel, an \"eighth story\" set 19 years after the events of \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\" involving Harry's son Albus Severus-- similar to a theory we at Examiner previously considered.\n\"So now you know it really isn't a prequel,\" Rowling tweeted.\nThe synopsis reads:\nIt was always difficult being Harry Potter and it isn’t much easier now that he is an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband and father of three school-age children.\nWhile Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places.\nThe new story was written by Jack Thorne in collaboration with Rowling and will be directed by John Tiffany.\n\"It is very exciting to explore Harry’s world in a brand new way through the live form of theatre,\" the three said. \"Collaborating on this story is exhilarating for all of us and we can’t wait to present the eighth story at the Palace Theatre next summer.\"\nRowling continued, \"The story only exists because the right group of people came together with a brilliant idea about how to present Harry Potter on stage. I’m confident that when audiences see Harry Potter and the Cursed Child they will understand why we chose to tell this story in this way.\"\nThe plot announcement comes just a day after the play's official artwork was revealed. The art depicts wings above a nest-like enclosure enclosing a child, structured similar;y to both a Quidditch snitch and a bird.\nThe play will be staged in two parts, to be seen either on the same day or on consecutive days. Although no casting announcements have been made, Pottermore reports it will include over 30 actors.\n\"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\" will open next fall in London's West End.
