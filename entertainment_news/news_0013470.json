Truman is recalled. The relevance is the commotion about Hillary R. Clinton, the emails that provide fodder to the Republicans and others.\nMr. Truman had been selected as the 1944 candidate for vice president because Mr. Roosevelt did not want Henry Wallace to continue in that office. He was too liberal for the change in politics. He was an unimportant officer in World War I, a haberdasher (clothing merchant) in Kansas City, Mo., and a favorite of the local political boss, Tom Pendergast. That did not impair FDR’s selection as V.P. President Roosevelt suffered a fatal heart attack in April 1945. After Truman assumed office in 1945, an expected focus on him resulted.\nWhen President Truman ran for re-election in 1948, political fire erupted. There was an episode of corruption in his administration by a cabinet member with which Mr. Truman had no involvement. His local ties in Missouri were a source of concern. Many domestic and foreign events were subject to attack.\nI recall in the summer of 1948 my family and their friends, during weekend cocktail gatherings, were very anti-Truman though they were not ardent Republican supporters. Columnists Drew Pearson and Jack Anderson published major journal articles about questionable Truman activities. Truman upset former New York Gov. Thomas E. Dewey.\nAs evidence of that surprise, the day after the election, in its early morning edition, the Chicago Tribune published that Dewey beat Truman. Truman left office in 1952 with a completely negative view of his term in office. One factor was that during the Korean War he removed Gen. Douglas MacArthur, famous in World War II.\nRemarkably, decades later, the perception of his presidency turned 180 degrees. One of the most detailed confirmations of that evolution is David McCullough’s book “Truman” published in 1992. Being very aware of the past, I could not resist studying that biography.\nThe relevance in today’s time is generated by the bombastic attack on Secretary Clinton, which is not unique in our political history. Though television and other media are more pronounced now than in the 1940s, severe attacks on presidential candidates have existed for centuries. Is the personal Internet server of the former secretary of state as exacerbated as the many Truman episodes? Do current attacks achieve the level and effect of those of the mid-century politics? That is a significant subject of consideration.\nSTANLEY HARRIS, JR.\nSavannah\nJohnson’s 1968 basketball team deserves recognition\nAs a former Sol Johnson student-athlete, I still find it perplexing that Johnson’s 1968 AAA state basketball championship team still doesn’t have an official state basketball championship banner hanging on campus.\nIt has been insulting that this great team won the first sports state championship in the school’s history and has been completely ignored by not receiving the school’s acknowledgement for its magnificent accomplishment. Must all of these former basketball team members die before this recognition comes to fruition?\nDuring this period of post Jim Crow history, how could this all black high school exploit and deceive its all black basketball team? This is totally incomprehensible to me because this team personified everything that was great about Johnson.\nAs one of the team’s premier players, I’m definitely not seeking self-gratification or accolades to feed my ego because basketball was a game I played, but I didn’t allow it to define me as a human being. God has defined me and has informed me as to what I’m all about. Therefore, I’m cool with God’s assessment because I know that ego tripping is for people with low self-esteem and not for me.\nIt’s imperative I let readers know this awesome basketball team endured blood, sweat and tears as it accomplished its ultimate goal, which was winning a high school state basketball championship. In essence, this team shouldn’t be treated as if all the players were being exploited on a Southern antebellum slave plantation.\nJohnson’s school motto is “not to equal, but excel.” Therefore it’s now time for this wonderful educational institution to excel by displaying a state championship banner for this dream team that was better than any other basketball team in the state of Georgia in 1968.\nI learned at Johnson that success is a choice and this is something golden and magical that Johnson gave to me. Therefore, I hope I don’t go to my grave thinking that I was duped by a school that gave me so much.\nMy speaking out about the exploitation of the team doesn’t mean I’m stupid, but simply means I’m just fine because I got this.\nI apologize to all Johnsonites for displaying my surreal “bad boy” persona, but I’m being authentic and honest — not superficial. And by just being who I am is beautiful. Trust me, it’s not about me, but the remarkable 1968 AAA state championship basketball team.\nEDWARD MANER\nAugusta\nCommunity comes together for Jazz Festival\nThe Savannah Jazz Festival is one of the best events the city of Savannah sponsors every year.\nFor 34 years the Coastal Jazz Association has brought the citizens of Savannah, Chatham County and lots of visitors together for a wonderful week of free concerts at different attractive locations, culminating in a great evening in Forsyth Park.\nThis year’s huge crowd extended from the band shell to the tennis courts and was comprised of every age, race, gender, religion, and economic and social background. Nothing brings our community together better than good music.\nGORDON VARNEDOE\nSavannah\nCongratulations to Judge Burke on state appointment\nOn behalf of the State Bar of Georgia, I would like to congratulate Chatham County Juvenile Court Presiding Judge LeRoy Burke III on his appointment by Gov. Nathan Deal to serve as a member of the Juvenile Justice State Advisory Group.\nAll Georgians will benefit from Judge Burke’s service with the advisory group, whose objectives include ensuring and enhancing an effective and responsive juvenile justice system in our state. He is also a member of the Juvenile Detention Alternative Initiative State Committee and the Council of Juvenile Court Judges Education and Certification committee.\nBy accepting this appointment, Judge Burke has further demonstrated his commitment to serving the public and the justice system. We wish him well in this capacity of statewide leadership.\nROBERT J.
