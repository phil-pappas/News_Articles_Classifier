Maybe it wasn't.\"So, Bieber began to research the train's legend and discovered a few interesting facts. \n\"I went to Johnny Cash's website tour page, and saw that he had done a show in Hagerstown, Maryland, in 1974,\" he said. \nFurther research showed that the train had been dropped off at a toy train shop in Hagerstown, Maryland, to be repaired because of water damage.

It kept getting in the way. Thank God I kept it.\" \nBiebel appeared on the season premiere of \"Pawn Stars\" Thursday with the train formerly owned by Johnny Cash. \n\"When you walk into the store, there are three pawn brokers set up at computers,\" Bieber said. \"There's a souvenir shop since the show has gotten so popular, but it's still a working pawn shop.\" \nBieber and the pawn shop staff wheeled and dealed, and eventually settled on a nice price for the unique Lionel engine. \n\"I was happy,\" he said. \"It was a nice experience.\" \nBieber appeared on \"Pawn Stars\" on the History Channel on Oct. 22. \nFor more information, visit www.history.com/shows/pawn-stars .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:53:40.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
