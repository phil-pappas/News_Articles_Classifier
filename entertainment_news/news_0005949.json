We may be out of the World Cup at the quarter final stages, but it seems - as a nation - we're still proud. Although Hector did kind of stick the boot in. As if Ian Madigan hadn't had enough knocks at this point (although we'd be lying if we said we didn't think it ourselves).\nYou've done your country proud @IrishRugby . Just wasn't meant to be... All credit to Argentina, immense all over the pitch today!\n— Rory Mcilroy (@McIlroyRory) October 18, 2015 Very proud of our @IrishRugby boys! That was a tough defeat today, but they've given us some great moments during this #RWC #thanksYBIG\n— Maïa Dunphy (@MaiaDunphy) October 18, 2015\nAnd that would be that. Bravo, Argentina. Great performance. Gutted, though.\n— Dara Ó Briain (@daraobriain) October 18, 2015\nJuan Imhoff... What an unbelievable rugby player. Absolutely sensational. @rugbyworldcup #Argentina\n— Will Greenwood (@WillGreenwood) October 18, 2015\nJuan Imhoff... What an unbelievable rugby player. Absolutely sensational. @rugbyworldcup #Argentina\n— Will Greenwood (@WillGreenwood) October 18, 2015 And to Hector...\nWe will never know what might have happened if we got to 23 all ....but the Argentinians were immense 1 to 15 #IREvARG\n— Hector (@hectorirl) October 18, 2015\nSpeaking of the result, captain Jamie Heaslip said: \"Argentina played a very expansive game.They stretched us.They took their chances.We got back to within three points - but then they took their opportunities to kick on. It's very disappointing to lose in such a big game. We didn't help ourselves at the start. We came back into it but we gave ourselves too much to do.\"\nMORE: Watch: Irish fans scrum outside Wembley stadium, before singing Fields of Athenry in Tube Station\nMORE: Watch: The funniest moment of the Rugby World Cup so far went down last night\nMORE: The 10 Best Tweets During the Ireland V France Match", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/McIlroyRory/status/655746056534147073", "https://twitter.com/hectorirl/status/655752750240780288", "https://twitter.com/MaiaDunphy/status/655863375176560641", "https://twitter.com/IrishRugby", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/RWC?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Argentina?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/daraobriain/status/655742583608578048", "https://twitter.com/WillGreenwood/status/655742947900661761", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/thanksYBIG?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/rugbyworldcup", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/IREvARG?src=hash"], "published": "2015-10-19T15:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:50:46.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
