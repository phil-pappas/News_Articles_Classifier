Cyprus was split in 1974 when Turkey invaded after a coup by supporters of union with Greece.\nThe actor's Cyprus trip is his first since being appointed UN Global Advocate for the Elimination of Mines and Explosive Hazards.\nRelated Stories 'I'm over it': Daniel Craig says he's done being James Bond", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:13:40.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
