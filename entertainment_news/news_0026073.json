(Photo by Charles Sykes/Invision/AP) \nNEW YORK, N.Y. – A premiere Friday for season six of AMC’s “The Walking Dead” at New York’s Madison Square Garden was so big and orchestrated, its stars attended a rehearsal that afternoon to prepare. \nThe event, which awarded fans with tickets via giveaways and sweepstakes, screened the season six premiere and then held a panel with 18 cast members. \nThe red carpet itself was moved inside at the last minute due to rain and wind. But that didn’t keep away the fans, many who dressed as zombies, or “walkers,” as they’re called on the series. \n“The Walking Dead” is about people trying to survive in a zombie apocalypse. \nIt premieres Sunday at 9 p.m. Eastern. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T07:09:18.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
