There's a market for him. The more competition that's out there the better - it keeps everybody on their toes.\"Asked about her top musical city, Edith - who has curated a playlist of Sounds of the Neighbourhood for Hotel Indigo - said: \"Romantically I would say Glasgow because of that proud Scot in me, but in reality London's shown be the most amazing journey musicwise in terms of what I've been able to see.\"That's not to say that necessarily about the music that's come from London, it's more about my experience of music in London, being able to see gigs.\"Coming from a little fishing village I didn't have the chance to see all my favourite bands live because the nearest venue was an hour away and my mum and dad worked every night, it was impossible.\"For me, being able to walk to a handful of venues and see anyone I want to is just wonderful.\"Edith Bowman is launching Sounds of the Neighbourhood with Hotel Indigo.
