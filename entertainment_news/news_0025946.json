All my life I've always had great skin, so it was really devastating. Also, at first, I was losing a lot of weight, then I went on tour and I started gaining weight, and it was the most I'd ever gained in my life. I was, like, 115 pounds. Then when I filmed a movie last summer, I actually went under 100 pounds. It was crazy, but things have leveled out, and I'm back to normal. \n\"I still have Hashimoto's. But my numbers are back to normal, and I'm not on medication. I feel good.\" \nVictoria revealed she had tried a number of things, including a strict diet, to get the disease under control. \nShe said: \"This Korean acupuncturist put me on a super-strict diet, where I was a pescatarian [eating fish but no other meat]. I also couldn't eat any sugar, wheat or dairy. I did that for about two months, and it was so intense.\" \nAnd she admitted scrutiny about her appearance was hurtful. \nShe said: \"It definitely did affect my confidence, and it made me a little bit more self-conscious. But at the end of the day, I had the support of my family and friends. I knew that the people around me had my back. Now I really empathise with people who have issues with their skin, because it can get you down.\" bang showbiz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:58:27.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
