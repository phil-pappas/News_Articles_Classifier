According to the site, the procedure involved chest issues, but it's still unknown if it's connected to his lungs or his heart. The surgeries allegedly have taken a toll on him both mentally and emotionally. Sources tell the site that Lamar is in \"fragile mental state.\" The former NBA star has been left upset and emotional and no one is being allowed to see him except Khloe Kardashian . Doctors want Lamar to be in a calm environment while he deals with the immediate physical and mental issues following the surgery. In other report, Lamar snorted cocaine and popping mystery pills in the brothel where he was found unconscious. In a search warrant obtained by the site, which was used by police to take blood from Lamar at the Nevada hospital, a detective said, \"Through interviews with the prostitutes who were with him since that point, it was learned that he possibly ingested cocaine in the bathroom adjoining in the bedroom in which the prostitutes were located along with Mr Odom.\" \"They indicated that they heard him snorting. They indicated that they had vague knowledge of him using illicit narcotics,\" the detective added. According to the site, police interviewed Lamar's personal assistant who confirmed Lamar had taken drugs. Investigators said witnesses saw Lamar taking an \"unknown substance in the form of an unidentified pill, which he obtained from his pocket in a plastic bag that was unmarked.\" Sources say doctors performed blood tests on Lamar that revealed the presence of cocaine. While police have yet to receive the result of the blood sample back, but Lamar could be prosecuted if it shows that cocaine was taken. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T02:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:46:12.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
