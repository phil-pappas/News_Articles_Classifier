He was taking her photos for her, leading her around the bar. The family was really spoiling Kylie. You can tell she felt like a princess.\" \nKylie and Tyga have been romantically linked since he split from Blac Chyna - the mother of his two year old son King - in 2014 but only confirmed their romance recently. celebrity", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:31:48.370+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
