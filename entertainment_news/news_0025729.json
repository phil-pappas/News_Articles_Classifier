How special is to for you?\nIf you keep the success part aside, Baahubali is very special in so many ways. I don't want to consider it special because it turned out to be to be a blockbuster. When I look beyond the numbers, I think this is one film that has taught me no star is bigger the success of a film. While most of us understand films are the efforts of a team, sadly the credit is usually handed over to a director or the hero.\nSo you feel you're not one of the reasons scores of people came to watch Baahubali?\nIrrespective of the film I star in, my fans will come and watch. I think it'd be foolish to even think that people watched the film because of me. There's a lot of difference between being the highlight of a film and taking full credit of its success. As a star, I don't take full credit of the success of Baahubali because every last member of the team worked tirelessly to ensure a smooth release. Those who watched the film also spoke highly of the visual effects, the stunts, the music and even the performance of the rest of the cast.\nDo you think this will change the perspective of other stars and how they treat success in their careers?\nI hope it does. I mean, I can't talk on the behalf of others and neither can I judge them, but I think it's slowly changing and stars have come to terms with the fact that a film no longer rests on the shoulders of its hero. It's also not something you can expect to change overnight; it takes time, stars to have to ditch their ego, it takes a lot of effort, too.\nBut isn't it stars that attract distributors to bet big on their films?\nIt's based on the market value of each actor. Even this fluctuates from film to film as it is directly related to the track record of a star. In the case of Baahubali, Rajamouli's highly successful track record was also taken into consideration by those who invested in the film. I don't think a film should be judged based on its star value. I agree stars draw audiences to the cinemas and help a film cater to the masses, but a film should be judged by its content and not on the basis of who stars in it.\nDid you expect this kind of success for the film?\nFrom the beginning, we wanted the film to be a blockbuster, given its high budget. We never anticipated it would turn out to be so successful. What surprised us the most was that the film did extremely well in Tamil, Hindi and Malayalam, too. The appreciation that we had received from all quarters was also unbelievable. It felt nice when stars like Ranbir Kapoor and Shah Rukh Khan appreciated my performance. Rajinikanth sir called and congratulated me. Such things have never happened before.\nWhat else has the success of Baahubali taught you?\nIt made me realise that an actor should explore opportunities to work in other languages, too. Initially, we had planned to release the film only in Tamil and Telugu, but it was Rajamouli who suggested we release in Hindi and Malayalam, too. We never expected the film to do so well in all the languages it was released in. Another thing it has taught me is that Indian cinema is on par with Hollywood. If we want to make a superhero or war film in the future, we don't have to rely on expertise from the West. All the visual effects work in Baahubali, which was unanimously appreciated, was done in Hyderabad.\nThe film earned you the status of a national star. Do you see yourself doing Hindi films now?\nI'm glad I'm popular, people recognise me wherever I go, but it's too early to be called a national star. One successful film doesn't make someone a star. I've been getting a lot of offers from Bollywood, but it's too early to commit to any project. Unless I'm not relieved of Baahubali 2, I don't think I'll be in a position to sign a new project. Even in Telugu, I was supposed to start a project with a young director but it has also been put on the back-burner for now. But I haven't ruled out of the option of working in Bollywood, provided interesting projects come my way.\nYou are 36, and in the last two years you just had one release. Aren't you concerned about the rate at which you're doing films?\nPeople keep asking me if it was worth spending all this time on Baahubali and trust me when I say that it was totally worth it. Even if I was required to spend another two years on this project, I'd still be willing to do it. An opportunity such as this you get once in a lifetime and it'd be stupid to jeopardise it. I know my fans were a little disappointed that I didn't have a single release for nearly three years but they've enjoyed the success of Baahubali more than me. They were delighted that the film earned me nation-wide recognition.\nYou are still single...\nWell, I still haven't found the right person to settle down with. Marriage is a big responsibility, so, I don't want to rush. With so much of work on my plate, I don't have the time to be in a relationship. When I feel the time is right, I'll find myself a suitable partner.\nAre the rumours about Baahubali 3 true?\nI've been reading about them, too. As far as I know, there are no plans for Baahubali 3. If there was one, I'm sure Rajamouli would've already discussed the possibility with us.\nHow's the preparation going on for the second part in the franchise?\nWe start shooting from mid-November or early December. I've already started growing my moustache. Since my shoulder surgery, I haven't been in the best shape as I was advised not to work out. Now that I'm doing much better, I'll start gymming soon. I weighed around 95 kg in the first part, I have to maintain it and look muscular, too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T06:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T22:30:33.153+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
