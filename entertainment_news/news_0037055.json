Kathleen Eannotti was always a neat freak, and the house was always spotless. Now she was acting out of character, hoarding, becoming irrational and getting angry at inanimate objects.\n\"For example, if I were typing on the computer, she would get angry at the noise of the typing, and we'd get into this huge argument, and she'd take a steak knife and try to stab the computer,\" Martinez said. \"That was shocking to me. It was pretty obvious that something was different.\"\nMartinez said his family always knew there was something \"off\" about certain family members. They thought it was a genetic disease of some sort. Later they found out it was Huntington's disease.\nHuntington's is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder that leads to destruction of cells in a region of the brain called the basal ganglia, which is involved in movement. People with the disease experience symptoms such as involuntary muscle movements — large sweeps of the arms and legs in almost dancelike rhythms medically known as chorea, the Greek word for dance.\nOther symptoms may include slow eye movements and trouble speaking, as well as difficulty organizing tasks, lack of impulse control and trouble absorbing new information. Patients with Huntington's also experience psychiatric symptoms, such as bipolar disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder, according to the Mayo Clinic. Although the later stages can lead to dementia as in Alzheimer's, the motor and behavioral symptoms are more severe and debilitating in the earlier stages of Huntington's.\nA child of a parent with Huntington's disease has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the gene and developing the disease. A genetic test will show whether a person has the gene mutation that causes the disease. People often develop Huntington's in their 30s to 50s, although it can happen in childhood. Medications treat symptoms to ease jerking movements, but no cure exists.\nTypically, a person with Huntington's lives 10 to 20 years after onset. One in 10,000 Americans, or around 30,000 people, have the disease, according to the Huntington's Disease Society of America. It affects men and women equally across races. Folk singer Woody Guthrie, composer of \"This Land Is Your Land,\" was one of the more famous victims.\nMartinez's mother lives in a nursing home in Connecticut. When Martinez began to realize his mother had Huntington's, he was overwhelmed by his own risk.\n\"It's terrifying,\" Martinez said. \"Every twitch, every stumble, every mistake, every forgotten thing is like: 'Was that a symptom?' When I'm falling asleep, if I twitch, that's normal. But is that Huntington's disease? It can cause a lot of depression; it caused depression for me.\"\nMartinez, who now lives in Chicago, hasn't been tested for the gene yet. Neither has his brother, his new nephew nor his three cousins. He said one of them almost certainly will develop the disease.\n\"So we have to prepare,\" he said. \"And that's kind of the motto of the Huntington's community: Prepare for the worst, and hope for the best.\"\nAbout 5 to 7 percent of those at risk for Huntington's choose to be tested, according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Typically, people get the genetic test if they plan to have children of if they want to plan their lives accordingly.\nHer behaviors changed Anthony Martinez Kathleen Eannotti with infant son Anthony.

But as Huntington's set in, that changed. (Anthony Martinez) Martinez said one reason he hasn't been tested for the gene is because a positive result might have a negative effect on long-term health insurance and job opportunities.\nHe added that he would get tested if he and his wife plan to have children. \"Right now, it doesn't seem necessary to know,\" he said. \"I'm going to do everything now to prepare as if I have HD. Just knowing would be like telling me: Here's a time bomb. We're not going to tell you how long until it's going to go off. You're just going to hold on to it, and good luck.\"\nBut Chris Furbee, 49, a documentary filmmaker, said in a phone interview that he was tested for the gene at age 30. His mother had the disease, which traces back to his great-grandmother.\nFurbee lives in the San Francisco Bay area and recently finished a documentary, \"Huntington's Dance,\" which follows his mother coping with the disease. Furbee decided to get the genetic test while filming.\nAfter getting the test, Furbee had to wait two weeks for the results.\n\"It was like the longest two weeks of my life,\" he said. \"I would literally go through these euphoric stages — one minute I'm happy and laughing, and the next minute I'm crying and depressed. I was definitely on a roller coaster of emotions during that period.\"\nFurbee tested positive.\n\"What happened was that I felt like I was searching for something to do with my life, and that basically enabled me to get involved with the Huntington's disease community.\"\nHe didn't notice any symptoms for another 11 or 12 years. He has now been living with the disease for six or seven years.\nIn the film \"Alive and Well,\" which follows seven families affected by Huntington's disease, researcher Dr. Michael Hayden puts it simply: \"Huntington's disease has been described as the most devastating disease known to man, and it's devastating because it robs you of who you are.\"\nLouise Vetter, CEO of the Huntington's Disease Society of America, said that with the rarity of the disease, there is a lack of research funding for it. Unlike other brain conditions, however, scientists know exactly what causes Huntington's, so they may have success more quickly when studying it, which could lead to breakthroughs in other brain diseases.\n\"We feel strongly that improved understanding of science related to Huntington's disease will help open doors to other neurological conditions,\" she said. \"So we would love to see more resources put into Huntington's disease for our families but also for the ripple effect it will have on Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and so many other conditions.\"\nA team of researchers in France is in the very early stages of working on a possible treatment that could slow progression of the disease. The study, \"Triheptanoin Improves Brain Energy Metabolism in Patients With Huntington's Disease,\" appeared online in Neurology earlier this year. The study involved only 10 patients, so results are in the very early stages.\nIn a phone call, study author Dr. Fanny Mochel, with Pitie-Salpetriere University hospital in Paris, said the goal of this treatment is to help patients by altering the way neurons use energy.\n\"The idea is to improve energy function in Huntington's disease,\" said Mochel. \"We think it's going to be useful, but it's really impossible to predict to what extent.\"\nDr. Teepu Siddique, who did not work on the study, is a neurology professor at Northwestern University who studies diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease.\n\"They're trying to improve the metabolic profile of the brain's energy utilization,\" Siddique said. \"Whether that will take care of the problem, I don't know.\"\nJamie Friedlander is a freelance reporter.\n Medical Research Mental Health Research Alzheimer's Disease", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56296019/turbine/ct-cth-huntingtons2428-jpg-20151022", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56296018/turbine/sc-hlth-1028-huntingtons-disease-20151022"], "published": "2015-10-23T21:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:13:10.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
