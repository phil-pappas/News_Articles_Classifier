Chennithala, in a Facebook post, said he had instructed the college management not to take any action against the woman lecturer Deepa Nisanth who had favoured beef festival at the campus. ”I have asked President of Cochin Devaswom Board that runs the Kerala Varma College not to take action against Deepa Nisanth. I believe that political motive is the objective behind the row”, Chennithala said. ”So, it is not at all correct to initiate action against Deepa Nisanth for posting in Facebook in favour of beef feast” Chennithala said. (Also Read: Nitish Kumar, Lalu Prasad slam Narendra Modi over attack on RJD chief beef remark) Cochin Devaswom Board President M P Baskaran Nair had told him that no action has been taken against the teacher. The Board had only sought a report from the college Principal on the incident, Chennithala said. In her Facebook post, Deepa Nisanth, a faculty of the college, had supported the “beef festival” organised by SFI activists on October one to protest against the Dadri lynching incident. Meanwhile, CPI-M veteran V S Achuthanandan also came out against the move to take action against students for conducting the festival and teacher who favoured it. Achuthanandan, Opposition leader in Kerala Assembly, said it was unfortunate that Kerala Varma College management was implementing “Sangh Parivar agenda.” Strongly condemning the lynching of a man in Dadri in Uttar Pradesh over rumours of eating beef, Achuthanandan alleged that “communal fascist forces are trying to transform the nation into a lunatic asylum under the influence of the BJP-led government at the Centre.” Image credit: Twitter \n 30 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:16:36.522+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
