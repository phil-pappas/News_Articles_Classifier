Photo: Takashi Selda \nNew high-wire walk a natural for Sydney So is there any chance that French aerialist Philippe Petit will get to do his long-planned walk from from Sydney Opera House to the Harbour Bridge's southern pylon?\nOne festival director is already investigating the proposal ( reported on Tuesday ) for the man whose daring high-wire walk between New York's Twin Towers has been re-created in both the Oscar-winning documentary Man On Wire and the new Hollywood movie The Walk. \nNew film ... Kate Winslet with Liam Hemsworth in The Dressmaker. \nIt's surely a natural for Destination NSW to back a high-wire performance and potential documentary showcasing both the charismatic performer and the city. \nAdvertisement And while the multiple approvals from various planning authorities and insurance implications seem daunting, Petit tells Short Cuts he has no trouble signing waivers whenever he does a high-wire walk around the world.\n\"I don't believe in insurance,\" he says. \"I always sign the right papers indemnifying​ the people who invite me from any negative thing, which in my opinion can never happen. People say, fine, we're protected, then we go ahead and do a beautiful show.\" \nPhilippe Petit visits Sydney to promote Man On Wire in 2008.
