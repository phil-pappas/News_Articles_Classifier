Sketch by Jane Rosenberg (left) / Photo courtesy HBO Previous -- of -- Next Elizabeth Banks as Gisele Bundchen: The Pittsfield native's role as Vinnie Papale's love interest in Disney's \"Invincible\"certainly gives Banks the leg up for the highly coveted role as Tom Brady's supermodel wife. Fernanda Calfat / Getty (left) and Jamie Trueblood / AP Previous -- of -- Next Rob Gronkowski as Rob Gronkowski: There is only one Gronk. Accept no immitations. Robin Marchant / Getty (left) and Charles Krupa / AP Previous -- of -- Next Casey Affleck as Julian Edelman: The younger Affleck makes perfect sense to take on the role as Tom Brady's favorite receiver and superpal Julian Edelman. Scott Eisen / Getty (left) amd David Lee / Universal Pictures Previous -- of -- Next Advertisement Previous -- of -- Next Conan O'Brien as Roger Goodell: Brookline's own red-headed late-night host would bring a dark, comedic edge to the Commish's character. Richard Drew / AP (left) and Mario Anzuoni / Reuters Previous -- of -- Next Terrence Howard as Ted Wells: Many say the pure acting chops of Howard's \"Hustle & Flow\" is enough to secure the role of lead Deflategate investigator Ted Wells. But sometimes a good mustache can get you places in this world. Handout photo (left) and Damian Dovarganes / AP Previous -- of -- Next Denis Leary as Bill Belichick: Sarcastic? Check. Unwilling to suffer fools lightly? Check. Experience playing a head coach on the big screen... the Browns even! Check. Slam dunk casting. Jim Davis / The Boston Globe (left) and Todd Heisler / New York Times Previous -- of -- Next Craig Robinson as Vince Wilfork: It's pure swagger that gives Robinson the edge to play the former Patriots nose tackle's role in the film. A hot tub that can travel through time certainly helps. Brynn Anderson / AP (left) and Vivian Zink / NBC Previous -- of -- Next John Slattery as Robert Kraft: Boston's own slick John Slattery of \"Mad Men\" fame could certainly portray Patriots wealthy owner and unwavering Brady supporter Robert Kraft. Slattery's role as a Ford executive in \"Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights\" gives him the necessary upper class experience. Gene J.

Gene J. Puskar / AP (left) and Disney Enterprises Previous -- of -- Next Jason Mewes as Jim McNalley and Kevin Smith as John Jastremski: Perhaps this could be the perfect - and hilarious - scene from \"Deflategate,\" as the Patriots locker room equipment attendants deliver Brady a basketball after a texting mishap.

Brad Barket / AP Previous -- of -- Next Dane Cook as the pump: Need to take the air out of a fellow comic? Cook could do the trick. Handout Photos Previous -- of -- Next Michael Schur as the Patriots lawyer who wrote The Wells Report in Context: It's not entirely clear if the writer behind Fire Joe Morgan and \"Parks & Recreation\" - also the actor that played Mose Schrute in \"The Office\" - was the inspiration for wellreportcontext.com. But judging from the breakdown, is sure seems likely.

Previous -- of -- Next James Spader as Jeffrey Kessler: Brady may have only hired high-powered attorney Jeffrey Kessler because Spader's Alan Shore was unavailable... and also fictional.

Berman: The iconic actor of \"Raging Bull\" fits in nicely as New England's favorite U.S. District Court Judge. \"Are you looking at me, Roger?
