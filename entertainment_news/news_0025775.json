The naked street-fighter would be the next motorcycle after the Yamaha YZF-R3 that has recently been launched in the country. Therefore, the couple of units have already been imported in the country for the testing purpose. The MT-03 is a naked version of Yamaha R25 and YZF-R3 that inherits the property of both faired models. The naked street-fighter could make its presence at the 2016 Auto Expo that will be held in Greater Noida. \nThe naked street-fighter is powered by the same 321cc , liquid-cooled, fuel injected and parallel-twin motor delivering 41.6 PS of power at 10,750 RPM and 30 Nm of torque at 9000 RPM. The motor is coupled with a six-speed transmission. The naked motorcycle is 4 KG lighter than the YZF-R3 as the MT-03 weighs 165 KG. Moreover, the MT-03 is featured with compact tapered headlight, LED pilot lamps, massive fuel tank and spilt seat that give an aggressive appeal to the motorcycle. \nRead Also: What is Yamaha R25 Doing at Local Dealership?
