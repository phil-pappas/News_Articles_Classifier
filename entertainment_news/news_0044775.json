Executive produced by horror guru Eli Roth, the first season of the series was based on Brian McGreevy's horror novel of the same name, which began with the savage murder of a teenage girl in a small Pennsylvania town. A supernatural town that happens to be populated by nomadic werewolves, ambiguous monsters, and other strange beings. The second season, not tied down to the source material as McGreevy only wrote one \"Hemlock Grove\" book, had the freedom to further expand the unlikely friendship between werewolf teen Peter Rumancek (played by Landon Liboiron) and the monstrous heir Roman Godfrey (Bill Skarsgard), who came together with the hope of exposing the darkest secrets of their sinister town. Though it seems their goal has shifted a bit as the above preview implies a war over power is brewing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:21:14.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
