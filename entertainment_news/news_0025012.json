Hebert/Invision/AP Testimony ends in trial over Jay Z's rap hit 'Big Pimpin\" 1 / 1 Back to Gallery LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” Testimony has concluded in a copyright infringement case against rapper Jay Z over his 1999 hit \"Big Pimpin'.\"\nLawyers for the rap superstar played deposition testimony Tuesday from a former lawyer for the heir of an Egyptian composer who wrote flute notes included in the song. He was the trial's final witness.\nThe notes are from a 1957 love ballad written by composer Baligh Hamdi and appear throughout \"Big Pimpin',\" which was Jay Z's first major hit. Producer Timbaland paid $100,000 in 2001 to settle a claim about its usage.\nLawyers for Hamdi's nephew, Osama Ahmed Fahmy , contend that Jay Z and Timbaland do not have a valid right to use the song.\nClosing arguments are tentatively scheduled to begin Wednesday but the judge must settle several issues first.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/51/57/8821704/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/51/57/8821704/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-21T01:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T03:36:02.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
