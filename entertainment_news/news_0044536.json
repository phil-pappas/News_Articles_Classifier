Leg 3 of the North American portion of this tour is well underway, and it will unfold in the cool Northern California metropolis on the nights of Friday, November 13 and Saturday, November 14 & Tickets are now available online today at TicketProcess.com or charge by phone toll free.\n(PRWEB) October 09, 2015\nBrooks continues to impress the country music media and thrill his fans throughout the nation by periodically announcing his intentions to play shows at new locations about six weeks in advance of the dates. This allows him and his better half to dictate this tour on their own terms, which may be one of the reasons that it has extended far longer than anyone expected when they initially announced late last summer that Brooks would tour the nation for the first time in a decade and a half.\nOver the last 13 months, he has made himself at home and very comfortable in some of the biggest venues located in some of the biggest cities throughout the country. It is a magical run of shows that has given fans ample opportunities to once again see the living legend that they grew up admiring in the 1990s.\nThe 53-year-old born Troyal Garth Brooks correctly utilized his two “most country” names back in the early 80s while hoping to break into a country music scene that was still very much stuck in the past. Any true fan of country music born in the 70s will tell you that Brooks transformed the genre in the 90s, bringing a healthy splash of rock 'n roll to a state of country music that needed a good jolt and awakening.\nWhen he takes the stage in San Jose's SAP Center, fans are sure to be in for a show unlike they've any they’ve seen before. Garth Brooks fans can purchase ticket online direct at TicketProcess.com or charge by phone toll free beginning today at 10am PDT.\n*TicketProcess.com is not associated or otherwise connected in any form with the college or professional organizations, teams, artists, bands or other performers featured on this site.
