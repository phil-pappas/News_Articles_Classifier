On Saturday , the film won the Special Jury Award at Eurasia International Film Festival in Kazakhstan.\n\"The film was part of the main competition.We were supposed to attend the festival but couldn't because of a few ad shoots in Kolkata. This is our 13th award so far,\" said Aditya. The film is about a couple bound by a chain of work they do for each other. Set during the time of recession, it shows how love gets transformed into labour. Despite being the festival favourite, Aditya has always maintained how awards hardly make a difference. \"They create rifts,\" he had earlier told us. Speaking to us after the win, the director said, \"It's been a great journey . But I strongly feel that it's time to move on.\" ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-09-28T22:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:19:40.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
