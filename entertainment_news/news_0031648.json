Here's a hint: They'll be controversial.\nHe tweeted a joke about Lamar Odom, who is giving his marriage to Khloé​ Kardashian another try after a drug overdose left him near death. Rock tweeted the joke, which was created by Someecards, with the caption, \"Stay strong Lamar.\"\n Stay strong Lamar. pic.twitter.com/oWeciBKR9t\n— Chris Rock (@chrisrock) October 23, 2015\nMore From Cosmopolitan Some fans on Twitter were not too happy.\n@chrisrock Not sure if I should consider this inappropriate or hail you as a God damn genius\n— Jeff Rothman (@amazingjr87) October 23, 2015\n@chrisrock shame on you! That's not something you can joke about it!\n— waldrof (@iconicmoss) October 23, 2015\n@chrisrock Bad timing dude. Let him at least get well enough to leave the hospital before you throw mud at him.\n— Dustie Hamrick (@DustieLee) October 23, 2015\nIt's unlikely he'll apologize — this is Chris Rock we're talking about. With the \"Stay strong, Lamar\" comment, it was clear he was joking out of love. And since you have to have a healthy sense of humor to marry into the Kardashian family, Odom probably would think it was funny.\nFollow Megan on Twitter .", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/chrisrock/status/657381629564948481", "http://www.twitter.com/megancarol", "https://t.co/oWeciBKR9t", "http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/news/a39046/chris-rock-2016-oscars-host/", "https://twitter.com/DustieLee/status/657622366365818881", "https://twitter.com/iconicmoss/status/657644986343780352", "https://twitter.com/chrisrock", "https://twitter.com/amazingjr87/status/657382078737219584"], "published": "2015-10-24T01:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:14:48.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
