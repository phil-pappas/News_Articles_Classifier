Is red wine good for us or not? Why do there seem to be conflicting stories about the risks of vaccination?\" \nDr Arnold, who lectures on applied statistics and has been the election night forecaster for Television New Zealand for the last three general elections, will discuss the reasons that such an important subject cases us all so much frustration and provide insights on how to endure the data deluge. \nHe will be joined by Associate Professor Nancy Bertler from Victoria’s Antarctic Research Centre, who will talk about the potential collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet and how this affects sea level rise predictions. \nRapid deglaciation of West Antarctica remains a primary uncertainty in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predictions future sea level rise. Dr Bertler will discuss the reasons why dynamical responses to warming play a more significant role than is currently captured in climate ice-sheet models, and present results from current research projects that indicate a higher climate sensitivity of the Antarctic ice sheets than previously thought. \nDr Bertler is the leader of the National Ice Core Research Programme, manages the New Zealand Ice Core Research Facility and is the Chief Scientist of the Roosevelt Island Climate Evolution (RICE) project. \nWhere: Quality Hotel Plymouth, corner of Courtenay and Leach Streets, New Plymouth \nWhen: Wednesday 21 October, 5.30-7pm \nIf you would like to attend, email rsvp@vuw.ac.nz with ‘New Plymouth Lecture’ in the subject line or phone 04-463 5791 by Friday 16 October. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
