One minute he's quoting the scriptures to justify his refusal to take part in mixed swimming lessons, the next he's thrown into temptation by both his classmate Lydia and his would-be disciple and good cause, George.\nGrowing pains and a bursting sexuality, it seems, are guided by a blind faith that is prepared to sacrifice anything that gets in its way. This is made flesh here by Benjamin's biology teacher, Erica, who, in between dodging the everyday sexism of her male colleagues becomes an equally obsessed believer.\nShare article Set on an array of wooden surfaces and platforms which his cast navigate, Ramin Gray's production estuarises things up to a more localised degree. This points up just how easy classroom terrorists can be sired even as it acknowledges the play's roots in a Germany which has been dealing with the fallout of extremism from all sides for seventy-odd years.\nSuch a complex crisis-crossing of belief systems and adolescent angst is fiercely and at times wittily delivered by an eight-strong cast led by Daniel O'Keefe as Benjamin and Natalie Radmall-Quirke as Erica, with Farshid Rokey a tragi-comic George. The production's final image, in which private devotion becomes public spectacle by way of grand gestures, resembles a contemporary rendering of classical religious tableaux It's immortality of sorts, even though no-one has a prayer left to call their own.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-16T19:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:23:42.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
