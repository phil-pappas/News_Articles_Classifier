The film, as is the trend, is a horror thriller and marks the directorial debut of editor O Ravishankar.\nTalking about the film, Santhosh says, \"I play a protective dad of a six-year-old girl. There are enough moments of family drama to set this apart from the recent horror films.\" Tanushree Ghosh, who has acted in Telugu and Malayalam films (including Balyakalasakhi with Mammooty), plays his pair. A model from Mumbai, Khushi Rajput, who has just finished acting in a Marathi movie, is playing the other heroine. Actor Jayaprakash plays a crucial role in the film, which has been shot in Yercaud and Salem.\nThe film is in its last stage of shoot, Santhosh informs. \"The last schedule is starting on October 20. We just have the climax scene and some patch work left to be shot,\" he says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:24:15.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
