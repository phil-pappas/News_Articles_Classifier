Nicole Kidman (Compare The Market) \nThe 40-second advert sees some fur flying as Nicole arrives at Aleksandr’s house – to take his meerkat pal Sergei on a date to the movies! \nSneaky Sergei uses his Meerkat Movies 2 for 1 cinema tickets to take Nicole on the date, leaving Aleksandr outraged. Nicole Kidman stars in the new Meerkat Movies advert (Compare The Market) \nMarketing director of Comparethemarket.com, Mark Vile said: “Arnold Schwarzenegger was always going to be a hard act to follow, but having fellow Hollywood icon Nicole Kidman part of the latest TV ad has certainly exceeded our expectations. We hope Sergei going on a date with Nicole will inspire others to take a friend or partner to the cinema this autumn with Meerkat Movies.” \nViewers will see the advert for the first time on Sunday October 4 when it airs on ITV at 7:15pm.
