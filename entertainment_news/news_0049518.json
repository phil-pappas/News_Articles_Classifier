The letter, drafted by Ortwin Freyermuth, General Counsel to Cloud Imperium Games, demands in no uncertain terms that the outlet personally apologize to Chris Roberts' wife Sandi Gardiner, the company's HR manager, publish said apology, and hire an independent party to investigate The Escapist's production of their article including \"any bias of your staff and their involvement with other interested parties and any conspiring arrangements between them.\"Phew. Video games! In case you've missed what is rapidly devolving into 2015's Top Video Game Scandal, here's a brief timeline. Be sure to thoroughly digest each link as there's a lot to unpack here:\nThe Escapist published an article sourcing 9 different current and former employees of Cloud Imperium Games. It contained multiple allegations including racial discrimination, misappropriated funds ( Star Citizen is, to the best of our knowledge, completely crowdfunded to the tune of $90 million), a \"toxic workplace,\" and claims that the developer has bled through nearly 90% of its resources, with feature creep killing the game. Chris Roberts wrote a passionate response thoroughly denying and addressing each claim. t A post on Reddit suggested that some of the Quote: s and anonymous individuals used in the story were lifted directly from Glassdoor Australia, casting doubt on The Escapist's claims that all their sources approached the outlet and were properly vetted. t The Escapist's managing editor John Keefer published a follow-up article explaining in detail how each source was vetted, emphasizing that they were all passed through their legal department for verification. Keefer also insisted that none of the sources were Derek Smart, and that a couple of their sources posted on Glassdoor only after speaking to author Lizzy Finnegan. t Cloud Imperium Games sent the letter we're about to discuss to The Escapist, which is dated October 2. The letter says that Cloud Imperium Games intends to \"turn this matter over to our litigators to prepare legal action in the US and the UK against the individuals and entities involved [...]\" if The Escapist doesn't meet their demands by end of business hours on October 5. The letter in question addresses the majority of the claims reported on by The Escapist, and hurls some accusations right back, calling the allegations \"ridiculous, highly slanderous, and easily disproved.\" Furthermore, the letter accuses The Escapist of participating in a conspiracy between the author and third parties with the \"deliberate intention of inflicting emotional distress and financial harm on the individuals and entities concerned.\" If you thought this wasn't serious, think again.The conclusion of the letter effectively gave The Escapist a 24 hour period -- in which to apologize personally to the developer's HR manager as well as Sandi Gardiner (who is accused of saying \"We aren't hiring a black girl\"), initiate an independent investigation into the production of the original article, and issue a public apology and retraction.Interestingly, the letter refutes the validity of The Escapist's vetting process. See, the author claims she used Company ID cards to verify identity, but Cloud Imperium Games claims in their response that CIG \"does not issue any company ID cards at any of its studios.\" The plot thickens when you see this exchange of tweets suggesting that the ID card the author saw was nothing more than a generic RFID card like this .So is this demand letter merely a strong-arm tactic to bully The Escapist into retracting the article, or will Cloud Imperium Games actually deliver on their threat and pursue a libel lawsuit? That only leads to further questions. Could a defamation suit like this actually even make it to court? If it did, it's almost certain that extensive financial documents would be subpoenaed, easily proving or disproving the claims made by these anonymous sources at The Escapist. Would funds obtained by Cloud Imperium Games from their ongoing Star Citizen crowdfunding campaigns be used to finance the lawsuit? Is involvement with GamerGate really fueling any of this, as so many of my comments on my previous article claim ?All of these questions deserve answers, because we've reached a point in this...I can't think of any word more fitting than scandal ...where enthusiastic backers of the game stand to lose faith, development of the game itself is potentially affected, and a press outlet is facing a lawsuit for allegedly doing their job. All sides become impacted by this now -- gamers included -- and despite any personal doubts I have about Star Citizen getting completed in any reasonable amount of time, all of these questions warrant further investigation. This has gone too not to get to the bottom of things.It's clear that Cloud Imperium Games isn't taking these accusations lightly. It remains to be seen how The Escapist responds. CIG has effectively given then until Monday, October 5 at the end of business hours to respond.", "external_links": ["http://imgur.com/f9m0hIR", "https://twitter.com/lizzyf620/status/650617503450841088", "https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/3n6lum/escapist_anonymous_sources_uncovered/", "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/14979-Chairmans-Response-To-The-Escapist", "http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/features/14715-CIG-Employees-Talk-Star-Citizen-and-the-State-of-the-Company"], "published": "2015-10-05T01:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T20:58:15.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
