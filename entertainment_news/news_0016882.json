The recommendation was approved 3-0 Thursday at the committee level, and the full board will take it up later this month.\nThe reduced rate – if adopted by the board – would be reflected on bills sent after Nov. 1, which cover October water usage.\nRancho spokeswoman Meggan Valencia said the district is still working to meet the state’s water use reduction goals but it no longer can justify the surcharge since it was adopted in response to the MWD’s action.\n“We’re doing pretty good,” she said, pointing to data that show the district has reduced water use by around 30 percent compared with results in 2013.\nThe two-tier surcharge structure that is in place right now charges ratepayers $3.40 per hundred cubic feet of water if they are between 1 and 15 percent over their allotted budgets. Those who exceed 15 percent face an additional cost of $6.80 per hundred cubic feet.\nThe Rancho staff has called for eliminating the second tier, which would reduce revenue generated by the surcharges by 41 percent and have the greatest impact to the district’s residential customers.\nAt least one ratepayer wants the surcharge ended.\nRobert Stites, a Rancho ratepayer, told the board Thursday that the surcharge should be eliminated immediately and the district should reimburse ratepayers for the fees they’ve paid so far.\n“Future exposure to the surcharges are virtually nonexistent,” he said, prefacing his remarks with a detailed breakdown of the district’s financial standing. It showed how much revenue was generated by the surcharges and how much the district has been saving by reducing its reliance on expensive imported water.\nState law requires water districts to charge rates that reflect only the cost of delivering water, which was recently codified by a ruling that called into question how tiered rates were put together in San Juan Capistrano.\nRancho officials have long defended their rate structure, saying it meets all legal requirements.\nContact the writer: 951-368-9698 or aclaverie@pe.com Twitter: @PE_Claverie", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvphpg-b88529713z.120151004102216000giocc99f.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvphpg-b88529713z.120151004102216000giocc99f.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T04:04:15.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
