Vin Diesel’s “The Last Witch Hunter” also tanked with $10.8 million. \nBut, while poor reviews might have sunk “Jem” and “Kasbah,” good reviews couldn’t save “Steve Jobs” either. After two very strong limited-release weekends, the biopic failed to impress in wide release with $7.3 million. \nThe weekend of duds left room for holdovers to take the top spots. In second place, “Goosebumps” earned $15.5 million, while “The Martian” reclaimed its throne in weekend four with $15.9 million.
