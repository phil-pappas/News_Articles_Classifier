Image 12 of 12 Kirsten Dunst mesmerizes in brilliant new ‘Fargo’ 1 / 12 Back to Gallery Actress Kirsten Dunst has grown up on the big screen, winning accolades as a tiny sadistic vampire opposite Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise , a dangerously sheltered teenager in Sofia Coppola ’s indie hit “The Virgin Suicides” and Peter Parker ’s damaged girlfriend in the Sam Raimi-Toby Maguire “Spider-Man” trilogy.\nYet it may be on TV, in her first regular series role, that Dunst makes her most indelible mark.\nIn the biting and bloody second season of “Fargo” (9 p.m. Mondays, FX), the long-anticipated prequel of sorts to last year’s surprise small-screen hit, Dunst portrays Peggy Blumquist , a beautician married to a butcher’s assistant in the town of Luverne, Minnesota.\nPeggy may appear to be a scatterbrained blonde who tends to chatter too fast and too long only to say too little, but she harbors big dreams and an even bigger secret, one that puts both her and her husband in extreme peril.\nShe and her gentle giant of a husband, Ed (a perfectly cast Jesse Plemons , beefier than he was on “Breaking Bad”), are a couple of ordinary people who accidentally get caught up with a notorious North Dakota crime family.\n“I read two of the episodes,” Dunst, 33, told TV critics at a recent press session for the wintry thriller, “and I just thought, ‘Wow, this character is going to go places, and I need to play her.’ Peggy is legendary.”\nThe show’s writer and executive producer Noah Hawley compared the Blumquists to the kind of milquetoast fella gone rogue that we’ve seen before — in both the movie “Fargo” and the first season of the TV series it inspired: William H. Macy ’s put-upon car sales manager Jerry Lundegaard and Martin Freeman ’s hen-pecked life insurance salesman Lester Nygaard .\nIn “Fargo,” Hawley explained, “there’s a certain moral spectrum.”\n“You usually have a character who is basically a purely good person,” he said, “and, then, on the opposite pole, there’s some element of monstrosity. … In the middle, there are characters who could go one way or the other.\n“And that’s the interesting moral dynamic, to take a character like Jerry Lundegaard or Martin Freeman’s character or, this year, Kirsten and Jesse. What if we turn this paradigm into a relationship with a give and take? Will they do the right thing or the wrong thing?”\nHawley’s “good person” last season was police officer Molly Solverson . This go-round, it’s Molly’s dad, Lou Solverson — well, the young version of him — a Minnesota state trooper and family man who recently returned from three tours in Vietnam. He’s played by Patrick Wilson (“The Conjuring”), whom Hawley described as “the archetype of the heroic American male.”\n“Patrick has this quality,” he said. “He’s just a good guy. (In the series), we’ve saddled him with a wife who has cancer and a 6-year-old daughter and this experience in Vietnam. But you’ll never hear him complain … and he’s always going to be the guy who’s first with a smile.”\nAs for the monstrous elements in this “Fargo,” they are many and quite frightening.\nThe new season time-trips us back to 1979, an era full of economic turmoil and desperation. President Carter is on the slide and Ronald Reagan is on the rise.\nAs a metaphor for Dutch’s coming presidency, in fact, Hawley begins season two with what he calls “a fake Ronald Reagan movie from 1951.” It’s in black-and-white, titled “Massacre at Sioux Falls,” and is a rather daring way to begin.\nHe explained that part of this was “just playing around,” but mostly he wanted to communicate the idea that, just as the shivering actors in the faux movie impatiently wait for Reagan to begin the next scene, America also was waiting for the Gipper (eventually played by Bruce Campbell ) to lift them from their doldrums.\nHawley wanted to take the American experience at that moment and try to turn it into a crime story that really was evocative of the late ’70s.\n“There’s definitely an element of the death of the family business and the rise of corporate America,” he said.\nThe family business of the Gerhardts, a rugged North Dakota ranching clan, is crime. Threatening them is the Kansas mafia, a cold, corporate outfit fronted by the humorless Joe Bulo (Brad Garrett, “Everybody Loves Raymond”).\nGerhardt patriarch Otto has suffered a stroke, and his wife, Floyd, has taken over as boss. This frustrates eldest son Dodd ( Jeffrey Donovan , almost unrecognizable here from the likable guy he played in “Burn Notice”), a hothead who’s as cruel as he is ambitoius.\nThe first episode focuses more on youngest son, Rye (Kieran Culkin), whose slight stature, sparse mustache and weasely nature are reminiscent of Steve Buscemi ’s kidnapper character in the movie “Fargo.”\nRye is at the center of a stunning murder sequence and the reason the Blumquists find themselves in such a pickle.\nThis rich tapestry of colorful and corrupt characters is catnip to actors. Ted Danson (“CSI”), who plays Lou’s father-in-law, Sheriff Hank Larsson , said he fell in love with the dialogue and infamous “Fargo”esque way of speaking. “If the words are great and you have a dialect that is purposeful,” he said, “you try it on, and it just takes you someplace.”\nJean Smart didn’t mind leaving all traces of glamour behind to play Gerhardt matriarch Floyd, praising her as “a brilliantly, brilliantly written character” and singling out a speech she gives that speaks to the strength of this woman “who’s seen it all.”\nDunst said there was a comfortable familiarity about her character, considering much of the actress’ own family comes from Minnesota. “My grandma, who is not with us anymore, lived with us forever. She was born and bred in Minnesota. So it’s kind of within my wheelhouse,” she said.\nIt seemed natural, she added, “to step into that accent and … keep your chin up and smile even though all this other stuff is happening, to keep up a good face.”\nShe described Peggy as someone who “has set goals for herself, and nothing is going to stop her.”\n“I don’t think it’s about being smart or oblivious,” she said. “She has such a zeroed-in path of what she wants to do and what she wants to be, and then there is this other part that’s stopping her, that she does come from a small town.”\nAlthough Peggy’s self-absorption and manipulation of her husband is infuriating, Dunst hopes people also will “giggle a little bit to themselves when they see Peggy, because I want people to be on Peggy’s side in a way.\n“I knew that certain things, like wearing little white earmuffs when I’m doing something that is not necessarily right, would help balance out, you know, and give a sense of humor to what Peggy was doing.”\nJudging by the first four episodes, Dunst has mined every such nuance to mesmerizing effect.\nAll of the portrayals are strong, in fact; so is the story, humor and bone-chilling look of this new 10-episode season. The second season of “Fargo” is deliciously on par with its hungrily devoured first.\nJeanne Jakle ’s column appears Wednesdays and Sundays in mySA, and she blogs at Jakle’s Jacuzzi on mySA.com.
