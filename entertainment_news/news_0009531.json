(Photo: Dale Robinette, Hulu)\n2 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Hulu’s Casual isn’t quite what it might first appear to be.\nThe streaming service's 10-episode comedy (Episode 4 is available Wednesday) offers laughs as it focuses on recently divorced mom Valerie (Michaela Watkins) — dipping her toe into the foreign world of contemporary dating — and her bachelor brother Alex (Tommy Dewey), the creator of a dating-app algorithm that provides him an endless supply of beautiful, short-term lovers.\nAlex, 35, enjoys a comfortable Los Angeles lifestyle, but his glibly confident outer shell shields a loneliness. He welcomes Valerie, 39, a successful therapist, and her mature but vulnerable 16-year-old daughter Laura (Tara Lynne Barr) into his home, where the series explores family relationships, insecurities and new rules for romance.\n“They did a little bait and switch. They call it a comedy and then it’s a little serious,” Watkins says of the show, where many laughs emanate from awkward entanglements and character complexities.\nFilm director Jason Reitman ( Up in the Air , Juno ), who directed the first two episodes and is an executive producer, says creator Zander Lehmann’s script “on the surface was about dating at 40 ... and then found its way into so many things. This is a kind of love story about a brother and sister who discuss everything … There’s kind of an openness that is this beautiful bond but also prevents them from having romantic relationships on their own.”\n.\nTommy Dewey plays Alex in the Hulu comedy series, 'Casual.' (Photo: Dale Robinette, Hulu)\nCasual contains a different kind of TV performance from Watkins, 43, a Groundlings improv alum, one-season Saturday Night Live player (2008-09) known for a collection of eccentric characters, including SNL celebrity blogger Angie Tempura; and second wife Jackie in ABC’s Trophy Wife, which was canceled after one season in 2014. (She has also appeared on New Girl , The Goldbergs and Veep. )\nValerie “is not just fun, silliness, which I absolutely love to do. She’s more of a well-rounded person who has a lot going on in life. She’s a mom, she’s going through a divorce, she’s still a sexual being or trying to remember that she is,” Watkins says. “She’s got this incredible relationship with her brother, which for most of it is a really good thing and for parts of it is really dysfunctional.”\nUnlike Trophy Wife 's Jackie, who \"couldn't shut up,\" says Watkins, Valerie is no “chatterbox. She \"understands it’s sometimes better to say less. But I think, like many of my characters, she’s also incredibly sensitive and aware of herself and her surroundings.”\nReitman felt Watkins had the depth to take on a different type of role. “Michaela understands the meaning of every line of dialogue and every moment,” he says. “She’s able to ground scenes in dramatic human emotion and at the same time be hilarious.”\nViewers will learn about Valerie and Alex through their dating experiences and relationships with each other, Laura and their parents, played by Frances Conroy and Fred Melamed.\n“You’ll get to know why Alex appears, at first blush, as a snide, shallow, good-looking bachelor guy. Once you get to meet the parents, you see this whole other side of Alex where he becomes the most empathetic character,” Watkins says. Laura is “the biggest adult in every room,” shifting roles with her mother to a degree after the divorce.\nTara Lynne Barr, left, plays Laura and Michaela Watkins plays Laura's mother, Valerie, in Hulu's 'Casual.' (Photo: Dale Robinette, Hulu)\nHulu has an ambitious slate, picking up The Mindy Project after Fox canceled it; renewing the Amy Poehler-produced Difficult People ; prepping 11/22/63 , an event series starring James Franco and produced by Stephen King and J.J. Abrams; and The Path, produced by Parenthood 's Jason Katims.\nWatkins' busy schedule includes a return engagement on Amazon’s Transparent and a role in The House , an upcoming film starring Poehler and Will Ferrell, but she's also hoping for more seasons of Casual . “I feel like as an actor, you get to use every part of you.”\n2 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN //usat.ly/1LGL16T TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LGL16T&text=Michaela%20Watkins%20shows%20range%20in%20%27Casual%27&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0b406acfbc3771f1085f9564556fd1b219340248/c=272-0-4528-3200&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635805389936260068-Casual-Tara-Lynne-Barr-Michaela-Watkins.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LGL16T&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635805382135380058-Casual-Michaela-Watkins.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1LGL16T", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0b406acfbc3771f1085f9564556fd1b219340248/c=272-0-4528-3200&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635805388352839768-Casual-Tommy-Dewey.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635805382135380058-Casual-Michaela-Watkins.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/54746c894a3e7eb814dc901086d148c74bffc519/c=272-0-4528-3200&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635805382135380058-Casual-Michaela-Watkins.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:03:08.097+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
