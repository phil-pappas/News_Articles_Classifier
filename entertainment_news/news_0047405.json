Battle, top, New York City's first black police officer. Above, Tony Cherot, second from left, on hand when the city named a Harlem intersection for Battle in 2009. A book, right, relates Battle's story. \nIn 1951, his 10-year-old grandson Tony Cherot got to see how. Buy this photo \n\"We took a trip to the South – I'd never been before – and he dropped me off at the beach,\" recalls Cherot, now 74, who grew up in Englewood. \n\"Apparently it was a segregated beach,\" Cherot remembers. \"I'm relatively fair-skinned, and I was just swimming and playing when he showed up to pick me up in the afternoon. The sheriff of the town said, 'What are you doing here? This is a segregated beach.' He said, 'My grandson's down there. Who do you think you are, telling me I can't go on the beach to pick up my grandson?' He wasn't going to back down an inch from that guy.\" \nNerve. Dignity. Self-possession. That, plus an imposing 6-foot, 3-inch physique, were some of the things that had helped Battle, decades earlier, clear a hurdle no one was expected to surmount. On June 28, 1911, at age 28, he broke the color bar at the NYPD. \nIt's a story that Arthur Browne, editorial page editor of The Daily News, spent five years researching for a new book, \"One Righteous Man: Samuel Battle and the Shattering of the Color Line in New York\" (Beacon Press, 309 pp.). \n\"It's this great untold New York and American story,\" says Browne, a Pulitzer prize-winner who also co-wrote the biography \"I, Koch.\" \n\"This is about a man who I think was just such a courageous civil rights figure in his own right, who's simply been forgotten,\" Browne says. \nNot entirely forgotten. In 2009, Cherot was on hand when the intersection of West 135th Street and Lenox Avenue was re-christened \"Samuel J. Battle Plaza\" in honor of his grandfather (Battle had saved a white police officer's life there in 1919, an incident that won him belated acceptance by his fellow officers). \"That was quite a ceremony,\" Cherot recalls. \"I really appreciated how the community of Harlem got behind it.\" \nStill, that hardly begins to tell the story. Imagine, as Browne's book invites us to do, that it's 1911 — and you're the only black cop on the beat. \nHoodlums disrespect you: they've never seen a black man with a badge. And your fellow cops? Battle – an appropriate name – had to fight every step of the way. \n\"He's ostracized, they don't speak to him,\" Browne says. \"There are threats. There was a note with a bullet hole: '[Expletive], if you don't quit, this is what will happen to you.' There was an attempt by a white woman to entrap him.\" \nAnd there are other humiliations: including, in the early days, tourists gawking at him like he was a performing seal. \"He's put on display,\" Browne says. \"Tourists pay to see the African-American police officer on the street.\" \nBut Battle, as Browne points out in his book, was a very unusual police officer – and a very unusual man. \n\"He was a trailblazer, and he opened the doors to many of us who came on the job later,\" says Noel Leader, a retired sergeant, and co-founder of the group 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care. \nBorn into modest circumstances in New Bern, N.C., he was blessed with both brains and brawn. \"His arms were bigger than a lot of people's waists,\" Cherot says. \nTo that add will power, confidence, a hunger for self-improvement, and a belief in the inherent goodness of most people – a belief that was to be sorely tested in his 83-year (1883 to 1966) life. \n\"Battle was a guy who insisted on being treated with dignity,\" Browne says. \"And he was also someone with the self-confidence to relate to anyone on an equal level, white or black.\" \nAfter stints as a waiter, house servant and redcap, Battle found his calling when, in response to pressure from progressive organizations, Board of Aldermen president Patrick McGowan proposed in 1909 that the NYPD be opened to African-Americans. An editorial in New York's biggest black paper, The New York Age, challenged readers to try for the civil service tests; Battle stepped up to the plate. The NYPD found all kinds of reasons to drag its feet (at one point, a doctor disqualified him for a non-existent \"heart murmur.\") In the end, he was hired. \nBut he faced ostracism, harassment, segregation within the force. He was made to sleep alone – ironically, up in the flag loft, next to the very symbol of justice for all. \nBiography rescued © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T11:19:23.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
