She was 31. \nZimmerman apparently lost her footing while trying to cross the Lumahai River on Kauai’s north shore and was swept out to sea, ABC News President James Goldston said in a note to staff on Thursday. She died Monday, according to a note written by Zimmerman’s mother on the doctor’s Facebook page. \nZimmerman researched stories for ABC’s medical unit and also offered meditation sessions for ABC News staff in New York, Goldston said. She travelled in Haiti and the Amazon rain forest, and made a documentary film on Congolese refugee camps. \nHer last Facebook post updated her profile with a smiling picture taken with Kauai’s north shore in the background.
