Imagine if I was a playwright and had a play here? That would be so cool.” \nSure, it would be cool except that the Delaware Theatre Company rarely hosts productions by Delawareans. \nAs Bud Martin, executive director of the theater company, says, “I don’t know too many Delaware-based playwrights, but we’re a regional theater, so whenever we get to work with talent in the region, it helps suit the mission.” \nFor Robson, 49, his dream is becoming a reality this week after nearly two decades writing short and full-length plays. \nHis football-themed “Playing the Assassin” began previews Wednesday ahead of Saturday’s official opening night and will wrap up on Nov. 8. (Tickets are $30-$45 .) Buy Photo \nFrank (left, Ezra Knight) and Lewis (Garrett Lee Hendricks) square off in \"Playing the Assassin\" at the Delaware Theatre Company.

But Mr. Robson’s compelling dialogue and forceful characters provide so much theatrical energy that once the play takes off, no one in the audience will quibble about its improbabilities.” Rihanna to mentor Delaware's Nadjah Nicole on 'The Voice' \nAnd, yes, the review is hanging on the wall at Robson’s home. After all, it took nearly 20 years of writing plays to get one. \n“That was a big day,” he says. “To me, it’s all about whether the play has a continued life and after the review, I knew it would just based on that.” \nIt came at a good time. Even though he loved writing, a ton of success had not found him. Buy Photo \nDavid Robson is the playwright behind \"Playing the Assassin\" at the Delaware Theatre Company. (Photo: WILLIAM BRETZGER/THE NEWS JOURNAL) \n“There have been many times when I’m like, ‘Why am I still writing plays?’” he says during a chat ahead of a dress rehearsal earlier this week. “I enjoy it and I get a production once in a while, but it’s kind of like shouting in space and no one can hear you scream.” \nBut he adds, “You have to be satisfied because there’s something you like about the process. If you’re doing it just to get notoriety or good reviews – and that’s always really nice – it’s not going to keep you going. There has to be that internal drive.” \nThis is the show’s third run with the same two-man cast and director. Ezra Knight, who the Times wrote gave a “powerhouse performance,” is teamed up Garrett Lee Hendricks with Joe Brancato directing. Tracy Morgan coming back to Delaware after crash \nThe 85-minute play is loosely based on a true story. \nIn 1978, New England Patriots receiver Darryl Stingley reached for a preseason pass and was hit hard by Oakland Raiders safety Jack “The Assassin” Tatum – a hit that left Stingley paralyzed. \n“Assassin” is set 20 years later.

(Photo: WILLIAM BRETZGER/THE NEWS JOURNAL) \nThe character of Frank (Knight) mirrors Tatum as a football player whose hit left a man in a wheelchair for the rest of his life. He meets with a television producer (Lewis) about the possibility of the former football players appearing together on air just before the Super Bowl. \nRobson first had the idea for the play after reading the headline of Tatum’s obituary in 2010. It read, “Jack Tatum dies at 61; Oakland Raider safety whose hit left Darryl Stingley paralyzed.” \n“He was more than that. Anyone is more than that one terrible thing they’ve done or didn’t mean to do – an event that they are defined by,” says Wilmington’s Robson, an associate professor teaching English and creative writing at Delaware County Community College in Media, Pennsylvania. “Sure he was a hard player, but that is what you’re supposed to do as a football player. \n“So when I read that and realized they had never had a reunion, I thought there’s the play. There’s unfinished business there.” Foxcatcher, du Pont subject of ESPN doc \nWhile the world of football hangs all around the play, “Assassin” focuses more on humanity, redemption and reconciliation and not the game that connected the pair for eternity. \nEven though “Assassin” is about more than football, it has come out at a time when hard hits, concussions and player safety are at the forefront in the National Football League. \nIt’s undoubtedly a fortuitous twist of fate for Robson. And Martin happily adds, “For a producer looking to sell tickets, as well. I used to always say people make their luck, but in this case, it really was lucky.” IF YOU GO \nWhat: “Playing the Assassin,” written by Delaware playwright David Robson \nWhen: Runs through Nov. 8 \nWhere: Delaware Theatre Company, 200 Water St., Wilmington \nInformation: delawaretheatre.org \nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.
