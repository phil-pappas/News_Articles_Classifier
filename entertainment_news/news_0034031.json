Abrams film. \nThe original \"teaser\" for \"Force Awakens\" debuted in November to much fanfare with over 40 million YouTube views in less than three days. \nThe second teaser, which included our first look at the return of Chewbacca and Harrison Ford's Han Solo, eclipsed 200 million views in roughly a month. \nDisney, which acquired Lucasfilm from \"Star Wars creator George Lucas in 2012 for $4 billion, has worked masterful strokes over the past months to promote a film that in many ways doesn't need promotion. \nThe house of mouse has done this by giving fans glimpses of footage and plot as well as announcing that its theme parks in California and Florida will be getting two 14-acre \"Star Wars\" expansions -- the largest Disney has ever undertaken. \nThe company even made the film's merchandising launch into a full fledged event calling it \"Force Friday.\" \nMonday night is just another example of Disney seamlessly using its interconnected conglomerate to promote the film as it takes one of its most valuable assets, ESPN, to market another. \n\"We are managing all of this with great care,\" said Disney's CEO Bob Iger during the company's earnings call in May. \"I think we've got something here that is very, very special that's going to create value for the company for many, many years to come.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:26:49.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
