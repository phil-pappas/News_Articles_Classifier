There's much less of a feel of an open world than in previous titles, when you were mostly left to your own devices; the payoff is far more detail in the home-design part of the game, which is truly charming: Once you've chosen a theme and placed all your furniture in the right spots, the game takes you on a Grand Designs -style mini tour of your finished product, complete with typically wacky background music. One for younger players, certainly, but teens will enjoy it too.  AH \nDVD\nJUDEX, Criterion Unrated \nFrom left, Harrison Ford, Melanie Griffith and Sigourney Weaver in the movie Working Girl . \nCreated by the French silent filmmaker Louis Feuillade​ in 1916, the mysterious vigilante Judex was the original Caped Crusader: a stylish but implacable dispenser of justice, specialising in avenging crimes committed by the rich against the poor. The character was revived by Georges Franju​ in this sophisticated but loving 1963 tribute, which recalls the deadpan surrealism of Rene Magritte. The title role is played by the American magician Channing Pollock, but Franju gives him perversely little screen time, keeping the focus on two contrasting women: the virtuous widow Jacqueline (Edith Scob​), and the scheming femme fatale Diana (Francine Berge​) who slinks around in a black catsuit like another of Feuillade's famous creations, Irma Vep. The breathlessly paced narrative eschews psychology or even logic: characters routinely assume multiple identities, and the dead have a tendency to spring back to life. There are elements of science fiction – Judex keeps watch on his foes with an early form of video surveillance – but Franju follows Feuillade in his \"documentary\" use of location, implying that these strange events are unfolding in a universe at least adjacent to our own. JW\nAdvertisement  \nFREE-TO-AIR\nJudex starring Channing Pollock and Edith Scob. \nBLINDSPOT, OCTOBER 28, SEVEN, 8.30pm \nTerrorists are everywhere in TV police procedurals these days, but this new US series at least tries to put a new spin on it. In tonight's opening episode, Times Square in New York City is evacuated (apparently the extraordinary shot of the empty space is real; no CGI) when a suspicious bag is found unattended and with a note reading simply 'Call the FBI'. When specialists get near the bag however, it suddenly unzips and out steps a (very attractive) completely naked woman (Jaimie Alexander) adorned head-to-toe in complex tattoos. She doesn't know her identity and has no memory, but a tattoo on her back begins the unravelling of the mystery - it's the name Kurt Sutter, a gruff FBI agent (Australian Sullivan Stapleton, best known for Animal Kingdom ) who will, of course, lead the case and who instantly recognises that the labyrinth of tattoos all reveal times, places, and obscure references to terrorist-related activities. It's all utterly implausible, of course, but an interesting twist on the standard FBI agent-versus-terrorists plot. KN\nDVD\nGames: Animal Crossing . Photo: Supplied \nWORKING GIRL, PAYLESS (M) \nMike Nichols' 1988 comedy-drama is about the erotics of deal-making: the key line comes when Sigourney Weaver, as the high-powered Manhattan businesswoman Katherine Parker, proposes marriage with the words \"Let's merge\". What Katherine hasn't realised is that she has competition in her new assistant Tess (Melanie Griffith), a plucky dreamer from Staten Island who has spent the past five years putting herself through night school. Some kind of electric current flows between the pair – Katherine is downright flirtatious on their first encounter – and when opportunity knocks, Tess sets out to become her boss, stepping into her shoes (and beige power suits) to orchestrate a takeover bid of her own. There's a touch of Single White Female to this ostensible feel-good entertainment, yet Griffith retains a vulnerability that takes the edge off Tess' lack of scruple, while Weaver's imperious yet giddy manner is hardly that of a straightforward villainess. As the befuddled love interest of both women, Harrison Ford makes you wish he made more romantic comedies in his prime: his square, worried, goofy good looks seem built to withstand any amount of humiliation. JW\nDOCUMENTARY\nNew TV: Blindspot . \nTHE SEARCH FOR FREEDOM, UNIVERSAL SONY (PG) \nYou might expect a visual feast of adventure sports by leading heroes including Robbie Maddison, Tony Hawk, Robby Naish, Glenn Singleman and the like. But there is much more to this slick production. It is the discussion of what drives sportspeople to extreme challenges that is the most captivating. Singleman is a Sydney emergency doctor  and a legendary base jumper and wingsuit flyer. He figures that he and his wife's (Heather Swan) desire to push themselves comes down to their DNA. FMX rider Maddison acknowledges the need for a challenge was something he always carried as a kid, reinforced by a gust of wind to his face while visiting the grave site of the original motorcycle stunt legend Evel Knievel. The footage covers several sports – surfing, skiing, sailboarding, rock climbing, skateboarding, long boarding. The documentary includes excellent background from people such as Warren Miller (adventure ski films), Bob McKnight (a founder of Quiksilver),  rock climber Ron Kauk, mountain-bike pioneer Gary Fisher, skateboarder Danny Way, and snowboarders Annie Boulanger​ and Jeremy Jones.
