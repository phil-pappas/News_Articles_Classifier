But its pink blossoms in spring are magnificent, they’re beautiful in flower arrangements, and the deer make spectacles of themselves standing on hind legs decimating the lower branches. Still, a tree is a tree, and the crabapple is low enough to the ground to be an appealing challenge for young people to climb. Andrew Keller loves to climb trees, and his mother has a special recipe for homemade crabapple sauce. When Shari Farrell spotted Andrew in the tree, his adventure became a promotion for the 40th annual Apple Time Fair at the Cornwall Presbyterian Church at 222 Hudson St. in Cornwall on Hudson. It is taking place from 10 a.m.-3 p.m. today, and if attending from a distance, it will be a lovely drive through the beautiful countryside with the leaves offering a magnificent show. The fair will have plenty of baked goods, crafts and holiday items. Also there’s a Bargain Basement sale with gently used books, games, toys and jewelry. The snack booth will be open as well as the gourmet coffee corner. Enjoy.
