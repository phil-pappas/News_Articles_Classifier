Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and her husband Jean-Bernard (Beretta/Sims/Rex) \nCheryl and her husband are rarely seen in public together, but they put on a happy display as they entered Kensington Roof Gardens. \nJB kept a protective arm around his wife – and chivalrously carried the presents – as she flashed her legs in a thigh-high split dress. Amanda Holden (Beretta/Sims/Rex) \nAlso joining the party were Britain’s Got Talent judges Amanda Holden, David Walliams and Alesha Dixon. \nAlesha used Twitter to give fans a sneak peek of her outfit before she arrived. \n— Alesha Dixon (@AleshaOfficial) October 15, 2015 \nA cohort of ITV morning TV stars turned up to celebrate, including This Morning’s Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield, Eamonn Holmes and wife Ruth Langsford, and newly announced Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan. \nVernon Kay was flying solo without wife Tess Daly, but there were plenty of friends to cheer him up, including Jimmy Carr, Keith Lemon creator Leigh Francis and Paddy McGuinness. Fearne Cotton and Jesse Wood (Beretta/Sims/Rex) \nFearne Cotton stunned in a lacy mini-dress just one month after giving birth to daughter Honey as she arrived with husband Jesse Wood. \nShe later shared a snap of her and pal Davina McCall to celebrate the ex-Big Brother host’s own 48th birthday. Happy birthday to my amazing friend, the Angel woman that is @ThisisDavina ❤️ pic.twitter.com/2I6BFvcyNC \n— fearne cotton (@Fearnecotton) October 16, 2015 \nEighties hitmakers Black Lace turned up to party, apparently performing a special set for their fellow guests featuring classics Agadoo, Superman and Do The Conga. \nThe night obviously ended well as Ant McPartlin’s wife Lisa Armstrong ditched her heels as she left the venue with her husband of nine years, while Declan Donnelly was led out by the hand by wife Ali Astall, who he married in August. Ant McPartlin with his wife Lisa (Rex) \nDec hit the milestone on September 25, but Ant will have to wait until November 18 to turn the big 4-0. Declan Donnelly with wife Ali (Rex) \nThe two birthday boys looked a little different from the throwback snap that pal Piers posted. At @antanddec 40th birthday party.
