I think the discussions that I've had have been robust,\" Oliver told the committee.\"Mr Cameron is reviewing everything and seems to be interrogating it really well… Parents in Britain and people involved in public health need to hold Mr Cameron to be brave and strong and support him.\"Oliver went on to say: \"We've normalised the consumption of fizzy drinks at home… it's completely inappropriate.\"He also challenged opponents of a sugar tax by questioning which interests are actually \"running the country\".\"Is it the businesses who are profiting in ill health in our children or is it us?
