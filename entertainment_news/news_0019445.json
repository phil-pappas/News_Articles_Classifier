(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File) Sponsored Links The Associated Press LOS ANGELES â€” \nAerosmith frontman Steven Tyler is asking Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to stop using the power ballad \"Dream On\" at campaign events. \nAttorneys for Tyler sent a second cease-and-desist letter to Trump's campaign committee on Saturday. \nThe letter says that Trump does \"not have our client's permission to use 'Dream On'\" or any of Tyler's other songs and that it \"gives the false impression that he is connected with or endorses Mr. Trump's presidential bid.\" \nTyler, who is a registered Republican, attended the GOP contenders' first debate in August. \nAttorney Dina LaPolt said in a statement that the letter is not a \"political\" or \"personal issue with Mr. Trump,\" but it's one of permission and copyright. \nRepresentatives for Trump did not immediately respond to request for comment.
