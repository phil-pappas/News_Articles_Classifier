Now, the lead scientist of the historic NASA expedition is ready to tell the whole story. \nAlan Stern, principal investigator of the New Horizons mission, has a deal with Picador for a \"behind the scenes\" account of July's flyby. \nThe publisher announced Thursday that the book is called \"Chasing New Horizons: Inside Humankind's First Mission to Pluto.\" It's scheduled for publication in spring 2017. David Grinspoon, a planetary scientist and award-winning science writer, will co-write the book. \nJuly's unprecedented encounter with the dwarf planet was the last stop on NASA's long tour of our solar-system, dating back to when Pluto was a full-fledged planet. Scientists in charge of New Horizons have hoped the new observations will restore Pluto's honor. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
