Charlie Neibergall / AP file Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has agreed to host \"Saturday Night Live\" next month. NBC said its former \"Celebrity Apprentice\" host will be the headliner of the Nov. 7 show. By: Rob Golum Bloomberg, Published on Tue Oct 13 2015 Photos View photos zoom Republican Presidential hopeful Donald Trump will host NBC’s Saturday Night Live on Nov. 7, months after the network dropped the billionaire businessman for remarks he made about Mexican immigrants. It’s the second time he’s hosted the program, the network said Tuesday in a statement. Trump previously anchored NBC’s live comedy show on April 3, 2004. Trump’s return marks an about-face for Comcast Corp.’s NBCUniversal, which cut its ties to the executive after he derided Mexican immigrants as rapists. The annual Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants, joint ventures with Trump, were dropped from the network in the wake of those comments and Trump ended his participation in another program, The Celebrity Apprentice . Saturday Night Live is produced in association with Broadway Video. The creator and executive producer is Lorne Michaels. The show has a long history of having politicians as hosts, according to a fan website. They include Vice President Al Gore, the Reverend Jesse Jackson, New York Mayor Ed Koch and U.S. Senator John McCain.
