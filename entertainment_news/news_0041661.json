Photo: supplied \nDrama is alive and well on Australian commercial television. Well, one drama, at least. Because Seven has stuck to its promise of ending The X Factor before 9pm, more than a million viewers in the mainland capitals are able to watch 800 Words and still get to bed by 10.Other dramas aren't so healthy – the next most popular is House Husbands , with 715,000 viewers in the mainland capitals. Seven's much-trumpeted revival Heroes Reborn could only manage 444,000.\nBut fantasy of a different sort is thriving on Ten, with The Bachelorette rising to 992,000 – much bigger numbers than achieved by most episodes of The Bachelor . It is now the most popular \"reality\" show on the box, with The Block averaging about 850,000 on weekdays and Celebrity Apprentice below 600,000.\nThis year's AFL grand final was not the most watched AFL event of the century (that happened in 2005, with 3.4 million in the mainland capitals watching the match between the Sydney Swans and West Coast Eagles) but it did pull 372,000 in Sydney, suggesting aerial ping pong can make a serious claim to be Australia's national sport.\nOsher and Sam on The Bachelorette. Photo: Channel Ten \nThe NRL grand final was also not a record breaker (the most watched biffo-GF this century was in 2014, with 2.6 million viewers). Despite being an all-Queensland event, the NRL pulled 909,000 viewers in Sydney. But the 409,000 Melbourne people watching what is supposed to be a north-eastern game suggests it also has a strong claim to the title of national sport, especially when we learn that it had 1.3 million viewers on regional stations, compared with 900,000 regional viewers for the AFL.\nAdvertisement OzTAM estimates these were the most watched shows in the week ending October 5:\n#1 AFL grand final (Seven) 2.64m in the mainland capitals\n#2 NRL grand final (Nine) 2.31m\n#3 Seven News Saturday (Seven) 1.37m\n#4 Nine News Sunday (Nine) 1.26m\n#5 800 words (Seven) 1.16m", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T09:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:12:13.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
