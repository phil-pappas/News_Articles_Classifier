Nor should they. The Sonic Youth-esque whirl of \"Spring Hall Convert,\" from breakthrough Cryptograms , is just as masterful as the dreamy stateliness of Halcyon Digest single \"Helicopter.\" Yet, any stylistic departures here feel a little forced, most evident in the funk riff on \"Snakeskin.\" \nIf the execution isn't fully there, however, it's still more fascinating to hear Deerhunter take on whatever style Bradford Cox endeavors than most other upper-tier indie rock bands. As little as I liked \"Breaker\" when I first heard it, its hooks are irresistible and Cox's and Lockett Pundt's vocals fit together wonderfully. The album falters when dream-pop sensibilities overtake (as on second track \"Living My Life\") and thrives when Deerhunter are doing what they do best. Title track \"All the Same\" is idiosyncratic in both melody and lyrical content, but also brings an energy that is vibrant and engaging. Advertisement \nOverall, Fading Frontier feels as thought it would have made more sense if it had come after 2010's Halcyon Digest . The albums share similar palettes and Monomania would have felt even bolder after this lapse into serenity. Yet Fading Frontier still clears a wide-open space for Deerhunter's future. Here's hoping it will be filled with something a little more adventurous. \nCoheed and Cambria \nThe Color Before the Sun \nThe Color Before the Sun feels less significant and magnificent than many of its predecessors. That, coupled with the aforementioned familiarity, results in a slightly underwhelming statement overall; however, the album \"does\" reveal its charms with repeatedly listens, and there are certainly many standout moments scattered throughout. All in all, The Color Before the Sun doesn't come close to matching Coheed and Cambria's greatest achievements, but it's a very worthwhile journey in its own right, and most fans will still find plenty to adore. \nSatan \nAtom By Atom \nAtom By Atom finds the five British lads who recorded Court in the Act all those years ago (1983 to be exact) positively putting that shock and excitement back into metal. You won't be reminded of the heaviness and the boogie-ooogie-ooogie of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal because for a moment you'll be blasted back so far in time that you'll forget that it ever existed and then spring boarded into the future where all shall hail the glory that is Satan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T06:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:58:16.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
