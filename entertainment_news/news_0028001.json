Janice Dickinson alleged she and Cosby had dinner in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, in 1982 and he gave her a glass of red wine and a pill she believed was for menstrual cramps. \"The last thing I remember was Bill Cosby in a patchwork robe, dropping his robe and getting on top of me. And I remember a lot of pain,\" she told \"Entertainment Tonight.\" Cosby's attorney said in a statement that Dickinson's allegation was a \"fabricated lie\" that contradicted what she wrote in her autobiography and what she said during a 2002 New York Observer interview. Hide Caption 2 of 26 26 photos: Who are Cosby's accusers? Heidi Thomas says she met Cosby in 1984 and visited him at a house outside of Reno, Nevada, for \"coaching.\" At the time, she was a 24-year-old aspiring actress and model known as Heidi Johnson.

Linda Brown was a 21-year-old model in 1969 when, she alleges, Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in Canada near her hometown.

One night after taping his sitcom, he invited her back to his bungalow and fixed her a \"redeye\" (a Bloody Mary topped with beer), she alleged. \"The next thing I remember was coming to on his couch while being undressed,\" she told Hollywood Elsewhere. \"I was sickened by what was happening to me and shocked that this man I had idolized was now raping me. Of course I told no one.\" It was the first of two similar incidents, said Tarshis, who is now a journalist and publicist. Hide Caption 8 of 26 26 photos: Who are Cosby's accusers? Linda Joy Traitz said Cosby offered her a ride home while she was working as a waitress at a restaurant in Los Angeles that he co-owned in 1969. On the way, they detoured to the beach. They parked and he offered her drugs \"to relax,\" she alleged. After refusing \"he kept offering me the pills,\" she alleged, and it made her feel uncomfortable. She claimed he then groped her chest, pushing her down in the seat and toward the door, and tried to lie on top of her. She got out of the car and ran, she said. She added that she was \"absolutely not\" raped. He tried to calm her, she said, then drove her home in silence. Traitz has a criminal record in Florida and spent time in prison on a conviction for drug trafficking, according to state records. Cosby's lawyer passed on her lengthy rap sheet. Traitz spoke openly about her record to CNN. Hide Caption 9 of 26 26 photos: Who are Cosby's accusers? Playboy bunny Victoria Valentino said her friend Francesca Emerson first introduced her to Cosby hoping to help her get work on his show \"I Spy\" in the late '60s. Valentino said after an interview in his trailer, Cosby invited her and a different friend to dinner, where they drank red wine and Cosby offered her pills to \"cheer up,\" she said. She said she felt \"stoned,\" slurring her words. They then went with him to what she described as a \"ballers pad,\" an office-like space in an apartment building, with two loveseats and no working phone. Valentino said she was feeling \"totally out of it\" when she saw Cosby attempting to advance on her passed-out friend. She said she began reaching out to Cosby to pull him off her friend when he pushed her down, first pushing himself near her mouth, before turning her around and raping her. Hide Caption 10 of 26 26 photos: Who are Cosby's accusers? Famed model Beverly Johnson alleged that Bill Cosby drugged her in the 1980s at his Manhattan brownstone, where she'd gone to rehearse lines. During the meeting, Johnson said, Cosby was \"very insistent\" she drink a cup of cappuccino he had made for her. \"After that second sip, I knew I had been drugged,\" she alleged. \"It was very powerful, it came on very quickly.\" Johnson said she then confronted and cursed at the comedian, claiming, \"I wanted him to know he had drugged me.\" She alleged that Cosby got angry, grabbed her, took her outside and flagged down a taxi for her. Cosby's attorney didn't immediately return a CNN call for comment on Johnson's allegation, which she first made in a Vanity Fair article. Hide Caption 11 of 26 26 photos: Who are Cosby's accusers? In 1970, Tamara Green was an aspiring model in her early 20s. She alleged an incident occurred during a working lunch with Cosby and others. Green told Matt Lauer of the \"Today\" show that at the lunch, she was suffering from the flu and Cosby \"produced two capsules.\" She said they made her feel \"great\" at first, but then left her \"almost literally face down on the table of this restaurant.\" Cosby took her to her apartment and started \"groping me and kissing me and touching me and handling me and you know, taking off my clothes,\" Green said. Green further detailed her allegations in a defamation lawsuit against Cosby filed in December. Hide Caption 12 of 26 26 photos: Who are Cosby's accusers?

The alleged sexual assault took place in 1974 when Huth was 15 years old. According to court documents, Huth and a 16-year-old friend met with Cosby and eventually went to the Playboy Mansion with him. \"He then proceeded to sexually molest her by attempting to put his hand down her pants and then taking her hand in his hand and performing a sex act on himself without her consent,\" according to the documents. Cosby's lawyer said Huth's claims are \"absolutely false\" and he accused her of engaging in extortion after Cosby rejected her \"outrageous demand for money in order not to make her allegations public.\" Hide Caption 13 of 26 26 photos: Who are Cosby's accusers? P.J. Masten was a Playboy bunny in her 20s and met Cosby while working as a server at one of Playboy's establishments.

Before the dinner, attended by four other men at the Whitehall Hotel, Masten said, Cosby poured her a drink. \"And the next thing I know, it was 4 o'clock in the morning,\" Masten said. \"I woke up in a bed naked, bruised. He was lying next to me, and I slithered out of the bed, my clothes all over the floor. ... I got myself together, I went downstairs, I got in a cab and I went home.\" Masten recalled \"hurting really bad.\" As to why, she alleged: \"There were bruise marks all over me. I knew I was raped by him.\" Hide Caption 14 of 26 26 photos: Who are Cosby's accusers?

Hayes claimed she and her friends tried to avoid Cosby, but he caught up with them in a restaurant, \"approached me from behind and reached over my shoulder and grabbed my right breast.\" \"I was stunned and angry, because he had no right to do that and I did not know why he would behave that way,\" Hayes said. \"His behavior was like that of a predator.\" Hide Caption 15 of 26 26 photos: Who are Cosby's accusers?

After becoming ill, Motsinger said Cosby gave her what she thought was an aspirin. \"After that there was some conversation and laughing and stuff, but then the next thing I remember ... he's next to me, he's got his hands on me and I look up I see the lights of the city. I could see it clear as a bell in my mind right now, the lights of the city coming back and it was all blurry, kind of the lights, and I passed out again,\" she said.

The comedian touched her shoulders then tried repeatedly to get Gumpel to have a drink he'd made, she said. After her refusals, Gumpel said, \"Cosby turned his back to me and walked to the door.

Actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner appears at the Grammys in February. The veteran comedian and actor has been accused of sexual misconduct spanning decades by more than 40 women. In a court deposition 10 years ago, Cosby said he had sexual relationships with at least five women outside his marriage and gave prescription sedatives to women with whom he wanted to have sex. Read More Cosby, 78, has never been criminally charged and has vehemently denied wrongdoing. He was tentatively scheduled to give a sworn deposition Friday in a civil suit alleging he sexually assaulted a 15-year-old girl at the Playboy Mansion in 1974. NBC's \"Dateline\" was scheduled to air a joint interview Friday with 27 of Cosby's accusers. And just last week three more women came forward to accuse Cosby of sexually inappropriate behavior, including sexual assault, dating back to the 1970s. As fellow entertainers have increasingly denounced Cosby, his \"Cosby Show\" co-stars have expressed a range of more muted responses. Phylicia Rashad, Cosby's TV wife, expressed support for him in January , saying the allegations were \"orchestrated\" as part of an effort to keep him off television. Since then she has said little about the scandal. Bill Cosby as Dr. Cliff Huxtable with his \"Cosby Show\" co-stars, from left: Tempestt Bledsoe, Lisa Bonet, Malcolm-Jamal Warner, Phylicia Rashad, Keshia Knight Pulliam and Sabrina Le Beauf. Keshia Knight Pulliam, who played the youngest Huxtable daughter, defended the show's legacy in an interview published this week. \"You can't take back the impact that it's had on generations of kids, and it's continuing to have such a positive impact on them,\" the actress told the Grio. As for the accusations against Cosby, Pulliam said, \"That's just not the man I know.\" Cosby's other TV daughters, actresses Sabrina Le Beauf, Lisa Bonet and Tempestt Bledsoe, have not commented publicly on the allegations. But actor Joseph C. Phillips, who played Cosby's son-in-law for three seasons on the show, posted an online essay in July headlined, \"Of course Bill Cosby is guilty!\" \"As the accusations began to increase, I became increasingly disturbed,\" he wrote. \"I was fairly certain that some of the women were lying through their teeth, but certainly not all of them.\" Pulliam, the youngest daughter on \"The Cosby Show,\" has defended the program's legacy. In comments in January about the Cosby accusations, Warner expressed cautious support for his former TV dad. \"I can't really speak on any of the allegations because obviously, I was not there. The Bill Cosby I know has been great to me and great for a lot of people. What he's done for comedy and television has been legendary and history-making. What he's done for the black community and education has been invaluable. That's the Bill Cosby I know. I can't speak on the other stuff,\" Warner told Billboard . After \"The Cosby Show\" ended in 1992, Warner has had a successful second career as a director and Grammy-winning musician. He told the AP this week that he has been in touch with Cosby, but he declined to comment on their conversations. \"I think the things that we discussed really have to stay private between us,\" said Warner, 45. \"But it's just a bad situation all around -- for him, for his family, the women, their families, the legacy of the show.\" More from Entertainment", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:03:13.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
