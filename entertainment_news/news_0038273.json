Brown/ASSOCIATED PRESS Jim Bob Duggar (front center) and his wife Michelle (r.) lead 12 of their 13 children to a polling place in Springdale, Ark., in 2002. Five women have filed a lawsuit against a Christian ministry with ties to the Duggar family, claiming the scandal-plagued Illinois nonprofit covered up the sexual abuse they suffered there as minors.\nThe suit filed Tuesday accuses the Institute in Basic Life Principles and its board of directors of launching a \"sham investigation\" to hide allegations that IBLP agents and employees sexually abused, harassed and inappropriately touched the victims multiple times.\nEach of the plaintiffs — Gretchen Wilkinson, Charis Barker, Rachel Frost, Rachel Lees and a Jane Doe — is seeking $50,000 in damages in the lawsuit against five IBLP directors.\nMost of the women were minors when they joined the organization as program or seminar participants and were later hired.\nBETH HALL/ASSOCIATED PRESS Eighteen of the 19 members of the Duggar family pose for a photo at Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport in Highfil, Ark. on May 9, 2008. It's the latest problem for the troubled ministry, founded by Bill Gothard who resigned last year amid allegations he sexually harassed more than 30 women, the Washington Post reported .\nIBLP is also where reality TV star Josh Duggar was sent by his family as a teenager after he admitted he molested his sisters, according to In Touch magazine.\nThe five women allege IBLP acted negligently when its directors didn't report the \"serious, potentially criminal allegations\" to authorities.\nYouTube Bill Gothard is the founder of the Institue in Basic Life Principles who stepped down last year amid sexual harassment allegations. The ministry began an internal probe in February 2014, paying an allegedly unqualified organization $50,000 after decades of allegations had piled up, according to the lawsuit.\nThe probe, which the women allege was launched just to conceal the wrongdoings, found \"no criminal activity has been discovered\" nine months later.\nIBLP did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.\nmchan@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories Duggar enters 'treatment center' for reported sex addiction Josh Duggar accused of underage sexual abuse Duggar wisdom: wives should be 'joyfully available' for sex", "external_links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/10/22/five-women-sue-bill-gothards-ministry-that-has-ties-to-the-duggars/"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:10:50.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
