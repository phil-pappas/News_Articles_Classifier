(AFP/File) \nJoe Jonas says Gigi Hadid \"was a badass\" co-director. \nThe DNCE frontman convinced his model girlfriend of five months to get behind the camera to help oversee his band's new music video for the track ' Cake By the Ocean ' and says \"everybody really looked up to her\" on the set. \nThe 26-year-old star told PEOPLE.com: \"It was her idea for the video and we were like f**k it, you should do the video, and she just ran with it. \n\"She had a megaphone. She was a badass. Everybody really looked up to her to lead and she really came through and showed us that she could do it.\" \nJoe also recently praised Gigi, 20, for speaking out against body shaming. \nThe model posted a message on Instagram in which she hit back at the haters who blasted her figure, and Joe later said: \n\"I'm really proud of her. I think it's something that needs to be spoken about especially in that community. The industry seems to be changing for models, and it's great that she can have a voice.\" \nGigi is the face and body of Australian swimwear brand Sea Folly. (Instagram) \nThe blonde beauty was initially hurt after being criticised and thought about quitting modelling. \nShe previously said: \"I am human and try not to read it all the time - but it does get to me, I think that when you go through something like that, and you're really almost letting it affect what you think of yourself - it was getting to a place where I was almost like, 'Should I be here?' And I was like, 'This isn't okay.' I shouldn't be questioning doing my job because people are being mean on the Internet.\" \nA scene from the video for Cake By the Ocean, directed by Gigi Hadid and available on iTunes.
