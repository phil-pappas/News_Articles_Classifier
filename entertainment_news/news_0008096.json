The national average has decreased 3.7 cents a gallon during the last month and stands 84.5 cents lower than a year ago.\n“Falling gasoline prices have been the name of the game after a brief hiatus,” said Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst for GasBuddy.com. “Forty-nine of the nation’s 50 states saw gasoline prices falling an average of six cents a gallon during the last week, while the Midwest, previously hit with price spikes, saw among the biggest declines as some refiners returned from maintenance, easing supply concerns.\n“Oil prices also took a break after seeing the largest weekly increase since 2009 to post a big decrease last week.”\nDeHaan said the gasoline price environment remains vastly improved versus a year ago.\n“Just 13.4 percent of the nation’s gas stations are selling at over $2.50 a gallon today, while a year ago, 100 percent of stations were over that mark,” he said. “Nearly a quarter of the nation’s gasoline stations are currently selling under $2 a gallon, and that number will likely grow in the months ahead as refiners continue to finish maintenance and resume producing gasoline at a time when demand is low, contributing downward pressure to gasoline prices.”\nFor a complete listing of current averages and other fuel price data, visit http://media.gasbuddy.com.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-19T17:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:05:52.779+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
