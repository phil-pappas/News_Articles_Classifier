Back | Next Photo by Ben Brengman for the Savannah Morning News - Savannah Arts #6 Kerry Halliburton sets the ball against Cedartown High. By Dennis Knight The Savannah Arts volleyball team has been battle-tested against the top teams in the Coastal Empire — and the Panthers looked the part Wednesday as they cruised to a three-set win over visiting Cedartown.\nSavannah Arts won by set scores of 25-7, 25-12, 25-17 to advance to the second round of the GHSA Class AAA playoffs. The Panthers, who entered the playoffs ranked seventh in the state among Class AAA schools by Score Atlanta, improved to 29-8 on the season. Savannah Arts will host No. 1-ranked Blessed Trinity (38-18) next Tuesday.\n“It’s all about chemistry with our team,” said Savannah Arts coach Jeff Fortson, in his first year leading the program. “Every girl on our team got on the court tonight, and we played as a team — making every touch and point count. It’s all about the team with these girls, and everyone is believing.”\nSenior outside hitter Peyton Vacala, the Region 1-AAA player of the year, had 11 kills, five digs and eight aces on the night. Brai Fortson, the coach’s daughter, had a big night with nine kills, three digs and an ace from her outside hitter position.\nSenior middle blocker Emily Daugherty played strong at the net and added eight kills, five digs and three aces, while setter Kerry Halliburton ran the offense well with 18 assists and eight digs.\n“Kerry is such a great setter — she had really big shoes to fill when she replaced her sister, Darby,” Vacala said. “We all love the way she plays — she gets to every ball and she is dedicated to the game.”\nSavannah Arts dominated from the start against Cedartown as the Panthers jumped out to a 20-3 lead in the first set. Mackenzie Jeffries fired an ace to set up game point, and Vacala knocked home the winner. Vacala scored the final four service points in the second set, and had seven straight service points in the third set as the Panthers ran away with it.\nNext up for the Panthers is Blessed Trinity, the defending state champion in Class AAA, who also won the state crown in 2012.\n“We haven’t faced Blessed Trinity, but we split with Glynn Academy, which won Area 3- , and we gave St. Vincent’s all they could handle and played really well against Calvary Day,” Jeff Fortson said. “We have shown we can play with the elite teams, and we have all week to prepare.”\nHalliburton, the junior setter, said the team is playing well together and she believes the Panthers can get even farther than last season when they reached the Elite Eight. She thinks a rowdy home crowd could have an impact against a talented team like Blessed Trinity.\n“We’ve got a unique gym, and when it gets packed, it can get really loud,” Halliburton said. “We need to get as many people as possible out for the Blessed Trinity. It could make a difference.”", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14810175.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14810181.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14810181.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14810176.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14810174.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14810174.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14810176.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14810175.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T16:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:06:12.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
