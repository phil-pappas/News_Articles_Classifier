Now, Sheeran has his own film 'Ed Sheeran Jumpers for Goalposts' and on Thursday night (October 22), he was guest of honour at the premiere of the film. However, he wasn't the only focus of the red carpet, as Canadian pop star Justin Bieber also attended, although he appeared to keep it low-key in a hooded top. 'Ed Sheeran Jumpers for Goalposts' is a documentary that follows Sheeran as he played three sold out concerts at Wembley Stadium - something which he had always dreamed of. 'Ed Sheeran: Jumpers for Goalposts' will be in select cinemas worldwide from October 23 to 25.  //reut.rs/1MJj7nh", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T23:10:26.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
