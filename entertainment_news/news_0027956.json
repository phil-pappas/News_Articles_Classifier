James talked to the Enquirer about his start in the business, how his act has taken him around the world and performing at the request of President Barack Obama. \nEnquirer: I just watched your trick where you saw a doctor in half that you did on “America’s Got Talent.” It hurts your brain trying to figure it out. How hard is it to come up with tricks that are unique these days? \nJames: “It’s a lot of fun. There’s so many steps. The first step is just to try to do it all on paper, just try to figure out different methods. They’re all going to have positives and negatives and you kind of have to weight everything out. \n“Then you try to build it out of cardboard and duct tape, see if the dimensions are going to work, the hard physicality of everything. And then once you decide on that, you get to the wood and metal stage. That’s a little more serious, a little more expensive. \n“Then finally you probably build two or three of them before you get in front of an audience and you start to test it with the crowd. You never know, that first show, how it’s going to go. They either like it or they don’t. But when you’re actually getting applause for something that started as a little notion, it’s really soul-fulfilling.” \nYou’ve been all over the world with your act, and performed for President Obama. \n“We did a Halloween show for him and 500 of his friends and family.” \nWhat was that like? \n“It was a blast because I’m a history geek. I love history and they were very nice to us. It was his first year in office and they called us up and said, ‘We want you do our Halloween show.’” \nDo you change what you’re doing depending on what country you’re in? \n“Yeah, sure. Some routines I can just turn the music on and go do it without speaking. Some routines are a little more verbal dependent. I’ll either learn a little bit in that language or we’ll have a translator. I can pretty much take most of the dialogue out of my things.” \nWhere was the most appreciative audience, and where was the hardest room? \n“Philadelphia was tough. I don’t know why. They stand out as being a very jaded audience (laughs). That will come back and bite me.” \nI don’t know if they get the Enquirer down there. \n“We were in this beautiful, 300-year-old, gorgeous opera house, so maybe it was the stuffiness of the place that made them a little tough. Or maybe they just see everything there. \n“The most amazing place was in Ecuador, where I don’t think any of the people had seen a magic show before. We were playing a small arena where there were 8,000 people in the audience and the reactions were just off the charts when these people saw us. Everything was brand new to them.” \nHow did “The Illusionists” get started? \n“Three years ago, at the Sydney Opera House, the producer had a three-week gig in conjunction with the Sydney Opera House. So it was just going to be this multi-magician show. We were kind of headhunted and we thought it was a three-week gig. \n“There was some kind of amazing synergy that happened that everything clicked. It sold out right away; we broke box office records and we just kind of knew we had something special after that gig. Because the numbers were so good and the reaction was so good, the producer was able to start doing all this out-of-the-country work. We did Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Mexico, South America, all of Europe, the Middle East, Eastern Europe. \n“We did that for about three years and this last November, we opened up on Broadway and we were the fourth-top grossing show on Broadway. That began the North American tour.” \nIt’s a good year for Broadway and magic; Penn & Teller were just there. \n“Yep; they were in the same theater we were in.” \nYou’ve been to Colon, right? \n“I grew up in a little village called Jonesville; it was about 2,000 people. Still is. There were no magicians in town when I started. It was me and six library books, and I was the only one checking them out over and over. \n“This was before the Internet. There was nothing. Me and six books. So I talked my parents into driving me over there. At the corner of the town there was a big billboard that said Magic Capital of the World. I about flipped out in the car when I saw that.” \n“I was just soaking it up like a sponge. Every year I’d be at (Abbot’s Magic Get Together). I have friends there that I met, and they’re lifelong friends. In fact, one of the other guys in the show with me is named Jeff Hobson. He and I met at the get-together when we were like 14. He’s The Trickster in the show. So it’s amazing how long some of us have known each other.” \nWhat’s the experience of seeing “The Illusionists”? \n“It’s got the energy of a rock ‘n’ roll concert. It’s really well produced, high energy. We’ve got a great video team. We’ve got high def screens, high def cameras. There’s a roving cameraman so you can get in behind things where normally you couldn’t go. Some of the more intimate things are captured very well on the screen. \n“Andrew (Basso)’s our escape artist, he does a water torture cell in full view. So he gets lowered into a tank of water upside down and he’s picking these locks and things. The hand-held camera’s right there on his face so you’re seeing everything. \n“Instead of seeing one person for two hours and having the same vibe the whole time, it’s like a big smorgasbord. There’s seven of us and we all have our own specialties. We’re all the best in the world at what we do. \n“It’s not a kids show, but its definitely kid friendly...If you want to feel like a kid again, you’ve got to come see our show.” \nContact Andy Fitzpatrick at 269-966-0697 or afitzpatrick@battlecreekenquirer.com.
