It was almost impossible in the 1970s and 1980s to find a college student who didn't own a copy of the book, or who at least had read it.\nThe flowing words and imaginative tales made it a perfect selection for the theater of the mind. That means it's not the typical book selected to be adapted into a feature film.\nWriter-director Roger Allers and 11 other directors came up with a way to adapt the writing to both honor the original work and create a linear flow for the audience. Their efforts give us \"Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet.\"\nThe animated film uses the story of exiled artist and poet Mustafa (voiced by Liam Neeson) and his relationship with a young girl (Quvenzhane Wallis) and her mother (Salma Hayek) as the central theme off which the assorted stories spring.\nMustafa's story is interesting as he evades the local authorities who believe his words will cause people to riot. But it is just a vehicle to get from one stunning bit of animation to the next.\nThe 12 directors on the project bring vastly diverse visions to presenting Gibran's words in eight independently made shorts. Each animated tale uses stunning visuals to present the ideas by Gibran.\nAnimators like Tomm Moore (\"Song of the Sea\") and Joann Sfar (\"The Rabbi's Cat\") have been given freedom to interpret the writing. That freedom shows in images that are organically stunning.\nThere are many times when the beauty of the animation eclipses the words. But the film always seems to settle back into a collaborative production that does justice to the book and offers an additional level of entertainment.\nIt's almost an injustice when the film slips back to its central story. The saving grace is Neeson, whose voicing of Mustafa has both a gravitas and grace that makes each word sound like it is being delivered by demons and saints. There is a distinct quality to Neeson's voice that makes us hang on his every word. He is the perfect fit for the film's lead character, who has special skill at telling tales.\nThe remaining voices are acceptable. The real star of \"The Prophet\" is the animation. The visuals make this a film a craft of art that also has spiritual uplifting of words.\n'THE PROPHET'\nMovie Review\n3.5 stars out of 4\nRated PG for thematic elements\nStars: Liam Neeson, Quvenzhane Wallis, Alfred Molina, Salma Hayek\nDirected by 12 different directors\nRunning time: 85 minutes\n(c)2015 The Fresno Bee (Fresno, Calif.)\nVisit The Fresno Bee (Fresno, Calif.) at www.fresnobee.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1734106", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1734106&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1734106&h=Movie+review%3A+%27The+Prophet%27+soars+on+stunning+visuals"], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:14:57.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
