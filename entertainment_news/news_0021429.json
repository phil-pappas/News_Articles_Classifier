Courtesy Bill Medley wasn't fazed by being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with his Righteous Brothers singing partner Bobby Hatfield. But having the distinction of having the most played song on the radio? That's another story.By the way, if your trivia is a little weak on this subject, that would be the 1964 megahit, \"You've Lost that Lovin' Feelin.'\"\"I don't think you can wrap your brain around it,\" he said in a phone interview. \"I don't get it. It's a wonderful thing.\"Medley has been performing for nearly 60 years, both with and without Hatfield. Medley has continued performing and touring since Hatfield's death in 2003. He is bringing his classic sound to the Cheyenne Civic Center on Oct. 29. His daughter, McKenna, will perform with him.He said the show consists of Righteous Brothers hits, as well as the hits Medley picked up during his solo career.\"It's a great cross between music and entertainment,\" he said. \"I will keep going as long as people are still out there. They'll have to come get me off stage with a shotgun.\"He said his favorite part of performing is the audience.\"The audience is what makes it work,\" he said. \"The more they feed you, the more you get back. Watching the reaction, that's just the best.\"He kicked off The Righteous Brothers' lengthy career in 1963 by penning their first hit, \"Little Latin Lupe Lu,\" inspired by a girl he dated. Although he and Hatfield were performing together in a larger band, they would occasionally break away and perform duets.Although Medley scored their first hit with his song, he said once he and his singing partner met Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, he immediately knew he wasn't a songwriter.\"It's very hard to be a writer and also be on the road, performing,\" he said. \"I'm not sure if I quit writing or just lost track of time.\"Instead, Medley focused his time on producing their albums.\"Literally in the '60s, if I wasn't on the road, I was in the studio,\" he said.Even though Medley is heavily touring now, this wasn't always the case. Back in the 1970s, for example, he was told by a doctor he would never sing again because of a lack of proper vocal care. \"It's like running on a sprained ankle,\" he said. \"When I lost my voice, I started taking voice lessons. I'm singing better now and more comfortable than I ever have.\" If you go The Righteous Brothers' Bill Medley will perform hits from his career, along with daughter McKenna Medley When: Oct. 29, 7:30 p.m. Where: Cheyenne Civic Center, 510 W. 20th St. Tickets: $40-$70.
