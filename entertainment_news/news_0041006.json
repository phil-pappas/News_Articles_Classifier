Its revitalization projects have attracted more than $50 million in private and grant investments, increased municipal revenues annually in entertainment and pillow taxes and reduced borough expenses in infrastructure repairs such as ADA curb ramps, sidewalks, additional lighting, and underground repairs. In the same ten years, the borough invested a total of $360,000 in MSG with a $138 return for each dollar spent. This calculation only includes specific revitalization project amounts, not MSG's wide variety of community improvement initiatives and services. Many hours of staff and volunteer time is necessary for community events, Fa ade Improvement Grant and Zero Interest Loan administration, business support projects and recruiting, town-specific marketing, events, social media, PR materials (all created to promote the town) and services such as \"From the Ground Up.\" These initiatives preserve the town's historic integrity and uplift the quality of life for the community and tourists alike. \nAs a gatherer of both community commitment and money for the borough, MSG creates and facilitates plans such as the Interpretive Plan, Steinwehr Avenue Revitalization Plan, 150th Anniversary Plan, and now the Pathways to Success-Ten Year Revitalization and Business Recruitment Plan, all at minimal cost to the borough. Most plans of this nature cost tens of thousands of dollars each for the plan alone, some six figures. MSG is proficient in the complicated process for finding state and federal grants and soliciting private contributions to lower the cost for the municipality both in planning and execution, something the borough could not do without a 501(c)3. The new Baltimore Street Historic Pathway Revitalization Project is well on its way and an example of an important project to the community. kAmxE E2<6D DA64:2= D<:==D E@ H@C< H:E9 8C@FAD H:E9 5:G6CD6 A6CDA64E:G6D 2?5 EFC?
