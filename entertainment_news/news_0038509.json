My buddy Eugene lifted one of the copies his brother kept stashed under the flip-up turntable on the record player in their bedroom – a spot their mother never looked. Eugene slipped the magazine pressed under his sweatshirt and brought it to show me and our friend Richie.\nHe presented it to us slowly and gently, as if the magazine was made of woven spider webs, like it was some precious Egyptian object from a museum or, as Richie said, “the way you take the priest's vestments out of the closet in the sacristy at church.”\nWe were all altar boys.\nAlthough not so much on that chilly fall afternoon.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nPlayboy: Detroit is America's unsexiest city\nEugene had agreed to “borrow” one of the magazines and show it to us. His brother wouldn’t be around for a few hours and he wanted to prove to us that he wasn’t lying when he told us his brother had a couple of copies.\nHe removed it cautiously from under his sweatshirt because his brother would kill him if he ripped any of the pages, or even bent them. Richie and I weren’t allowed to touch the pages or even get too close to the magazine and breathe on it.\nAs it turned out, when Eugene held the magazine a certain way it kind of opened up the page we were interested in, which had another page folded into it. And there she was, a Playboy centerfold.\nThe lady in the picture didn’t look like any of the women from our neighborhood in the steel mill town where we lived outside of Pittsburgh.\nI believe Richie said, “Is she real?”\nThen Eugene gently refolded the page and closed the magazine and slipped it back under his sweatshirt and hustled back home.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nParty time! Playboy names U-M a Top 10 party school\nThat picture, and the few others we got a glimpse of, became the topic of conversation for several days at school. Some of our friends pretended not to believe that we'd actually seen it but you could tell by the way they looked at us they were jealous.\nNow I've read that Playboy is stripping the naked pictures from its magazine and that it already had removed all nudity from its website.\nI didn’t even know Playboy had a website.\nThe article also said that traffic to the Playboy website increased by millions of young users after the change. Supposedly because the articles are well done and pornography is so readily available on the Internet these days that any nudity published in the magazine now seems … quaint.\nI guess that’s how the secret stash under Eugene’s brother’s turntable now appears.\nQuaint.\nImagine that.\nA few days after we looked at the centerfold all of the altar boys at our parish had to go to make our regular weekly confession. I marched into the confessional like everyone else but there was no way I was telling a priest about what I’d looked at. It was a sin I was willing with live with, and then to spend a few days or weeks or months or decades in purgatory.\nI still am, I suppose.\nUnless there’s some kind of papal pardon available on account of what Playboy just did.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/494ce366a04293905f9836da7b6b13d07d7c79fb/c=0-102-2800-1684&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/08/20/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635756756948214222-ThinkstockPhotos-135031502-1-.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/326f7eb2019422a6859dd15bf42c2b8faee9997b/c=816-0-4080-3264/local/-/media/2015/09/14/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635778376246852273-AP-Oregon-St-Michigan-Footba.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T20:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:09:46.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
