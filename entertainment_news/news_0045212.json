I was bullied at school, I used to get told I had pig nostrils.' I said, 'For my own demons, it would be sticking two middle fingers up to the bullies of my childhood.' \n\"If you watch the DVDs, you'll see me oinking backstage (in outtakes)... I brought up the pig subject myself.\" \nDespite the comparisons between herself and puppet character Denise, Natalie insists she is not at all offended by the likeness: \"I've already made the comparison of my nostrils to a pig, so I can't complain (about Denise)!\" Copyright WENN.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T23:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:05:08.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
