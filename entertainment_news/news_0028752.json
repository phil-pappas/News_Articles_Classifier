Thakkar | October 24, 2015, 06.31 am Ranveer Singh Some actors go to great lengths to get into the character they’re portraying on screen. And while Aamir Khan is a name that certainly comes to mind in the context, Ranveer Singh is another one. We hear that recently, while shooting a war scene for Bajirao Mastani, the actor had to look haggard and worn out, so he chose to go without a bath throughout the filming of that scene, which lasted a few days.\nA source says, “He didn’t take a shower for many days to get the right look and feel. Director Sanjay Leela Bhansali was happy with his effort.” In the past, Aamir went without a bath for days, while shooting the climax scene of Ghulam.
