Bang Showbiz Local Real Estate Subscribe Now \nDREW Barrymore has admitted she suffered from postpartum depression after giving birth to her youngest daughter Frankie, 17 months. \nThe Blended star - who has daughters Frankie, 17 months, and Olive, three with husband Will Kopelman - admits she \"got under the cloud\" after giving birth to her youngest child. \nShe shared: \"I didn't have postpartum the first time so I didn't understand it because I was like, 'I feel great!' \n\"The second time, I was like, 'Oh, whoa, I see what people talk about now. I understand'. It's a different type of overwhelming with the second. I really got under the cloud.\" \nAnd whilst the 40-year-old star hated how she was feeling at the time, she looks back on it positively as it helped her take \"one thing at a time\". \nShe added: \"It's really important. I was in the kids' class with Frankie and Olive this morning and I started fretting about some piece of work news that was just stressful. \n\"You know, in like the Broadway Babies class and it's the one-hit wonders day, and they're singing I don't even know what song, and we're all doing our lollipop drums and I just thought, 'Save it until after class.' One thing at a time.\" \nDrew admits she made a lot of changes to suit her new life as a parent and couldn't be more thankful about the blessings she has been given. \nShe added to PEOPLE magazine: \"I just got right on the idea of, where do I need to be the most? Fifty-fifty would be ideal but life doesn't work like that. Life is messy. \n\"It was just really challenging and I felt overwhelmed. I made a lot of decisions and I definitely changed my work life to suit my parenthood.\" celebrity", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:20:24.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
