He was 78. \nHis wife, the writer Delia Ephron, said Kass died Thursday of prostate cancer at his home in Manhattan. Kass was also the brother-in-law of the late screenwriter and director Nora Ephron. \nKass co-wrote the screenplay for the 1983 telefilm \"The Black Stallion Returns\" and the TV mini-series \"Evergreen.\" His other film credits include \"The Fighter,\" ''Last Wish\" and \"A Brand New Life.\" \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to show that Kass was a brother-in-law of Nora Ephron, not a sister.
