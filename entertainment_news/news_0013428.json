The center’s new addition on the Humboldt Street side of the 14-acre site still is being finalized but not only adds more dining choices to the complex’s growing list of eateries but also a boutique, clothier and hairstylist. “We have a broadened set of options for shoppers now,” said Alexis Khazzam, owner of Junction Ventures, the firm that took over ownership of the shopping center in 2006. Along with the new addition, Junction City has seen plenty of other changes this year. The Bushwhacker outdoor store opened in May near the Rock Island Trail that overlooks the center, while Preckshot Pharmacy plans to open an expansive wellness complex on the premises later this month. “We’re very selective about our tenant base. We’ve said no to businesses that would have benefited us financially but would not have been of benefit to the center,” Khazzam said. “Synergy is the most important thing we can offer, and we have that with a good mix of tenants. “We try to attract locally owned businesses. We don’t take that lightly.” Junction City’s addition will feature two new restaurants, Hacienda El Mirador, a Mexican restaurant, and Childers Eatery, a second outlet from the owners of the popular bistro that continues to serve customers at 3312 N. University St. Other new stores include the Pink Sugar boutique, the Britches & Bloomers clothing store that makes its return to Junction City, where it started years ago, and Duke Design, a hair studio that’s already open at the site. The two new restaurants, expected to open in November, along with the Asia Grille, Brienzo’s Pizza, Cyd’s, Edge and the Fin 13 Sushi Grill and Lounge (opening later this month), bring the number of eating places in the center to seven. The new addition also comes with a brick boardwalk and will feature a walkway connecting it to the corner section of Junction City known as the Town Hall. “Next year, the Town Hall will feature retail stores on the first level,” Khazzam said.
