Jem set a dubious record: the worst debut ever for a film playing on more than 2,400 screens. \nThe Martian was the number-one movie with 15.9 million dollars, displacing the previous box office champ, Goosebumps , which made 15.5 million. \nHere are the top 10 movies from Friday through Sunday, with estimated ticket sales, according to Rentrak: \n1. The Martian , $15.9 million2. Goosebumps , $15.5 million3. Bridge of Spies , $11.4 million4. The Last Witch Hunter , $10.8 million5. Hotel Transylvania 2 , $9 million6.
