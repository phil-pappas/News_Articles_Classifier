For the fascinating thing about Ampersand Wine Bar, which has been in business for nearly three months in Ravenswood, is that the kitchen, very limited in space, has no gas, no woodburning grill, no open flame of any kind.\nAnd yet the flavors that Havidik coaxes out of that tiny kitchen carry so much richness and depth, you'd never guess the chef was working under any restrictions at all.\nI suspect Havidik's experience at iNG comes in very handy, because iNG's founder, the late Homaro Cantu, embraced everything except standard cooking. A little induction heat here, some sous vide there and a working oven seem to be all Havidik needs to create magic.\nThe menu is divided into four categories. Nominally, these are appetizers, mains, sides and desserts, but the plates in the first two categories are pretty much equal in size (and in price; nearly everything falls into the $10-$15 range, and the top price is $18). Sides are less expensive at $6, but function as de facto vegetarian starters, particularly the roasted fingerlings and artichokes under flat flakes of grana padano. Think of each plate as a larger-than-average appetizer, and plan your meal accordingly.\nSalads are a strength; I have fond memories of the burrata, arugula and duck-prosciutto combination I had a month ago (bring this back, please), but there's also a very good Lyonnaise-style salad, sporting a yolky sous-vide egg and a few surprise supremes of orange; and a hearty pickled-beets salad, served in a deep bowl with farro, sunchoke chips and shaved Brussels sprouts. A composition of delicata squash, fresh ricotta and 'nduja sausage deftly applies sweet, savory and spicy notes. My favorite is the kale and quinoa salad, which sounds like the result of a Whole Foods shopping-cart collision but, abetted by a roasted garlic dressing, is absolutely delicious.\nMore substantial dishes include garganelli pasta with mushrooms and tallegio cheese sauce, a rich dish that should be comforting customers well into the winter. A glistening piece of beef short rib, daubed with a Calabrian chili sauce, leans against a tricolor mix of pickled cauliflower over cauliflower puree. Long pieces of pork-belly confit benefit from Asian accents, including kohlrabi and sesame slaw, and crispy chicharrons dusted with togarashi and furikake.\nThe one disappointment was the chicken torchon, new to the menu; the pounded-and-rolled chicken with savory bread pudding should be a fall-weather star, but what I was served was too bland and too dry.\nAndrew Hickey, formerly pastry chef at The Elysian, produces very pretty and creative desserts, notable for not-the-usual-suspects ingredients. Rum-poached quince and pineapple play with muscovado-flavored mascarpone, white-chocolate croutons and sesame brittle; toasted buttermilk cake, lemon curd and soft, scorched meringue unite in a caught-in-a-whirlpool presentation. A previous visit found a strawberry shortcake parfait, enhanced with basil syrup; at present there's a trifle-like butterscotch pudding, served in a glass jar and topped with clementines and a dramatic kettle-corn tuile.\nBar manager and sommelier Victoria Vanourek, previously with Browntrout and Prosecco, runs a mean beverage program, which includes some very good cocktails (the gin-and-mango Ampersand is particularly good), a few craft beers and ciders and a budget-friendly wine list that peaks at $55 and offers single-digit glass pours. The list is dominated by Old World wines, but Vanourek is as friendly and approachable as they come, so by all means take advantage of her expertise.\nService overall is very good here, but it's worth noting that Vanourek recognized me the second I hit the door.\nThe dining space is cozy — the entire restaurant takes up just 1,200 square feet — but comfortable. A few two-seat tables line up along the front window, and there's room for 15 at the bar. Two large communal tables in back bring the capacity to 40. There's almost no waiting space, so even though reservations aren't essential during the week, I'd call ahead every time.\nAlso worth noting is that the absence of open fire doesn't mean the absence of cooking smoke, and Ampersand's ventilation isn't always up to the task. Leave your dry-clean-only outfits in the closet.\nVettel is a Tribune critic.\nAmpersand Wine Bar\n4845 N.
