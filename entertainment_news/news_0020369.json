She alleges her attacker — who she labelled “a monster”— tried to kidnap her before she was brutally assaulted. \nOn social media, she wrote the following message to friends. \n“Wasn’t going to do this but I am because I’m truly sickened to my stomach and believe people need to know that this boy is a monster.

Source: Facebook \n“This boy will not get away with what he’s done to me and my life.” \nA friend of Ms Baker told the Mirror her attacker “couldn’t cope with seeing her on The X Factor and became very violent. \n“Chloe was enjoying a night out with a group of her closest friends when this guy saw her and ­approached. He managed to get her into his car and she was attacked. \n“She had to go to hospital because the injuries were ­serious. She’s a lovely girl and didn’t deserve this. It’s put a real dampener on what has been a lovely ­experience for her. She’s very proud of how well she did on the show and didn’t deserve this.” \nMs Baker narrowly missed progressing to the pointy end of the talent show last week. She was eliminated on Sunday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T11:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:22:11.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
