The delays could be 40 to 45 minutes (round trip) per day, he said. \nDuring construction, there will be a detour that uses Harpers Ferry Road and Route 65 (Mercer Road). The length of the detour is listed as 6.6 miles, according to Plenary Walsh Keystone Partners. \n“We (the district) prefer the project starts in the summer,” Anney said. \nThe project is scheduled to begin as soon as March 2016, Daniel Galvin, public information officer for Plenary Walsh Keystone Partners, said during a North Sewickley Township Supervisors meeting on Oct. 13. Replacement, through the Pennsylvania Rapid Bridges Replacement Project, would take four to five weeks to complete, Galvin told supervisors. \nAnney said he was in touch with Galvin on Wednesday and Galvin said he would contact PennDOT to possibly delay the project. \nThe bridge is presently down to one traffic lane, and it was placed on a PennDOT list of bridges that need immediate replacement, Galvin said. After an inspection, though, it was determined that the bridge is safe to travel across, just that part of the facade had given away, Galvin said during the supervisors’ meeting. \nIn other news, Anney said after the school board meeting that a flashing school speed limit sign along Country Club Drive near Riverside Memorial Stadium has been operational since Friday. \nThe first steps for installing the lights began with a traffic study in early 2014 by North Sewickley Township Police Chief Jeff Becze. The cost of the lights totaled $24,229, and the work was performed by Traffic Systems and Services. The Riverside School District and the township shared equally in the cost.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T06:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:45:28.097+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
