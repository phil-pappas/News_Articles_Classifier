If found guilty, she may face five years in prison, a fine of $250,000 or both.\n\"Criminal prosecution is appropriate when debtors corrupt the bankruptcy process through deceit and lies before the court,\" U.S. attorney David J. Hickton said.\nAccording to the report, the Lifetime television personality, known for her \"tough love\" approach when coaching young dancers, allegedly hid over $700,000 in assets from the Trustee and creditors in order to restructure her dance studio in 2010.\n\"Federal bankruptcy proceedings can be a lifesaver for honest individuals overwhelmed by debt resulting from any number of legitimate reasons, but allegations of fraud and abuse threaten the integrity of the bankruptcy process and the public's trust in it,\" said Special Agent in Charge Scott S. Smith of the Western Pennsylvania's F.B.I. division. \"We take our responsibility to pursue allegations of bankruptcy fraud seriously.\"\nMiller's Dance Moms is a Lifetime hit show and led to a spin-off show and clothing line. Her provocative personality has made the show one of the network's most popular and most controversial. According to reports, Miller was sued twice for alleged assault but both cases were soon after dismissed.\n Former Chicago schools CEO pleads guilty to corruption Teresa Giudice staying involved with daughters from behind bars Maksim Chmerkovskiy bashes former 'Dancing With The Stars' partner Hope Solo", "external_links": ["https://facebook.com/unitedpress", "http://www.justice.gov/usao-wdpa/pr/reality-tv-performer-charged-defrauding-bankruptcy-court-hiding-assets-and-lying-about", "https://twitter.com/Abby_Lee_Miller/media", "https://www.facebook.com/UnitedPress", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/style-blog/wp/2015/10/14/dance-moms-star-abby-lee-miller-indicted-for-fraud-the-latest-reality-star-with-money-problems/"], "published": "2015-10-14T23:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:18:56.635+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
