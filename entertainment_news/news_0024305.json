Rumors about Ari's love life have since died down, but a sneaky pic Ari posted to her Instagram last night has her fans freaking out.\n The pic shows two people hidden behind a curtain, and all you can see is their feet peeking out at the bottom. One person is wearing a pair of white high heels (we can probably assume it's Ariana) and the other is wearing high-top sneakers, and the way they're standing suggests that they may be kissing.\nAri captioned the romantic pic, \" â€‹the sun is setting and you're right here by my side ðŸ’­ðŸŒ™âœ¨ â€‹\"\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail Obviously, the insta sent Ari's fans into a frenzy wondering who she's behind that curtain with, which is probably why she swiftly deleted it.\nSo who could it be? Could Big Sean have stopped by to reconcile with Ari? (Prob not.) â€‹ Could it be Ricky Alvarez? (More likely.) â€‹Or is it a whole new person we don't know about yet? (Possibly.)\nMaybe Ari posting this pic shows that she's getting closer to being ready to go public with her new flame. Then again, she deleted it, so maybe not.
