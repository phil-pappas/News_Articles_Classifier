Wright Stadium and beat Benedictine 35-28.\nThe Cadets bounced back from the setback in the best way possible — as BC made a run through the 2014 Class AA playoffs to win the first state football title in school history with a victory over Greater Atlanta Christian in the Georgia Dome.\nBut Cadets coach Danny Britt has a competitive streak like few others, and he recalls the loss to Vidalia like it was yesterday. Tonight, the Cadets will have a chance for revenge when they travel to play the Indians at Buck Cravey Field in Vidalia with kickoff set for 7:30 p.m.\n“That was the only loss we’ve had at home since we started playing at Savannah State,” said Britt, whose squad has won 14 straight games overall since facing Vidalia. “And we have certainly reminded the players about that game. It wasn’t a fluke; it wasn’t like they got a lot of breaks to win that one. They physically whipped us and embarrassed us with everything on the line.”\nVidalia won the Region 2-AA title and reached the quarterfinals off the playoffs, where they were knocked off by GAC. The Indians (4-2, 2-1 in region) have a shot at another region crown if they can beat BC (6-0, 3-0), ranked No. 1 among Class AA teams by the Georgia Sports Writers Association.\n“We’re the two favorites to win the region, an whoever wins this game will be in the driver’s seat,” Britt said.\nBC is coming off a 48-0 win over Jeff Davis as running back Tyleek Collins had a career night with 210 yards rushing and four total touchdowns. The speedy sophomore leads the team with 604 yards rushing and six touchdowns.\nJunior Wesley Kennedy has 501 yards rushing and eight scores on the ground as the Cadets have racked up 310.5 yards rushing per game.\nSophomore quarterback Nick Iannone hasn’t had to throw much, but he has been effective in the passing game — completing 57 percent of his passes for 800 yards with seven touchdown passes and just two interceptions. Kennedy is his favorite target with 15 catches for 379 yards and three scores.\nThe offensive line has been solid behind the play of senior Sanders Creech, and juniors Matthew Nyce and Gage Blackston.\nVidalia lost some star power, such as quarterback Jordan Black, to graduation. And Nathan McBride, the highly recruited junior linebacker, won’t play. He is expected to be out for the season after breaking his wrist in a preseason car accident.\nStill, the Indians are solid offensively behind fullback Jadarius Mclendon. Lakia Henry and Keshawn Williams are two-way standouts at linebacker and running back.\n“Coach (Lee) Chomskis runs a great program over there,” Britt said. “Injuries have hurt them this year, but they are deep and strong.”\nThe BC defense has been strong as well, behind the play of standout linebacker Tru’Self Cooper. The Georgia Southern-commit is averaging 13.2 tackles per game. Senior defensive lineman Noah Johnson and junior defensive back Philip Moore have become leaders on a unit that has allowed an average of 16 points per game, with a pair of shutouts in the last three contests.\n“We’re excited to play on the road in front of a big crowd,” Britt said. “It’s going to be a great, playoff-type environment.”", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-15T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:14:21.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
