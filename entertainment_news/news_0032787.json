Soraya Nadia McDonald The Washington Post Can a podcast like \"Serial\" translate into TV? \nChristopher Miller and Phil Lord, the directing team behind films like \"21 Jump Street\" and \"The Lego Movie,\" are bringing the wildly popular \"Serial\" podcast to television. \nTogether with Fox 21 Television, the studio behind \"Homeland,\" Miller and Lord have optioned the rights to the podcast from longtime \"This American Life\" contributor Sarah Koenig. They plan to tell the story of producing a podcast that basically went viral. \nAfter the enormous success of the Peabody award-winning first season, the big question is how on earth \"Serial\" will top itself. Multiple outlets have reported that the podcast will focus on Bowe Bergdahl as its subject for Season 2. \nIn choosing to tell a story about telling a story, Miller and Lord will eliminate some of the angst that might have arisen if they were simply adapting \"Serial\" for television. The chances that it will turn into a hipster procedural lower significantly. \nThat's an important distinction. \nPart of what made the first season of \"Serial\" so addictive was the way it isolated you with your thoughts and left you free to visualize what Koenig was reporting and the conversations she had with the people in Adnan Syed's life. The fact that the audience wasn't being fed visuals - aside from the ones being provided if you went hunting for them on the \"Serial\" website - forced you to pay attention in a way that television often does not. You couldn't rely on scouring a screen for clues that a person might be lying based on their facial expressions or their body language.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:47:44.334+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
