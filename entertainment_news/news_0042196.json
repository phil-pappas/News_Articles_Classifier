A video posted by Jonathen Liu (@jonathenlewd) on Oct 8, 2015 at 5:11pm PDT \nJonathen Liu posted a video on Instagram of two rats on subway tracks in a tug-of-war over a slice of pizza, which was first noticed by Gothamist . \"I win today, interwebs,\" Liu boasted about his video. \nOn Reddit, user Bebedvd posted an image of another rat chowing down on a slice on the tracks of the Queens-bound N, R with the caption \"I spotted a celebrity in the subway in Union Square.\" \nThey all appeared to be plain slices, just like the original pizza rat who won the hearts of New Yorkers last month when a video was posted of him trying to drag a full slice down the staircase of the L train, but giving up near the bottom. \nThe comedian who captured the viral video said the rodent symbolized what many New Yorkers experience living in the big city. \n\"You’re carrying too much and you have to go too far and there’s always a lot going on,\" Matthew Little previously told DNAinfo New York. \n\"He’s not the hero that New York City needs,\" Little continued, \"he’s the hero that New York City deserves.\" \nThe Pizza Rat sensation spun off at least two video games , a theme song and a mention by Miley Cyrus in her opening monologue on \"Saturday Night Live.\" \nWhile the desire for more Pizza Rat is obvious, it's unclear why people keep throwing perfectly good slices of pizza on subway tracks. At least the rats aren't using a fork and knife to eat them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:43:32.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
