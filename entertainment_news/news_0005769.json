Before we launched the Executive Education Navigator, that's what people had to do,\" said Adam Ingberman , VP of Product Development for The Economist Careers Network. \"Now, all you have to do is type the topic you want to learn about, hit enter and filter results by anything from location to price to course length. What used to take days to achieve now takes seconds.\"\nSince the platform's launch in July, hundreds of thousands of professionals have used the search site, which helps users search and filter through more than 3,000 courses.\nAbout the Executive Education Navigator ( execed.economist.com )\nLive at execed.economist.com , the Executive Education Navigator is a first-of-its-kind search and discovery destination that simplifies the search process for people who are looking for the right executive education .\nAbout The Economist ( economist.com )\nWith a growing global circulation (more than 1.5 million including both print and digital) and a reputation for insightful analysis and perspective on every aspect of world events, The Economist is one of the most widely recognised and well-read current affairs publications.\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151014/276905LOGO\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/back-to-school-for-busy-professionals-with-the-economists-executive-education-navigator-300159752.html\nÂ©2015 PR Newswire.
