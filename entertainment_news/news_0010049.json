(AP) â€” The assistant principal of a school on New York's Long Island is in hot water with the district following her brief turn as an actress in a raunchy rap video. \nNewsday reports (http://nwsdy.li/1OE3bXH ) Southampton High School's Esther Adler-O'Keefe has been reassigned to a new position after she appeared in the video for \"Best Friend\" by rapper J.R. and R&B singer Trey Songz. \nSuperintendent Scott Farina says Adler-O'Keefe will now oversee \"a variety of academic support services throughout the district.\" \nIn the video, Adler-O'Keefe plays a woman going on vacation with her husband. Hired as the house sitter, J.R. throws a massive party boasting a bevy of drugs, alcohol and scantily-clad women. \nFarina said the district was unhappy with Adler-O'Keefe's participation. \nAdler-O'Keefe didn't immediately return calls seeking comment. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:46:27.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
