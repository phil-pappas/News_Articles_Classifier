The product segments covered include adhesives and sealants, and elastomers. Unit shipment and revenue forecasts are provided at a regional level for each segment for the period 2011 to 2021. \n\nAt the segment level, the analysis focuses on the market dynamics in North America , Europe , Asia-Pacific , and the Rest of the World, and provides regional-level application splits for each product segment. Unit shipment by chemistry is provided in the elastomers segment for high consistency rubber (HCR), liquid silicone rubber (LSR), and fluorosilicone rubber (FSR). Competitive structure and market share data have been provided for each segment. \n\nKey Findings: \n- The market for silicones in the automotive industry is driven by the growing need for lightweighting and lowering carbon emissions \n- Superior properties of silicones, such as resistance to heat, chemicals, ultraviolet (UV) rays, and corrosion, drive adoption in the adhesives and sealants, and elastomers segments \n- The under-the-hood segment presents significant opportunities for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) as they look to develop smaller engines and implement lightweighting, which results in higher temperatures \n- Silicone elastomers face competition from other elastomers such as natural rubber, ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM), and chloroprene rubber in the automotive industry primarily due to the high costs of silicone elastomers \n\nKey Topics Covered: \n\n1.
