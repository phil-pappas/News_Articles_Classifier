Jimmy Davis performs The Killers song When You Were Young on The X Factor. Channel 7 Cars For Sale \nCOORAN's Jimmy Davis and Melbourne teen Georgia Denton were eliminated from The X Factor tonight. \nWhile Denton has been in the bottom two before, it was the first time Davis has faced elimination on the reality singing show. \nDavis dedicated his final performance of Elton John's Rocket Man on the show to his mum, and biggest supporter, Robyn. \n\"If you're coming into the this thing as an independent artist try to stay true to who you are,\" Davis said. \nHis mentor Chris Isaak added: \"I'm hoping when Jimmy is playing in arenas, he remembers me.\" \nGuy Sebastian cast the deciding vote in Davis's elimination, choosing to give Brisbane-based Kiwi jazz singer Mahalia Simpson another chance. \n\"I feel like you've kind of been scattered all over the place,\" Sebastian said. \n\"Last night... wasn't a home run but it was on the right path.\" \nDenton's mentor Dannii Minogue came under fire last night for her song choices for the teen, while 22-year-old Davis was praised for going back to basics with his acoustic rendition of The Killers' When You Were Young. \nFans of the \"ranga rocker\" took to social media to express their disappointment with his elimination. If Ed Sheeran can make it with just his voice and his guitar, so can @JimmyTheButt ðŸ˜Ž #XFactorAU â€” Sincerely Eddie (@SincerelyEd) October 13, 2015 \nThat was a really puzzling decision from the #xfactorau judges. Jimmy's performance tonight was spine tingling. He should have stayed. â€” Stephen Oxley (@stepox) October 13, 2015 \nâ€” Shawn Is My BÃ† (@CatMendes143) October 13, 2015 \nDavis hopes to record more of his own music and become a touring artist, playing at music festivals including The Woodford Folk Festival. channel 7", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:22:09.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
