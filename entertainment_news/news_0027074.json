It's a title previously held by Scarlett Johansson and Penelope Cruz. \n\"She manages to bring together a number of opposites, to make them natural: sweetness and toughness, emotionalism with a kind of cold-blooded determination,\" the magazine wrote in the accompanying article. \"Something in these contrasts explains her sex appeal, too.
