A petition dated January 26, 1807 documented his many years as a teacher and his work building dams and ditches on his property which is now the Tubac Golf Resort & Spa. Both of these documents are stored in the National Archives Pacific Region and the land grant is the most ancient document in their holdings.\nDiana DeLugan, an eighth generation descendant, will speak on her illustrious ancestor in Otero Hall, a building donated to the village of Tubac in 1914 by Don Torivio's great grandson. The Governor's proclamation encourages visitors throughout the state to discover the rich history at Tubac, \"Where Art & History Meet.\"\nRefreshments will be served. Call 520-398-2252 to make your reservation today. $7.50 fee includes admission to tour the Park.\nThis event is sponsored by Tubac Historical Society, Pimeria Alta Historical Society, and the Friends of the Tubac Presidio and Museum. Tubac Presidio State Historic Park is located at 1 Burruel Street in Tubac, Arizona at Exit 34 on I-19 south of Tucson.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10Otero/prweb13007330.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10Otero/prweb13007330.htm"], "published": "2015-10-08T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:01:46.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
