Image 2 of 2\nWilliams’ stories short — but seldom sweet 1 / 2 Back to Gallery It hurts to read Joy Williams ’ stories, if you’re a dog person.\nIn “The Visiting Privilege: New and Collected Stories,” dogs fall off ferries at night. They have plastic baskets on their heads, or nasty warts. They have Grecian Formula rubbed into their prematurely graying snouts.\nSome are given stupid names that make them seem “transitory, even doomed.” Others are unnamed. When they run away, there’s nothing to yell.\nThey are unloved and, in a phrase of the author’s, uncertain about their duties. I began to wince when a new one showed up, tail wagging.\nIt tells you something about Williams’ stories that the people generally fare worse than the dogs.\nMore Information The Visiting Privilege: New and Collected Stories\nBy Joy Williams\nKnopf, $30\nHer men and women are afflicted in all the classic horrible ways, the old tunes from the American Songbook of thunk and thud (divorce, cancer, poverty, depression, car collisions, children who despise them), not that we Americans have anything like copyright on these numbers. Others characters are tormented in fresh ways of the author’s devising.\nIt tells you even more about Williams’ stories to note that, despite and perhaps even because of all of this, they are unbelievably funny. The mental heat they give off places them at the far end of the Scoville scale. “The Visiting Privilege” is a 50-course, full-tilt tasting menu of misanthropy and guile.\nWilliams is the author of four novels, perhaps most notably “The Quick and the Dead” (2000), a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, as well as four previous story collections and two volumes of nonfiction. She is 71. “The Visiting Privilege” solidifies her position as a thorny American writer of the first rank.\nIn a recent profile of Williams by Dan Kois in The New York Times Magazine , George Saunders got at her unique contribution to the American short story, her way of “taking the tight, minimal Carveresque story and showing that you could retrofit it with comedy, that particularly American brand of funny that is made of pain.”\nTo put it in a slightly different way, Williams smuggles some of the poison wit of writers like Lorrie Moore and Lydia Davis into her stories, while also hitching them to the laconic, high-plains muscle of writers like Thomas McGuane , Jim Harrison and Robert Stone .\nNot a lot happens in a Joy Williams short story. A standard mise-en-scène might be (don’t hold me to every detail, I am going by feel): Dishes in the sink of a rented house; weeds in the parched Florida lawn; a scratchy Neil Young record playing somewhere; a lanky, freckled, unhappy couple draining a third pitcher of cheap margaritas, the tendons in their necks twitching.\nOne of their two children (each from a previous marriage) is dead; an elderly parent has collapsed in a nursing home. They’ve recently hit a deer with the car. They have a dog named Peaches whom everyone wants to kick. If a hummingbird comes around — this happens, in one story — one of them will whack it with a book.\nThe vibe is real and surreal. The dialogue adds to the flayed effect. Williams is a master of the non sequitur as emotional signal flare. Out of the blue, her characters utter things like: “I dreamed that I threw up a fox”; “Clouds aren’t as pretty as they used to be”; “I can’t bear to go to another restaurant and see the sneeze guard over the salad bar”; “The variations in our life have ceased to be significant”; “Genuine thinking is rare.”\nPiling up lines and details can make her stories sound brittle, random, half-felt. They are not. This is a writer who sees deeply into the hearts of things. All the world’s woe pools below her sentences.\nWilliams’ stories transmit a deep feeling for life’s transience, a sense that everything is provisional and thus tragicomic. Her people are not much on maintenance, moral or otherwise. They have no backup systems. Once upon a time, they might have had tennis lessons and orthodontia, but their own children probably will not.\nA woman in the story “The Little Winter” is described as “tall and disheveled,” a person who “looked the very picture of someone who recently had ceased to be cherished.”\nMore often, humor and cruelty are crushed into a fine blend. A father says to a boy about his 10-year-old daughter: “Jane will not have friends. Jane will have husbands, enemies and lawyers.”\nSo much of the dialogue here put me in mind of an immortal line of Carver’s, in which a woman intones, “Honey, no offense, but sometimes I think I could shoot you and watch you kick.”\n“The Visiting Privilege” includes 13 new stories, which are very much in keeping with the old ones. The sound they make is one of sanity under torment.", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/15/62/8707237/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/15/62/8707237/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/15/62/8707236/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/15/62/8707236/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-03T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:31:13.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
