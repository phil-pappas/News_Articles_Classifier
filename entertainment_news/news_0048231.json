Reserved seating tickets, $27, are on sale now, and are available online at phtww.org or by calling the box office at 509-529-6500. Orson Welles is an American legend who lived large and changed the landscape of the American stage and cinema. From his legendary radio production of “War of the Worlds” to his best-known film, “Citizen Kane,” to his much-publicized battle with tycoon William Randolph Hearst and his considered run for Wisconsin senator against Joseph McCarthy, Welles made the most of his life as a social maverick. His radical stage direction of Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar” and “Macbeth,” as well as his pro-union production of “The Cradle Will Rock,” were at the forefront of performance innovation. These stories and all of Welles’ fabled escapades are packed into “Rosebud: The Lives of Orson Welles,” a lean, 90-minute show by actor Erik Van Beuzekom. The show hinges on Van Beuzekom’s credibility. His deep-voiced, rakish Welles is a witty narrator, by turns charming, hilarious and chilling. “Rosebud: The Lives of Orson Welles” won the Best of Edinburgh Award as well as The Carol Tambor Edinbugh to New York Award in 2005. This production has mature themes and is suitable for high school age and up. For more information about upcoming events at the Gesa Power House Theatre, visit phtww.com.
