Quaid taken into custody in Vermont trying to cross border In a photo provided by the Vermont State Police, Evi Quaid stands in the Vermont State Police barracks in St. Albans, Vt., Friday, Oct. 9, 2015. Quaid and her husband, actor Randy Qaid, were taken into custody Friday while trying to cross from Canada into the United States. Randy Quaid is wanted in Santa Barbara, Calif., to face felony vandalism charges filed in 2010 after he and his wife were found squatting in a guesthouse of a home they previously owned. The two skipped several court appearances and went to Canada, where Evi Quaid was granted citizenship.
