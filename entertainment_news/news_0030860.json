The news is not unexpected - several sources had reported that Odom had taken several drugs , including crack cocaine and herbal sexual enhancements, during a three-day stay at a legal brothel in Nevada. However, according to TMZ, the Nye County Sheriff had previously stated that, if Odom tested positive for cocaine, it's likely that he'll face drug charges. Odom was found unconscious at the brothel on Oct. 13 and spent several days in a coma. The NBA star is currently recovering in Los Angeles and his estranged wife, Khloe Kardashian , has called off their divorce , reportedly on the condition that Odom stop using drugs.
