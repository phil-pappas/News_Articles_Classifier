According to The Hollywood Reporter , the 25-year-old actress has just dropped out of \" The Rosie Project \", but at the same time, she is in early talks to star in an untitled Darren Aronofsky project. Lawrence was set to star as the titular character in \"The Rosie Project\". Scott Neustadter and Michael Weber wrote the script of the movie which is based on a book by Graeme Simsion. The story follows a socially-inept genetics professor who devises a very detailed survey in order to find the perfect wife. His plan turns to different direction when he encounters Rosie (Lawrence), a free-spirited woman who possesses all the opposite qualities he should be looking for. Phil Lord and Chris Miller were tapped to direct before the two departed for another project. Richard Linklater then came aboard to direct. Sony's Tri-Star Pictures still considers \"The Rosie Project\" a priority with hopes to find a replacement for Lawrence soon. Meanwhile, Variety brings words that Lawrence has been eyed to star in Aronofsky's mystery indie project. Plot details and cast members have yet to be announced and there is no word yet on whom Lawrence will play. The director hopes to begin shooting this spring. Aronofsky recently eyed an untitled Evel Knievel biopic at Sony with Channing Tatum starring, but has since moved on. As for Lawrence, she will next be seen in \" The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 2 \" and Fox's \" Joy \" before appearing as Mystique in next year's \" X-Men: Apocalypse \". \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More The Rosie Project News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T05:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:12:00.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
