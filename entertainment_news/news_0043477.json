Related Media EAGLE — Catherine Zeeb, local author and healer, is sponsoring the John of God Crystal Chakra Bed, as well as an ionic foot detox, on Saturday and Sunday at High Altitude Spa in Eagle. “This is a very special event,” Zeeb said. “Teresa Arney will be traveling from the Durango area with her John of God Crystal Chakra Bed. I am honored to be able to bring it back to the Vail Valley. I have used it myself and know it provides a wonderful and peaceful healing, no matter what is going on in your life.” Crystal bed A Crystal Bed, also called crystal bath therapy, has seven extremely clear and highly polished Vogel cut quartz crystals suspended approximately 12 inches above the client lying on a massage table. Each of the quartz crystals has been cut to a specific frequency, and each crystal is aligned above one of the seven human energy centers, or chakras. The individual receiving the session rests face up with eyes closed, bathing in the energy. All the individual needs to do is relax, clear the mind of present life situations, let go or even fall asleep. The crystals will do the rest. Joao Teixeira de Faria, internationally known as John of God or Joao de Deus, is arguably the most powerful unconscious medium alive today and possibly the best-known healer of the past 2,000 years. “I do not cure anybody,” he said. “God heals and in his infinite goodness permits the entities to heal and console my brothers. I am merely an instrument in God’s divine hands.” The medium Joao Teixeira has no formal medical training. Instead, he gives over his consciousness and incorporates the spirits of past doctors and saints. These entities give talks, examine the waiting masses and conduct the visible and invisible operations. It is estimated that he has treated, either directly or indirectly, as many as 15 million people during the past 40 years. Foot detox In an ionic foot detox, ions help flush out the toxins that normally take lots of time to exit the body. Similarly, by taking full advantage of the negative ions, you can have a reinvigorated, healthy lifestyle. This is because negative ions can be easily made to enter the body through the feet. Individuals will sit comfortably with their feet in warm water, the ion machine is placed in the water, and as the toxins begin to appear, they will be explained. After a foot detox, individuals notice a feeling of peace, relaxation and possibly some irritation because of the detoxification of the body. “The foot detox is a great way to cleanse,” Zeeb said. “It provides a relaxing and intriguing method of detoxing the entire body. I use it a home on a regular basis.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:25:35.233+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
