And instead of making just adults laugh, this time he's also cracking up kids in his latest film, Goosebumps. It's based on the best-selling young adult book series by author R.L. Stine. \n\"I play R. L. Stine,\" Black explained on Thursday's Good Morning America . \"And the conceit of the movie is that all the creatures and monsters that I've ever written actually exist in real life and they're trapped inside the manuscripts. And when the manuscripts open, out come my monsters that I've written. And the whole movie is me and these kids trying to recapture the monsters by running around town and sucking them back into the books.\" \nThe comedian said his two sons loved one particular monster in the film. \"They were totally obsessed with Slappy, the ventriloquist dummy,\" he revealed. \"And so then when we went to the premiere, both of my boys wanted to be Slappy.\" \nBlack also voices the character of Slappy in the film, as well as the Invisible Boy. \nWhen it comes to what he read when he was younger, Black told GMA he preferred darker fare. \"I really loved all of Edgar Allan Poe's short stories when I was a kid,\" he said. \"It was pretty advanced.\" \nGoosebumps, also starring Oscar nominee Amy Ryan, is out Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:46:19.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
