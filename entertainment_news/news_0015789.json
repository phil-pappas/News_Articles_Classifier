In 1916, near the end of its heyday in the silent era, Essanay Studios commissioned a photoplay of William Gilletteâ€™s great stage success. In his only film performance, Gillette's sly, naturalistic portrayal of the Arthur Conan Doyle sleuth comes through without a speck of Victorian theatrics. The film itself is no classic, but for Holmes aficionados and particularly for Chicagoans it's a fascinating time capsule.
