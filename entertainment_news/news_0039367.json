It will be busy in the Rijksmuseum when these paintings are shown to the public for the first time in more than 50 years.\" \nPijbes said the Rijksmuseum and Louvre will have to work out how often the paintings travel back and forth between the Dutch and French capitals, but stressed they would not be separated. \n\"They are a couple,\" he said of the paintings of man and wife. \"They are two separate paintings, but you should see them as one art work, so it is not possible to show them apart from one another.\" \n____ \nAssociated Press writer Angela Charlton in Paris contributed. \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to show that the portraits were last shown to the public in 1956, not 1877 as the museum spokesman earlier said.
