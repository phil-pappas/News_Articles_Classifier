Image 76 of 76 Fleet Week roars into the Bay Area this week 1  /  76 Back to Gallery Grab your earplugs!\nSan Francisco's Fleet Week and all its patriotic grandeur (and noise) kicks off today and runs through Oct. 12.\nAs the week progresses, the bay will fill up with boats and the sky with planes. The signature event, the Parade of Ships and Air Show starring the Blue Angels, will draw crowds along the city's waterfront Friday, Saturday and Sunday, but locals know the best days to see the U.S. Navy planes' aerial stunts is Thursday, the practice day.\nLeading up to the weekend, you'll find a variety of events around the city including ship tours, a veterans' art show, band performances and military and civilian K-9 demonstrations.\nAn Off-the-Grid festival is new this year with food trucks, live music and displays of military equipment. \"In the past there hasn't been anything else going on at Pier 80 near the ship tours,\" Fleet Week spokesperson Garth Langley said in an interview. \"This year we've added food trucks and music so people can literally spend the entire day down there. This is really a family event.\"\nIn its 35th year, Fleet Week was started in 1981 to recognize the contributions of the men and women who serve in the armed forces. A government shutdown famously forced organizers to cancel the event in 2013. \nHere's a look at Fleet Week highlights for the week.
