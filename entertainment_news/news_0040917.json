He was first admitted following him complaining of chest pain, but the doctors have ruled out any possibility of something severe.\nHis brother-in-law Madhu Bangarappa told us, \"We are hoping for him to be discharged today. He is absolutely fine. The doctors have asked him to take a little rest and slow down his busy routine. On Tuesday, after his angiogram, he couldn't sleep as he was called on by many visitors. He couldn't get rest. On Wednesday, we ensured that he got some rest, once he was shifted to the special ward. He should be resting for a week after getting discharged, before he resumes work. I think this was his body's way of asking him to calm down for some time. The past few months have been hectic, not only because he was shooting and busy with his fitness regime, but he also had his daughter's wedding to take care of. We think that this one-week rest period is also going to be his training regime to calm his routine and give his body some rest.\"\nAs news of Shivarajkumar's ill health spread like wildfire, the actor's fans and friends from the industry made a beeline for the city hospital he was admitted to. The who's who of the Kannada industry, like V Ravichandaran Yash, Prem, Tara , Sudharani, Ragini Dwivedi, Rakshit Shetty and Imran Sardhariya, among others, called on Shivarajkumar, while others spoke to him and wife Geetha over the phone.\nAs the day wore on and the crowds outside the hospital swelled, traffic cops barricaded the area, causing traffic disruptions on the stretch. Several motorists were caught in the jam that took a while to ease. Policemen on duty at the hospital had to resort to a minor lathi charge to disperse the crowd. NS Rajkumar, who handles the family's home productions, got caught in the melee.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:11:54.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
