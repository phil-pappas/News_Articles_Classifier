The Lake County Sheriff's Office announced on Friday that a $2,000 reward was being offered by the victim's family and Lake County Crime Stoppers for information that leads to the conviction of the driver that killed Spicak.\nDetective Christopher Covelli, sheriff's office spokesman, said the collision undoubtedly damaged the vehicle — which also knocked down several nearby mailboxes — and he asked the people who live in that area to take a look at each other's vehicles. Also of note: anyone who has bought a new car since Oct. 12, Covelli said.\n\"A big part of it is community involvement and awareness,\" Covelli said. \"That's something we'd want to know about.\"\nCovelli said that sometime before 11 p.m. Oct. 12, Spicak was near his mailbox when the passing car hit him. Responding deputies found him lying unresponsive in his ditch, Covelli said, and doctors at Advocate Condell Medical Center in Libertyville declared him dead.\nSpicak owned a residential construction firm based out of Lake Forest. His family has not returned calls for comment.\nCovelli said evidence at the scene indicated that the car had been traveling west, and that investigators suspect the driver was coming from the Horatio Gardens subdivision. He also noted that Oct. 12 was a busy night for sports fans: Besides the Monday Night Football game, that was the night that the Chicago Cubs hit six home runs in their 8-6 defeat of the St. Louis Cardinals, in the first-ever postseason game at Wrigley Field between the two rivals.\nPrarire View is an unincorporated area between Buffalo Grove and Lincolnshire. Anyone with information about the incident should call the Lake County Sheriff's Office at 847-548-5200 or Lake County Crime Stoppers at 847-662-2222.\nrwachter@pioneerlocal.com\nTwitter @RonnieAtPioneer\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Traffic Accidents Hit and Run (vehicular)", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562bb90d/turbine/ct-bgc-hit-and-run-tl-1029-20151024", "https://twitter.com/RonnieAtPioneer"], "published": "2015-10-24T19:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:31:23.342+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
