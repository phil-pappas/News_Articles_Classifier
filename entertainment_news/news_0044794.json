Kennedy by William Doyle (William Morrow) in History Buy Now Buy Now Amazon Barnes & Noble Google Play iBooks Indiebound Kobo Zola USA TODAY Rating\nMore than half a century after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the world remains endlessly fascinated by both the man and his presidency.\nBut author William Doyle isn’t wading into the usual waters — JFK’s alleged affairs, conspiracy theories surrounding his death or even his political legacy. Instead, Doyle recounts in impressive detail and with enlightening perspective the history of PT 109, a story of heroism in World War II’s South Pacific starring the future 35th president of the United States Doyle that’s fading fast from the collective consciousness. (It's a story that's been told before, in books and in the 1963 movie PT 109 that starred Cliff Robertson as Kennedy.)\nEven before he commits a word of his own to print, Doyle makes a compelling case for why PT 109 should be remembered, opening this often engrossing combination of adventure and analysis with a Quote: from David Powers, one of Kennedy’s longtime friends and White House aides.\n“Without PT 109,” said Powers, “there never would have been a President John F. Kennedy.”\nDoyle, a 2015-2016 Fulbright Scholar and co-author of the best seller American Gun: A History of the U.S. in Ten Firearms (with the late Chris Kyle), proves his point methodically and cinematically throughout.\nAs the commander of the U.S. Navy patrol torpedo boat PT 109, Doyle reasons, the 26-year-old JFK was forever transformed over the course of a seven-day ordeal that began on Aug. 2, 1943, and, as a result, so was history.\nJFK in Training: A rare photo of John F. Kennedy (center) at the U.S. Navy PT Boat training facility at Melllville, R.I. (Photo: Frank J. Andruss Sr.)\nOn a mission that appears to have been hopelessly doomed from the start, JFK’s PT boat was rammed and virtually split in two by a Japanese destroyer that emerged through black fog “during a chaotic nighttime skirmish.” Two American sailors were killed on impact, while Kennedy and 10 other survivors found themselves shipwrecked and left for dead in enemy waters. It was, by most accounts, JFK’s exceptional and even “reckless” brand of bravery that made all the difference in their survival. (This included, most famously, a 3 1/2-mile swim through shark-infested waters with JFK towing a severely burned sailor by taking his life jacket in his teeth.)\nThe child of privilege had emerged from the war a selfless, battle-tested leader.\nFor Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., it was the break he’d been looking for and in different ways had tried to engineer — a vessel that would launch JFK (after the death of eldest son Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., on a 1944 flying mission) into political prominence, empower the family dynasty, and lead to the Oval Office. Remarking that “things don’t just happen, they are made to happen by the public relations field,” the Kennedy patriarch promoted, positioned and leveraged his son’s profile in courage and “helped propel him into the House of Representatives, the Senate and the White House.”\nAuthor William Doyle. (Photo: Peter Hubbard)\nPerhaps most revealing and affecting in PT 109 are the insights into JFK’s view of the event, the military, his connection to his men and his desire to reconcile with his former enemies. “I firmly believe that as much as I was shaped by anything, so I was shaped by the hand of fate moving in World War II,” he once wrote.\nCombining original interviews with declassified documents and other materials from the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, wartime archives from Japan, Australia and the Solomon Islands as well as a long-lost 1946 firsthand account by JFK, Doyle’s work has all the makings of a definitive account — the last word on the story.\nAnd as such, it’s a tale few are likely to forget.\nPT 109: An American Epic of War, Survival, and the Destiny of John F.
