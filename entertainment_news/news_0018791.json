The NYPD has created a new unit whose sole mission is to rid the streets of guns, officials said Wednesday.\nBut the new Citywide Anti-Crime Team will be nothing like the Street Crime Unit that was disbanded in 1999 after the shocking shooting death of unarmed immigrant Amadou Diallo, officials said.\n“'It's not the same mission as Street Crime. It's very targeted enforcement against people that carry guns and commit violent acts,” NYPD Chief of Department James O’Neill told the Daily News.\n“This is something that we talk about all the time. We know the geography. We know the people involved. So it just makes sense to have a group of seasoned cops and supervisors target those individuals — and that's how we're going to push violence down further than it is now.\"\nThe Street Crime Unit was axed after Diallo was shot 19 times reaching for his wallet by cops from the unit in 1999.\nO’Neill said cops from the new team won’t be jumping out of cars and making street arrests, focusing instead on building cases through evidence gathering.\n“They're not doing jump outs,” O’Neill said. “That's not why we put this unit together. The enforcement is going to be targeted through intelligence.”\nAngus Mordant/for New York Daily News Police officers form a guard of honor for Officer Randolph Holder, who was killed in the line of duty Tuesday night in East Harlem.

No weapons seizures have been reported yet.\nThe new Citywide Anti-Crime team will be an offshoot of the NYPD’s Strategic Response Group, which was formed to focus on counter-terrorism issues and provide a permanent group of cops to deal with crime spikes and trends, officials said.\nThe new unit is composed of two lieutenants, four sergeants and 16 police officers, O’Neill said.\n\"Most of them are either from the Bronx or Brooklyn North Anti-Crime and a lot of what they're going to do is investigative work based on intel gleaned from people we lock up, from data that we have,” O’Neill said. \"These are people that want to be there and are dedicated to this type of work.\"\nAs of Sunday, there have been 1,102 people shot in the city this year, compared to 1,130 during the same period last year, a 2.5% drop.
