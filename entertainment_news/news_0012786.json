He presents himself in a devil-may-care manner onstage but don’t be fooled: he’s a careful craftsman through-and-through. He will be at the M-Shop on Saturday for an outstanding night of music and storytelling. \nMolly McDonald’s book release show at Iowa Music Store \nAmes poet Molly McDonald has been honing her voice for years around town at readings, poetry slams and concerts, and she has self-published a few small-run chapbooks to distribute to friends. On Saturday, she’ll be releasing her first full-length, professionally published book of poems with a reading at Iowa Music Store. Molly has a sharp-minded command of language that allows her to harness funny turns of phrase and seemingly absurd metaphors in the service of both poignant reflections and mind-bending mini-fictions. She has the backbone of Anne Sexton but with the pithy, twisted vision of Jack Handy. Poetic Ames singer-songwriter Ben Witmer will open the show. \nLegendary Shack Shakers at DG’s \nHard-hitting rockabilly thrashers Legendary Shack Shakers will return to Ames tonight for a countrified night of rock’n’roll at DG’s. The band’s frontman, J.D. Wilkes, is renowned for a pugnacious stage presence that matches the unhinged physical performance style of punk icons such as Jello Biafra with a blues-based musical vernacular. The combination is a thriller. Singer-songwriter Joe Fletcher, on tour with LSS, and the superb Iowa R’n’R outfit The Murrays open the show. \nLittle Big Town at Stephens Auditorium \nGrammy-winning pop-country stars Little Big Town will stop in Ames tonight for a catchy, foot-stomping evening of their hits at Stephens Auditorium. \nNate Logsdon is a musician from Ames and frontman for the band Mumfords. He is also the booking manager at DG’s Tap House and president of Maximum Ames Records. Rules for posting comments \nComments posted below are from readers.
