Up in the sky! CBS gets into the superhero — or, more accurately, superheroine — business by turning \"Glee\" alum Melissa Benoist into Krypton’s favorite daughter in this series premiere. The casting around her is smart, with Helen Slater (the 1980s movie \"Supergirl\") and former TV \"Superman\" Dean Cain as her foster parents. \n9 p.m., FOOD NETWORK: Halloween Baking Championship — In the series finale, \"Haunted House Party,\" the final four bakers give it their all as they bake it out in a haunted house-themed cake battle. \n10 p.m., FX: Fargo — In a new episode titled \"The Myth of Sisyphus,\" Floyd (Jean Smart) and the rest of the Gerhardt clan step up their search for Rye (Kieran Culkin), while Lou (Patrick Wilson) takes a trip to Fargo. Elsewhere, Peggy (Kirsten Dunst) overhears a new theory about the Waffle Hut shooter. \n10:01 p.m., ABC: Castle — Ideally, a stay at a resort should be relaxing, but it isn’t for some of those who visit an Old West-themed vacation spot in \"Once Upon a Time in the West.\" After a deceased guest is suspected of having been poisoned, Castle and Beckett (Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic) go undercover to check out the place. They check in as newlyweds — which is no act, since they’ve just attained that status for themselves. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:09:22.221+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
