Bond infiltrates a secret meeting and uncovers the existence of the sinister organisation known as SPECTRE.\nMeanwhile back in London , Max Denbigh ( Andrew Scott ), the new head of the Centre for National Security, questions Bond's actions and challenges the relevance of MI6, led by M ( Ralph Fiennes ). Bond covertly enlists Moneypenny ( Naomie Harris ) and Q ( Ben Whishaw ) to help him seek out Madeleine Swann ( Lea Seydoux ), the daughter of his old nemesis Mr White ( Jesper Christensen ), who may hold the clue to untangling the web of SPECTRE.
