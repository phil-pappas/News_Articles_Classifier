The Nats had a much deeper pitching staff, young slugger Bryce Harper and home-field advantage. But the Giants had a few things going for them too: a strong veteran presence, a couple of recent championships and a shrewd manager in Bruce Bochy .\nLast fall I asked two of Las Vegas’ leading bookmakers, Wynn’s Johnny Avello and MGM’s Jay Rood, if managers factored into the equation when they set betting odds. Both said no.\n“You have to base the odds on who’s playing,” Avello said. “The manager shouldn’t come into play, but sometimes, of course, he does.”\nAnd boy, did managing matter last October in that National League Division Series. After the Giants won a tight Game 1, the Nats were on the verge of taking Game 2. They had a 1-0 lead, their pitcher Jordan Zimmermann was in complete command and they were an out away from a 1-0 victory.\nThen Joe Panik worked a walk, and Washington manager Matt Williams , in his first season at the helm, took Zimmermann out, a decision that still haunts Nats fans. Buster Posey singled off reliever Drew Storen to move Panik to second, and Pablo Sandoval ’s double tied the game. Nine innings later, Brandon Belt’s homer provided the winning run, and the Giants went on to take that series and win their third title in five years.\nSo if you’re seeking an edge for sports betting during the playoffs, look for veteran presence and an experienced manager. This column is being written before baseball’s final four is set, but if I were to wager on a team, I’d look for managers with playoff experience and a long history of savvy decisions.\nOn to the NBA season, which starts Oct. 27: I’m a Warriors fan and worried about the absence of their head coach, Steve Kerr , who took an indefinite medical leave this month to recover from back surgery.\nBoth Wynn and MGM have the Warriors at 4:1 to repeat as NBA champs. That line hasn’t moved since Warriors head coach Kerr left the team this month. “Eighty-two games (plus playoffs) have to be played to determine the champ. It’s way too early to start raising last year’s winner from 4:1,” said Avello, Wynn’s oddsmaker.\nIf Kerr comes back for the opening-night tip-off, the Warriors may be fine. Kerr’s value shouldn’t be underestimated. MVP Stephen Curry is the heart of this championship team, but Kerr is its soul. If he’s gone for a while, it may be painful for the Warriors and harder for them to win another title.\nMichael Shapiro (michaelshapiro.net) is a travel writer and author of “A Sense of Place.” E-mail: datebook@sfchronicle.com Twitter: @shapirowrites", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T13:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:32:26.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
