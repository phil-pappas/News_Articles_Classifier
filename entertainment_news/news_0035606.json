The deluxe edition's adds a few songs, including \"In a Broken Dream,” a 1968 hit made with Australian rock band Python Lee Jackson. \nAlso out this week: Rock/pop — Joanna Newsom, one of indie music's most celebrated and indescribable artists, returns after five years of acting and performing with “Divers”; Judith Hill, one of the unheralded backup singers featured in “20 Feet From Stardom,” debuts with the Prince-produced “Back in Time.” \nPop heartbreakers 5 Seconds of Summer return with “Sounds Good Feels Good”; Depeche Mode singer Dave Gahan has a new solo record, “Angels & Ghosts,\" with his band the Soulsavers, \nHarry Connick Jr. collaborated with producers Eg White and Butch Walker on “That Would Be Me,” which is said to be a departure for the veteran crooner; and speaking of crooning, Andrea Bocelli offers “Cinema,” a collection of songs from movies. \nVanessa Carlton, “Liberman”; Matthew Sweet and Susanna Hoffs, “Completely Under the Covers,” is a four-CD set collecting all three of their celebrated cover albums, with 15 bonus tracks. \n“Cold and Bitter Tears: The Songs of Ted Hawkins” pays tribute to a greatly underrated writer and singer, with covers from Kasey Chambers,Mary Gauthier, James McMurtry, Gurf Morlix, Tim Easton and Sunny Sweeney; Shawn Mullins, “My Stupid Heart.” \nKilling Joke, “Pylon”; Vinnie Moore, “Aerial Visions”; Like Moths to Flames, “The Dying Things We Live For”; Pure Bathing Culture,“Pray For Rain”; Half Moon Run,“Sun Leads Me On.\" \nR&B/hip-hop — Gilla Da Kid, \"Welcome 2 Gilladelphia\"; DJ Khaled, \"I Changed A Lot\"; Wax, \"Livin' Foul.\" \nCountry/bluegrass — Carrie Underwood, “Storyteller”; Kyle Park, “The Blue Roof Sessions.” \nJazz — Kenny Burrell, “The Road to Love.” \nBlues — Walter Trout, “Battle Scars”; Tommy Castro & The Painkillers, “Method to My Madness.” \nChristmas — Band of Merrymakers, “Welcome to Our Christmas Party,” with 3OH!3, Christina Perri, Dan Wilson, Mark McGrath, Nick Hexum and Owl City, among others; Chris Tomlin, “Adore: Christmas Songs of Worship”; The Claire Lynch Band, “Holiday!” \nReporter Jeffrey Lee Puckett can be reached at (502) 582-4160 and jpuckett@courier-journal.com.
