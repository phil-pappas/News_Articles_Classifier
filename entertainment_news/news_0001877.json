Thank goodness. The concert was scheduled to open with Beethoven’s almighty Kreutzer Sonata, follow that with a graceful Mozart Sonata, and end with Brahms’ A major Sonata.\nFrom the moment I heard that, I reckoned the programme was in trouble. The Kreutzer is a colossal sonata: It’s un-followable. It would have wiped the Mozart, as lovely as it is, off the face of the planet: Beethoven does not take prisoners. So the Kreutzer went last, climactically. The changes were for the better, in programme-balance and deployment of content. And there was more. Out went the Brahms A major and in came the same composer’s G major Sonata. Suddenly the programme was alive with complementary moods.\nShare article How late these changes were made I know not - pretty late, to judge from the onstage announcement of the re-ordering immediately before the show. No matter: everything, and performers, I suspect, benefited. It all felt right; and Benedetti and Grynyuk took off to the stars.\nThe ensuing performances gleamed with life and spirit: Mozart’s K377 Sonata (if that was the right one!) had lovely qualities of grace and playfulness, cleanly-played, the Brahms glowed -I melted at the gorgeousness of the slow movement, which was like a soft warm breath - while the stupendous performance of the Kreutzer had wings; and the performers’ nerves held rock-steady in a long hiatus when a member of the audience was taken ill.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-26T07:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T02:13:10.826+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
