The department says by law the studded tires can be used from Oct. 16 through April 30.\nThe tires are intended to provide better traction on ice and snow.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is separately advising drivers keep winter gear in their cars including an ice scraper and snow shovel, cell phone and charger, blankets, jumper cables and flashlight.\nThe agency also suggests ensuring car batteries are well charged and windshield wiper fluid containers are filled.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
