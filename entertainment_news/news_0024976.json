The Walking Dead's dark themes aren't enough to get me to stop watching Comments AMC \nAndrew Lincoln, who stars as former law officer Rick Grimes, is shown in a scene from season 4 of \"The Walking Dead\" on AMC. \nIt's not easy to get me to turn off a football game. \nBetween my near-religious fervor for the Philadelphia Eagles and my obsession with fantasy football, Sunday afternoons in the Schweigert household are generally devoted to the NFL. \nBut last Sunday at 9 p.m., I switched off the (admittedly boring) New York Giants-San Francisco 49ers \"Sunday Night Football\" matchup without a moment's hesitation. \nBecause as much of a football fan as I am, I'm an even bigger geek for \"The Walking Dead.\" \nAnd, apparently, I'm not alone. \nAMC's hit show about a group of people fighting for survival in a post-zombie apocalypse opened its sixth season last Sunday, and once again it was a ratings monster. It was Sunday night's No. 1 show, besting even \"Sunday Night Football\" in the coveted age 18-49 audience group. \nAccording to Variety, the special 90-minute episode was mentioned almost one million times on Twitter, and also generated the largest amount of posts on Facebook. \nThe show's popularity has grown every year. I was on board from the start, having read a few of the graphic novels the show is based on before it aired. \nThe series does a great job of capturing the feel of the books and conveying their central theme — that when you're forced to do whatever it takes to survive, the line between good and evil becomes more and more difficult to define. \nThe show's main character, Rick Grimes, is a former small-town sheriff charged with keeping his small group of family and friends safe as they travel through a world overrun by ravenous, flesh-eating zombies. \nOver the course of the show's five-plus seasons, we've seen that dealing with the undead is just one of the dangers our heroes have to face. \nOften, the more perilous problem is the other survivors Rick's group encounters. Trust in others becomes an increasingly rare commodity, and with good reason. \nFaced with ever-mounting challenges to his survival, Rick has slowly turned from a good, decent man into a cold, pragmatic killer willing to do almost anything to keep himself and his loved ones alive. \nIt's gotten to the point where I'm beginnign to wonder if the show will make the bold choice of turning Rick into a full-blown villain. Even some of his most loyal friends appear to be giving him some side-eye over the recent choices he's made. \nA joyful, uplifting show \"The Walking Dead\" is not. Sometimes it can almost be a chore to watch — especially when one of your favorite characters messes up and becomes zombie chow. \nSo why, then, is it so popular? \nI think it's because the show has a little something for everyone. If you're just into watching zombie carnage, you will rarely be unsatisfied. Every week, a few of the flesh-eaters meet their end, sometimes in truly creative ways. \nWhile it's far from a comedy, there are a few laugh-out-loud moments and funny characters, especially if your sense of humor runs dark, like mine does. \nThere have also been some genuinely touching moments. Ask any fan of the show what the phrase \"Look at the flowers, Lizze\" means and see what kind of reaction you get. \nSome TV critics bemoan the show's poor writing choices, plodding pace and sub-par acting…and not without cause, especially in its early seasons. \nBut over the last two or three years, \"The Walking Dead\" has found its stride. It has evolved into a show you don't want to miss. \nAs the seasons progress, the tension slowly ratchets up until the finales, which have grown more and more explosive. \nAdmittedly, it's not for everyone. When the first ominous notes of the show's theme song play, my wife generally flees the room, telling me to \"Enjoy your zombie show\" as she goes. \nAnd even though it sometimes gets so dark that it feels like a chore to watch, I still do. \nAlong with many others.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T16:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T11:48:58.981+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
