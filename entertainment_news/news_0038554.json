The changes Star Wars Land is bringing to Disneyland reflect much more than the addition of a wildly popular entertainment franchise to a wildly popular theme park; they represent a cultural shift that is affecting theme parks across the country.\nWhen construction begins on Star Wars Land in January, Disneyland will close its Big Thunder Ranch, the Rivers of America and the Disneyland Railroad. Big Thunder Ranch will close permanently, meaning the loss of the barbecue restaurant as well as the petting zoo. The railroad and Rivers of America – including the riverboat, canoes, Tom Sawyer Island and Fantasmic! – will close for at least a year. When they reopen, the river around Tom Sawyer Island and the Disneyland Railroad both will have new routes, to accommodate Star Wars Land on property north of Tom Sawyer Island.\nThose changes have elicited howls of protests from Disney fans online – something that happens pretty much any time Disney announces changes to Walt’s park. But an undercurrent to these protests reflects that cultural shift that is changing priorities in the industry.\nWhat do fans want to see in a theme park? In Walt’s day, Disneyland reflected an optimist’s vision of America and the world around it. On Main Street USA, Walt recreated an idealized version of a small town in the days of his youth. While in Tomorrowland, it was a vision of a promising future.\nThe Disneyland of the 1950s and early ’60s reflected the optimism of the time. America’s middle class was prosperous and growing. New homes were plentiful and affordable. College was cheap. With new interstate highways and growing airlines, travel was becoming easier. We were conquering space and infectious disease, and people really believed that science would lead us to a brighter future.\nToday? Well, life feels very different. The middle class is falling further and further behind America’s rich. Average wages, adjusted for inflation, have been stagnant for decades, while housing prices and tuition have soared. Going into an airport today requires running a security gauntlet once found only in prisons and military bases. Our astronauts have to hitch a ride with the Russians, decades of pollution have fueled a global climate crisis, and an anti-vaccination movement helped spur a major measles outbreak that started at Disneyland.\nThose changes affect popular tastes in entertainment. Today, people flock to watch super hero movies and read dystopian fantasies. Our choices in entertainment reflect our collective desire to escape, if for a moment, the depressing world in which we live.\nTheme parks are reflecting that change, too. In Disneyland’s Tomorrowland, attractions such as Adventure Through Inner Space and Carousel of Progress long ago gave way to fantasy rides such as Star Tours and Buzz Lightyear’s Astro Blasters. Universal has been changing the focus of their studio-themed parks around the world, scaling back attractions that focused on the behind-the-scenes of filmmaking and instead, developing new rides and lands that recreate movie fantasies.\nNow Disneyland is going to cut back acres of naturalistic depiction of the American west in order to clear space to build scenes from a fantasy planet in the Star Wars universe.\nSome fans want to hold on to the Disneyland of the mid-20th century – the one that reflected Walt Disney’s and his generation’s optimism for the world around them. But many more of today’s theme park fans have been voting with their wallets for more escapist fare.\nJust look at what’s happened to those parks that have held onto non-fiction-based attractions, notably the Busch Gardens and SeaWorld parks. Their attendance has been sliding for years, even before the documentary “Blackfish” came out. SeaWorld used to be the No. 2 attraction behind Walt Disney World in Orlando, but lost that in 2010 when The Wizarding World of Harry Potter debuted at Universal’s Islands of Adventure.\nSo when it comes down to making a choice between celebrating the world’s environment or escaping into a magical fantasy, people have made their decision clear: Get me out of here.\nRobert Niles is the founder and editor of themeparkinsider.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:12:23.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
