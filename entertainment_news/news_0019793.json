Until October 25.\nWe have long abandoned the idea that a painted landscape is an objective transcription that an artist makes of a scene.\nSome artists paint landscapes of possession and ownership. For others a landscape may be an expression of a spiritual quest, a place where you can experience the presence of God in nature. Others treat the landscape as a living organism and the artist enters into some sort of a collaborative process with the natural elements to create a self-portrait of the land.  \nJennifer Taylor, \"Inteye-Arrkwe evening 3\". Photo: Supplied \nJennifer Taylor has painted in her native Aotearoa (New Zealand) as well as in the Arrernte country at the spectacular locations of Inteye-Arrkwe (Ross River) and Mpulungkinya (Palm Valley), the latter with the permission of its traditional owners. Last year, when she exhibited some of these paintings in Alice Springs, she felt the need to justify herself for working in such a traditional art form as landscape painting.\nAdvertisement \"There's an emotional pull in terms of relating to country, of using that relationship as a way to understand where I stand. Who's been here before me, what I am doing here, what is our potential in the community for relating to land and to each other? I see landscape as a common ground where lots of those questions can come up. I see it as a deeply political subject and a deeply emotional one. I think of portraying landscape in any way as cross-cultural in itself,\" she said at the time.\nThis exhibition, curated by Helen Maxwell, brings together about 70 of Taylor's paintings, all of which started their existence as \"en plein air\" paintings, that is, created in the open, directly on the spot, with the larger paintings derived from these smaller canvases and executed in the studio. They are conceived of not only as records of place, but also as cultural artefacts, which through this very traditional art form attempt to heal the rift between the land and its traditional owners. In a sense, Taylor's paintings reference the people who live there and the cultural traditions inscribed in the land. Although moody and atmospheric, her paintings are also multilayered accounts of history, memory and country.\n\"Undoolya 4\" by Jennifer Taylor. Photo: Supplied \nI once asked some Central Desert painters why they used only acrylics to paint their sprawling canvases and if they had ever experimented with oils. One artist had tried working with oils, but explained that they simply took took too long to dry and all sorts of sand, dirt and insects get stuck in the surface. Taylor's exhibition consists exclusively of oil on panel and when I looked into the surfaces there was this layering, like encrusted scars of history, something very difficult to achieve with acrylics. \nQuite a number of her paintings are set at dusk and have a haunting quality, as if to say that there is great hurt and sadness in this country and that if you listen quietly the paintings evoke the sense of troubled times.\nThe beauty of landscape art is that it can relate many sorts of information, but in a visual and non-verbal manner.\nIn this exhibition, Jennifer Taylor bears witness to country and allows the country to speak through her art.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T05:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:27:51.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
