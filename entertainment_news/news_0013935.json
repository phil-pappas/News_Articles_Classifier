SPECIAL Dennis Knight The date has been circled on the calendar since prep football schedules were released last summer — and it’s finally here.\nCalvary Day and Savannah Christian meet tonight at Pooler Stadium in a game that has big implications in the race for the Region 3-A (East) title, in addition to the bragging rights on the line between the traditional crosstown rivals.\nCalvary Day (5-0, 1-0 in region) is ranked No. 5 in the latest GHSA Class A Private Power ratings. Savannah Christian (4-1, 1-0) has won four straight since a 15-14 setback in Week 1 against Jenkins. The Raiders are No. 7 in the GHSA power ratings.\n“This is a really big game — it’s just a great rivalry,” said Calvary Day’s standout senior two-way lineman Alex Herndon. “It’s a game that brings out the best in both teams, and it’s going to come down to who wants it more. It’s a matter of pride for the teams, players, coaches and both schools.”\nThe Cavaliers beat the Raiders last year in a defensive battle 7-3. The only touchdown came soon after a 44-yard punt return by Jeremiah Mercer to the SCPS 1-yard line, with Robert Heyward scoring from there.\nBoth teams have graduated key players, and SCPS played without star wide receiver/safety/kick returner Demetris Robertson last year, as the junior sat out the first seven games of the season after transferring from Savannah Country Day.\nRobertson, one of the top recruits in the country, has been a game changer this year for the Raiders.\nHe leads the team with 358 yards rushing and six total touchdowns, while averaging 5.2 tackles a game with two interceptions. And any time Robertson touches the ball as a kick or punt returner, he’s a threat to go the distance.\nFreshman quarterback Jordan Grant has emerged as a playmaker with his athleticism and ability to extend plays. He has rushed for 313 yards and four touchdowns. Junior A.J. Davis is a strong inside runner, with 268 yards rushing and five scores.\nSCPS could get a boost with the expected return of junior fullback Ben Jackson, who has been sidelined with a concussion since the opener against Jenkins.\nThe Raiders are averaging 277 yards rushing, 29 yards passing and 28 points per game.\nDefense is once again a strength for the Raiders, who have allowed 9.2 points a game with two shutouts.\nCalvary Day’s offense also loves to run the ball, as the Cavaliers rack up 298 yards rushing per game, led by junior quarterback Sal Calderon, who has a team-high 519 yards and four scores.\n“Their line is very aggressive and they have a good run game,” said junior Zach Quinney, a two-way lineman for the Raiders. “We need to stop the run first, and that will help us shut down the passing game. We need to win the battle up front, that’s where everything starts.”\nCalderon can also throw the ball well. He has completed 62 percent of his passes for 340 yards and three scores as the Cavaliers average 72 yards passing and 34.4 points per game.\n“We’ve been running the ball well and we can pass it when we need to,” Calderon said. “I think one of our strengths is having a balanced offense, and we’re going to need to play that way against Savannah Christian.”\nCalderon said he was impressed by the Raiders’ speed on both sides of the ball.\n“That freshman quarterback (Grant) is really fast, and then they have Demetris,” Calderon said. “With him back there at safety, you have to be on point with your timing and with the ball when you are passing.”\nA number of freshmen have had a big impact for the Cavaliers. Running backs Jeremy Smith (297 yards rushing, six touchdowns) and Nolan Smith (274 yards rushing and eight scores) aren’t related, but they have become go-to players in the offense. Herndon and his classmate, linebacker Brent Sanders, have led a defense allowing just 4.8 points per game, with a pair of shutouts.\nSavannah Christian leads the all-time series 21-13, but Calvary has won the last two meetings. SCPS’s last win against the Cavs came on a last-second touchdown by Jalen Myrick (now playing at the University of Minnesota) in 2012.\n“This is the last time playing Calvary for our seniors,” SCPS senior linebacker Dylan Harper said. “It’s going to be a playoff atmosphere, but it’s even bigger than that for us. It’s two powerhouse teams from Savannah, and this one is for bragging rights.”", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-08T17:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:59:07.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
