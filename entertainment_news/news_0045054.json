Comment Murphysboro   TV Guide Posted Oct. 12, 2015 at 12:47 PM Updated Oct 12, 2015 at 2:19 PM By TV Guide Posted Oct. 12, 2015 at 12:47 PM Updated Oct 12, 2015 at 2:19 PM Some say love... is Amy Poehler belting out Bette Midler . In a performance that would put many Lip Sync Battle champs to shame, the Saturday Night Live alum surprised fans at Tenacious D 's third annual Festival Supreme Saturday to duet with Jack Black on Midler's classic \"The Rose.\" Poehler's rock star look? Super bohemian, complete with sunglasses, a fur vest and a cigarette, natch. The actress appeared during the comedy portion of the show, but make no mistake, this was no send-up. Poehler's love for Midler is for real and well documented. \"So I first met Bette Midler in my head when I watched the film The Rose in 1979. And since then, her and I have been best friends, in my head,\" she told Vulture last year. \"In my head, she and I travel together, we have cut an album, and we pranked George Clooney. She's the godmother to the children of mine that she has never met, and once , Bette turned to me in a dream and said, 'Amy, you are the most talented person I've ever met. I hate to say this, this kills me, but you're more talented than me. God bless you and I release you to God,' and then she turned into a million doves and flew away.\" Watch her cover \"The Rose\" below.
