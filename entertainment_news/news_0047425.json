Emily answered first. “The pony ride,” she said. “We got to put on a helmet and ride on the ponies. I rode a brown pony. She rode a black pony.” Scarlett said she enjoyed the maze. “We had to use a map because we got lost,” she said. “We were going in circles. Then we went straight. Then we got lost again, but we found a clue so we knew which way to go.” The Pumpkin Maze is open daily from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. through Oct. 31. Del’Osso Family Farm co-owner Susan Del’Osso said she expects 200,000 people to visit the farm between now and Halloween. “It’s so great to see people come out,” Del’Osso said. “Ninety-five percent of the people who come out are with families, and we operate it as a family. We plan it together and we operate it together. It’s definitely a labor of love. It’s a great way to share the whole tradition with everyone in the region.” Until 2007, the Dell’Osso family designed and created the mazes by hand and farm equipment. Now, the family utilizes modern technology, using computers and a GPS system to carve out the sophisticated labyrinths. Another top attraction is the Pumpkin Blaster, which shoots mini pumpkins at targets in the field. The pumpkins travel at 90 mph. Other attractions include the 5,000-square-foot Spooktacular Haunted Castle, the Mystery Tour Ride, the Bucking Pumpkin, the Spinning Pumpkins, the Pumpkin Patch, Pumpkin Patch Princess, the Hay Ride and Kiddie Land. Victor and Dawn Adamson of Oakley attended opening day with their 12-year-old daughter Abigail. They were accompanied by Curtis Woods and his 7-year-old daughter, Isabella. Abigail said she likes to pick out pumpkins. Isabella said she enjoyed the Pumpkin Blaster. “I really liked it because I hit the bell and I won a prize,” she said. Woods and the Adamsons said they’ve been bringing their children to the Pumpkin Maze for years. “They have so much fun, and I like to shoot the pumpkins, too,” Dawn Adamson said. Annie Ragsdale of Linden and her daughter, Hallie, 6, attended the event for the first time. “It’s so fun,” Ragsdale said. Hallie agreed. “My favorite part is the spin-around pumpkin (ride),” she said. Erika Villasenor of Manteca said she has taken her son, 7-year-old Shalim Vazquez, to the Pumpkin Maze for a number of years. “I love this place,” she said. “We come here every year.” — Contact reporter Jason Anderson at (209) 546-8279 or janderson@recordnet.com.
