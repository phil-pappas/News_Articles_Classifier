The 30-second clip brings the audience inside the father-son duo's home as they begin their rituals -- Sanjay turning on the television to watch his favorite hero cartoon, and the father ringing a bell to commence Hindu prayers.\nAccording to Buzzfeed India, the rest of the seven-minute short film, previewed for press several weeks ago, shows Sanjay re-imagining Hindu gods as super heroes. It is the first Pixar film helmed by an Indian-American director and is arguably among the first to delve so deeply into a director's own history.\n Disney to release 'The Incredibles 2' in 2019 'The Good Dinosaur' reimagines history in new trailer 'Sleepy Hollow,' 'Monsters University' to air on ABC Family's '13 Nights of Halloween'", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/222ztGhX4SE", "https://facebook.com/unitedpress", "https://www.facebook.com/UnitedPress", "http://www.wired.com/2015/10/sanjay-super-team-pixar-clip/?mbid=social_fb", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=222ztGhX4SE", "http://www.buzzfeed.com/andreborges/heres-a-look-at-disney-pixars-new-short-film-featuring-an-in#.em7LY248p"], "published": "2015-10-16T21:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:40:35.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
