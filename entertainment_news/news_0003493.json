Handout Buttercup (Robin Wright) along side her true love Westley (Cary Elwes). Previous Next Enlarge (Originally published by the Daily News on September 25, 1987. This story was written by Chris Chase.)\nA little boy (Fred Savage) has flu, and his grandfather (Peter Falk) offers to read to him a book called \"The Princess Bride.\" The little boy is suspicious. \"Is this a kissing book?\" No, says the grandfather, the book has \"fencing, fighting, torture, giants, monsters.\"\nAnd it's true. It's about the beautiful Buttercup (Robin Wright) and her true love, Westley (Cary Elwes). Westley leaves the kingdom of Florin to make his fortune, and is later reported to have been killed by pirates. The forlorn Buttercup becomes the prey of wicked Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon sounding something like James Mason) who plans to marry - and then kill - her, and blame her death on soldiers of a neighboring kingdom, the better to start a war.\nDon't worry about the plot. Westley isn't dead, you see, and he will come home to rescue Buttercup, no matter what he has to go through. Even though it's a lot. First he has to free her from a loony trio of kidnappers, then he has to revile her for her engagement to the Prince. \"Why didn't you wait for me?\" he says. \"Well,\" she answers sensibly, \"you were dead.\"\nNew York Daily News/New York Daily News New York Daily News article on 'The Princess Bride' in 1987. Clive Cootie Scene from movie \"The Princess Bride in 1987. Previous Next Enlarge Westley and Buttercup traverse the Fire Swamp, which is full of flames and quicksand and Rodents of Unusual Size, only to be caught by the henchmen of Prince Humperdinck who fasten Westley to a torture machine, while the Prince forces Buttercup through a marriage ceremony. (Peter Cook plays the Bishop who can't pronounce \"r\" and talks about this \"bwessed awwangement.\")\nThe performances are, for the most part, manic. Mandy Patinkin, an actor not known for humor, is particularly wonderful as Inigo, a Spaniard out to avenge the death of his father at the hands (one of which has six fingers on it) of Prince Humperdinck's sidekick, Count Rugen (Christopher Guest). Patinkin looks like Geraldo Rivera, and his Spanish accent is gorgeous. I also loved Billy Crystal as an ancient wizard named Miracle Max and Carol Kane as his equally ancient wife. And the young lovers are very good-looking, and the whole thing is like \"Prisoner of Zenda\" or \"Robin Hood\" mixed with Monty Python and Mel Brooks. It's fun.\nTags: archives", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:24:50.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
