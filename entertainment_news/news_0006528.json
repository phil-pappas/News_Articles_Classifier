In a statement issued through Crown, the artist said he would describe the \"struggle for individual freedom and self-expression in this old society.\" \nAi often uses his work to draw attention to injustices in China. He also played a key role in designing the \"Bird's Nest\" Beijing National Stadium ahead of the 2008 Olympics, a project he later said he regretted. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:58:57.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
