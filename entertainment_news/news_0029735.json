The former couple has reached a settlement after eight months battling it out in court, exiting the Manhattan Supreme Court on Wednesday, October 21 with smiles on their faces. \"There's peace in the Middle East. It's done. We've settled. We're both very happy about the outcome,\" O'Donnell told reporters. Rounds' attorney William London revealed both parties agreed to \"joint legal custody\" of their adopted 2-year-old daughter, Dakota. \"We're happy with everything,\" London said. \"It's over.\" A smiling Rounds expressed her joy, saying, \"I feel great\". According to PageSix.com, O'Donnell and Rounds chatted amicably after three hours of negotiations. London was overheard telling his client, \"Don't ask for the world. Be reasonable.\" O'Donnell filed for divorce from Rounds in February after more than two years of marriage. The former couple had thrown in a series of nasty accusations at each other during the trials. Rounds was hospitalized in September for a reported suicide attempt. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:48:39.571+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
