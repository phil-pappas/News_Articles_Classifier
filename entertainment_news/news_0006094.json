A phone listed as Marino's has been disconnected.\nMarino, who ran the hospice for hundreds of chronically ill and crippled dogs and cats, was charged with cruelty and neglect after a 2010 undercover investigation by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.\nIn September 2012, after Schneiderman filed a lawsuit alleging financial mismanagement and seeking dissolution of Angel's Gate, Marino said she had an auditor who was working with her bookkeeper to get the hospice's records up to date.\n\"We're late in filing, but there's been no misappropriation of funds,\" she said then. \"Every penny went for the animals' care.\"\nDonations poured in after Angel's Gate was featured on Winfrey's syndicated television show, \"The Oprah Winfrey Show,\" in 2008. In 2009, Angel's Gate won $50,000 in a competition sponsored by Rachael Ray's pet rescue organization. Marino also had an appearance on Martha Stewart's show and was awarded an ASPCA Founders award and a Woman of Distinction honor from New York state.\nBut critics, including several animal welfare and pet rescue groups and former volunteers at Angel's Gate, accused Marino of being an animal hoarder and self-promoter who put on a good face for the media while animals suffered behind closed doors and were denied veterinary care.\nAfter the property is sold and creditors are paid, any remaining funds will be directed to another charity dedicated to animal care and protection, Schneiderman said.\n ", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"], "published": "2015-10-14T22:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:30:11.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
