Timing is everything – getting into a deal early nearly guarantees you'll win. Unlike other solutions on the market that scrape the web or run potential prospects against buyer fit models, our platform uses exponentially more and richer data sources to find buyers that have a need now,\" says Amanda Kahlow , CEO and Founder of 6sense. \"Our customers have the competitive advantage of being the first to know and the first to take action the moment their prospects enter a buying cycle. And they have one platform, versus hundreds of channels, from which to monitor their buyers' journeys. \nMarketers who are still using predictive solutions that rank and score leads based on ideal buyer \"fit\" and limited engagement with their own content assets have become increasingly aware that they are only seeing a fraction of their potential buyers and are only able to score those buyers if and when they make contact. The 6sense predictive intelligence platform solves this problem by opening up the outside world of buyer intent data to its customers.\nThe 6sense Private Data Network monitors billions of buying signals across the web and in places where B2B buyers do their research: search, blogs, publisher sites, advisory services, review sites and more. That time-sensitive activity data is then connected to customers' internal data sources (weblogs, CRM and marketing automation) to give them a full picture of all the buyers that could be considering their solutions, not just the ones that raise their hands. 6sense helps its customers make sure their messages are not only hitting the right audience, but also hitting them at the right time, when they actually have a demonstrated need. \n6sense has garnered significant recognition from press and industry analysts including Forrester, Gartner and SiriusDecisions because of its unique technical approach to connecting anonymous-to-known buyers and uncovering net-new prospects even before  those buyers identified themselves. According to the July 2015 Forrester report, 6sense was positioned as the top \"expert\" among \"predictive modelers\" for its data analysis. \n\"Intent data gives marketing and sales two advantages,\" according to Kerry Cunningham of SiriusDecisions. \"First, it reveals greenfield opportunities that would otherwise be uncontested losses. Second, it diagnoses \"false positives\" or wrong predictions which would keep the sales team chasing dead-end leads.\"\nIn July 2015 , 6sense announced an exclusive partnership with Bombora to provide the industry's first integrated predictive marketing platform – a solution that combines account- and contact-level predictive intelligence to power real-time ad targeting. Other integration partners include Marketo, Oracle Marketing Cloud, Adobe, Salesforce among several others. Partnerships and integrations with other downstream systems are part of what powers the 6sense Central Nervous System from which customers can deploy targeted campaigns by buying stage including: \nWeb personalization Lead nurturing Content syndication Digital display advertising Social media advertising Click-to-chat targeted delivery Account-based predictive marketing Sales development and territory planning and more 6sense customers are reporting exponential revenue growth, cost savings and massive efficiencies based on the power to see and act according to where their prospects are in the buying cycle and even long before that prospect becomes a \"lead.\" Reported customer results from customers using 6sense include:\nLead conversion-to-opportunity rates at 60 times higher than regularly scored leads (Blue Jeans); A 67% reduction in the number of touches required to open sales opportunities (Blue Jeans); Sales-qualified leads had 5x higher-than-average deal size (Cisco);  3 times higher MQL-to-SQL conversion rate, which was 5 times higher than other predictive vendors (Cisco);  86% of revenue in quarter from opportunities that 6sense predicted were in purchase stage (Xactly); Identifying the third largest, net-new customer in the history of the company (Xactly).
