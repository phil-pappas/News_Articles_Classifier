His vocal range was such that he could actually reach the high notes on his cover of Ariana Grande’s “Bang Bang” and Sia’s “Chandelier.” No wonder he has fans all over the world.\nLIZA DIÑO takes a groufie with the concert performers (from left): Giselle Sanchez, Joey G., Aiza Seguerra, Darren Espanto and producer Christine Gonzales\nThe Darrenatics UAE, ranging from teens to grandparents, occupied around 10 rows in front of the stage. Some of them traveled three hours from Dubai to see their idol.\nBackstage, I asked former Side A vocalist Joey G. if his former band is okay with him going solo and he shared, “Side A has been together for 25 years. It was a good journey. They are still my friends we are all happy for each other’s success. They respect my decision and wish me well. That’s what real friends do.”\nDerek made girls go wild when he appeared on the stage. Noticing how he was wearing a rosary, I told him to use it also for prayer and not just as fashion accessory. Derek simply smiled and showed me a tattoo of a cross behind his left ear. He told me, “Don’t worry, I pray. Jesus has done a lot for me.”\nAiza brought his entire band, the Pogi Boys, with her on tour. They performed for an hour and a half playing sweet romantic songs, which she lovingly dedicated to her wife Liza Diño, who also joined the trip.\nNote that Aiza and Liza support lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) couples who feel lost or unaccepted by society. They have just completed the indie documentary film “Traslacion: Ang Paglakad sa Altar Ng Alanganin.”\nLiza shared, “The docu is a spin-off of one of the works of Direk Will Fredo. It started with the CBCP (Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines) commissioning several directors to cover Pope Francis’ arrival in the Philippines. They went on to discuss several points that the Pope will tackle. Among the topics was gender equality, at dalawa kami ni Aiza na kinuha ni Direk Will to talk about the issue, among other interviewees. It was so candid that it inspired the director to pursue another documentary and so the birth of ‘Traslacion.’”\nAfter the concert in Abu Dhabi, I left the group for Dubai to tape an episode of “Karaokray,” which I host. Apparently, a lot of Filipinos and other nationalities watch the program, proving true the saying, “Laugh and the whole world laughs with you.”", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:19:38.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
