And with fellow coed country pop group Sugarland still on hiatus, and another, Lady Antebellum, recently announcing a break, Little Big Town--with albums dating back to 2002, and multiple gold-and-platinum-selling singles within the last few years--is in a good position to fill the arena and amphitheater stages those groups once occupied. \nOn Saturday, it proved its ready for the big leagues, with an efficient, high-energy stage show covering 23 songs across 95 minutes. Supported by a touring guitarist, bassist and drummer, the quartet effortlessly jumped genres, from the whistling whimsy of \"Day Drinking;\" to the gospel-style toe-tapper \"Front Porch Thing;\" to the reggae-pop vibe of \"Pain Killer\" (the title track to its latest album); to the scorching rocker from that same album, \"Things You Don't Think About.\" \nAfter about a minute into \"Things,\" it dawned on me. Karen Fairchild's hair and Technicolor shawl were flowing in the breeze of a fan. There were some hot guitar licks. Typical arena spectacle stuff. \nBut for much of the song, the only instrumentation came from some bass from the kick drum and the spaced-out taps of the tom-tom drum. It was Fairchild's fiery voice--essentially, her voice alone--that made the song rock so hard. \nThe vocals are what made Little Big Town special in the first place, and they wisely remain a focal point, with each member stealing the spotlight for at least one song Saturday. For Philip Sweet, it was for the heartfelt reassurance of \"Bring It On Home.\" Jimi Westbrook brought subtle conviction to \"Your Side of the Bed,\" his brokenhearted duet with his wife Fairchild. Kimberly Schlapman supplied fizzy sweetness to the lovestruck \"Sober.\" And Fairchild, so confident during \"Things,\" sang the group's latest country charttopper \"Girl Crush\" with the painful vulnerability and insecurity the song demands. \nBut the best vocals came when the four voices joined forces; like through the layered treatment at the end of \"Boondocks;\" or the Fleetwood Mac-style harmonizing at the start of \"Bones;\" or with an intimate, completely a cappella cover of \"Jolene.\" And those voices also came together at the end of the night for a new, unreleased song where the band gave thanks for all the support they had at the start of their career. \nThat song is called \"The Beginning.\" And Saturday, fans experienced another beginning--of a promising new stage in the band's rising career. \nOf the two acts that opened for Little Big Town Saturday, Drake White and the Big Fire is the one to watch. Although that's what some people were saying back in 2013, when White turned heads with his infectious first single \"The Simple Life,\" before he had a falling out with MCA Nashville. He's on a different label now, and the full-length debut isn't out yet, but Saturday White proved his star potential, from his joyful personality; to his ear for deceptively easy but meaningful lyrics; to one of the most boisterous and soulful male voices in country music right now. \nFind out about the week's must-see shows, concert tickets and more in the newsletter \"Piet Levy's Music Picks.\" Subscribe at jsonline.com/newsletters. \nPiet talks about concerts, local music and more on \"TAP'd In\" with Jordan Lee, 8 a.m. Thursdays on WYMS-FM (88.9). \nTHE TAKEAWAYS \n■ Early in the set, Karen Fairchild accepted a bouquet of pink roses from a fan in the front row, then handed them to her five-year-old son Elijah, sitting at the left hand side of the stage behind the curtain. Elijah watched the show for about 50 minutes--occasionally smelling the flowers, and waving to his mom--until 10 p.m., when he was promptly whisked away. Bedtime, I suppose. \n■There may have been more than 2,000 people in the audience, but Fairchild and Kimberly Schlapman still recognized a couple of fans, calling out \"Tina\" and \"Lisa\" by name. \n■During the show, the band also autographed an old picture from a meet-and-greet with a fan, who at the time had a baby with her. That baby, now a boy, was at the show Saturday, and his \"girl crush,\" Mom professed, was Schlapman, who obliged the young fan by posing with him for a picture. \nTHE SETLIST \n2. \"Quit Breaking Up With Me\" \n3. \"Front Porch Thing\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T11:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:25:15.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
