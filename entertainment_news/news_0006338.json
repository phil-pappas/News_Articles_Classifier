That novel, Adrenaline, Benedict's debut thriller, not only paved the way for a book series, but laid the groundwork for a successful writing career.\nIn addition to garnering high praise from critics and readers alike, drawing comparisons to such best-selling writers as Dean Koontz , Tess Gerritsen and Robin Cook , and achieving best-seller status, Adrenaline and its ensuing success recently landed this physician/novelist a coveted book deal with a leading independent thriller publisher.\nA sensational, skillful and highly suspenseful tale, Adrenaline introduces anesthesiologist protagonist Doug Landry . About Adrenaline: When patients start dying unexpectedly in the O.R. at Mercy Hospital, Doug Landry finds himself the focus of the blame. Is he really incompetent or is there something more sinister going on? As Doug struggles to clear his name and untangle the secrets surrounding these mysterious deaths, it becomes exceedingly clear that someone is serious--dead serious--about keeping the devastating truth from ever seeing the light of day. As he launches a pulse-quickening race against time to prevent more deaths, Doug soon finds that the lives of his patients aren't the only lives at stake. Seems that someone will stop at nothing to keep Doug from revealing the truth. Could it be that murder is the ultimate rush?\nA novel that teems with genuine medical authenticity, Adrenaline takes readers on a high-octane thrill ride from the operating room to the recovery room to the boardroom. A chilling tale that will leave readers wondering where the lines between fact and fiction intersect, Adrenaline is resplendent with realism. A taut, tense, and terrifying thriller, Adrenaline captures medicine's drama, pathos, urgency, tragedy and triumph. Thought-provoking and eerily real, Adrenaline is a not-to-be-missed, un-put-down-able read from an extraordinary new voice in the thriller world.\nAdrenaline is available in trade paper (ISBN: 978-1-484897-52-2, $12.95 ) and eBook editions where fine books are sold. Benedict is also the author of a second Doug Landry thriller, The Edge of Death , also published in trade paper and eBook editions. Benedict's third novel, a stand-alone medical thriller, Fatal Complications (Oceanview Publishing) will be released in December.\nPennsylvania native John Benedict graduated cum laude from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and entered post-graduate training at Penn State University College of Medicine , where he completed medical school, internship, anesthesia residency and a cardiac anesthesia fellowship. Benedict currently works as an anesthesiologist in a busy private practice in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania .
