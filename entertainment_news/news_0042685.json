From a UFO sighting to a monster, the video has all that reminds fans of the core theme of the original series. The said teaser also features dialogs from the new series. \"We must ask ourselves, are we truly alone or are we being lied to?\" Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) says. He also asks his partner, \"Are you ready for this, Scully?\" Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) replies, \"I don't know we have a choice.\" \"The X-Files\" revival will encompass a mixture of stand-alone investigative episodes and those that further the original show's seminal mythology. In the opening episode, Mulder and Scully take on a case of a possible alien abductee. Joel McHale joins the cast as Tad O'Malley, a conservative Internet news anchor who becomes an unlikely ally to Mulder. Annet Mahendru stars as Sveta, a possible alien abductee. The returning stars, meanwhile, also include Annabeth Gish (Monica Reyes), Mitch Pileggi (Walter Skinner), William B. Davis (The Smoking Man), Dean Haglund (Langly), Tom Braidwood (Frohike) and Bruce Harwood (Byers). The latter three are collectively known as the Lone Gunmen. The six-episode event series will launch with a two-night premiere on Sunday, January 24 and Monday, January 25 on FOX. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T10:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:14:19.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
