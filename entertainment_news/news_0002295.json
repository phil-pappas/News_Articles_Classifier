The confrontation took place on the edge of Martyrs Square, less than 1 km (1 mile) from the Sursock.\nBeirut has been hit by a series of protests in recent months against Lebanon's politicians, who bickered over the summer months while rubbish lay uncollected across the city.\nThe political deadlock is one fallout of the four-year civil war in neighboring Syria, which has also brought bombings, economic slowdown and more than 1 million refugees to Lebanon.\nEnvironment Minister Mohammad al-Mashnouk, a focus of the protesters' anger, said the Sursock Museum was a home to the country's artistic and cultural treasures.\n\"Lebanese people need this space, in the midst of the sadness and tragedies we are living through,\" he told Reuters.\nUniversity professor Mona Fawaz drew a link between the protests in Beirut and the revival of the Sursock Museum.\n\"They both work in the same direction,\" she said. \"Both say there is still hope and will in Beirut, and people are working to make the city better.\"\n(Writing by Dominic Evans ; Editing by Alison Williams )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:14:51.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
