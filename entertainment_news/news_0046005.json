And despite his generally even-tempered nature, he wouldn’t be able to withstand that kind of crushing terror and loneliness.\n“I wouldn’t handle it at all,” said the actor, who, oddly enough, has played not one but two stranded astronauts in the past year. “I would be dead in less than 24 hours.”\nIt’s easy to forget sometimes that Matt Damon is just a person like the rest of us.\nYes, Damon is one of the industry’s most versatile and bankable leading men, and he’s able to pull off drama, comedy or action with apparently equal levels of comfort. He won an Oscar while he was still in his 20s for cowriting “Good Will Hunting” and has been nominated twice for his acting. He dedicates enormous amounts of time and energy to worthy causes such as fighting extreme poverty and providing access to safe drinking water in developing countries. He has a reputation — one that took something of a hit this month when comments he made about diversity in Hollywood stirred controversy — as one of the most likable and thoughtful actors around.\n“In a funny kind of way, Matt is almost the perfect representative of the American,” Scott said last month. “He’s fair, he’s sweet, he’s firm, he’s intelligent, and he’s a very can-do kind of guy.”\nOn a late August afternoon, the actor sat on a couch in a Los Angeles hotel room with a cup of coffee, his hair flecked with gray, his muscles sore. In a matter of days, he’d be heading to the Canary Islands to begin work on the as-yet-untitled fifth installment in the “Bourne” action series. At age 44, he said, the regimen of diet and exercise required to play an unstoppable killing machine like Jason Bourne was far more grueling than it used to be.\n“It’s horrible,” Damon said wearily. “I’m in way better shape than I was for any of the other movies, but it’s been 10 times harder. I’m really not fun to be around. I have a horrible attitude.”\nJust as he is not immune to the aging process, Damon is capable of making missteps — as he demonstrated in mid-September when remarks he made on the HBO reality series “Project Greenlight” about diversity in the film industry blew up in his face.\nThe series, coproduced by Damon and longtime friend Ben Affleck, focuses on giving up-and-coming directors the chance to make a feature film. In a heated conversation with producer Effie Brown (“Dear White People”), Damon seemed to suggest that diversity behind the camera was less important than diversity in front of it.\nDamon’s comments, which many deemed off base and patronizing, immediately sparked criticism, with the hashtag #Damonsplaining taking off on Twitter. The actor soon issued an apology.\nRolling with the punches\nIn the more than two decades he has been acting professionally, Damon, who grew up in Cambridge, Mass., and attended Harvard University (he left before graduating to pursue his career), has seen the industry around him change dramatically.\nWhen he looks back at the movies that launched him to stardom — serious, adult-oriented films like “Courage Under Fire,” “The Talented Mr. Ripley,” “The Rainmaker” and “Saving Private Ryan” — he wonders how many of them would even be made today, as studios shift away from midrange dramas toward branded, big-budget tentpole fare.\n“The big whack has been in the kind of $25- to $60-million movie,” he said. “And that was my bread and butter.”\nIn 2013, the actor relocated with his wife, Luciana Barroso, and their four children from New York to Los Angeles. He planned to take six months off from acting to help the kids with the transition. But with the exception of a small role in Christopher Nolan’s “Interstellar,” he ended up staying away far longer than he intended. “There just wasn’t anything interesting, big or small,” he said.\nWhen the prospect of starring in “The Martian” arose, Damon had mixed feelings. On the one hand, undertaking an adaptation of Andy Weir’s best-selling novel — which blends hard science, humor and a suspenseful survival story — sounded exciting, particularly with Scott, who had made the sci-fi classics “Alien” and “Blade Runner,” at the helm. On the other hand, the idea of immediately following “Interstellar” — in which he played an astronaut stuck alone on an ice planet — with another role as a stranded astronaut gave Damon pause.\n“I said to Ridley, ‘I just did a movie where I play a guy who’s stuck by himself on a planet — I don’t think I should just follow it up with a guy who’s stuck by himself on a planet,’ ” Damon said. “Ridley was like: ‘Nobody remembers anything!’ It’s going to be fine!’ ”\nDamon’s upcoming slate is a testament to his varied tastes and his interest in working with top-flight filmmakers. Along with the next “Bourne” film, which reunites the actor with director Paul Greengrass, Damon is set to costar in “The Great Wall,” a big-budget monster epic set in China in AD 1100 directed by Zhang Yimou, and Alexander Payne’s satirical comedy “Downsizing,” in which he plays a man who undergoes a procedure that shrinks him to 4 inches tall.\nAs for “The Martian,” early reviews have been almost universally raves, with critics hailing the film as a refreshingly original blend of spectacle and smarts.\n“Movies like this are harder and harder to find,” Damon said. “It’s not a franchise, and it’s not trying to be a franchise.”\nHe laughed. “Though they would try if the movie did well enough. In the sequel, I’d end up stuck on Saturn.”\n‘The Martian’\nOpens Friday; screenings Thursday in some theaters\nRated PG-13; language, injury images, brief nudity\n2 hours, 21 minutes", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T23:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T07:31:03.379+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
