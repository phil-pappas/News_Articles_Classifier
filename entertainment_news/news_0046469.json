She hopes it's a journey that eventually leads her back to the Bay Area. \n\"If this show is a hit, I'm going to be living up there,\" she says, referring to the new CBS sitcom \"Life in Pieces.\" \"That's where I want to retire. It's my dream.\" \nFor now, retirement is a long way off for the 36-year-old Cabral, who was raised in Carmel Valley and grew up a \"musical theater nerd.\" She's having a blast playing a recent divorcee named Colleen in \"Life in Pieces,\" an extended family sitcom that recently debuted to solid ratings. Carmel Valley native Angelique Cabral is part of the stellar cast on the new CBS comedy \"Life in Pieces.\" (CBS) \n\"I love Colleen because she's relatable,\" Cabral says of the character. \"She's kind of a hot mess and is very funny. She was written the way I talk, so it was an easy fit.\" \nCabral caught the acting bug while in the third grade at All Saints Day School. That's when a teacher heard her singing voice and urged her to audition for the Western Stage's production of \"Oliver.\" She made the cast, paving the way for a youth spent on stages in Salinas, Monterey and Carmel. \n\"I did four or five shows a year. It was a whirlwind,\" she recalls. Advertisement \nCabral went on to study musical theater on a full-ride scholarship at Indiana University, and spent a year in London at the prestigious British American Dramatic Academy. She then headed to New York, eager to make it on Broadway. After eight years of \"pounding the pavement and doing odd jobs,\" including nanny work and catering, she moved to LA in 2009, seeking a change of scenery and fortune. \nFinally, she won a role in the pilot episode of \"Devious Maids,\" a soapy series from producer Marc Cherry (\"Desperate Housewives\"). That opened the door to several TV guest stints and a regular role on the short-lived Fox sitcom \"Enlisted.\" \n\"If you're an actor, it just seems that you're either on a show like this, or you're broke,\" Cabral says. \"There are few in-betweens.\" RIDDLE OF THE ROCK: On the night of June 11, 1962, Alcatraz inmates John Anglin, Clarence Anglin and Frank Morris escaped from the supposedly escape-proof prison. The usual theory is that all three drowned. Now comes a new two-hour TV special that believes otherwise. \"Alcatraz: Search for the Truth\" (9 p.m. Oct. 12, History Channel) promises to present \"new evidence and unprecedented cooperation from family members of the escapees\" that will not only prove that the men survived, but might even still be alive.
