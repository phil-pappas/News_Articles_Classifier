Often, the painter worked while Parker's music played in the background. Just as Parker improvised to create new sounds on the spot, so did Basquiat improvise to create new forms on the canvas.\"\n\"Sacrifice #2: it has to last (after Yoshitoshi's 'Drowsy: the appearance of a harlot of the Meiji era')\" Iona Rozeal Brown, 2007, enamel, acrylic and paper on wooden panel. Courtesy of Rubell Family Collection, Miami (Photo: Detroit Institute of Arts)\n\"Sacrifice #2: It has to last (after Yoshitoshi's \"Drowsy: the appearance of a harlot of the Meiji era),\" by Iona Rozeal Brown \"I appreciate how Brown and other contemporary African-American artists explore diverse cultures throughout the world for source material that they merge together with African-American culture. Brown grew up in Washington attending Japanese Kabuki and Noh theater performances with her mother. Years later, after her further exposure to Japanese culture and the ganguro (blackface) trend popular in Japan in the early '90s, she defied the usual expectations for African-American art by merging the imagery of Geisha women seen in 19th Century Ukiyo-e prints with contemporary African-American hip-hop subject matter. The woman in this painting appears like a hip-hop vixen.\"\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nDIA's provocative '30 Americans' explores new black art\n\"Untitled #25,\" by Leonardo Drew \"I'm a fan of abstract art, and Leonardo Drew creates some of the best work of that genre. This sculpture consisting of numerous cotton bales can be discussed in terms of his enduring adherence to the minimalist grid. However, the expressive content inherent in this sculpture can't be denied due to the labor-intensive quality of the piece, which involved the artist actually making each bale from the cotton batting of mattresses. The cotton bales also evoke America's cotton industry that was built on slave labor.\"\n\"Untitled #25,” Leonardo Drew, 1992, cotton and wax.

Simmons reminds us of this history by selecting the most effective objects to convey the threat and drama of (lynching). Because the title references the children's game Duck, Duck,Goose, and he uses child-size stools, we're reminded of photographic images documenting lynching events of the past with children eating ice cream cones near a limp body dangling from a noose. That sparse and effective installation guarantees that we won't forget the past.\"\n\"Sleep,\" by Kehinde Wiley \"This painting is impressive in scale (132 inches by 300 inches), technique and groundbreaking representation of an African-American man. It demonstrates Wiley's boldness in appropriating a European painting source to assert the beauty of the black body and its long absence from Western art history. The figure also brilliantly displays the artist's knowledge of human anatomy, expert drawing skills and adroit balancing of light and shade. For me, the painting is especially poignant to view at a time when the Black Lives Matter movement is speaking up about the ongoing abuse of black male bodies in American society.\"\n\"Sleep,\" by Kehinde Wiley, 2008, oil on canvas.
