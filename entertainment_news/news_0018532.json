Photo: Jasin Boland \n1. THE MASTER (144 minutes) MA \nPaul Thomas Anderson's 2012 riff on the early days of Scientology focuses on the strange bond between a blustering prophet (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and a dangerously unstable World War II veteran (Joaquin Phoenix). Anderson is an intensely dramatic filmmaker: every scene portrays some kind of power struggle, every aspect of his style is designed to keep us on edge. Rare 70mm print. Astor, today, 6pm. Double bill with Inherent Vice.\n2. MAD MAX: FURY ROAD (120 minutes) MA \nBrooklyn lawyer James Donovan (Tom Hanks) and his wife Mary (Amy Ryan) become the target of anti-communist fears in Bridge of Spies . \nGeorge Miller's long-awaited follow-up to his post-apocalyptic Mad Max trilogy is streamlined and packed with detail, proudly silly and deadly earnest, ultra-commercial and a cry from the heart. Tom Hardy replaces Mel Gibson in the title role, but the real star is Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa, a road warrior in her own right. Selected Hoyts cinemas (check listings for details).  \nAdvertisement 3. BEETLEJUICE (92 minutes) M \nTim Burton let his morbid imagination run wild in this 1988 fantasy-comedy, with Michael Keaton as a manic \"bio-exorcist\" and Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin as a squeaky-clean couple struggling to adjust to life after death. Winona Ryder has one of her best early roles as a teenage goth, and the low-tech special effects are a constant pleasure. Presented by the Cinemaniacs Film Society. Digitally projected. Backlot Studio, today, 8.30pm. Booking recommended (cinemaniacs.net).\nMichael Keaton and Winona Ryder in Beetlejuice . \n4. WHIP IT (111 minutes) M \nThe Texas roller-derby scene is the improbable setting for Drew Barrymore's 2009 directorial debut, one of the best teen movies of recent years. Working with a largely female ensemble cast, Barrymore combines 1990s-style \"girl power\" feminism with moments of uncommon sensitivity, especially in the scenes between the rebellious heroine (Ellen Page) and her disapproving mother (Marcia Gay Harden). Screens as part of the Girls on Film festival. Closed-caption session, digitally projected. Cretan House (150 Nicholson Street, Brunswick East), today, 4pm.\n5. BRIDGE OF SPIES (141 minutes) M \nSteven Spielberg returns to his 20th-century comfort zone with this fact-based Cold War drama, co-scripted by the Coen brothers and starring professional everyman Tom Hanks as a lawyer assigned to defend a Soviet spy (Mark Rylance). It's another Spielberg fairy-tale about a slickster with a heart of gold, but the dexterity of the storytelling is pretty remarkable.
