Solomon has confirmed that he helped recruit Emanuel's first schools CEO, Jean-Claude Brizard, at the request of the mayor-elect's transition team in February 2011. Solomon went on to recommend Byrd-Bennett, who was the firm's lead trainer when CPS hired her as chief education officer; Emanuel appointed her to succeed Brizard.\nThe indictment also could have political repercussions in the Democratic U.S. Senate primary in Illinois.\nSenate candidate Andrea Zopp was a member of the Chicago Board of Education when it twice voted to approve no-bid contracts for SUPES Academy.\nAt a Board of Education meeting on Oct. 24, 2012, Zopp and others on the board voted unanimously to approve the hiring of Byrd-Bennett as schools CEO, then minutes later also voted unanimously to award the first stage of the consulting contract with SUPES, one worth $2.095 million. The vote on SUPES took place with no discussion or debate from board members.\nNine months later, on June 26, 2013, Zopp again voted with other board members to approve the second stage of the contract worth $20.5 million.\nThe tally was 6-0, with one of the seven board members absent. Again, it took place with no discussion or debate on the contract from board members.\nOn Thursday, Zopp’s campaign declined a Chicago Tribune request to interview the candidate on Byrd-Bennett. Appearing before the Tribune Editorial Board in August, Zopp said school district staff conducted a review process on the Supes contract, though she acknowledged that the review staff also worked for Byrd-Bennett.\nAsked if contracting with Byrd-Bennett's former firm raised any concerns, Zopp said, \"No. I mean, actually it didn't.\"\n\"That was a plus, not a negative because she had experience with them,\" Zopp said of Byrd-Bennett and SUPES. \"So being an employee in and of itself would not raise a bell. To me it was (Byrd-Bennett saying), 'I work there, I know what they do is good. I did it.' Me, at the time, I had a lot of respect for her and what she had done so that was a plus.\"\nZopp said that at the time, there was no reason to question the contracts.\nBut following yesterday’s events, Zopp said in a campaign statement that Byrd-Bennett let down children, families, Mayor Emanuel, the Board of Education and herself because they trusted her record and reputation.\n“As a former board member, this is shocking to me on a personal and professional level because I believed that we shared the same agenda – creating a school system that provided every child with the education needed to succeed,” Zopp’s statement said.\nZopp is seeking the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate seat now held by re-election seeking Republican Mark Kirk. U.S. Rep. Tammy Duckworth, a two-term Democrat from Schaumburg, also is seeking the Democratic nomination in the March 15 primary election.\nSo far, the Duckworth camp is quiet on the issue. (Rick Pearson)\nWhat's on tap\n* Mayor Emanuel will talk about the city building bicycle lanes along the Hipster Highway on Milwaukee Avenue. He's also got a morning speech to a jobs group in the Loop.\n* Gov. Bruce Rauner will make two morning appearances in Chicago. The first is the annual conference of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender graduate business school students; the second is the yearly gathering of Hispanic state employees. The governor is not scheduled to take reporters’ questions.\n* Former Gov. George Ryan is scheduled to deliver a keynote address for the Coalition to Reduce Recidivism in Waukegan. It's a rare public appearance for the Republican, who has kept a low profile since being released from federal prison in 2013 after serving years in prison following a corruption conviction.\n* It’s the last day of City Council hearings on Mayor Emanuel’s 2016 budget proposal. (See below for more.)\nFrom the notebook\n*Budget hearings, Day 10: City Council budget hearings wrap up Friday, with the Water Department coming in to talk about the huge ongoing sewer and water pipe project that Mayor Rahm Emanuel used to justify significant hikes on water rates on residents shortly after he took office.\nEmanuel is fond of reminding reporters about how old the city's water infrastructure is whenever there's flooding or a burst water main. The mayor enacted a plan as part of his 2012 budget that doubled average water bills for Chicago residents by this year. He has used the money to speed up the replacement of old pipes and offered lower rates for homes hooked up to water meters to give people an incentive to get their homes hooked up to meters. After this year, water rate increases will be tied to the consumer price index.\nExpect Water Commissioner Tom Powers to face questions from aldermen about particularly flood-prone intersections and viaducts.\nAlso on tap is the Law Department. Aldermen are certain to ask how much the city has paid out to settle cases in which people sued the Police Department alleging officers wrongfully shot them or family members or engaged in other misconduct.\nThe Procurement Department and Department of Administrative Hearings also are set to appear on the final day of hearings for individual parts of the city government. The City Council is scheduled to hold a public hearing on the full budget Wednesday and to vote on Emanuel's plan Oct. 28. (John Byrne)\n*Divvy up?: Bicycle issues were at the fore Thursday as aldermen questioned Chicago Department of Transportation officials about their 2016 budget.\nFar South Side aldermen took the sit-down with Commissioner Rebekah Scheinfeld as an opportunity to press for extension of the Divvy bike rental system to their neighborhoods.\n\"I'm always waiting to get on that little blue Divvy bike that I just don't see on the South Side,\" said Ald. Anthony Beale, 9th.\nAnd Southwest Side Ald. Matt O'Shea, 19th, said he hears from constituents that they're \"anxious for Divvy bikes to make it to my community.\"\nCurrently the rental stations are scattered only as far south as 75th Street, and Scheinfeld made no promises that further additions will be forthcoming soon. \"We have tried to identify additional funds to continue the expansion,\" she said. (John Byrne)\n*Emanuel in D.C.: While in Washington on Thursday, Mayor Emanuel appeared at a Washington Post forum titled “Bridging the Digital Divide 2015.” The mayor spoke about his effort to require computer coding classes in Chicago schools and his push to increase tech jobs in the city, but moderator and Post reporter Robert Costa also couldn’t resist mixing in a few political questions.\nAfter Emanuel jokingly complained, “I was brought here under false premises” and “I feel hijacked now,” he mostly dodged on questions about the presidential campaigns of Hillary Rodham Clinton and Donald Trump. But Emanuel did weigh in on the escalating drama in the U.S. House as Republican infighting has led the impending resignation of Republican Speaker John Boehner.\nEmanuel compared the current internal upheaval, five years after Republicans took control of the chamber in 2010, to the ouster of former Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich in 1998, four years after the GOP won control of the House.\n“In both instances, the party has turned on itself … and to avoid a headline, I’m going to shut my mouth,” Emanuel said, before stopping twice more mid-sentence, clearly resisting the urge to take a shot at Republicans. Then, finally, he just couldn’t help himself: “They have some issues as a party they need to work through that maybe Blue Cross Blue Shield can help them with.”\n*The Sunday Spin: Tribune political reporter Rick Pearson hosts The Sunday Spin from 7 to 9 a.m. Sunday on WGN Radio (720-AM).
