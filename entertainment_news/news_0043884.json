All they have, literally, is the Kardashians,\" Schumer declared during her opening monologue. \"And is that a great message for little girls? A whole family of women that take the faces they were born with as a light suggestion?\"\n\"We used to have Khloe,\" the comedian continued. \"Khloe was ours, right? Whenever there's a group of women, you identify with one of them. Khloe, she lost half her body weight -- she lost a Kendall. We have nothing, and I want good role models!\"\nKardashian has lost 35 pounds thus far, and often shares photos from the gym on social media. She revealed her slimmed-down frame on the August/September cover of Complex, and later said on her website she shed the pounds on her own terms for her self-esteem.\n\"No need 2 tear down others just 2 make urself feel bigger,\" the reality star tweeted on Sunday after Schumer's episode. \"It actually makes u quite small. I'm on a healthy journey. I don't care 4the hate. Let's uplift one another!!! Happy Sunday! Stay smiling!!!'\nSchumer last appeared in Trainwreck with Bill Hader , and will return for a fourth season of her Comedy Central series, Inside Amy Schumer , in spring 2016. Kardashian and her family continue to star on the E! series Keeping Up with the Kardashians , which completed an 11th season Sunday.\n Kardashian-Jenner clan cover Cosmopolitan magazine No charges for Khloe Kardashian over private fireworks show 'Saturday Night Live' guest host Amy Schumer appears in viral video 'Guns' Amy Schumer to receive Hollywood Comedy Award", "external_links": ["https://facebook.com/unitedpress", "https://twitter.com/khloekardashian/status/653293171498024960", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/zhu7rs3Ihas", "https://www.facebook.com/UnitedPress"], "published": "2015-10-13T19:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:36:25.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
