More >> \nBy Sadie Gennis, \nSix weeks after asking \"Miley, what's good?\" on the Video Music Awards stage, Nicki Minaj expounded on the deep-seated hypocrisy she sees in Miley Cyrus telling The New York Times that she can't respect Minaj pointing out how black women are rarely rewarded in pop culture because the rapper was \"not very polite\" about it. \n\"The fact that you feel upset about me speaking on something that affects black women makes me feel like you have some big balls,\" Minaj told New York Times Magazine , addressing Cyrus directly. \"You're in videos with black men, and you're bringing out black women on your stages, but you don't want to know how black women feel about something that's so important? Come on, you can't want the good without the bad. If you want to enjoy our culture and our lifestyle, bond with us, dance with us, have fun with us, twerk with us, rap with us, then you should also want to know what affects us, what is bothering us, what we feel is unfair to us. You shouldn't not want to know that.\" \nNicki Minaj calls out Miley Cyrus at the VMAs \nMinaj continuing to comment on Cyrus isn't a sign that she's milking the feud for publicity or is bitter at being called \"not too kind.\" Instead, it's a reminder that Minaj will never hesitate to call out bias or BS, no matter who it's coming from. That's why when Minaj was asked about another recent feud in her life - between her boyfriend, Meek Mill , and her friend/frequent collaborator, Drake - Minaj didn't allow herself to be forced into any pre-written media narrative. \nMinaj initially responded to questions about Meek and Drake's feud by saying, \"It's between them,\" and telling the reporter, \"You don't ever want to choose sides between people you love. It's ridiculous. I just want it to be over.\" \nHowever, when the reporter pressed if there is \"a part of you that thrives on drama,\" Minaj didn't hesitate to cut to the misogyny at the heart of the question. ''What do the four men you just named have to do with me thriving off drama?'' she asked. ''Why would you even say that? That's so peculiar. Four grown-ass men are having issues between themselves, and you're asking me do I thrive off drama?'' \nNicki Minaj producing sitcom about her life \n''That's the typical thing that women do. What did you putting me down right there do for you?'' Minaj asked. ''Women blame women for things that have nothing to do with them. ... To put down a woman for something that men do, as if they're children and I'm responsible, has nothing to do with you asking stupid questions, because you know that's not just a stupid question. That's a premeditated thing you just did.'' \n\"Do not speak to me like I'm stupid or beneath you in any way'' Minaj declared, before ending the interview on her terms like the boss she is.
