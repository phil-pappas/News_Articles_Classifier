Just because it's full of ravaged specters, gory murders, a quietly intense lunatic and a big old haunted house? \nBut del Toro has a razor-sharp point: Instead of looking back to gruesome monster movies, the extravagantly moody \"Crimson Peak\" draws its true inspiration from Gothic romances – classic female-centric stories with resolute heroines, Byronic heroes and at least one candle-lit investigation of noises in the night. \nHere are six shockers to get you in the mood, or keep the frights going. \n\"Jane Eyre.\" A shadowy mansion, a nervous governess, a brooding nobleman, a locked room – Charlotte Bronte's novel is the deep dark spring from which all Gothic romances flow. (You think \"Dark Shadows\" was original?) It's been endlessly adapted, with each era contributing its own ill-humored star as Rochester – Colin Clive, William Hurt, even George C. Scott. For classic chills, go for the 1943 version with Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine; more modern moods, the 2011 one with Michael Fassbender and Mia Wasikowska. \n\"Rebecca.\" \"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again.\" Another oft-adapted melodrama, this one by Daphne du Maurier. Like \"Jane Eyre,\" the ghosts here are more metaphoric – particularly the domineering spirit of the title character, who hangs over everyone like a storm cloud. But the sense of anguish is real, and the 1940 version, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, is brilliant at exploiting the insecurities of the frightened young bride (Fontaine, again). Watch this one for the malevolent Mrs. Danvers, played to pursed perfection by Judith Anderson. \n\"Dragonwyck.\" You don't have to go to Europe to find crumbling mansions; sometimes upstate New York will do just fine. This Anya Seton best-seller became a fine 1946 chiller from director Joseph L. Mankiewicz, starring Gene Tierney as the governess first hired, then romanced by a distant cousin; that he's Vincent Price should be her first warning, but too late -- cut to the sputtering candlelight and spooky late-night piano playing. A richly atmospheric melodrama with a great supporting cast and Price warming up for his horror career to come. \n\"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" Every list of Gothic Romances needs a touch of Poe, a writer whose scariest monsters were always of the mind. And Roger Corman's 1961 adaptation (with a smart script from Richard Matheson) is one of the best, this time told from the (anti-)hero's point of view, with poor Vincent Price (now in the full force of his horror-film stardom) as the Spanish noble slowly going mad. Or is someone helping drive him? Nicely done, with terrific sets, a smart ending and the great Barbara Steele adding her own witchy charms. \n\"The Horrible Dr. Hichcock.\" \"His lust was a desire that burned brightest in the shadow of the grave!\" With a tagline like that, audiences knew what they were getting from this 1963 Ricardo Freda chiller, but poor young bride Barbara Steele still had some rude awakenings ahead. Creepy, classic Euro-horror with one of its premiere stars as our imperiled heroine, Robert Flemyng as the sicko surgeon, and a misspelling designed to avoid legal charges but still trick fans into thinking they were buying something else. Hard to find but hugely recommended. \n\"Uncle Silas.\" Another slightly obscure chiller, based on the great Victorian melodrama by the Irish writer J. Sheridan Le Fanu; in this tale, an orphaned teen is sent to stay with a black-sheep relative, now said to have reformed. Or has he? An opium habit would seem to indicate otherwise, as would his keen interest in his young ward's estate. A candlelit creeper that, like Le Fanu's \"Carmilla,\" has a few kinky undertones and makes great bedtime reading for the bookish; film fans can search out \"The Dark Angel,\" a 1987 BBC adaptation with Peter O'Toole . \nStephen Whitty may be reached at stephenjwhitty@gmail.com .
