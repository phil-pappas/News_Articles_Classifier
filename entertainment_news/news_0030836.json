With the latest funding decisions, viewers are being given even greater choice of local content, and more options for how to enjoy it. \nNZ On Air’s webseries fund attracted a record 109 applications. \n\"The calibre was outstanding; we were blown away. We had to make some very hard choices, but we were so impressed that we found some extra money to support more than we had originally intended,\" said NZ On Air Chief Executive Jane Wrightson. \nIn total eight webseries, most with strong comedic themes, have been supported. \nThe week’s events in every field from politics to sport will be satirised in a weekly current affairs comedy The Civilian. While viewers will find laughs aplenty at The Water Cooler, where bored office workers gather to regale each other with truly outrageous supposedly true stories. \nChildren’s sci-fi drama Reset imagines aliens have landed in Auckland, responding to a distress signal from our dying planet. A young MÄori boy prophet is one of the few who can decode the dying Earth’s message. \nTwo webseries for teen audiences are: Lucy Lewis Can’t Lose, a comedy about standing up for what you believe in; and Bright Summer Night, inspired by A Midsummer Nights’ Dream, follows a group of teens who ‘lose themselves’ at a house party. \nFriday Night Bites is a weekly comedy series from the makers of the successful webseries Flat3. Each week the female flatties will get up to hijinks inspired by true anedcotes from fans. A third season of the acclaimed webseries High Road has also been supported, in which Terry Huffer’s life spirals out of control. \nA Band Called Hook Ups sees the return of musical twins Kowhai and Monty, stars of one of NZ On Air’s first funded webseries Hook Ups, as they continue their struggle to crack the music industry. \nSupported for both television broadcast and online were three feature films: Hunt For The Wilderpeople directed by Taika Waititi is an adventure story loosely based on the Barry Crump book Wild Pork And Watercress; Tip Top Taj Mahal is a screen adaptation of the acclaimed play Krishnan’s Dairy, and Chief Gary, is a comedy about a struggling real estate agent who inherits a tiny sinking island in the Pacific. \nRising comedians will feature in a one-hour stand-up special hosted by Urzila Carlson for TV3, Aotearoha Rising Stars, while Friday night laughs are set to continue in 2016 with returning series of Jono And Ben and 7 Days. \nFunding details \nA Band Called Hook Ups, Fumes Productions for online,$100,000 \nBright Summer Night, The Candle Wasters for The Wireless, $100,000 \nFriday Night Bites, Flat3 Productions for online $100,000 \nLucy Lewis Can’t Lose, Redletter for 3Now On Demand $64,720 \nHigh Road Season 3, Tomorrowland for online, $100,000 \nReset, Girl Viking for MÄori Television On Demand, $100,000 \nThe Civilian, NZME Vision for NZME, $100,000 \nThe Water Cooler, Breakdown Productions for NZME, $100,000 \nTelevision Contestable fund \nHunt For The Wilderpeople, 1 x 120mins, Majestical Productions for TV2, $199,999 \nTip Top Taj Mahal, 1 x 120mins, South Pacific Pictures for Choice TV, up to $199,999 \nChief Gary, 1 x 120mins, Filmwork for NZME, $199,999 \nJono And Ben, 26 x 1hr, Mediaworks TV for TV3, $1,717,042 \n7 Days, 32 x ½ hr, MediaWorks TV for TV3, $1,056,000 \nAotearoha Rising Stars, 1 x 1hr MediaWorks TV for TV3, $75,218 \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T23:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:38:54.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
