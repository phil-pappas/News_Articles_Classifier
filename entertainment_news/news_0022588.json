Comment   Ed Stafford Posted Oct. 19, 2015 at 3:00 PM By Ed Stafford Posted Oct. 19, 2015 at 3:00 PM Smoke rises from eight campfires beside heavy, high-wheeled chuck wagons parked in a broad semi-circle. Men in wide-brimmed hats that shade their faces, colorful scarves, long-sleeved shirts, and high boots stir iron pots of beans with long handled spoons. Women in poke bonnets, floor-length cotton dresses and aprons engage in conversation as they peel potatoes and chop onions and chilies for waiting pots and skillets. At the back of each wagon, a fold-down table serves the kneading of dough and preparation of recipes. Spices and coffee, utensils and canned goods are taken from their compartments and shelves in the cupboard that rides back there. Groups idle on hay bales spread out for suppertime seating. The scene, straight out of any camp in the early West, is typical of daytime at Delbert Jones' bunk house, 28100 County Road 809 (Gun Club Road) in La Junta Gardens north of La Junta, on the day of a \"Doc\" Jones Chuckwagon Cookoff, taking place this year on Saturday, Oct. 24. As in late October of past years, the sky is a brilliant blue and the air is crisp with autumn. Trees that border the yard and shade chuck wagons cast welcome cooling shadows over a day that retains memory of summer. There is heat and dust and wind; there is always a little wind. After all, this is southeastern Colorado. Dogs and children play chase around the yard. From the corrals out back comes the bellow of a steer. Horses whinny and snort. There is the rumble and treble of voices and bursts of laughter as stories and gossip are shared. Women call to neighboring wagons and voices answer. As chores are continued, cooks from wagons mingle and then separate to begin the next chore. Fires are fanned and flame up under spiders and dutch ovens. It is a scene that evokes the rural life of then and now. \"Doc\" Jones, in his characteristic black cowboy hat, colorful scarf at the throat, leather cuffs, and high boots wanders about the grounds all day, overseeing operations, joking, making things easy for the cooks, to whom he distributed ingredients in the early day. This is a major undertaking he began organizing back in the summer and which he has worked with increasing energy into the fall. It's all coming together now. Crews of five each are preparing to feed an expected 550 from eight chuck wagons. Their day began at 6 a.m. The crowd will start lining up at 4:30 for \"Doc\" Jones' Chuckwagon supper, and cooks will work into the evening â€” serving and still cooking. It is nearing 4:30 now, time for the serving to begin. Neighbors and friends have been filling the bunk house yard, talking, calling out, laughing. They have been gathering for an hour and more. Singly and in groups, folks move about, stopping to watch the cooks getting ready to serve diners on long makeshift tables. There is the rich fragrance of meat and potatoes and onions frying, bread baking, coffee and beans cooking. Smoke from the daylong cook fires beckons. A cowboy band is warming up on the bunk house porch, guitars, a bass, banjos. Page 2 of 2 - As they wait in the bunk house yard, and wait at the gate with their tickets, many who have come to \"Doc's\" look as though they just got off work, in town or on the farm. Western clothes, comfortable clothes predominate. There is movement toward the chuck wagon at the gate as they fall into line holding out their $20 tickets. At 4:30, they surge forward, exchanging tickets for plastic utensils, rolled in napkins, and paper plates, then form lines at each of the eight chuck wagon tables, where cooks are ready and already ladling cowboy beans and country potatoes onto plates. Steak and freshly baked rolls are placed on plates. There is still room for the peach cobbler dessert. While they eat what they were served at the first wagon they visited, lines form again at another wagon and another to be served by their version of the same menu. Or they take a break, sit on a hay bale with their plates and cups of coffee or bottled water and enjoy the cowboy band that is playing in full chorus now, and watch the sun beginning to set behind the surrounding trees. Although all the food is good, one or two chuck wagons may appeal to the palate most, and everyone is invited to vote for that wagon which has satisfied them best. It is important to note, as they realize, that they must not fill up at the first wagon or the second. They want to sample the cooking from all eight without being overfed. Gradually all the food is served, the lines diminish, and as twilight comes, there is a peace that settles over the scene as the musicians continue to play. Cars and trucks are claimed, and as they disappear down Gun Club Road, there are still knots of satisfied neighbors and friends who remain in the yard, talking quietly together. This is the \"Doc\" Jones Chuckwagon Cookoff that has been advertised and anticipated. The atmosphere is nostalgic, the smells compelling, the fun is evident. Everyone is invited. Reservations for tickets costing $20 can be had by contacting CrossRoads MarketPlace in La Junta (384-7551), the La Junta Chamber of Commerce (384-7411), or tammy@pharocattle.com.
