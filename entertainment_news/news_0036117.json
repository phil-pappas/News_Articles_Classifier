Related Content Critics: 'Jem' is anything but excitement By Henry Hanks CNN \nThe star of the fan favorite \"Evil Dead\" trilogy is reprising his role of Ash after a 23-year absence, and it's one of six shows -- some scary and some sweet -- to watch this Halloween week. \n\"Ash versus Evil Dead,\" Saturday 9 p.m. ET, Starz \nAsh has a new generation of characters to assist in fighting off the living dead, who have returned in the present day. \nAsh may be older but he can still wield a chainsaw. \nLike the classic horror movie trilogy (never mind the 2013 movie reboot) which started in 1981, the new series promises heaping helpings of extreme violence and gore. \nCampbell is joined in the new series by Lucy Lawless, and \"Evil Dead\" director Sam Raimi is producing the series. \n\"The Simpsons,\" Sunday 8 p.m., Fox \nCan you believe it's been 25 years since the annual \"Simpsons\" Halloween episodes began? \n\"Treehouse of Horror XXVI\" sees the return of Sideshow Bob, and we're told he will finally have his revenge on Bart Simpson this time (no worries, though, as these episodes have nothing to do with the show's continuity). \n\"It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown,\" Thursday 8 p.m., ABC \nThe beloved Halloween classic aired last week, but you have a second chance to catch it Thursday night. \n\"Bones,\" \"Sleepy Hollow,\" Thursday 8 p.m., Fox \nHow exactly does \"Sleepy Hollow's\" Ichabod Crane end up helping Dr. Brennan on \"Bones\"? \nFox hopes you'll tune in Thursday for this Halloween crossover to find out. \n\"Modern Family,\" Wednesday 9 p.m., ABC \nPhil takes over Halloween decorating duties this year, something Halloween fan Claire might end up regretting. \n\"Family Guy,\" Sunday 9 p.m., Fox \nPeter and his friends are in search of a Halloween movie idea and end up accidentally killing someone. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource .
