Dumaplin\nOctober 16, 2015 Richard Yap and Jodi Sta. Maria (Photo from Richard’s Instagram)\nWe last saw Richard Yap and Jodi Sta. Maria together as Ser Chief and Maya, respectively, in the now-defunct, family-oriented TV series “Be Careful With My Heart.”\nThat could change soon.\nOn Tuesday, Richard took to Instagram hinting at a supposed reunion project with his former leading lady.\nSharing a selfie with Jodi, he captioned it: “Ito na ba ang hinihintay niyo………. Abangan.”\nRichard’s road manager, Dan Rafael Dequito, added to the excitement via a separate Instagram post showing a photo of the two stars with the following hashtags: “soon,” “Maya,” “Ser Chief” and “reunited once again.”\nAlthough ABS-CBN and Star Cinema are still mum on the matter, some netizens assumed the two might get back together on the silver screen for this year’s Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF).\nRecall that the entry “All You Need Is Pag-ibig” is being speculated to have been shelved after Kris Aquino pulled out of the project. Still, there’s no official word yet as far as that goes.\nNow, assuming this could be the chance for the erstwhile love team to make a comeback, fans readily grew excited over the possibility. Many commented on the actor’s post.\nOne said, “Oh my gosh! Is the long wait really over? My favorite love team is back?! I’m so excited!”\nAnother added, “Ser Chief (I) can’t help it, unlimited ang saya. Thank you so much. We are all so blessed. Forever ‘KAPIT BISIG.’”\nYet another joined in, posting, “I’m really glad that you and (Jodi) are together again. This will make a lot of your supporters truly happy. If the movie pushes thru this December, then it’s probably the best gift for all the JoChard (Jodi and Richard) fans.”", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:10:47.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
