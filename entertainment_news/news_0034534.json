Anyway, he was Bill Cosby. Who would believe me?\" \nBarrett alleged Cosby had grabbed her from behind and pressed his body against her during a University of Pennsylvania event in 2004. \nCosby's new lawyers declined to comment on the latest accusers. Cosby has denied previous allegations and has never been criminally charged. \nIt appears there are more women ready to come forward with allegations against the embattled comic - Allred told the media at the press conference she has been contacted by more women. \n\"I can assure Mr. Cosby that there are still more victims who will be courageous enough to come forward in the future,\" she said. \nCosby had to testify under oath earlier this month (Oct15) when he was called to give a deposition in a California civil suit brought by a woman who claimed the comedian sexually abused her at the Playboy Mansion when she was 15. \nAllred, who was the woman's lawyer, hopes to pursue a second deposition of Cosby.
