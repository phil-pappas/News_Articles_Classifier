It’s our first morning in town, and we’ve landed at Suzy Wong’s House of Yum. The restaurant’s chef and owner, Arnold Myint, was a “Top Chef” contestant. Suzy Wong is the main character of a 1957 novel and a campy 1960 movie, a Chinese lady of the night who takes up with a U.S. diplomat — and Myint’s drag persona.\nIt’s only midmorning, but women sit around giant fishbowls of booze and let out high-pitched screams at some hazy memory of weekend hijinks.\nMy wife and I have lived and traveled all over the country, keeping an open mind about all regions and peoples, but preconceived notions of the South seeped into our perceptions like a misty pollutant. Tennessee is the birthplace of the Ku Klux Klan. Nashville, Bullard and Copeland remind us, is considered the buckle of the Bible Belt.\nThe city is also the home of country music, where the Grand Ole Opry got its start 90 years ago and visitors drink up the Disney-esque Country Music Hall of Fame or stray no farther than downtown’s touristic music road, Broadway.\nBut as we learned during our trip, Nashville is more than all that. For every slicked-up country star, there’s a singer/songwriter waiting for her turn on stage. Urbanism and new residents are transforming the city, even as it upholds great culinary and roots music traditions. There’s no place quite like it.\nLet’s start with music. In Nashville, it’s everywhere, intimate and diverse.\nOur first music in Nashville? Opera. If you’re there in summer, do what we did: Drive to Vanderbilt Dyer Observatory for “Opera on the Mountain,” featuring some of the finest, lesser known opera singers in a casual, outdoor venue. There’s something great about hearing Artistic Director John Hoomes tell you about the finer points of “Turandot” in his Southern lilt. And the singing? Superb.\nWe sought to avoid country of the “I’m-drunk-and-got-my-girl-and-my-truck” variety. But we would be foolish to come to Nashville and skip out on the singer/songwriters, bluegrass and roots music that are under country’s big tent, music often born of joyous and sometimes angry defiance, and so central to American history.\nWhat’s the difference between a fiddle and a violin? I learned the answer in Nashville: You don’t spill beer on a violin.\nAlthough well-known to locals and music aficionados for years, the Bluebird Cafe now draws massive crowds due in part to “Nashville.” The TV show is a guilty pleasure for my wife, Leila, so we head there for Monday open-mic night, which features more singer/­songwriters than country-star wannabes. Just witnessing the devotion to creativity and craft, watching humans chase their bliss, brings me joy. They are trying to fill a hole in their souls (plenty evidenced by the lyrics), in part by filling the hole in ours.\nAnother strip mall in an industrial area, and another great music venue: 3rd and Lindsley.\nWe sit in the balcony, sip RC Cola and rum and listen to Haas Kowert Tice, a talented young trio. Later the main event takes the stage: The Lonesome Trio — an acoustic band featuring Ed Helms and two pals — hits the stage with mandolin, guitar, banjo and bass.\nHelms sings: “I can’t hardly move/There’s a picture on the wall/It’s just you and me/It looks about to fall.”\nThe actor and comedian may be rich and famous, but Helms has had his heart broken, too.\nGrub. The South’s pre-eminence of the prandial has lately been threatened by the American food revolution: You can now go to almost any U.S. city and get a great meal. But for flavor and simplicity, people staffing the stoves in Nashville know what they’re doing because their great-grandmothers did it and passed it on.\nYou’ll want to spend some time in 12 South. The neighborhood was in a bad way not too long ago, but now is a hotbed of restaurants, bars, coffee shops and boutiques.\nOn our final night, a Monday, we had a perfectly greasy burger, fries and shake at the Pharmacy. Music on the stereo: “Belong” from Washed Out, which Rolling Stone once accurately described as “zonked out electropop.” (What did I tell you about great music everywhere?)\nOn good advice, we hit the dance party at the 5 Spot in East Nashville. The space was hot, dank and dark, and the DJ was spinning oldies and rockabilly, with classic Ed Sullivan performances projected on a screen.\nDancers cut up the floor fiercely to the Drifters’ “Drip Drip Drippity Drop,” swinging each other around with practiced exuberance.\nBy the looks of it, the crowd, the young and the hungry, had come from every boring hamlet in America to find that thing they couldn’t name but sure could feel.\nEvery city on the make has that bar with a good soundtrack and your crowd, the place where you were sure you would change the world and fall in love, maybe on the same night.\nThe 5 Spot, in all its sweaty sexiness, is one of those places.\nAnd Nashville is one of those cities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:43:59.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
