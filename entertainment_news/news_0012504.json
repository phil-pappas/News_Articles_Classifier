My dad would drive me because I wasn’t old enough. I saw some crazy things there, and I have been obsessed with it ever since.” \nThe movie starts in 1987 with bands such as Confront and Outface. The singer of Confront went on to form the controversial One Life Crew, while members of Outface joined bands with mainstream success such as Sepultura, Filter and Civ. \nThe scene darkened a few years later with bands such as Ringworm and Integrity, who had apocalyptic lyrics and a more metallic sound. Many other bands popped up before and after, including H100s, Cider, Apartment 213 and 9 Shocks Terror. \nOne thing that remained constant was the no-holds-barred attitude at shows that often resulted in fireworks, mayhem and destroyed venues. \n“Destroy Cleveland” was finished in July, and Greenfield has been traveling to screenings across the country. \nHe has shown the film in 10 cities so far, including Cleveland, Columbus, Los Angeles, Buffalo and Richmond, Va. “The bands have a cult following, and when people heard about the movie, it garnered an immediate buzz,” said Greenfield. \nMost filming took place at Now That’s Class in Cleveland. Other locations include My Mind’s Eye Records and Hausfrau Records, both in Cleveland the Rock Room in Pittsburgh and Yellow Jacket Social Club in Austin. \nHelping shoot the film were Colby Grimes of Youngstown and Jorge Matthew Delarosa of Kent.
