Photo: Supplied \nThe Waifs' guitarist Josh Cunningham is a practical sort of fellow. Talking about the band's four-year hiatus between albums and subsequent break from touring together, he doesn't mix his words or get caught up in spin. You simply get the impression this is just how things rolled.\n\"It's always been a bit of a wheel that turns around for us,\" he says. \"We've taken a bit of time off at different times in our history as well. So there is no real magic answer to it, that's just the way it kind of worked out.\"\nWith the Waifs recently releasing their seventh studio album, Beautiful You , a drive to create what comes from within, but also from the audiences who appreciate what they do, is central to their motivation.\nIndie rock favourites The Waifs will perform at The Canberra Theatre on November 1. Photo: Supplied \n\"Over the years we've been really quite humbled to hear a lot of people's stories of what our music has meant to them. There's been a lot of love expressed, a lot of people just wishing us to make music again, tour again, because we've had a few years off, and I guess when you realise how meaningful your music can be to other people, it's kind of a pretty humbling and special thing.\"\nAdvertisement With the band members now used to being separated by geography (Donna Simpson lives in Fremantle after eight years in Minneapolis, Vikki Thorn lives in Utah and Cunningham splits time between California and southern New South Wales) working out how to get together when they are going to be recording or touring is something they have grown accustomed to.\n\"It's been that way for a few years now,\" Cunningham says. \"Once everyone got married and moved to settle down in their respective places, it's always been something that we've planned and arranged. Gone are the days where we were in each other's pockets, when working on new music was as simple as pulling out the guitars and having a jam. But it's not that hard to organise though. We've all got places that we can all go to.\"\nFor Beautiful You , Cunningham, Thorn and Simpson found a place on the south-west coast of Western Australia to write songs and do some pre-production for the album. A few of the tracks that made it on there weren't new, but numbers Cunningham had tucked up his sleeve, waiting for the right moment to use.\n\"One of them is called Dark Highway ,\" he says. \"It's written from an actual experience that I had where my car broke down on the side of the road and no one would stop to help me. I didn't have coverage on my phone and I needed to call for roadside assistance and I couldn't do it. So I tried to flag down passing cars and none of them would stop. So it got dark and I just kind of crawled into the back of my van. I had a guitar in there and was reflecting on my plight and the general state of the world and wrote a song about the experience.\"\nCurrently touring the country to promote Beautiful You , the Waifs are joined by the super-talented 2014 Double J Artist of the Year, Mia Dyson.\n\"We've always been huge fans of her music,\" Cunningham says. \"She's an incredibly talented girl. Any time we get to just listen to her play is pretty awesome. So to get to go on tour and have her playing every night, we feel pretty lucky.\"\nThe Waifs \nWith : Mia Dyson\nWhen : 7.30pm, Sunday, November 1\nWhere : Canberra Theatre\nTickets : $56.50 - $61.50 from canberratheatrecentre.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:22:22.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
