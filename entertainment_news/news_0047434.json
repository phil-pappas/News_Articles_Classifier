After all, that's where the big Broadway tours play, and Groban's two-hour show was almost entirely devoted to \"Stages,\" his album of Broadway tunes. Groban grew up loving Broadway, and the only surprise about \"Stages\" was that it took him this long to release a Broadway album. He opened the show with \"Pure Imagination\" from \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\" accompanied by a lone pianist—until a curtain opened in mid-song to reveal an orchestra. Groban is a born balladeer, with a big, beautiful voice that he once described as \"baritone with some high notes up my sleeve.\" He edges towards the operatic when he's really belting it out, say on \"What I Did For Love\" from \"A Chorus Line.\" But he never quite crossed that line. That's a good thing, because when true opera singers try to sing pop, or Broadway, it never sounds quite right. Their voices overpower the material; it's like putting a Ferrari engine into a Fiat. Groban is also a charmer, speaking easily from the stage about everything from the first time he sang a solo in junior high school to how much fun it is to say \"Providence\" in a fake French accent. But it was the singing everyone came for, and Groban delivered the goods on \"Old Devil Moon\" from \"Finian's Rainbow,\" and a melancholy \"Try to Remember\" from \"The Fantasticks.\" He showed off his higher register on audience favorite \"Bring Him Home\" from \"Les Miserables.\" Along with those high notes, Groban had a special guest up his sleeve, Lena Hall, who won a Tony for her performance in the 2014 Broadway revival of \"Hedwig and the Angry Inch.\" Hall did a couple of duets with Groban, \"All I Ask of You\" from \"Phantom of the Opera,\" and \"Move On\" from \"Sunday in the Park with George.\" She also did two songs on her own, Queen's \"Save Me\" and Paul McCartney's \"Maybe I'm Amazed.\" Hall, who also sings with a rock band, brought an edge to the PPAC stage that Groban, for all his sterling qualities, just doesn't have. But Groban has power to spare, as he showed on \"You'll Never Walk Alone,\" which he dedicated to victims of Thursday's shooting in Oregon. For his encore, he sang \"Over the Rainbow.\" To my mind, that song has been done a few too many times by a few too many singers, but Groban did a fine job, finishing on an unexpected soft, sweet note.
