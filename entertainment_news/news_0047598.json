She did not say when prosecutors would decide whether to file charges against Cosby. \nA police spokesman confirmed that investigators presented a case to prosecutors, but he declined to comment further. \nA representative for Cosby declined to comment on Thursday. \nVeteran comedian Cosby, best known for the sitcom \"The Cosby Show\", has been accused by more than 50 women of sexual assault in incidents dating back to the 1960s that fall outside the statute of limitations for criminal or civil cases. \nCosby's lawyers have repeatedly in the past denied any wrongdoing on his part. \nHe is scheduled to give a deposition Oct. 9 in the civil lawsuit brought by a woman, Judy Huth, accusing the comedian of sexually abusing her at the Playboy Mansion in 1974 when she was 15 years old. \nOn Wednesday, three more women said Cosby drugging and sexually assaulting them in incidents.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:30:45.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
