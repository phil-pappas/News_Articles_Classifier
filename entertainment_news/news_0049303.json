Photo: Nic Walker \nA decade ago, John Kaldor says he would have scoffed at the idea of staging the world premiere of a dance piece.\nYet the millionaire philanthropist's latest public art project presents the work of French choreographer and former molecular biologist Xavier le Roy.\nLe Roy's Temporary Title , a new work featuring 18 Australian performers, will be exhibited at Carriageworks in six-hour stretches from November 20 to 22.\n\"I think Lisa Havilah is a wonderful administrator\": philanthropist John Kaldor. Photo: Nic Walker \nHis solo work Self Unfinished will also be staged as part of Kaldor Public Art Project 31.\nAdvertisement Kaldor says the notion of dance exhibited rather than performed is groundbreaking.\n\"He was one of the first, if not the first, to just break that barrier and introduce movement and dance into the gallery setting,\" Kaldor says. \"He calls what he is going to do an exhibition not performance.\"\nFrench choreographer Xavier le Roy will present the world premiere of his new dance work Temporary Title at Carriageworks. \nThis dramatically changes the role of the audience, according to Carriageworks director Lisa Havilah. \"In Temporary Title you enter into the work as you would enter into an exhibition. You can move about within the work freely. You can leave when you want.\n\"As an audience member you can define your own experience and your own level of engagement.\"\nHavilah says standing in a room surrounded by performers will be a physical and intellectual experience – \"both challenging to stay with and impossible to leave.\"\nShe also says le Roy has a distinct approach to choreography: \"Instead of instructing his dancers [collaborators] how to move using a specific technique, direction or tempo, he proposes ideas and then allows these ideas to be actualised independently by each collaborator.\"\nLe Roy, who is working with fellow choreographer and dancer Scarlet Yu, will also open the doors of his rehearsal room to allow members of the public brave or foolhardy enough to put in their own two cents' worth.\n\"He's rehearsing it for a long time with 18 Australian performers, whether dancers or actors,\" Kaldor says. \"They will help to shape the work and I think audience participation in open rehearsals will have the same aim if they want to interact and in some way influence the outcome of the work.\"\nFrom Christo wrapping the coast of Little Bay in 1968-69 to Jeff Koons' giant floral puppy planted at Circular Quay in 1995 and Marina Abramovic: In Residence earlier this year, Kaldor has invited some of the world's leading contemporary artists to show work in Australia.\n\"We work principally with international artists but what we want are artists who are well-known leaders in their field to work with and mentor Australian artists,\" he says.\nBut Kaldor is not tempted to tell le Roy and his dancers how to move during the open rehearsals.\n\"I certainly will come and see it,\" he says. \"Whether I will influence it or not … I'd rather watch it and see what others do.\"\nLast seen in Sydney as part of the 13 Rooms group show in 2013, le Roy's first dance exhibition Retrospective was created in 2012 and shown at the Fundacio Antoni Tapies in Barcelona and later the Centre Pompidou in Paris and New York's Museum of Modern Art, where Kaldor sits on its International Council.\nKaldor describes his latest imported artist as \"a fascinating man\", with a unique approach to movement.\n\"He comes from a very different background,\" he says. \"He got so frustrated with the French medical bureaucracy that he took up chorography and dance as an adult. Normally when a dancer is thinking of quitting, he started.\"\nThe era of passive audiences staring at paintings on walls may also be on the wane as galleries and museums seek news to attract visitors.\n\"The Tate Modern is opening next year their new extension and a lot of it is devoted to performance,\" Kaldor says. \"It's all about how to engage the public.\n\"It's not that long ago that galleries were just repositories of artwork and they did not want too many people in there in case they polluted the air and damaged artwork.\"\nKaldor says Carriageworks in the former Eveleigh Railway Workshops is one of the most interesting cultural venues in Australia: \"Carriageworks has art, has performance, has theatre, has opera, has fashion, has the markets on Saturday and to me this is the formula for how a contemporary art space should be.\n\"And I think Lisa Havilah is a wonderful administrator, who created this formula.\"\nKaldor Public Art Project 31: Xavier Le Roy is at Carriageworks from November 5 to 22.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:40:32.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
