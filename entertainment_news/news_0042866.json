Henson-led series had a 5.0 rating for adults between the ages of 18 to 49 with just under 13 million viewers tuning it. \nThat's a drop of eight percent from the week before when the show nabbed 13.7 million viewers. \nRegardless, Empire continues to lead in the ratings for Wednesday night primetime programming. \nThe series, created by Lee Daniels, airs Wednesday nights at 9 p.m. Eastern on Fox. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:59:07.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
