The project is being set up at Relativity Television with Skip Woods writing the script. Woods will also exec produce with Adrian Askarieh, who first optioned the comic back in 2005, and Ray Ricord. Daniel Alter and Geoffrey Yim are co-executive producers. The producers are looking now for directors who can make the show dark and gritty. Created by Tim Seeley and Stefano Caselli, Hack/Slash centers on 'Cassie Hack, a woman who symbolizes the cliche of the lone girl who survives at the end of every horror movie. However, the emotionally damaged girl not only survived but has become a killer of killers. Along with a burly protector named Vlad, Hack travels across the country hunting slashers in the vein of Halloween's Michael Myers, Friday the 13th's Jason Voorhees and A Nightmare on Elm Street's Freddy Krueger.'", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:36:10.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
