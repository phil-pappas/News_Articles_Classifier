You don’t cross Annalise, Bonnie. Come on now. \nWe’re back in the living room and Asher is talking with Connor about safe sex. Asher doesn’t exactly strike me as the safe sex kind of guy, so it’s an awkward conversation to say the least. Also, Frank knows that Bonnie killed Rebecca and is letting her know in his creepy Frank way. \nHe takes a phone call from Annalise on a flip phone, solidifying the fact that Frank is the only person in 2015 still using a flip phone. \nAt Nate’s hearing, the prosecutor immediately interrogates Annalise, wondering how she and Nate pulled off Sam’s murder. It’s clear from very early on that this prosecutor is going after Annalise as she details the beginnings of her relationship with Nate. \nThey first had sex in a bar bathroom. That Annalise Keating is always classy. I’m not really sure how these details relate to the case but the judge allows it before calling for a recess. \nOutside the courtroom, Connor is hot and bothered about Nate’s sex life while Michaela tells him to just “screw Oliver” if it means he will stop being an ass. In walks new guy Levi, who pulls a Tinder-like pathetic pickup line on Michaela. \nShe has none of it but Connor loves every minute and encourages her to date Levi. These two just became my favorite duo on the show. Connor needs to be her permanent matchmaker because Michaela needs to loosen up. \nBack with the Hapstall case, DNA links Caleb to the aunt’s car the night she was murdered. Annalise sends Wes in to manipulate Catherine into admitting she was covering for Caleb. Of course it works, because Wes’s puppy dog eyes never fail him. \nNate’s hearing is back in session and Sinclair is going at Annalise accusing her of a violent history. This prompts Annalise to scream at her, “Please just charge me with my husband’s murder!” proclaiming this is a witch-hunt. \nThis is why you do not put lawyers on the stand. They will destroy you and Annalise just owned Emily Sinclair. \nAsher continues his reign of never saying anything at the right time when Oliver shows up at the Keating house. In an attempt to show sympathy for Oliver, Asher says, “'Philadelphia' is one of my favorite movies,” inducing a collective eye-roll across America. \nOliver is rightfully so annoyed with Connor and storms off. \nIt is Eve’s turn to cross-examine Annalise on the stand and things got ugly very quickly. Eve goes for personal attacks on Annalise’s character claiming she fakes falling in love so she can lie her way out of it. Annalise is visibly upset on the stand and can barely defend herself. \nAt numerous points during this hearing, I had to question who was actually on trial. It's an awful case put forth by the prosecution and the judge recognizes this. She sends Sinclair back to the drawing board and lets Nate walk free … for now. \nAnnalise also secures a minor victory in the Hapstall case. Turns out the police swept for prints twice and planted Caleb’s DNA there the second time. Annalise, blunt as ever, tells the siblings, “Now go home and don’t kill anymore.” \nSeems like Ms. Keating does not have much faith in her clients. \nBonnie continues to whine about killing Rebecca for Annalise. She says she did it to take care of Annalise while Annalise blames herself for ruining Bonnie. Annalise then says she ruined everyone although I’m not sure if that was Annalise or the vodka talking. Bonnie leaves the house with her tail between her legs, a pattern we are quickly recognizing to be her signature exit. \nThe final 10 minutes of \"How to Get Away with Murder\" never disappoint. \nOliver reveals to Connor that it was after Connor cheated on him that he contracted HIV. Oliver was depressed, got drunk and went home with a random guy. \nConnor immediately takes the blame because Oliver would not have been in the position had Connor not have cheated. Could this hurt their relationship? I sure hope not. If they survived the diagnosis, they should be able to survive this. \nEve shows up at Annalise’s who is being stone-cold passive-aggressive. Annalise is saying, “I’m fine” but everyone knows she’s not. She yells at Eve for making things personal on the stand while Eve expresses her love for her. \nThis leads Annalise to tell her she’s “the most beautiful thing that’s ever happened” to her. So the two of them head straight to the bedroom. \nThe morning after, Eve leaves for New York while Nate is watching from the street. \nAnnalise better be careful because Nate looks like he wants to destroy her. \nMeanwhile, Sinclair once again confronts Asher in a parking garage and announces that she is the prosecutor on the Hapstall case. She has not proven to be a very good prosecutor thus far, so Annalise might have this case in the bag. \nElsewhere, Laurel invites herself over to Frank’s because she passed her exam, her excuse for ignoring him up to this point. We all know that is not the reason she is there and Frank knows this, too. \nHe pins her up against the wall and whispers what he plans to do to her … only to reject her. Did I miss when Frank became hot? That scene alone had me rooting for them to get back together again! \nIf you’re interested in me, get to know me,” he tells her, before sending her off and out of his apartment. \nFlash-forward two months and we’re back in the Hapstall house. Connor is trying to save Annalise. \nThe camera travels down the stairs to Emily Sinclair’s lifeless body and boy does it look like someone did a number on her. So now there are two murders to be solved. \nAfter this week, I’ve got my eye on Asher. Why is he always meeting up with Sinclair in parking garages? How many parking garages are there in this town? \nNext week, Annalise teaches the connection between sex and law so it will definitely be a hot episode.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T16:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:27:43.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
