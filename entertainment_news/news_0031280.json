Buy this photo \nNow, after all these years, the musical's come to Broadway for the first time. Currently in previews at the Helen Hayes Theatre, it'll open Oct. 22. \nIn the '60s and '70s, the small-scale \"Dames\" was a popular choice for productions around the country, including at Ohio State University. \n\"It was a gem,\" said Randy Skinner, who saw it there as a student. \"I thought, 'I'd like to examine that show at some point.' \" \nSkinner went on to become a choreographer and director, with a special relationship to \"42nd Street\" – whose showbiz story is similar to that of \"Dames at Sea\" – which he's staged all over the world. \n\"Dames at Sea,\" meanwhile, though still produced here and there, had mostly faded from public consciousness. \nThree years ago, however, Skinner was asked to stage the musical by the Infinity Theatre Company in Annapolis, Md. That went so well, he recalled in a phone conversation last week, that he suggested transferring the show to Broadway. \n\"With the (small) size of it, it was not going to cost a fortune to produce,\" he said. \nThe rights were obtained from the estates of the show's deceased creators, book writers-lyricists Robin Miller and George Haimsohn and composer Jim Wise (an English professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark for many years), and Skinner set about shaping the show for Broadway. \nThe production was fortunate, he said, to obtain the Helen Hayes Theatre, Broadway's smallest, with just 583 seats. \n\"I'm so thankful to have that theater,\" he said. \"Real estate is such an important piece of the puzzle in putting a production together. There's no reason to do this show if you don't have an intimate house.\" \nSkinner noted that while the Hayes is cozy for audiences, it has a fairly sizable stage, enabling him to be expansive in directing and choreographing. Not that he had that many performers to put out there. \nThe essence of the show, he said, was its human scale, which enabled the audience to connect to the actors. \nAlthough inspired by the big Busby Berkeley musicals of the 1930s, especially \"Gold Diggers of 1933,\" the twist is that there are only six performers, with no chorus. It's the movie in miniature. \nPeters' role of Ruby, a chorus girl who becomes an overnight star, is played by Eloise Kropp, in a cast with no major names. \n\"It's not a send-up or a spoof,\" said Skinner. \"It's performed truthfully. It's a valentine to those old movies, which I loved as a kid. They spoke to me.\" \nA key element in the production, he said, is that the performers all dance, expressing themselves totally, in the way that Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers communicated in their films. \nAnd there'll be plenty of the dance form that every audience loves – tapping. \nSkinner has developed a theory on why tap dancing is irresistible. \n\"It's the rhythm,\" he said. \"It's like a drumbeat. It becomes an auditory as well as a visual experience. There's just something about the sound that makes you respond to it. It's very elemental to human experience.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:36:48.431+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
