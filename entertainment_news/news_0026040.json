Despite Dylan O'Brien 's previous statement on \" Live! With Kelly and Michael \" that they stole items from the film location, 20th Century Fox insists there was no evidence of missing items from the ranch. \"Twentieth Century Fox and the entire Scorch Trials production have deep respect for the local Native American culture and environment and are sorry that any actions or statements by people involved in the production led to any suggestion that our intentions were anything but deferential or that anything was taken from the area,\" the studio says. A petition was launched after O'Brien's statement, demanding the cast to apologize and return any stolen Native American artifacts. While the actor and his camp remained silent, property manager Roch Hart clarified that the site was not home to any known Indian burial grounds. Hart also couldn't detect anything missing from the collection that included artifacts dated from 800 A.D. to 1700. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:34:56.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
