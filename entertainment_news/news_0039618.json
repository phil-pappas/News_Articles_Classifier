Khloé was ours, right?\" joked Schumer on Saturday. \"Whenever there's a group of women, you identify with one of them, right?…But Khloé -- she lost half her body weight. She lost a Kendall.\" \nOn Monday, however, the 34-year-old actress/comedienne defended her comment on Twitter , insisting, \"Nothing but love for that family. I like idea of sending women the message to be happy in their own skin.\" The tweet was accompanied by a photo of her baby niece. \nThat message was in response to Kardashian's tweet a day earlier, defending her 35-pound weight loss. \"No need 2 tear down others just 2 make urself feel bigger,\" she wrote. \"It actually makes u quite small. I'm on a healthy journey. I don't care 4the hate.\" \nThis isn't Schumer's first run-in with the Kardashians. Back in April, she belly-flopped in front of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West at the TIME 100 Gala red carpet. \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
