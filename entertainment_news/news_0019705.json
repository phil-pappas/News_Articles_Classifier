We don’t see why not. Rock isn’t at the center of the musical universe anymore, sure — maybe it’ll come back to the forefront again, maybe it won’t — but you can’t say it didn’t have a hell of a run when it was on top. And, really, it’s hard to tell if the genre’s all that much worse off for its relative marginalization. Fewer buzz bands just means less clutter and white noise around those we genuinely do care about, of which there are still enough that we spent weeks arguing while whittling this list down to 50. To claim that there’s nothing inspiring, satisfying, and even genuinely new going on within one of music’s biggest, longest-surviving umbrella genres, is just to reveal that you’re not really paying attention. And we’ve got the groups to prove it.\nBut before that, of course, we need to address the question of what qualifies as a rock band right now. Let’s take the “rock” part first, since that’s obviously the tough one. We’d love to say that we came up with some unifying theory of, uh, rockness — bands with a guitar/bass/drum setup, bands who would list “riffs” among their assets, bands who could conceivably appear on some version of the Dazed and Confused soundtrack, etc. — there’s no one designation that isn’t violated by at least one act on here.\nOur list has no shortage of rawk , but it also encompasses synth-poppers and noise mavens, one trio who takes cues from Massive Attack, and one who looks up to the Bangles and ’80s Fleetwood Mac. You might not agree with us about the eligibility of all 50 of ‘em — frankly, we’re pretty sure you won’t — but at a time when one of rock’s best attributes is its willingness to acknowledge the existence of a wider musical world, we saw no need to be overly stringent with the genre parameters.\nAs for the “band” part, well, there we were a little stricter. Obviously, bands had to have multiple members to be counted, which means that obvious solo stars like Courtney Barnett and Ty Segall were out. But we also tried to avoid nominal “bands” who were really just the studio vision of one principal performer, meaning that acts like Tame Impala , Waxahatchee , and the War on Drugs were also disqualified. To be eligible for this list, bands had to have a mostly consistent lineup from studio recording to live performance, and not just be one recording mastermind and their touring support.\nAnd finally, we’re attempting to define “right now” as the bands we happen to be most excited about at this moment in time — excited about what they’ve done most recently, and excited about what they’re going to do next. Naturally, bands who have been active in the last 12 months were given preferential treatment, though bands were considered eligible as long as they’d experienced some sort of career peak — a canonical album, a mainstream breakthrough, some other definitive moment — within the last decade. Rock’n’roll is tough to define, but fun to argue about.\nAnd now, onto the bands. Perhaps there’s an off-chance that one of them will be the one that saves rock , but collectively, they make a hell of an argument that rock doesn’t need any kind of saving anyway ...\n50. TENEMENT\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here : Punk-pop rarely gets as crafty or ambitious as this Wisconsin trio, who spike their churning crunch with unexpected chord changes and jarring melodic segues; of 2015’s sprawling Predatory Highlights the New York Times accurately said, “Every song is a puzzle.”\nWhy They’re Not Higher : Even with one of the year’s best rock albums inside of its 78 minutes, Predatory Highlights is definitely the work of a band we expect to grow into better editors.\nFinest Moment : “I’m Your Super Glue” mixes jangle and riffage like vintage Sugar. — DAN WEISS\n49. LITURGY\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here : In an era of heavy-metal history where outside-the-box ideas are met with scorn and thinly veiled fear, Liturgy have subverted and inverted extreme metal by taking it into strange new realms, from spectral music to hip-hop. Stubbornly pretentious and unflaggingly ambitious, the young innovators — led by guitarist Hunter Hunt-Hendrix — never fail at rattling purists with every release they put out.\nWhy They’re Not Higher : Although it’s admirable that Liturgy swing for the fences every time, they’re only human, and will whiff every once in a while — like when they follow their avowed impulses toward Bone Thugs-n-Harmony-styled triplet flows.\nFinest Moment : The glorious, 11-and-a-half-minute “Reign Array,” from 2015’s The Ark Work , sends basement kvlt ists scurrying with its audacious blend of black-metal tremolo picking and blastbeats. — ADRIEN BEGRAND\n48. MAKTHAVERSKAN\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here : Vocalist Maja Milner’s skyscraping vocals are the real centerpiece of this Swedish quintet’s thunderous take on post-punk’s overcast structures. Guitars roll in like real-life rainclouds, colliding with drums that smack with the impact of a car crash on a freshly slicked road.\nWhy They’re Not Higher : They’re still on the upswing of their career — a recent tour 7″ was the most affecting recording they’ve released to date. A few members of the band also have their attention split with another project called Westkust, whose dusky riffage makes its own case for inclusion on a list like this one.\nFinest Moment : The gothy avalanche of “Witness.” — COLIN JOYCE\n47. ALABAMA SHAKES\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here : Initially gaining buzz — and, eventually, a Grammy nod for Best Rock Performance — with “Hold On,” the Athens, Atlanta quartet Alabama Shakes started huge with 2012’s Boys and Girls . Fronted by powerhouse/badass Brittany Howard (whose bombastic voice and achingly personal songwriting elevates the group to the next level), the Shakes have become one of the most popular non-legacy rock bands in the country with this year’s Billboard 200-topping Sound & Color .\nWhy They’re Not Higher: The Shakes have only put out two records, the first of which serves more as a Brittany Howard delivery system than a showcase of the band’s obvious collaborative talent. Not the biggest problem — few involving Howard are less than great — but it mostly repeats the same handful of notes.\nFinest Movement : Sound & Color is one of the most wonderfully unique rock records of the past five years; the Electric Lady to Boys and Girls ’ Muscle Shoals. — CONNOR O’BRIEN\n46. SHOPPING\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here : Among the post-punk revivalists cluttering the underground rock landscape of 2015, few are as fun — or seem to be having as much fun — as British trio Shopping . Their revived ’79 to ’82 isn’t a place of dour industrial landscapes and overcast, desolate seasides, but instead the coolest basement dance club in the U.K., where those fed up with the powers that be can assemble to shake that fascist groove thang .\nWhy They’re Not Higher : As good a time as they have invoking their Thatcher-era heroes, the band has yet to forge much of a musical signature of their own.\nFinest Moment : The work-out punk-funk of “Take It Outside,” from this year’s Why Choose. — ANDREW UNTERBERGER\n45. THE 1975\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here : Amidst a sadly dwindling number of legitimate heartthrobs in rock, British quartet the 1975 prove that boys with guitars can still get the teens screaming. They earn those shrieks, too: The band’s self-titled 2013 debut LP was chock full of candy-coated potential crossover smashes, as nervy and energetic as Arctic Monkeys and as smooth and delectable as Hall and Oates — like a Maroon 5 album where every song was as undeniable as “This Love.”\nWhy They’re Not Higher : The lyrics, uh, aren’t quite there yet, making hits like “Chocolate” (“Now run, run away from the boys in blue / Oh, my car smells like chocolate”) less enjoyable the closer you listen to them.\nFinest Moment : Probably the “Girls” video, which cements the band’s place in the pop/rock landscape: halfway between One Direction and the Strokes. — A.U.\n44. PURE X\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here : Few bands cover as much emotional ground as the quartet of Texans formerly known as Pure Ecstasy have over the course of their three full-length records. They can evoke the anthemic highs their name suggests on drugged up Bee Gees ballads like “Heaven,” but they can also do pure agony just as compellingly.\nWhy They’re Not Higher : For all their blunted disaffection, they’ve still yet to put out a record that clearly depicts and integrates both impulses.\nFinest Moment: But both sides are at least evident in the wonderfully disorienting bildungsroman Crawling Up the Stairs . — C.J.\n43. SCREAMING FEMALES\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here : Led by tiny dynamo Marissa Paternoster, the New Jersey trio play boisterous yet melodic indie rock in the great tradition of Hüsker Dü and Dinosaur Jr. If you’re going to make rock music influenced by those titans, you’d better bring the riffs, and over the course of six albums and numerous EPs and singles, Paternoster has emerged as one of the most powerful guitarists of her generation.\nWhy They’re Not Higher : As strong as 2012’s Ugly and 2015’s Rose Mountain are, fans are still waiting for Screaming Females ’ own Zen Arcade , that perfect balance between raucousness and melody that everyone knows they have in them.\nFinest Moment: The seven-and-a-half-minute Ugly centerpiece “Doom 84” is beastly, featuring a towering performance by Paternoster, as she hammers out blues-rock riffs that few of her male indie rock peers have the guts and chops to pull off. — A.B.\n42. SHEER MAG\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here : Because no DIY act has ever strut like this before. Christina Halladay’s barnstorming stage presence and surprisingly conscious lyrics (“Fan the Flames” trashes a yuppie landlord) makes the Thin Lizzy guitar-isms and Cheap Trick stadium choruses of these Philadelphians more than a great gimmick.\nWhy They’re Not Higher : Even bands of Herculean hookcraft will need more than two crud-fi EPs — all that Sheer Mag currently has to their discography — to ascend to Valhalla.\nFinest Moment : “Button Up” is one of the year’s finest anthems, and it sounds like it was recorded for $10. — D.W.\n41. ICEAGE\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here : Frontman Elias Bender Ronnenfelt is a brooding punk poet overflowing with the wonderfully self-destructive impulses of a young Nick Cave, and the rest of his band are no slackers either. Their corroded take on post-punk structures mutated last year into horn-laden goth-country as unsettling as it is endearingly rootsy.\nWhy They’re Not Higher : Until the high drama of 2014’s Plowing Into the Fields of Love , they’d yet to fully distinguish themselves from their acid-burned influences.\nFinest Moment : “Morals,” from 2012’s You’re Nothing , distills their genre-hopping impulses into a three-and-a-half-minute mess. — C.J.\n40. CHUMPED\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here: First and foremost, the members of this Brooklyn band are fantastic songwriters: 2014’s Teenage Retirement in particular is a near-perfect combination of effervescent pop-punk, Pixies-esque spiky indie rock and Letters To Cleo-style sugary alt-pop. Chumped’s lyrics, which touch on romantic angst, existential crises, and uncertainty about life choices, hit the rawest of nerves for their painful universality.\nWhy They’re Not Higher: After a flurry of promotion and shows in the wake of Teenage Retirement , Chumped have been maintaining a lower profile in recent months and sticking closer to home.\nFinest Moment: Last year’s Teenage Retirement . — A.Z.\n39. BEACH SLANG\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here : Beach Slang are eternal optimists who skip lyrical platitudes and instead insist — with clear-eyed determination tinged with wisdom and experience — that hard times, broken hearts, and hopeless situations are manageable, temporary stumbles. The Philadelphia band cements this glass-half-full mindset with uplifting, Jawbreaker-meets-Replacements (with a side of the Psychedelic Furs) rock righteousness.\nWhy They’re Not Higher : Although Beach Slang consist of music-scene vets, they’re still early in their career: The band merely has two EPs to their name, and their debut album, The Things We Do To Find People Who Feel Like Us , isn’t even out until October 30.\nFinest Moment: “American Girls and French Kisses,” from the Cheap Thrills On A Dead End Street EP. — ANNIE ZALESKI\n38. FORTH WANDERERS\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here : This group of Montclair, New Jersey kids (all of whom were teens when they released their placid debut full-length Tough Love at the tail end of last year) have a knack for nailing the misty-eyed mysticism of Built to Spill’s early LPs. No wonder Lorde shouted them out even before they released that debut.\nWhy They’re Not Higher : They’re in school and even a year ago they were hinting at the end of their band , so they could just as easily break up as release another heartbreaking record.\nFinest Moment : The entirety of Tough Love . — C.J.\n37. TV ON THE RADIO\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here: The darkly mid-war Return to Cookie Mountain and funkily post-war Dear Science are rightly celebrated — SPIN named them both Album of the Year in 2006 and 2008 , respectively — but 2011’s lovelorn Nine Types of Light and 2014’s sweetly cruising Seeds deserved more attention than they got. This band has yet to dip.\nWhy They’re Not Higher : But those last two albums didn’t exactly set the world on fire either.\nFinest Moment : Try the funk-metal “Caffienated Consciousness” or the tender “Will Do” for recent stuff every bit as good as their 2000s output. — D.W.\n36. GIRL BAND\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here : Few live acts are as capable of recreating the feeling of watching the napalm invasion from Apocalypse Now as this Irish quartet, whose megaphoned shrieks, guitar squalls, bass bombs, and drums of death combine for a uniquely visceral and violent experience.\nWhy They’re Not Higher : They’ve created one sublime LP of noise-rock cacophony ( Holding Hands With Jamie ) and one collected EP of nihilist-disco superjams ( The Early Years ), but the album that fully integrates their strengths into one nation-leveling masterwork will be what puts them over the top.\nFinest Moment : The eight-minute cover of Blawan’s “Why They Hide Their Bodies Under My Garage,” making a brilliantly inscrutable post-garage banger even more perplexing and enthralling. — A.U.\n35. HOP ALONG\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here: The Philly-based quartet of Mark and Frances Quinlan, Tyler Long, and Joe Reinhart push accessibility’s boundaries on sophomore LP Painted Shut , which seamlessly skirts the middle ground between fuzzy guitar-pop and vertigo-inducing rhythms. Even more jarring (and appealing) is Frances’ octave-swinging, hair-raising rasp.\nWhy They’re Not Higher: With only two albums to their name, Hop Along have only just begun to hit their stride as a band.\nFinest Moment: “I Saw My Twin,” a gently loping Painted Shut standout about finding your doppelgänger at the Waffle House. — RACHEL BRODSKY\n34. YOUNG FATHERS\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here : Unless you beat an early TV on the Radio record to shards and have El-P remix the mess, no one else sounds like these art-damaged Scots, who rap, croon, and layer programmed elements so well that 2014’s Dead unexpectedly earned them the Mercury Prize over FKA twigs and other notables. This year’s White Men Are Black Men Too is even better.\nWhy They’re Not Higher : Their songs work best as parts in the great sum of their oddball albums, so don’t expect a fluke ballad or anything truly groundbreaking — just bet on these guys further burrowing into their own compelling sound.\nFinest Moment : You know you want to find out what White Men Are Black Men Too is all about. — D.W.\n33. BARONESS\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here : Emerging from the Savannah, Georgia punk/metal scene, Baroness initially made waves among the metal crowd with a series of EPs that focused on a sludgy sound similar to that of Mastodon and Kylesa. But since 2007’s The Red Album , the band has steadily drifted out of the metal gutter towards a more all-inclusive hybrid bridging heavy music, classic rock, and indie rock, yielding a series of albums that have improved significantly with each release.\nWhy They’re Not Higher : A bus crash in England put a damper on the promotion of the brilliant Yellow & Green in late 2012, but with Metallica’s management behind them, a revamped lineup, and a fourth album on the way in December, crossover success is only a matter of time now.\nFinest Moment : “Chlorine & Wine,” from 2015’s upcoming Purple , is the most fully-realized example of what Baroness is all about, displaying a level of texture that Metallica only hinted at on the Black Album and building to a glorious climax reminiscent of mid-‘70s Queen. — A.B.\n32. DESTRUCTION UNIT\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here : These Arizona art-punks have slipped and tripped their way from a Reatards off-shoot to being one of the country’s preeminent live punk acts , shredding vocal cords and destroying amp speakers in countless treks cross country. Their recent records for Sacred Bones have been their best yet, brickwalled documents of addled noiseniks pushing themselves to the very limit.\nWhy They’re Not Higher : As fuzzed-out and blood-stained as their records are, they’ve still not been able to quite match the continuous thunder of their live show.\nFinest Moment : Every single live set. Seriously, go see them. — C.J.\n31. GIRLPOOL\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here : Managing a singular sound within the world of 2015 indie rock is a near-impossibility, but Girlpool achieved it simply by stripping down to just plaintive guitar, supportive bass, and the piercing intertwined vocals of Harmony Tividad and Clea Tucker. Their 2014 self-titled debut EP was attention-grabbing for its snotty teenage breakdowns of lame-dude predatoriness and hypocrisy, but 2015 full-length Before The World Was Big was even more stunning for its sudden crisis in confidence when faced with a world of open possibility.\nWhy They’re Not Higher : Let ‘em reach legal-drinking age before we start putting these kinds of demands on them.\nFinest Moment : After the opening lines of Before ’s title track (“ 7:45 IN THE MORRR-NING! “), you’re guaranteed to get the duo stuck in your head at least once a day. — A.U.\n30. FUTURE ISLANDS\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here : Samuel T. Herring’s invigorating dance moves reached a critical cultural mass when Baltimore’s melancholic emerging synth-poptimists made their immediately viral TV debut with the soulful “Seasons (Waiting On You)” on Letterman — and the inimitable host then imitated them. While such moments are Internet-famous, their fourth album, 2014’s urgent, soaring (and, for the first time, Billboard-charting) Singles , will never stop feeding us daily soul with its #feels-inducing melodies and bouncing kick drum.\nWhy They’re Not Higher : For the simple and arbitrary reason that life isn’t fair, only the good die young, and other vaguely comforting aphorisms. Seriously though, Future Islands are a little too intense for the mainstream: Herring’s deep-throaty growl and spastic stage presence is not for the faint of heart, especially while their elegies to new wave squeeze that particular organ so continually.\nFinest Moment : Beyond the obvious choice , “Tin Man” from 2010’s In Evening Air was an early highlight. — HARLEY BROWN\n29. TORCHE\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here : For a metal band to crunch and soar in equal measure is all too rare, but Torche manage to ascend to the heavens while also quaking the earth below with their dual-guitar jetstreams. They don’t mind throwing in a little hair-metal strut into their Maiden-esque majesty, either — how many rock bands of any genre would have the balls to title a single-worthy song “Loose Men”?\nWhy They’re Not Higher : This year’s Restarter might not quite be the equal of 2012’s Harmonicraft in pinball-machine sonic exuberance, though it’s no less grandiose for its relative torpidity.\nFinest Moment : “Out Again” from 2010’s Songs for Singles EP, the most epic of the band’s many scorched-earth album closers. — A.U.\n28. OUGHT\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here : Formed in Montreal in 2012, the Canadian-via-New Hampshire quartet has released two stellar albums in as many years. Last year’s More Than Any Other Day and last month’s Sun Coming Down revel in post-punk expressionism, accented by Tim Darcy’s Fred Schneider-esque delivery and wry lyrics that accent the band’s angular guitar shapes wonderfully.\nWhy They Aren’t Higher : These guys have barely been together for three years, so there isn’t a huge amount of material out there. However, with two extraordinary records out in quick succession, the future looks bright.\nFinest Moment : “Big Beautiful Sky” from Sun Coming Down , Darcy’s sarcastic, high-school screed against small talk and how it distracts from thinking about death. — C.O.B.\n27. THE BODY\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here : In recent years they’ve been happy to collaborate with any similarly dispositioned metal act, but that’s just about the only thing that this Providence-born noise-metal duo will do with a smile on their face. Their seeping take on sewer-dwelling doom has become only gloomier and more nihilistic with time, coming to a low (or high, depending on how you’re looking at it) point with their austere solo collection Christs, Redeemers in 2013. Few do depression better.\nWhy They’re Not Higher : Their best work to date (2014’s I Shall Die Here with the Haxan Cloak and this year’s You, Whom I Have Always Hated with Thou) has come with the help of outside forces.\nFinest Moment : The gnashing terror of “Hail to Thee, Everlasting Pain.” — C.J.\n26. DIRTY PROJECTORS\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here : Of all the acts to break out in the landmark indie year of 2009 — Animal Collective, Phoenix, Grizzly Bear — Dave Longstreth’s bizarro choir is the one that most sound like virtuosos on their instruments, having followed an alt-R&B blog hit (“Stillness Is the Move”) and a Björk collabo ( Mount Wittenberg Orca ) with their most melodic and trickiest album yet, 2012’s Swing Lo Magellan .\nWhy They’re Not Higher : It’s been three years since their last release. Get it together, DPs.\nFinest Moment : Swing Lo remains one of the twistiest aural experiences of the 2010s, and it didn’t forget the love songs. — D.W.\n25. WOLF EYES\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here : The long-running Detroit noise outfit has mutated forms over the years, spinning off multiple avant godheads in their own right (former members Jason Lescaleet and Mike Connelly have gone onto relative solo acclaim), but the gutter-noise parent act has reached baffling heights as they’ve slowly massaged their freakouts into song-like structures that they’re (facetiously) calling Trip Metal. To wit, their latest album will see release on Jack White’s Third Man Records — no, it doesn’t really make sense to anyone else.\nWhy They’re Not Higher : Brutal electronic blasts and relentless in-jokes have a popularity ceiling.\nFinest Moment: “Stabbed in the Face” from 2004 is the hit, relatively speaking, but 2013’s ​ No Answer: Lower Floors​ was every bit as terrifying through subtler means. — C.J.\n24. ARCTIC MONKEYS\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here : How easy it would have been for Arctic Monkeys to go from buzz-band to has-beens. Instead, the Brits followed their precocious debut — 2006’s Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not — with a string of albums that are better than most Yanks will admit, culminating in 2013’s AM , a brooding and intoxicating set that draws just as much from TLC and Drake as it does Queens of the Stone Age and Black Sabbath. Doesn’t hurt that frontman Alex Turner has the substance to support his style, either — guy has the slickest hair and sharpest pen of anyone in the game right now.\nWhy They’re Not Higher : No solid word yet on LP No. 6, and those knowingly in vogue reference points mentioned above aren’t quite as novel now as they were two years ago. Here’s hoping yet another reinvention is in the works.\nFinest Moment : As adored as their first full-length is, it’s AM that proved this was a band whose best days might still be ahead of them. — KYLE MCGOVERN\n23. BULLY\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here : “I remember getting too f up / And I remember throwing up.” That unforgivingly blunt line alone, sung in frontwoman Alicia Bognanno’s feral, raw shriek — which, one bar later, dips into a sultry exhale before spiking back up into the red — opens the Nashville alt heroes’ all-killer debut LP, Feels Like , and is universally identifiable enough to be reason alone for the band’s placement here.\nWhy They’re Not Higher : Even though Bognanno sounds like she could have been writing songs since Gina sang “Sugar High” in 1995’s Empire Records , Bully’s debut LP came out this year. They’ve got some time to go before shredding on rooftop stages.\nFinest Moment : “Trying.” — H.B.\n22. INTER ARMA\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here : An hour and change isn’t nearly enough to contain the widescreen sprawl and explosive imagination found in the eight tracks of 2013’s Sky Burial , a jaw-dropping LP that mixes black, stoner, and prog metal influences with Allmans bluesiness and Pink Floyd cohesion. To their credit, the band’s next effort adjusted the tracks-to-length ratio accordingly, with the still-captivating 46-minute, single-song release “The Cavern.”\nWhy They’re Not Higher : For whatever reason, the band has yet to experience a moment of Sunbather -like crit-crossover. It’s coming.\nDefinitive Moment : The Beatles -like static enveloping “The Long Road (Iron Gate),” as it transitions into the dusky power-balladry of “The Long Road Home” on the Burial A-side. — A.U.\n21. DOWNTOWN BOYS\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here : Led by the irrepressible Victoria Ruiz, the hard-charging Downtown Boys confront privilege and awareness ( “Tall Boys” ), racial inequality ( “Monstro” ), police killings ( “Wave of History” ), and more societal ills, as Ruiz oscillates between English and Spanish chants to ensure no civic stone goes unturned. The band’s live shows are particularly riotous, Ruiz refusing to let the crowd be passive participants in the experience, with motivational-speaker energy and cult-leader charisma.\nWhy They’re Not Higher : Downtown Boys’ radical leftism might be difficult to ignore, but it can get a little numbing after the 1,029th sax blast.\nFinest Momen t: The band’s blistering 2015 debut, Full Communism . — R.B.\n20. ROYAL HEADACHE\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here: No small feat to capture the agony and the ecstasy of a rock’n’roll lifestyle in 2015 the way Shogun and his Australian crew of garage-punks do. The mononym’d frontman’s soul-baring vocals demand your immediate attention on both of the band’s hook-heavy LPs (2011’s self-titled and the recently released — and much improved — High ), which wisely confront broken rock-star dreams ( “My Own Fantasy” ) and what happens after success ( “Another World” ).\nWhy They’re Not Higher: One flawless album does not a No. 1 rock band make. All they need is more time.\nFinest Moment: Easily their cleaner, tighter sophomore record, which shone a fluorescent light on the group’s shared anxieties. — R.B.\n19. JOYCE MANOR\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here : They jam econo, and then some: Joyce Manor’s three studio LPs clock in at a combined 29 songs and 50 minutes. They’re no less affecting for their brevity, though — lamenting frayed friendships (“Leather Jacket”), diving head first into crushes (“Falling in Love Again”), and wearing their hearts on both their sleeves and their skin (“Heart Tattoo”) with brilliant precision and refreshing alacrity.\nWhy They’re Not Higher : Not everyone wants to be reminded of the emotions and moments that Joyce Manor relay with such unnerving detail, even just for 18 minutes at a time.\nFinest Moment : Finding new depths of nostalgia and hurt to plumb in the Buggles’ beyond-played new-wave classic “Video Killed the Radio Star” would surely rank among any band’s greatest accomplishments. — A.U.\n18. JAPANDROIDS\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here : It is truly hard to not love an album called Celebration Rock , though they thankfully filled it with fist-pumping all-timers to match: “The House That Heaven Built,” “Fire’s Highway” and “Younger Us” are merely three examples of one guitarist and one drummer taking two-man noise to its joyous limit.\nWhy They’re Not Higher : Despite rumors of Japandroids tinkering away on their breathlessly awaited follow up to Celebration Rock , the duo hasn’t been heard from since 2012.\nFinest Moment : “The House That Heaven Built” remains the geetar rollercoaster to adjudge all subsequent 2010s rock by. — D.W.\n17. CLOUD NOTHINGS\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here (and Nowhere Else): Singer/guitarist Dylan Baldi’s wildly catchy gloom-punk peaked on Cloud Nothings’ two most recent LPs, the panicked grandiosity of 2012’s Attack on Memory and last year’s cacophonous Here and Nowhere Else . The three-piece had such a high-profile 2014 that even brother in lo-fi arms Wavves’ Nathan Williams grabbed Baldi this year to record the joint mini-LP No Life for Me , a totally respectable move…\nWhy They’re Not Higher: …save for the fact that fans might’ve preferred another round of Baldi tunes with his power trio.\nFinest Moment: Put “I’m Not a Part of Me” on repeat. — R.B.\n16. BEACH HOUSE\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here : Ever since the clear-skies-ahead bird calls that unfold “Silver Soul” — highlight of their 2010 mainstream breakout, Teen Dream — Beach House have become synonymous with truly dreamy (and dreamlike) indie-pop. Victoria Legrand’s husky exhales and extended vowels, along with Alex Scally’s clouds of keyboard melody and whammy’d guitar, are melodic yet spacious enough to evoke, and subsequently buoy, the most emotional of day dreams. Oh, and they released a pretty good album this year — and a second one less than two months later.\nWhy They’re Not Higher : Listening to Beach House’s lethargic BPMs and indiscernible lyrics requires a lot of something not many people seem to have these days: time. With only wafts of big hooks and bigger bass, if any, the Baltimore duo capture only those willing to let themselves sink into the subtly conducted atmospherics.\nFinest Moment : The one-two punch of Teen Dream and its as-good (if not arguably better) follow-up, 2012’s Bloom . — H.B.\n15. SUNN 0)))\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here : The cloaked Seattle mystics distill noxious sludge metal to its grimiest components — bass riffs are stretched and slowed to distant drones that pulse like blood and run like pure primordial slime. But for all of the grim suggestions, their best records feel like revelations — complete with incantatory vocals from a host of collaborators (usually Atilla Csihar from Mayhem and Tormentor, but also Boris, noise guitarist Oren Ambarchi, and warped ex-crooner Scott Walker). The LPs remind that there’s ritual, religiosity, and earth-shaking power even in evil.\nWhy They’re Not Higher : Stephen O’Malley and Greg Anderson really only make rock in the loosest sense — there are guitars, bass, and synth onstage but it’s music largely free from genre reference points.\nFinest Moment : The totemic grind of their 2009 album Monoliths & Dimensions . — C.J.\n14. CHASTITY BELT\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here : Four college friends form a band, graduate to a boutique label (Seattle’s Hardly Art ), and assemble songs equal parts tuneful and thoughtful that play with genre (surf-rock and post-punk blur together beautifully) and spotlight level-headed gender politics (“We just wanna have fun / Grind up on everyone”). That they do so with a sense of humor (see: the press photo above) and notes of melancholy (hear: the dull ache that pervades their latest full-length) only underlines the achievement.\nWhy They’re Not Higher : As rewarding as Chastity Belt’s two albums are, this is still a band that’s just two LPs into their career; assuming there will be future iterations of this list, let’s leave room for further advancement.\nFinest Moment : Time to Go Home , released back in March, remains an obsession and likely will for years to come. — K.M.\n13. CHROMATICS\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here : Filmmaker or no, Chromatics visionary Johnny Jewel looms as one of the best directors we have right now, a master of both mood and suspense. (That electric tension when you can’t tell if the night ahead is doomed or filled with promise? That’s his forte.) And he’s every bit as skilled at timeline trickery as Tarantino: The Portland outfit’s fusion of post-punk rhythms and synth sheen feels simultaneously retro, futuristic, and distinctly of the moment.\nWhy They’re Not Higher : Last December, Chromatics announced that Dear Tommy , the long-awaited follow-up to 2012’s Kill for Love , would be out “in time for Valentine’s Day” — of which year, we’re not sure.\nFinest Moment : After Dark 2 contribution “Cherry,” with its cloaked-in-smoke cool and slow-motion sex appeal. — K.M.\n12. HAIM\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here: A literal lifetime of playing together — first in cover bands with their parents and later as a trio — has served the sisters HAIM well. Their shared DNA could certainly explain how their combined vocals harmonize so memorably and seamlessly, but Alana, Este, and Danielle’s varied musical tastes — pop, R&B, classic rock — have indirectly forced the mainstream to shake up its sonic homogeny. Plus it never hurts to be friends with Taylor Swift .\nWhy They’re Not Higher: It’s been two — almost three — years since Days Are Gone . Please put out another album.\nFinest Moment : Their impossibly slick tour de force debut LP — though career-wise, it’s probably opening arena dates for the leader of their #girlsquad. — R.B.\n11. SPOON\n© Provided by Spin Why They’re Here : The Austin five-piece’s spindly riffs and fat kick-drum footfalls are the black skinny jeans of rock: sleek, f**kin’ rad, and endlessly adaptable, yet instantly recognizable. Britt Daniel’s twitchy coo still sounds like he’s chain-smoking to avoid a nervous breakdown, as they’ve graduated from Telephono ’s slacker grunge in 1996 to, nearly 20 years later, the drily strummed ennui of They Want My Soul — all without breaking a string.\nWhy They’re Not Higher : Ever since their middle finger to the major labels, 1998’s A&R suit-parodying “The Agony of Laffitte,” Spoon have been the poster men for indie rock. Like the food pyramid, they’re classic, essential… but Middle America wants the the Big Macs.\nFinest Moment : The band’s four songs that appear in the quirky 2006 Will Ferrell comedy Stranger Than Fiction , a perfect match for the band’s left-but-not-too-left-of-center sensibilities. —\nH.B.\n10. SWANS\n© Provided by Spin You probably didn’t have to imagine longtime Swans fans rolling their eyes at the unprecedented amount of attention the great experimental-rock band have received since 2010. No, you saw them at the record store or at a show remarking about how most people aren’t familiar with the streamlined post-punk of The Great Annihilator , the gothic majesty of Children of God , or the harrowing noise of Filth . The fact is, though, while all three are classic albums, you don’t have to be well versed in those records to understand what Michael Gira and Co. have created on their last three opuses.\nMake no mistake, seasoned listeners hear facets of every era of Swans’ long history on their most-recent masterpieces, 2012’s The Seer and 2014’s To Be Kind (and, to a lesser extent, 2010’s My Father Will Guide Me up a Rope to the Sky ). But Swans sound so much more sprawling, more cinematic today that you can’t help but wonder how it was even possible for the music’s intensity and range to grow so much. Still, neophytes find it plenty rewarding to blindly dive into those two latest masterpieces and lose themselves in the catharsis, the horror, the pain, the redemption. No matter your perspective, great music is universal, and everyone who experiences Swans on record or in person comes out of the experience completely shattered, and best of all, equals. — A.B.\n9. PARAMORE\n© Provided by Spin Let’s face it, even if you enjoy the Black Keys, Kings of Leon, Cage the Elephant, or whomever, this is a pretty crappy era for Rock Stars™, with both personality and artistic achievement becoming rarified as ever among acts who can actually fill a stadium. Enter Hayley Williams, who’s got star charisma and sass to spare, inspiring none other than Taylor Swift to attempt revenge-punk homageon 2010’s conspicuously “Misery Business” -esque “Better Than Revenge.” Most importantly, Paramore’s songs have gotten better as they’ve grown in popularity. Starting with too-good-for-emo standouts like “That’s What You Get,” they began carving quartz-hard hooks out of tougher sounds for 2009’s Brand New Eyes and blew the walls off entirely for 2013’s Paramore , which went to No. 1 for great reasons, like the too-adorable “Still Into You” and the gospel-climaxed powerhouse “Ain’t It Fun.” But the epic “(One of Those) Crazy Girls,” which owes the Brill Building and Weezer alike, reaches classic status solely because of Williams. — D.W.\n8. TITUS ANDRONICUS\n© Provided by Spin What was the most ambitious thing you did this year? Yeah, sure, very nice, but here’s the most ambitious thing that Titus Andronicus nerve center Patrick Stickles did this year: poured 30 years of life experience and struggle with manic depression into 2015’s most sprawling and ragged rock album, a five-act, quasi-autobiographical opera that spans 29 tracks and 93 minutes, that finds room for a clutch Seinfeld shout-out and a haunting interpretation of “Auld Lang Syne,” that relishes in splashy piano licks and weary guitar sprints. The Most Lamentable Tragedy is so bold and uncompromising that it has retroactively turned 2010’s The Monitor — a critically lauded concept album infused with Civil War imagery — into Titus’ second-most challenging and grandiose LP; that’s no small feat.\nTo those with a soft spot for rock’n’roll ideology — be it arena or indie — Titus Andronicus are likely the keepers of the flame; to less sentimental types (or those actively looking to kill the previous generation’s idols) they probably represent everything that’s exhausting and outmoded about rock music. This is the kind of band that inspires reactions that strong — and sentences this overstuffed. Their mixture of self-indulgence and sincere sense of camaraderie is both their appeal and repellant; their overzealous dedication to the airing of grievances is both their fatal flaw and their greatest asset. — K.M.\n7. DEAFHEAVEN\n© Provided by Spin There aren’t enough bands whose very existence is upsetting to people. That used to be the case for Deafheaven, the San Franciscan act led by the core duo of guitarist Kerry McCoy and vocalist George Clarke, whose omnivorous approach to black metal’s curdled atmospheres and astoundingly normal stage presence (that is, sans corpse paint) constantly ruffled feathers in the traditionalist scene that birthed them. Still, as the years have passed, the haters have either shut up or been drowned out by the band’s airliner-engine take on shoegazing guitars and squelched vocals. Deafheaven have grown more gnarled, intricate, and affecting as the acclaim from outside the metal community continues to pour in, a sign of the Internet era’s blurring lines between listeners. They’re the most successful suggestion that there’s room in a record collection for both Bathory and Souvlaki — and if purists are unwilling to acknowledge the slippage, well, they can just play louder. — C.J.\n6. PROTOMARTYR\n© Provided by Spin The power of Protomartyr is best demonstrated in a lyric like the repeated “The eyes of Kayrouz are upon you!,” delivered over wire-taut bass and uneasily cascading drums on “Dope Cloud.” Like all of masterful parent album The Agent Intellect , you know how it feels (cold, foreboding, but maybe a little comforting in its own cynical way) before you actually know what it really says , the fact that it’s a reference to an omnipresent Detroit billboard can mean exactly as much as you want it to. Led by thirty-something frontman Joe Casey, these four purveyors of Motor City moroseness have reached a place where their post-punk-derived (but singularly voiced) greyscale rock hits you in the gut before it flatters your intellect, like a pub encounter with a stranger who starts a fight with you for no reason before getting you to really think about James Joyce. Simultaneously the most jaded and the least defeated band in America, Protomartyr are the best evidence this century that you only get more punk as you grow older. — A.U.\n5. AGAINST ME!\n© Provided by Spin “Come on and ache with me,” Laura Jane Grace offered on one of the best songs on 2010’s underrated White Crosses . It was a beautiful sentiment; sympathetic and lived. But it wasn’t nearly good enough for Grace, who — after publicly announcing herself as transgender in 2012 — came roaring back with 2014’s Transgender Dysphoria Blues , now demanding that you cry, sweat, and bleed with her as well. The album more than earned all three, Grace mixing guttural howls about her lifelong displacement with gorgeous, Morrissey-like meditations on death and isolation, while her band blasted through one of the tightest collections of rockabilly-indebted punk rock since X’s Los Angeles . And as Grace predicted (“Imagine me, six-foot-two, in heels, f**king screaming into someone’s face”), the band has only become more ferocious live, as ably boasted by this year’s blistering double-LP set, 23 Live Sex Acts . “Do you remember when you were young and wanted to set the world on fire?” the singer asked on another White Crosses highlight . Nearly 20 years into their career, Against Me! continue to actually do so on a nightly basis. — A.U.\n4. PARQUET COURTS\n© Provided by Spin “Everyday it starts… everyday it starts… anxiety,” is how Parquet Courts ’ alter ego Parkay Quarts began 2014’s Content Nausea , the last thing we heard from either incarnation. Because yeah, queasy energy is this band’s biodiesel. Their oft-cited forebears Pavement and the Minutemen had a confidence about their noise, like they knew something we didn’t, and we had to play along like we did to keep up. But Parquet Courts stammer out everything they know, like they’re being bawled out in an interrogation, with frantic two-chord music to match on songs like “Sunbathing Animal” and “The More It Works.” Andrew Savage’s non-voice only makes the tender moments — the taffy-pulled epics “Uncast Shadow of a Southern Myth” and “Instant Disassembly” — more relatable, if not, dare we say, sweeter. It’s numbing to keep comparing them to Pavement and the Minutemen, fellow standard-bearers whose scrappiness kept their endless run of quality product surprising, but in the 2010s? No one’s doing better at what even the stingiest arbiters of the term consider “indie rock.” — D.W.\n3. VAMPIRE WEEKEND\n© Provided by Spin “The world has spoken, and it prefers genuine fakes to fake genuines,” Ezra Koenig told former Hipster Runoff mastermind (and forever hipster icon) Carles recently. “Mid-2000s indie was full of fake genuines.” You could say the same thing about his band, Vampire Weekend , the so-called “Upper West Side Soweto” four-piece that launched a thousand Afro-pop appropriation thinkpieces before graduating, just five years later, to performing for a packed Barclays Center in downtown Brooklyn. The world has also aged, and so too has the New York-centric band: Their most recent album and crowning achievement, Modern Vampires of the City , affirmed life while questioning age with burnished orchestral swells and the footfall rhythm of summertime strolls in the West Village. Songwriters Koenig and multi-instrumentalist maestro (and dosa enthusiast) Rostam Batmanglij have reached an existential singularity that’s more than a genuine fake — it’s the voice of the most self-doubting generation. — H.B.\n2. SLEATER-KINNEY\n© Provided by Spin When Sleater-Kinney returned after nearly a decade away, the trio didn’t miss a beat: 2015’s No Cities To Love was an especially poignant, pointed rumination on the complexity of emotional and social power dynamics, and the restorative abilities of strong friendships. Perhaps even more tellingly, the trio emerged from their hiatus as an even better live band than they were before — a rather impressive feat, considering the group was historically ferocious to begin with. Chalk this up to the innate, almost psychic chemistry between each member of the trio: Corin Tucker’s guttural shrieks seamlessly intertwine with Carrie Brownstein’s forceful yelps, while the pair’s needling (but fluid) fuzz-punk and blues-tinged guitars enhance Janet Weiss’s take-no-prisoners drumming. The members of Sleater-Kinney are constantly challenging themselves — and audience members — to refuse the status quo and always strive for forward motion and progress. — A.Z.\n1. DEERHUNTER\n© Provided by Spin If list-making is like fantasy football — and, according to Bradford Cox, it is — then Deerhunter have supreme bragging rights. A decade deep into their lifespan, the Atlanta foursome — led by Cox and anchored by guitarist/sometimes singer Lockett Pundt, bassist Josh McKay, and drummer Moses Archuleta — have established themselves as the most consistently compelling rock band of the 21st century. Every Deerhunter album has its own distinct identity and color palette, whether it’s the neon-red fury that dominated 2013’s Monomania or the hypnotic, deep-purple ambiance that distinguished 2007’s Cryptograms . “I’m not a control freak,” Cox tells SPIN over the phone, acknowledging the perception that he’s an art-rock eccentric prone to micromanagement. “I just have a high standard.”\nIt shows. Deerhunter are by no means the only act to change directions from album to album, but no other rock band — certainly no other rock band to emerge in the Internet age — pinballs between extremes quite so furiously or successfully. Their debut, 2005’s audaciously titled Turn It Up Faggot , introduced Cox as a noise-rock aficionado fascinated with crucifixion imagery; the breakout, Cryptograms , grew from that cesspool but preferred to wallow in throbbing psychedelia and tape loops; 2008’s double helping — the mostly straightforward and satisfying Microcastle and its consciously avant companion, Weird Era Cont. — represented a bid to be taken seriously and rise above the comments-section gossip that dogged the band upon their entrance to minor fame; for their magnum opus, 2010’s Halcyon Digest , Deerhunter bathed in spectral dream-pop and fashioned one of the most acclaimed rock albums this decade has seen; its confrontational successor, Monomania , searched for salvation in self-lacerating garage-rock. Now we have another stylistic pivot with the serene-seeming Fading Frontier , which continues the band’s career-length winning streak.\nA crude reading of the new record would categorize it as Deerhunter’s mid-life album, wherein they settle into themselves and “grow up” — the subtext being they become kinda boring. It’s a storyline — artist makes a difficult record, experiences a life-changing incident (in this case, he was hit by a car while walking his dog last December), then makes a comforting record — that the 33-year-old Cox takes exception to.\n“We’re leaning too much into ‘Bradford is happy’ narrative,” he counters, adding that life isn’t so neat that your problems are suddenly solved once you reach a certain age and get comfortable spending your nights at home. “You have anxiety and then it fades, and then it comes back,” he says. The happy and the sad can happen at the same time. When asked about the accident with the car, Cox downplays its significance; when asked about the breezy aura that Frontier emits, he shrugs it off matter-of-factly: “We recorded in the springtime.”\nThe trope of a group following an alienating record with a (relatively) calming one is a part of rock’n’roll mythos; in that sense, Deerhunter’s latest shift isn’t unique. What is surprising, though, is the potency of Fading Frontier — the band may have tamed their sound, but their powers haven’t dulled a bit. In fact, they’ve streamlined a lot of the threads that have made them so fascinating for so long. Cox’s lyrics remain cryptic: resistant to straightforward reading, romantic but not about romance, an enticing blend of menace and sensitivity. His fixation with malt-shop balladry continues to pay off with “Take Care,” the LP’s centerpiece and a serious contender for the single most gorgeous song in the Deerhunter oeuvre. The partnership between Cox and Pundt is distilled into the somehow first-ever duet between the two on the almost radio-ready single “Breaker.” And most fulfilling is the fact that the band’s seventh album is their gentlest and, classically speaking, their prettiest-sounding to date.\nSay whatever you’d like about the songwriting, but Cox insists, “If you say it just doesn’t sound good, well, then I’d say you don’t know anything about capturing sound.” And he wouldn’t be out of line; the production on Frontier — handled by Deerhunter and collaborator Ben H. Allen, who also helmed Halcyon Digest — is the crispest the band has ever had. “Breaker” in particular, with its oceanic imagery and “sunlit synth pads” (as Cox calls them), typifies the open-skies clarity that’s largely on view.\nBut, as always, there’s a darker lining to Deerhunter’s songs, layers to their craftsmanship. The aforementioned “Take Care” laces its ‘50s-flirting arrangement with foreboding lyrics that reference corpses, loneliness, and a crippled hand waving bye-bye. “Ad Astra,” written and sung by Pundt, also hovers on the record’s nocturnal side and closes by sampling a slice of anthologized Americana .\nAdmittedly, Deerhunter hasn’t been at the center of too many discussions about music in 2015, but what other band has? What’s striking about this most recent full-length — and, really, this moment in Deerhunter’s career — is that it’s the work of a band with tremendous confidence. They may not have arrived at the happy ending that rockcrit groupthink is all too happy to peddle, but they have arrived at a point where they know themselves and their strengths, and they’re operating on their own plateau. Over the last ten or so years, they’ve grown from the sort of outfit that couldn’t be more than a paragraph’s distance from the word “blog” to becoming a modern indie-rock institution.\nDeerhunter have given us a true rarity in 2015: a new legacy band. Even better, they show no indication of being past their prime. This is a quiet coronation for them; they’re the kings of this frontier, whether it’s fading or not. — K.M.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links":
