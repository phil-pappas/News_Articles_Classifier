A year after \" Annabelle \" hit the screens, it is announced that a sequel is in the works with original screenwriter Gary Dauberman penning the script. A spin-off to successful horror film \" The Conjuring \", \"Annabelle\" scored $37.2 million in the first week of release on a budget of just $6.5 million. When \" The Conjuring 2: The Enfield Poltergeist \" was announced last year, the next logical step was to produce an \"Annabelle\" sequel. It is now confirmed that New Line has put the wheels in motion. However, the news is so early that no other attachments have been revealed. TrackingBoard.com reported that \"Annabelle\" director John Leonetti is not returning for the sequel and a search for new director is on. The site also said James Wan would return to produce the film while Dave Neustadter and Walter Hamada oversee for New Line. Part one explores the history of the haunted doll Annabelle who exists locked up in an occult museum in Connecticut-visited only by a priest who blesses her twice a month. The original cast are Annabelle Wallis , Ward Horton and Alfre Woodard . \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Annabelle News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T05:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T10:46:53.389+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
