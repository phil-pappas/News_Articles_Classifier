Thanks to Saint Alphonsus and the High Five Children's Health Collaborative Powered by the Blue Cross of Idaho Foundation for Health, local students are more active at school with GoNoodle, an online suite of interactive physical activity breaks. GoNoodle helps teachers engage and motivate students with 3-5 minute moderate to vigorous exercises they can perform next to their desks, and elementary school students throughout the Treasure Valley are celebrating a milestone of 10 million minutes of physical activity performed in the 2014-15 school year. Research supports that short bursts of movement throughout the day can improve student overall health, behavior, focus and cognition while working to reduce childhood obesity. A recent independent study found that students who played GoNoodle’s Mega Math Marathon over the course of the 2014-15 school year showed a 50% greater improvement in math scores over students who did not play it.\nGoNoodle is currently available to more than 2,900 teachers and 90,000 students in 233 schools across Idaho. In the Boise area alone, more than 360 teachers currently use GoNoodle in their classrooms, generating more than 2.5 million minutes of student physical activity since the last school year.\n“We are delighted to partner with High Five to bring GoNoodle to schools in our region. The results prove we are moving the needle in our fight against childhood obesity locally,\" said Aimee M. Stein, Business Development Specialist at Saint Alphonsus.\n“GoNoodle is a great program to get children active in the classroom. High Five, powered by the Blue Cross of Idaho Foundation is proud to be a partner and help get this amazing resource into classrooms” said Kendra Witt-Doyle, Manager Blue Cross of Idaho Foundation.\nChildhood obesity continues to be a leading health issue affecting children across the country. According to the CDC, only one-quarter of youth meet the current recommendation of at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per day. GoNoodle is helping Southern Idaho students earn those important minutes through entertaining experiences that feature high-energy dance music, fitness routines, virtual field trips and physical challenges.\n\"Regular physical activity is critically important to the healthy development of kids. And, we know healthy kids do better in school,” said Scott McQuigg, CEO and co-founder of GoNoodle. “Together with Saint Alphonsus and Blue Cross of Idaho Foundation for Health, we have kids moving during school like never before.”\nIn celebration of Southern Idaho student achievement of 10 million physical activity minutes documented, GoNoodle, Saint Alphonsus, and Blue Cross of Idaho Foundation for Health will be visiting the students at Horizon Elementary, a school with one of the highest participation rates in the Southern Idaho region. Joining them will be GoNoodle Champ, Zapp Von Doubler (mascot) who will pay a special visit to Christina Fitzner’s 3rd grade class, leading students in a series of their favorite GoNoodle activities. Christina Fitzner and her students have excelled in promoting some of the highest GoNoodle engagement across the entire Southern Idaho area.\nSouthern Idaho area teachers currently have access to over 120 online physical activity breaks. To use GoNoodle, teachers need to have a computer with an Internet connection and a shared screen such as a projector or interactive white board. Southern Idaho area teachers can access GoNoodle for free by signing up at http://www.gonoodle.com .\nAbout GoNoodle\nGoNoodle is an online resource for elementary teachers to improve student engagement and youth health through physical activity breaks.
