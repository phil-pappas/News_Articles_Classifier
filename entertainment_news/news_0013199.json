The Moon is in Sagittarius. Aries (March 21-April 19) \nThis is the classic day for misunderstandings and disappointments. Travel plans might be shelved or delayed. And likewise, your relations with people from other cultures and different countries might disappoint you for some reason. Perhaps you expected too much? Taurus (April 20-May 20) \nThis is not an ideal day to firmly settle matters regarding inheritances and shared property because too many elements of confusion are in the picture. In addition, someone might not be entirely honest with you about what they expect or about what they can deliver. Gemini (May 21-June 20) \nToday you will have to be patient and tolerant with others because it will be easy for you to feel let down by them. However, there’s a good likelihood that your expectations were unrealistic — or worse yet, unexpressed. People cannot read your mind. Cancer (June 21-July 22) \nDoublecheck everything at work today because a lot of confusion will accompany work-related conversation or instructions. In addition to this, people might easily be disappointed with each other because they had higher expectations of something. Leo (July 23-Aug. 22) \nIt’s very easy to go overboard trying to have some fun today. You might eat too much; you might drink too much. Likewise, romantic couples might be disappointed in each other. Meanwhile, parents should be extra vigilant about their kids, especially related to poisons and bad food. Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22) \nFamily discussions could go either way today because things are fuzzy, confusing and nebulous. In one way, you might easily be sympathetic with a family member. However, agree to nothing important. Don’t lend money; don’t make promises. (A bad loan means you not only lose your money, you lose your friend, too.) Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22) \nYou might spend a lot of time daydreaming or woolgathering today. One thing is certain, your imagination will be going full tilt. So if you need to use your imagination, lucky you. But if you need to make grounded, logical, practical decisions — postpone them until tomorrow. Scorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21) \nBe careful with financial transactions today. Count your change and check your bills or invoices. Be careful not to misplace or lose something. Assume nothing if you are doing any kind of negotiations. Postpone important decisions until tomorrow — definitely. Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21) \nYou might feel disappointed in a loved one or someone close to you. You feel let down or betrayed, and certainly misunderstood. But much of this is all the work of fuzzy Neptune — smoke and mirrors. Self-deception as well as deception by others is all too easy today. (Riff from “The Twilight Zone” here.) Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19) \nThis is a poor day to make an educated decision about politics, religion, philosophical matters or anything to do with business with foreign countries because too much confusion is present. Not only confusion, but just wishful thinking. You like hard data. “Just the facts, ma’am.” Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18) \nBe leery of financial deals today because of the Moon Alert above and also because there is a general lack of clarity to everything today. It’s as if you have Vaseline on your lens. It is this confusion that can affect your cash flow, earnings and money decisions. Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20) \nDon’t get sidetracked by authority figures or a partner or friend who is close to you right now. You are sympathetic and kind by nature. But today some kind of misunderstanding or false expectation can only lead to disappointment. Tomorrow is a better day. If Your Birthday Is Today \nActress Caterina Scorsone (1981) shares your birthday today. You have strong morals and you like to walk your talk. You are fair-minded and personally disciplined. People value your opinions and common sense. Go slowly this year. There is something important to learn. The first half of this year will seem slow, but soon your efforts of the past six years will start to show results! Get out into nature this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:32:17.202+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
