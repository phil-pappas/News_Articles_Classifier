In “5:21-The Nine Divine Words from Ephesians That Can Change Your Marriage for Good!” (published by Xlibris) he wanted more people to gain access to its life changing message.\nIn this book, Larson talks about the nine divine words under the New Testament verse of Ephesians 5:21 which is “mutual submission in marriage out of reverence for Christ.” He lets readers eavesdrop on his conversations with couples, see what is going on in their marriage, learn where they are really struggling and where they are beginning to truly care for each other. These stories allow readers to journey with God and discover his heart and intent for marriage.\n“Marriage is universal and unfortunately, more than half of our marriages throughout the world end in divorce,” Larson points out. “This book reveals God’s instruction to every married couple which, when followed, will lead to success.”\n“ 5:21 ” contains the bold, ageless principle that God tucked inside the New Testament that can bring new hope, strength and direction to one’s marriage today. Larson hopes that through this book, readers will embrace the life-changing truth of God’s Word on marriage.\n“5:21”\nBy Rick Larson\nHardcover | 6 x 9in | 98 pages | ISBN 9781503550216\nSoftcover | 6 x 9in | 98 pages | ISBN 9781503540958\nE-Book | 98 pages | ISBN 9781503540941\nAvailable at Amazon and Barnes & Noble\nAbout the Author\nOrdained by the Evangelical Covenant Church of America, Rick Larson speaks to churches and parachurch ministries throughout North America.
