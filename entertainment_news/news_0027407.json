Now that the third installment of \"Bridget Jones\" movie series, \" Bridget Jones's Baby \", is underway, Universal Pictures and Working Title have just announced that the dramedy is slated to arrive in the U.S. on September 16, 2016. As production continues, Zellweger was recently spotted on the set of the movie at the Borough Markets in London, filming two different scenes. In one scene, the actress was seen carrying a Christmas tree while walking down the snowy street. She wore a thick grey cardigan over a blue sweater which covered her fake baby bump. In another scene, Zellweger looked elegant wearing a blue lace dress and a pair of black stockings. Unlike the previous one, in this scene, Zellweger's Bridget Jones was not pregnant. She approached a street vendor and started a conversation with him. \"Bridget Jones's Baby\" marks Zellweger's third time to reprise her role as the title character following 2001's \"Bridget Jones's Diary\" and 2004's \" Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason \". The upcoming movie also stars Colin Firth as Jones' love interest Mark Darcy with Patrick Dempsey taking on a new role in Jones' life. Sharon Maguire, who helmed the first movie, returns to direct the upcoming film with a script she co-wrote with David Nicholls. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Bridget Jones's Baby News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:11:03.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
