The reason? They want to show their annoyance that a diverse range of actors has been used to play jedi, stormtroopers, ewoks, droids and wookies. \nWTF? #BoycottStarWarsVII may be one of the greatest trolling pranks in the history of Twitter. Someone somewhere is laughing very hard. \n— J. J. Robertson (@jamesjrobertson) October 19, 2015 \nThe main chatter on Twitter with people using the hashtag is not calling for the boycott, but the opposite, calling for a boycott of the boycott, if you like. \nPeople are mad crazy that the phrase exists and they are using their 140 characters to call out racism, explain why such a boycott makes no sense, for a whole heap of reasons, and share their general disbelief that some people have such opposing views. As a white American Male I would like to apologize for the stupidity of #BoycottStarWarsVII \n— Mason Wheeler (@wheelermason) October 19, 2015 Ok #BoycottStarWarsVII people; this is going to melt your brain, but you need to know…James Earl Jones voiced Vader & Lando is black. \n— Jeremy Jahns (@JeremyJahns) October 19, 2015 #BoycottStarWarsVII folks,Lemme get this straight:Wookies, Ewoks & Droids are fine but a BLACK PERSON is a problem?Go home.You're Drunk. \n— Audra McDonald (@AudraEqualityMc) October 19, 2015 so #boycottstarwarsvii is a thing because people are upset that a main character is black….….what? pic.twitter.com/dKY0G3KCMh", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T10:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:45:44.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
