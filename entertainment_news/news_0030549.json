The band's vocalist Joe Jonas enlisted the help of his girlfriend Gigi Hadid to direct the visuals. A very literal take on the track, the video features a giant piece of cake placed by the ocean as DNCE introduces their first annual \"International Cake Fight Championships\". A bunch of bikini-clad girls participate in the new sports event while Jonas and his bandmates perform on a nearby stage. The video was debuted on Entertainment Weekly . Jonas told the site how the group came up with the concept, \"We were thinking of ideas and turned around and said, 'Why not put a massive cake on the beach?' It came together really quickly and were really excited about it because it's just something that I think is wacky and fun.\" Of cleaning up the mess they made during the filming in California's Huntington Beach, DNCE's bassist/keyboardist Cole Whittle revealed, \"We all just ate the cake off the sand. Everyone had cake and had fun.\" Joe also praised Hadid, who co-directed with Black Coffee, when chatting with the outlet. \"She's always had a high creative eye so she came up with concept and we rolled with it,\" he proudly said. \"She was a good boss.\" \"Cake by the Ocean\" will appear on DNCE's debut EP \"Swaay\". They're set to embark on a tour after putting out the project on October 23 through Republic Records. \"We're going to start touring in November,\" Jonas continued. \"And then hopefully next year is just a worldwide world wind of intergalactic touring every single place ever.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T06:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:18:08.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
