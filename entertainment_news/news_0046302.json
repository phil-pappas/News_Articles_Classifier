Mark Davis/Getty Images for The Santa Barbara International Film Festival\n“Ronald Reagan? The actor?” 1955 Doc Brown derisively snorts in the first “Back to the Future” movie when Marty McFly, trying to convince the skeptical inventor that he’s come from 1985, tells him who’s president.\n“Christopher Lloyd? The TV actor?” we all probably thought before the movie came out, when most people thought of Lloyd, if at all, as crazy Reverend Jim from the sitcom “Taxi.” He instantly became an indelible pop culture icon, though, as the frantic but brilliant time machine maker Dr. Emmett Brown in the BTTF trilogy and numerous spinoffs in other media.\nLloyd, who turns 77 Thursday — one day after Doc and Marty famously landed in “Back to the Future Part II’s,” well, future — discussed the most beloved of his hundreds of roles shortly before the Oct. 21, 2015 commemoration.\nQ: IMDB lists some 205 acting credits for you, and it’s not exaggerating too much to say that 1/10th of those are as Doc. Is he your favorite?\nA: He’s certainly one of my favorites; whatever I’m working on is my favorite at that moment. But he’s certainly the most significant character I’ve played. I have no regrets. I love the character. I love the scripts. I love playing the part whenever an opportunity comes up to do it again.\nQ: What is it you like about Doc?\nA: He has such an imagination and energy. He’s constantly inventing. The time machine was his real stroke of genius, but he’s continuously thinking up new things. And he loves it. He loves discovery and coming up with new ways of doing things. And he’s passionate about it; I love that energy and excitement that he has.\nDoc himself is a very positive person. He’s always in crisis, he’s always worried that he’ll do something that might disrupt the space/time continuum, which would be a calamity for the entire universe. It weighs on his soul. So he constantly has to be one step ahead of himself — and he has a lot of fun doing it even though he gets himself in some nerve-wracking situations.\nQ: “Part II” was noteworthy for how you and Michael J. Fox had to redo scenes from the first movie and play multiple versions of your characters within the same frame. What was that like?\nA: The first night of shooting that sequel, I had to replay that scene from the first film when I come down on the cable from the clock tower to the street and struggle to get everything together. Marty is driving down and hopefully it all times out with the bolt of lightning and I jump around yelling with joy that it all worked. So that was the first shot of “Part II.” I was so worried that I would be able to reach the same levels for that that I had at the end of the first film a few years before.\nAdvertisement\nAlso, that same night, they shot the scene where there are two Doc Browns. One of them is up on a ladder doing something with wires and another Doc’s down below, handing me a wrench. It had to be shot so that we never made eye contact, otherwise there’d be a cosmic calamity. It was tricky; we shot one side and then I made some changes with makeup and clothing and we did the other side. I needed to get the conversation between the two of us in sync and all that ... and that was the first night back.\nQ: What do you think accounts for BTTF’s enduring appeal?\nA: Everybody imagines at some point — I know I have, even before “Back to the Future” — that it’d be so great to go to some moment in the past or some moment in the future and see what things are like. The films really exploit that notion. People love that and relate to all of Marty’s concerns. And the relationship between Marty and Doc Brown , who is kind of a mentor for Marty, is such a great one.\nMany people growing up have some adult in their lives who opens up the world to them. And then, of course, they’re very well-executed movies.\nAbout the Author Reach the author at bob.strauss@dailynews.com or follow Bob on Twitter: @bscritic .\nFull bio and more articles by Bob Strauss Back to top", "external_links": ["http://mn1-laweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20151020/NEWS/151029967/EP/1/1/EP-151029967.jpg&maxh=400&maxw=667", "http://twitter.com/bscritic", "http://mn1-laweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/persbilde?Avis=LA&ID=22", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:33:28.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
