Heard of her? \nShe plays Alex Parrish, an FBI agent framed for a crime she allegedly didn't commit, on the new show \"Quantico.\" Before this role though, Chopra has been a one-woman Bollywood blockbuster.

She went to high school here, but honestly, it could have gone better . \n\"Well, I had some major racist issues when I was in school. ... There was this one girl who hated me. Her name was Jeanine something. It's because of you I became this way, Jeanine. I should find you on Facebook,\" Chopra said. \nChopra went on to win Miss World in 2000, representing India, and she later became a household name in her home country. She's acquired more than 31 million followers across social media platforms, and it looks like she's well on her way to winning us over as well. \n>>Read more trending stories \nTwo years ago, Chopra started dabbling in the American entertainment industry.
