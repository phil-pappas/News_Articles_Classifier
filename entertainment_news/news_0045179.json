The Sculpture by the Sea exhibition includes 107 works by Australian and international artists. The sculptures will be displayed on Sydney's beaches and coastal walks until Nov. 8. German sculptor Jorg Plickat won the exhibition's major prize and 60,000 Australian dollars ($43,250) for \"Divided Planet,\" a rusted steel structure he described as a fragmented sphere reflecting the world's divisions. Plickat said the start of a millennium brought hope that people would solve the planet's problems but instead we see more division. \"So it is artists' demand to the politicians to give better answers to what our planet needs,\" he said.
