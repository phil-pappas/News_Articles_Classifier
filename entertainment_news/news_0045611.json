And then as soon as she said that, multiple shots were fired. And when she turned and she looked at the classroom, the look on her face was horrifying, and that's when I knew something was wrong,\" the student said. \"When she looked at us, she said, 'We have to get out - now.\"'\nLaw enforcement quickly arrived at the scene. Just 12 minutes after the initial 911 call, the suspected gunman was dead.\n29 Photos Umpqua Community College shooting A deadly shooting took place on an Oregon community college campus October 1, 2015\n\"We do know that we have at least two heroic officers who responded into the building within minutes and exchanged gunfire with the suspect,\" said Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin.\nHundreds of people attended a candlelight vigil in Roseburg late Thursday.\n\"It's amazing, the turnout.
