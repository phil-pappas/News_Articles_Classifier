REGIS FALLS, N.Y. , Oct. 15, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- What would Sara do when she finally leaves the home she called home for 25 years and returns to the estate where the past Sara Sommers haunts? Author Muriel DeBuque continues Sara's family saga in the new book, Return to Gooseneck .\nBefore Sara leaves the place she called home for the past 25 years, she questions herself: What happened to her life? What made her children leave her and their home? What evil lurks in this house? When she finally says goodbye to her friends and her home, she locks the door and drives away. She faces a few scares along the way and stops over at Andy's apartment in Florida for a couple of days before heading for Gooseneck.\nWhen she reaches their family's grand estate, she was surprised, shocked – or rather horrified – to see what was happening in their family home. Her Uncle Joe and stepfather looked sick; the house looked sick; and everything seems to be falling apart. She wonders though if the past Sara Sommers – or her otherworldly presence in this estate – is up to her old tricks again. Calling her brother to come home, they help to make their family estate livable again.\nAs Sara gets re-acquainted with Nathan McCabe , the old sparks rekindle and they may have a chance at love this time around. Will there ever be love in the estate again? Will her family be whole again? Will she find home in this estate again? Readers will find out in Return to Gooseneck .\nThis book is available online and can be purchased at www.amazon.com and www.barnesandnoble.com .\nAbout the Author\nMuriel DeBuque has been married to her husband, Loren, for the past 59 years.
