I am very close to him and I know how fair he is with his dealings.

He also sang “Po Po” featuring Salman, Sanjay Dutt, Ajay Devgn and Sonakshi Sinha from “Son Of Sardar”.”I joined showbiz with my 1997 song ‘Hai dhuan hai dhuan’ and the number made me an overnight star. The Indie-pop song made me travel the whole world and I gained name, fame and popularity after that,” he said. \nThis is not the first time Vikas is participating on a reality show. The actor, who did a small role in Salman-starrer “Jai Ho”, was a part of “Star Ya Rockstar” and “Fear Factor India”.Asked what excites him more between reality show and fiction, Vikas said, “I would say both have their own process. One is completely based on a script and the other one is real. If you are versatile, you can sustain in any medium.”\"Bigg Boss Nau”, which sees Salman returning as the host for the sixth time, has 14 celebrity contestants holed up in a house for three months with multiple cameras watching their every move. \n  11:20 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:37:56.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
