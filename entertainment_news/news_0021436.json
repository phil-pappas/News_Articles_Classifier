Every imaginable breed was paraded one by one to preen before judges in the hopes of a Best in Show award.\nThere were doggy dinosaurs, an alligator and a fisherman. There also were characters from \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"The Flintstones\" and a dog dressed as Pope Francis.\nManhattan resident Robert Krzywicki (kihz-WIHK'-ee) says his dachshund, Daisy Mae, was treated \"like a movie star.\"\nBut he says he suspects his dog and many others were freaked out and a little humiliated by their costumes.\n News Nation/World Religion Associated Press", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-24T22:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:10:47.774+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
