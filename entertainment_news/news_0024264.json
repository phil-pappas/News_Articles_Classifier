Of the many new movies hitting theaters this weekend, two scary new offerings are doing well in their opening days. \nAs we get into the thick of the weekend, Goosebumps , the horror comedy based on the books of R.L. Stine and starring Jack Black, looks like it's going to come out on top. The movie took in $7 million on Friday and is on track to earn somewhere in the low $20 million range by the end of the weekend. \nCrimson Peak , the gothic thriller from Guillermo del Toro, had an even stronger Friday than Goosebumps did, taking in about $9 million. Observers think that the more family-oriented Goosebumps will hold up better through Saturday and Sunday, though, and Crimson Peak will likely earn around $20 million by the end of the weekend. \nBoth of these films will have to finish strong to hold off The Martian , which is still performing well and could take the top spot for a third week in a row. \nBridge of Spies , the Tom Hanks/Steven Spielberg espionage drama, almost certainly won't be a contender for first place. It's on a pace to earn $15 million or so for the weekend. Steve Jobs , the biopic from director Danny Boyle, won't be anywhere near the top; although it performed well last week in front of limited audiences in New York and Los Angeles, it's not sparking much interest nationwide and will probably earn about $2 or $3 million for the weekend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T19:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T23:07:50.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
