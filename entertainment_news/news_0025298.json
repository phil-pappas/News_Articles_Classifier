It will demonstrate Gershowitz’s attentiveness to the details of everyday life as seen through windows of cars, trains, airplanes and buildings. Some of the photos depict views seen from inside looking out, while others were shot from outside looking in. \n“These photos show the ordinary things that everyone sees while they are driving, riding or walking,” Gershowitz says, of the show that runs through Sunday, Dec. 6. “Every photograph records something behind glass, inside or outside a window, looking out or in. I hope that the viewer will recognize them as scenes they have seen themselves, and then find something of themselves in the photos, too.” \nThe second part of the show, titled “Remember Spring?” will debut on Dec. 7. The photos are a collection of the simple beauty of flowers that Gershowitz has photographed during her travels. \n“I thought it would be good in December to show flashes of color,” Gershowitz says, of the exhibit that runs through Thursday, Jan. 7. \nGershowitz never uses computer programs to change the content of her photos, which are all shot in natural light. “The photos all demonstrate a partnership between me and the camera,” she says, in a news release on the two-part exhibit. \nAn informational session will be held during both stages of the show where Gershowitz will discuss her work and answer questions. Each session will be free and open to the public, as is the photo exhibit. \nGershowitz has been a professional photographer for two decades, including many years documenting local theater. Her work appeared in theater bills, posters and in actors’ portfolios, as well as in The News-Times. She has exhibited at The Stanley L. Richter Association for the Arts , Danbury City Hall and previously at the Danbury Library. \nIn addition to her art, Gershowitz, who formerly sat on the Danbury Board of Education , is still active regionally and nationally as an advocate for health care and education. \nDanbury Public Library, 170 Main St., Danbury.
