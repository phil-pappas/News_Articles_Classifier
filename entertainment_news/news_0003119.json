At the time, that seemed like a fine idea, until I saw the payroll on the Internet and realized every man I was working with definitely didn't worry about being ‘difficult' or ‘spoiled.'' \nWhile talking about the massive difference of the wages between male and female actors, she also said how she didn't take any step towards feminism or this issue earlier as she was worried about her reputation. \nThe thought of not coming across as a spoiled actress provoked her more when she got to know that Angelina Jolie was referred to as 'spoiled' by a producer. \nShe further added, \"Are we socially conditioned to behave this way? We've only been able to vote for what, 90 years? I'm seriously asking - my phone is on the counter and I'm on the couch, so a calculator is obviously out of the question. Could there still be a lingering habit of trying to express our opinions in a certain way that doesn't 'offend' or 'scare' men?\" \nJennifer didn't fail to mention that one of the reasons behind a certain kind of treatment towards her could be the age. She said being the most paid youngest actress in the world, standing up to what she wants or even questioning about her pay seemed very difficult and impossible at times. \nSounding agitated she said,\" I'm over trying to find the \"adorable\" way to state my opinion and still be likable! Fuck that. I don't think I've ever worked for a man in charge who spent time contemplating what angle he should use to have his voice heard. It's just heard. \" \nIt isn't just Jennifer Lawrence who expressed her anger and grief regarding the issue, but also many other actresses, which include, Emma Watson, Meryl Steep, Patricia Arquette, and Dunham. \nThe Hangover actor Bradley Cooper responded to Jennifer's essay saying, \"One thing I could say is that's interesting because if you think that you only deserve a certain amount and that's not correct, it's about changing that mindset and sticking up for yourself the way that Sienna did. So that's a great thing.\" while during his upcoming movie's promotions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T08:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T09:19:56.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
