The couple is also charged with the beating of their 17-year old son, Christopher, who has just been released from hospital. Mike Groll/AP The charges have drawn attention to the Word of Life church in New Hartford, N.Y. Former members of the church where two teens were viciously beaten paint a picture of a once vibrant and joyous house of worship that had declined into a place of fear and intimidation under new leadership. Previous Next Enlarge NEW HARTFORD â€” A 17-year-old boy who was brutally beaten inside a church alongside his older brother was released from the hospital and planned to testify at a hearing against at least one of his attackers, authorities said Monday.\nChristopher Leonard and his 19-year-old brother, Lucas, were pummeled with fists and kicked Oct. 11 by their parents, a sister and other members of their small and secretive church to get them to confess their sins and seek forgiveness, authorities allege.\nLucas Leonard died in the beating, but Christopher was discharged from the hospital over the weekend and is now under the supervision of Oneida County Child Protective Services, New Hartford police said.\nHe is expected to testify against his 33-year-old sister, Sarah Ferguson, at a preliminary hearing scheduled for Wednesday. She is charged with assault and remains in custody.\nThe victims' parents, Bruce and Deborah Leonard, face the most serious charge, manslaughter, and were being held on $100,000 bail.\nAP Sarah Ferguson, a member of the Word of Life Church, has been charged with assault for beating 19-year-old Lucas Leonard in the church. Enlarge AP Joseph Irwin has been hit with the same charge. Enlarge Sarah Ferguson (left) and Joseph Irwin (right), members of the Word of Life Church, have been charged with assault for the beatings.\nThree other church members are also charged with assault. They are Joseph Irwin, 26, David Morey, 26, and Morey's 54-year-old mother, Linda Morey.\nAll six have pleaded not guilty.\nAn attorney for the victims' mother has said she was too timid to stop the beating. A lawyer for the father has said the incident stemmed from a family meeting that had nothing to do with the church.\nDuring an Oct. 16 hearing in New Hartford Town Court, Oneida County Assistant District Attorney Dawn Lupi said Christopher Leonard's testimony would be integral against those charged with assaulting him and asked that scheduled court hearings be postponed until his release from the hospital.\nAP Linda Morey has been charged with assault in the incident.

All four have pleaded not guilty.\nPolice said Irwin will be in court Wednesday, but the DA believes the judge will probably give him a new date. Both Irwin and the Moreys are free on bail.\nThe arrests in New Hartford, a town of 22,000 people, have thrown a spotlight on the regimented and insular Word of Life Christian Church that operated from a red-brick former school that also served as a communal home for several members.\nThe Leonards' home in the nearby town of Clayville, meanwhile, was described as foul-smelling and filled with garbage by an animal advocate who rescued four seemingly neglected dogs and other animals several days after the couple's arrest.\nKimberly Strong, founder of Lainey's Army, an animal advocacy group based in central New York, said the home had four neglected dogs, three birds and several cats in and around their house. All the animals are now in foster care, she said.\nRelated Stories Church responds to report that Carrey's ex was Scientologist Deadbeat dad accused of murdering his transgender son China executes two cult members for slaying at McDonald's", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:25:15.786+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
