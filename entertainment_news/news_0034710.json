The first single, \"Looking Up,\" is out on Friday. \n\"Wonderful Crazy Night\" is co-produced by John and T Bone Burnett, who worked on the piano-playing star's rootsy, well-received 2013 release \"The Diving Board.\" \nLyrics are by Bernie Taupin, John's songwriting partner of almost five decades. \nJohn, 68, is one of Britain's most enduringly successful musicians, and a campaigner for gay rights around the world. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1998 for his contributions to pop music and to the fight against AIDS.
