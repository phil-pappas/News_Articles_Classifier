(KTHV) --The Little Rock Film Festival started nine years ago and has quickly developed a reputation as a destination among filmmakers. Unfortunately, time and money have become its' biggest obstacle and organizers have decided to end the festival's run. \nMatt DeCample, Media Director for the Little Rock Film Festival says:\"It's driven very heavily by volunteer loads and very dedicated people who put all of their passion into it. Unfortunately, there hasn't been as much money into it as they would like to see and they feel they need to continue. So it's always been a \"hey, can we all team together and make this happen\" and looking at the year ahead and what they're facing in 2016, they felt like if we can't do it big and do it right then we're just not going to do it next year. So they're it putting aside for now and we'll see what the future holds.\" \nWhile there is no timeline for the festival's return, the option is always there if the opportunity comes along. In the meantime, there are several other festivals in Arkansas to showcase filmmaking talent, including this weekend's hot springs documentary film festival. \nDuring its' run, the festival has featured a heavy focus on films about life in the south several of which have been screened at major festivals such as the Sundance Film Festival and many of the documentaries on the program have been nominated for academy awards.
