The play list for the nights draw on house, techno, UK Garage, drum and bass, plus a considerable dose of disco. \nFrom the outset you’re involved, with wild games and entertainment while you queue. Once inside, there are ball pits, bouncy castles, space hoppers, inflatables, face painters, magicians, caricature artists, jungle anthem pass the parcel and retro video games. \nEnjoy a dedicated LEGO area, a host of inflatable animals, a photo booth, giant Jenga and other retro games and bubble wrap popping! \nAll of this is soundtracked by top international DJs from the likes of Rinse FM, i-D Magazine and Fabric. \nExpect a no expenses spared, sensory-stimulating experience with rib-rattling sound, mesmeric lights and lasers on Saturday December 12. Share article \nOrganisers launched the underground party series in a bid to regress back to a sillier, more youthful time. \nTickets are available at skiddle.com .
