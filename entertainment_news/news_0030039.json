The official and only provider of water transportation to the show and between its venues, Water Taxi offers a vastly more affordable, convenient, and pleasant way to access the popular and crowded event.\nWater Taxi will feature northern, southern and New River routes, each focused exclusively on the event with limited stops and 11 boats running the duration of the show which drop off and pick up every 10-15 minutes. The service will run daily from one hour before the show to two hours following its conclusion. Pick-up locations, including the Gallery One Double Tree Hotel, Riverside Hotel and Fort Lauderdale Convention Center, have been selected to minimize boat show traffic, and each provides ample parking options at very low rates.\nAll-day Water Taxi wristbands will be just $10 during the boat show, compared to on-site parking which can cost upwards of $40 per day. A five-day Water Taxi wristband can also be purchased in advance for only $40 by contacting the Water Taxi office.\n“In addition to being the easiest, cheapest and most efficient way to access the International Boat Show, the Water Taxi also provides a fun and enhanced event experience,” said Mike McGurl, co-owner of Water Taxi. “Instead of sitting in traffic, visitors can see the mega yachts up close right from the water and pass by the beautiful homes on Millionaires’ Row with narration from the knowledgeable and friendly Water Taxi crew.”\nFor more information on the Boat Show routes, parking and more, please visit: http://watertaxi.com/fort-lauderdale-boat-show/ or call 954-466-7766.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/fort-lauderdale-boat-show/water-taxi/prweb13031126.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://watertaxi.com/", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/fort-lauderdale-boat-show/water-taxi/prweb13031126.htm", "http://watertaxi.com/fort-lauderdale-boat-show/"], "published": "2015-10-20T18:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:30:57.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
