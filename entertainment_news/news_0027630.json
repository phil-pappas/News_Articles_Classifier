AP PHOTOS: Promoting James Bond from 'Dr. No' to 'Spectre' File - In this Monday, June 29, 1987 file photo, Princess Diana meets Timothy Dalton, who succeeded Roger Moore as James Bond at the charity premiere of \"The Living Daylights\" at London's Odeon Cinema. The Welshman, who was a trained Shakespearean actor, played Bond twice. His interpretation of Bond was far grittier than Moore's. After his second outing as Bond, 1989's \"License To Kill,\" legal issues meant Bond wouldn't return again until 1995's \"Goldeneye\", when Pierce Brosnan took the role of 007. The upcoming new Bond film \"Spectre\" starring Daniel Craig has its World Premiere on Monday Oct. 26, 2015, in London.
