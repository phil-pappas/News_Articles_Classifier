The children will visit multiple Orlando attractions, including SeaWorld, Disney World, and Universal Studios--which will, of course, include a visit to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter.\n\"I read about what Dreamflight was and how amazing it was going to be for these kids that I jumped at the chance to be here,\" Lewis said in a video interview. \"It's been the most amazing day, it's been a pleasure.\"\nThe children were personally chosen by doctors and medical experts due to the struggles with serious illness, disability, and trauma and were accompanied by about 100 doctors, nurses, and physiotherapists.\n\"Some of these kids are so buzzing, and it just warms your heart so much to see their faces,\" Lewis said.\nMore than 5,000 children have enjoyed Dreamflight trips since it was started in 1987.", "external_links": ["http://www.snitchseeker.com/harry-potter-news/matthew-lewis-aids-200-children-going-to-orlando-theme-parks-for-dreamflight-charity-102189/"], "published": "2015-10-22T00:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:56:42.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
