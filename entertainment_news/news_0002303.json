Junaid Mohd who smashed a dozen tubes on their head in the Tazia procession said, \"If everybody is going to use LED bulbs in the future, then how we will get defunct tube lights next year.\"\nAccording to Bharat Bhushan, project officer of Uttar Pradesh New and Renewable Energy Development Agency, \"Government has been distributing LED bulbs at subsidized rate under Domestic Efficient Lighting Programme. Till now in UP, government has sold up to 32.9 lakh LED bulbs.\" Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-24T23:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:03:10.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
