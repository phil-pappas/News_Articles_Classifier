According to that arbiter of modernist cultural sensibilities, New York's Museum of Modern Art:   \"It redefined modern warfare in the latter half of the 20th century, facilitated mass killing at a scale and rapidity unmatched by any other weapon.\" It's also a weapon of mass consumption. It's estimated that 75-100 million of Mikhail Kalashnikov's assault rifles are currently in circulation worldwide.\nSo why has a museum that has assiduously collected everything from the @ symbol to the Post-It note ignored the AK-47 and a rack of other killer classics? In a country as gun crazy as the United States, this sounds unpatriotic. Simple: it's against museum policy.\n\"When I got to MoMA 21 years ago I thought of adding the Beretta to the collection,\" recalls Paola Antonelli, MoMA's senior curator of architecture and design. \"I was told, 'No, no, no, it's the Museum of Modern Art'. It's founded on the idea of morality. It comes from the Bauhausian idea that architecture and design – together with all the other arts – come together to improve the world. If you collect a gun you're almost endorsing the use of the gun.\"\nFemale genital mutilation poster by Amnesty International. \nThis \"holstering\" policy excludes everything from Philippe Starck's fetishistic Gun lamps (\"Appalling\" says Antonelli) to the amoral world of the video game Grand Theft Auto (which, despite serious misgivings, Antonelli considers a \"masterpiece\").\nAdvertisement Admirable collecting philosophy aside, blind faith won't change human destructive tendencies. Antonelli found another method to make the museum relevant. Together with Jamer Hunt of the Parsons New School for Design, Antonelli co-curated Design and Violence, a website under the MoMA brand. Here debates take aim at subjects as wide ranging as Cody Wilson's open-source 3D-printed Liberator handgun to the death penalty, female genital mutilation and an 18-page comic explaining Australia's anti-people-smuggling policy Operation Sovereign Borders.\n\"It was really prompted by a desire to make the museum count in people's everyday lives,\" says the distinguished curator, who will deliver a talk on design and violence at the NGV tomorrow. \"We want to get people thinking about design.\"\nA shooting range target. \nThis \"curatorial experiment\" is a call to arms for designers also. \"I believe in systemic revolutions – revolutions from within,\" says Antonelli. \"We each have a role to play. As curator I can start a chain reaction by instilling doubt in some designers about what they are doing and say, 'I'm not going to make it'.\n\"Design has an ambiguous relationship with violence,\" Antonelli says. \"It's never just good or evil. It's the ambiguity and ambivalence in between that can be most educational.\"\nFor instance, can we ever design an ethical way to kill people and animals? To Antonelli's surprise more heated online debate arose over the design of abattoirs than it did over lethal injection.\nA key strength to the website is the people it has fighting in each corner. PETA founder Ingrid Newkirk defends the design of Temple Grandin's labyrinthine slaughterhouses. The Serpentine design stops the animals panicking and injuring themselves. Meanwhile, Ricky Jackson, who spent 39 years in prison and two years on death row before being exonerated, writes powerfully about the purported humanity of lethal injection: \"We tend to associate medicine with feelings of wellness, healing, and of something wrong being made right. However, this is exactly why the pharmaceutical aspect was brought into play: to lend an atmosphere of legitimacy to an otherwise gruesome process, and to placate whatever sensibilities we may have about executions in general.\"\nJust as products undergo research and development, Design and Violence forms part of MoMA's R&D. \"Museums are places where citizens can test ideas, come and have real frank conversations about important matters,\" says Antonelli. \"They are places where art and design can become the fulcrum of a new way of thinking.\"\nFor Antonelli the initiative uses violence to discuss design, and design to open up debates about violence.\n\"We cannot think that objects are intrinsically benign,\" says Antonelli. \"We have to be critical about the world around us.\"\nPaola Antonelli, Design and Violence, NGV International, St Kilda Road, October 4, 5pm-6pm; free entry, limited seating; ngv.vic.gov.au ; designandviolence.moma.org", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T16:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:25:30.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
