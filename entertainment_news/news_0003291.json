Photo: Tony Moore \nRocKwiz can be the best of times, it can be the worst of times.\nIt is the worst of times for contestants when you forget your Rolling Stones riffs and get Satisfaction mixed up with Jumping Jack Flash.  Punishment? You have to strut like Jagger in front of a packed, laughing house at QPAC.\nIt is the best of times when you hear Russell Morris sing a version of his hit Sweet Sweet Love that is so good the woman in the seat next to you is crying tears of joy.\nThen Vika Bull sang AC/DC's Back in Black . Woo, yeah. Honestly, both were breathtaking. Vika and Linda Bull are simply outstanding.\nAdvertisement At a RocKwiz gig - rock and roll facts are thrown to two teams of contestants drawn from the crowd and mixed and stored with a live band - the Rockwiz Orchestra - to die for.\nIf you know your Australian rock and roll, you are among friends. Friends who know the riff to The Saints Know Your Product as much as the Easybeat's She So Fine , AC/DC's Back in Black or Brian Cadd's  Ginger Man .\nThrow in some damn good jokes from hosts Brian Nankervis and Julia Zemiro like this one. Question: Russell Morris is opening a new Chinese shop honouring Mao Tse Tung called \"Ooo Mao Mao Mao Mao\" - (think of The Real Thing 's chorus)?.\nAnswer:  I'm not telling.\nSaturday night's show - there is another in Toowoomba - had it all,  bar a famous Queenslander to sing their contribution to Australian rock and roll hall of fame.\nIt's not a crime; Billy Thorpe - nominated in 1991 is no longer with us, Barry Gibb (1997) - the remaining Bee Gee was in south-east Queensland last month to revisit Redcliffe, but unavailable; and there was no-one - not surprisingly - from The Saints (2001).\nPowderfinger, Regurgitator or the Go Betweens aren't yet in ARIA's Hall of Fame.\nThe show was framed around the Australian bands and singer-songwriters that delivered the songs that have been punched out in Australian venues for 50 years.\nThe guests delivered the goods and then some.\nAdalita (Magic Dirt) punched out Rose Tattoo's Rock and Roll Outlaw , Ella Hooper (Killing Heidi) crooned Australian Crawl's Reckless with the moon reflecting on the waves on the screen behind her, and You Am I's\nDavy Lane sang a sweet sweet version of the Masters Apprentices' It's Because I Love You .\nIt begins when they choose the RocKwiz panel contestants after the crowd hunts for the 13 wild cards for contestant hidden under their seats.\nIt's crazy, pacy, full of jokes and shows why Brian Nankervis and Julia Zemiro would be Logies' hosts with a real difference. Now there's a viral campaign to consider.\nIt closed with Brian Cadd and Russell Morris singing Brian's Little Ray of Sunshine with everyone singing the chorus \"don't it make it feel that it's all worthwhile.\"\nAnd - ladies and gentleman - it was.\nRocKwiz plays Toowoomba's Empire Theatre, Sunday October 25, 8pm, then to other States.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T04:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T14:21:26.428+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
