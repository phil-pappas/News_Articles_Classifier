By Nathan Dominitz Today could be a turning point for the college football teams of primary importance to our area.\nAnd it could be a stomach-turning afternoon for their fans.\nThe Georgia Bulldogs may not call it a must-win game, but beating host Tennessee is crucial if the Athens contingent wants to accomplish any of its goals this season.\nThe Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets certainly don’t want to stomach a fourth-straight loss, which is what oddsmakers expect to happen by making host Clemson a touchdown-plus favorite.\nThe Savannah State Tigers, on the other hand, see today as an opportunity to build a two-game winning streak. A modest goal, but the last time that happened was the stretch from Sept. 6-13, 2008. The Tigers vanquished Livingstone and Winston Salem State en route to a 5-7 campaign. Remember the good ol’ days?\nThey won only two games in 2009, one time in each of the 2010, ’11, ’12 and ’13 seasons, and then were winless in 2014 (0-12) and through the first three games this year. A 24-game losing skid was snapped with the 37-27 victory over Florida A&M (0-5) last Saturday in SSU’s home opener at T.A. Wright Stadium. There was jubilation and relief.\nWhich got me to thinking: Which is more fatiguing for the truly invested fan, rooting for good teams with high, perhaps unrealistic expectations, only to have your heart broken, or slogging through season after season when mediocrity would be an improvement, hoping for that breakthrough victory to lift the program?\nDo you appreciate what you have, a glass-half-full perspective, or do you double-over in frustration at yet another disappointing outcome in the big game? Georgia fans might ask if the glass is even the right size after Alabama kicked the Bulldogs up and down the field last week 38-10.\nThrow out that the Crimson Tide were labeled the underdog. Yes, Georgia was unbeaten, at home and ranked No. 8 by The Associated Press, while Alabama was 3-1, on the road and ranked 13th. Rankings not only change weekly, but teams are moving up and down polls faster than Ben Carson.\nGeorgia was No. 9 in the preseason poll, got as high as No. 7 and sank to No. 19 this week. Alabama was No. 3 before the season opened and fell with a loss to Mississippi. The Rebels then soared to No. 3 before losing and dropping to No. 11.\nYup, rankings are basically not worth worrying about.\nThe better indicator was whom Georgia had beaten. Louisiana Monroe, Vanderbilt, Southern and even South Carolina aren’t scaring anybody this season. Alabama also played ULM (gluttons for punishment) as well as Wisconsin, Middle Tennessee and Ole Miss — a decidedly tougher slate.\nAnd oh yeah, they’re the Crimson Tide. As long as Nick Saban wears crimson and white, and blue-chip recruits flock to Tuscaloosa for more than barbeque, Alabama is the bar by which other SEC squads measure themselves. There’s no shame in losing to these guys, but the Bulldogs can’t let it puncture their confidence and play flat against the Volunteers.\nHighs and lows\nGeorgia Tech was preseason No. 16, rose as high as 14, fell to 20 and then dive-bombed out of the AP poll during a run of defeats to pretty good to not bad outfits Notre Dame, Duke and North Carolina.\nMany of us were fooled when Tech absolutely crushed Alcorn State 69-6 and Tulane 65-10, but a clearer view is the Jackets (2-3) have a ways to go to compete with top-25 teams. Unless they beat No. 6 Clemson (4-0) — then all is forgotten and there’s a chance to make something of this season.\nThe road to respectability for Savannah State is not paved with the likes of Clemson or Tennessee. The Tigers visit Morgan State (2-2) today in Baltimore in a Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference tilt.\nAfter that, North Carolina Central comes to Savannah for homecoming. N.C. Central (1-3, 0-1) handed SSU a 42-14 defeat in 2014, but also fell to the Tigers in 2011 and 2010 — too long ago to motivate current players yet recent enough for optimistic fans.\nSSU’s other remaining opponents — Howard (0-5), Norfolk State (2-3), Hampton (2-3) and South Carolina State (2-3) — haven’t gotten off to stellar starts.\nWin enough of those games, and SSU could make an impact in the MEAC standings. The glass would be at least half full of a celebratory beverage.\nNathan Dominitz is a sports reporter for the Savannah Morning News. Contact him at 912-652-0350 or nathan.dominitz@savannahnow.com .
