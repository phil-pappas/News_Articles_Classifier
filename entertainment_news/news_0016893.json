(Photo by John Salangsang/Invision/AP) Lady Gaga said she felt alive and 'like herself' on 'AHS' Associated Press | 0 comments \nLOS ANGELES (AP) — Appearing in the new season of \"American Horror Story\" was a life boost for Lady Gaga. \nThe singer raved about her experience on \"American Horror Story: Hotel\" as she arrived for the star-studded premiere of the FX show on Saturday night. \nWith fiancé Taylor Kinney as her date, Lady Gaga said the experience of playing Countess Elizabeth, who runs the Hotel Cortez, made her feel alive. \n\"It's been so fun,\" said Lady Gaga, who arrived fashionably late in a red gown with a thigh-high slit. \n\"Everybody on this cast has been really open and available to me in a very honest way, so I'm able to be myself in a way I feel like I haven't been in a really long time, so they are just making me feel so alive,\" Lady Gaga said. \nShe called the fifth installment of the Emmy-winning show a masterpiece and praised executive producer and co-creator Ryan Murphy. \n\"I'm just really happy to be a part of it. I like being a part of someone else's vision it's really exhilarating,\" she added. \nLady Gaga endeared herself to the cast. Matt Bomer said some of her fellow actors called her by her given first name (her real name is Stefani Germanotta). \n\"it's sort of takes the mythos and all the preconceptions of Lady Gaga out of the equation so we can just relate to each other like human beings and actors in a scene,\" explained Bomer. \"She's so approachable that she totally just was there for us ... at by the time the cameras were rolling and we were in a scene together, we weren't thinking about the fact that you were doing a scene with Lady Gaga.\" \nDenis O'Hare spilled juicy details about the super exclusive bash Lady Gaga threw for the cast, which includes regulars like Angela Bassett, Sarah Paulson, and Kathy Bates. \n\"She had a pool; she dyed it blood red,\" said O'Hare. \"She had bathing suits for all of us. I jumped right in. I wore a woman's bathing suit at one point. She had a massive amount of food for us.\" \nBeing Lady Gaga, there was also some sauciness involved. \n\"She had a half-naked bartender for some of us it was an incredible party and it was just us, so it was comfortable and we all got to know each other,\" he said. \"She got a birthday cake for Angela. I can't describe it. It was an obscene birthday cake, it was shocking actually.\" \nSupermodel Naomi Campbell is among the new additions to the show. Campbell, who also appears on \"Empire,\" said the role came about when Ryan offered her a role over dinner. Up until Saturday night the cast wasn't able to discuss anything about the new season. The British supermodel said keeping hush hush was really easy for her. \n\"It's never been my thing of speaking before something happens,\" she said. \"I kind of find that bad luck.\" \nThe show premieres Wednesday night. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T23:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T06:07:05.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
