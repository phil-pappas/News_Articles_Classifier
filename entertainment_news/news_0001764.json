He is running to regain his seat.\nCastor has defended his decision not to charge Cosby by saying Constand gave a less serious account to police than she described in her 2005 lawsuit.\nShe accuses Cosby of drugging and sexually assaulting her at his home near Philadelphia in January 2004. Cosby has denied it.\nThe current prosecutor has reopened the criminal case.\nThe Legal Intelligencer first reported on the Constand defamation lawsuit.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-26T23:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:57:45.068+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
