Physical dependence on drugs, like benzodiazepines, are a monumental problem in this country. Little is known by healthcare professionals about how to withdraw from these addictive substances. People can become addicted in a short period of time. Trying to come off the drugs, even under a doctor's care, leaves them experiencing physical, mental and emotional symptoms that can be unbearable,” Gordon said. “This book is a true record of an individual who became accidentally addicted to prescription pills, given to her by her physician, and the nightmare that followed trying to withdraw.”\nPublished by New York City-based Page Publishing, Gordon’s work is a probing tale of dependence on prescription medication and dealing with withdrawal.\n“Drug companies are pushing their products on doctors with one purpose in mind: to get rich,” Gordon said. “Physicians want to please their patients who want quick fixes to their problems. This is a dangerous combination,” she said. “Doctors are trained by big pharmaceutical companies, who do not have the interest of sick people at the heart of their work.”\nReaders who wish to experience this chilling work can purchase “The Benzo Monster” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708.\nAbout Page Publishing\nPage Publishing is a traditional New York based full-service publishing house that handles all of the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
