My staff, all the key guys, moved from the city out here.\" \nRELATED: 10 hottest places to eat in New Jersey in October \nJockey Hollow was one of six restaurants on the list of 15 to get a feature in the magazine, though Esquire singled out Shaya, an Israeli restaurant in New Orleans, as the best new restaurant in America. \nFour New York City restaurants also made the cut: Little Park in Noho; the high-end sushi restaurant Shuko ; Santina , the newest hot spot from the buzzy Major Food Group ; and the fowl-focused Mountain Bird in Harlem. \nVicki Hyman may be reached at vhyman@njadvancemedia.com .
