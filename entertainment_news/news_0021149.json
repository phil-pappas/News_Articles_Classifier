Hardly the first time. But let's just say the name stuck when I feared it might not.\nLate last week, the rookie series Rosewood – which stars Morris Chestnut and airs Wednesdays on Fox and CHCH – became the third new U.S. show of the fall to be picked up officially for the entire season. Rosewood was beaten to the punch only by Blindspot (NBC, CTV) and Quantico (ABC, CTV).\nBoth Blindspot and Quantico were far bigger than Rosewood in the buzz department heading into the autumn, however. So I'm reminded yet again that the buzz business and the broadcast business aren't always the same thing.\nI worried about Rosewood largely because I hated the name.\nWell, “hated” probably is too strong. But every season a couple of decent shows get lost in the shuffle, at least in part because their titles are too bland or vague.\nI understand Rosewood is the surname of lead character Dr. Beaumont Rosewood Jr., a.k.a. Rosie, played by Chestnut. But in 2015, to me anyway, Rosewood sounds more like a town in which troubled teens seek love and acceptance, or maybe dodge ghosts, on the CW or MTV or the Disney Channel, you know?\nRosewood, for the record, is not about perky youth. It's about a private pathology consultant, which is a line of work that I didn't even know existed.\nSo Rosie is kind of a “maverick Quincy for hire,” if you're old enough to get that reference. Age aside, Rosie's professional website is AutopsyInc.com, which spells it out for everyone.\nRosie teams up with Detective Annalise Villa, played by Jaina Lee Ortiz, to help the Miami Police Department solve the city’s most puzzling cases. The series also stars Lorraine Toussaint, Gabrielle Dennis, Anna Konkle and Domenick Lombardozzi, and it recently was announced that Taye Diggs will appear in a recurring role, beginning next month.\nOf course, there's a personal situation that's driving Rosie, and since Rosewood has aired only four episodes thus far, I'll issue a SPOILER ALERT here.\nIf you still are reading, I safely can reveal that while Rosie is a slick, confident, brilliant and hunky dude, he also has a serious heart condition that provides a sense of urgency to everything he does.\nSome press material has described Rosewood as a “medical procedural,” but that makes it sound drier than it is. Yes, Rosewood deals with serious issues, but it does so at breakneck speed, no pun intended for Rosie's line of work.\nRosewood has plenty of humour, too, but the breakneck-speed element can lead to some unintentionally funny moments. In one of the episodes, the villain was caught in a manner that really reminded me of an episode of another Fox show, The Grinder (also on City in Canada).\nThe Grinder, however, is a sitcom. What's more, the scene to which I'm referring actually occurred during an episode of the dumbed-down drama that exists within the real sitcom. So it was played for laughs when Rob Lowe's character tricked the criminal into confessing, with the authorities waiting right outside the door.\nIn Rosewood, it wasn't a joke. That's really what happened.\nOn the positive side for Rosewood, it is bright and brisk and cute and curt. It moves along, there's no doubt about that.\nAnd the lead character is fertile territory for Chestnut, a veteran actor whose recent TV gigs include Legends, Nurse Jackie, American Horror Story (the first season) and V, as well as recent movies The Perfect Guy, The Best Man Holiday, Kick-Ass 2, The Call and Identity Thief.\nChestnut joked that he knows better than to feel too comfortable on Rosewood, given Rosie's medical condition.\n\"Actors nowadays, they always put in there that your character can die at any minute,\" Chestnut said. \"That's (creator Todd Harthan's) way of keeping me in check.\n\"(My character) can die at any minute and be replaced.\"\nHeaven forbid. What would Rosewood be called then?\nI've admitted I was wrong about the name. Don't make me learn a new one.\nTwitter: @billharris_tv\nbill.harris@sunmedia.ca\nMorris Chestnut's 'Rosewood' finds a way to bloom\nBy Bill Harris , Postmedia Network First posted: Tuesday, October 20, 2015 10:30 AM EDT | Updated: Tuesday, October 20, 2015 11:05 AM EDT\nEverything's coming up Rosewood.\nSo I guess I was wrong.
