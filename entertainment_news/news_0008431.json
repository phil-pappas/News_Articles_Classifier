This year's Great British Bake Off final was clearly the most emotional , with tears flowing from the moment it started until Nadiya Hussain was crowned the winner . \n© BBC She told Alan Carr: \"I love them. When people come for them and attack them I hate it. I hate it! Because they want to make a perfect scone? Who deserves being battered for trying to make a perfect scone?\"She admitted she was really happy Nadiya took home the trophy: \"She had no confidence and she slowly bloomed and she delivered and she is a beautiful, beautiful woman and made some great bakes. Very well deserved.\" \n© Twitter / @DrRayBakes She then gushed about Tamal: \"He is beautiful. He will not be single for long that boy. I think he is. Tamal if you are not I'm really sorry. He is wonderful. \"And the fact that sometimes this show is subject to heavy tabloid scrutiny and this guy is an anaesthetist in the day. He works as an anaesthetist, and then came at night and baked, and at the weekends gave his time and all of them deserve so much respect. \n© BBC \"They're good eggs who have normal jobs and just want to be good bakers.\" Throughout the final over on Twitter, there was more sobbing going on than innuendo watch, which was definitely a first.
