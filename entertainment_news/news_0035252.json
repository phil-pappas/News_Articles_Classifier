He started the crowd-funding site chuffed.org after realising how much his friends — who were bankers, lawyers and accountants — hated being stopped by charity workers in the street.\nA familiar sight. Picture: Annette Dew Source: News Limited\n“In their head all they could see was the charity mugger on the street, harassing them on their way to work,” he said.\n“It was problematic, no one enjoys that experience, even those who work in the sector avoid those guys.”\nHe found dislike of charity muggers was something that people could universally connect on, regardless of how generous they were.\n“These guys are not stingy, they want to contribute, they just don’t like the way that charities interact with them, particularly the big ones, we wanted to find a different way to link them ... and that’s how we started Chuffed.”\nOne way that new forms of fundraising differ from the traditional charity mugger or telemarketing approach is that they can offer more to donors than just the feel-good factor of giving, and this could actually benefit the charity.\nParamanathan said campaigns that gave donors something back in return were often the most successful for chuffed.org, which has become Australia’s largest crowd-funding platforms for social causes, raising $5 million since it launched in October 2013.\nThis could actually be a good thing, Paramanathan said, because it tapped into people’s retail spending, not their “charitable purse”.\nFree flights for charity muggers 0:42 Play video\nHerald Sun reporter Mark Dunn explaining why there's so many backpackers working as charity collectors\nHerald Sun 10 Jun 2014 News For example, many of those who donated $250 to build a rooftop garden in Sydney’s Kings Cross last year, received a free cooking lesson and gave it to friends or family as Christmas presents.\n“This money wasn’t tagged to go to a homeless shelter, it was tagged to go to a big retailer, Myer or DJs,” Paramanathan said.\nHe said providing a reward for donating meant you could tap into people’s “spending purse” and a massive amount of money that would not normally go towards charity.\n“If you rely solely on benevolence, all you get is people to open their charitable purse,” he said.\nINVESTORS ALSO GETTING ON BOARD\nThe trend towards a win-win outcome can also be seen in the launch of funds aimed at making a profit for their investors, but also donating to charities.\nLast year, legendary fund manager Geoff Wilson raised $200 million from investors to launch the Future Generation Investment Company (FGIC), a managed fund listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). The fund donates 1 per cent of its net tangible assets to Australian charities every year.\nIt manages to save money by asking big-name investment houses to waive their management and outperformance fees. This helps people who invest in the fund to enjoy good returns, while also giving to charity.\nGeoff Wilson has set up two charitable management funds. Picture: Britta Campion Source: News Corp Australia\nThis month FGIC made its first donation of $1.644 million, which was divided between 14 Australian children’s charities including Kids Helpline, Variety and the Lighthouse Foundation.\nA second fund focused on global shares, the Future Generation Global Company (FGG), was launched last month and hopes to donate about $3 million a year to nine Australian charities focused on mental illness including Beyond Blue, Black Dog Institute and the Brain and Mind Research Institute.\nBoth funds are open to the public who can invest for as little as $2000. In the case of FGG, investors need to purchase 2000 shares, which is currently trading around $1.10 per share.\nIn spruiking his fund, Wilson, who has put $3 million of his own money into FGG, made sure to highlight, not just the feel-good factor to giving, but also the potential financial benefits.\n“As well as making a social impact, investors have the opportunity to gain unprecedented access to Australia’s most prominent global fund managers — a number of whom are not accessible to retail investors,” he told The Australian .\nFGG joint chief executive officer Louise Walsh told news.com.au $302 million had been raised for the latest fund, which made it the second biggest listed management company ever to launch in Australia.\nShe said fund managers agreed to work for free as they “liked the charitable side of things” but it didn’t hurt their business either. In fact the marketing could help some overseas managers to gain exposure to the Australian superannuation market, which is the third biggest in the world.\nWalsh said getting the managers to work for free saved on the 1.3 per cent fee managers ordinarily charge, but also the performance fee, which is on average 16 per cent, if the fund outperformed on expectations.\nUnlike traditional ethical investing, which generally involves avoiding certain industries or stocks such as those for mining companies, the fund managers chosen to oversee FGG investments were selected based on their financial performance, not necessarily on what they invest in.\n“That’s why it’s so exciting,” Walsh said, “the investment opportunity combines creating investor wealth but also the social return, it’s unusual to have social return and investor return in the one vehicle”.\nPlaying the stockmarket could be good for your bank balance and for charity. Picture: AFP/William West Source: AFP\nCharities also benefit because the funding is long term and ongoing, as long as they continue to meet performance targets, in contrast to government funding which is usually granted every three to five years.\n“Come September next year, we will start giving away about $3 million a year,” Walsh said.\n“We expect to build this into a $1-$2 billion company within 10 years, which would see $10-$20 million a year being donated.\n“We are hoping that this will inspire others in the corporate sector to do different things.”\nBUT CAN IT REALLY BE WIN-WIN?\nFrom a purely financial view, Evan Lucas, market strategist at IG, said the performance of Wilson’s first company Future Generation Investment Company (FGIC) had been pretty flat since launching at $1.08 in September last year.\nHe said the value of the fund on Thursday was $1.06, coming down from a high of $1.15 in April. The stock has got as low as $1.02.\nLucas said the price was tracking the market pretty closely and there was almost no discernible difference.\n“It’s doing enough to make investing in the fund look attractive ... but if your primary objective is to make money it’s not a massive moneymaker, it’s not a maximum return or growth fund,” Lucas said.\nHe said ethical funds were interesting as there were pros and cons to them.\n“It gives you a nice feeling to invest ethically ... but it can get in the way of the direction of a fund, which is to create value.”\nThis was especially true of funds that limited the stocks that they invested in, such as not buying mining shares or not investing in biomedical research because of animal research.\n“But some would argue that they are happy because of the social growth they get out of them,” he said.\nRosemary Addis, co-founder and chair of Impact Investing Australia, said there was not necessarily a trade-off between “doing good and doing well”.\nShe said the returns from socially responsible investments were not fully understood yet.\n“There’s an assumption that social investments are risky but that’s not always true,” she said.\n“It all depends on where you target investment, in some cases some investors chose a lower return in order to have a lower or different social impact.”\nAddis said that “impact investing” was the next evolution of socially responsible investing, which traditionally screens out “negative” investments such as those in tobacco companies.\nInstead, impact investing purposely designs investments so they have a positive impact. Addis said one of the most successful examples in Australia recently was the purchase of the failed ABC Learning child care centres by Goodstart Early Learning, which was funded by a group of charities which raised $95 million. All investors were eventually repaid in full at the agreed rate of return.\nOther projects featured on Impact Investing’s website include a $4.6 million fund to provide high-quality instruments for the Australian Chamber Orchestra and a $50 million fund to construct a wind farm in Victoria.\nProjects like these can actually save governments, and the community, money.\nThe NSW state government has recognised the potential in the sector, establishing an Office of Social Impact Investment to encourage its growth.\nIt was the first government in Australia to offer a social benefit bond, which raised money from private investors to support a parenting skills program for at-risk families. In the first two years, 66 children have been returned to their families, exceeding expectations, and investors received a 8.9 per cent return on their investment in the second year.\nThese bonds were first developed in the UK in 2010 and have since been used across North America and Europe. Cost savings to government are used to repay the upfront investment plus a financial return.\nAs these new types of investments become more common, Addis said more information would become available to investors, making it easier for them to analyse the risk and returns, and there would gradually be more experts that could advise people.\nAddis said there was definitely growing momentum around impact investing.\n“Five years ago I was mainly asked to speak at forums of community business partnerships, or where people were already interested in community partnerships,” she said.\n“Now I’m regularly asked to speak at investment forums in Australia, the region and globally.”\nOn Monday the first Impact Investment Summit Asia-Pacific will be held in Sydney, and Addis said she thought a number of factors were driving an interest in the sector.\n“First is the pressure on government budgets and people are starting to think ‘if the government can’t pay for things then what else are we going to do?’,” she said.\nPeople also want quality outcomes for money spent and these things are combining with the rise of a new style of entrepreneur, “who want meaning to be part of what they do,” and are creating new models for doing things.\n“Lastly, a growing number of investors want more options in a way that is more aligned with their values,” she said.\nOriginally published as The end of the charity mugger?
