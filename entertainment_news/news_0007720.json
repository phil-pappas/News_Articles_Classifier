I got to the point where I went a bit mad. I was completely suicidal, I didn't want to live any more,\" she said in a Q&A with Rupert Everett. \"I thought that I was completely alone. I also realized how lucky I was, and what a wonderful family and wonderful friends I had, but that didn't matter. I wanted the world to swallow me up. ​\"\n More From Cosmopolitan And after her newfound success, Cara realized those feelings weren't just going to go away. \" ​In our culture we are told that if we are beautiful, if we are skinny, if we are successful, famous, if we fit in, if everyone loves us, that we'll be happy. But that's not entirely true,\" she said.\nCara went on to detail her experience with anti-depressants and therapy, and credits yoga and learning how to say \"no\" as being part of her recovery.\nShe's not the only one to make this type of revelation recently.

Because as anyone suffering through it knows, depression is bad enough without shame layered on top.\n​ Follow Marie Claire on Instagram for the latest celeb news, pretty pics, funny stuff, and an insider POV. ​ ​ ​", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/marieclairemag", "http://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/news/a16370/sarah-silverman-depression/", "http://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/news/a14046/cara-delevingne-suki-waterhouse-georgia-jagger-band/"], "published": "2015-10-14T20:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:51:44.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
