The buck stops with Emanuel. And this deal had trouble written all over it.\nEmanuel's hand-picked school board voted unanimously to award the lucrative contract to SUPES Academy — former employer of schools' CEO Barbara Byrd-Bennett — without even exploring whether another company could do the work better or for less money.\nAn educational nonprofit that underwrote a SUPES pilot program to train midlevel administrators had refused to sponsor a second year, much less to expand the program to training principals.\nSo many red flags. Why would City Hall not be involved in such a decision?\nMore to the point: Why has Emanuel fought so hard to withhold public records that would shed light on how the deal came together?\nLast week, Chicago taxpayers learned part of the story, as U.S. Attorney Zachary Fardon announced fraud and bribery charges against Byrd-Bennett and two officials of Wilmette-based SUPES and their businesses.\nFederal prosecutors say Byrd-Bennett stood to collect up to $2.3 million in kickbacks for steering business to her former bosses. She is expected to plead guilty, as is at least one of her co-defendants. We expect to learn more about this deal from prosecutors. But Emanuel would be wise to start filling in the blanks now.\nCorruption at the top of Chicago Public Schools Editorial Board How did a north suburban consulting company land a $20.5 million no-bid contract to train principals for the Chicago Public Schools?\nThat's been an open question since April, when CPS revealed it had been served with federal subpoenas for documents related to its dealings with Wilmette-based SUPES...\nHow did a north suburban consulting company land a $20.5 million no-bid contract to train principals for the Chicago Public Schools?\nThat's been an open question since April, when CPS revealed it had been served with federal subpoenas for documents related to its dealings with Wilmette-based SUPES...\n(Editorial Board) For months, the Tribune has been pressing his administration over its refusal to hand over public documents that would shed light on the SUPES deal. Email logs show frequent exchanges between mayoral staffers, CPS officials and SUPES in the weeks leading up to the school board's June 2013 vote.\nCity Hall released some of the emails, redacted so heavily that they are almost comically useless, and withheld the rest, forcing the Tribune to file suit under the Illinois Freedom of Information Act.\nAfter prosecutors announced the charges last week, City Hall released a handful of previously withheld emails showing that — what do you know? — Emanuel aides had raised some important questions about the deal. They backed off when Byrd-Bennett got her back up.\n\"The mayor's office has asked us for additional information on the SUPES board report,\" a now-former CPS aide wrote to then-personnel director Alicia Winckler on June 24, 2013.\nAmong the questions: How much money did CPS already spend on principal training? Would the SUPES program replace current programs? Where would the money come from? Were there other customers who could vouch for the program?\nTriple B's guilty plea is an A-plus move Eric Zorn Former Chicago Public Schools CEO Barbara Byrd-Bennett has evidently done some dumb things in her life, to put it mildly. But she's made a very smart decision to not contest the federal charges announced against her Thursday.\nHer lawyer and prosecutors said Byrd-Bennett is cooperating with authorities...\nFormer Chicago Public Schools CEO Barbara Byrd-Bennett has evidently done some dumb things in her life, to put it mildly. But she's made a very smart decision to not contest the federal charges announced against her Thursday.\nHer lawyer and prosecutors said Byrd-Bennett is cooperating with authorities...\n(Eric Zorn) \"There is some concern that we're spending a large sum on some principals while laying off others and teachers,\" the email says.\nByrd-Bennett pushed back angrily: \"I can not be second guessed like this…the level of micromanaging by people who have no track record and have not led or managed anything is in some ways insulting….Either people think I can do this or…what do they want?\"\n\"She was pissed,\" SUPES co-owner Gary Solomon wrote to Winckler in another email thread.\nCity Hall's response, apparently: Never mind! Two days later, the Board of Education waved the deal through with no public discussion whatsoever.\nWhy was it so easy for Byrd-Bennett to shut down her questioners? Emanuel needed her, and she knew it. She'd helped broker a resolution to the 2012 teachers strike as second-in-command to then-CEO Jean-Claude Brizard, and was named to replace him that October.\nThe relationships she forged with parents and with Chicago Teachers Union President Karen Lewis helped the city weather the closing of 50 underenrolled schools, most of them in black neighborhoods. She supported Emanuel's push to open new charter schools.\nAll the while, she was feathering her own nest at the expense of Chicago's schoolchildren, according to prosecutors.\nAll of this happened on Emanuel's watch. The citizens of Chicago are entitled to know what the mayor's administration knew or didn't know, did or didn't do.\nThere are rules in place to guard against conflicts of interest in the awarding of CPS contracts, and to make sure those deals provide taxpayers with the best return for their money. Those rules were waived, despite some clear warning signs, by six people who answered directly to the mayor.\nInstead of applying the brakes so they could get answers to some very basic questions, the school board fast-tracked one of the largest no-bid contracts in memory. Why?\nThe public is entitled to see the emails that City Hall wants to keep secret. We're confident a judge will shake them loose, pursuant to the state's Freedom of Information Act, if the U.S. attorney doesn't share them first.\nEmanuel could — should — hand them over now.\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Rahm Emanuel Barbara Byrd-Bennett Chicago Public Schools Chicago City Hall Opinion Jean-Claude Brizard Editorials", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561711ad/turbine/ct-edit-cps-byrd-bennett-corruption-indictment-edit-1009-jm-20151008", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561c3b8b/turbine/ct-supes-contract-cps-edit-1013-20151012", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561832a4/turbine/ct-barbara-byrd-bennett-smart-guilty-perspec-zorn-1011-jm-20151009"], "published": "2015-10-13T01:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:15:52.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
