Picture: Supplied Shannon Molloy News Corp Australia Network Share Email a friend \nOPINION \nCOMMERCIAL television’s take on hit ABC discussion show Q&A last night was the small screen equivalent of haemorrhoids — a sudden pain in the arse that’s tricky to get rid of. \nAnd we lapped it up. The ratings are in and The Verdict on Channel Nine is a modest hit, with 522,000 people tuning in, a reasonable result in a late-ish but congested timeslot on a dead night. \nThe Karl Stefanovic-hosted hour of adults wildly screeching and spewing stupidity at each other smashed SBS’s brilliant new local drama The Principal and was only just behind Ten’s Gogglebox , both on at the same time. \nIn short, Australia — you get the garbage television you deserve. Unsurprising outcome ... the controversies to arise from the first episode of The Verdict are no accident. Picture: Supplied Source: Channel 9 \nLike reality TV shows we all seem to whinge about, but which continue to rate their socks off, or sports variety programs that lurch from a sexism scandal to even higher audience numbers the very next week, we’re addicted to stuff that pisses us off. \nOutrage has become a pretty effective sales tool, regardless of the medium. It’s why people like Kyle Sanidlands still have radio shows. \nAnd we keep falling for it — especially on television. \nWe’re sucked in by scandals and controversies that look organic but are little more than scripted stunts, straight from the playbooks of crafty producers who know what makes us tick. \nTake Mark Latham’s grossly offensive comments about mental health, which caused widespread condemnation within minutes. They were not an accident. \nCampbell Brown blurting out that someone’s mother should’ve aborted them was also a headline-grabbing result of careful planning. Outrage sells ... we’re addicted to stuff that pisses us off and that’s what TV networks will continue to serve up. Picture: Supplied Source: Channel 9 \nTalk about a “Muslim problem” in Australia, coupled with blanket statements that make no sense and downright offensive proclamations that ignore rationale and reason ... all part of the plan. \nWhether it’s rage-inducing panel shows or copycat cooking and renovation reality series, we’re being taken for fools. \nAnd by buying a ticket and jumping on board a guaranteed train wreck like The Verdict , you gave the show a pretty decent ratings result and ensured it lives another week. \nBy Tweeting along, poking fun on Facebook or feverishly agreeing with co-workers around the water cooler that we’re all dumber for having seen it, you’re promoting it, and encouraging others to slide down the rabbit hole next time. \nAnd so the whole cycle of stupid begins all over again. It’s actually a bit genius if you think about it. Switch off ... if it’s bad or takes you for a fool, stop watching it. TV networks will pretty quickly get the message. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied \nMy mum used to tell me to ignore school bullies — most of the time, they’d get bored by the lack of attention at some point and move on to someone else, she said. \nIt’s time we do the same with TV, I say. \nThe stuff they want us to hate and be outraged by, the stupid stuff served up time and time again that we devour even though we hate the taste of it … switch off. Support quality instead. \nOr just keep going back for more, walking into the bully’s fist with glee each day. It’s entirely up to you. \nJust don’t complain when the same old trash ends up on screens. \nShannon Molloy is a National TV Writer for News Corp Australia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:44:09.736+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
