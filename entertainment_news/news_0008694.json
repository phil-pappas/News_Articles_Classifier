The answer is simple: Director Brad Peyton tries to up the ante with so much computer-generated devastation that he loses whatever momentum he had going. The filmmakers and the actors take \"San Andreas\" seriously, which is a welcome change of pace, but this earthquake epic is riddled with (ahem) too many faults. Extras: featurettes, deleted scenes, gag reel and commentary by Peyton. \nSPY (2015, Fox, R, $30) — In the latest collaboration between writer/director Paul Feig (\"Bridesmaids\") and Melissa McCarthy, the actress plays a deskbound CIA analyst who takes over a field operation involving a missing nuclear bomb and a devious Bulgarian arms dealer (Rose Byrne). There's just enough plot to give this espionage yarn narrative force but not enough to get in the way of the laughs. And there are plenty of laughs, thanks to McCarthy's competition with a fellow agent (Jason Statham), her verbal sparring with Byrne and her inspired physical shtick. \"Spy\" ranks as one of the most uproarious films of the year. Extras: commentaries, deleted scenes, outtakes and featurettes. Buy this photo Available \nTOMORROWLAND (2015, Disney, PG, $30) — The big selling point of this sci-fi extravaganza from director Brad Bird (\"The Incredibles\") and Teaneck's Damon Lindelof (\"Lost\") is that it imagines a futuristic utopia full of jet packs, silvery skyscrapers and flying cars. But that glittering paradise is about all \"Tomorrowland\" has going for it — that and a crackerjack performance by newcomer Raffey Cassidy as a bossy robot. The rest of the movie, which finds Britt Robertson teaming up with George Clooney to save the world, is a real slog. Particularly grating is the last act, which descends into a long sermon about the danger of giving up hope. Deadly. Extras: deleted scenes and featurettes. \nMAGIC MIKE XXL (2015, Warner, R, $30) — Set three years after the events depicted in the original 2012 film, this plotless, Matthew McConaughey-less sequel involves the guys (Channing Tatum, Matt Bomer, Joe Manganiello) hitting the road for a male stripper convention. Manganiello gets the best scene when he shakes his booty for a bored convenience store owner, but much of the rest of this underlit movie involves the guys sitting around shooting the breeze. Scenes are so loose and unformed, it's almost as if they were made up on the spot. Worst of all, the dance routines are largely devoid of sizzle and style. Extras: featurettes. Buy this photo \nMANGLEHORN (2015, IFC, PG-13, $25) — From David Gordon Green (\"Prince Avalanche\") comes the gentle saga of a lonely locksmith (Al Pacino) still pining the loss, decades earlier, of the only woman he ever loved. Even though Pacino isn't particularly believable as a Texas sad sack, he draws you in and makes you care about his character's predicament. Going head to toe with Pacino is Holly Hunter, who brings a touching delicacy to her role as the cheerful bank teller who catches Manglehorn's eye. Extras: none. \nINSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 3 (2015, Sony, PG-13, $30) — Billed as a prequel to the \"Insidious\" films, the latest from \"Saw\" mastermind Leigh Whannell essentially repeats the formula with all new characters. It's pretty unexciting stuff. But Whannell has, at the very least, written a meaty role for scream queen Lin Shaye, who returns to the franchise to deliver a badass turn as an elderly psychic who goes to hell and back to save a possessed teenager (Stefanie Scott). Extras: featurettes. Buy this photo \nPEOPLE PLACES THINGS (2015, Alchemy, R, $20) — After the mother of his children leaves him for another man, graphic novelist Will Henry (Jemaine Clement) is forced to start all over again. He juggles two jobs, cares for his twin daughters and begins dating the mom (Regina Hall) of one of his students. Writer/director Jim Strouse (\"Grace Is Gone\") stocks the first half of this ultra-mild comedy with scenes of Clement clowning around with his kids (the adorable Gia and Aundera Gadsby), but the romance with Hall gets surprisingly short shrift. \"People Places\" isn't bad; it's barely there. Extras: none. \nNIGHT AND THE CITY (1950, Criterion, unrated, $30) — One of the best film noirs of the 1950s, this moody, atmospheric gem centers on Harry Fabian (Richard Widmark), a hustler who longs for \"a life of ease and plenty.\" As he tries to muscle into the world of wrestling promotion, he robs from his loyal girlfriend (a lovely Gene Tierney) and attempts to play a number of shady characters (Francis L. Sullivan, Googie Withers, Herbert Lom) against each other. Director Jules Dassin captures a London underworld of constantly shifting loyalties. Forget about the 1992 remake starring Robert De Niro; this \"Night and the City\" is the one to see. Extras: a six-minutes-longer British version and featurettes. \nALADDIN: DIAMOND EDITION (1992, Disney, G, $40) — Looking — and sounding — better than ever on this newly remastered Blu-ray, Disney's feisty spin on \"Arabian Nights\" gives Robin Williams a chance to cut loose with a torrent of funny business. As the Genie, the late actor has a blast, and his enthusiasm is contagious. If you can get through Williams' impressions of Jack Nicholson, Robert De Niro and Ed Sullivan without laughing, you might be lacking a funny bone. Extras: Williams outtakes, featurettes and deleted songs \nSOME KIND OF HERO (1982, Olive, R, $20) — There's a really good movie fighting to get out of this adaptation of James Kirkwood's novel about a Vietnam War P.O.W. (Richard Pryor) struggling to adapt to civilian life. Once on American soil, Eddie Keller gets hit with a tsunami of bad news: His wife wants to leave him, his business is bankrupt, and his mother is confined to a nursing home. There's comedy in so much crisis, but director Michael Pressman never finds the right tone. Still, in the quieter scenes featuring Margot Kidder or when Eddie fumbles a bank robbery, Pryor is at his tragicomic best. He turns \"Hero\" into some kind of lost gem. Extras: none. \nMURDER, MY SWEET (1945, Warner Archive, unrated, $20) — Before \"Chinatown\" and \"True Detective,\" there was this nasty little thriller about Philip Marlowe (Dick Powell), a gumshoe tasked with solving a dark mystery involving the missing girlfriend of a hoodlum (Mike Mazurki). But the plot, which expands to include the gold-digging wife (Claire Trevor) of an elderly sugar daddy, is secondary to the hard-boiled atmosphere. Thanks to a strong screenplay by John Paxton and stronger direction by Edward Dmytryk, the new-to-Blu-ray \"Murder\" takes place in a moral vacuum where nobody seems capable of holding on to his or her integrity. Extras: commentary track. \nMAD MEN: THE FINAL SEASON — PART TWO (2015, Lionsgate, unrated, $33) — Who would have thought that after making it through so many tough times, the gang at Sterling Cooper would be gobbled up by McCann-Erikson? That's just one of the twists unleashed during the final batch of episodes of TV's best drama. Perhaps the biggest surprise comes when Don (John Hamm) takes off for California early in the season, hoping for reinvention yet again. Almost everyone gets a happy-ish ending except for Betty (January Jones), but at least the episode devoted to the former Mrs. Draper is an enormously moving one that allows her to reconnect with Don. The finale, like most episodes of the show, serves up dark poetry and rueful laughs. Extras: featurettes and commentaries. \nDEXTER: THE COMPLETE SERIES (2006-2013, Paramount, unrated, $99) — Talk about a killer deal. Included in this set are all eight seasons and 96 episodes of the Showtime series about a Miami crime-solver (Michael C. Hall) who leads a secret life as a vigilante serial killer. A four-time Emmy nominee for Best Drama, \"Dexter\" experienced a dip in quality during its final seasons. Yet even at its weakest, \"Dexter\" delivers enough macabre mayhem to keep you on the hook. Extras: commentaries and featurettes. \nTHE LEFTOVERS: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON (2014, Warner, unrated, $40) — From Damon Lindelof comes a show that revels in its mysteries. Set three years after 2 percent of the world's population vanished, the series follows police chief Kevin Garvey (Justin Theroux) as he struggles to regain a sense of normalcy in Mapleton, N.Y. At its heart, the provocative \"Leftovers\" is about faith, loss and the challenges of everyday living. Extras: commentaries and featurettes. \n— Amy Longsdorf © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:20:54.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
