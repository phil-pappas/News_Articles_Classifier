What does it mean to be confident? It means letting go, being authentic, saying I don’t give a f@*k and this is who I am. I want to show the side of me that’s real, that’s liberated, that’s free.” Other Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T20:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T23:33:23.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
