An image from the Topps card trader app suggests that there is someone else, besides Han Solo ( Harrison Ford ), who will be the pilot of the Millennium Falcon in the upcoming sci-fi film. The image puts spotlight on Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) while also showing Daisy Ridley 's Rey sitting next to the Wookiee warrior at the controls of the Millennium Falcon. However, this doesn't mean that she's the one flying the Falcon. She is presumably involved in an exclusive club that includes Lando Calrissian, Nien Nunb and others who have taken control of the spaceship. There has been a speculation that Rey will take over the control in the cockpit while Han operates one of the turrets. Since Rey's last name has yet to be revealed, speculations about who she actually is are mounting. She is said to be a blood relative of Luke Skywalker ( Mark Hamill ) and perhaps the daughter of Han and Princess Leia ( Carrie Fisher ). However, there is also a rumor that instead of a relative, Rey is in fact Luke's chosen apprentice, an orphan selected for training at a young age. \"The Force Awakens\" also stars Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron, John Boyega as Finn, Gwendoline Christie as Captain Phasma, Adam Driver as Kylo Ren, Lupita Nyong'o as Maz Kanata and Domhnall Gleeson as General Hux. Directed by J.J. Abrams, the sci-fi movie is due to arrive Statesides on December 18. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Star Wars: The Force Awakens News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T06:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:19:33.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
