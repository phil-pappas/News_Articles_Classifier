His play, based on real murders that took place in Fall River, Mass. in 1892, is titled \"Lizzie Borden Took an Axe\", and it went from local acclaim, to performances in several out-of-town venues, and even to Fall River for an added touch of authenticity. \nOn Thursday evening, I attended the last opening of \"Lizzie Borden...\", and, sadly, the last opening for Covey Theatre Company. Somehow, it seems fitting and right that \"Lizzie\" ushered in the company, and now, she ushers it out. They are closing their curtains for good at the end of this play's run . As I was told, Heater and his partners, Susan Blumer and Michael Penny, had decided five years earlier that they would stick it out, through thick and thin, for a five-year run. They are keeping the promise they made to one another. They are to be congratulated for their clear vision and discipline, but more so, for the fine pieces of quality theater they produced in an all-too-short run. The Syracuse theater community has been enriched by their fine efforts, and now is lessened by their impending demise. The Covey Theatre Company will be missed. \nFive years ago, I wrote, \"The new company opened its first performance on Friday evening to the applause of a substantial audience who got what they came for: taut, interesting drama, performed well.\" The current reprise of the play duplicates those kudos and adds large doses of authenticity by moving the production from a conventional stage setting (it had been performed in the BeVard Studio space of the Mulroy Civic Center five years ago) to a mansion on James Street with the look and feel of late 19th century, well-heeled gentility, surroundings not unlike the real historical location. The current production is being performed in several rooms of the Barnes Hiscock Mansion at 930 James St., Syracuse . \nMounting a production in this manner is no easy task. That is, instead of providing set changes that are, essentially, brought to the audience, the audience is brought to the set changes by way of being ushered from room to room as the mood, characters, and plot line dictate. Heater not only has directed this production, but now fulfills the duty of a stage manager of sorts as he \"high signs\" the audience to move to the location of the next scene. \nThis unusual delivery of what is pretty much a conventional play offers advantages and disadvantages. Authenticity of the play's social and household milieu is, obviously, chief among the advantages. No painted lumber on wheels for fake walls or fabric backgrounds descending from the fly space for this \"Lizzie\".You're in a real house replete with memories and secrets that are revealed as you go from room to room. Another genuine advantage is the proximity of the actors to the audience. At times, you feel like you're actually in the scene with, literally, a foot or so separation from an actor. This increased immediacy to the drama lends additional nuance to the understanding of character. \nOf course, these advantages to such a radical departure of presentation come at a price. I found the main problem to be the breaking of mood and concentration. Instead of a relatively continuous flow of the characters' activities, wherein we are privy to their world for the play's duration, the drama unfolds like a series of related vignettes, where we have to continuously readjust our concentration from the inner world of the play to our own outer world of moving from room to room. Another problem is the actual movement and readjustment of the audience, particularly if the attendance outnumbers the seats in a given room as it did on opening night. I stood, leaning on walls, for at least half of the play. \nNot only does audience comfort enter into the picture, but perhaps the number of people moving through the hallways and stairs necessitated the start of some scenes before the total audience had arrived. This occurred in at least two or three of the \"talky\" parlor scenes that involved two or three characters, however, this is a simple one to remedy by waiting for the total audience to arrive, and perhaps cutting audience numbers for each performance. \nMany of the original cast members are in this production, retaining their former roles. Among them are Jodi Bova-Mele (Lizzie), Kate Huddleston (Abigail, Lizzie's stepmother), Carmen Viviano-Crafts (Emma, Lizzie's sister), Susan Blumer (Adelaide, a friend and confidante of the Borden family), and Chuck Parsons (Lizzie's Uncle John). New to this production are Mark Cole (Lizzie's dominant father), Sara Weiler (Bridget \"Maggie\" the maid) Zach Chase (Dr. Bowen), and Maya Dwyer (Lizzie's friend and close confidante). \nThe cast assembled for this production exhibits a high degree of professionalism in not only injecting realism and believability into their respective roles, but also demonstrates a high degree of discipline as they deliver lines among audience members who have, essentially, invaded their space in this very different dissolution of the traditional \"fourth wall\" of theater that, traditionally, separates actor from audience. \nGiven the reputation of the company and the play, together with this very different presentation, it's no wonder that by curtain time Thursday night, all eight planned performances were sold out. Bravo, Covey! \nThe Details \nLength of Performance : Two hours, 10 minutes (including a 15-minute intermission). Attendance : Approximately 45. Family Guide : Despite its bloodless presentation, the adult themes, including the suspicion of incest, necessitate a \"mature audience\" recommendation. \nInfo : The Covey Theatre Company presents their last production, \"Lizzie Borden Took an Axe\" at the Barnes Hiscock Mansion, 930 James St., Syracuse (ample parking lot left of building) from October 15 through October 30.
