The 6th Beijing Biennale with its theme \"Memory and Dream\" is a great event that links history with reality, connects the past and the future, and could be best placed to reflect the humanistic care of artists, arouses their passion to paint and inspire artists' aesthetic imagination. In addition, I would like to emphasize that the Beijing Biennale is a featured exhibition, it is different from the rest major Biennales of the world. The Beijing Biennale is a large-scale international art exhibition, really qualified with high standards. With the great topic \"Memory and Dream\", it emphasizes the unique form of contemporary painting and sculpture. The Beijing Biennale has great international influences on many aspects: the art market, the cooperation between different countries, the development of each individual artist, etc. They all come to share the dream of partnerships and long- term developments between different countries. The Beijing Biennale helps us all to head to a bright future, where all our dreams can come true.\"\nSince the opening ceremony of the 6 th Beijing Biennale, average daily amount of audience is close to 10.000, which showcases their enthusiasm.
