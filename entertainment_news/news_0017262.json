How will they top that? I’m sure they’re saving something special for the series finale (tonight at 10 on Cinemax). Stars Philip Winchester and Sullivan Stapleton have moved on to other series (“The Player” and “Blindspot” respectively), but there’s talk of a big-screen reunion film.\nLast week, it was “Beverly Hills, 90210.” Now Lifetime turns to its spin­off in “The Unauthorized Melrose Place Story” (tomorrow at 8 p.m.) with knockoffs of Heather Locklear, Grant Show and Daphne Zuniga re-enacting alleged backstage drama.\nOn “The Last Kingdom” (series premiere tomorrow at 10 p.m. on BBC America), get ready for some Dark Ages mayhem. Based on the eight-book series “The Saxon Stories” by Bernard Cornwell, it tells the tale of a ninth century boy named Uhtred who is kidnapped by Danes and grows to become a warrior.\nOprah chats up Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and Pakistani activist Malala You­safzai about her mission to educate girls and why she has never been angry at the man who shot her on “SuperSoul Sunday” (Sunday at 7 p.m. on OWN).\nOn the season finale of “Your Pretty Face Is Going to Hell” — surely the best TV title ever (sorry, “Sex Sent Me to the ER”) — a clerical error could mean Gary is going to heaven (Monday at 12:15 a.m. on Adult Swim).
