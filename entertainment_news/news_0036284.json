On Thursday, the District Attorney of Queens County issued a press release outlining charges against the accused man, identified as 25-year-old Anthony Esteves.\nEsteves brought a skeletal boxer to a city animal shelter on October 13 - he claimed that he had found the dog, who was so weak that he could not walk. The emaciated dog weighed a mere 25 pounds when he was first brought to the facility; he should have weighed over 60 pounds.\nAccording to the New York Daily News, Esteves eventually admitted that he owned the boxer, dubbed \"Brewster,\" and stated that he did not want the dog to die in his bedroom. The District Attorney issued a statement about the case, \" The defendant is accused of showing a complete disregard for the well-being of this helpless animal when he failed to provide the basic necessities required to maintain the animal’s health, I commend the Daily News for bringing the matter to the attention of authorities.”\nBrewster is being cared for by the Adopt-A-Boxer rescue group, which has noted that the dog continues to put on weight as he recovers in a foster home. Esteves is facing multiple charges, including aggravated cruelty to animals, first-degree falsifying business records and two counts of overdriving, torturing and injuring animals and failure to provide sustenance. He could face up to four years in prison if convicted.\nNational Dog News Examiner on Facebook (click 'get notifications' on the page to receive updates).", "external_links": ["http://www.queensda.org/newpressreleases/2015/Oct%202015/esteves_10_20_2015.pdf", "https://www.facebook.com/adoptaboxerrescue", "http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/accused-dog-abuser-posed-rescuer-officials-article-1.2407385", "https://www.facebook.com/National-Dog-News-Examiner-151051931581705/"], "published": "2015-10-23T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:40:48.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
