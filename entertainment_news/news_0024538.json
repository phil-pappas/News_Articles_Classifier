The Pokkiri actress' marriage with co-founder of Micromax Informatics & YU Televentures and entrepreneur, Rahul Sharma will take place in New Delhi at a hotel, according to a report. \nThe wedding, it is said, will be a private affair limited only to family and close friends. Some of Nation's top business magnates and prominent film stars are expected to make the cut in the final list of invitees. Major South Indian celebrities too are expected to attend the event come November 26th. \nBut the gala doesn't stop there, for the couple has decided to throw a reception party the next day (November 27th) at a farmhouse. It is to be noted that Asin is celebrating her 30th birthday tomorrow (26th October) and hence the announcement of the wedding date couldn't have come at a better time, one might say. \nAs reported earlier, Asin might take a break from appearing on the silver screen after her marriage. The Ghajini actress has also stopped signing newer projects in order to concentrate more on her personal life, thus turning a blind eye to her professional one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T14:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T21:16:55.372+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
