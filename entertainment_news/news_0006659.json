Groans as the game dragged on and Cubs hitters struggled to score runs. Some barstool-managers were upset Joe Maddon didn't pull Jon Lester because he wasn't quite as sharp as Mets ace Matt Harvey, who one fan said was \"on point.\"\nBut Cubs fans said they believed the pennant would come to the North Siders in the end.\n\"Why not this year?\" said 39-year old Andy Tarnoff, who noted that it's the Year of the Goat, and the 1989 \"Back to the Future II\" movie predicted the Cubs' victory.\nOthers at Sluggers, a popular bar in Wrigleyville, echoed the optimism.\n\"It's first to (win) four,\" said Alex Collar, 27. \"There's six other games.\"\nEven in the eighth, when the Cubs were down 4-2, 27-year old Francesca Saldivar said she expected a 6-4 victory Saturday.\nThat didn't happen. But Cubs fans seemed OK with the end result.\nAfter all, they said, the Cubs lost the first game of the National League Division Series to the archrival St Louis Cardinals.\n\"If we can split in New York,\" said 23-year old Pete Colon, \"we'll be in good shape.\"\nEven before the game began, Cub fever was high in Wrigleyville. Cars could be heard blasting \"Go Cubs Go\" and one man in a \"We Are Good\" shirt walked down Clark chanting \"Let's Go Cubs!\"\nThe team's partisans projected confidence about their team's outlook, with some expressing a particular swagger unusual on the city's North Side.\nCub fan Lauren Riley, 26, and her Metropolitans aficionado boyfriend Mark Dreshaj, 36, were walking outside Wrigley when she made a bold declaration.\n\"We're gonna crush them and he's gonna be like, 'Oh it's fine,'\" said Riley, with a laugh.\nHe took the teasing with good humor and said he holds no ill will toward the Cubs.\n\"I love the Cubs but I gotta go with my home team,\" said Dreshaj, who is from Queens. \"Any other time I'd be wearing a Cubs shirt.\"\nAs they waited in front of a bar, John Tatlock, 22, and Kyle Molskow, 23, said they felt good about the team's chances.\n\"The Cubs are hot and the hottest team wins,\" Molskow said.\nTatlock said this year's squad has \"more momentum\" and works better as a team than the 2008 and 2003 squads that lost in the postseason.\nNear the end of the game, Jimmy Cook, 23, said he's usually pessimistic about the Cubs. Not this year.\n\"It's the vibe, it's the aura,\" Cook said.\ngpratt@tribpub.com\nTwitter @royalpratt\nCopyright Â© 2015, Chicago Tribune Chicago Cubs National League Championship Series New York Mets Jon Lester Dexter Fowler National League Matt Harvey", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5622e129/turbine/ct-wrigleyville-cubs-optimism-20151017"], "published": "2015-10-18T06:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T06:49:08.523+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
