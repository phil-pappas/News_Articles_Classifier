It's a happy accident that it turned into a record,\" he added.\nAs each new song is dissected and reinterpreted, the classic rock sound of guitar, bass and drums is gradually abandoned. Even Smith's distinctive dark voice swings between bass and treble.\nThe arrival of a new vintage is reinforced by the presence of British singer Rachel Goswell, the first guest artist to appear on one of the band's albums. \nThe next test is to recreate the ambience live during a tour that starts in Britain on October 9 before hitting Europe.\n\"It's always a challenge,\" said Leetch of the live shows. \"Sometimes we have to re-amplify certain songs.\"\nArts & Entertainment Media Tom Smith Russell Leetch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:56:44.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
