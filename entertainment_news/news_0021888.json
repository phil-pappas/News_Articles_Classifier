According to the site, Odom was treated at the brothel and then transported by ambulance to the hospital. A plan to airlift Odom to the hospital was reportedly scrapped because of Odom's unusually large frame. \nTMZ alleges that Odom had been partying at the brothel for days and now reports that he is in a coma and breathing with the assistance of a ventilator. The site also reports that Khloe and Kim Kardashian and Kris Jenner are on their way to the hospital to be with Odom. The LA Lakers also expressed concern about Odom on Twitter Tuesday night. \nOdom made regular appearances on the E! series Keeping Up with The Kardashians after he married Khloe Kardashian in 2009 until the couple divorced in 2013. As a professional basketball player, Odom played for the Los Angeles Clippers, the Miami Heat, the Los Angeles Lakers and the Dallas Mavericks. He was let go by the New York Knicks last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T14:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T06:43:20.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
