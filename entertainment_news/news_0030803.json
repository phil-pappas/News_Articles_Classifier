((AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)) Comments \nJournalist and author Tom Brokaw is calling on Americans to follow examples from \"The Greatest Generation,\" and find common ground to answer today's defining challenges, from defeating jihadists in the Middle East to stopping mass murders at schools. \nSpeaking at Faulkner University's annual benefit dinner, the former NBC Nightly News anchor drew on his 1998 book about the generation that rose from the Great Depression to defeat the Axis menace and build an economic superpower. \n\"The greatest generation was formed first by the Great Depression,\" Brokaw said. \"They shared everythingâ€”meals, jobs, clothing. \n\"Experience gave them the will and understanding of how they could work together and face great odds and still prevail.\" \nSpeaking without notes at the Renaissance Convention Center in Montgomery, Brokaw described walking Omaha Beach with D-Day veterans and retold stories that inspired him to research and write \"The Greatest Generation,\" which he called the defining work of his career. \nMany veterans he interviewed were reluctant to talk about combat but quick to remember the buddies who fought at their sides, especially those from different places and backgrounds, he said. \nHe contrasted that spirit with today's divisive political climate, which he described as short on substance and tainted by unprecedented amounts of campaign cash. \nBut his message was less about politics and more about the need for \"big ideas,\" like JFK's call to put a man on the moon and the commitment to nonviolence of civil rights leaders who changed history in Alabama. \nBrokaw talked about spending days and nights with troops who coped with constant danger in Afghanistan. He talked about a fundraiser where this week he met Army Rangers maimed for life from combat. \nIt's tragic, he said, that less than 1 percent of the population carries the burdens and sacrifices of military service. \nHe called on efforts to \"close that gap,\" and praised the launch of a public service academy at Arizona State University, an idea that he said could be duplicated at other land grant universities to help spark the next \"greatest generation.\" \n\"Let's find a way to solve these problems and not make this country less than the some of its parts, because we've always been more than the sum of our parts,\" Brokaw said. \"That's the genius of America.\" \nBrokaw closed his remarks by asking for a moment of reflection on the mass shooting at an Oregon community college today. \nHe said he was a lifelong gun owner but called for an effort to find a way to stop mass killings at places that are supposed to be safe havens. \nFaulkner University is a private, Christian liberal arts university in Montgomery. \nIt operates extension campuses in Birmingham, Huntsville and Mobile, along with several online degree programs. \nPrevious speakers at Faulkner's benefit dinners include Ben Carson, Bill O'Reilly, George W. Bush, Laura Bush and Sarah Palin.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:44:55.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
