Autumn with Topsail will be held Oct. 17 and 18 at the Historical Society of Topsail Island grounds and Assembly building in Topsail Beach. The festival is in its 27th year and features a juried Artists and Crafts Court with over 100 regional artists displaying and selling their work. The vendors are hand-picked, said Keith Myers, event chairman. Each artist will be there to sell his or her own original art, he said. There will also be live entertainment, including performances on Saturday by The Jason Lee McKinney Band from noon until 3 p.m. and North Tower from 5 until 8 p.m. On Sunday, the Band of Oz will play from 1 until 4 p.m. “We have more music this year,” Myers said. Sitting by the stage and listening to the music is his favorite part of the festival, he added. In the last few years, other forms of entertainment have been added to the festival, Myers said. Some of the additions include a roving magician and roving pirates. “They’ll walk around entertaining the kids,” he said. There will also be games and activities for children like face painting, inflatables and jewelry making. There will be 15 different food vendors in the food court area of the festival as well as a beer and wine garden. Last year’s Autumn with Topsail had about 15,000 people attend over two days, he said, but he expects nearly 20,000 this year. “There’s been so many festivals rained out, I think people are really ready for some decent weather,” Myers said. There is plenty of space at the grounds and in the building, he said, so it doesn’t ever feel crowded. It’s a three-plus acre venue situated between the ocean and Topsail Sound, he said. “It’s a beautiful location,” he said, and the weather should be “gorgeous.” In addition to the other activities, there will be a silent auction and a Kiwanis Pancake Breakfast both days. Breakfast is $6 and is served from 7:30 a.m. until 10 a.m. Booths open at 9:30 a.m. Whether you enjoy walking around and shopping, listening to the music or having fun with the kids, there will be plenty to see and do, he said. One-day admission is $5, or it’s $8 for two days. Children under 11 and active military personnel with ID are free. Proceeds benefit the Historical Society of Topsail Island, which uses most of the funds raised to maintain and improve the Assembly Building and the grounds around the building.
