It's unclear if the birth occurred within a 12-mile radius of Alaska, which would make the baby a U.S. citizen by law.\nZen says the baby looked healthy and the mother was happy.\n___\nInformation from: Los Angeles Times, http://www.latimes.com/\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.latimes.com/", "http://abc7ne.ws/1VSsdmw"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:17:35.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
