Another 200 to 300 temporary jobs would be added during peak candy sales seasons, sources said, adding that earthwork has begun on the project.\nThe news about Mars' plans to locate in Joliet came during Thursday's Will County Board meeting as board members discussed an annual contract with the Will County Center for Economic Development. Board member Dan Moran, D-Romeoville, identified Mars and cited the project as one of the CED's recent success stories.\n\"Our investment in the CED is a good investment for Will County,\" Moran said, pointing to Mars as the latest major corporation to locate within the county.\nWithin the last year, Joliet has welcomed corporate giants such as Amazon, IKEA and Cadence Premier Logistics to its industrial parks. The companies are expected to bring hundreds of jobs to the region.\nJoliet City Manager James Hock declined to comment on Moran's remarks. CenterPoint and Mars representatives also did not comment.\n\"It's my understanding that Mars is coming,\" City Councilman John Gerl said. \"If that's true, they're going to be a great addition.\"\n\"I think what it's starting to prove is that Joliet is a place to do business,\" Gerl said of the news of Mars. \"We're really starting to see a lot of activity from a lot of major corporations.\"\nEarlier this month, City Council members approved a five-year, 50 percent property tax rebate for an unnamed company looking to locate at the CenterPoint Intermodal Center. The rebate will amount to about $208,000 per year for five years, according to the city.\nThe development was simply referred to as \"Project Osprey\" in city documents. Sources on Thursday confirmed that \"Project Osprey\" is the Mars distribution center.\nIn the proposal for the tax rebate, county officials said the company proposed a project valued at $132 million with land, buildings and equipment, with a 1.4 million-square-foot warehouse on Cedar Creek Drive in the CenterPoint Intermodal Center. They said then that the \"Osprey Project\" would create up to 700 jobs.\n\"What they (Mars) presented was a win-win for our residents,\" Joliet Councilman Jim McFarland said, noting that jobs at the distribution center would pay above the minimum wage. \"I'm glad they're coming to Joliet, and I welcome them.\"\nSources said the company may seek similar tax rebates from Joliet Township High School District 204 and Laraway Community Consolidated School District 70C.\nAlicia Fabbre is a freelance reporter.\nCopyright Â© 2015, Daily Southtown Joliet", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56205c91/turbine/ct-sta-mars-candy-center-st-1016-20151015"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:55:57.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
