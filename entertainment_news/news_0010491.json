Singer has been defending Cosby in a lawsuit filed by Judy Huth, a Riverside County woman who claims Cosby forced her to perform a sex act on him at the Playboy Mansion around 1974. \nNo reason for the change is stated in the court filing. \nSinger says his firm is also being replaced on a defamation lawsuit filed by model Janice Dickinson against Cosby. \nThe development was first reported Tuesday by the Los Angeles Times.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:04:44.233+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
