Comment Posted Oct. 8, 2015 at 12:01 AM Updated Oct 8, 2015 at 9:59 PM By TV Guide Posted Oct. 8, 2015 at 12:01 AM Updated Oct 8, 2015 at 9:59 PM There's going to be a new sheriff in town on Twin Peaks ! Michael Ontkean has chosen not to reprise his role as Sheriff Harry S Truman on the show, TVLine reported Thursday. A source told the site that Ontkean has retired from acting. He last appeared in The Descendants (2011) as Cousin Milo. Previously, Showtime president David Nevins had guaranteed all the big fan favorites would be returning to the show. New additions to the cast include Amanda Seyfried and Balthazar Getty , who were announced last month. Twin Peaks' log lady Catherine Coulson dies at 71 The reboot has had a bumpy road: They announced it was officially happening nearly a year ago, and then in April, creator David Lynch dramatically dropped out and then very unceremoniously returned. Though the show's airdate has been pushed back to 2017 , it is still definitely happening... just without Ontkean. Will you miss the original Harry, or are you excited for some fresh blood?
