Could the frenzy over “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” be to blame? \nThis year is on pace to be the highest-grossing at the domestic box office in Hollywood history, but Friday was a big-time bummer. Four movies that opened nationwide bombed and a front-runner in the awards races, “ Steve Jobs ,” misfired in a major expansion. \nFor the weekend, Vin Diesel ‘s “The Last Witch Hunter” is on pace to come in under $10 million, Bill Murray ‘s comedy “Rock the Kasbah” will do less than $2 million and “Jem and the Holograms” may not do $1 million. “ Steve Jobs ,” the biopic about the late Apple Inc. founder, sputtered and will do around $7 million, well under the teen-millions distributor Universal had hoped for.

It shattered advance ticket sales records on Monday for distributor Disney. A trailer for the film was dropped at the same time and it broke records, too. \nWith “Star Wars” dominating discussion for moviegoers nationwide ahead of its Dec. 18 debut, were distracted –or pinched– fans the reason the box office took such a hit?

It’s not unusual for advance ticket sales on a hot-selling film to affect the box office the week before it opens, but nearly a month out would be unprecedented. MovieTickets.com and Fandango reported presales more than eight times greater than those for the previous record-holder “The Hunger Games.” \nOther factors, including Halloween parties and what seems like a glut of adult fare may have mattered just as much, and these weren’t well-reviewed films. “Jem and the Holograms” was the highest of the wide openers on Rotten Tomatoes with an anemic 20 percent positive.

That’s because an out-sized hit like that can bring new moviegoers into the market and sets off film buzz that benefits other movies. It also provides a strong platform for the preview trailers that will precede the blockbuster-to-be, and moviegoers will see other marketing materials for new films in theater lobbies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T20:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:58:10.124+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
