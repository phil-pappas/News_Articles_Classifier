Fox has aired a new \"Treehouse of Horror\" every October since 1990 , so more than 100 million Americans have never experienced the month without one. \nOne of the stories in this year's \"Treehouse of Horror\" -- the 26th installment -- will riff on the classic trope of a murderous home invader stalking the family, familiar from horror movies like \"Halloween\" and \"Scream.\" \nIn the preview clip above, Homer, knowing that the stalker could strike at any moment but not wanting to scare Lisa, locks all the windows and doors in the house. It's kinda creepy! The episode airs Oct. 25. \nAlso on HuffPost:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T22:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:04:52.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
