According to BBC News , the American buddy cop action film is the latest addition to the list of flicks being remade for the small screen. \nThe Fox network just recently announced that the movie reboot is a green-light and they have already made a commitment of making a \"put pilot,\" an industry term that means the network has already agreed to air either as a special or series. \nHowever, the TV reboot version is going to be somewhat a different take. The original primary cast, Gibson, who played as Martin Riggs, and Glover, who played as Roger Murtaugh, will no longer be returning to reprise their roles. But it will still follow the same storyline of the movie. \nTexas cop and former Navy SEAL Martin Riggs lost his wife and baby so he moved to Los Angeles to try to start a new life. He then meets his new partner, LAPD detective Roger Murtaugh, whom he immediately clashes with. But as they go along the way busting crimes, the two formed a bond that allowed them to work together as a team. The first film was released in 1987 and after becoming a hit, it went on to generate three sequels over the subsequent 11 years. \nAs reported by Inquisitr , the TV series will be \"written as a crime drama.\" This could mean that it would do away with the sardonic, sharp, action-comedy feel that made the \"Lethal Weapon,\" as well as its subsequent films, such a big hit. As Slate puts it, the \"Lethal Weapon\" show will possibly be a \" drab police procedural that bears only superficial resemblance to its namesake.\" Interested viewers can only hope that it doesn't go that way. \nFormer \"Forever\" and \"Chuck\" creator Matt Miller has been reported to be the one to adapt the movie franchise for the small screen. Dan Lin and Jennifer Gwartz will be executive producing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T22:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:40:50.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
