By the mid-'80s, personal computers were starting to take hold. Remember those old TV ads with a guy playing Charlie Chaplin that were omnipresent in that era? Those were for IBM computers. \nIn other words, being the “sole distributor, Midwest Region” for a new series of IBM electric typewriters in 1979 isn't going to be quite the gold mine that these unfortunate dudes think it is. They're on the wrong side of history, even though they don't know it. Watch the official trailer for 'Fargo' season 2 \nBut their desire to push through this business deal – one of them is looking for money, the other is looking for respect and independence – sets in motion a deadly series of events in the second season of the Alberta-shot Fargo, which debuts Monday, Oct. 12, on FX (in both Canada and the U.S.). \nFargo is an anthology series that resets and tells a different story every season. It's inspired by the Academy Award-winning movie of the same name, but it isn't a remake of the film, or a prequel to the film, or a sequel to the film. \nTechnically, though, season two of Fargo is a prequel to season one, which starred Billy Bob Thornton, Martin Freeman, Colin Hanks and Allison Tolman. \nThroughout the first season of Fargo, which largely was set in 2006, there were vague references to something big and bad that had happened in 1979. Well, Season 2 goes back to '79 and tells that tale. \nThere is one obvious character link between the the two seasons. In Season 1, Lou Solverson was played by Keith Carradine. Remember, Lou was the ex-cop who owned the diner, and he was the dad of Deputy Molly Solverson, played by Tolman. \nIn Season 2, a much younger Lou Solverson – still a Minnesota State Trooper at this point in his life, played by Patrick Wilson – is one of the main characters. Molly is only six years old, and her mom/Lou's wife Betsy is played by Cristin Milioti. Watch a clip from season 2 of 'Fargo' \n\"You watch the first three episodes of year one, and you thought, 'Well, it's actually not connected to the movie at all,' and then in the fourth (episode) you realize that it was connected to the movie on some level,\" Fargo showrunner/executive producer Noah Hawley explained. \"This second year is sort of very literally connected to the first year. \n\"So I feel like there will always be some connect (if there are future seasons of Fargo), but it doesn't necessarily have to be pivotal. It can be tangential, but that's as far as I've really thought about it. \n\"The first season was set in 2006, it was boom time America, and it was a story about a peaceful place into which some villainy arrived that they weren't prepared to deal with. This year is very different. It's about, you know, (in 1979) even small-town America was in the throes of the recession and the crime wave and everything.\" \nSeason 2 of Fargo, to use Hawley's own term, is a “horse-race story,” figuratively speaking. \nHorse No. 1 is the police, featuring the aforementioned Lou Solverson as well as Sheriff Hank Larsson, played by Ted Danson. Hank, by the way, is Betsy's father. \nHorse No. 2 is the local Gerhardt crime family, which is in the midst of an internal power struggle. Matriarch Floyd Gerhardt is played by a virtually unrecognizable Jean Smart, and youngest son Rye is played by Kieran Culkin. \nHorse No. 3 is the Kansas City mafia, which wants to absorb the Gerhardts' operation, either by business arrangement, or, if necessary, by force. They'd prefer the former, but they have no issue with the latter. \nAll three of those horses are chasing crucial information. Specifically, they need to know the whereabouts of a certain individual. There are great advantages to winning that race. \nAnd secretly caught in the middle of it all, through a truly kooky set of circumstances, is a young couple in Luverne, Minn., named Peggy and Ed Blomquist, played by Kirsten Dunst and Jesse Plemons. Watch a teaser from 'Fargo' season 2 \n\"There are a lot of moving pieces,\" Hawley said. \"You have this small-town couple who find themselves caught in this war between the Kansas City Mafia and the Gerhardt family, and obviously they're both crime syndicates where violence is a real factor. \n\"We're setting up this dynamic where there are a lot of bad people sort of on a collision course, and the idea is, who will emerge? And will Ed and Peggy survive?\" \nIn particular, Dunst's Peggy has a personality that really has to be experienced to be believed. Peggy emerges quickly in the second season of Fargo as perhaps the most complex and bizarre person in a world where quirkiness hardly is a unique trait. \n\"Peggy is legendary,\" Dunst said succinctly. \n\"Peggy has set goals for herself and nothing is going to stop her. And I don't think it's about being (either) smart or oblivious. I don't want to call her a little delusional, but she has such a zeroed-in path of what she wants to do and what she wants to be. And then there is this other part that's stopping her, that she does come from a small town, and she could live that life and just have kids. \n\"And then this wrench is thrown into the middle of this. I think it wakes her up to, you know, the possibility of not fulfilling any of those things.\" \nVisually speaking, perhaps more than any other character, Peggy's look goes a long way toward setting the scene in Fargo. \n\"When I read the first few episodes, I was thinking, 'I want people to giggle a little bit to themselves when they see Peggy,' \" Dunst said. Meet the cast of 'Fargo' season 2 \n\"Because with the arc of what I'm about to go on, I want people to be on Peggy's side in a way. And I knew that certain things — like wearing little white earmuffs when I'm doing something that is not necessarily right — would help balance out and give a sense of humour to what Peggy was doing.\" \nOf course, that's the thing about Fargo. It has a tone that careens wildly between fabulously funny, and soothingly sentimental, and startlingly serious, and viciously violent. \nAnd yet the lines stay straight. Nothing comes out crooked. Despite all those different fonts, Fargo hums along as efficiently as a self-correcting, IBM Selectric 2 electric typewriter, with patented high-speed type-ball. \nJust to be clear, though, you can't watch Fargo on a typewriter, no matter how futuristic it is.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T20:15:14.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
