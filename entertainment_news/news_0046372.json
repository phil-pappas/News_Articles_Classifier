Uncomfortably close, in some cases.\nThese remains are called collectively the “bog bodies,” and Welsh archaeology professor Miranda Aldhouse-Green selects a handful of well-researched bodies to introduce in her book “Bog Bodies Uncovered: Solving Europe’s Ancient Mystery.” These are people we now know a lot about thanks to the intriguing “CSI”- like technology that has brought their lives into the light of the modern day.\nThe term “bog bodies” refers to the whole, well-preserved corpses that have been found in the watery peat bogs of northern Europe. Some of them were young adults; some adolescents. Most had a disability. All met horrible deaths between 500 B.C. and 200 A.D. And all look very nearly like the day they met their end. No oxygen can penetrate the bog, which halts decomposition. That, plus a chemical found in the moss peculiar to these bogs, keeps skin, hair, teeth and clothing intact.\n The bodies are named after the places where they were found, but science has helped us know these people intimately. Intact guts mean we know what they ate — in one case, mistletoe, in another, a probably-not-tasty griddle cake. We know their hair styles and color, because it is still on their heads.\nOne of the most famous bog victims, called Tollund Man, still has stubble on his cheeks. His eyes are closed, as if sleeping. He looks like a peaceful figure, until the viewer notes the noose around his neck.\nStill not known: why these people were murdered. Aldhouse-Green offers some theories, but since they aren’t concrete, they pale next to the fascinating glimpse into Neolithic times that science has given us.\nBonus for fans of fictional mysteries: Crime novelist Val McDermid wrote the book’s foreword, explaining her interest in the bog bodies. “All we can do is interrogate what is left,” she says of scientific inquiry.\nMelissa Davis : 206-464-2506 or mdavis@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @Melissa_Dav .", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/Melissa_Dav"], "published": "2015-10-04T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T17:55:59.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
