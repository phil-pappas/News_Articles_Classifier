Geena Davis (Joel Ryan/Invision) \n“If the female characters are one-dimensional, sidelined, hyper-sexualised or simply not there at all, we’re saying women and girls are less important than men and boys. \n“We’re teaching kids that women do not take up half the space in the world. And the message is sinking in. \n“It’s a powerful negative message that we are showing to kids.

We are unwittingly training generation after generation that women are unequal.” Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:51:45.422+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
