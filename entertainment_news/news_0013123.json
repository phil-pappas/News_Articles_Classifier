We lived together. I went skinny-dipping with him - also, by the way, with Greta Garbo!\" \nJane also revealed that Katherine Hepburn, who starred as Jane's mother in the movie, was initially unhappy at Michael's presence on set. \nShe said: \"When I first asked her permission, she was not happy. But then the crew said, 'You don't understand, it's Michael Jackson.' She was very prickly. I mean, she was a snob, she was very moody, she was very judgmental.\" \nHowever, Katherine, who passed away in 2003, soon accepted Michael and even offered him career advice. \nJane said: \"Michael wanted to be a movie star. He had just finished doing 'The Wiz', and he had a tape recorder with him, and every day I would bring him to the set, and in between scenes she would sit down in a chair and pull over a chair for him and tell him stories. And every story embedded a lesson.\" bang showbiz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:41:54.767+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
