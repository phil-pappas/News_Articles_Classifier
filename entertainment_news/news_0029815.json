As the eldest statesman, bass player Billy Ray has laid down the bottom end for the Piners and the late, great Eddie Kirkland. On the other end of the age spectrum is lead guitarist Jimmy Jay, who was riding shotgun with Kirkland at age 12. Grammy-nominated international touring and recording artist J.D. Jukejoint plays the drums, and occasionally the guit-fiddle, providing the backbone of Memphis Lightning. \nUpcoming in the weekly series are: Nov. 2, Bobby Messano ($10); Nov. 9, Slam Allen Band ($10); Nov. 16, Roberto Morbioli ($10); and Nov. 23, John Primer ($15).
