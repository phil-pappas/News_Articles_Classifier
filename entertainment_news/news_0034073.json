But warm weather is fleeting here, and so are those good habits that keep us fit. How can we avoid packing on the pounds? Here are seven tips on how to make colder weather work for you, courtesy of Brian Hahn, senior director of health and wellness at Carlson MetroCenter YMCA.\nChoose healthy seasonal foods such as pumpkin, cabbage and butternut squash. Be mindful when you're eating heavier foods. Practice good portion control when consuming heartier, high-caloric meals like chili and stews. Move your activity indoors: Walk the mall, indoor tracks or try water-based fitness classes. Make it a point to warm up your body and get the blood flowing by staying active. Set small and large goals. The goal of working out doesn't have to be weight loss. It could be for stress relief, to increase energy, improve flexibility or reduce strain. Pair your workout with enticing, healthy meal choices to create a winning recipe for success. Work out with a buddy: You'll be more motivated and hold one another accountable. Try small-group personal training. Led by a certified personal trainer, it allows you to participate in physical activity with a handful of people who have similar goals and needs. The small-group setting fosters authentic, motivational relationships and provides more individual attention. This ensures correct form and movement, so you maximize your workout while avoiding injury. Use a functional training center. Functional training combines a series of movements to improve daily activity patterns. The Carlson MetroCenter YMCA has a center designed to create a series of small-group options to help participants improve their daily active living, whether at work or play. \"If you can't make a class, there are drop-in times available for you to use the Functional Training Center,\" says Hahn, \"and a certified trainer is always present.\" A key benefit to staying fit in the winter, adds Hahn, is that when warm weather returns, you won't be stressed about getting in shape — you'll already be there.\n.
