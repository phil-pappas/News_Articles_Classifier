Jonathan Dorfman of the suburban Detroit Dorfman Chapel confirmed the death and says his business is arranging the funeral. \nThe Detroit Free Press reports that Abrams was the first employee of Motown founder Berry Gordy Jr. — before the company officially existed. Abrams promoted records to Detroit disc jockeys and went on to direct media relations at the label that included Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and the Supremes. \nAbrams left Motown in 1967 to launch a public relations firm with clients such as Stax Records and James Brown. \nHe also was a journalist and author and co-wrote a musical, “Memories of Motown.” Join the conversation Sign in to comment (not connected to your Insider Club login).
