The network has ordered two new seasons, a seventh and an eighth, of the beloved animated comedy from 20th Century Fox Television. The show just premiered its sixth season on Sunday, October 5. \"Six seasons in, the Belchers have become one of America's most beloved TV families, and we are so happy to keep them in the fold for another two seasons,\" said Fox Broadcasting Co. Entertainment president David Madden when announcing the renewal on Wednesday. \" 'Bob's Burgers' is hilarious, warm, smart, inventive - critics love it, and so do fans. Loren, [executive producer] Jim [Dauterive] and the brilliant voice cast continue to surprise us in the best ways, and we look forward to seeing what Bob and the family will cook up in seasons seven and eight.\" The Emmy-winning animated series will air its 100th episode in spring 2016. \"In a way your 100th episode should be almost like your pilot all over again,\" said series creator Loren Bouchard of preparing the 100th episode, \"I think a good 100th episode shouldn't be big and crazy. It should be the quintessential 'Bob's Burgers' episode.\" \"Bob's Burgers\" airs Sundays at 7:30 P.M. on FOX. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T09:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:35:24.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
