But there is something more to the film that is revealed in the photos of Ravi Shankar that have emerged. Ravi Shankar's photos in the getup of a rakshasa is in stark contrast to the stylish and suave presence of Anant Nag which was the only look of the film made public so far.\nDirector Viji said, \"This is just one of the five getups for Ravi Shankar in the film. He will be seen in four different roles. This particular role of a Rakshasa is not taken from an mythology. It has emerged from imagination. We have named it Rankasura. There is no such rakshasa mentioned in any mythology. He is a brand new rakshasa making his debut in our film.\" Asked what is the job of a rakshasa in a sci-fi, Viji said, \"I do not want to categorise my film in to a genre. Yes, it talks about the possible effect of a scientific discovery on society. But there is much more to the film. Ravi Shankar's character was not revealed because it is unique and we did not want to create confusion because of the contrast it has with the the rest of the film.\"\nThe costume for Rankasura is done by Pallavi, who happens to be the wife of director Duniya Suri. Viji cut his teeth working under Suri before turning independent director with Dyavre. \"She is a designer and she came up with something unique. We will release the making video of the character on Monday evening. The role is also something unique for Ravi Shankar,\" Viji said.\nRavi Shankar has completed acting in 50 Kannada films in less than four years since he made a huge impact in the villain's role in Kempegowda. The roles he has done so far is mostly that of the antagonist but with varying shades, from menacing to the comical. But this is his first in the role of a created mythological character. He has however dubbed for and acted in such fantasy roles in Telugu.", "external_links": ["http://www.speakingtree.in/topics/people/ravi-shankar"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:10:10.519+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
