I feel like I can't step outside and feel like I can go outside naked. \n“You should feel comfortable in your own space… especially that far away.\" \nFortunately, it seems he has since been able to see the funny side, joking: “That was shrinkage for me.” \nThe nude photos caused a social media storm when they were first shared online, with some taking the opportunity to make jokes about the paparazzi shots, while others leapt to The Biebs’ defence, insisting the photos weren’t a laughing matter, but were actually “a gross invasion of privacy” . \nJustin is currently gearing up for the release of his latest album, ‘Purpose’, which goes on sale next month. \nThe lead single, ‘What Do You Mean?’ has already earned the controversial Canadian star his first ever UK number one single, though time will tell whether the album can follow suit, as he’s about to enter a chart battle with fellow teen sensations, One Direction .
