It gets attention anywhere it goes -- and that, Coccia said, is the fun of owning the distinctive bike. \nIt's a four-wheeler. Riders sit side by side on a red and white checkered upholstered seat, under a lace-fringed roof to keep the sun off them. \nCoccia has this uniquely designed bicycle ready for Ellwood City's annual Halloween Pumpkin Patch Parade on Saturday, where it will get attention not only because of the way it looks but how it sounds. A battery pack powers headlights and taillights, two horns and a music system that plays about 40 tunes, including Christmas music and \"Happy Birthday.\" \nThere is a padded steering wheel, and Coccia said it is hard to steer and must take wide turns. It is also hard to pedal uphill. Coccia's daughter, Kylie, and someone not yet chosen will be pedaling the bike in the parade. Kylie has not decided what costume she will wear, but she will not wear a mask. \nIt isn't the first time the bike has been in the Halloween parade. More than 25 years ago, Coccia, dressed as a clown, and his wife, Shirley, dressed as a jester, had a lot of fun pedaling it in the parade. \nAfter that event, the bike fell upon hard times. \nIn the 1980s, Coccia took it to the family camp at Kittanning, where it was pedaled around a level area. But when the seat broke, he brought it home and put it in the garage -- where it stayed for 20 years. \n\"It was just stored there, and I piled wood on it and forgot about it,\" Coccia said. \"About a month ago, I got it out and decided to fix it up. The tires were flat and it was in bad shape.\" \nHe stripped it down to the frame, painted and refurbished it, made a new and better padded seat, and dressed up the roof with lace fringe. He added the wiring for lights and music -- and the bicycle got a new modern life. \nIn the 1970s, Coccia first saw the bicycle when he was delivering mail in Franklin Township. The bicycle is made of two different styles of girl's bikes welded to a frame. It was created by Harry Boyer, and after his death, Coccia bought the bike from Boyer's wife, Allys, for $75. Coccia has added all the modern touches. \n\"It is just fun to have because everyone looks at it,\" Coccia said. \"We plan to take it through McDonald's drive-through some evening just for fun.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:04:15.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
