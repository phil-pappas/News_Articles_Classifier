Abhaychandra Jain gets more security after threat call By Indo-Asian News Service on October 26, 2015 at 12:17 AM Comments \nSecurity had been stepped up for Karnataka Sports and Fisheries Minister K. Abhaychandra Jain a day after he received a threat to his life from a person claiming to be a gangster, police said on Sunday. ”We have deployed additional personnel at Jain’s residence and office besides providing more security men after he filed a complaint about the threat call on his mobile phone on Saturday,” Mangaluru Police Commissioner S. Murugan told IANS. \nAccusing Jain of being involved in the murder of Bajrang Dal activist Prashant Poojary at Moodbidri on October 9, the ‘gangster’ had threatened him with dire consequences. He also told Jain that as Forests and Environment Minister Ramanath Rai was also involved in the murder, he too would not be spared. \nJain also briefed Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Home Minister K.J. George about the threat call and sought more protection. Murugan said that an FIR had been lodged on the basis of the minister’s complaint and investigations are on. “We are going his call records to find from where and which number the accused had called and verifying its voice content. \n“Since we have arrested nine people in connection with Poojary’s murder so far, we will also interrogate them to ascertain if they know the caller and track him down as we are monitoring calls being made among the suspects,” he said. \nPoojary, a flower vendor, was hacked to death by six motorbike-borne men on October 9 for seizing a goods vehicle transporting cows to an illegal slaughter house in the town. ”Though the situation in the city and town is normal, we are maintaining strict vigil and monitoring of people and vehicles to ensure law and order,” Murugan added. \n  26, 2015 12:20 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T20:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T23:52:10.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
