He himself took the initiative and asked the production house to let him sing the song.\n\"Singing isn't an easy thing to do. There's a lot that goes into it. However, I did make sure my effort didn't go into vain and I sang from my heart,” Anas said in a statement.\nCurrently, 'Diya Aur Baati Hum' is gearing up for a rather power-packed climax with Mission Mahaabali now reaching its point of execution.\nAnas, who shares the screen space with Deepika Singh as the female lead, notes that the track fits the sequence well.\n\"The title track is very touching and is exactly what Sooraj is going through on the show. The whole sequence fits the bill completely,\" he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:06:03.382+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
