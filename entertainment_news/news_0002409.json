The damage is estimated at $30,000. \nAn attorney for the city has said three of the nine damaged properties are city-owned. \nFairey's lawyer has said prosecutors offered no proof the tagging was done by Fairey. \nThe artist was in Detroit in May to complete a 184-foot-tall mural on a downtown building. The work was financed by businessman Dan Gilbert's Bedrock Real Estate Services, which owns the building.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:26:40.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
