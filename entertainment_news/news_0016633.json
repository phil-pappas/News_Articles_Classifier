Vin Diesel's \"The Last Witch Hunter\" also tanked with $10.8 million. \nBut, while poor reviews might have sunk \"Jem\" and \"Kasbah,\" good reviews couldn't save \"Steve Jobs\" either. After two very strong limited-release weekends, the biopic failed to impress in wide release with $7.3 million. \nThe weekend of duds left room for holdovers to take the top spots. In second place, \"Goosebumps\" earned $15.5 million, while \"The Martian\" reclaimed its throne in weekend four with $15.9 million.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T21:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:04:17.368+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
