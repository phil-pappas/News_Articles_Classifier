Although several posts included candid shots of Malia, none showed her actually taking part in the drinking game.\n\"Some of the tweets include photographs of her that were clearly taken when she was not looking. Many of them mention her presence at a party, where she was seen taking shots and playing beer pong,\" the Oct. 20 edition of The Brown Daily Herald said under the headline, \"Sorry, Malia Obama.\"\n\"The motivation to take these pictures was obvious: being at a party with the president's daughter was an exciting, unexpected moment that many of us wanted to share with our friends,\" the editorial continued. \"We often do not think about our tweets and Snapchats reaching anyone besides our friends and followers, and certainly not news outlets with wide circulation like Buzzfeed. Many Brown students were surprised and embarrassed to see themselves cited in the articles, as other Brown students posted them on Facebook with disappointed captions that criticized their peers for not simply leaving the 17-year-old alone on her college visit.\"\nMalia is the elder of President Barack Obama 's two daughters with first lady Michelle Obama .\n  Malia Obama seen near possible beer pong game Harrison Ford drops in on couple's wedding via helicopter Andrew Keegan and Arista Ilona are expecting their first child Hollywood makeup artist Jake Bailey dead of apparent suicide", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T16:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:33:27.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
