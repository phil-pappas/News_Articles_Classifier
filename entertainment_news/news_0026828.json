He was then subdued, cuffed and taken to Travis County Jail. The police warned him to stop but he disobeyed. \nThe arrest took place within Austin’s entertainment district along 6th Street, where the Austin City Limits Music Festival, which the actor is in town for, is now under way through the weekend. Another witness told TMZ that prior to the arrest, LaBeouf and another woman were denied entry into another bar nearby due to their apparent drunkenness. \nActor Shia LaBeouf has found himself in more trouble with the law. Shia LaBeouf was arrested in Austin, Texas for public intoxication. \nFor refusing to leave a theatrical performance when asked, for creating unreasonable noise and using obscene language outside of Studio 54, and for spitting at a police officer at the Midtown North police precinct. \nHe was ordered to go to substance-abuse treatment, and as part of his plea deal, LaBeouf’s case would be dismissed and sealed if he’d displayed good behavior for six months. \nAs of press time, several outlets are still awaiting comment from representatives of the 29-year-old actor. \nLaBeouf, 29, was arrested on the misdemeanor charge at 7:33 p.m. Friday, the Austin Police Department said in a news release. \nLast year, the actor was arrested after smoking a cigarette and being disruptive in the audience of the Broadway revival of “Cabaret“.
