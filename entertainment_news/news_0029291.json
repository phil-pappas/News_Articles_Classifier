Image 54 of 54 Art is child’s play at Yanaguana Garden 1 / 54 Back to Gallery At Hemisfair’s Yanaguana Garden, visitors not only will be able to touch the art, they can climb in and on it, too.\nOpening this weekend, the 4.1 acre park is the first phase of the redevelopment of the former HemisFair Park. Described as a play environment for all ages, Yanaguana Garden features “PLAY,” a kid-friendly collection of interactive artworks by San Antonio-based artists Stuart Allen , Justin Boyd , Joey Fauerso, Jennifer Khoshbin and Alex Rubio .\nAllen led the team charged with creating the touchable, multipurpose pieces. He designed a galvanized steel table with kite-making instructions etched on the surface for the project.\n“If you’re standing right in the middle of the park you can almost see all of them from one particular vantage point,” Allen said.“They’re on average 100 to 150 feet apart from each other, but they’re scattered throughout. We always kind of envisioned this thing as being an art scavenger hunt.”\nThe three-day opening weekend celebration begins with a family friendly First Friday with music, food and drinks available for purchase. Food trucks also will be on site. The official ribbon cutting is 10 a.m. Saturday, and the six artists who created the works in “PLAY” will be on site Sunday to lead kids in art activities throughout the day.\nIn addition to Allen’s “Kite Table,” the other works in “PLAY” are “Sky Camp,” a campsite with four pup tents by Fauerso; “Sideshow,” a small-scale theater stage with three backdrops by Khoshbin; “House,” a playhouse with perforated walls by Mahaffy; “Yanaguana,” an abstract mural by Alex Rubio; and a sound installation by Boyd called “Why Do Birds Sound Like Car Alarms Now?”\nPublic Art San Antonio, a division of the city’s Department for Culture and Creative Development, oversaw the $300,000 project.\n“It’s really a well programmed space from an art perspective,” said Jimmy LeFlore , public art manager. “Each of the artworks has its own personality, but it all conveys the same group concept of play.”\n“I think that the craftsmanship is impeccable,” LeFlore added. “That was one of the things that we were trying to set the right tone for Hemisfair artwork, because we want to build faith and trust as we complete the rest of the art master plan in future phases that it’s going to be as world class as people have always said it will be.”", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/12/24/8692999/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/12/26/8693177/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg",
