The J.J. Abrams-directed picture obliterated the \"Games\" mark by more than eight times and traffic on Fandango's site surged to seven times above its peak level in less than 24 hours. \nLucasfilm said the fervor for tickets was worldwide. It reported that in the United Kingdom, more than 200,000 tickets were purchased on day one. Fans in Norway reportedly went out in sub-zero temperatures to get early tickets. Even with the record-setting sales, the company said tickets remain available for the opening weekend, following the Dec. 18 debut.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:29:56.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
