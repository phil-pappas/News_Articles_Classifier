Comment Posted Oct. 13, 2015 at 7:05 PM By Stan Sulewski Posted Oct. 13, 2015 at 7:05 PM PORTLAND Students and staff from Portland Public Schools are taking a few pages out of a popular TV show for their next fundraising event. The event, dubbed “Rockin’ with the Raiders” is a hometown take on the popular reality television show Dancing with the Stars. According to Sherri Gensterblum, organizer of the event and member of the Portland Athletic Association, the event came from wanting to do something out of the ordinary. “It will be similar to Dancing with the Stars,” Gensterblum said. “We wanted to do something different for a fundraiser.” Gensterblum is organizing the event with fellow Portland Athletic Association member, Tammy Pettit. The dancing competition will be held Sunday, Oct. 18 at the Portland High School auditorium, which is located at 1100 Ionia Road in Portland. Tickets for the event are on sale now. General admission tickets are $5 per seat and can be purchased at Portland City Hall between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. A limited amount of VIP reserved seating tickets will also be sold, which are $10 per seat. If the event is not sold out, tickets will be available at the door on the night of the show. While performances will start at approximately 5:30 p.m., visitors can come by the school at 4:30 p.m. for a fried chicken dinner before the show. For $6, individuals will receive fried chicken, baked beans, coleslaw, and a roll. The dinner will last until approximately 5:30 p.m. According to Gensterblum, 100 percent of the proceeds will go back into the Portland Athletic Association. The competition will be comprised of five teams; two of which will be made-up from teachers and coaches, and the remaining three made up from students. Costumes have been donated by the Portland Civic Players, and everything else has been done on a volunteer basis. The teams are coach Chris Roof and band director and teacher Christine Prater; teacher Chandra Polasek and counselor Rob Beckett; junior Cole McGregor and Senior Megan Kapcia, seniors Aubrey Gross and Kyler Simon; and sophomore Lauren Russell and junior Griffin Hager. During the first round, the dancers will perform a salsa dance, which was choreographed by Cecilia and Lamar Powell out of Detroit. “They actually teach salsa dancing,” Gensterblum said. “(Cecilia) is a Portland native, so someone in our committee contacted her and asked her to help. She made trips down here to rehearsals and taught them how to salsa.” After the first round, the panel of teacher judges will cast their votes for two groups to move on to the second round. A third group will be voted to move on by the audience, who will have the opportunity to vote during the intermission for $1.

Jerika Kihn, a student in Portland, helped each team choreograph their dance based upon the song they chose. Gensterblum said that the two teams who did not move on to the second round will have an opportunity to perform their routine before the remaining three teams resume competition. While the judges are deliberating during the second intermission, Gensterblum said an Irish dance will be performed on stage. From there, the judges will announce a first, second, and third place winner, who will receive various gift cards as a prize. Gensterblum said that so far, the organization has raised over $1,000 from ticket sales; and she commends the community for its generosity. “When we dreamed this up back in March, I had no idea it would go to this extent,” Gensterblum said. “I just love our community. We’re so fortunate.” For more information about the competition, visit www.rockinwiththeraiders.wix.com or visit the Portland Athletic Association Facebook page.
