Daniel Craig as James Bond in Spectre . \nElba has rubbished the rumours, and in a new interview with the UK's  Mirror , Craig's Spectre co-star Dave Bautista said he expected the first blonde-haired Bond still has a few movies left in him.\nAdvertisement \"Everybody is talking about who the next Bond will be but Daniel hasn't said he is quitting the role yet,\" Bautista, who will play assassin Mr Hinx, said.\n\"From the conversations we had on the set of Spectre I think he will do at least one more.\nDaniel Craig in 2012's Skyfall . \n\"I say at least because the conversations I had with him are not the conversations of a man who is ready to say goodbye to the role.\"\nCraig, who made his debut in 2008's Quantum of Solace , is still a long way from being the longest serving James Bond - a record held by Roger Moore who played the spy a staggering seven times.\nMoore was also 57 when he filmed his final movie A View to a Kill , giving Craig, 47, plenty of time to create a new record.\nIdris Elba as detective John Luther on BBC drama Luther, which saw him win a Golden Globe for best actor. Photo: ABC \nCraig is also the most lucrative James Bond to date, with 2012's Skyfall breaking UK box office records to take $US304 million at home and another $US800 million abroad.\nSkyfall 's director Sam Mendes and Craig have reunited for  Spectre , which lands in Australian cinemas on November 22.\nThe film's third and final trailer has been released and finally shows Bond coming face to face with Spectre 's villainous leader played by Austrian actor Christoph Waltz.\nLike Skyfall , Spectre looks heavy on doom and gloom and shows the spy meeting his toughest opponents yet.\n\"Look around you James. Everything you believed in, a ruin,\" a foreboding Waltz says in the one-minute clip.\nThe series does appear to be slowly modernising insofar as Spectre 's leading lady will be played by 50-year-old actress Monica Bellucci, the most age-appropriate mate for the spy since the series began.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T05:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T06:20:21.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
