Consider this edited version a public scary announcement.\n1. Ash Williams, the unlikely hero of the \"Evil Dead\" films, has been plagued by demonic spirits ever since an ill-fated trip to a cabin in the woods with friends. The group unknowingly releases demons by reading from the Necronomicon Ex Mortis.\n2. The Necronomicon Ex Mortis or Book of the Dead is bound in human flesh and inked in blood, and under no circumstances should passages be read aloud. That releases Evil Dead, or spirits who become Deadites.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\n'Evil Dead' lives! How fans kept cult hit alive\n3. A Deadite is a life-force, person, animal or even inanimate object that is possessed by a Kandarian Demon. They are cunning and manipulative and can only be killed by bodily dismemberment.\n4. Ash Williams has a unique and surprising knack for killing Deadites. He has lost loved ones and a hand (but gained a chainsaw-hand) in the process.\n5. The first \"Evil Dead\" movie eventually became an international success and is one of the best-known horror movies ever. It was made by metro Detroit friends Sam Raimi, Rob Tapert and Campbell, who all are involved with \"Ash vs. Evil Dead.\"\nContact Detroit Free Press writer Julie Hinds: 313-222-6427 or jhinds@freepress.com.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7e65a796c84346559cbf255c628b3b46756948d7/c=0-300-2400-2700/local/-/media/2015/10/22/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635811322858176148-Bruce-Campbell-as-Ash-.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/72801d831f84b992f8da6153358b2a6420edcc03/c=215-0-1815-1600/local/-/media/2015/10/23/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635812074513260880-102215-evil-dead-rg-06.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-25T06:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:30:50.730+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
