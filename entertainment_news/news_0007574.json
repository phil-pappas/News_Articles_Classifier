But “Numbskulls” wouldn’t make for a very marketable title, and marketability is what “Goosebumps” is all about. Like most lazily made kids pictures, the filmmakers operate on the assumption that children will sit through anything as long as the screen is filled with multicolored busyness. So why bother with conjuring any sort of story or character development? And why write intelligent dialogue if rote pop-culture references will do? Just stick in a couple references to Instagram and twerking and voila! Also be sure to get a couple of blah teen actors willing to work on the cheap, like say Dylan Minnette and Odeya Rush, and you’re good to go. And that would be fine – abhorrent, but fine – if “Goosebumps” were just another throwaway entertainment. But this one is based on the beloved books of R.L. Stine, the Stephen King of the under-12 set. He deserves much more than the cacophonous trainwreck director Rob Letterman affords him. Instead of focusing on one of the prolific author’s stories, an insane asylum of hack writers have decided to throw Stine’s entire collection of goblins and monsters at you all at once, making for a manic, confusing mess. They then try to disguise their slothfulness behind a slew of message-sending platitudes and faint examinations of loneliness and rejection. If this is sounding bad on paper, it’s even worse in execution. In fact, a lethal injection would be preferable to the cruel and unusual punishment “Goosebumps” dishes out. About all you can do to endure it is by trying to think of other things, like tallying how many other movies Letterman and company ripoff. I counted about 30, everything from “Ghostbusters” and “Gremlins” to “Inside Out” and “Splash.” In other words, originality ain’t this film’s strongsuit. Annoyance is, and it exceeds beyond comprehension. It begins on a slightly tolerable note, only because we’re in the company of the marvelous Amy Ryan, slumming as a widowed educator and mom moving her son, Zach (Minnette), and herself from New York City to tiny Madison, Del. Like the little girl in “Inside Out,” Zach hates his new environment – until he meets Hannah (Rush), the mysterious girl next door. Page 2 of 2 - Her father (Jack Black, irritating per usual) has rendered her a virtual prisoner, refusing to let her go outside, not even to school. The reason for this, which comes literally to light late in the movie, is extremely creepy, especially for a kids movies. But I digress. As does the movie – often. To make a dumb story short, just know that Black’s character is actually a fictionalized version of Stine who keeps his menagerie of ghouls locked away inside his dozens of manuscripts. Zach, natch, accidentally unleashes them on his unsuspecting new hometown, causing much chaos, but strangely no discernable danger. The goal is for Zach, Stine, Hannah and Zach’s new nerdy pal, Champ (Ryan Scott Lee channeling “Superbad’s” McLovin), to roundup all the monsters and lock them back in their books. What ensues is busy but dull. And Letterman (making his second collaboration with Black after “Gulliver’s Travels”) never provides a reason to care, even when the story takes a maudlin turn into the sadness that fills Stine’s lonely existence. Worse, it wastes Amy Ryan in a nothing part. Why is she even here? More to the point, Why does this idiotic movie exist? MONEY – that’s why. And Hollywood is betting you’re gullible enough to spend yours on it. But don’t be fooled. The only goose you’ll get from “Goosebumps” is to the one between the folds of your wallet. “Goosebumps” is rated PG. Running time: 103 minutes.
