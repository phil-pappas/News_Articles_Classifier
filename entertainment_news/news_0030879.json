In addition, the couple has settled on joint custody of their three sons - Kingston, 9; Zuma, 7; and Apollo, 1 -- but Rossdale will actually be taking care of the children most of the time due to Stefani's touring schedule.\nBush frontman Rossdale and No Doubt lead singer Stefani were married in 2002 and Stefani filed for divorce earlier this year, citing irreconcilable differences. Their split is expected to be finalized by the end of the year.\nOther Links From TVGuide.com\nGwen Stefani Gavin Rossdale\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/gwen-stefani/196480/?rss=breakingnews&partnerid=worldnow&profileid=01", "http://www.tmz.com/2015/10/25/gwen-stefani-gavin-rossdale-settle-divorce/", "http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/gavin-rossdale/237415/?rss=breakingnews&partnerid=worldnow&profileid=01", "http://www.tvguide.com/news/gwen-stefani-gavin-rossdale-divorce-terms/?rss=breakingnews&partnerid=worldnow&profileid=01", "http://www.tvguide.com/news/gwen-stefani-and-gavin-rossdale-are-divorcing/?rss=breakingnews&partnerid=worldnow&profileid=01", "http://images.worldnow.com/TVGuide/images/220128_G.gif"], "published": "2015-10-26T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:38:04.488+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
