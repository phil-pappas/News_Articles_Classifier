It's in the same font that I have tattooed to my hand.The second is a large solitaire ring, gifted by him, which I wear, often. He would joke that the man I wanted to marry had to beat this ring.These apart, I will happily get rid of my old, worn jeans that are out of fashion now... And the ripped Tees which were once a fad!\nTAAPSEE PANNU: COAT UNCOAT\nI have treasured a long, white, oversized coat since my college years. I've moved from Delhi to Mumbai and back over a dozen times, but strangely, I never remember to bring it with me. I don't remember to take it out during Delhi winters and since it's hardly cold in Mumbai, it's just been lying in the cupboard. Now, that it is out of fashion and I can let it go!\nAYUSHMANN KHURRANA: TEE OFF\nMy mom has a crazy habit. She will holler, every now and then, \"Clean out the almari\", and it's time for spring cleaning. I have around 15 Tees and a dozen denims, but I keep wearing the same three pairs over and over again. When I was packing for my Maroon 5 concert recently, I found a Tee I'd bought and completely forgotten about. And it made me realise mom was right, it was time to empty the wardrobe.\nREAD: â€‹Priyanka Chopra to romance Fawad Khan\nABHAY DEOL: UNDER KI BAAT\nTorn underwear, for sure!\nHUGH JACKMAN: CRYING WOLF\nMy wife (Deborra-Lee Furness) and I had a disa greement when I signed up for the role of X-Men's Wolverine in 2000. Deb thought it was a terrible idea because it's very self-indulgent, all about me. It was the only time I proved her wrong. I've been Wolverine for so long. But I think I'll need to get rid of my wolf-syndrome next year.Tom Hardy would be a great replacement!\nKONKANA SEN SHARMA: MY DEAR DIARY\nI`ve never kept a journal or diary in particular, but I have a notebook since class 11 whose pages are now dog-eared, with Plato-notes from college, some math problems, lyrics by Alanis Morissette and a few other songs penned down from my 20s. There are things I don't even understand anymore, like little notes a friend and I passed between class.Also, e-words, that I did not know the meaning of then. I haven't updated the notebook in years. May be it's time to give up on it now!\nRAJKUMMAR RAO: SHOE OFF NOW\nI`ve walked the whole of Europe in an amaz ing pair of comfortable shoes. They are close to my heart but worn out now. I think I'll give them away. But I will never throw away my pen from Shahid and the watch which is a memento of CityLights.\nADITI RAO HYDARI: PACK UP\nMy mom gave me a silver key chain when I left for boarding school. It had my trunk and cupboard keys and a beautiful old coin with Persian calligraphy on it.I'll never get rid of that but I think I can discard some of the clothes from that trunk and cupboard now.\nListen to songs of Priyanka Chopra on Gaana.com\nFor latest Bollywood updates follow us on Twitter >>> @TOIEntertain\nFor the latest in Bollywood news, like us on Facebook >>> TOIEntertain\nWATCH: Priyanka Chopra turns director on TV show - BT\nMary Kom Amazon.in : INR 230.00 Buy now ", "external_links": ["http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DcnerS6ML._SL160_.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities", "http://gaana.com/artist/priyanka-chopra", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/YNDEBpZo4IE", "http://www.amazon.in/Mary-Kom-Priyanka-Chopra/dp/B00O1YBHCQ%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJP4GPDYQHXPFUOWQ%26tag%3Dtimofind-21%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB00O1YBHCQ"], "published": "2015-10-05T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T09:47:11.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
