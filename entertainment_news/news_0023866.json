Amsterdam, Netherlands Tommy Hilfiger, which is owned by PVH Corp. [NYSE:PVH], is pleased to announce that Tommy Hilfiger will introduce a virtual reality shopping experience at select stores and wholesale partners worldwide, where consumers will be invited to watch the Fall 2015 Hilfiger Collection runway show in groundbreaking three-dimensional, 360 degree virtual reality. The technology will launch on October 20, 2015, at the Tommy Hilfiger store on 5th Avenue in New York City, followed by additional locations in London, Paris, Milan, Amsterdam, Dusseldorf, Florence, Zurich, and Moscow.  //www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151020005626/en/ Model Wearing Virtual Reality Headset in Tommy Hilfiger's Fifth Avenue Flagship Store (Photo: Business Wire) Using a Samsung GearVR device, shoppers will have an immersive virtual experience that creates the impression of sitting live in the front row at Manhattan’s Park Avenue Armory at showtime on February 16, 2015, when the Fall 2015 Hilfiger Collection was originally presented. The VR experience gives users a perfect view of the runway and provides an exclusive sneak peek backstage, which is typically inaccessible for individuals not involved in the show production. The virtual reality installation lives in store in a dedicated area that reflects the American football theme of the Fall 2015 show, alongside the Hilfiger Collection designs, which consumers can shop immediately. “Through virtual reality, we’re now able to bring our one-of-a-kind fashion show to the retail setting,” said Tommy Hilfiger. “From the incredible set and music to exclusive backstage moments, consumers will be able to watch the clothes move and see the collection in the original show environment – it’s a compelling and interesting elevation of the traditional shopping experience.” “We are driven by a vision to exceed consumer expectations, inspire them, and offer retail experiences they never thought possible,” said Daniel Grieder, CEO of Tommy Hilfiger. “Through cutting-edge virtual reality technology, we can invite shoppers to experience the Hilfiger Collection fashion show from a front row seat. We’re using virtual reality to open the doors to a unique part of our world, directly connecting the consumers in our retail space with one of our largest brand events each season.” The introduction of virtual reality in stores reflects Tommy Hilfiger’s mission to elevate the shopping experience through digital innovation; these technological integrations in the retail space are evolving traditional brick-and-mortar set-ups and increasing opportunities for social engagement. The concept has been created in collaboration with WeMakeVR, developers of 360 degree 3D virtual reality experiences. The show was captured with the WeMakeVR-Falcon, a proprietary camera. “Our special virtual reality cameras, combined with Tommy Hilfiger’s creative vision of the Fall ’15 Hilfiger Collection fashion show, resulted in an experience that goes beyond that of VIP guests,” said Avinash Changa, Founder and CEO of WeMakeVR. “Users get an incredible peek behind the scenes; they stand next to models right before they walk out onto the runway, and they feel the excitement of being backstage after the show.” The Hilfiger Collection virtual reality experience will be available at Tommy Hilfiger stores in London (Brompton Road and Regent Street); Amsterdam (P.C. Hooftstraat); Dusseldorf (Schadowstrasse); Milan (Piazza Guglielmo Oberdan); Florence (Piazza degli Antinori); Zurich (Bahnhofstrasse); Paris (Boulevard des Capucines and Champs-Elysees); and Moscow (Kuznetsky Most). The concept is also launching at wholesale with Selfridges, London’s iconic department store.
