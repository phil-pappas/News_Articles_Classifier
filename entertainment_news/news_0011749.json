Owners Zach Neil and Brian Link opened up Stay Classy New York on the lower east side of Manhattan. The bar boasts an artisanal cocktail menu packed with inside jokes from \"Anchorman,\" but there are also drinks inspired by his famous lines in \"Old School,\" \"Zoolander,\" and \"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby.\" Related Content Mets SS Tejada breaks leg on Utley slide \nNeil told television station WPIX, \"This bar is kind of like the place where a 35-or 40-year-old person could come and sit and not be intimidated by loud techno music but still be surrounded by things that are funny and ridiculous and kind of get it,\" he said. \"Thatâ€™s what Will Ferrell has always meant to us.\"The bar officially opened on Oct. 1 but as the owners will continue filling the bar with Ferrell-inspired items as they get ready for an \"Anchorman\" Halloween party on Oct. 30. No word if Will Ferrell has any plans to stop by the bar, but the owners say he is welcome anytime.
