Taken from the debut album Bridge of Spies, its innovative use of a rap verse by a white female vocalist introduced the world to the distinctive lead vocals of Decker. \nHeart & Soul led to a meteoric rise in T'Pau's fortunes both at home & in the USA, where the track stayed on the US billboard chart for six months. After a UK arena tour supporting Bryan Adams, the band immediately toured UK City Halls as headliners to tie in with the next single, the classic ballad China In Your Hand, which stayed at number one for five weeks - the longest serving No. 1 of the year! \nTo date, China In Your Hand has appeared on more than 150 compilations, and has become one of the most played songs of the 1980's. \nThe original line up of T'Pau split in 1991, but by 1997 Carol had taken the decision to build a new T'Pau. Share article \nCarol has since toured the world, appeared on the West End stage and on TV and played a packed out Big Top tent at Isle of Wight Festival 2013. \nTickets: the-brook.com or 023 8055 5366.
