On those days, the authors will be available through social media to answer questions and interact with fans.\nThe concept of the Great Year is based on documentation from more than 31 ancient civilizations, tracking the Earth through a 26,000 year cycle as it slowly wobbles on its axis; something NASA refers to as \"the period of one complete cycle of the equinoxes around the ecliptic,\" and Plato called the \"Perfect Year.\" History correlates the rise and fall of human consciousness through the ages with this same cycle. Using this as the unifying theme, the authors also reference philosophies and archaeological sites they researched for 3 ½ years before writing the first book, including:\nthe pyramids and compound at Tiahuanaco in Bolivia the discovery of a highly advanced civilization estimated to be more than 11,000 years old at Gobekli Tepi in Turkey the Indian Sanskrit Vedas the life and legends surrounding Genghis Khan in the Book of Mongols and for the sequel, The I Ching of China . This knowledge is woven into an epic love story and adventure consciousness novel that is an unforgettable tale of power, devotion, lust, and spirituality. For readers who want to dig deeper into this information, the authors provide a comprehensive bibliography and resource list at the end of the book.\nAbout the Authors:\nBorn and raised in the Vancouver area, Rene DeFazio is an actor, screenwriter and producer with numerous film and television roles to his credit, as well as countless commercials and print ads.
