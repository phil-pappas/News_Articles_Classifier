Excess annual medical spending in the region attributable to overweight and obesity is estimated at $501 million.\nOverweight and obesity rates here are similar to those found throughout the country and in other parts of upstate New York. Overweight and obesity rates range from 60.6 percent in the Finger Lakes Region to 66.2 percent in the Southern Tier.\nThe report correlates obesity with arthritis, Type 2 diabetes, asthma, cardiovascular disease and stroke. In addition, obesity is associated with cancer, gallbladder disease and chronic back pain, and new evidence shows that obesity increases the risk of depression.\nTo view the report, see below or click here .\nBLOUDON@Gannett.com", "external_links": ["https://www.excellusbcbs.com/wps/wcm/connect/d33a049d-8f22-43e2-86b0-454ec3319da1/Obesity+FS+2015-EX+FINAL.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CACHEID=d33a049d-8f22-43e2-86b0-454ec3319da1", "https://drive.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https%3A//www.excellusbcbs.com/wps/wcm/connect/d33a049d-8f22-43e2-86b0-454ec3319da1/Obesity%2BFS%2B2015-EX%2BFINAL.pdf%3FMOD%3DAJPERES%26CACHEID%3Dd33a049d-8f22-43e2-86b0-454ec3319da1&embedded=true"], "published": "2015-10-19T21:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:15:35.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
