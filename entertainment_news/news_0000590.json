I held his lil' paw as he was finally at peace,\" Johnson wrote. \nThe news comes just weeks after Johnson saved Brutus from drowning in his family pool. \nJohnson explains that Brutus ate a mushroom while playing outside with the wrestler's other puppy, Hobbs, but unfortunately, \"this mushroom happened to have a lethal toxicity and within hours it was rapidly destroying his liver and immune system to the point of no return.\" \nJohnson thanked the \"incredibly caring\" nurses and staff at The Animal Medical Center at Cooper City for doing everything they could to try to save Brutus, and he warned dog owners to be mindful of mushrooms in \"yards, parks or anywhere outside your dogs play.\" \n\"We'll always love you Brutus,\" wrote Johnson, \"And you'll always be my lil' main man and rough housing Brute.\" \n  Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 11:00AM by", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T12:23:48.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
