She ultimately concludes that she's \"over\" finding adorable ways to state her opinion. Lenny is a recently launched weekly newsletter from Lena Dunham and her \"Girls\" executive producer Jenni Konner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:58:35.354+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
