Photo: James Brickwood \nThe lead-up to any major exhibition is always stressful but Jeremy Sheehan's extraordinary project, Trans Migration , has caused him way more than his fair share of anxious moments.\nThe work involves artists from 22 nations spread over several hundred million square kilometres of the Pacific and is scarily dependent on the vagaries of local postal systems. Bringing it all together in time for Sculpture by the Sea has been a monumental task.\nIn many ways, it is this reliance on the kindness of strangers and on good luck that is at the heart of the work.\nA mutton bird made with plastic waste for Sculpture by the Sea. Photo: James Brickwood \nIt all began about a year ago when Sheehan, a teacher at Coffs Harbour TAFE, started working with his students on a project to highlight the plight of the mutton birds that often wash up on local beaches, killed by the plastic waste they eat during their long migrations.\nAdvertisement Sheehan hit on the idea of making life-size, wire-frame birds with a \"skeleton\" of plastic waste then sending them off to artist communities throughout the Pacific who would finish the outer layer of the birds in local material before returning them.\nThe surface layer would then degrade in time, revealing the awful truth of the plastic waste underneath.\n\"After a lot of research I worked out the flight path of the mutton birds from Coffs Harbour and which are the important islands that they stop over on their migration,\" says Sheehan. \"Where every bird 'landed' we wanted to get the community really involved.\"\nHaving come up with the idea, the first monumental task was to make contact with local artists in communities as far flung as Tokelau, Tuvalu and Kiribati, explain the nature of the project and ask them to take part.\n\"I just asked people if they knew anybody on the islands,\" says Sheehan. \"That gave us a few leads but the majority were just cold emails and letters. We emailed pretty much anyone we could get an email address for and asked them if they knew anybody.\"\nHelp for the project came from surprising quarters. In Kiribati, for instance, initial contact was made with Australia's high commissioner there, George Fraser.\n\"He actually drove to this artist's house and knocked on his door to ask him if he wanted to be part of the project,\" says Sheehan.\nWhile the initial response in many cases was an enthusiastic \"yes\", on other islands it proved trickier to find the right people.\n\"Someone said to me, 'The people on these islands are promised so much and it rarely ever gets delivered to them',\" says Sheehan. \"That made me very mindful that we are asking for that whole kindness from a stranger thing.\"\nEventually the 22 pieces of the jigsaw fell into place and 22 separate stories of postal disasters, heroic persistence, astonishing creativity and heart-warming dedication unfolded.\n\"Every bird has a story behind it, which has blown me away,\" says Sheehan. \"Then I think, Holy crap! they've given me so much and it's part of my duty now to make sure something comes of it and it's received in the right way.\"\nMany of the birds undertook a tortuous journey – just as in real life – before making it back to Australia. The bird that eventually arrived from Tokelau was first sent to a contact in Samoa, who then sent it by boat to his brother in Tokelau because there is no air transport between the two island nations. \n\"His brother is a master fisherman and he wanted to communicate to the other fishermen that something needed to be done,\" says Sheehan. \"He then gave the bird to his sister who was travelling back to Samoa by boat as the climate change representative on her way to a summit at the Vatican.\"\nSculpture By The Sea founding director David Handley, who has worked closely with Sheehan, says Trans Migration is a particular favourite for many reasons.\nThe whole project, which has particular resonance about climate change and the loss of cultural identity in the Pacific, has been \"an absolute breath of fresh air\".\n\"It really encapsulates the sort of opportunity that I always dreamt of providing to artists,\" he says. \"It's so wonderful that in our 19th year artists are still responding with this extraordinary mixture of creativity and humanity and generosity of spirit.\"\nFor Sheehan, the success of a project so fraught with practical difficulties, that relied on the goodwill of so many people in the region, has renewed his faith in humanity.\n\"The whole way along I've been thinking someone is going to turn around and go 'This is a really dumb idea, why are you doing it?'\" he says. \"But nobody has. That's been incredibly profound for me. That was always the hope behind it all.\"\nSculpture by the Sea 2015 opens on October 22,  sculpturebythesea.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:20:31.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
