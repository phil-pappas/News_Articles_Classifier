Like, really intimate.\nFlaming Lips frontman Wayne Coyne shared an Instagram photo (depicting his bare-shouldered bandmates and Cyrus) announcing they will play in the buff. For a naked crowd.\n“[Cyrus] is planning a show where her, the band (us) and the audience are all COMPLETELY naked with milk (well white stuff that looks like milk) is being being spewed everywhere,” Coyne wrote. “It’s a video (in the works) for #mileycyrusandherdeadpetz song ‘The Milky Milky Milk.’”\nThe Flaming Lips collaborated with the “Wrecking Ball” artist on her newest record, Miley Cyrus and Her Dead Petz, which she surprise-released during the MTV VMAs. (EW awarded it an A-.) The “Milky Milky Milk” video will follow the video for “Doo It!”, which was released the day the album came out.\nCyrus and Coyne previously collaborated on the trippy short film “Blonde SuperFreak Steals the Magic Brain.”\nTickets went on sale for Cyrus and the group’s tour last week; it begins Nov. 19 in Chicago.\nComments", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:00:43.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
