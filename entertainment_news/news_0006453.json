An offshoot of Philadelphia public radio station WXPN's \"Zydeco Crossroads\" project, the feature-length music documentary will make its New Orleans premiere Tuesday, Oct. 27, at the University of New Orleans' Robert E. Nims Theatre in the Lakefront Campus' Performing Arts Center.\nThe screening, which is free, will mark the film's New Orleans premiere. It will be preceded by an introduction from Mugge (\"New Orleans: Music in Exile,\" \"Deep Blues\") and will be followed by a live musical performance by Major Handy and the Louisiana Blues Band.\nWXPN's \"Zydeco Crossroads\" project is a 15-month celebration and exploration of Cajun and Creole music and culture featuring broadcasts, live concerts and more. \"Let's find (a) ... great American genre that our audience will respond to, that's underexposed in Philadelphia that people really ought to know about,\" WXPN General Manager Roger LaMay says in describing the program in Mugge's film.\nIn addition to a website filled with essays, videos and music clips -- and through which episodes of the program can be streamed -- it spawned Mugge's 87-minute film. Shot primarily in and around Lafayette, Mugge's \"Zydeco Crossroads: A Tale of Two Cities\" focuses on the cross-fertilization of music from Lafayette to Philadelphia, the two cities referenced in the film's title. In the process, it showcases performances by such zydeco performers as Buckwheat Zydeco, CJ Chenier, Nathan Willliams, Chubby Carrier, Rosie Ledet and Rockin' Dopsie Jr., as well as interviews about the music of southwest Louisiana and the \"Zydeco Crossroads\" project.\nFor more on Mugge's \"Zydeco Crossroads: A Tale of Two Cities,\" watch the extended, 16-minute trailer at Vimeo .
