Lyn Muse Interiors, Inc. worked closely with Drose Raney Architects of Dallas, craftsmen Paul Meilinger of Dallas and Mark White Inc. of Maine, along with contractor Bill Welch of Whitesboro, TX to create a sophisticated environment that evokes western tradition and handmade craftsmanship, two things that stand at the heart of Lucchese’s 132-year, Texas-bred heritage.\n“We strived to incorporate the welcoming nature of western culture into a modern aesthetic,” said Lyn Muse. “Our amazingly dedicated and creative team enjoyed bringing this vision to life for Lucchese and we’re honored to have our work recognized by the ICAA.”\nTo embody the spirit of Lucchese craftsmanship and detail, the store’s rustic ceiling, hardwood floors and display fixtures were constructed from hand-hewn white oak beams reclaimed from barns built in the late 1800s, around the same time Lucchese set up shop in San Antonio.\nThe refined space boasts a divided, yet invitingly cohesive design. The left side incorporates darker, more masculine colors to showcase menswear while the right, lighter and more feminine, displays women’s offerings. The wide of array of merchandise includes handmade western boots as well as stylish and western-inspired footwear, apparel and accessories.\nA slightly secluded, yet key feature of the store exists in the back where a dedicated design center allows customers to sit comfortably around a working table with Lucchese Fit Experts to create one-of-a-kind custom boots, choosing from an array of leathers, toes and heels.\nAn awards gala honoring the John Staub award recipients is set for Saturday, Oct.16, at La Colombe D’Or Hotel. The sold-out event will begin with a reception, followed by the lunch and awards presentation.

ICAA fulfills its mission through six program areas: education, academic programs, public education programs, publications, awards, and advocacy.\nAbout John Staub Awards:\nThe John Staub Awards, launched in 2011 by the Texas Chapter of the Institute of Classical Architecture & Art (ICCA), recognize excellence in design and craftsmanship produced by Texas-based architects, landscape architects, interior designers and artisans. Projects constructed within the last ten years are eligible for consideration.\nJohn F. Staub was a residential architect who designed many traditionally styled homes and mansions, primarily in Houston, from the 1920s to 1960s. Staub was noted for his ability to combine selected elements from historical styles into unique creations that expressed the architect's own sensibilities and the demands of his commissions. His houses are known for their attention to detail and the thoughtful consideration placed to site location. Staub designed many homes in the prestigious Houston neighborhood of River Oaks. His most famous work is Bayou Bend, a mansion built in 1927 for oil heiress Ima Hogg. The estate, and its collection of antique decorative arts, is now a part of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.\nAbout Lucchese:\nTexas-based Lucchese is a legendary bootmaker and iconic brand of the American West. Applying the same craftsmanship principles and techniques since 1883, Lucchese artisans use only the finest leathers, preeminent materials and a proprietary twisted cone last to construct boots of unrivaled quality, fit, comfort and style.\nFor more information visit:\nhttp://www.lucchese.com\nhttp://www.facebook.com/lucchesebootco\nhttp://www.twitter.com/lucchese1883\nhttp://www.instagram.com/lucchese\n###", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mYWNlYm9vay5jb20vbHVjY2hlc2Vib290Y28=", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbGFzc2ljaXN0LXRleGFzLm9yZy8jITIwMTUtam9obi1zdGF1Yi1hd2FyZC13aW5uZXJzL2NhdzM=", "http://www.instagram.com/lucchese", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbnN0YWdyYW0uY29tL2x1Y2NoZXNl", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sdWNjaGVzZS5jb20=", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy50d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9sdWNjaGVzZTE4ODM=", "http://www.facebook.com/lucchesebootco", "http://www.classicist-texas.org/#!2015-john-staub-award-winners/caw3", "http://www.twitter.com/lucchese1883"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:20:54.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
