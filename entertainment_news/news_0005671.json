Directed by Liesl Tommy. \nWith Lupita Nyong'o, Saycon Sengbloh, Pascale Armand, Zainab Jah and Akosua Busia. \nSchedule: 8 p.m. Tuesday through Friday; 2 and 8 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. \nTickets: $90. 212-967-7555 or publictheater.org. \nLupita Nyong'o's memorable, Oscar-winning portrayal of a brutalized young woman in \"12 Years a Slave\" is rivaled by her gripping performance in \"Eclipsed,\" in her New York stage debut. \nThe slender 32-year-old actress plays a frightened 15-year-old girl caught up in the endless cruelty of the Liberian civil war. \nHer character, identified only as the Girl, is taken as a \"wife\" by a commanding officer in the rebel army fighting President Charles Taylor, joining several other women he has captured and pressed into service as combination cooks, cleaners and sex slaves. \nDanai Gurira's fierce, angry play, which opened Wednesday night at the Public Theater, is set in the early 2000s, but its tale of women struggling to maintain a sense of self amid unspeakable degradation feels depressingly current. \nThe Girl is Wife Number Four — the women don't use their names, burying them for when the war ends, when they'll (hopefully) be free and in possession once again of their lives. \nWife Number One (Saycon Sengbloh) has been held captive so long, she doesn't even remember how old she is. Amid her suffering, though, she's also adapted to her circumstances. She feels a certain pride in being the first, boss wife, in charge of the others. That she's no longer desired by her \"husband\" sexually is both a relief and a shame. \nShe tried to hide the Girl when the younger woman stumbled into the rebel's camp, but the Girl was discovered, raped and assigned to the hut with the other women. \nWife Number Three, the pregnant Bessie (Pascale Armand), is good-natured, flighty and vain, dealing with her plight by fixating on her clothes and hairstyle. \nThe absent Number Two, Maima (Zainab Jah), shows up later, a swaggering rebel warrior with an automatic weapon slung over her shoulder. She's taken the only path to escape from being a subjugated woman, which is to become, like a man, a pitiless killer. \nThe Girl is different from the others not only in being much younger, but also because she received an education before being separated from her parents, and knows how to read. \nOne of the few glints of humor during the evening happens when she finds an abandoned book in the hut, a biography of Bill Clinton, and reads aloud to the other women about Monica Lewinsky. They listen avidly, while not quite comprehending why she isn't simply regarded as a Number Two wife. \nAll the actresses are exceptional, but it's the Girl who's at the center of the evening, and Nyong'o, with her expressive eyes, fully captures her fear and uncertainty, from the heart-tugging sadness when she's summoned by the (unseen) commander to his bed to the unsettling combination of terror and eagerness when she decides to cast her lot with Maima and become a soldier. \nGurira is not inclined to subtlety in presenting the agony of her characters, and occasionally there are soap-box moments, as when a peace activist (Akosua Busia) arrives at the camp to declare her outrage at the women's circumstances. \nDirector Liesl Tommy, who does marvelously well in presenting the individuality of the captive women, also goes for obvious symbolism at times: When the Girl goes to sleep, she lays her head on the book. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:48:36.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
