The films argue that taxpayers were stuck with the bills for stadiums that cost several times their initial estimates. \nThe critical documentaries were screened at the Rio Film Festival, which closes Wednesday. The films come as Brazil enters the final stretch before next year's Olympics in Rio de Janeiro and amid an unfurling corruption crisis at World Cup organizer FIFA. \nThink your friends should see this?
