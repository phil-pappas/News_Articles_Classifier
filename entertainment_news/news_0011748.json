By STEPHEN HAWKINS ARLINGTON, Texas — Troy Tulowitzki drove in four runs, including a three-run homer for his first hit this postseason, and the Toronto Blue Jays avoided elimination in the AL Division Series with a 5-1 win over the Texas Rangers in Game 3 on Sunday night.\nThe Blue Jays cut their deficit to 2-1 in the best-of-five matchup.\nTexas has another chance today to clinch the series at home. If not, a deciding Game 5 will be played Wednesday in Toronto, where the Rangers won the first two games.\nMarco Estrada limited the Rangers to one run and five hits over 6 1/3 innings.\nTulowitzki’s two-out homer in the sixth put the Blue Jays up 5-0. That was two innings after he drew a bases-loaded walk.\nTexas left-hander Martin Perez, somewhat a surprise pick as the Game 3 starter over veterans Derek Holland and Colby Lewis, gave up four runs and six hits.\nHolland (4-3) will start Game 4 for the Rangers against knuckleballer R.A. Dickey (11-11) of the Blue Jays.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14802730.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14802730.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-11T18:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:48:41.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
