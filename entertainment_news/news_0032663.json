Becca Collins, an outreach worker to MSFWs in 1976, is fiercely devoted to her clients. Her devotion is challenged, however, when she accidentally discovers a gruesome murder. Alone and afraid, she gladly welcomes successful high school football coach Jack Hightower into her life.\n“Chattanooga Girl” follows Becca as she works to improve the living and working conditions of MSFWs, no matter the risk. Readers watch as her romance with Jack turns into something more, all while she betters the lives of the MSFWs – even when facing the same dangers they do.\nCoakley hopes her book will help readers realize how poor the working conditions are for many MSFWs, even today. She also aims to thrill sports fans with Jack’s real football strategies, inspired by her close friend and National Football Hall of Fame coach, Herbert E. Goldsmith, who passed away in 2013.\n“This book will appeal to those who enjoy a strong female character, a good mystery, a tender love story and football strategies from a winning coach,” Coakley says.\n“Chattanooga Girl”\nBy Dottie Coakley\nSoftcover | 6 x 9 in | 188 pages | ISBN 9781483430218\nE-Book | 188 pages | ISBN 9781483430201\nAbout the Author\nDottie Coakley was born and raised in Chattanooga, Tennessee.
