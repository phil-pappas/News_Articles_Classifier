Her recent best-selling book, The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness , spurred debate and action in universities, churches, prisons, and communities nationwide.\n\"Michelle's work has made a profound contribution to our understanding of race and justice in the United States today, and we are deeply honored to have her join us as a Senior Fellow,\" said Darren Walker , president of the Ford Foundation. \"For over a decade, her authoritative scholarship and powerful storytelling have helped change minds and transform lives.
