Since then he's been alert, conscious and all that.\" \nWhen the operator asked, \"As far as you know, no cocaine since Saturday?\", Mr Hunter replied: \"That is correct.\" bang showbiz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:57:18.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
