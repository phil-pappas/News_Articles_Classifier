In an interview with a popular news channel, the senior lyricist said \"it is the content of a song that is paramount.\" Expressing his disappointment over FM radio stations and TV music channels often missing out on mentioning the lyricists, Ramajogayya Sastry says there is still a \"wide gap to be filled\". The lyricist also requested music lovers to \"research and acknowledge\" lyricists' efforts in giving them meaningful songs. Interestingly, Ramajogayya Sastry recently stated that the producers of Srimanthudu surprised him with extra remuneration for his efforts in the success of the film's audio album.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:35:21.702+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
