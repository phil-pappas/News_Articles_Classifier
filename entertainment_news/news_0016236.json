Photo: Andrew Meares \nOn Monday night, Q&A had a serious message for the presently glowing political world of Mr 67 Per Cent: Malcolm , it's a jungle out there.\nThe Prime Minister was not physically present on this special episode devoted to a dense discussion of foreign affairs - a subject host Tony Jones admitted was often neglected by the media, his own program included - but Malcolm Turnbull and by extension the shadow of his predecessor hovered over proceedings from the opening question.\nThe premise underlying much of the program was: where does Australia stand and what does she do next in a post-Abbott, post-shirtfront era of diplomacy? And specifically, the first questioner wanted to know, just how stupid do we look on the world stage after our recent experiment with changing prime ministers as if they were days-of-the-week underpants?\nBob Carr thought Malcolm Turnbull being PM at least places Australia back on friendlier global ground on issues like climate change. Photo: ABC \nBob Carr, a former foreign minister with up-close memories of underwear shedding on the Labor side, thought there were pros and cons - the current pro being that Turnbull at least places Australia back on friendlier global ground on issues like climate change after Tony Abbott's association with what he called \"somewhat distasteful international postures\".\nAdvertisement Fellow panellist Michael Fullilove​, director of the Lowy Institute and deliverer of this year's ABC Boyer Lecture series, was more concerned: \"I think it is a more serious problem than Bob allows. It is not just five PMs in five years, four foreign ministers in five years of which he was one, six defence ministers in five years. And that interrupts the momentum of ministers and PMs, it means they can't solve problems in the way we want them to, which is why we elect them, and it also clouds international perceptions of our reliability of a country ... I think this is a long-term problem for us and we have to get our mojo back.\"\nFullilove saw reason for hope in the Turnbull ascension, suggesting the new PM \"sees a broader spectrum of colours in the world. I think Tony Abbott saw it very much in black and white. I think Turnbull does the hope end of the spectrum as well as the fear end of the spectrum, and I think that's right, because there are great opportunities in the world as well as big challenges, and I think Turnbull is probably better equipped to dodge the challenges and seize the opportunities.\"\nHere's hoping, because as Q&A made clear, challenges abound. China, mostly. Syria, immediately. Climate change, now and forever.\nOn China, the debate focused on the broader question of whether Australia leans towards its traditional alliance with the US or strikes a more independent posture, and more specifically on territorial rights in the South China Sea. Sow Keat Tok, of the Centre for Contemporary Chinese Studies at Melbourne University, had worrying warnings on the latter situation.\nThe Americans, he said, were \"basically playing a game of chicken ... who is going to blink first?\"\nLeft unsaid: what if no one blinks?\nAlison Broinowski​, author and former Australian diplomat, suggested Australia needed to re-examine its blind faith in the US alliance. \"The idea that we ... are protected by the US from anything and everything is completely erroneous. It is becoming more erroneous now because the US is losing its grip on sole, hegemonic power. It is still enormously powerful economically and military, of course, but it is losing its capacity to fight wars and win them. Don't forget that since 1945 we have fought numerous wars with the US, and we haven't won one. This is not a good look. Even if it was a business, you would have to ask yourself would you go on investing in that, would you go on believing that this is the way to guarantee Australia's security?\"\nAnd on Syria, the live and looming war of the moment? Fair to say this assembly of great foreign-policy minds left you wondering where we're headed there given no one among them could summon a clear game plan, solution or predict an outcome.\nThe message for Malcolm overall: enjoy that honeymoon in the stratosphere, PM, because there's a world full of booby-traps awaiting when you come back down to earth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T21:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:02:00.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
