Yet the University of Washington’s Board of Regents has shown a consistent pattern of making decisions in secret.\nWhether Ana Mari Cauce is the right person to serve as the university’s new president is not the issue — she is. This editorial board has praised her appointment . The problem is a culture that does not value public transparency.\nAs reported by The Seattle Times’ Lewis Kamb , the Board of Regents appeared to decide early on that Cauce was their top choice. A two-page news release was polished and ready to go Oct. 13 before the regents held a public vote during a special meeting.\nLast April, a King County judge ruled the board violated state open-meeting laws 24 times from 2012-14 by privately discussing university business over dinner at the president’s residence.\nMost Read Stories 5 ways CaliBurger is better than In-N-Out Seattle Seahawks fan: Why I'm flipping the switch and turning off my loyalties to this team Seattle Mariners hire Scott Servais as manager, expected to name Tim Bogar bench coach Files for lawsuit against CIA stolen in 'suspicious' break-in at UW Bill the Butcher workers still seeking CEO who vanished with their pay Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. University regents should remember they are accountable to the people of this state. And their new president should remind them at every opportunity. Washington State University’s Board of Regents needs to get the same message as it begins their search for a new president.\nTaxpayers have a right to know about the inner workings of these institutions, especially with regard to major decisions like the selection of the university’s top leader. Citizens, in general, should have access to the same information the regents use to make decisions. That’s the only way to ensure they are working in the public interest.\n“We can do the same analysis and see if we come up with the same answer,” says Toby Nixon, president of the Washington Coalition for Open Government (WashCOG) .\nNixon warns the UW’s open-meeting fumbles represents a growing trend in Washington. Every year in Olympia, WashCOG goes up against agencies and lobbyists advocating for legislative changes that would make public access to records more difficult. Agencies and lobbyists often argue pulling information takes too much time or resources. Nonsense.\nNow WashCOG itself is facing challenges. A source of grant funding — nearly half of WashCOG’s roughly $60,000 annual budget — is no longer available. The organization has raised enough to stay afloat for now, but it needs help to maintain programs and administrative support.\nConcerned citizens can ensure WashCOG continues to demand transparency in government by making a monetary donation at washingtoncog.org .\nEditorial board members are editorial page editor Kate Riley, Frank A.
