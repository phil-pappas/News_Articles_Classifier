And while Chino Moreno and company served up satisfying staples such as \"Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away),\" \"My Own Summer (Shove It),\" \"Diamond Eyes,\" \"Sextape\" and \"Change (In the House of Flies),\" sadly, the set didn't include any new material.\nSix months later, the band returns fresh off a co-headlining tour with Incubus, stocked with material from a new album that's set to be released sometime in the next month or so.\nWill Vegas be treated to a sneak peek of the record? It's hard to say. There doesn't seem to be any real extensive plan right now to hit the road in support of the record, at least not until after the first of the year, according to frontman Moreno, who spoke with college radio station WSOU in New Jersey at the end of the summer.\nWhat's more, recent set lists haven't been drastically different from the Rock In Rio sequence. So, yeah, it's hard to say if they'll unveil any of those new songs live yet, but it seems likely that a few could surface. After all, they're going to have to road test the new material at some point in advance of the next tour, and now seems as good a time as any.\nWhatever the case, if the band's past two releases are any indication, the as-yet-untitled album should be stellar, as the quintet has continually progressed with each record and remained consistent when it comes to creating compelling music â€” and that's noteworthy when you're talking about a modern rock act that's been around for more than two decades.\nWhile there hasn't been a ton revealed yet about the new album, Jerry Cantrell from Alice in Chains reportedly makes a cameo, and in his chat with WSOU, Moreno talked about how bassist Sergio Vega (who stepped in for the since dearly departed Chi Cheng in 2009) plays a six-string bass on the album, which Moreno says provides a solid tonal counterpoint to what he and guitarist Stephen Carpenter are playing.\nStop by Brooklyn Bowl on Tuesday to see if Deftones break out any of the new songs. Expect them to deliver either way.\nRead more from Dave Herrera at reviewjournal.com. Contact him at dherrera@reviewjournal.com . \nAdele releases first single...
