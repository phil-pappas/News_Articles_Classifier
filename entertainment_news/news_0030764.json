Or might you chow down on a plate of cabbage if they adorned Paul McCartney’s suit? Maybe not (sorry Paul, cabbage will always be gross, even if you’re wearing it), but Peta’s vegetable portraits of iconic British vegetarians are quite a sight. Russell Brand (SAW Photography/Peta) \nThe nutrient-packed celebrities are the work of Prudence Staite, a Gloucestershire food artist with a knack for turning carrots and courgettes into tumbling curls. Morrissey (SAW Photography/Peta) \nDoesn’t strident vegetarian Morrissey look pleased with his asparagus jacket? Joanna Lumley (SAW Photography/Peta) \nPeta and Prudence teamed up to create the nutrient-packed portraits to celebrate World Vegetarian Day, and to highlight how many big stars have ditched meat for a greener diet. Leona Lewis (SAW Photography/PETA) \nPeta’s director Mimi Bekhechi says: “Many of today’s biggest stars are choosing vegetarian and vegan meals every time they sit down to eat. \n“And what better day than World Vegetarian Day to choose to follow in their great example and go meat-free – for their health, the planet and animals too.” Paul McCartney (SAW Photography/Peta) \nAccording to Peta, cutting out meat from your diet helps save around 100 animals a year. A veggie diet can also reduce the risk of developing cancer, obesity and diabetes.
