Neal, after years of being a supporting player to classic blues artists B.B. King, John Lee Hooker, Big Mama Thornton, Muddy Waters, James Cotton, Bobby Rush and Bobby “Blue” Bland, recently began emphasizing his work as a front man. \nThis year’s Blues Foundation gala will also feature a tribute to King, including a display of one of the late blues star’s Lucille guitars and a performance by Neal. Baton Rouge blues singer-pianist Henry Gray will play before the award ceremony. General admission is $35.
