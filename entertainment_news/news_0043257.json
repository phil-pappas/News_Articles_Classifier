When I researched about the neuro-developmental disorder, what I found is that such children will be extremely good at something or the other,\" she says.\nLeona's role in the movie too is on similar lines. \"I play Gemini's aunt who identifies her strengths and supports her to nurture her skills,\" she explains, adding she wants to travel and meet such kids soon. Sijoy Varghese plays Gemini's dad in the film, while Tanushree Ghosh, her mother.\nMeanwhile, Leona will be also seen in Anish Varma's movie Zoom that has Bhagat Manuel in the lead. \"The movie is a humourous investigative thriller in which I will play a model.
