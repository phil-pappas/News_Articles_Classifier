He says the board will likely send a letter next week asking Attorney General Lisa Madigan for an opinion because it doesn't have authority to take action.\nNevada regulators on Thursday ordered the sites to shut down, saying they can't operate in the state without a gambling license.\nThe sites insist they're skill-based — not chance-based — wagers and therefore not subject to gambling regulations.\nIllinois doesn't allow internet gambling. State law prohibits playing \"a game of chance or skill for money or other thing of value.\"\nAssociated Press\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56217136/turbine/ct-illinois-gaming-board-fantasy-sports-sites-20151016"], "published": "2015-10-17T00:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:16:01.714+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
