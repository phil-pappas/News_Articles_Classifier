A few years ago, no one would have even taken postpartum depression seriously.... http://t.co/af6bL4rCub\n— Pilar Clark (@daspilar) October 13, 2015 Brooke Shields was one of the the most famous celebrities in recent years to highlight her struggles, back in 2005, when she traded barbs in public with Tom Cruise who criticized her use of anti-depressants after the birth of her daughter. He later apologized and she wrote a book about how she dealt with near suicidal feelings, Down Came the Rain: My Journey Through Postpartum Depression .\nPanettiere, 26, whose character on Nashville also has battled the post-baby blues, had a baby girl, Kaya Evodokia, 10 months ago with her fiance, boxer Wladimir Klitschko.\nIn one of her latest tweets, she celebrated the return of her pre-baby body.\nFeeling like I'm #finally coming back in to my own body!mother #daughter #blessing #wellworthit @bonesthenskin pic.twitter.com/ZwUDyo4MhF\n— hayden panettiere (@haydenpanettier) October 10, 2015 Since Kaya's birth, Panettiere has been open about her depression, a serious condition and not as uncommon as some people think. When she stopped by Live with Kelly and Michael last month, she talked frankly about her experience.\n“It’s something a lot of women experience,\" she said. \"When (you’re told) about postpartum depression you think it’s ‘I feel negative feelings towards my child, I want to injure or hurt my child’ — I’ve never, ever had those feelings. Some women do.\n\"But you don’t realize how broad of a spectrum you can really experience that on. It’s something that needs to be talked about. Women need to know that they’re not alone, and that it does heal.”\nShe also tried to dispel some of the common myths about postpartum depression.\n“There’s a lot of misunderstanding — there’s a lot of people out there that think that it’s not real, that it’s not true, that it’s something that’s made up in their minds, that ‘Oh, it’s hormones.’ They brush it off. It’s something that’s completely uncontrollable. It’s really painful and it’s really scary and women need a lot of support.”\nUSA TODAY\nHayden Panettiere: Postpartum depression 'needs to be talked about'\n8 CONNECT 33 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 //usat.ly/1LsZuDg TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/hayden-panettiere-seeking-treatment-for-postpartum-depression-20151310", "https://twitter.com/bonesthenskin", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/daughter?src=hash", "http://t.co/af6bL4rCub", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LsZuDg&mini=true", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4556224879001_thumbnail-for-video-4556016012001.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://usat.ly/1Lt5Gey", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4556224881001_video-still-for-video-4556016012001.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635803548918333290-XXX-2014-EMMYS-Panettiere-077.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4556224881001_video-still-for-video-4556016012001.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2009d24507d9265464371233d43b42bf4c3e2885/c=294-0-4890-3456&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635803548918333290-XXX-2014-EMMYS-Panettiere-077.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34f3c12e46e775b6bc7e523d797ba40d553715a7/r=540&c=540x304/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4556224881001_video-still-for-video-4556016012001.jpg", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/wellworthit?src=hash", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635803548918333290-XXX-2014-EMMYS-Panettiere-077.jpg", "http://t.co/ZwUDyo4MhF", "https://twitter.com/haydenpanettier/status/652743003908370432", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f859d00373359805d25ef76c9678e1265ecfc1bb/c=0-0-2004-2004/local/-/media/2015/09/30/USATODAY/USATODAY/635791993019121955-GTY-454228028.jpg", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/finally?src=hash", "http://celebritybabies.people.com/2015/10/13/hayden-panettiere-postpartum-depression-enters-treatment/", "http://usat.ly/1LsZuDg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LsZuDg&text=Hayden%20Panettiere%20seeks%20treatment%20for%20postpartum%20depression&via=usatoday", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/blessing?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/daspilar/status/654051469134446592"], "published": "2015-10-14T01:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:45:20.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
