He officially announced his return to highlife music in an interview on Hitz FM's Showbiz Fylla with Amanda Jissih. \nOfori Amponsah went into hibernation in 2008 - after releasing his last major highlife song - to concentrate on God’s work and to record gospel music. \nThe musician, who recently announced his return to doing highlife music even though he is the Head Pastor of Family of Faith and Love Ministries Church, says he sees nothing wrong with doing what one loves and still worshipping God. \n“You can worship God and be yourself, do whatever you are doing, He looks at the heart of people,” he said. \nAsked if he was called by God to be a pastor or it was a personal decision, Ofori Amponsah said, he was a Christian before he started music so he had to appreciate his Maker. \nHe said, “Sometimes I will lie in a room and pray for 10 hours telling God to help me come out and fortunately, I came out as Ofori Amponsah so it was like giving back to God for what He has done for me.” \nOfori Amponsah, however, noted that the life one lives should not matter as much as what one is passionate about. \nThe ‘Emmanuella’ singer said, “I stand for love and when I read the Bible, the Bible talks also about love, love is the pillar of the word of God so there is this connection between what I say and the bible that I believe in.” \nOn how his congregation thought about his decision to be a pastor and still do highlife, he said, “everybody has the right to come to Christ. He is the final judge so I don't want to discourage anybody but if you really love to come and worship, fine we can worship together Sunday.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T05:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:01:51.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
