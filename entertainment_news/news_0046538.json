Or just been there. They would totally want to be our friends... right?\nAnyways, Aziz Ansari uploaded the below short film to Instagram which he captioned; “CHRIS PRATT AND AZIZ ANSARI present… ‘Hi Guys', crediting Jennifer Lawrence as the director, Amy Schumer as director of photography, and all four of them as writers.\nWhile Schumer also posted a video of a pretty loud wake up call she got (or is it her sister??) from Lawrence and Ansari...\n(That's Lawrence at the start holding the mug.)\nPratt and Lawrence are starring together in the sci-fi romance Passengers, while Schumer and Ansari are currently on tour with the Oddball Comedy Festival. Also Schumer and Lawrence are said to be writing a screenplay together too and you probably know already that Pratt and Ansari star in Park and Recreation together.\nAll of this explains why they may have been hanging out this weekend... we're sure they'll call us next time.\nMORE: 5 Quote: s from JLaw's New York Times interview - meds, Amy Schumer, Kris Jenner and more\nMORE: Pic: Jennifer Lawrence festoons Amy Schumer's hotel room after Emmy win\nMORE: Watch: Amy Schumer talks about hanging around with Jennifer Lawrence with Jon Stewart", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:19:18.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
