We're here to help.\nTo assist voters in making an educated decision in the race for Monroe County executive on Election Day — Tuesday, Nov. 3 — the Democrat and Chronicle has set out to contrast the three candidates.\nIt's not always easy. While the Green Party candidate's positions often stand apart, the Democrat and the Republican in the race agree on some major issues, much as they might be loathe to admit it.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nRajesh Barnabas challenges status quo\nBoth Sandra Frankel and Cheryl Dinolfo have vowed not to raise property taxes (or service fees, or chargebacks, or whatever other creatively named expenses might appear on property owners' tax bills).\nThey also have pledged to set up a county Office of Public Integrity. Both women say they will be active participants in an ongoing effort to address the region's deep-seated poverty.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nDinolfo say she'll be a problem solver\nBut even in these areas, they differ on the details. And on other topics, they are miles apart.\nDinolfo and Frankel come from very different backgrounds in public office. They offer distinct approaches to stabilizing the county's finances, providing child care subsidies to working families and shepherding business development.\nIf Green Party candidate Rajesh Barnabas seems to offer a more stark contrast to his opponents, that's by design. He says he's in the race to raise new and different ideas, and indeed, you won't find another candidate proposing a voter referendum on creating a county-wide public school system.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nFrankel vows to 'clean up county'\nBottom line: The old cliche that all politicians are the same is demonstrably untrue in this race.\nYet by many measures, this has been a quiet election year. The county executive candidates spent about $114,000 combined on the race between July and September. Back in the 2011 county executive race, the Republican candidate alone spent more than twice as much money during the same three-month period.\nComparatively sleepy though the race may be, the outcome is important.\nFor the first time in 12 years, the county executive seat is up for grabs with no incumbent in the race. Republican County Executive Maggie Brooks is term-limited and could not run for re-election.\nWhoever wins, someone new will occupy the county executive's office in January. That means a new leader setting priorities in the county's massive $1 billion budget, managing social programs that have become political hot potatoes in recent years and appointing department heads who oversee public health and safety, parks, sewage and other services that affect county residents on a daily basis.\nWhomever you choose, make an informed decision.\nDRILEY@Gannett.com\nThe job\nWhat it entails: Acting as the chief executive officer and administrative head of county government.\nTerm: Four years.\nSalary: $120,000.\nTerm limit: No more than three consecutive terms.\nResponsibilities: Prepares the annual county budget, which totals about $1 billion this year.\nOversees county spending and the collection of taxes and other revenue.\nSupervises county agencies, departments and properties; appoints department heads.\nCarries out and enforces actions of the County Legislature.\nNegotiates and executes contracts on the county’s behalf, as authorized by the legislature.\nPerk: Has the power to veto county legislation.\nDrawback: Is required to show up to every County Legislature meeting.\nVoice of the Voter\nDemocrat Sandra Frankel, Republican Cheryl Dinolfo and Green Party candidate Rajesh Barnabas will participate Monday in a Monroe County executive debate hosted by Voice of the Voter.\nThe debate is from 8 to 9 p.m. and will air live on AM 1370 and WXXI-TV, and will stream on DemocratandChronicle.com , WXXI.org/news , 13wham.com and wdkx.com .
