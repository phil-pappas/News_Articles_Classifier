Along with the Lufthansa heist, they say he and the late mobster James Burke killed a truck driver in 1969 after becoming convinced he was an informant. \nRobert De Niro played a character based on Burke in the 1990 Martin Scorsese movie.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:44:12.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
