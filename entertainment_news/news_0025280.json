Luckily, we don't get too much time to dwell on that feeling because we're so busy, but every once in a while... you know?\"He continued: \"I remember when Bruce and I came onto the project. A few weeks later we pitched a pretty new story to the team, kind of like a new direction for the project.\"A lot of things were pretty rough and just slotted in, so there was an ending but it wasn't as well defined, and at some point we defined more of the [plot] thread and a more definitive ending, and we did a second pitch for the team.\" © Sony Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is scheduled to launch for PlayStation 4 on March 18, 2016, and fans will be able to partake in its multiplayer beta later this year.The upcoming sequel is set three years after the events of Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception and revolves around Drake's older brother Sam, who reappears seeking his younger brother's help.Everything we know about Uncharted 4, including release date, trailers and gameplayCheck out our most anticipated games of October, one of many videos in Digital Spy's dedicated Gaming YouTube channel.
