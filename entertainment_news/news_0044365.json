An anti-corruption campaign by Beijing was also seen as prompting Chinese billionaires to become less showy.\nThe Artprice report also showed that the top living contemporary artist in the United States is no longer Jeff Koons, but Christopher Wool, whose works -- the best known of which feature stencilled-letter phrases squeezed together -- are now fetching twice what they were a year earlier.\nWhile contemporary art auctions can hit stratospheric numbers north of $10 million per work, there is still scope for buyers with shallower pockets to get a piece of the action.\nAccording to Ehrmann, \"64 per cent of sales through auction are lots going for less than $5,000\".\nEven though contemporary art represents just 13 per cent of the overall art market, \"it is now an engine for the world art market\" because of heightened demand by a growing number of museums, he said.\nRelated Stories 'Most valuable art collection ever' on show in Hong Kong", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T22:18:04.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
