Eihito Tsuboi said the 2011 disaster, which was the largest nuclear disaster since Chernobyl, continues to have a significant impact on nearby communities.\n\"The world has to know what's going on,\" Tsuboi said through a translator.\nTsuboi is trying to raise money to give clean water to people living near the plant and to create a campground where people can move to get away from the dangerous area. He said there are hundreds of thousands of children living close enough to have short or long-term health effects from the radiation.\n\"The children there need our help and the government is not doing enough,\" said Tsuboi, who started the nonprofit Fukushima Inochinomizu to help.\nPastor Yugo Kubari of the Chicago Japanese Mission Church in Arlington Heights said people can donate to his church or the Baptist Foundation of Illinois to help.\n News Arlington Heights Charities and Fundraising Newsletter", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share", "http://baptistfoundationil.org/", "http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-japan-fukushima-recovery-20141119-story.html"], "published": "2015-10-09T01:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:22:02.782+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
