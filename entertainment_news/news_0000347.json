It's not like he's saying it to an 11-year-old. I'm 21 years old,' Justin responds to his dad's comment on his viral nude photos. \nJustin Bieber wasn't surprised by his dad Jeremy Bieber's comment on his viral nude photos taken during a vacation in Bora Bora. The \"What Do You Mean?\" singer told host Zach Sang on the \"Zach Sang & The Gang\" radio show over the weekend that his dad's comment was hilarious. \"I thought it was hilarious. 'What do you feed that thing,' he said,\" Justin said of his dad's comment posted on Twitter which was soon removed. Of whether or not the singer was embarrassed by his dad's comment, Justin said, \"No. It's such a dad thing to say.\" The 21-year-old singer also defended his dad against people who slammed him for being proud of Justin's penis size. \"When I found out people were hating on him for saying that, I was like, 'Are you kidding me?' \" Justin said. \"What dad wouldn't be proud of that? It's not like he's saying it to an 11-year-old. I'm 21 years old.\" Justin admitted that he's no longer thinking about the nude photos though he intially thought it was an invasion of his privacy. \"At the end of the day, the photos, they're not terrible! But, honestly at first and before the reaction was what it was and still with the reaction,\" he revealed. \"I still felt like I wanted to keep that part for me. You know? I was never - but I felt like it was a little bit of an invasion of privacy... And when I first found out about it, I was like... my heart sank.\" The \"Baby\" hitmaker also revealed that his fans gave his penis a name. \"They call it Jerry,\" he said. When one of the hosts said that the name was supposed to be \"Big Jerry\" because of the size, Justin looked shy and said, \"Thank you, dude. I guess.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T06:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:31:01.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
