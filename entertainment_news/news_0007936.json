Another monthslong investment of time, money and emotion down the tubes. Cub losses had become so routine that, despite all of the assurances that things were on the precipice of change, I went into the offseason once again dejected and discouraged.\nEven by Cub fans standards, enough was enough.\nAt the beginning of the 2015 season, my husband said, \"We're not buying tickets in advance this year. We're just throwing money away.\"\nAs so often happens whenever we make a blanket statement about what we are going to do (exercise more) or not going to do (eat pizza every Friday), the opposite happens.\nIt began in April. I got word that a co-worker was selling two tickets to a Tuesday night game against the Reds. The Cubs were playing well, the weather forecast was good and I had a hankering to see the new jumbo video board.\nI did some arm twisting on the homefront: \"Let's just go to one game and see how we feel,\" I suggested.\nWe thought the screen was too big, dwarfing the real players and making them look like foosball characters. We also thought the outfield seating looked sad as it underwent construction. And the Cubs lost 3-2.\nCubs' Jake Arrieta blanks Pirates, division series with Cardinals next Mark Gonzales They celebrated like wild fraternity brothers Wednesday night.\n\"We have a special group,\" rookie Kyle Schwarber said after supporting Jake Arrieta's latest mastery with a two-run homer and three RBIs. \"We have great personalities and great leadership top to bottom.\"\nFrom the strategy of manager...\nThey celebrated like wild fraternity brothers Wednesday night.\n\"We have a special group,\" rookie Kyle Schwarber said after supporting Jake Arrieta's latest mastery with a two-run homer and three RBIs. \"We have great personalities and great leadership top to bottom.\"\nFrom the strategy of manager...\n(Mark Gonzales) Still, as we exited the stadium, I felt an odd sense of hopefulness. I mentioned this to my husband, who agreed that something seemed different. We immediately attributed it to April. Hope springs eternal and all.\nNevertheless, the next day, we got on the Internet and bought tickets to another game. A few weeks later, my season ticket holder colleague offered more tickets.\nIt all seemed to happen in a whir, but between buying up other fans' tickets and buying some on our own, we ended up going to more games this year than ever in our decades of fandom.\nWe took my dad to a game. We took some college friends who were visiting from out of town to a game. We went with my cousin and her husband to a game. We were there for the very first fireworks show at Wrigley Field on the Fourth of July. And we were there the day Fergie Jenkins signed autographs.\nWe cheered on wins and brushed off losses. And never once thought about the postseason. We just enjoyed the ride. Like old times.\nThirsty Sox fans hope for many Cardinals homers Steve Metsch In the heart of Chicago's 19th Ward, where Paul Konerko, Frank Thomas and Chris Sale form a sort of Holy Trinity, there's not much Cubs love to be found.\nThis is White Sox Country, a place where the South Side team takes precedence even when the Cubs, that team from the wrong side of town, is having...\nIn the heart of Chicago's 19th Ward, where Paul Konerko, Frank Thomas and Chris Sale form a sort of Holy Trinity, there's not much Cubs love to be found.\nThis is White Sox Country, a place where the South Side team takes precedence even when the Cubs, that team from the wrong side of town, is having...\n(Steve Metsch) Even though others talked up the Cubs' wild-card chances, their impressive showing in a super tough division and the continued awesomeness of Jake Arrieta, I was simply determined to hang on to the moment. I wanted to feel baseball the way I did when I was a kid, when I truly loved it one game at a time. Maybe if we stopped betting on the future we could return to enjoying the present.\nAll season long, we tried to stay that course, whether they won or lost, and we never once let ourselves be fooled into thinking they'd make the playoffs.\nAnd then they did. And here they are, in a battle with the St. Louis Cardinals, with the winner getting a spot in the National League Championship Series. And they're looking great.\nDespite the oddball aligning of game dates and times that people think are a sign the Cubs will prevail, and despite the \"Back to the Future Part II\" premonition (Or is that hindsight?) that the team goes all the way, I am still taking it one game at a time.\nI have to admit, though, this year everything seems different.\nIncluding Sox fans.\nAnyone who follows baseball in divided Chicago knows there is a price to be paid for your allegiance, especially if you live \"on the wrong side of town,\" which we do.\nThe last few times the Cubs skirted success, the blowback from White Sox fans was intense. Taunts, jokes, even cursing — and not the kind accompanied by a goat.\nSo I was braced for it again. Especially in this day and age, when everyone has easy access to texting, Facebook and Twitter, and when there seems to be no shortage of hate to spew upon everything from politics to religion, I expected to be slammed with mean-spirited messages.\nBut that didn't happen. Sure, there was the occasional blurt of \"Cubs (stink),\" which, for obvious reasons, showed the sender's lack of imagination.\nFor the most part, though, the response to the Cubs' success this year has been kind, mature, even genuine.\nMany years ago, I worked with a guy named John Stroud, of the famous \"We are Strouds and, as such, die-hard Sox fans\" clan. I took a lot of heat in those days from John and Co. \"Brutal\" kind of sums it up.\nSo imagine my surprise when I found this in my inbox recently:\n\"Hi Donna,\n\"I am still a diehard White Sox fan, but again our season has ended. I just wanted to drop you a note to wish your CUBS good luck in the playoffs. Twenty years ago I never would have done this. Hell, ten years ago I would not have done this either. There was a better team on their way to a World Series Championship, The Chicago White Sox. Since then I have been a more open person and have openly stated to friends of mine, that are CUB fans that I hoped in their lifetime they were able to experience the joyous feeling I was able to enjoy in 2005 when we won the World Series. I'll never forget that night in 2005 as I sat in my den and actually shed tears of joy as our team celebrated on the field.\"\nThat very same day, a good friend who is a lifelong fan of the South Siders texted me wishing the Cubs well. Of course she warned me not to tell anyone, that she'd deny it in a court of law, but that's OK, your secret's safe with me, Kath.\nThere have been other expressions of compassion, too. Facebook friends who follow the men in black have messaged, wishing \"my\" team well.\nOther Cub fans have experienced the same random acts of unexpected kindness. A cousin asked his sister, a loyal Cub fan, if he could jump on the North Siders' bandwagon this year.\nNic Mitchell, of Lockport, grew up in a house divided. Over the years, he taken a lot of heat from his Sox fan brother. He's taken some this year, too.\n\"But there have been quite a few that have shown support. Or at least indifference, which is better than spite, I suppose,\" he said.\nDanny Gonzalez, who owns Rockwelz Bar Meets Grill in Orland Park, said, \"Both teams have been so bad for so long that I think Sox fans are just happy someone's winning.\"\nCould be. My thinking is this: If these young Cub players can overcome a century of curses, pity parties, close calls and ridiculous excuses to lead their team into a division playoff series, surely Cub and Sox fans can co-exist without all the pummeling.\nTony Mantesano, who co-owns the Old Tinley Pub and Eatery in Tinley Park, said White Sox fan kindness might just be acknowledging the obvious.\n\"Maybe they just know a good team when they see it,\" he said.\n\"A lot are admitting they can't take away from this team,\" he said, noting the Cubs' \"spectacular manager, the good bats and the good starting pitching.\n\"They can't take away from what the Cubs are doing,\" he said.\nOf course, support is not 100 percent. There's a certain bar in the Mount Greenwood community in Chicago that I suppose considers itself old school and is giving away free beer every time the St. Louis Cardinals homer off the Cubs in the playoffs.\nBut, Mantesano said, \"So what? We're giving away free hot dogs and apple pie at every game the Cubs are in.\"\nNo spite, no put-downs, no opposing team venom. Just the same kind of good old positive support that has gotten the guys in blue where they are today.\nThat, he said, is \"the American way.\"\ndvickroy@tribpub.com\n@dvickroy\nCopyright © 2015, Daily Southtown Chicago Cubs Chicago White Sox St. Louis Cardinals World Series National League Championship Series Cincinnati Reds", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56166090/turbine/ct-cubs-win-wild-card-report-pirates-spt-1008-20151007", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56172acb/turbine/ct-sta-mcnallys-jabs-cubs-st-1009-20151008", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561abda0/turbine/ct-sta-vickroy-cubs-love-st-1012-20151011"], "published": "2015-10-11T22:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:33:47.342+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
