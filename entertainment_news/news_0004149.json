The photos give a look at the filming location where a gigantic skull was spotted. There has been a speculation that the skull belongs to one of the titular monster's ancestors. They're not calling it Skull Island for nothing. pic.twitter.com/1Zmd0K82Te — Reel Tours Hawaii (@reeltourshawaii) October 11, 2015 Dug up another \"Kong: Skull Island\" set pic. Filming starts Monday! pic.twitter.com/Lcmc2xMA2e — Reel Tours Hawaii (@reeltourshawaii) October 16, 2015 Besides, there is a photo of Samuel L. Jackson , Corey Hawkins and Jason Mitchell along with other cast and crew members gathering on the set of the movie. Jackson then took to Instagram to tease fans with a behind-the-scenes photo. The picture shows himself in front of an old helicopter. The actor is seemingly learning to navigate the vintage vehicle. \"Bout to learn to drive some new/vintage s**t! Fun Fun Fun!!\" he captioned the photo. Are you ready!? I'm definitely getting a 1970's Vietnam vibe on this film. #Kong #SkullIsland #oahu #samueljackson pic.twitter.com/e5NJ7U4vH6", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T08:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:16:55.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
