Don Chingon, in Brooklyn NY, is offering customers 10% of the restaurant if they can finish their challenge meal.\nIn order to qualify and win, they have to finish off a 30-pound burrito AND a Ghost Pepper margarita, all within one hour and without stopping for a break or (ew) letting out any bodily fluids.\nThat might seem doable, even if you're starving, but the current record for eating a giant burrito stands at 14 lbs., so this is nearly double that.\nThe restaurant, as you can imagine, has a clause in the contract that prevents anyone from suing them if they should die or be struck with illness in the course of the challenge. What's more, you'll have to pay $150 for the honour of attempting the challenge in the first place.\nVia FoodAndWine.com\nMORE: Watch: Aussie teen makes epic Snapchat story after he's left home alone for the weekend\nMORE: Watch: Surfer has incredible close encounter with whale in California\nMORE: Watch: These pick-up lines from around the world are so atrocious it hurts", "external_links": ["http://www.foodandwine.com/fwx/food/want-own-restaurant-you-just-have-eat-first"], "published": "2015-10-10T23:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:00:48.449+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
