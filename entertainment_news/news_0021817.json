Paisa Vasool Film. Fantastic Action Stunts, Music & #RamCharan Star Power. ☆☆☆☆\", she tweeted this morning. \nIn the past, Kiaara reviewed Telugu biggies like Baahubali, Srimanthudu and Rudramadevi. However, she had to face the ire of Telugu movie lovers for bashing Baahubali very badly while she caught the attention of Mahesh Babu fans for giving 5/5 stasr for Srimanthudu . \nBut we doubt the authenticity of Kiaara reviews since none from the industry acknowledged her till now. Nevertheless, let us hope Bruce Lee matches up to the expectations and Kiaara's talk comes out to be true.
