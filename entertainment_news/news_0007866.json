Desrosiers, head of the coastal advocacy organization One Hundred Miles, along with the Fayetteville-based One More Generation, have supported Tybee Island's efforts to ban single-use plastic bags. By KELLY QUIMBY Environmental groups from across the state of Georgia are joining together to support a proposal they hope will reduce the number of plastic bags distributed on Tybee Island.\nLed by the Coastal Georgia environmental conservation group One Hundred Miles, some half-dozen organizations have pledged to contribute to the purchase of 30,000 reusable bags for Tybee’s businesses.\nThe plan is to introduce the reusable bags in conjunction with a proposed ordinance to ban plastic bags on the island. In May, Tybee officials voted to postpone a second reading of the plastic bag ban proposal for four months.\nThat deadline has come and gone, and in the meantime, city officials have expanded their scope to develop a litter reduction program for all sorts of trash.\n“We are consolidating the information that came to us during the (litter) stakeholder workshop that we had two or three weeks ago, and we hope to have all of the suggestions and input that we got from citizens and business owners in a workable format that we can use,” said Tybee Councilman Paul Wolff. “We’re not going to do anything in terms of passing the second reading (of the bag ban) until we have had time to review that data and bring it back to the stakeholders.\n“I still think a plastic bag ban may be part of the solution, but we don’t want any laws that wouldn’t prove useful. The overall problem is dealing with litter, and we’re going to take a holistic approach and look at all the options.”\nIn the meantime, those participating in the bulk purchase of reusable bags hope they can have them available if and when the proposed plastic bag ban goes into effect.\nMegan Desrosiers, executive director of One Hundred Miles, pointed out in the announcement that the prevalence of plastic bags comes from their affordability. While paper bags average between a nickel and 23 cents each, plastic bags typically cost between 3 cents and 5 cents.\nIf the groups can raise enough money, however, they can buy the reusable bags in bulk at an affordable price. Currently, the online fundraising campaign set up by the conservationist groups has raised about half of its $10,000 goal.\n“The idea for donating bags came from conversations with Tybee residents who are concerned about the impact a plastic bag ban would have on businesses who rely on tourists for the majority of their income,” Desrosiers said in an email. “Tourists almost never bring their own bags with them on vacation. We will work to make sure that our bags make it into the hands of people who visit Tybee Island.”\nFor more information on the effort to collect money for the purchase of reusable shopping bags for Tybee Island, call 912-264-4111, or go to www.crowdrise.com/reusablebagsfortybee/fundraiser/onehundredmiles.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14811849.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14811849.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-18T16:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T14:11:23.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
