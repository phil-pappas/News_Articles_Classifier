He hijacks the film. \nThe source material, Isaacson's sprawling work that was being written even as Jobs lay dying of pancreatic cancer, is a traditional biography. But Sorkin has chosen to present the story in three acts, each centering around a product launch in the center of Jobs' short life - the original Macintosh in 1984; the introduction of the NeXT computer in 1988 after Jobs' firing from Apple; and the iMac in 1998 after his triumphant return. It has the feel of a stage play, driven by the writer's trademark breakneck dialogue and ponderously meaningful soliloquies. \nIn theory, Sorkin's operatic style should be tailor-made for Jobs' larger-than-life persona. But Sorkin's script reduces Jobs' personality to two facets. There's brilliant but abusive friend and boss, and the initially callous, uncaring father who denied his first daughter's existence but eventually came to love her. When the movie ends, you don't feel you know very much about either of those sides, much less all that you have not been shown. \nWe don't see, for example, just what made Jobs the inspiring leader that he was. We see Jobs, played with force and tempestuousness by Michael Fassbender , berating employees, but we have no idea why they put up with it. \nWe don't see Jobs getting sick from cancer, hiding that fact from his company's shareholders and lying publicly about it. \nWe don't see Jobs under pressure to finish touchstone products as his mortality approaches. We don't see the struggle of a genius racing against time, of a control freak losing the ultimate battle for control. \nAnd though we do see Jobs struggling to be a decent human being with his first daughter, we never see his family - wife Laurene Powell Jobs and his three children with her. Powell Jobs reportedly tried to get the movie shut down, with the Hollywood Reporter recently reporting that she had called actors Christian Bale and Leonardo DiCaprio , urging them not to take the starring role. \nWhat we end up with is a movie that, to a certain extent, cheats its audience. Oh, what could have been. \nThis is not the fault of the cast, though the performances are uneven. Fassbender looks nothing like Jobs but masterfully projects his essence, if not his charisma. When he interacts with the three actresses who play his daughter Lisa, we see the conflict between the man who demands control and the father who wants to let go of his heart. Fassbender gives us the fury of Jobs betrayed in a dramatic boardroom scene in which he's kicked out of the company he founded, and the tenderness of finally realizing how to love his own child. \nKate Winslet may outdo Fassbender as Joanna Hoffman , seen here as almost a Girl Friday but who in truth was a key part of the Mac's original marketing team. She plays Jobs' foil and conscience, nudging him to do the right thing, both in terms of his interactions with his staff and his relationship with Lisa. \nThe most disappointing character is Seth Rogen as Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak . He comes off as whiny and a little slow. Having met Wozniak, I can say he's anything but. \nApple executives who worked with Jobs and have seen the movie have said it really doesn't reflect the person they knew. When I first read that, I chalked it up to either friends being protective of Jobs' legacy or Apple putting its PR spin on things. But having seen \"Steve Jobs,\" I know exactly what they're talking about. If you come to this film hoping to get a thoughtful look into a complex man whose obsessions changed the world, be prepared to come away disappointed.
