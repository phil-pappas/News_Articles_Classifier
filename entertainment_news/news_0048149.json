But she's brought a whole host of scary, unexplained lesions on her back. ( Grey's , as ever, does not give a fuck about whether you're trying to enjoy a delicious meatball sub while you watch.) Bailey orders her into isolation while tests are run, which gives Jackson plenty of time to show up and stare balefully at her through her bubble. She takes being in isolation rather poorly, and ultimately pages Jackson 911 so that they can have it out. It's a hard fight to watch, because both April and Jackson are right. Jackson can't believe that April left. April can't believe that Jackson gave her an ultimatum. Ultimately, she says she's willing to pull them through the muddy work of their marriage. He's pretty sure they're not worth fighting for. I'm pretty indifferent about Japril as a pair, but it's still hard to watch. I'm mostly interested to see what April's \"fighting for their marriage\" looks like — and am hopeful it'll be more than typical \"win him back\" shenanigans.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below Meanwhile, it's Chief (!!) Bailey's first day on the job, and she's already so efficient that she's canceled the party held in her honor. Grey's takes a lot of undeserved \"That show is still on?!\" heat for many reasons, but especially because building a character over the course of 12 seasons allows us to see a fascinating amount of character growth. What I love about Bailey is that she's always been singularly determined, deeply fierce, and deeply feeling, but those traits have, in the past, worked against one another. Now, she's more secure, a bit more relaxed, even smarter, and somehow both harder and softer, all of which make her an even greater force to be reckoned with than the \"Nazi\" we met way back in 2005.\nMore From Cosmopolitan And as an unplanned bonus, there's a very special patient on Bailey's very special day — Jade, an incredibly tall woman (one of the interns assures us she's \"taller than Lebron\") with a pituitary tumor.\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail ABC There's a running metaphor throughout the episode that suggests that Bailey is to the hospital what a pituitary glad is to the human body, and while some of the voiceover moments on Grey's draw overly forced parallels, this one actually kind of works. Jade's a project manager for a team bringing the Internet to remote parts of Africa and says she simply can't make time for the surgery, which Bailey (of course) takes as a personal challenge. There's a great \"Avengers assemble!\" scene where Bailey explains what she needs from the other doctors and exactly why she and Jade need it. Then everyone looks at scans to a peppy cover of \"Since U Been Gone.\"\nJo's working on Jade's case, too, alongside two of the new interns, who we'll call Douchebeard and Babyface. (I have a difficult time remembering the new interns' names, due to a rare, incurable syndrome I have called The Last Time I Learned The Interns' Names They All Died.)\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail Babyface and Douchebeard. ABC Babyface has a crush on Jo, which is hilarious because he does not even have the slightest idea how to speak to a woman, let alone flirt with one. Then everyone gets mad at Bailey and she has a very quick panic attack in a stairwell, then cries, and then gets determined, which is awesome news, because you can have Olivia Pope all you want, but when I want something handled, give me Determined Bailey any day. She gets vulnerable, tells the surgeons how much she appreciates them and how extraordinary they are, and promises to do better tomorrow. And she does, starting with making Meredith the chief of general surgery. I'd joke about how that's basically a punishment, especially for a widowed mother of three children under 5, but it's a nice acknowledgment of their shared history to hear Bailey say, \"You are the calm in the center of the chaos. You have been since I met you.\"\nThere's also a long-running subplot about Webber feeling left out/not thanked enough/etc. when Bailey turns down the big party he'd had planned, and it's a little insufferable, but you know what? God bless Grey's for flipping the gender script and having an entire storyline devoting to a dude overanalyzing and wringing his hands and generally being a baby for once.\nMeanwhile, Amy's still fretting over what to do with Owen, and so she asks Callie, \"Have you ever had a friend who's, like, a really good friend, but you just want to make out with them all the time?\" Callie says yes, that was something she did for years. Amy asked what happened, and Callie sort of laughs and says, \"Sofia.\" I live for peppered-in references to old-school Grey's and I'm already obsessed with how frequently this season references Callie's bisexuality in a matter-of-fact way, so it's a very nice moment — and against all odds, Amy and Owen really do seem well-matched. And speaking of nice throwbacks, to the tune of \"Shake it Off,\" they finally start making out in (where else?) the elevator. It's been a while since someone pushed that emergency stop button … and only on Grey's is that not a euphemism.\n​Follow Lauren on Twitter .", "external_links": ["http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/768x383/gallery-1443795444-screen-shot-2015-10-02-at-101624-am.png", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/640x320/landscape-1443795444-screen-shot-2015-10-02-at-101624-am.png", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1443795295-screen-shot-2015-10-02-at-101351-am.png", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/640x319/gallery-1443795444-screen-shot-2015-10-02-at-101624-am.png", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/640x325/gallery-1443795295-screen-shot-2015-10-02-at-101351-am.png", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/768x390/gallery-1443795295-screen-shot-2015-10-02-at-101351-am.png", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/480x239/gallery-1443795444-screen-shot-2015-10-02-at-101624-am.png", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/480x243/gallery-1443795295-screen-shot-2015-10-02-at-101351-am.png", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/640x320/landscape-1443795295-screen-shot-2015-10-02-at-101351-am.png", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1443795444-screen-shot-2015-10-02-at-101624-am.png", "https://twitter.com/L_Hoff?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/980x498/gallery-1443795295-screen-shot-2015-10-02-at-101351-am.png", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/980x489/gallery-1443795444-screen-shot-2015-10-02-at-101624-am.png"], "published": "2015-10-02T18:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:43:31.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
