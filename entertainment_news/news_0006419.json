When Ian decided to leave, we thought about all the different scenarios, but felt a sudden death would have the most impact and would produce many new stories with a lot of potential.\"Asked whether a happier ending for Howard and Emma had been considered, he replied: \"Of course we talked about it, but whether the relationship would've survived the miscarriage, I'm not so sure.\"Emma's had a huge double shock, so the repercussions for her will be hard felt and difficult to recover from. Grief can do strange things to people, but it's more interesting to have her around so we can see how that manifests.\" © BBCEmma was left devastated While it's rare for Doctors to deliver a big on-screen surprise, Lloyd added that it was the best choice to provide maximum impact.He said: \"It takes an awful lot of co-operation from actors, directors, writers and the press! People understand we want it to be a shock, since it's so sudden and unexpected. Spoilers would ruin it for the viewers.\"Doctors continues tomorrow (October 23) at 1.45pm on BBC One when viewers will see how Howard's death impacts on the regular staff at The Mill.Read more Doctors spoilers and newsDigital Spy Soap Scoop video - hit play below for gossip on EastEnders' Halloween special, Nikhil's Emmerdale return, the Nightingale family's arrival in Hollyoaks and a new romance story for Mary in Coronation Street. function onTemplateLoaded(experienceID) { bcExp = brightcove.getExperience(experienceID); modVP = bcExp.getModule(APIModules.VIDEO_PLAYER); modExp = bcExp.getModule(APIModules.EXPERIENCE); modCon = bcExp.getModule(APIModules.CONTENT); modVP.addEventListener(BCMediaEvent.BEGIN, onVideoStart); modVP.addEventListener(BCMediaEvent.STOP, onVideoStop); modVP.addEventListener(BCMediaEvent.PROGRESS, onVideoProgress); } #_containermyExperience4565610458001 { height: 100%; } // InSkin integration parameters: InSkinParams['myInSkin14565610458001'] = { 'srv_SectionID': '', 'srv_SectionIDPlay': '123757', 'srv_Keywords': '', 'plr_ContentID': 'myExperience4565610458001', 'plr_ContentType': 'BRIGHTCOVE3', 'plr_ContentW': 558, 'plr_ContentH': 314, 'plr_NoSkinContentResize': true, 'plr_NoSkinContentW': 618, 'plr_NoSkinContentH': 348, 'plr_NoSkinInSkinResize': true, 'plr_NoSkinInSkinW': 618, 'plr_NoSkinInSkinH': 348, 'plr_ResizeOnHideSkin': true, 'plr_HideSkinOnExternalAd': 'all', 'plr_ShowSkinAfterExternalAd': true, 'cnt_SmartPlayer': true }; // create the InSkin object: var InSkinObject4565610458001 = new InSkin.Base('myInSkin14565610458001'); brightcove.createExperiences(); if (!navigator.userAgent.match(/Android/i)) { InSkinObject4565610458001.init(); ai_type=\"video\"; } Get the Inside Soap magazine on your iPhone or iPad", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:56:25.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
