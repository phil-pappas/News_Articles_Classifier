NBC has ordered a pilot script to the adaptation of 1999's dark drama \"Cruel Intentions\". The Peacock will have to pay a penalty if it decides not to go forward with the project. The film ended with Reese Witherspoon 's Annette leaving with Ryan Phillippe 's Sebastian in a car with her journal in tow. The TV series will follow the couple's son Bash Casey discovering the journal and uncovering the family's secrets at the same time. Per Deadline, the 16-year-old learns of the riches his father left behind for love. In search of answers, Casey will move from Kansas to San Francisco for a scholarship at the prestigious Brighton Preparatory Academy. While there, he'll get thrust into a world of money, sex and corruption. The film's writer-director Roger Kumble and producer Neal H. Moritz will return in some capacity, joined by Lindsey Rosin and Jordan Ross who staged the film's musical parody. Ross is attached to direct should the pilot moves forward as series. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Required fields are marked with *", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:49:29.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
