READ MORE: Congratulations Are In Order For This 'Strictly' Pro \nEarlier this week, it was reported that she had been “overheard” branding the Irish crooner an “old man” with “no chance” of winning this year’s ‘Strictly’, which she has insisted is not the case at all. \nSetting the record straight, Kristina angrily took to her Twitter, where she branded the press reports were “horrible, disrespectful and rude”, adding: “Everyone knows how much we like working together.” \nKristina Rihanoff and Daniel O'Donnell \nAn insider also reveals to The Mirror: “They have such good chemistry and have developed a great friendship.” \nThis isn’t the first time Kristina has been forced to hit out at speculation about her working relationship with Daniel, though. \nWhen this year’s couples were first announced, judge Craig Revel Horwood claimed that Kristina was “gutted” to have been paired with Daniel , having previously danced with stars like Simon Webbe and Ben Cohen, who she is now in a relationship with. \nOnce again, though, Kristina stepped in to defend herself, and Daniel, rubbishing the reports by saying she was actually “over the moon” to have been paired with him. \nThe pair are currently around the middle of the ‘Strictly’ leaderboard, having lasted this far in the competition without landing themselves in the bottom two. \n‘Strictly’ continues on Saturday night, at 6.30pm on BBC One. Close Strictly Come Dancing's Best Ever Routines of   EastEnders' used car salesman Max Branning turned into an overnight sex symbol with this Samba to 'Mambo No. 5' in 2014. It was just a pity his partner lifted the choreography from her stint on 'So You Think You Can Dance?' When Alesha Dixon performed his show-stopping routine on series five, we were convinced she was about to become the next Beyoncé. Instead, she later became the next Arlene Phillips, replacing the veteran on the panel. The Charleston was a fairly new dance to 'Strictly' when S.E.B took it on in 2013. And despite it only being week two of the competition, she and partner Brendan Cole bagged a whopping 36 points for the routine. 2013 champ Abbey wowed the judges with this beautiful waltz in week one of the competition, and brought it back for the final, where they scored a perfect 40 and lifted the glitterball trophy. If you can remember as far back as series two in 2004 (!), you'll no doubt remember this knockout performance from Jill and partner Darren Bennett. We don't think anyone has ever had as much fun as Lisa and Robin Windsor did performing their Samba on the show in 2012. Cazza's Turkish interpretation of the Charleston cemented her as the favourite to win in 2014. She also performed the dance again in the final, which eventually saw her crowned winner. Given the sexual tension in this performance, it's no wonder Kara and Artem Chigvintsev announced they were an item shortly afterwards. Not only did Louis Smith capture a lot of attention with his toplessness, but his dancing was pretty good in this too. Matt went from Dean Wicks to snake hips with his performance of the Salsa in series five in 2007.  Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T10:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T11:16:37.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
