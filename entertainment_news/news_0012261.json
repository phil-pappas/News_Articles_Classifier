I wasn't getting out there and trying to meet anyone. Tony Strugar pictured centre right with Sam Frost and other bachelors in a scene from The Bachelorette. Channel 10 \n\"Since the show I've been getting out, talking to people more and I met her that way. I went on the show to find love and I did. Even though I didn't win Sam, it worked out for the best.\" \nStrugar and his girlfriend even watch the show together. \n\"She has a laugh with it just like I do,\" he said. \n\"When I first told her I was on the show she was like 'What's that?' She's been living in Italy for the past five years and didn't know of The Bachelorette or The Bachelor. Now she loves it; she's into it more than I am.\" \nBefore his elimination, Strugar was invited on a casino-themed double date with Frost and fellow bachelor Davey Lloyd.

Channel 10 \nViewers branded it the show's most awkward moment so far. \n\"You should expect it to be awkward when it's a double date and you're fighting for the same girl,\" Strugar said. \n\"From my conversations with Sam in the house before the date I could tell I wasn't showing the fun side of me. I didn't want to just try to be a fun person; it has to come out naturally. Unfortunately we just didn't' have that connection and that chemistry.\" \nHe tips construction manager Sasha Mielczarek and rope technician Richie Strahan as the show's current frontrunners. \nThe Bachelorette airs Wednesdays and Thursdays at 7.30pm on Channel 10. channel 10", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:21:52.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
