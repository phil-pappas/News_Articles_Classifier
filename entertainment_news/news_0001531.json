Until recently they were called Cubs fans, although now they have passed the title over to fans of the Chicago Bears, who play the Lions on Sunday in what could be a Stoicism faceoff.\nAccording to the Stoics, we have happiness backward. We think we'll be happy if things go our way. Because they don't often go our way, we're usually miserable.\nAs the first-century Stoic Epictetus tells us: \"Don't demand events to happen as you wish; but wish them to happen as they do, and you will be happy.\"\n\"You mean we should want the Lions to lose their fifth straight?\" Billy asked, as only a teenager can.\nThe great Stoic metaphor, I explained, is that we're like dogs leashed to a powerful chariot. When the chariot moves, we have two choices: trot or be dragged. Either way, we end up in the same place. \"What's the point in being dragged?\" I asked.\nHow the Bears fare vs. winless Lions Dan Wiederer With a win Sunday at Ford Field, the Chicago Bears would own their first three-game winning streak since opening the 2013 season at 3-0. The Bears remain underdogs for the sixth consecutive week with the Detroit Lions still a 3-point favorite.

The Bears remain underdogs for the sixth consecutive week with the Detroit Lions still a 3-point favorite. But the Lions’ 0-5 start has also caused quite a bit...\n(Dan Wiederer) Billy is a historian of the game. He reminded me that the Lions' all-time record in the Super Bowl is 0 for 0, that they haven't won a single playoff game in his lifetime and that they've won just one playoff game in my lifetime. He detailed the infamous bad call against Calvin Johnson, the botched interference call that cost us a win in the playoffs last year and the missed call that lost us the recent game against Seattle. He also brought up the sore point that when he was 6 years old, and his father was brainwashing him to love the Lions, they went 0-16 and were, it is widely agreed, the worst team in league history. \"Is this what happiness looks like?\" he asked.\nStoicism, I calmly retorted, is often misunderstood as a loser's philosophy. It's not that we shouldn't bother seeking out victory. We should strive to do the best at whatever activity we find ourselves in, including being a Lions fan. But we should accept that winning and losing are ultimately outside our control. I explained to my son that we should practice the two lessons parents always preach to their children about playing sports: \"Try your best\" and \"It's only a game.\"\n\"Isn't that like Barry Sanders' attitude?\" the budding philosopher suddenly interjected, pointing proudly at the No. 20 on his jersey. \"Even though he was on the Lions, he never got down about how much they sucked. He just did his job and was the greatest running back of all time.\"\nAs the Lions on the field below continued their pursuit of an early first-round draft pick, Billy and I talked of how we should live our lives like Barry Sanders played football. Always striving for our best, we should neither be upset when we lose nor gloat when we win.\n\"Dad, are you telling me all this because you think I'm not enjoying the game?\"\n\"I guess.\"\n\"Are you crazy?\" he said. \"We just saw Calvin Johnson break the Lions' franchise record for career catches. Sure, I wish the Lions would win, but I'm having a great time. Maybe your little Stoic lecture has been more for you than me?\"\nAt this point Dan Orlovsky, the backup quarterback remembered by Detroit fans as the guy who once ran blithely out of the back of our end zone for a safety, threw an interception. Sitting on the other side of Billy, my father, in his blue and silver pullover, shook his head and chuckled ruefully. His worldview is closer to the ancient philosophical school called Cynicism.\nScott Samuelson, a lifelong Lions fan, is the author of \"The Deepest Human Life: An Introduction to Philosophy for Everyone\" (University of Chicago Press, 2014).\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Detroit Lions Chicago Bears Calvin Johnson Chicago Cubs Opinion Arizona Cardinals Ford Field", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562109a7/turbine/ct-go-figure-bears-lions-20151016", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5621af4c/turbine/ct-stoicism-detroit-lions-bears-barry-sanders-perspec-1018-jm-20151016"], "published": "2015-10-16T19:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T06:44:14.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
