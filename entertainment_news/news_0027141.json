The men's national team have missed out on qualifying for the 2016 European Championships, meaning the nation has not qualified for a major tournament since 1998. \nBut the game remains part of the social fabric of Scotland, and most cities, towns and villages have teams that compete at a variety of levels. \nPhotographer Colin McPherson has spent many years visiting clubs across Scotland, using his camera to explore behind the scenes and capture the essence of the game. Now he has an exhibition, called \"When Saturday Comes\", at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh. \nColin took BBC News along to non-league Edinburgh City, to explain why he finds Scottish football so beautiful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:37:24.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
