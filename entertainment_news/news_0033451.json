News that the former L.A. Lakers player gave the 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians' beauty a thumbs up and said, \"Hey, baby,\" before going back to sleep. \nThe insider also claimed he has been taken off a ventilator and is breathing by himself. \nAnother source confirmed he is speaking and functioning, and that his family, including his children, Destiny, 17 and Lamar Jr, 13, with ex-girlfriend Liza Morales, are all by his side at Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas. \nAlvina Alston, a spokesperson for Odom's aunt, JaNean Mercer, told 'Entertainment Tonight' he said, \"Good morning\" to his doctors and when asked if he wanted to see his children, he replied: \"Yes\". \nBut an insider told gossip website TMZ.com that doctors believe it's still too early to tell whether Lamar will be able to sustain breathing on his own, so they plan to go back and forth between a mask and a ventilator before officially deciding to take him off life support. \nThe good news comes just hours after test results showed Lamar's heart function is \"much better.\" \nThe athlete was allegedly found with \"virtually every drug imaginable\" in his body and suffered multiple strokes. brands : Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Entertainment Tonight, E!
