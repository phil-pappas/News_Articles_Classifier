Related Items Cars For Sale \nBRISBANE'S Jarryd James is coming back to North Byron Parklands for Falls Festival 2015-16. \nThe singer songwriter has cemented his music career with last month's release of Thirty One, his debut album. \nAre you still surprised by your success? \nYeah, man. It's not something I expected to happen this year. \nTwelve months ago I was just working and making a little bit of music, and before that, about two years ago, I gave up on music altogether. \nWhy did you give up? \nI just got really over it. I had been trying for about then years and it's so hard in this country to have a sustainable music career in Australia. \nI couldn't do it anymore. \nWhat did you do then? \nI worked in residential care and I looked after young people with extreme needs. Mostly teenage boys from crazy family situations who had been subject to a lot of abuse and trauma. \nSome of their parents were in prison and others had seen their parents being murdered. \nWhat was your big music breakthrough? \nI put my first single, Do You Remember, up online on Soundcloud in January and there was no agenda. In my brain I thought, \"Let's see if people even like this at all.\" \nThen it snowballed from there and I haven't even had a chance to think much about it. \nHow was it to play Splendour this year? \nThat was pretty overwhelming. You can't really anticipate what is going to happen. I had no idea if anyone would even come to my set, and then when I went on stage I couldn't see the end of the crowd. \nIt was so overwhelming. \nMy brain didn't know how to process it. \nI finished performing and then I went back to my trailer. \nI just sat there on the floor for about two hours. \nAt North Byron Parklands at part of Falls Festival Byron Bay, December 31 to January 3.
