The film is an extremely satisfying experience filled with a smart, amusing and compelling story, a great and recognizable cast, and the kind of thrilling action and beautiful visuals you’d expect from this kind of film. \nBased off of Andy Weir’s 2011 novel of the same name, the movie deals with an astronaut who is left behind on the planet Mars during a NASA space mission after being presumed dead. Still alive and left all alone on the planet, astronaut Mark Watney (Damon) must use his brains to survive and find a way to contact Earth for help. Review: 'The Martian' is out of this world \nThis large-budget studio film stars Damon, Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wiig, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Sean Bean, Sebastian Stan, Mackenzie Davis, Donald Glover and more. While the film is a bit longer than normal, running 2 hours and 21 minutes, and the dialogue and plot may get a bit scientific or confusing to some at times, ‘The Martian’ is as good or better than films such as ‘Interstellar’, ‘Armageddon,’ ‘Gravity,’ and ‘Apollo 13.’ \n'The Martian' features a star-studded cast (Photo: 20th Century Fox) \nThe movie covers a long period of time and jumps around from one time and place to another on a continual basis. Not wasting any time, the film opens with a team exploring Mars, who soon has to evacuate and accidently leaves Watney behind. From here, we spend stretches mainly with Watney on Mars, NASA and the people on Earth dealing with the crisis, and the rest of the Ares crew headed back to Earth. The labeling of dates, locations, names, etc. shown in text on the screen assists the audience with helpful information and gives the feeling that this could be a true story. \nOne of my favorite parts of the film, aside from the slightly unexpected comedy, was watching Matt Damon’s character figure out how to survive on Mars for several years. He uses his knowledge as a botanist and mechanical engineer, plus his general curiosity and desperation from being stranded and alone on the planet, and survival and problem-solving skills to grow crops within a self-made artificial habitat. He repairs machines and equipment left over from the mission, figures out how to produce water, creates a way to communicate with NASA, and explores the planet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:50:59.335+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
