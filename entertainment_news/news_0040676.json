Jay McGuiness and Aliona Vilani Jay McGuiness and Aliona Vilani (BBC Pictures) \n“Finally, the blockbuster everyone was waiting for!” cried judge Bruno. “You outdone and out-danced John Travolta! Best dance ever!” \nCraig Revel Horwood gave one of his trademark statements: “That is a level of technique we have never seen ever. Ah-ma-zing!” \nJudge Darcey Bussell said: “I’ve never seen a jive like that.” \n“Dont’ worry about Pulp Fiction, I’ll tell you a fact,” said head judge Len Goodman. “That is the best dance this season.” Kellie Bright and Kevin Clifton Kellie Bright and Kevin Clifton (BBC Pictures) The Force was also with EastEnders star Kellie Bright and Kevin Clifton as they performed a lively Charleston to Cantina Band from Star Wars. Promoted stories \nThe 39-year-old wowed the judging panel and picked up 32 points. Head judge Len said: “Kellie Bright and a Jedi Knight!” Bruno adored the routine: “I could feel The Force, Princess Leia. I loved all the punctuations with the cane work.” \nCraig added: “It was clean, it was tight, it was precise. The cane work was absolutely fantastic.” Ainsley Harriott and Natalie Lowe Ainsley Harriott and Natalie Lowe (BBC Pictures) The celebrity chef’s penguin-inspired cha cha cha to Earth, Wind & Fire’s Boogie Wonderland from Happy Feet was riddled with mistakes. Little wonder it earned only 20 points from the judges.\nJudge Bruno said: “If I had to pick up a penguin, I would definitely pick up you.” Meanwhile, Craig kept it simple: “A cha cha cha dis-ah-ster, darling.” Peter Andre and Janette Manrara Peter Andre and Janette Manrara (BBC Pictures) \nThe bookies’ favourite to win has been knocked off the top of leaderboard this week with 28 points. Peter’s paso doble to He’s A Pirate from Pirates of the Caribbean was suitably dramatic, but it wasn’t his best dance. \nJudge Bruno chided: “You have to retain those lines, you put so much into it and we lost artistry.” Head judge Len cried: “You’re no Sparrow, you’re an eagle, stalking your prey! It was great. I enjoyed it.” Carol Kirkwood and Pasha Kovalev Carol Kirkwood and Pasha Kovalev (BBC Pictures) BBC Breakfast’s Carol and partner Pasha Kovalev opened the show with a quickstep to I’m Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair from South Pacific. \nThe 53-year-old split the judges: “I love the way you come out and just enjoy yourself. A couple of incidents, but you’re always lovely to watch,” said head judge Len. \nJudge Bruno disagreed: “Quickstep is like running on hot coals, you were shuffling on damp sand,” he stated as she scored 17 points. Craig sided with the Italian: “Lame and very lacklustre I’m afraid, darling.” Daniel O’Donnell and Kristina Rihanoff Daniel O’Donnell and Kristina Rihanoff (BBC Pictures) \nSinger Daniel and his partner had a blast with their cha cha cha to Summer Nights from Grease. \nThe 53-year-old didn’t please all the judges: “I would have loved it to be a bit cleaner and crisper,” said former ballerina Darcey. \nBruno agreed: “It was more Danny zucchini than Danny Zuko.” The Irishman picked up 21 points. Georgia May Foote and Giovanni Pernice Georgia May Foote and Giovanni Pernice (BBC Pictures) \nThe former Coronation Street star performed a dreamy rumba to Writing’s On The Wall from Bond movie Spectre. \nThe 24-year-old got Craig’s approval and 27 points: “Your spins are so clean. It could have had a little more hip action. But I absolutely loved it.” \nHowever, head judge Len rebuked new professional Giovanni Pernice: “All that shaking your head, gets on my wick. Too much posturing, posing and larking about. Two openings out and one forward basic does not constitute a rumba in my book.” Helen George and Aljaz Skorjanec Helen George and Aljaz Skorjanec (BBC Pictures) The Call the Midwife actress and partner Aljaz performed a winning foxtrot to Marilyn Monroe’s I Wanna Be Loved By You from Some Like It Hot.\nThe 31-year-old had the judges gushing praise and she collected 32 points. Judge Craig said: “I thought the whole thing was absolutely gorgeous.” \nHead judge Len observed: “Beautiful gliding because you had beautiful feet. Some like it hot, I like it elegant. And that’s what I got.” Jeremy Vine and Karen Clifton Jeremy Vine and Karen Clifton (BBC Pictures) \nThe broadcaster performed a crowd-pleasing Charleston to Irving Berlin’s Top Hat. The audience cheered on the 50-year-old as he kicked his way to his highest score of 24, with judge Craig awarding only three points. \nDarcey said: “What’s amazing is that you tightened everything up! You’re still quite unusual, but fabulously unusual.” \nHead judge Len cried: “It was a touch of Hollywood and a touch of Borehamwood. It’s genius!” Bruno called it “Python-esque” and Craig sneered over the “Bizarre, swivel action.” Katie Derham and Anton Du Beke Katie Derham and Anton Du Beke (BBC Pictures) \nThe broadcaster and Strictly stalwart Anton performed a surprisingly flat cha cha cha to Pretty Woman from the movie of the same name. \nThe 45-year-old’s routine met with universal disdain from the panel, reflected in the score of 20 points. “This is Strictly Come Dancing, not Strictly Come Posing,” huffed judge Bruno. \nCraig agreed: “It was like a bad internet connection for me. It kept stopping and starting. A surprising lack of content.” \nEven Darcey was disappointed: “From your performance last week, I was expecting so much more.” Kirsty Gallacher and Brendan Cole Kirsty Gallacher and Brendan Cole (BBC Pictures) \nTV presenter Kirsty had a bit of a wardrobe malfunction thanks to her tail. But the American smooth to He’s A Tramp from Lady & The Tramp won her some nice comments and her highest score of 23 points. \nHead judge Len said: “In hold, I thought your movement was much nicer. It was an improvement on last week.” \nJudge Bruno agreed: “Much better. Carry on like this.” However, Craig got a bit picky: “Your arms are devoid of emotion and feeling.” Anthony Ogogo and Otlile Mabuse Anthony Ogogo and Otlile Mabuse (BBC Pictures) Boxer Anthony Ogogo and Otlile Mabuse performed a striking paso doble to Survivor’s Eye Of The Tiger from Rocky.\nThe 26-year-old struggled to please the panel, who awarded 19 points. “That was a mish-mash of martial arts,” was judge Bruno’s view. \nFellow panellist Craig sniffed: “It still lacks shaping. It was more a stampede rather than a sweep.” Head judge Len was more sympathetic: “You attacked the dance, well done.” Anita Rani and Gleb Savchenko Anita Rani and Gleb Savchenko (BBC Pictures) \nTV presenter Anita and new professional Gleb performed an enchanting American smooth to Unchained Melody from Ghost. \nThe 37-year-old picked up generally good comments and her highest score of 29. Judge Craig observed: “It did lack finesse and you need to extend your lines. But I loved the clawing across the floor.” Bruno stated: “I love the fact that you were totally committed to the character and the performance.” Jamelia and Tristan MacManus Jamelia and Tristan MacManus (BBC Pictures) \nThe Loose Women star performed a salsa to Heaven Must Be Missing An Angel by Tavares from Charlie’s Angels. The 34-year-old is struggling with the technical aspects so her highest score of 25 points had her in tears. \nCraig noted: “It’s a little bit rough around the edges. This should have a flow and a freedom to it. Getting out the floor spin was a little bit ugly, darling. Keep your legs together if you’re doing a lift, darling!” \nThe public vote is now open and hosts Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman will announce the unlucky two couples facing the dreaded dance-off in the results show. After that, 14 couples will become 13 as another star departs.
