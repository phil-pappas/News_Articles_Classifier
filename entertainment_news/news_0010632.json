The playback singer and composer, who will be performing in Chennai tomorrow, gets chatty with Times of India about his first performance in the city, AR Rahman's influence in his life, and more...\nYour first performance in the city...\nThis is the first time I am visiting Chennai with my group, The Band. Initially, I was under the impression that the southern belt wouldn't be listening to Hindi music. But after a couple of promoters and fans started writing to us, I realised that I have a fan base in Chennai, too. I am quite fascinated by the city's music scene and have heard a lot about Chennai's enthusiastic audience. I am glad that my first visit is for a live performance. I am looking forward to performing in Chennai.\nWhat will you be singing?\nThere will be a lot of surprises. The concert will be a combination of melodious songs and electrifying performances. With an awesome band to support me, I am sure it will be a visual treat for audience. All my hit numbers will be part of the concert. For me, concerts are not just about the individual singer, but the entire band.\nYou've recorded songs in Telugu and Kannada. Any Chennai musicians you'd like to work with?\nIf you talk about music, the first name that strikes you is AR Rahman. The reason I am here today is because of him. My interest and inclination towards music grew because of him. My understanding of Bollywood music began when I heard albums like Bombay, Dil Se... and Taal. So, his music has changed my life. I haven't got a chance to work in Kollywood, yet. But my biggest dream ever, is to work with Rahman.\nThe turning point in your career...\nEveryone knows my struggle, but the turning point was, of course, Sun Raha Hai. But then, people started saying that it became a hit by fluke. People thought I was a one-song wonder. Galliyan was an answer to that notion. I may be a young chap new to Bollywood, but I take my job seriously. Even if it's one hit song a year, I am happy to stay in people's memories for that one song. Also, I am clear about the fact that I am more of a music composer than a singer.\nYou're often compared to Arjit Singh...\n(Laughs) I remember the day I met Arijit, which was during the music launch of Aashiqui 2. We were performing each other's songs and shared a friendly rapport from day one. There is no competition between us. The reason these rumours came about was because both of us are part of the same hit albums. But we gel quite well and share a cordial relationship. I admire his work and he's a brilliant singer. I am hoping to collaborate with him someday, when something good comes by.\nThe event is organised by Chennai-based events agencies Absolute Events, Spice Studioz, Rangeela Rhythms and Diamond Events, in association with the Times of India; tickets are available on leading online sites.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:24:46.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
