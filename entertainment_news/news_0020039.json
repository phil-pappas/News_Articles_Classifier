A winless September – following a five-game losing skid to close last season – had many in the fan base turning their attention to the 2016 NFL draft. The most beaten-down backers openly wondered if the Bears could even reach the three-win mark that USA Today had projected in August.\nNow? Back-to-back dramatic wins over the Oakland Raiders and Kansas City Chiefs have put the Bears on the verge of a perfect October. Their final game before a Week 7 open date comes Sunday at Ford Field against a reeling Detroit Lions team. The Lions are the league’s only winless team and picking themselves back up after being plastered by the Arizona Cardinals 42-17 on Sunday.\nOn the early line, the Bears remain road underdogs. But with their confidence growing and their momentum obvious, it’s not all that farfetched to believe they will storm into the bye week on a three-game winning streak, back at .500 for the first time since Oct. 18, 2014.\nThe Bears, it’s worth noting, haven’t won three games in a row since opening the Marc Trestman era at 3-0 in 2013. Yet there are signs to indicate that this October resurgence is not a fluke.\nHere are three under-the-radar bright spots as the Bears ready themselves to play the Lions.\nThe secondary\nRemember the pronounced struggles second-year cornerback Kyle Fuller experienced in Week 2, targeted and torched repeatedly in that lopsided loss to the Cardinals? Fuller was thrown at seven times in that game, allowing four receptions for 66 yards while also committing a 42-yard pass interference penalty.\nYet Fuller regrouped and has been solid since. Over the past three games, he has been penalty-free and sharp with his assignments. In the words of fellow corner Tracy Porter: “Kyle has been playing outstanding.”\nSame goes for the defensive backfield as a whole. The Bears used a rookie tandem at safety in Kansas City with Harold Jones-Quartey making his first career start alongside Adrian Amos, a fifth-round pick. Still, the Bears did not appear even the least bit vulnerable on the back end.\nHarold Jones-Quartey, Travis Kelce, Kyle Fuller Ed Zurga / AP Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce carries the ball between cornerback Kyle Fuller (23) and safety Harold Jones-Quartey (29) during the first half.\nChiefs tight end Travis Kelce carries the ball between cornerback Kyle Fuller (23) and safety Harold Jones-Quartey (29) during the first half.\n(Ed Zurga / AP) Over the last six quarters, since safety Antrel Rolle injured his right ankle, the Bears have allowed just eight completions for more than 15 yards. Four of those came on passes to running backs or tight ends with two caught in the backfield and another grabbed 3 yards past the line of scrimmage.\nIn other words, if the Bears’ secondary inexperience makes them susceptible, opposing offenses sure aren’t capitalizing.\nAnd nobody on the defense expressed even an ounce of anxiety over playing with a pair of rookie safeties Sunday.\n“We didn’t have a lack of confidence in those guys,” Porter said. “We know at the end of the day we’re playing football. … If we’re constantly communicating with each other, then it just makes the game so much easier.”\nSeveral defensive players have also pointed to the 26-0 loss in Seattle as a turning point, an afternoon where the Bears’ defense felt the cohesion building.\nSaid Porter: “We knew what we had in the locker room. But you can tell the way the guys were coming together. We were playing together. We were rallying behind each other.”\nThe coaching\nJohn Fox carried an energized grin. At his postgame press conference Sunday afternoon at Arrowhead Stadium, Fox acknowledged the collective confidence he’d seen swelling in his team and expressed pride in how deep the Bears dug to turn a 17-3 halftime deficit into an 18-17 win.\n“It’s what’s cool about doing this for a living. You watch a lot of people work hard for something that’s a common goal. And to see it executed on a weekly basis, it beats the alternative.”\nFox chuckled, aware that the “swag” his players had been talking about in recent weeks had shown up in a thrilling comeback victory.\nPhotos of John Fox, the Bears' 15th head coach.\n“That wasn’t really around when I was coming up. I’ve kind of learned that word,” Fox said. “But you can see that confidence and that swagger and just that belief in themselves coming through. And that’s contagious.\"\nFox’s track record of producing quick turnarounds in previous head coaching stints in Carolina and Denver is directly attributable to the positive energy he creates and the trust he is able to attain. Yet beyond that, one of the 60-year-old coach’s greatest strengths has been surrounding himself with sharp and experienced assistants. And throughout the locker room this season, it’s become obvious that Bears players have respected and enjoyed just how well this staff has prepared them for each opponent.\nCoordinators Vic Fangio and Adam Gase were both head coaching candidates this offseason. And it’s becoming clear why. No one was expecting Fangio to be a miracle worker in his first season in Chicago. But there was a hope that his reputation as a candid communicator and relatable teacher would take a horrendous Bears defense and elevate it back toward average. That has certainly happened.\nStatistically, the Bears rank fourth in total yardage allowed (304.6 ypg) to this point. And while, as a team, they are still 28th in points allowed (28.4 ppg), it must be noted that the special teams and offense have each allowed two touchdowns apiece.\nFangio continues drawing praise for his ability to simplify assignments while also allowing players freedom within the system.\nGase, meanwhile, is two years removed from overseeing the highest scoring offense in NFL history with the Broncos. This season, he has been forced to be far more resourceful and adaptable while patching together a unit that has been decimated by injuries. Five opening-day offensive starters have missed at least one game. And last week, with an ordinary receiving corps of Marquess Wilson, Cameron Meredith, Josh Bellamy and Marc Mariani, Gase wouldn’t allow himself any convenient excuses or crutches.\nWith Cutler operating behind a reshuffled line, Gase worked to prioritize the running game while asking Cutler to execute a heavy dose of short passes. In the first three quarters Sunday, only seven of Cutler’s 24 pass attempts traveled more than 5 yards past the line of scrimmage.\nThe Bears worked tirelessly to avoid unfavorable situations, a Gase trademark. While adapting to their personnel and understanding their limitations, the offense simply clawed to hang around. And then when two late clutch drives were needed, the Bears executed.\nTouchdown marches of 88 and 67 yards capped the comeback win.\nVital to Gase’s success has been his ability to connect with Cutler. And Sunday’s win has to rank up there for the oft-criticized quarterback considering how hard he persevered with a second-tier supporting cast.\n“This game's about doing what you're trained to do,” Fox said. “I think sometimes the mindset and the attitude that you have when you step in to a huddle in that situation is critical. And I think Jay's done a good job with that. And our staff's doing a great job of preparing guys – even though they might be different guys each week – getting them ready so there's a confidence level. And you have to have that in those pressure moments.”\nKyle Long and Matt Slauson\nWhen the Bears began the preseason in early August, the first-unit offense was operating with a line that had Jermon Bushrod at left tackle, Slauson at left guard, Will Montgomery at center, Long at right guard and Jordan Mills at right tackle.\nThe only player from that quintet who was in the same position Sunday against the Chiefs: Slauson, who returned to guard after a 74-snap emergency stint at center in Week 4.\nNew to the Bears’ starting O-line since the end of preseason: left tackle Charles Leno, center Hroniss Grasu and right guard Vladimir Ducasse.\nWith so much flux and inexperience up front, it would have been no surprise had the Bears come apart and delivered a series of inconsistent and clunky performances.\nMatt Slauson John J. Kim / Chicago Tribune Matt Slauson protects quarterback Jay Cutler in the third quarter against the the Chiefs.\nMatt Slauson protects quarterback Jay Cutler in the third quarter against the the Chiefs.\n(John J. Kim / Chicago Tribune) Instead, it’s been a resilient bunch with the leadership and tenacity of Slauson paying dividends and Long’s overall toughness becoming an energizing force.\nLong didn’t immediately warm to his shift from right guard to right tackle. But his eye-opening athleticism and his relentless inner-drive have aided his growth. Chiefs outside linebacker Justin Houston, who almost set the NFL single-season record for sacks in 2014, was quiet Sunday with only two tackles and no big plays. And much of that is attributable to Long’s persistence.\nLong took on an assignment against Houston that he admitted was “freakin’ hard” and more than held his own. Heading into the game, Fox acknowledged Long’s growing comfort at right tackle. And while the third-year lineman can be excessively hard on himself, the coaching staff quietly celebrates what he’s becoming as a tackle.\nLong was asked Monday where he’s felt his comfort grow the most since sliding outside to tackle. “I’d say just actually blocking my guy,” he said, only half-kidding. “That was hard at first and it’s still difficult.”\nThe techniques at tackle are coming more naturally. Long’s understanding of the chess match up front is also growing.\nBut is he ready to acknowledge his notable progress?\n“I see progress,” Long said. “But then I see a lot of plays that I’m embarrassed to be in a room with my teammates. (It’s when) I’ll miss a block or something will happen that won’t go well. Then you look down the stretch in games and guys are getting blocked and (good) things are happening. … But I need to be able to do that for 60 minutes.”\nLong also made it clear Monday that this weekend’s trip to Detroit will be missing some of the competitive excitement it had the past two years. Ndamukong Suh, the former Lion, is now with the Dolphins. And the competitive side of Long wishes it wasn’t so.\n“When I have kids or grandkids, one day they’re going to ask me, ‘Who are the guys that I played against?’ And Suh will be right there at the top of the list,” Long said. “While I understand he’s down there at the beach, it’d be nice to see him at Ford Field.”\nPrivacy Policy Chicago Bears Kyle Long Kansas City Chiefs Detroit Lions NFL Arizona Cardinals Ford Field", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561dce27/turbine/ct-blitz-package-bears-secondary-20151014", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561dcd44/turbine/ct-blitz-package-bears-secondary-20151014-001", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561dce2a/turbine/ct-blitz-package-bears-secondary-20151014-002", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560ae1f8/turbine/chi-john-fox-bears-photos"], "published": "2015-10-14T16:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:43:23.335+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
