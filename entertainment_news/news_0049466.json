It’s one of those full circle moments as I did my last day on Beauty And The Beast as Belle and I was driving home and saw stuff reminding me that it was 15 years to the day that I was cast as Hermione,” she said on Nick’s breakfast show. \n“It’s so crazy. It’s more than half of my life,” she added. \nEmma, who has also starred in The Perks Of Being A Wallflower, Noah and The Bling Ring, admitted she considers various elements when it comes to choosing the right films to be involved in. \n“Sometimes I’m really baffled about what to do about a certain project… the right director, right cast, enough money to get it made properly – all of these disparate elements have to arrive at the same perfect moment. Sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn’t. It’s a bit iffy,” she explained. \n“It always feels like a gamble. Sometimes you’ll get all of the perfect elements in place and it still won’t be a good movie. Or you think it might be a disaster and it turns out really well.” Share article \nEmma also revealed how she is working on getting her yoga instructor’s certificate, and joked they could narrate “a whole series of Emma Watson and Nick Grimshaw yoga tapes.” Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T15:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:55:38.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
