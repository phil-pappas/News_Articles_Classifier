The design of the portable typewriter and the advertisements to market such a product revolutionized its time.\n“It is a privilege and an honor to be a part of the lineage of The Blickensderfers,” said Dana Blickensderfer of Provoke Art.\n“It is a very self-reflecting time for me as an artist as I research and study my family lineage, and as I purposefully and subconsciously let it interact and play a major role in my artist journey.”\nDana Blickensderfer’s new body of paintings in her solo exhibition invites and engages the viewer to discover and reassess ideas of communication. By examining closely and utilizing the turn of the twentieth century typewriter engineering in her paintings, Blickensderfer reflects and examines the subject. She reflects on time passing, while de-contextualizing the mechanical object and putting it into contemporary settings, she is thus revealing herself.\nIt is through the search of her personal identity that she then transfers the meaning of the machine as her intimate universe. The subject in her work is dismantled and re-invented and it is through colors and textures that she is exploring such ideas of the animated, the masculine, the feminine, the organic, and the man-made. There is a dialogue constructed between the history of the typewriter and the history of advertising while relating it to her own biography.\nOpening reception is being held on Wednesday, October 14, 2015 from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. Join artist Dana Blickensderfer for the reception with live music, cocktails and art. To RSVP contact 813.340.5596, info@weprovokeart.com or visit: http://danablickensderfer.com/news/flight-of-the-machine/\nIn addition those attending the opening reception viewers will have a chance to see the artists’ painting process from her latest art and film collaboration with Film Director John Fuentes of Fuentes Film Studios.\nThe art exhibition will be open to the public and continuing from October 12 – 19, 2015. Gallery hours or by appointment only at Doxa Design Lab + Gallery located on 777 N. Ashley Drive Suite D2 Tampa, FL 33602.\nArt exhibit list pieces.\nThank you to the following sponsors for their contribution: Provoke Design , LuisX Photography, iBoss Advertising , Provoke Art, and Fuentes Film Studios.\nAbout Dana Blickensderfer\nAn artist mainly working in painting and drawing, Dana Blickensderfer is also the founder of Provoke Art and the co-founder of iBoss Advertising. Based between New York and Tampa (Florida), Blickensderfer draws her inspiration from her personal biography relating to her family legacy: The Blickensderfers. Her most recent series of oil paintings are constructed images portraying the actual typewriter the Blickensderfer from the 1900s. She intertwines images from the actual object, the original advertising and posters of the era creating a kaleidoscope of colors; shifting between figuration and gestural abstraction. Blickensderfer becomes the bridge between the past and the present, the private and the public, the personal and the universal.\nIn 2014, Blickensderfer was the recipient of the Milton and Sally Avery Scholarship Award to study at the New York Studio School. In 2013, she was a finalist of the Olympics Art Competition in Orlando (Florida) and part of the Celebration of the Arts Exhibition curated by the Bay Area Museums directors in Tampa. Most recently, Blickensderfer was selected as the featured artist in the Panache Vue Magazine, February Edition.\nAbout Provoke Art\nIn 2010, provoke art was founded and developed in hopes to make meaningful contributions to the art world, integrating artists’ inspirations of the past and present combined with contemporary artistic genius.\nThe provoke art video projects developed with film directors birthed performance art for Dana and other artists’ collaborations. Blickensderfer is placed painting a live exhibit in select New York City locations. She plans to produce many of these projects in the coming year with provoke art affiliates. This is the epitome of the provoke art movement – to create works that stimulate thought and emotion; provoke connection and interaction with the common denominator being art.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13018644.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://danablickensderfer.com/", "http://ibossadv.com/", "http://danablickensderfer.com/news/flight-of-the-machine/", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13018644.htm", "http://danablickensderfer.com/galleries/flight-of-the-machine/", "http://www.weprovokedesign.com/"], "published": "2015-10-13T12:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:57:37.645+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
