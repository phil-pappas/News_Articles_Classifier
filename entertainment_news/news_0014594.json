Barnes’ new novel, “In the Kingdom of Men,” tells the story of a young woman who is raised in Oklahoma by her fundamentalist grandfather, leaves high school to marry, and relocates with her husband to an Arabian American Oil Company compound in Saudi Arabia. Barnes found inspiration for this novel in the experiences of her aunt and uncle, who lived in a similar compound in the 1960s. Barnes was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for her first memoir, “In the Wilderness: Coming of Age in Unknown Country” and also authored a second memoir and three novels, including “A Country Called Home.” The library has multiple copies to loan of “In the Kingdom of Men.” For more information, call Alexis Rodegerdts, 509-524-4609.
