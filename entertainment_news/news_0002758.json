The regular round of nomination was kicked off with a jodi nominating two others. It was later announced that out of the said jodi, one person will have to sacrifice their safety and get nominated instead for the next round of eliminations. After much debate and discussions these names were thrown around for nominations- Aman Verma, Rimi Sen, Mandana Karimi, Roopal Tyagi and Prince Narula. \nBut the real highlight of the show was the ugly fight between Kishwer Merchant and Roopal Tyagi. It so happened that when it dawned on inmates that the prize money now stands at less than Rs 40 lakh, there were major discussions. Kishwer started getting angry and Roopal though that Miss Merchent was getting all nerves and hyper to gain footage. This led to a massive explosion. Merchent did not stop at that she launched another verbal attack and went on to say that she was trying to prove Salman’s point! ( Bhai had called Miss Tyagi the silent one!) \nModified Date: October 20, 2015 12:51 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:38:54.779+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
