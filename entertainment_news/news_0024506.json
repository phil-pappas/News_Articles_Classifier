But the tall blonde's absence from the reality dance competition has nothing to do with the $75 million lawsuit she filed in response to the 2008 peephole scandal, and she will re-assume her co-hosting duties after she completes coverage of post-season baseball.\nPer Bergeron, actress Leah Remini will step into the sideline reporter's usual shoes as the nine remaining season 21 contestants hoof it during week six, which is scheduled for Oct. 19 on ABC and will feature the couples dancing re-imagined routines from iconic movies and music videos. In a statement to ET, ABC confirmed Remini's role for the Oct. 19 show but left her participation in additional weeks as yet to be determined.\nIt won't be the 45-year old Remini's first time guest hosting in the \"DWTS\" ballroom. She filled the same void in the fall of 2014 as Andrews briefly departed to cover baseball. She initially debuted before show cameras as a season 17 celebrity contestant. Her professional partner, long-time pro coach Tony Dovolani, most recently worked with \"Real Housewives of Atlanta\" alum Kim Zolciak-Biermann, who was forced to withdraw from the competition after suffering a TIA (sometimes referred to as a mini stroke) following the show's second week.\nThe pairs will alive in the hunt for the Mirror Ball Trophy include wildlife conservationist Bindi Irwin and Derek Hough; actress Alexa PenaVega and Mark Ballas; Big Time Rush star Carlos PenaVega and Witney Carson; Backstreet Boy Nick Carter and Sharna Burgess; singer Tamar Braxton and Val Chmerkovskiy; train hero Alek Skarlatos and Lindsay Arnold; singer Andy Grammer and Allison Holker; social media star Hayes Grier and Emma Slater; and celebrity chef Paula Deen and Louis Van Amstel. \"Dancing with the Stars\" airs Monday nights on ABC.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Tom_Bergeron/status/655125809175404544", "http://www.etonline.com/tv/174188_leah_remini_returns_to_dwts_to_fill_for_co_host_erin_andrews/"], "published": "2015-10-17T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:47:52.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
