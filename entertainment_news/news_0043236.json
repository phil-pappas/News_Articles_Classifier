Nothing prepared — no podiums, no microphones, no moderators — simply voters from all ages and races sitting together with candidates/incumbents speaking as if we were all at the dinner table together.\nWe were allowed 12 minutes in each group and then moved on to another group while the candidates remained in their seats for a total of four rounds.\nI arrived with trepidation, but found myself comfortable asking questions and speaking freely in what would normally have been an intimidating situation. This type of “conversation” allowed for an intimate setting for learning and discussing our city’s biggest issues.\nEven Mayor Edna Jackson herself praised Emergent Savannah for this style of discussion. It truly reflected Emergent Savannah’s vision: “Culture. Community. Conversation.”\nI feel that City Council might consider utilizing this method of communication with their constituents for effective decision-making. The more intimate and personal format truly captures the “voice” of Savannah’s citizens.\nSavannah is two weeks away from a historical election.\nThank you, Emergent Savannah, for bringing together voters and candidates in this welcoming “world cafe” Tuesday evening.\nJAMIE SMITH ARKINS\nSavannah\nLetter writer learned a lot from candidate forum\nEmergent Savannah’s innovative “Turning the Tables” meet the candidates event was a breath of fresh air in a busy City Council election season filled with conventional candidate forums and one-minute answers to complicated questions.\nInstead of sitting passively in an audience, attendees had an opportunity to speak and listen to candidates and fellow citizens in intimate conversation circles. I didn’t meet all the candidates there, but I had some interesting conversations and learned a lot.\nKAREN GRAINEY\nSavannah\nWe should consolidate the city, county\nAre you as tired as I am of the endless bickering between our elected officials?\nWhen Chatham County was made up of distinct urban and rural areas, it made sense to have our government divided between the cities and the county. That structure gave each area representation consistent with its residents — city dwellers and farmers.\nNow, with the majority of the area being urban and suburban, does this still work? Based on the long ongoing inability of the city of Savannah and Chatham County to come to a working agreement for our police force, I don’t believe this split form of government serves our citizens well.\nLet us citizens start and demand a vigorous, yet civil debate about consolidating the city of Savannah and Chatham County into one municipal government. We should all have a voice in how this entire community is governed. Segmented government isn’t working.\nIf you agree, call or write your local representative. I’m doing just that today.\nJOHNNY PARKER\nSavannah\nCity should replace historic bulbs\nIt’s great that Georgia Power has replaced its high pressure sodium street lighting with LEDs — all 16,164 of them.\nHowever, what about the city-owned, historic lamp posts in and around most of our downtown squares? While they are certainly more attractive than the “poles” by Georgia Power, their illumination is still the “orange/pink” glow.\nWhen will the city officials follow the lead to LED by Georgia Power, and replace the bulbs in their lamp posts with security enhancing and night sky friendly LED lighting?\nTED J.
