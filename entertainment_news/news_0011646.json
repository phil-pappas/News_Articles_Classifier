Its version of Randy Newman's Mama Told Me (Not To Come) was a No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1970. The group topped the chart again the following year, with perhaps its best-loved recording, of Hoyt Axton's Joy To The World , and in 1972, with Black And White (David I. Arkin, Earl Robinson). \nThe band also recorded songs by Harry Nilsson, Laura Nyro, Elton John and Paul Williams, and enjoyed 21 Top 40 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 overall. \n\"Cory was like a brother in so many ways,\" said Hutton. \"We had been together since 1965 and I am in shock at this sudden loss.\" Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1RWZKeL TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:25:49.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
