Now in its sixth decade of operation, and in the midst of the final stages of selecting its next Music Director, the Board and Executive Director of AYS saw an opportunity to leverage the vast resources within the classical music community that the organization has built up over the last half century. In this spirit, AYS has formed its inaugural Advisory Council, drawing on the talents and insights of leaders in the field, both performers and administrators, who have worked with AYS over the years.\n“AYS is an institution in Los Angeles and our free concerts are a truly exceptional gift to the community. As a result of decades as a change-agent in the field of classical music at-large, both in terms of audience and musician development, AYS is privileged to count upon the support of many industry icons and leaders. This Council formalizes that level of support. We are very excited, and so thankful for the opportunity to work even more closely with our esteemed Council members. ” – Varina Bleil, Executive Director of the American Youth Symphony\n“When I was approached about joining the new Advisory Council for the American Youth Symphony, I knew immediately that I wanted to be involved. I have been performing regularly with AYS since the beginning of my career, and have been consistently blown away by the talent, focus, and precision of these young musicians. I consider it a privilege to support and mentor the next generation; they are the future of classical music.” – Sarah Chang, Concert Violinist\n“I couldn’t be more truthful in acknowledging the role of [AYS] in my musical upbringing and the role [Co-Founder and Music Director Mehli Mehta] played as a teacher and mentor. I have so many of those hours in that rehearsal room imprinted in my memory and his words and actions were powerful in guiding me in those and the following years. I attribute my understanding of the musical world to his early guidance, more than the teachers before or after.\" – Deborah Rutter, President, John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts\nHeralded as “the finest youth symphony on earth,” AYS has been training the best and brightest musicians and sharing free concerts with the community since 1964. Having long been considered a Los Angeles gem, the orchestra is now poised to rise to greater national prominence, with the support of this roster of industry influencers from across the country:\nSarah Chang\nConcert Violinist\nSarah Coade Mandell\nPhilanthropist; Managing Partner, QRMS, LLC; Studio and Orchestral Double Bassist\nRobert Cutietta\nDean, University of Southern California Thornton School of Music\nDeborah Rutter\nPresident, John F.
