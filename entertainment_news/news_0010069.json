The purpose of the EyeCareUniverse.com YouTube Channel is to provide product reviews, updates on discontinued and new products and in depth “how to” product information videos relating to eye care products to better help their current patients as well as potential customers. By recreating its current videos in the native Spanish languages it attempts to reach more viewers.\nChris a partner of Eyecareuniverse.com said “With our ever increasing client base we are very pleased to now introduce our bilingual customer service team and our bilingual YouTube channel, where you will find a selection of not only English speaking videos but now some of our more requested product videos – in Spanish as well.”\nLast week EyeCareUniverse.com updated their informational YouTube channel by adding a Welcome to Eyecare Universe in Spanish as well as its first product review of the Ray Ban 3025 L0205 58mm in Spanish that help visitors see an in depth overview of the Ray Ban Aviator. PJ the Online Marketing Manager for EyeCareUniverse.com said “The reason behind making this video is to help educate Spanish viewers on how to spot real Ray Bans from non authentic ones since english is not their primary language. In today’s digital era the best way to display such information is via online video. We wanted to arm our visitors with the proper knowledge to help them make an educated decision and what better way to do that than by providing actual videos in their native language.” PJ went on to say “In our video series, users will clearly be able to see what to look for in original frames or vice versa so that they don’t have to worry about regretting an expensive purchase they made later on.”\nAt the moment, EyeCare Universe YouTube Channel possesses over 50 videos and they continue to add more each week. The subject matter of these videos are based on product reviews and how to videos. The purpose of the YouTube channel is to better educate viewers so that they can make an educated purchase or even know how to find the perfect frame for their face shape. Other videos that are currently being worked on, will touch on authenticity of the different designer brands to help educate viewers the big difference from cheap knock offs versus official designer sunglasses.\nAccording to the Department of Commerce, losses to U.S. businesses from the counterfeiting of trademarked consumer products are estimated at $250 billion a year. Most knockoffs are of luxury goods carrying a well-known trademark. They are a deliberate attempt at deceiving consumers into thinking they are buying products made by a reputable manufacturer when they are, in fact, purchasing inferior copies. The counterfeiter sets out to make money by deception . . . deliberately assuming the identity of an established, reputable manufacturer. As one can see, the videos that will be housed on the Eye Care Universe YouTube channel will go a long way to help educate users when they are looking to purchase designer sunglasses and designer optical frames.\nAs EyeCareUniverse.com continues to set trends in the online eye care community, they encourage everyone to visit their new website and their new YouTube channel.\nEyeCare Universe is based out of Westchester County, NY and has offices in Manhattan and Mahwah, NJ. The company has been in business online for the last 16 years selling contact lenses, contact lens removers, designer sunglasses, designer optical frames, eye vitamins, contact solution and all things eye care related. The website provides free ground shipping on all orders over $100\nFor the original version on PRWeb visit: http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13023133.htm\nInformation contained on this page is provided by an independent third-party content provider.
