He and his co-host at the time, Tracy Grimshaw, would be replaced by Peter Overton and the ABC's Juanita Phillips, according to an \"ever-growing whisper\". One critic deemed Stefanovic \"way out of his depth\", blaming him entirely for the program's soft ratings.\nKarl meeting a young fan during Today's road trip to Bendigo. Photo: Supplied \nIn hindsight, those rumours seem silly. Stefanovic is now a breakfast TV pro, as is his long-serving on-air partner, Lisa Wilkinson. The pair have grown their show's audience and made impressive gains on Sunrise , though their arch-rival is still No. 1. \nAdvertisement At some point, Karl will leave Today . As TV Tonight wryly notes , the rumours will eventually prove true. \nImagine, though, if Nine had axed Stefanovic back in 2005. They'd have been perfectly justified: he was a bit awkward sometimes, especially when switching between light and heavy topics, and his show was getting thumped by the opposition. \nBendigo locals brave an early start to meet the hosts of Today.

In particular, they have a knack for political interviews that other media follow up on. \nFresh rumours suggest an exhausted Stefanovic is considering moving on from Today . Given the show's importance to Nine, they won't let him go without a fight – or a strong replacement in the wings. \nThe supposed \"tensions\" between him and Wilkinson have nothing to do with it. Yes, they've had the odd barney. But they quickly make up. They actually like and respect each other. \nKarl Stefanovic and his co-host, Lisa Wilkinson. Photo: Supplied \nDespite a shaky start to Stefanovic's new prime time panel show The Verdict , Nine has extended the original five-week run to eight weeks . \nThis is the right move. \nThere's no doubt the show needs some changes. But it's near-impossible to launch a perfect panel program. You can do all the studio tests you like, but a new talk series is a wobbly foal, doing its best while making lots of stumbles. \nThe Project is now one of Ten's best shows: a polished, entertaining and often fresh take on the day's news. It wasn't always so. When it debuted as The 7PM Project in 2009, it was all over the shop. From memory, it had around 17 co-hosts who rushed from topic to topic. The tone was off, the banter was stilted and the audience quickly changed channels. \nBut here's the thing. A news show is not a drama, where you have a whole season in the can by the time you screen the first episode. If something's not working, you have the chance to fix it. \nThat's what Roving Enterprises did with The Project . To its credit, Ten realised that even after a show gets better, viewers need time to find out about it, then change their habits. \nJust a few minutes into the first episode of The Verdict , viewers had already dismissed it in a barrage of snarky tweets. The substance of some had merit: the panel was too shouty and chaotic, everything felt rushed, and the audience \"verdict\" at the end seemed contrived.\nYet few tweeters offered suggestions for improvement. They were the digital equivalent of Alice in Wonderlands' Queen of Hearts, the ill-tempered monarch who decrees death sentences at the slightest offence. Just a hunch, but I suspect some tuned in merely for the dopamine release of seeing their smart-alec observations get re-tweeted a lot. This bunch is also the first to complain that commercial television doesn't run enough current affairs programming.\nI could sit here and write a laundry list of ways to improve The Verdict . But as weary TV producers know, everyone's an expert. Some actually lie about their jobs when they go to parties, lest they get cornered by a tipsy guest who insists the way to fix their show is by appointing Daryl Somers as host, introducing some It's a Knockout! -style biffo, and having Dexter the  Perfect Match robot make wisecracks from the sidelines.\nStefanovic has proven himself before, in the hyper-competitive world of breakfast television. Critics wrote him off almost immediately, but they spoke too soon. It'll be a big job to turn The Verdict around, but it can be done. Let's hope Nine follows The Project's example and listens to their viewers – then gives the show a chance to win them back. \nStefanovic has also expressed his interest in a late show; \"something more entertainment focused, not like The Verdict \", he told The Sunday Mail . \nSuch a program would play to his strengths, including his irreverent humour and interviewing style. Some TV executives doubt the Australian market could support a late-night, Jimmy Kimmel Live! -type show, arguing it would be too expensive. But a weekly variety show, with a good supporting cast and team of writers, could work well. Variety used to be a strength for Nine. There's no reason why a modern variety show couldn't find an audience.\nAnd we might not have to wait long to find out.\nOn Sunday, a Nine insider told Fairfax Media that an announcement about Stefanovic's future is imminent.\n\"Among the annual end-of-year Karl rumours , what is true is that we're sticking with him ... the (contract) negotiations are amicable, there's no pressure from anyone and it's likely there will be an announcement about Karl's future with Nine before the end of the ratings year.\"\nTwitter:  @Michael_Lallo \nmlallo@fairfaxmedia.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T04:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:53:18.373+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
