The authors introduce the \"Big 5\" behaviors designed to accelerate breakthroughs – listening, deferring judgment, reframing, declaring and jumping in.\nThe Innovative Mindset: 5 Behaviors for Accelerating Breakthroughs is filled with real-world examples of innovative behavior by everyone from progressive mayors to insurance company execs to Benedictine nuns. This groundbreaking text helps you identify what you need to do in order to become more innovative and less fearful, and assists in creating a regimen that transforms how you act.\n\"An innovative mindset is the key to a happier, more productive, stronger life in and outside of the workplace,\" says Marcus Buckingham , New York Times bestselling author and founder and chairman of TMBC. \"This book is a great guide for anyone seeking to behave in a way that transcends fear and fuels progress.\"\n\"If anyone can help you change your mindset, it's the team of John Sweeney and Elena Imaretska. Through their work with the Brave New Workshop, they break the barriers of innovation and fearlessness,\" says Harvey Mackay , author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Swim With The Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive .\nContact:\nBrian Bellmont , Bellmont Partners\n(612) 255-1113\nEmail\n releases/new-book-redefines-innovation-the-innovative-mindset-imparts-set-of-behaviors-that-can-transform-how-we-act-300159279.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151013/276590", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=PH27400&Transmission_Id=201510140835PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH27400&DateId=20151014", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151013/276589", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-book-redefines-innovation-the-innovative-mindset-imparts-set-of-behaviors-that-can-transform-how-we-act-300159279.html", "http://johnsweeney.co/books/", "http://pressreleaseheadlines.com/contact?pid=292331"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:35:43.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
