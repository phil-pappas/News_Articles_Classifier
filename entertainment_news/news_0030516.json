The village of Rosemont had filed an eviction suit against bar owner Boomtown Entertainment over back rent, property taxes and sales taxes, and officials wanted the bar out before its Dec. 31 lease was to expire.\nFor safety reasons, Vanni decided to close the country-themed megabar for good at 2 p.m. Thursday, even though attorneys had agreed in court earlier that day the bar could keep operating until Oct. 31.\nHowever, by Friday afternoon, employees had brought back most of the missing items. Others were found in the bar or scattered about the nearby entertainment district and parking garage.\nRosemont police also recovered some items during the course of their investigation, Vanni said.\nMayor Brad Stephens said no arrests or charges are expected.\nSome of the items that were returned or found include autographed Toby Keith guitars, an autographed Duncan Keith Blackhawks jersey, $3,000 worth of validated parking garage tickets, two 7-foot-tall Jack Daniel's plastic statues, Jack Daniel's display wooden barrels and a host stand sign.\nVanni says they're still looking for two American flags that were on display in the bar after being flown in Iraq.\nVanni and his managers were in the bar Friday afternoon taking inventory of food and liquor, as they clean up and prepare to hand over the keys to the village in two weeks.\nHe said they plan to donate $9,600 in dry goods and frozen food, including steaks, burgers, french fries and produce, to a local food pantry.\nSome 170 full- and part-time employees are out of a job and are expected to get their final checks in the mail. Many have gone to social media to express frustration with the bar's management.\nThe Rosemont Toby Keith's is one of several across the country that have closed this year, many for failing to pay rent or taxes. As many as 20 locations had been opened by the Phoenix, Arizona-based chain since 2009, but only two are left. Those are in Michigan and Massachusetts.\nAttorney Audrey Mense, representing Boomtown in court during an eviction hearing Thursday, said individuals in the company have been removed for wrongdoing, and officials are trying to get the company back on its feet.\nBoomtown CEO Frank Capri told the judge by speaker phone he believes his original long-term lease with Rosemont was wrongfully terminated last year by the village and replaced with a one-year lease for 2015.\nVillage officials announced this week plans to replace Toby Keith's bar with another country-inspired venue, a joint venture of Joe's Bar on Weed Street and Lettuce Entertain You's Bub City.\nThe new tenants are expected to tour the 32,900-square-foot bar/restaurant space once Toby Keith's leaves, then make renovations. The new venue could open by next spring.\nRelated Article\nManager: Toby Keith's in Rosemont closed after staff steals memorabilia, liquor Related Article\nTroubled Toby Keith's bar in Rosemont could close Saturday Related Article\nToby Keith's: We've paid our taxes, and we want to stay in Rosemont Related Article\nRosemont tries to evict Toby Keith's bar for back taxes, rent Business News Dining Night Life Rosemont Crime", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-17T15:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T22:03:52.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
