Photo: Vince Caligiuri \n\nDandelion\n133 Ormond rd, Elwood \n9531 4900\nThurs-Sun lunch; Seven days 5.30pm-late \n\nThere's a common misconception that RocKwiz co-creator and judge Brian Nankervis began his career as an audience warm-up guy, a crowd-wrangler who gees up an audience before the cameras start rolling on a TV show. But actually, he's still one of the best warm-ups in the business; he often spends more of his year doing that than he does fronting the popular SBS quiz show.\n\"There was a time when people would say to me, 'You don't want to get pigeon-holed as the warm-up guy' but I've always enjoyed it. It's not always easy, but it's great fun and it keeps you match-fit,\" he says.\nWe're pondering the menu at Dandelion, Elwood's Vietnamese restaurant in Nankervis' stomping ground, as he reels off the programs he's done warm-ups for – everything from the old Bert Newton Show , five years with The Panel , stints on Lano and Woodley and Thank God You're Here among them. This year he's been the warm-up for Lawrence Mooney's Dirty Laundry and he does the occasional one-off gig.\nSweet potato curry with baby corn. Photo: Vince Caligiuri \n\" RocKwiz is sometimes only 12 weeks of the year, so really … I've got a kitchen renovation to pay for!\"\nAdvertisement He genuinely loves it. And unusually, he fell into it when he was an on-screen cast member of the Jimeoin​ show in the mid-'90s; often it's the other way around. \nWhen the show's regular warm-up guy was sick and the producers asked if anyone was up for the gig, Nankervis put his hand up and then really liked it. Even if it is a bit like being the support act?\nBo La Lot, the classic grilled minced Wagyu beef in betal leaves. Photo: Vince Caligiuri \n\"It can be hard – you can't be funnier than the main act,\" he says. \"Basically, you provide the foreplay and someone comes in for the rest of it.\"\nPart of his schtick was using music – old-school style. \"I taped about 15 songs, just the intros, and I got someone on a ghetto blaster to hit play and pause and the audience had to guess what the song was,\" he says. \nPeople loved it.\nCrispy sesame and coconut rice papers with Spanner Crab dressed with coconut, chilli and lime. Photo: Vince Caligiuri \n\"The producer who came into the green room that night is now one of the producers on RocKwiz ; that's kind of where the idea came from.\"\nA music fan since childhood, he can reel off gigs he went to as far back as the 1960s. Although strangely, for someone as into his music as Nankervis – he hoards \"hundreds of thousands\" of records, tapes and CDs – he was never a performer himself.\n\"I started learning guitar, but I think I got frustrated because I was such a fan that ... I heard myself playing and thought I'm never going to be as good as Keith Richards, so I dropped it.\nLakes Entrance baby Silver Whiting, wrapped in banana leaves with Hoi An lemongrass, chilli and turmeric paste. Photo: Vince Caligiuri \n\"I was in a band for a little while… we were called Full House,\" he says. (They also toyed with the name Free Beer). Nankervis was the lead singer, but the band never took off.\n\"Ultimately my voice was a major problem but the other thing was we were 22, 23, and I think … most bands start when they're 16, 17, and spend years and years thrashing it out and doing endless gigs and we were 23…\"\nAs our food arrives – we share green rice fried tiger prawns, sesame and coconut rice papers with spanner crab in coconut, lime and chili, wagyu beef in betel leaves and, on Nankervis' recommendation (\"although everything here is good\"), Lakes Entrance baby silver whiting wrapped in banana leaves and turmeric paste and a sweet potato curry – he reflects. He sees RocKwiz as something he's been working towards since he was a student, mucking about with mates playing music quizzes in share houses and even incorporating it into his curriculum during his six years of teaching primary school.\nThe bill, please. Photo: Supplied \n\"I loved teaching and quickly realised the best way to maintain the attention of the kids was to perform. I wasn't the most well prepared teacher but I was mad on literature so I used to read lots of stories… and I used to do lots of quizzes!\"\nWas he the cool teacher?\n\"Hmm… I think reasonably cool.  I became well-known for these Friday quizzes – they'd begin on Friday and often still be going on Tuesday.\"\nAs much he loved teaching grade threes and fours (\"a really cute age – they're keen to learn, keen to impress and invariably just full of beans and funny…\"), it was his extra-curricular activities, hosting programs on Melbourne's public radio station Triple R (where he started in 1978) and the odd waiting gig at the now defunct comedy club The Last Laugh that really cemented his career path.\nAt Melbourne's legendary Last Laugh, even the waitstaff were encouraged to be interactive, and Nankervis thrived on the performance side of the job.\n\"I found it so liberating after teaching! Even though I was given a high degree of freedom at Wesley, where I taught, the  Last Laugh was a  wonderland of comedy and music – lots of bands would come in after their gigs and comedians… and I was doing shows at Triple R – it all felt very natural.\"\nHe was hanging out with musos and comics and soon scored a gig in the Laugh's ad-libbed on-stage soap opera, Let The Blood Run Free, which was eventually picked up by Channel Ten. From there, Nankervis quickly became a name on the circuit, especially after his turn as the earnest street poet Raymond J Bartholomeuz​ in the 1980s and '90s on Hey Hey It's Saturday . \nRemember the kid who appeared on the show doing a Raymond J impersonation? So does everybody else.\n\"It's very rare for me to do a show and someone not to ask about him! Everyone wants to know what he does now –  and I have no idea!\"\nPost-Raymond J he started doing theatre and fell in with local actors and comics.\n\"I started doing shows at Theatre Works and then ...it just kept going,\" he says. \n\"It's been this wonderful … rolling career where one thing has led to another.\"\nOver our mains and a glass of wine (\"I'll have one – I won't do a Tex Perkins on you\") Nankervis is even warmer company than you'd expect; it's more casual chat and music arguments (he emphatically will not accept that Goat's Head Soup is the Stones' most under-rated album) than regular interview.\nWe talk about his love of St Kilda, his kids, Claudia, 20, Lola, 17, and Henry Joe, 13, his new(ish) dog, and what new music we're listening to.\nAnd, of course, RocKwiz , now in its 13th season. \nAs well as co-creator and on-screen judge, you might say he's also the show's warm-up man – greeting the audiences, selecting potential contestants and putting them through a pre-show quiz before whittling down 24 audience members to the four who appear on air.\nThis year's series of themed shows has finished its run on TV (and scored the program's best ratings yet), but the live tour is about to begin – a highlight of his RocKwiz year.\n\"The tour is like the pinnacle of it all; it's like a great school camp,\" he says.\nThis year's live tour is themed around the Aria Hall of Fame, promising Oz rock legends, and will travel across the country from regional Victoria to Perth and outback Queensland.\n\"We love doing the show at the Espie but the live shows are something different – and they're special because they're not recorded, so if you're in the audience, that's it,\" he says.\nHe won't reveal who the musical guests are but there's bound to be some big names.\n\"Although the internationals are harder to get – it's hard to ask a band to come in on what might be their only day to perform with someone they might not have heard of, learn a song they don't know…\"\nNankervis isn't naming names but there have also been a few local acts reluctant to appear.\n\"I think some feel, 'All right, I'll be sitting there with Beryl from Bentleigh on my right and Craig from Cranbourne on my left – what if they answer every question?' These contestants are music nerds, let's be honest. I think there are some artists who have said no because of that.\"\nThose that do appear (clearly) love doing so, and RocKwiz has had many a repeat guest. Even though there's a loose script (less so in the live tour), there's an element of 'anything might happen'.\n\"Julia is incredibly good at improvising; she'll take the basics and she'll run with it.\n\"And because we have contestants drawn from the audience, it gives it an unpredictability. They're usually well behaved – although you don't always see the bits we cut out,\" he says.\nHe also attributes the show's appeal to music's ability to draw viewers back to a certain time and place.\n\"It establishes this link with the past which can be – not always, but tends to be – quite euphoric, nostalgic.\n\"It's got the glow of youth and discovery. And yet we are also at pains to always feature current acts. We always like to match a veteran with a newer act.\"\nNostalgia aside, Nankervis also reckons there's a simpler answer in an analogy someone recently shared with  him.\n\"They described RocKwiz as like a wonderful game of cricket on Boxing Day:  everyone gets a go, grandma gets looked after, the little kids are looked after, it's silly but it has its roots in a strong tradition,\" he says.\n\"I thought that was perfect.\"\nThe RocKwiz Live tour runs from September 30 until November 30.
