Schumer, Griffin, Goldberg and Handler all earned more through TV and film than standup over the past 12 months.\nBut Forbes also points out funny females have struggled for decades. Since 1959, only three women have won the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album: Griffin, Goldberg and Lily Tomlin.\nE! adds Jennifer Lawrence recently criticized the \"major issue\" with an op-ed for Lena Dunham's newsletter. The \"Hunger Games\" actress shared her disappointment at learning her male \"American Hustle\" co-stars Bradley Cooper and Jeremy Renner made much more than she did.\nLawrence said she got mad at herself, saying she \"failed as a negotiator\" because she was afraid of asking for more money and becoming unlikable.\nWhen asked about the pay gap this week, Renner said it's \"not my job\" to ensure co-stars get paid equally.\n2015's highest-paid comedians\n1.
