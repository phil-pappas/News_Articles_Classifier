On the same day that prominent journalist Rajdeep Sardesai wrote an open letter to Aditya Thackeray, Thackeray replied to the letter, explaining his party’s stand and justifying their actions. Sardesai had written a letter to his ‘fellow Xavierite’, saying that he wanted to ‘dare’ to advise him. post the incident where Sena members spilt black ink on Sudheendra Kulkarni. In the open letter, Sardesai had condemned the Sena brand of politics, saying that their actions reflected ‘cowardice’ not nationalism. Quick on the heels of Sardesai’s open letter, came Thackeray’s open letter, which he posted on his Facebook wall. Thackeray was extremely defensive of Sainik’s actions in his hard hitting reply, saying that what was done was and that the ink spilled was rather the blood of innocent soldiers and civilians, who have died and continue to die due to ceasefire violations. Unlike Sardesai who had said that he was angry with the Sena, the way it was angry with Kulkarni, Thackeray said,”I must confess,… I am not angry with you. Anger/ frustration occurs with when hopes are destroyed. May be that explains why I am not angry with you.” Talking about the incident, he said,” Ink spilt may be more violent for you than its intent to protest against all the innocent blood spilt on the streets of Mumbai, Jammu and Kashmir, every city that has faced Pakistan sponsored terrorism. ” Also Read: Sudheendra Kulkarni attack: Rajdeep Sardesai has some tough questions for former college mate Aditya Thackeray in this open letter Thackeray claimed that Sena has always supported peace, albiet with a hint of doubt and that it continues to do so. In his open letter, Sardesai had alluded to the Sena repeatedly using violence to protest against something, saying that ‘some things never change’. Expressing anger and disappointment over ‘acts of terror and betrayal from Pakistan’, Thackeray replied,”till the time such betrayals, by acts of terrorism in our country don’t change to acts of fulfilling promises that have been made to various Prime Ministers of India for the last few decades, is there really a need to engage with Pakistan in any other way than to make them ensure that all the terrorist camps harboured by their system are dismantled?” While one may not particularly feel completely at ease with the party’s aggressive and violent ways and extreme form of politics, Thackeray’s letter makes a relatively good case for their actions, making it imnpossible for one to ignore his arguments. Especially is the case so when he says: “The point really being, we all accept that art, culture, cricket and literature are symbols of freedom and more so are carried by people who are innocent and away from politics of the two countries. Why do we stand against it? The question can be answered by more questions- 1) Who do these terrorists target and kill? Aren’t the ones killed in all these attacks innocent lives too? The ones killed may belong to India or any other nationality, but aren’t they innocent? 2) If we support freedom, why does our Independence Day celebration for so many decades have a red alert and the Prime Minister speaking behind bullet proof glass (till it was recently denied by our current PM)? 3) Yes art and culture is the epitome of innocence and mustn’t come in the line of fire of politics. But then surely our soldiers posted at the border aren’t provoking the ceasefire violations, and I count them as innocent as the Indians killed in the terrorist attacks- not one sporadic incident but occurring time and again, and well planned.” Read the full reply here . \n  8:20 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:00:13.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
