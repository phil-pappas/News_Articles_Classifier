I had, through my life, often wondered if in any of my past lives I was a freedom fighter. If I fought for my country , if I had the fortune of laying my life down for our independence. Now, having shot for Rajkahini , I have no regrets left. I lived, what I had only wondered about.I seldom felt like an actor on the sets. Mostly , I felt like a warrior. And a very very powerful one at that!\nMy director was a strict, yet sorted one. Srijit knows exactly what he wants as far as his films are concerned. He etched out the characters in detail -their motivation well briefed and their looks, well defined. While everybody in the group would go for natural makeup, Sohini and I had tan all over our body. Our characters were raw, wild, free...The canvas was huge, the effort was enormous, the portrayal was tough but the team wasn't one to give up easy . The cast and the crew shot through thick and thin, and stuck together while at it. It took us a month-long workshop, an unbelievable bonding and above all, a 'let's make a difference' attitude! I remember, most of the days we would shoot in 10-12 degrees temperature. For the outdoors, shot somewhere near Jharkhand's border, the temperature would be as low as 3-4 degrees. Shivering, biting on our nails, left numb by the cold, we would inspire each other to give our best shot. The camera team, the sound technicians, the production members... everybody would be on their toes, always on the alert.\nAlso read: Rajkahini will remain as a milestone in my career: Priyanka Sarkar\nThe Rajkahini set used to look like a battlefield most of the time. The army's motto? Dekhna hain zor kitna bazu-e-kaatil main hain! The bonding between the women, starting from Dwitipriya to Lilydi, was something I will vouch for. Ritudi, Sudiptadi, Priyanka, Ena, Parno, Jaya, Sohini, Ridhima, myself... none of us had seen a bigger cast than this so far! And yet, we gelled so well. Laughing together was just a part of sharing meals and makeup tables with each other.\nRajkahini is so far my most adventurous and enriching experience. I feel liberated as an actor. I got to know my limitations, worked on them and learnt from my mistakes. My co-actors were so immensely talented that, needless to say , it was a huge learning experience. One has to wait for the grand release to test my words. But what I can say now is that, while for other shoots, I have sweated it out, I have bled for Rajkahini . I feel closer to being a complete actor.\nTo conclude, this was a grand journey and a memorable experience. I want more films like this to happen, for the sake of history , for the sake of Bengali film industry .
