He recently visited the country as part of a whirlwind month that included a Monday stop at the White House and an appearance Tuesday at the U.S. Capitol. \n“We are going to move to a place where my kids can study and learn, and all of them being accepted by that country,” Ahmed’s father, Mohamed Elhassan Mohamed, told The Dallas Morning News before boarding an airplane from Washington back home to Texas on Tuesday. \nThe statement said the family has been “overwhelmed by the many offers of support” since Ahmed’s arrest on Sept. 14 at his school in Irving, a Dallas suburb. The family said it accepted an offer from the Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development to join its Young Innovators Program. \nAhmed, who along with his family will relocate to Qatar, received a full scholarship for his secondary and undergraduate education. Ahmed said he was impressed with the program and thinks he’ll “learn a lot and have fun, too.” \nAhmed took a homemade clock to his high school to show a teacher, but another teacher thought it could be a bomb. The school contacted police, who handcuffed the boy and took him to a detention center. The school suspended him for three days. NOTE: Ahmed brought his disassembled clock to school during the September 11 commemoration week. Once the casing on any clock is removed, the wires attached to the face of the clock which continues ticking gives it the look and sound of a live bomb. \nAhmed’s older sister, seen beaming with pride when he speaks to the press, did the same thing 3 years previous to when Ahmed took his clock to school. She too was suspended for pulling the same stunt. \nWhen one examines the photographs of the people standing with Ahmed it is clear that while his father is present, Ahmed was surrounded by three or four additional men. They are Imams from the Irving, Texas SHARIA LAW CENTER and their photographs appear on the center’s website where they are identified as Imams (Islamic religious leaders). \nA police photo of the device shows a carrying case containing a circuit board and power supply wired to a digital display. Police ultimately chose not to charge Ahmed with having a hoax bomb, and the police chief has said there was no evidence the teen meant to cause alarm. His parents later withdrew him from the school. \nBut in recent weeks, the teenager has been traveling the world. Ahmed earlier this week told The Associated Press that he had visited Google and Facebook, along with other companies and institutions. He also visited with the president of Sudan, Omar al-Bashir, which has prompted some criticism because al-Bashir is wanted by International Criminal Court on charges of genocide and war crimes for atrocities linked to the Darfur fighting. Ahmed’s father is a Sudanese immigrant to the U.S. and a former presidential candidate in Sudan who ran opposing al-Bashir. \nBefore attending “Astronomy Night” at the White House on Monday, where he chatted briefly with President Barack Obama, Ahmed said he was grateful. He said the lesson of his experience is: “Don’t judge a person by the way they look. Always judge them by their heart.” \nOn Tuesday at the U.S. Capitol, Ahmed stood alongside California Rep. Mike Honda as the Democrat praised the teen, saying Ahmed had used his negative experience to raise awareness about racial and ethnic profiling. Honda and more than two dozen other congressmen sent a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch last month calling on the Department of Justice to investigate Ahmed’s detention and arrest. \nAhmed’s leaving the USA \nAhmed’s invention was no invention at all. He disassembled a clock as his sister had done 3 years earlier. Both Ahmed and his sister took the pile of wires attached to the ticking clocks to school during the week when the United States was commemorating September 11. \nFirst the older sister brought a dismantled clock to school, then Ahmed did the same 3 years later. Each was suspended at the time of their respective “show and tell” incidents. \nDid the mess of wires look like a bomb? Yes it did and the ticking of the clock made it look like a “ticking time bomb.” And each of these siblings said that they did it to rattle the cages of their respective High School teachers. It worked in both cases – each was suspended. \nMany people that choose not to read details, immediately got behind Ahmed as though he was some kind of inventor the country had offended. The opposite was true. \nAhmed was not an inventor of any kind. He just likes to dismantle clocks and other appliances. He has never fixed an appliance and he never invented one. He only knew how to take things apart including his schoolmate’s and teachers’ peace of mind. \nIn one of his interviews he gave himself away while referring to his teacher, saying “I knew she would be scared but I did it anyway.” \nMany well educated but foolish people got behind Ahmed, including Barack Obama. They didn’t bother to examine who else was being photographed when Ahmed gave his rather adult press conference. \nIt was not just a grieving teenager’s family. He was surrounded by Irving, Texas’ SHARIA LAW CENTER Imams. The organization is controversial is already controversial. Ahmed was photographed surrounded by Imams. Unusual for a teen to be surrounded by such an illustrious group of religious leaders. \nIncidents like these are why the world laughs at the United States. \n11 Current Visitors On This Page CRYPTO CURRENCIES ARE NOW LEGAL COMMODITIES Commodities are powered by Investing.com RECENT ARTICLES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T09:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:10:39.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
