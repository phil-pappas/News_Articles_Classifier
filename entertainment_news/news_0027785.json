Since the fifth season's cliffhanger , Jon Snow's ( Kit Harington ) fate has become the frequently asked question and the topic was brought into the discussion at the event. When they were asked which character they'd like to interact with, the three said, \"Jon Snow!\" before Jones retorted, \"He's dead, we couldn't possibly work with him anymore!\" Still, he couldn't help imagining what would happen if his character met Jon Snow. \"Loras could probably try and turn Jon Snow gay,\" he quipped. \"I'd like to see that happen, and also share hair tips as well, that'd be fabulous. I'd teach him a thing or two.\" Talking about what would happen to their characters in season 6, they were all coy. \"We're in dangerous territory for the next season if I talk to you about that,\" Dormer said when asked how Margaery would handle it if she had to do the walk of shame Cersei ( Lena Headey ) went through in season 5. Dormer hinted that Margaery would remain a threat to Cersei. \"Margaery is trying to be Cersei; she wants to be the mother of the king,\" she said. \"She's as talented at the machinations and backstabbing and politics as Cersei... It's like the Cold War [between them], mutually assured destruction.\" She went on sharing, \"I genuinely don't think Margaery wants to be on the Iron Throne; it's a dangerous place to be. She wants to be the power behind it ... it's safer to be the power behind the Throne than be on the Throne.\" As for Loras who's in jail, Jones teased, \"He's in the hands of some very nasty people. And they don't agree with him, so you should be worried.\" Jones also shared his vision of how the show would end. \"Basically I think there will be a big battle between Ice and Fire,\" he said. \"My theory is they're going to have to dissolve the Iron Throne to defeat the White Walkers ... and then I think out of the ashes will come the tree people, they'll grow [out the new world]. Bran, Hodor, Tyrion [will survive] to bring peace back to the realm. But knowing 'Game of Thrones', it'll be Littlefinger on the throne and there will be no help.\" \"Game of Thrones\" season 6 is expected to premiere in spring 2016. Pilou Asbaek, Max von Sydow , Ian McShane and Richard E. Grant are added to the cast. Deadline has also confirmed recent report that Melanie Liburd will portray a new Red Priestess. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com More Game of Thrones News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:59:17.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
