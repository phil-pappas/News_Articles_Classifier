The K-Rock Zombie Ball took over the Landmark Theatre in Syracuse, N.Y., Saturday, Oct. 24, 2015. Scott Schild | sschild@syracuse.com \nSYRACUSE, N.Y. -- Suck it, vampires. Zombies are still the hottest Halloween trend around. \nDowntown Syracuse was alive with the undead this weekend, as animated corpses invaded the Landmark Theatre for K-ROCK's third annual Zombie Ball . In Armory Square, 95X also hosted its own Zombie Crawl from bar to bar. \n\"This event is always a hit, but I'm 'zombied' out, to be honest,\" said Zombie Ball organizer Chris Barrella. \"I don't watch 'The Walking Dead,' I never really got into it.\" \nSyracuse, however, is not zombied out. About 400 people attended the Zombie Ball, to enjoy haunted tours of the theater, quaff Halloween-themed cocktails and request psychic readings, makeovers or tattoos by BioGraphix Tattoo Studio . \nRelated: 25 Halloween parties in Central New York \nA handful of Zombie Ball guests dressed in non-zombie costumes, but most took the undead theme and ran with it. \nNoah Ellis, dressed as a zombie Mad Hatter, said the constant use of zombies in the media are to blame for their relentless popularity year after year. \n\"It's 'The Walking Dead' and all the movies like that,\" said Ellis, of Oswego. \"They're everywhere.\" \nEveryone I approached could name their favorite zombie movie on the spot. Some aggressively provoked a debate, hoping to argue why their favorite was the best. \nTravis Tysco and Sabrina Perry love \"Shaun of the Dead.\" Jeff and Heather White prefer the original \"Dawn of the Dead.\" Lauren Stahl and Faith Schreiber are obsessed with \"Warm Bodies.\" Amber Nadeau and Charlie St. Denis praised \"28 Days Later\" for making zombies fast, and much scarier as a result. \nDressed as a zombie cheerleader and football jock, St. Denis and Nadeau said human beings will never stop loving the zombie genre. \n\"Death is a part of life and we're obsessed with it,\" said St. Denis, of Baldwinsville. \"Look at the story of Jesus. Look at our legends of the dead rising. In Mexico, they respect their dead and celebrate them.\" \nPlus, they said, monster movies featuring ghosts, witches and vampires have been done to death, literally. \n\"Look how many bad sequels came out of 'Paranormal Activity,'\" St. Denis said. \"And now they're making all the little horror movie kids look like the girl from 'The Ring.' They've run out of new ideas, but people keep making different, creative zombie films.\" \nHe's not wrong. Zombie sequels, remakes and even parodies continue to be critical and commercial box office smashes. These days, you can't get through a commercial break without seeing an ad for \"Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse.\" Bloggers freak out every time a new trailer leaks for \" Pride and Prejudice and Zombies ,\" out in 2016. \n\"The Walking Dead\" began airing in 2010 and shows no signs of slowing down. AMC even debuted a new spin-off series \"Fear the Walking Dead\" last August. \nDespite our passion for zombies, many agreed most citizens of Syracuse would not survive an actual zombie apocalypse. Lindsay Rutte and Ken Binder would try to escape rather than fighting. \n\"I feel like we'd be screwed,\" said Binder, a Syracuse student. (Luckily, Syracuse has its own Zombie Research Society .) \nSt. Denis and Nadeau would try to get some ammo, then camp out by a body of water. \n\"We'd be f***ed,\" said Nadeau, laughing. \"I would try to get to the most remote location as possible, but Syracuse is a city. If there's anything the movies teach us, it's that you never survive in a city.\" \nKatrina Tulloch writes features and entertainment stories for Syracuse.com and The Post-Standard.
