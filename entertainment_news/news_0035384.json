After that, the Moon moves from Gemini into Cancer. Aries (March 21-April 19) \nIt’s important to remember that this month, the Sun is 180 degrees opposite your sign, which means it is as far away from you as it gets all year. The Sun is your source of energy; this means you will need more sleep. Go to bed. Taurus (April 20-May 20) \nThis month you want to get better organized. Naturally, Mercury retrograde makes this almost impossible, but it is “the plan.” The placement of the Sun also encourages you to do something to improve your health. Get with “the plan.” Gemini (May 21-June 20) \nThis is a lovely, playful time! You want to schmooze, enjoy sports, have a vacation, dabble in romance (or more than dabble) and have playful times with children. Take time to play because life is more than work, work, work. Cancer (June 21-July 22) \nIt’s appropriate to focus your attention on home and family needs. This is the ideal time to carry out plans for fix-it projects and do-it-yourself repairs and renovations. Relatives you haven’t heard from for ages might be sleeping on your sofa. Leo (July 23-Aug. 22) \nThis Mercury retrograde will create both transportation delays as well as silly errors, lost items, confused communications and missed appointments. It’s all quite maddening, but they are mostly goofy things. It’s embarrassing, isn’t it? Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22) \nAt this time, you’re thinking about your basic values. In other words, you want to know what really matters. You don’t want to be 90 years old looking in the mirror and saying to yourself, “You blew it.” That’s why you’re thinking of money, possessions and how to handle your assets. Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22) \nWith the Sun in your sign, it’s easy to attract favorable situations to you as well as interesting, important people. In other words, you are at the center of it all! Furthermore, the Sun is boosting your energy and giving you a chance to recharge your batteries for the rest of the year. Scorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21) \nUse the next few weeks to ponder what you want your new year (birthday to birthday) to be all about. Studies definitely indicate that setting goals, especially with timelines, improves the likelihood of success in achieving those goals. Ideas? Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21) \nEnjoy this popular time. Friends can be very helpful to you now and perhaps even friends from the past that are popping up right now. After all, you’re setting off on a whole new path at this stage in your life, which means you need all the help you can get. Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19) \nThis is a curious time because you are entering- a two to three-year window where you will dismantle much of what you created since 2003. This month, people admire you, especially people in authority. Turn this to your advantage and make the most of it. Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18) \nTravel anywhere if possible because you want to get outta Dodge. You’re hungry for a change of scenery or a chance to learn something new. If you can sign up for a course or some type of training, this will also please you because it will be something new that expands your world. Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20) \nYou will definitely improve your closest friendships and partnerships this year. Right now, this month, you’re on a self-improvement kick. You want to become a better person. You also want to get loose details regarding shared property, inheritances and your debt in better shape. If Your Birthday Is Today \nActress-dancer Alicia Vikander (1988) shares your birthday today. You are socially aware of the impression you create and of the trends in society. (You’re hip.) You are always professional. This is the year you have been waiting for. It’s a time of expansion and great activity. Take advantage of opportunities. A major change might take place, perhaps as significant as what occurred around 2006. It’s time to try your wings!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T14:38:13.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
