The two are captured during takes of \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\" at Schilthorn near Muerren, Switzerland. Though the Australian actor never played Bond again following disagreements with producers, his one outing is considered one of the best. The film's ending is perhaps the most memorable in the entire Bond series. The upcoming new Bond film \"Spectre\" starring Daniel Craig has its World Premiere on Monday Oct. 26, 2015, in London.
