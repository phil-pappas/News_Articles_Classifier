Family ‘Squabbles’ take Tulare Encore spotlight \nAnd it strikes again starting at 7:30 p.m. Friday, Oct. 16 at the COS Theatre in the production adapted for the stage by Chris Mangels, the longtime COS theater instructor and director. \nFrom left, Raenni Pilgrim, (not pictured), Nika Valk, Rebekah Robles and Christopher Dorado are acting in \"Dracula\" at College of the Sequoias Theatre Department on Monday, October 5, 2015. (Photo: Johanna Coyne) \nFor lead actress Rebekah Robles, appearing as Wilhelmina “Mina” Harker, the nightmare doesn’t lie in what jumps out of the shadows but what stands to lurk in the darkness. \n“It’s kind of letting that slow burn happen,” Robles said. “You can’t just be like, ‘Boo!’ You know you have to let that build up. It’s like you are that suspenseful music to accompany the monster in the closet.” \n“It’s trying to make everything feel like it’s really happening to this person,” said Christopher Dorado in the role of solicitor Johnathan Harker. “We’ve got a lot of great sound effects and Foley art going into this that are really going to set you in the world.” COS Art Gallery gets hallucinatory \nAudiences are well used to seeing the nefarious Count Dracula on the big screen, with the character having been depicted in more than 217 films with countless other similar characters modeled after his blood-thirsty demeanor. \nIn actuality, it was on the stage that the tale of “Dracula” found new life when the curtain opened on the stage adaptation of “Nosferatu” in 1922. \nBefore that moment the original book remained critically successful and yet commercially unprofitable, leaving Stoker himself to die in poverty. \nRebekah Robles, right, and Christopher Dorado are acting in \"Dracula\" at College of the Sequoias Theatre Department on Monday, October 5, 2015. (Photo: Johanna Coyne) \nIt’s in noting the horrific details that Bram Stoker emphasized in the original novel that Mangels sought to emphasize. \nHis cast reflects that mission in staying as authentic as possible to the original source material. \n“There're a lot of different versions of Dracula that have been done over the years and some amazing actors have portrayed Van Helsing,” actor David Lemon said. “But really for me the biggest thing was actually picking up Bram Stoker’s novel, reading it and trying to understand what was going through his mind when he was creating the character.” ‘Sicario’ a grim view of bloody war on drugs \nThe actors even went through what they describe at “Vamp Camp,” which involved a marathon of all things vampire, much to the dismay of actress Robles who doesn’t have an easy stomach when it comes to spilled blood. \n“I read some of the book,” she said. “I don’t do scary, I’m afraid of scary. It was difficult when the only time you have to read is at night, so I was like, I can’t do this, but it’s true to it.” \nThis particular stage adaptation by Mangels originally hit the COS stage in 2008 to a sold-out theater. \n“It was very very theatrical,” Dorado recalled. “It had a lot of really great special effects and projections on the screen. I got to see it back when I was in high school and I was blown away by it. This time around it’s a completely different show.” \nCollege of the Sequoias Theatre Department presents \"Dracula\" on Monday, October 5, 2015. (Photo: Johanna Coyne) \nOne directorial shift is in having Count Dracula appear not in the flesh, but through the use of a highly detailed hand-crafted effigy operated by two puppeteers. \nWith Raenni Pilgrim and Nika Valk operating the right and left hands of Count Dracula simultaneously from within his shadow, the two are forced to share a single mind in making the infamous character come to life. \n“I’m used to building a character myself, but now it’s a shared experience and it’s been wonderful,” Valk said. “It’s been an awesome voyage learning the basics of puppeteering and having the puppet as an extension of yourself.” ‘Sicario’ a grim view of bloody war on drugs \nIn addition to handling the puppet with Pilgrim, Valk also lends her voice to the blood-thirsty villain, although, she too prefers to leave that monster simmering in the shadows before its suddenly unleashed. \n“I do the voice, but you would have to come to the show in order to hear it,” she said with a grin. \nWhatever that ghostly echo from the past may sound like in person, it certainly promises to elicit blood-curdling screams from the audience. \nHow to attend \n“Dracula” premieres 7:30 p.m. Friday, Oct. 16 at the COS Theatre.
