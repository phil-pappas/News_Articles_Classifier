The decision was written by Circuit Judge Debra Ann Livingston. \nBaldwin, 81, and two granddaughters sued EMI Feist Catalog Inc. in Manhattan federal court in 2012, claiming entitlement to re-establish their share of publishing copyright ownership in December 2016. \nA three-judge appeals panel agreed, rejecting EMI Feist's claims it could hold the copyright until 2029. EMI Feist is an arm of the London-based music company EMI Group. A lower-court judge in December 2013 had ruled for the company. Its lawyers did not immediately return messages seeking comment. \nBaldwin — one of the composer's four children — said she initiated the legal case for the benefit of younger relatives. \nShe said the family had always received a songwriter's royalty cut but no longer got payouts from publishing rights. She said she did not know how much those rights were worth. \n\"We'll find out, won't we?\" Baldwin said. \nAccording to court papers, Coots' heirs had been offered $2.75 million by EMI about eight years ago to drop claims. \nLawyers opposing the lawsuit had argued that Coots gave up some rights when he in 1981 accepted $100,000, which he distributed to his children. \nThe current heirs were described in the lawsuit as Baldwin, three granddaughters and three grandsons. \nBaldwin recalled him as a \"tough\" father who \"liked to go to the track\" but was mostly careful with money. \n\"We never went hungry. We always had nice clothes. We went to public schools,\" she said. \nBaldwin said her father wrote the music while Gillespie wrote lyrics on the back of an envelope after a publisher told the pair: \"Write me something for Christmas, a novelty.\" \n\"It was just for Christmastime. You didn't hear it in June or July,\" she said. The tune gained fame after Eddie Cantor sang it on his radio program in 1934. \nNow, decisions about the song's use are made by granddaughters of Coots living in Connecticut and California. \nBaldwin said she had no plans for new income. \n\"At my age, trying to get up in the morning is my goal of the day,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:23:29.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
