The tour opened in Columbia earlier this month, and Williams had a purpose in starting the tour in South Carolina. \nMuch of the impetus was the massacre of nine African-American church members in Charleston last June, which added another dimension to the national dialogue about race, he said. \n\"Once you travel this country, you realize that the things that happen in the inner cities, a lot of those situations are different situations than the things that are taking place in the smaller towns around the U.S.,” he said. “And a lot of the things that people don't know yet, they're already in existence in these pockets in our country that we don't put enough focus on until it's a major news issue.... We understand that this isn't a South conversation, or a Carolina conversation, but it's an actual national conversation.\" \nWilliams, who’s 42, has enjoyed a successful career in standup comedy and in films over the past decade or so. He’s appeared in films like “Norbit” and “Scary Movie 5,” and next year he will co-star with Ed Helms and Owen Wilson in the film “Bastards.” \nFor Williams, 42, comedy can be found in every nook and cranny of life, even in the midst of unimaginable tragedy. \n\"That's what God created humor to be. Life can be difficult and dangerous and stressful and all of those things, but comedy is the great mediator. No matter how serious the conversations are, there is humor in the discussion. … It's really comedy that allows the discourse to go further than, 'I'm angry, and you're angry’ or ‘I’m sad, and you’re sad.’” \nAnd Williams doesn’t think that any particular subject should be automatically considered off-limits. Humor, he said, is a way to broach challenging topics in a way that provokes thought and dialogue. \nAs he sees it, a comic is like a painter, figuring out where the lines should be. \n\"I think the job of the painter is to not go too far, and a part of the process of not going too far is knowing where the lines are. And so the only way that you could know where the lines are, it has to be constantly tested. The painter is always trying to paint something that he hasn't painted before, or figure out a new way to express something that's already been expressed before him.” \nWilliams' stage persona is loud, manic, outrageous. Over the phone, however, he's soft-spoken, speaking in thoughtful, measured sentences. \nAs with any comic, his stage persona is an amped-up exaggeration of his offstage persona. \n“I'm only given an hour to discuss one million topics with my best friends in the world, and they all gather in one place so we can catch up from we were last time in our conversation, to where we are now so that when we walk out, we feel fulfilled in our relationship,” he said. “It's not something I can do in a calm, lackadaisical fashion... In my personal life, I'm much calmer because I'm a cool, sexy guy.” \nYOU CAN GO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T21:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:35:35.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
