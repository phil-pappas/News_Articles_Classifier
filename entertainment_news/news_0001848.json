But as I look back, I feel that feeling.” \nDuring Thicke’s testimony, which was taken in April, 2014, the pop star admitted he was drunk and high on painkiller Vicodin during a 2013 interview with Oprah Winfrey to promote the single, and he added, “With all due respect, I was high and drunk every time I did an interview last year.” \nThe lawsuit was brought by Gaye’s children Nona, Frankie and Marvin Gaye III, who inherited the copyright to their father’s music after his death in 1984.
