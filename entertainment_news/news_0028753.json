The musical bonanza features both eminent artistes as well as those who shot up to recognition at relatively younger ages. In its 62nd year, the festival has two new additions-folk and light music.\n\"No artiste of national and international eminence has ever missed out from being featured in the prestigious event, a much sought after by both artistes and connoisseurs,\" say mandarins in the music division of Akashvani Bhawan.\nThis year's garland of Akashvani Sangeet Sammelan will be held at 24 venues, and will feature many eminent and promising artistes from across the country from the streams of Hindustani, Carnatic, Light and Folk Music.\nThe evening concerts for Hindustani and Carnatic music will be held at 15 venues i.e. Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Indore, Lucknow, Ahmedabad, Jalandhar, Goa, Nagpur, Thiruvanathapuram, Mangaluru and Thrissur.\nThe morning concerts only for Hindustani music will be held at three venues i.e. Agartala, Raipur and Jammu.\nThe evening concerts for Folk and Light music will be held at six places i.e. Dehradun, Ranchi, Rohtak, Jodhpur, Coimbatore and Vijayawada.\nIn all, 63 artistes will take part in the event, including 26 Hindustani Music artistes, 14 Carnatic Music artistes and 23 Light and Folk Music artistes. There will be over 150 accompanists as well.\nThese concerts will be aired on the National hook-up between November 7 and December 13.\nLast year Akashvani Sangeet Sammelan had paid tribute to Sardari Begum as part of centenary celebration of Sardari. This year's uniqueness lies in the idea of factoring in virginity of folk and light music too.\nThis year too each 24 concert will be recorded for archival purpose.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:41:13.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
