Legend would have it that The Grim Reaper rouses himself at midnight, summons the skeletons from the grave, and they all boogie down until the rooster crows at dawn. \nAlthough there will be plenty to keep the youngsters entertained it’s not all innocent trick or treating. Halloween warrants something more diabolical, evoking noisome crypts and jangling bones. The Danse Macabre is a spine-tingling reminder that no matter what our station is in life, death unites us all. \nPatrons will be terrifyingly entertained by skeletal stilt walkers from the moment they arrive and mesmerised by the projection mapping of Danse Macabre on the historical Pumphouse building. They can join in the ghostly jaunt on the lawns of the Victorian Village before venturing into the sinister cemetery along with its resident spectres - if they dare! \nFor those brave and old enough, MOTAT invites them to experience the spooky ‘Dead Poets Corner’, the bizarre ‘Bazarre’ festooned with dirty beggars, a vulgar butcher and wretched ladies of the night as well as ‘Jack the Ripper’s House’ and the ghoulish medical school where no-one gets out alive. They could even meet Sweeney Todd, Jack or The Reaper himself. \nAdd to this the showmanship and First Scene’s costume parades, tasty treats, children's creepy courtyard and an edgy atmosphere of eerie fun and it bound to equal an Olde Hallows Eve no one will ever forget. \nOf course, everyone gets a birthday and then dances through life as best they can - but then everyone gets a death day too. Celebrate Halloween at MOTAT’s Danse Macabre this year. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T23:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:38:53.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
