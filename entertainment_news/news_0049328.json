NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg met with Turkish Foreign Minister Feridun Sinirlioglu and convened a meeting to discuss the situation.\n\"I urge Russia to take the necessary steps to align its efforts with those of the international community in the fight against ISIL,\" Stoltenberg said in a statement, using an acronym for Islamic State, the al-Qaida breakaway faction that controls vast stretches of Syria and neighboring Iraq.\nSyria, an ally of Russia, is engaged in a more than four-year war against armed insurgents backed by the United States, Turkey and other Western allies. The skies over the country are becoming increasingly crowded with combat aircraft, including Russian and U.S. fighter jets, raising concerns about a possible unintended confrontation.\nTurkey, like the United States, has criticized the Russian intervention in the Syrian conflict.\nRussia says its planes are targeting \"terrorists,\" but Washington and Ankara say the targets appear to include \"moderate\" rebel formations, some backed by Washington and Ankara. The precise definition of \"moderate\" in the Syrian context is unclear, however. Western-backed factions in Syria acknowledge coordination on the ground with radical Islamist militias such as the Nusra Front, the official al-Qaida affiliate in Syria.\n\"So far, no one really has managed to explain what the moderate opposition is,\" Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman, told Russian state television on Saturday.\nOn Monday, Turkish authorities said they had summoned the Russian envoy to Ankara and protested \"strongly\" about the weekend incursion, reported the Andalou state news agency.\nMoscow was informed that it would be held responsible for any \"undesired incident\" arising from any future violation, the state media said.\nTurkish media later reported that Russia said the breach was the result of a \"navigation error.\" The Russian jet penetrated Turkish airspace for several hundred yards, with the breach lasting about two minutes, according to Hurriyet Daily News, a Turkish daily.\nIn Moscow, the Kremlin said it would look into the incident, Russian news agencies reported.\nTurkey's more than 500-mile-long border with Syria has been a major conduit for opposition forces and supplies entering Syria. Battles have periodically raged at flash-point towns on the Syrian side of the border, with shells often landing in Turkish territory, prompting retaliatory fire from Turkish batteries. Ankara and Damascus have previously exchanged allegations of airspace violations.\nThe start of the Russian air offensive has added to the array of combat traffic in Syrian skies.\nThe United States and allied nations have spent more than a year bombarding militant positions in Syria, mostly those of Islamic State.\nU.S. and Russian officials said last week that they had discussed ways to improve communications and avoid an aerial face-off.\nLast week, Moscow said it had given U.S. officials due warning of its plan to start bombing militant targets in Syria, and advised the Pentagon to keep its aircraft away. But U.S. officials said they only had an hour's notice. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter labeled the Russian behavior \"unprofessional.\"\nMeanwhile, Russia said Monday that its warplanes had conducted 25 additional sorties in Syria during the previous 24 hours, destroying a militant base and communications hub in northwest Idlib province, a \"command center\" in neighboring Latakia province and arms depots in Homs province.\nTo date, the Russian aerial onslaught has been focused on strategic rebel strongholds in central and northwest Syria. The targeted areas flank heavily populated government bastions in Damascus, the capital, and along the Mediterranean coast.\n(McDonnell reported from Beirut and Hennigan from Madrid.)\n(c)2015 Tribune Co.\nVisit Tribune Co. at www.latimes.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1732973", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1732973&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1732973&h=Russian+warplane+violates+Turkish+airspace%2C+drawing+criticism+in+West"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:28:05.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
