He was not happy, cursing at hosts Caroline Flack and Olly Murs: “Oh, f***! Are you winding me up?” X Factor judges Nick Grimshaw, Rita Ora, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and Simon Cowell (ITV Pictures) \nSimon’s beloved mother Julie Brett, 89, died in July, just before auditions were due to begin. \nThe 56-year-old told Susanna Reid on ITV’s Good Morning Britain: “Funny enough, when I was watching the show, I actually was thinking: If my mum watched this now, me swearing on TV, I actually think she would have given me a whack. Very disappointed. \n“And that did make me kind of chuckle. And that’s when you realise, they’re still there with you.” Simon Cowell’s late mother Julie (Lewis Whyld/PA) \nSimon later apologised for his foul language on the show, which was bleeped out.

I deal with it because I always believe she is still here, same with my dad, you know, talk to them. \n“I always feel their presence and I genuinely do believe in that, once you get over that initial shock, then you deal with it in a different way.” \nFans were moved to see Simon open up to Susanna on such a raw topic:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T12:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:02:52.351+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
