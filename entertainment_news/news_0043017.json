This resolution is one of the latest calls for divestment from fossil fuels because they are a cause of climate change.\nThe student Executive Committee resolution, which was announced Friday, was passed during the committee's business meeting on Sept. 26.\n\"We're saying on behalf of about 465,000 students, this is what we want SUNY to do,\" said James Corra, director of communications for the Student Assembly.\nCorra said that the resolution passed 14 to 2 and will be presented to the full Student Assembly when it meets in Rochester for its fall conference in mid-November.\nUrging SUNY and its various colleges to instead invest in alternative energy and technologies, the resolution says SUNY should freeze new investments in fossil fuel companies and divest completely from any direct ownership in these companies or in funds that include fossil fuel equities and corporate bonds.\n\"This mandate comes in response to a number of factors, including the $950 billion that has been divested from fossil fuels worldwide,\" says the statement announcing the student Executive Committee's decision.\nThe statement Quote: s SUNY Student Assembly President Thomas Mastro as saying that from \"Platttsburg to Geneseo, our students have asked their home campuses and SUNY itself to divest.\"\nMastro goes on to say that by \"removing fossil fuels and potentially harmful technologies from its list of investments and instead involving itself with alternative technologies and clean energy, SUNY will take the lead on this important initiative.\"\nA spokeswoman for the SUNY administration could not be reached for comment on Saturday.\nThe 350.org environmental organization's Go Fossil Free website lists students from Monroe Community College and State University College at Geneseo as being among those having resolutions calling upon their schools to freeze any new investment in fossil fuel companies and to divest from existing investments.\nJGOODMAN@Gannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T20:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T20:06:15.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
