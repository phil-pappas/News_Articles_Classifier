As their relationship grew strained, Khloé says she found tabloid speculation \"humiliating\" and was left suffering \"social anxiety\" every time she left her house. \"You can't control other people, and you can't control the outcome of situations,\" Khloé writes, which Page Six contextualizes as a passage referring to Lamar's addiction issues specifically, \"and if you think you can, you will soon discover that you are sadly mistaken.\" On a more positive note, Khloé does credit her time with Lamar as some of the best years of her life.\nMore From Cosmopolitan In related news, Khloé and Lamar filed a petition yesterday asking for their divorce to be called off (which was granted). Lamar is said to have promised Khloé there'll be no more drugs in his future; TMZ adds that he's \"repeatedly\" told her he loves her. Lamar remains hospitalized in Los Angeles, and Us Weekly says that, while recovering, he still \"isn't doing that well.\" People reports he remains on dialysis and is receiving antibiotics for a respiratory infection; he is also unable to stand up on his own. Khloé did not attend her sister Kim's birthday party Wednesday, preferring to stay with Lamar. \"She is still very worried about him, Us 's source says, and uncomfortable with leaving [him].\"\nFollow Alex on Twitter . ​", "external_links": ["http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/640x934/gallery-1445525181-1445519748-khloe-kardashian-467.jpg", "http://twitter.com/maybealexislost", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/640x320/landscape-1445525181-1445519748-khloe-kardashian-467.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/980x1430/gallery-1445525181-1445519748-khloe-kardashian-467.jpg", "http://pagesix.com/2015/10/21/khloes-upcoming-book-tells-all-about-lamar/", "http://www.tmz.com/2015/10/22/khloe-kardashian-lamar-odom-drugs/", "http://www.people.com/article/lamar-odom-still-faces-obstacles-road-to-recovery", "http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/khloe-kardashian-skips-kims-birthday-party-stays-with-lamar-odom-20152110", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/1445525181-1445519748-khloe-kardashian-467.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/768x1121/gallery-1445525181-1445519748-khloe-kardashian-467.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/480x700/gallery-1445525181-1445519748-khloe-kardashian-467.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T19:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:24:33.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
