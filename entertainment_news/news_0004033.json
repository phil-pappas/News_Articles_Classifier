We want to hear it. “ \nControls are all wonderfully intuitive, and it helps keep the action moving at a brisk rate. \nI'm also impressed with how well inXile handled the transition to gamepad-based play. It particularly performs well when applying character skills such as lockpicking and safecracking to environmental objects. All you need to do is walk up to a safe or locked strongbox, pull the left trigger, and select the appropriate action from a skill wheel. The character with the proper ability will then announce that they'll take a shot at it or somesuch, and boom, hopefully you’ve got some new goods. The right trigger handles combat abilities in a similar fashion, allowing you to reload or activate a skill like rapid fire with minimal effort. It's all wonderfully intuitive, and it helps keep the action moving at a brisk rate. Navigating party inventory is similarly simple, as it merely requires cycling through the various rangers in your party with the left and right bumpers and transferring items with a click of the X button. The one drawback of all this is that sometimes the AI pathfinding falls short. It's generally not that much of a problem, but early on there's a segment with explosions that forced me to rely heavily on the \"wait\" command for most of my party members while my lead ranger scouted things out. New Look, Same Feel \nI'm much less in love with the \"complete visual overhaul\" the Director's Cut brings. Comparing the two versions side by side, it's easy to see that inXile remade each level down to the smallest detail, introducing new textures and populating formerly sparse maps with additional environmental objects. The catch is that most of the time the Director's Cut merely looks different and not necessarily better. I'm thinking, for instance, of a decrepit trailer found early in the game, where a merchant named Wormy Jim cautiously hawks his wares. The rocks and trees surrounding his home look more real now, as a result of the shift the the Unity 5.0 engine. The ground around him is parched and sandy in this release, with asocial clumps out grass scattered about rather than the green blanket found in the original. It's a step up, no doubt, but I admit I wouldn't have noticed anything was different had I not taken the time to compare the two. That extends to the character models, which may outshine their 2014 predecessors in detail by still look simple and muddy up close. For all the work that's been done, Wasteland 2 still looks like a game that's from several years ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T02:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:22:06.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
