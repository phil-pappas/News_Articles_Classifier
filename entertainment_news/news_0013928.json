But Lester, the owner of World Series rings with the Red Sox in 2007 and 2013, has spoken often about the continued pursuit of championships and not being content with just reaching the playoffs.\nCubs executives Ryan Dempster and Kevin Youkilis concur and give some of the credit to Lester for their own World Series rings.\n\"They didn't make a mistake when we signed him to be our leader of our staff,\" said Dempster, a 2013 teammate of Lester who recruited him to the Cubs after becoming a special assistant to general manager Jed Hoyer.\n\"He has pushed Jake Arrieta to be better. He has pushed other guys in the rotation to be better. I just watched him (with the Red Sox) and saw how much he wanted it, how hard he worked for it. It's so much fun to see a guy work that hard and see everything he gets.\n\"For him to be back in the playoffs is so awesome.\"\nThe Cubs signed Lester with the long-range goal of having him lead the pitching staff to the World Series. Despite his sub-.500 record, Lester has that opportunity now, although he will have to share the stage with Arrieta, who won 22 games during the regular season and extended his scoreless streak to 31 innings after blanking the Pirates 4-0 in Wednesday night's wild-card game.\n\"There's no stage that's big enough unless they start making a league on the moon that has a bigger stage,\" Dempster said. \"(Lester) has been on the biggest stage of all.\n\"He has won big games. He has done it as a young kid and as a younger player. He just simplifies and compartmentalizes the situation and does what he needs to do, and that's (to) focus on the task at hand. It's really awesome to see what he can do.\"\nLester is 6-4 with a 2.57 ERA in 14 postseason starts. Some observers remember how he failed to hold a 7-3 lead in the eighth inning of the 2014 American League wild-card game at Kansas City while pitching for the Athletics.\nBut Lester is returning to Busch Stadium, where he earned the second of two World Series victories over the Cardinals in 2013.\n\"Jon is a competitor who always is going to be focused, and he'll get mad when he's not doing well,\" said Youkilis, a scouting and player development consultant. \"When he's doing right, he is that prototypical guy I'm talking about.\n\"And that's why he has had so much success in the postseason. He prepares every day as if it's the postseason. If you have that attitude (and) that approach, whether you're a hitter or pitcher or running the bases, that's how you succeed in the postseason.\"\nAnd playing 8 1/2 seasons before capacity crowds at Fenway Park prepared Lester for the spotlight after joining an energized franchise in one of baseball's largest markets.\n\"The implications — win or go home — is definitely on a grander scale and in the media,\" Youkilis said. \"But when you play in a market like Chicago and Boston, it's an everyday thing. So you're used to it and you just take it into the postseason.\"\nmgonzales@tribpub.com\nTwitter @MDGonzales\nPrivacy Policy Copyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Major League Baseball Jon Lester Chicago Cubs World Series Boston Red Sox Kevin Youkilis Ryan Dempster", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5617347a/turbine/ct-jon-lester-cubs-spt-1009-20151008"], "published": "2015-10-09T06:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:30:18.221+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
