In his acceptance speech, the 54-year-old comedian poked fun at the former Mark Twain award winner, Bill Cosby , who has been accused by many women of sexual misconduct. In reference to Bill, Eddie joked that the award recipient messed up \"when they want you to give your trophy back.\" He then asked the audience, \"Bill has one of these. Did you all make him give it back?\" before performing an impersonation of Cosby who refused to give back his award following the accusations. \"I would like to talk to some of the people who feel like I should give back my motherf**kin' trophies,\" Eddie said, impersonating the alum of \"The Cosby Show\". \"You may have heard recently that I allegedly put the pill in the people's stomach ... If I ever see or meet this Hannibal Buress in person, I am going to try and kill this man!\" During his speech, Eddie also addressed the inaccurate use of word \"Prize\" for what he received. He called the prize a \"tremendous honor\" but then asked the Keneddy Center to clear up any confusion over the prize for future recipients. \"Actually, it's an award, but they call it a prize. Usually when there's a prize, there's money,\" he said. Eddie previously refused to crack jokes about Bill in the 40th anniversary special of \" Saturday Night Live . \"Its horrible,\" he told the Washington Post. \"There's nothing funny about it. If you get up there and you crack jokes about him, you're just hurting people. You're hurting him. You're hurting his accusers. I was like, 'Hey, I'm coming back to SNL for the anniversary, I'm not turning my moment on the show into this other thing.' \" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T09:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:50:57.389+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
