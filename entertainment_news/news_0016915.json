But unlike the restless spirits that have haunted your found-footage horror franchise since 2009, it’s time for you to stay dead. \nParanormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension, in theatres now, claims it’s the final chapter in the Paranormal Activity saga (making “saga” the most diluted word since “hero.”) And while it’s actually not the worst instalment in the series, it offers so little in the way of fresh ideas and genuine scares that it’s almost possible to believe the franchise really will vanish after this. Almost. \nThe Ghost Dimension follows the Paranormal Activity sequel formula to the letter: likeable family with spirit-attuned kid is visited by ghost-demon thingies, which start by moving things around and making spooky noises, and end by, well, killing everyone. \n(It’s too bad Paranormal Activity’s spirits take so long to build up their power levels. These movies would be mercifully short if the demons just showed up and got around to their spine-snapping, body-hurling, chest-impaling business. “What’s up, family? Name’s Toby! I’m a demon, and guess what? YOU’RE ALL DEAD. Except for you, spooky kid. To be honest, you even creep me out a bit.” \nThe Ghost Dimension opens with happy young couple Ryan and Emily (Chris J. Murray and Brit Shaw) getting ready for Christmas in their new house, along with their big-eyed daughter Leila (Ivy George), Ryan’s wayward brother Mike (Dan Gill) and Skyler (Olivia Taylor Dudley), Emily’s smoking hot.... sister? Friend? Yoga instructor? It wasn’t entirely clear, not that it really matters. \nRyan and Mike come across a vintage ’80s video camera and VHS tapes apparently left by the previous owners, but there’s something unusual about this camcorder (and not just the fact it records in 16:9 aspect ratio): it can see ghostly activity not visible to the naked eye. Said spectral stirrings begin as a smoky goo hanging in the air, but in short order start to manifest into a full-on creepy demon. \nNaturally, Ryan decides to record everything in the house with the ghost camera, revealing that Leila has become besties with the evil entity and has constructed some sort of time-travelling hell portal in her bedroom. Oh, and the disturbing 1988 girl on the VHS tapes can see what’s going on in the house, too. \nIf you’ve been keeping track of the Paranormal Activity story so far – and I can’t imagine you’d be going to this movie unless you’re already so invested in the franchise that you have to see it through to the end – The Ghost Dimension ties into the characters and events of the previous films. You know who the VHS girls Katie and Kristi are and what their ultimate fates were, you how the kid Hunter factors into all this, and what Toby’s deal is. \nBut while some of the 3D effects are kind of cool, the jump scares are so heavily telegraphed that they rarely end up being frightening. If I’m already tightening my sphincter and squinting my eyes before demon-ghost-smoke-monster comes roaring through the window that the camera is lingering on, you’ve failed to scare me. Although I’ve gotten a great glutes workout in the process. \nThe Ghost Dimension has some good laughs, some of them actually intentional, and as dumb and uninspired as it is, it’s reasonably entertaining up until the final act, when everything just gets incomprehensible and all the adults are unceremoniously murdered. \nAs for it really being the last film in the franchise... it doesn’t take a magic video camera to see that Paranormal Activity will be back eventually.
