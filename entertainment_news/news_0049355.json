The tribute to Zappa — who died of cancer in 1993 at 52 — includes a rotating roster of the multi-talented late musician’s band members. Walley and Willis are playing with Project/Object for the first time since 2013.\n\"There was never a dull moment with Frank,\" Willis said in a separate interview. \"He always came up with something new musically. The degree of difficulty was so high. After Frank, there was no other music challenging enough to make me break a sweat.\"\nZappa was a pioneering, singular composer, songwriter, singer, guitarist and producer. Over the span of a 27-year career, Zappa released dozens of albums of challenging, experimental rock and jazz.\nListeners never knew what to expect from song to song: free-form jazz, garage rock broken up by off-kilter, multi-instrumental midsections and a raft of additional sounds. For instance, one of his most frenzied compositions, \"Brown Shoes Don’t Make It,\" is a 7-minute track that changes musical directions seemingly every minute.\n\"The way he approached all the different genres and put those elements in the blender made the music available to everyone,\" Walley said. \"When you have that diverse a catalog of music, you’re going to walk away loving at least some of that.\"\nLyrically, Zappa espoused individualism and railed against censorship, the government and corporate America. He released his debut album, \"Freak Out,\" in 1966. His final effort was 1993’s \"The Yellow Shark,\" released one month before his death.\nWillis and Walley played with Zappa from the late 1970s through the latter stages of his career. The duo performed on nearly every Zappa album from 1979 to 1992, including the landmark 1979 rock opera, \"Joe’s Garage.\"\nProject/Object’s show on Friday will focus on late-1970s material. The ensemble was founded in the mid-1990s by onetime Hazlet resident guitarist André Cholmondeley. Zappa alumni that have performed with Project/Object span the former’s entire career.\nWalley said that playing with Project/Object is exhilarating on a musical and personal level. \"The friendships with the other band members have remained intact,\" he said. \"Any opportunity to play together is really important and rewarding.\n\"There’s a real authority to the music when you’re playing with guys who have played with Frank,\" Walley said. \"The music sounds and feels the way it did in its original form. This is a superior band.\"\nThough some have described Zappa as a rigid taskmaster in the studio, Walley and Willis said that was not their experience. \"He had his quirks and idiosyncrasies, but he made me feel totally comfortable,\" Willis said.\n\"It was great,\" Walley said. \"I learned so much. It was like getting paid to go to college.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:34:05.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
