It’s also been 15 long years since he’s anticipated a second shot at the $1 million prize. \nBut although the 49-year-old North Carolina news anchor’s chance at the reality title was cut short this week when he was ousted from Survivor Cambodia: Second Chance , the snarky strategizer earned the title of fan-favourite and an entirely new outlook heading into the “second half” of his life. \n“I left there limping away with so much more than $1 million,” Varner told Postmedia Network following his exit episode this week that left him as the fourth person voted out of the game. “I think I played more of a game in four episodes than people who have played two full seasons and I’m very proud of myself.” \nAnd he should be. \nStraight out of the gate on the beaches of Cambodia, Jeff was responsible for numerous eliminations and had played harder as an “old-school player” than most of the young all-stars coming out of recent seasons. The game changed drastically in the past 15 years and Jeff did his best to adapt accordingly. He hit a wall however when a tribe swap pit him on a dysfunctional Angkor tribe on an abandoned beach with zero resources. \n“Doing all of that without food and sleep and having to live with Abi-Maria (Gomes) and Tasha (Fox), made it all a nightmare. When I got voted out, I was relieved in the beginning. Just, thank god that’s over. The regret settled in later but initially there was a sense of relief,” he shared. \nBut when it came time to ensure his tribe’s safety at the week’s immunity challenge, a dangerous blindfolded competition not only sent the Angkor tribe back to council for the second consecutive week, but it left Jeff seriously injured – an injury he states was downplayed by the show’s edit. “I picked up one of those blocks on my own and it was like 70 pounds but it felt like 500. It was so heavy. It just slipped right through my arms and landed on my toe. It took me out.” \nBack at camp, Varner’s injury left him limping and exposed and despite a heated battle to win over his tribe’s favour to vote out Woo Hwang instead, it was a no-brainer that Jeff’s foot was a liability and he was voted out by a count of 4-1. \n“I was living with two people, Tasha and Andrew [Savage] that put 100% of their credibility into winning a challenge, which I didn’t care for that strategy. To me, that’s not Survivor. If you want to win challenges, go to America Ninja Warrior. Survivor is a social game. People who rely on challenges are usually bad social players.” \nBut the adventure of survival isn’t over for Jeff as he recently announced the upcoming launch of a new travel adventure company in the works. “I want to take people on journeys like I went on to hopefully change their lives just like I did.” \nSurvivor Cambodia: Second Chance airs Wednesdays at 8 on CBS and Global. \nTwitter: @samomaryleona", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:11:15.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
