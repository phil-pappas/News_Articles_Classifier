Before he could even complete the question—“Rank these Kardashian-Jenners from least…”—Rose cut him off, using her first, and supposedly only, plead the fifth option. \nExcept, it wasn’t. \nBy the conclusion of the segment, Cohen said Rose did, “the worst job in the history of Watch What Happens Live playing this game.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T18:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:14:01.095+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
