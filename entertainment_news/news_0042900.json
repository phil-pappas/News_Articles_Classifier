And the fact that we no longer have that, that’s the thing that saddens me the most because in a few generations the Huxtables will have been just a fairy tale,” said Warner, who starred as Cosby’s son, Theo Huxtable, on the long-running NBC sitcom. \n“The legacy can’t help but be tarnished. …’The Cosby Show’ was part of the fiber of American culture so to see that, to see that the show doesn’t necessarily have the same sheen that it once did, is definitely a downer,” he said. \nWarner said he has been in touch with Cosby, but he would not comment on their conversations.
