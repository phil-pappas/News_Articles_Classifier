She reportedly is learning to play the piano as she plans to make a return to music with a duet alongside rapper husband Kanye West . The Sun was first to report the news. \"Kim is excited about the collaboration and has even been learning the piano,\" a US music insider told The Sun newspaper (via Mirror Online). \"Kanye plans to release the song just after Kim has their second child.\" The high profile couple is expected to welcome their second child, a baby boy, in December later this year. Back in 2011, Kim dropped the tune \"Jam (Turn It Up)\", featuring background vocals by producer The-Dream . Half of the proceeds from the sales of the song were donated to a children's charity. Music aside, Kim hosted a Troop Beverly Hills-themed baby shower for her friends and family to attend over the weekend. She was joined for the shower by sisters Kourtney Kardashian , Khloe Kardashian , Kendall Jenner , and Kylie Jenner . \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T16:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:00:56.371+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
