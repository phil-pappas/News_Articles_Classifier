Do the names Francis Gary Powers and Rudolf Abel ring any bells? And in a related question, does U-2 register as anything non-musical? The story of what went on in the late-1950s and early-1960s, when Russian spy Rudolf Abel was convicted of espionage on U.S. soil, and American spy Gary Powers, flying a U-2 reconnaissance plane, was shot down over Russian territory and convicted of espionage, seems to have been forgotten. Steven Spielbergs Bridge of Spies refers, in title, to the Glienicke Bridge in Berlin, where after a lengthy negotiation and much political brinksmanship, the American and Soviet Union governments were hoping to pull off a trade, in which the Americans would get their spy back home, as would the Russians. The story of what happened on that bridge would have been fascinating enough, but the film goes back, in terrifically constructed script, to tell the events that led up to it and they, too, hit that degree of fascination. It opens in 1957, with the Cold War going strong, and FBI agents breaking into the home of Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance), who was suspected of dealing with nuclear secrets. It jumps to the lawyer James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks), whos in the middle of a liability case. For a reason thats not explained, Donovans boss (Alan Alda) chooses him to defend the Soviet spy. But Im an insurance lawyer, says Donovan. But his boss tells him its his patriotic duty to defend the son of a bitch, thereby proving that everyone can get a fair shake in America. A trademark of most Spielberg films is to show problems within families. During that time of Cold War paranoia and flag-waving but mindless patriotism, Donovans wife Mary (Amy Ryan) fears for their familys safety if he goes through with it. But then the film jumps to Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) being picked, along with other Air Force members, to become drivers, who will pilot newly designed U-2 planes over the Soviet Union to gather intelligence. You work for the CIA now, theyre told. You cant be shot down. You cant be captured. Later, theyre given rations of suicide pills in case that happens. Let the tension begin. Donovan is followed CIA agents who demand, illegally to know what Abel is telling him. There are threats to him and his family. Abel is found guilty. The U-2 training program goes into high gear. Theres talk of a life sentence versus a death sentence for Abel, but Donovan presciently says to his superiors that Abel should be kept alive in case we need to trade for him some day. A couple of years go by. The U-2 planes take off, and in a fantastic, absolutely terrifying sequence in May, 1960, Powers is shot down over Russian air space. He was captured, found guilty of spying, sent to prison. Now its CIA head Allen Dulles (Peter McRobbie) who calls Donovan into his office and asks him to negotiate a spy swap with the Soviets. Hold on, theres yet another story to be told. As all of this was going on, the wall between East and West Berlin was going up, and an American student named Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers), totally innocent, but caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, was arrested by the East German government, and would become a lesser, but still key figure in the ensuing events. Page 2 of 2 - Theres a lot of story to tell here, but theres also some superb acting. The best of it is in the subtle scenes between Hanks and Rylance, as they calmly discuss Abels case. Both men give wonderfully low-key performances. But theres also that script. It started out as a strong one by first-timer Matt Charman, and with Spielbergs blessing, was fleshed out by Ethan and Joel Coen (yes, the Coen brothers), who made it darker with the help of some biting humor. Spielbergs serious films (Lincoln, Schindlers List) tend to be word-heavy. This one certainly is, but none of them are wasted, and this remains a quiet, tense thriller right to the end.
