But Wales know full-well what Foley is capable of, having watched him bury them with an 18-point haul as man of the match in last year’s 33-28 victory in Cardiff.\n“He’s a real threat at the moment,” Wales coach Warren Gatland said of Foley, who kicked seven from seven against England.\n“His relationship with (halfback Will) Genia has developed.\n“(He’s) a player we’re conscious will pose us problems. We will look to shut him down as much as we can, try to pressure him. “He brings players in often and is a real threat.\n“His goalkicking has been pretty good too.”\nThere is belief amongst the Australians too that Foley is can continue his hot form.\nVeteran centre Matt Giteau said the 26-year-old was relishing the challenge being presented by Biggar and Wales.\nFOLLOW ALL THE BUILD-UP AND LIVE ACTION IN OUR BLOG BELOW!\nMatt Giteau scored a try against England, but will have his hands full in the midfield marking Jamie Roberts. Last year, Giteau watched from the sidelines and provided expert commentary for TV as Foley orchestrated a win that extended the Wallabies’ streak to 10 over Wales.\n“They know what he’s capable of,” Giteau said.\n“It’s going to be a big test for him against Biggar who I think has been a really big player so far in the tournament.\n“He’s played some great football, not just in attack — defensively he’s quite solid as well.\n“That will be another big test for Nard (Foley).”\nGiteau, meanwhile, is also bracing for a tough outing against a monster Welsh midfield of Jamie Roberts and George North, the power-running winger who has been shifted infield to get him more involved.\nThe 110kg Roberts will line up at inside centre, opposite Giteau, in another anticipated energy-sapping clash for the 98-Test Wallaby.\n“With the centre combination they’ve picked, they use Roberts for their go-forward,” Giteau said.\n“They’ve brought North in to get a little bit more ball, he probably hasn’t seen as much as he would’ve liked in their first few games and he’s obliviously a dangerous runner.\n“They obviously see it as an effective weapon against Australia.”\nNew podcast!
