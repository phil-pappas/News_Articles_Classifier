That’s the largest global audience for a live broadcast of any title in National Theatre Live history. \nThe broadcast played on over 1,400 screens and in 25 countries. \nSince its launch in 2009, National Theatre broadcasts from England have included “Frankenstein” with Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller, Sam Mendes’“King Lear,” and “A Streetcar Named Desire” with Gillian Anderson. \nAfter a performance in August, Cumberbatch told fans gathered outside that spotting filming while performing was “mortifying.” \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T01:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:19:25.113+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
