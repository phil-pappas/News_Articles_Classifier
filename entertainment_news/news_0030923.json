Salman's great, Shah Rukh, Bachchan saab (Amitabh Bachchan), they all are like really really good at commanding the kind of shows that they have chosen,\" Bipasha told PTI.\nThe \"No Entry\" actress will be seen hosting the mini-series as well as starring in as herself.\nBipasha says she did not take any inspiration from the trio as the format of the show is different.\n\"Our format is very different. I am still playing Bipasha Basu. So I don't have to take it from anyone else but myself. I am the way I am going to be. So the integration is very unique and hasn't been done in India by any celebrity.\"\nBipasha, however, insists she will not be seen as a \"regular\" host on the horror show which will premiere on &TV on October 31.\n\"It is hosting but it's not like the regular Tele prompter reading... I never wanted to do that. I hate that... The makers have used me well on each episode. It's like being Bipasha yet enacting a scene which threads the entire film.\"\nEach episode of the series will be helmed by various directors like Suparn Verma, of Bipasha-Nawazuddin starter horror \"Aatma\", Soumik Sen and Sangeeth Sivan of \"Apna Sapna Money Money\".\n\"These are episodes which are like short films. It's a take by individual directors who will get to showcase their take on TV. It'll be every director's take on fear. And I get to integrate it and be the face of the show.\"\nThe \"Jism\" star says she jumped at the opportunity to be the face of the show as it will have better \"special effects, production values, directors, actors and content.\"\nBipasha has been a part of horror films like \"Raaz 3\" and \"Alone\", but the actress says she chose TV as a medium this time as it has a wider reach.\n\"With TV you reach out to maximum number of people... Hence we do guest appearances on reality shows and fictions... We are always on TV for promotion. It is just another change of medium.\nThe number of people are more in TV but nothing changes otherwise.\"\nThe show will be aired on Saturdays and Sundays.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:07:35.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
