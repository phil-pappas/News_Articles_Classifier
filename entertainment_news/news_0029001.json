Posted today at 2:00pm \nCliff Lipson/CBS (LONDON) -- Well, that was a surprise. Reports out of the U.K. suggest that during tonight's telecast of The X Factor, Adele unveiled a new single from her long-awaited new album. \nA video of a TV shows a black screen, followed by the words, \"Hello, it's me/I was wondering if, after all these years/you'd like to meet and go over everything/They say that time's supposed to heal ya/But I ain't done much healing.\" That's followed by three ellipses, as if to say \"to be continued.\" A voice is heard singing those words, and it sure does sound like Adele -- and the lyrics definitely seem like something she'd sing. \nFollowing the airing of the thirty-second spot, OneRepublic tweeted , \"Adele\" with a smiley face. OneRepublic's frontman Ryan Tedder is one person who's publicly confirmed that he worked on her new album, so if he thinks it's her, it likely is. \nWhile there are rumors that Adele's follow-up to her album 21 is due next month, there's been no official confirmation or announcement. This, however, seems to suggest that what the singer's fans have been waiting for is finally happening: new music is coming. \nA rep for Adele tells ABC Radio he has \"no comment\" on the alleged debut. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
