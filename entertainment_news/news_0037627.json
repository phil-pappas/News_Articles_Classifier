Creative Talent Scholarship awards the best and brightest of film students across Europe with a bursary for study as well as experience and knowledge in the film industry.\nIn its second year, the scholarship gives film students a chance to hone their craft and support themselves whilst gaining the experience of a short paid placement at Warner Bros. Ireland’s Dublin offices. They'll also have access to screenings and mentoring support from Warner Bros. executives in the country.\nThis year's scholarship was awarded to Ciaran Dooley, an MA Screenwriting student in the National Film School at IADT. \"We're absolutely delighted that Warner Bros. has renewed its commitment to the NFS in general and our MA Screenwriting programme in particular. Ciarán is one of a group of extremely talented students here at IADT and we're confident that he will take this opportunity to progress a very promising career,\" said Donald Taylor Black, Creative Director of NFS.\nThe Irish scholarship is an extension of Warner Bros. Creative Talent, a key part of Warner Bros. long-term investment in UK creative industry skills and training. Announced in 2013, Warner Bros. Creative Talent’s multi-layered investment encompasses scholarships at some of the UK's most respected higher education institutions, apprenticeships with roles ranging from set-lighting to post-production and trainee positions on every Warner Bros.' UK film production.\nMORE: Daniel Craig says he's NOT done with James Bond just yet\nMORE: Robert DeNiro reteaming with Joe Pesci, Al Pacino & Martin Scorsese for I Heard You Paint Houses\nMORE: Watch: The first trailer for Ip Man 3 sees Donnie Yen take on Mike Tyson (Yes, really)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T18:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:37:34.980+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
