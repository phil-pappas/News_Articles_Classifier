Nearly 50 years later, the story of a modern-day Romeo and Juliet caught in a cross-cultural crossfire of gang conflict is still resonant and relevant, especially in the capable hands of the Fiddlehead Theater Company, performing the classic at the Strand Theater in Dorchester. Boston and Broadway veteran Stacey Stephens directs a diverse cast of talented actors. From leads to ensemble, the company includes professionals from across the country, with many that have performed in regional and national touring productions, with one (Waldemar Quinones-Villanueva as Bernardo) who appeared in “West Side Story” on Broadway and in its first national tour. You can’t help but be struck by every actor’s ability to express themselves individually even though they perform collectively. Each Shark, Jet and Girl establishes an indelible persona that emerges during the early musical dance selections. “Jet Song,” featuring Riff (Theo Lencicki) and the Jets enthusiastically declaring their love and fidelity for their brotherhood. In the astonishingly and superbly presented “Dance at the Gym” (entire company), that mixes the pomp and flair of a high school dance with the obvious tension between the Puerto Rican Sharks and the white Jets, it becomes evident that there are many stars in this show. And, every of them can dance, interpreting Wendy Hall’s choreography with style and authority. Still, as the unexpected thunderbolt of love casts itself upon Tony (Jeffrey Zicker) and Maria (Kim Corbett) at the end of the dance, it becomes clear that the lead actors are quite capable of literally emerging from the crowd. Corbett radiates the qualities that Robbins and book writer Laurents doubtlessly had in mind when they conceived “West Side Story” (with credit to William Shakespeare for the creation of Juliet Capulet). She respects her family and heritage, but has enough truth and confidence to know and respect love when it happens. Corbett is an evocative actress with a powerfully affecting singing voice. It’s not difficult to comprehend Tony’s passion for her. As Tony, Zicker immediately conveys maturity, determination and optimism, three things his old friends lack. He captivates throughout, but grabs our attention in the first act while performing two of Bernstein’s well know compositions (with lyrics by Sondheim –“Something’s Coming” and “Maria.” Corbett and Zicker are pure magic singing together in “Tonight” and “One Hand on Heart.” Pamela Turpen (Anita) not only leads her Latina friends in a rousing version of “America” to provide a lighthearted yet enlightening number in the first act, she also captivates as Maria’s very strong, but less open-minded friend. Her performance of “A Boy Like That” with Corbett is riveting and expressive in a heart-rending situation. There are many astounding moments in “West Side Story,” times when every aspect of the performance (singing, dancing, acting, costumes, set design and music) meld together to produce an uncommon theater experience. In addition to the “Dance at the Gym,” these would include “Somewhere,” and “Tonight”– they are truly blissful. Yet, as you know going in, the joy is tempered by violence and heartbreak. Trust that those aspects are handled just as deftly. John Davin (Doc and Gladhand) is wonderful and likeable in both roles. Daniel Boudreau is appropriately despicable and sleazy as Lieutenant Schrank. Bryan Miner sets up the boy’s buoyant attempt to shake off the tragic events of the previous evening and lessen the dark mood in Act Two (“Officer Krupke”). Stephen’s chooses to dress the Jets in black and the Sharks in white, with a Fifties flair (high waists, high water pants, slick hair, some leather jackets and sneakers. This creates a visual contrast that becomes even clearer when all characters appear in color for “Somewhere.” With its high proscenium, subtle lighting effects and impressionistic dissolving brick backdrop and scaffolding that juts into the audience, the stage and lighting add to the transformative atmosphere, helping to make Fiddlehead’s “West Side Story” a singular experience.
