Rowling's Harry Potter stage show focuses on the grown-up wizard and his youngest son as he starts school at Hogwarts. \nThe British writer announced in June that she was working on two-part play Harry Potter and the Cursed Child with writer Jack Thorne and director John Tiffany, but they kept plot details under wraps. \nIt has now been revealed that the show will pick up where her final book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, finished, with Harry and his wife Ginny Weasley sending their children off to Hogwarts in an epilogue, which is set 19 years after the main events. \nThe new production will focus on Harry as \"an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic\" and father of three who is grappling \"with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs\" and his youngest son Albus Severus and his first year at Hogwarts. \nThe synopsis reads, \"His youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places.\" \nThe show, which will be told in two parts on separate nights, will open for previews on June 7 at London's Palace Theatre. \nCasting has kicked off, and rehearsals will begin in February and March.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T18:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:00:07.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
