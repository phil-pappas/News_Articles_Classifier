We talked to Leakes about leaving the show, the presidential race and her upcoming projects -- including one with Betty White. We also caught up with Leakes on her involvement in Atlanta's LGBT community: The reality star is hosting the Barefoot Wine Bear Garten Pride Celebration in The Piedmont Room in Atlanta Thursday night.\nHow is life now that you're not a \"Real Housewife\"?\nI feel like I'm happier. When you work in a lot of negativity, it becomes a part of who you are and I feel like I'm getting back to me, myself and I. It's happy and free. It's been a refreshing time away from the girls. I've done [the show] every season for eight years so I really needed to have a break. I'm not saying I would never ever go back, but it was good to step away.\nThat makes it sound like you're thinking about returning. Are you?\nNo. I'm a part of the Bravo family. I love Bravo, they love me -- I have a great relationship with Andy Cohen. Everybody over there loves me. We all have a good relationship. I started the show and I'd go back whenever I felt like going back. I just don't ever want to say never.\nPlay Video CBS This Morning Andy Cohen on \"Real Housewives,\" celebrities and new book The man who created the \"Real Housewives\" franchise now hosts the late-night talk show, \"Watch What Happens Live.\" Andy Cohen joins \"CBS This Mor...\nHow did you know that it was time for you to leave?\nThe whole time I was doing season 7, I was just dying. I was like, \"Oh my God. I can't take it anymore.\" To me, when I really, really was like \"This is it\" was when I walked into scenes and the girls would just focus on me as if they wanted to argue with me.\nYou have said before that you and Donald Trump are very fond of each other. What do you think about his campaign?\nDonald and I had a great relationship when I was on \"Celebrity Apprentice.\" He and I talked when I shot my wedding show and he came on and did a scene. I think he's doing amazing and gaining a lot of momentum. I think he's funny as s**t. I never watched a debate before till I watched his. He's funny. He keeps it real. I love all those things about him. That said, I'm not voting for him. I'm not a Republican and I have my eyes set somewhere else.\nWill you say who that is?\nNope.\nTonight you're kicking of Atlanta's Gay Pride Celebration with Barefoot Wine & Bubbly. Tell me more on your relationship with the LGBT community in Atlanta.\nI love the LGBT community and I've been a fan for a very, very long time. I have friends who are part of the community. I grew up in high school with a gay guy and he and I were such besties. What I love most is they're just being themselves and who they really are. I love being who I am, too, and that's what really attracted me to the LGBT community in the first place.\nTonight I am partnering with Barefoot Wine & Bubbly for a big celebration here to kick off Gay Pride. It's Barefoot's first time doing this in Atlanta. We're going to have huge performances with a lot of drag queens -- some of them are from \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" and we're going to have an amazing time.\nYou're going to host a show next year called \"To Tell The Truth\" with Betty White. What can we expect to see?\nIt's going to be an amazing show. It comes out in the new year. Anthony Anderson is hosting it, Betty White is on the panel, myself and Jalen Rose. It's the same as the old show \"To Tell the Truth\" -- they revamped it and we turned it into something that's a little hilarious.\nHow do you like working with Betty?\nBetty looks good for her age. She is so funny. I wear a lot of heels and different shoes and I will walk in on set every day and she says, \"Come here, come here. Let me see your shoes. Those are amazing!\" And she has her ballerina slippers on. She's so easy and quiet, but she's really a good, fun lady.\nYou posted a photo on Twitter the other day with \"The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.\"\nI'm in L.A. all the time and I happened to be in Malibu and I ran into the Beverly Hills housewives and drank and laughed about the franchises with them. When we do that, I think, \"Oh it's not so negative,\" but it's because we don't work together everyday, so it's easy to be together and laugh and have drinks. It was fun. It was great meeting those girls.", "external_links": ["http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/12/01/b9e126d2-908f-4ed1-b5c3-1cae5a5a3868/thumbnail/220x140/5120c6bfba646bd381dc63fe85bc128f/ctm1201andycohendiaries314759640x360.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:56:53.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
