Like a pitching staff with five aces, \"Fargo\" (10 p.m., FX, TV-MA) is so rich in interesting characters that it's easy to overlook some real talents. This adaptation of the Coen brothers' classic, now in it's second season, also marks the return of Kirsten Dunst to episodic television. Most famous for the wildly popular \"Spider-Man\" franchise, she has also worked in such experimental cult favorites as Sofia Coppola's \"Marie Antoinette\" and Lars von Trier's \"Melancholia.\" \"Fargo\" has always been about the desperate acts of seemingly minor characters. What drives Dunst's Peggy Blomquist to such disturbing choices? Is she really honest with her husky hubby, Ed (Jesse Plemons), a man whose modest ambitions seem so at odds with her thirst for encounter group self-fulfillment? And how, or rather, why, did she think she could cover up her accident outside the Waffle Hut? At first, Peggy seems like just another casserole-loving Midwestern cliche. But in her own quiet and determined way, she could be the Lady Macbeth who sets this tragedy in motion. — Not enough can be written about the off-kilter musical comedy \"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\" (8 p.m., CW, TV-14). A show this original has a way of not surviving. So cherish it while you can. At the same time, \"Crazy Ex\" represents a fascinating development in the history of musical comedy. The show's irrepressible star, Rachel Bloom, was born in 1987, making her just 2 when Disney's animated feature \"The Little Mermaid\" introduced musical theater sensibilities to an entire new generation that was all but raised on \"Beauty and the Beast,\" \"Aladdin\" and \"The Lion King.\" Round about the time Bloom and her contemporaries became teens, musical theater was reinvented again. Knowing irony replaced romance, and unlikely \"composers,\" including Mel Brooks and later Trey Parker and Matt Stone, conquered Broadway with \"The Producers\" and \"The Book of Mormon.\" On TV, \"The Simpsons\" and \"Family Guy\" laced musical numbers with sardonic, sarcastic and occasionally sophisticated elements. \"Crazy Ex\" reflects a life marinated in musicals as well as a spirit liberated by the advent of YouTube and viral videos, a medium that allowed and encouraged everyone to perform. The songs come from every direction, reflecting a wide spectrum of musical genres while expressing aspects of female fear, desire and emotions rarely associated with song and dance. This near-universally praised comedy was watched by fewer than a million people in its debut. Maybe its core audience is waiting to watch, or stream it, elsewhere. I sure hope an audience shows up. \"Crazy Ex- Girlfriend\" is a show worth saving. And savoring.
