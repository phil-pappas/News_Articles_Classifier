Tajh Spikes, has already filled 2015 with new music. His latest is a mixtape with remixes of songs from Pimp C and Big K.R.I.T., released in September. Better still are his collaborations with A.D.D. Beats. Just this year, Spikes released a full-length, called “Enjoy,” which shows his taste in stellar beats and rhymes as shown on songs like “Rain.” Going through Spikes’ catalog, you realize he’s throwing everything on the canvas, hoping anything sticks. In some cases, not everything works. The more modern pop-rap doesn’t fit Spikes’ style. But when he works with an old school sample and simpler beat, he sounds like a lost East Coast gem. Adam Dollar$ — The Vapor$ EP \nAlready getting the call to open for big name acts like Mystikal at The Varsity, Adam Dollar$ could be just what the Baton Rouge hip-hop scene needs. On his debut five-song release, “The Vapor$ EP,” the young rapper freestyles circles around you. It takes a couple listens, but once you grab a hold of his lyrical merry-go-round, you realize just how good this kid is. On “Spark It Off,” he sounds like a young, angry Pharoahe Monch. The beats are something from the Definitive Jux era. Live, Dollar$ lets the music breathe with a huge band, filled out by keys, sax, bass, guitar and drums. More please. ASKTHETHOMASBROS — 02 \nTwin brothers Thurman and Torrence Thomas are a supreme networking duo. Musically, on their second release under the moniker ASKTHETHOMASBROS, the brothers give out two songs of Prince-like funk and modern-era R&B. The synths squeal, and the bass stutters on “Feels Good To Write.” On “Dangerous Love,” the band goes into pop radio territory, with a bare beat, a simple reprise and style for days. \nFollow Matthew Sigur on Twitter @MatthewSigur .
