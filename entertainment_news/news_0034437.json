Related Media VAIL — International wine professional Jose “Nacho” Ignacio Andres Benito will host a Moro Spanish wine dinner at La Tour restaurant in Vail Village today at 7:30 p.m. Benito will pour NV Castellroig Brut Cava, 2013 Hito C21 Ribera del Duero and 2011 Emilio Moro Ribera del Duero. “Nacho, who has been with this company for so long, is traveling around the country right now and he’s kind of a character, so since he was coming into Vail, we thought, why not try to do a dinner with him?” said La Tour chef-owner Paul Ferzacca “My sommelier really loves Spanish wines, so it works out great.” Sommelier Ian Gray will pair each wine with autumn cuisine prepared by Ferzacca. To create the menu for a wine-pairing dinner, the duo often tastes the wine together prior to the event, Ferzacca said. “When you’ve been in the business for 35 years and you have an advanced sommelier who’s been doing it for as long as he’s been doing it, him and I talking together, we can come up with what’s going to be a good pairing,” he said. “I’m also a certified sommelier, so when you taste as much wine as we taste, you can pretty much know what to pair with any particular wine.” Reservations are recommended for the dinner, which includes three courses with wine pairings, plus dessert with Spanish coffee, for $60, plus tax and gratuity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:17:46.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
