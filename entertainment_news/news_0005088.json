Hot dogs, yummy soups, chili, sausage-peppers-onion sandwiches and hot turkey sandwiches are on the menu,” said Barb Cona, executive director of BHF. “There will be plenty of fall foods to tempt your taste buds: caramel apples, fall-flavored ice cream, funnel cakes, apple fritters, fudge and much more. For the adults we have some fall beers coming your way along with a terrific selection of wine.” \nChildren are encouraged to wear Halloween costumes, and bags will be available for collecting treats from vendors. A petting zoo, pony rides, hayrides and a pumpkin decorating booth will also be available for kids. \nA few fall-inspired competitions will give the event a real seasonal feel. An apple pie bake-off will include the first 10 entries. Advance registration is required, and each contestant will need to submit two pies (one for tasting and one for show) made entirely from scratch. \nAn apple pie-eating contest will include a limit of six contestants per category. Age groups consist of 10- to 15-year-olds; 16- to 21-year-olds; 22- to 54-year-olds; and anyone 55 years old and older. Prizes will be given to the winner in each age group. \nA scarecrow contest for anyone interested will allow participants to use their creativity to represent their business, family or themselves. A $100 prize will be awarded for the best overall winner. Registration is free, but advance registration is required. \nA variety of Beach Haven merchants will also offer a range of goods from fall spices, clothing and crafts to home-baked goods, Halloween costumes for pets and Christmas ornaments. \nJake’s Rockin Country Band will provide live entertainment from noon to 4:30. \n“Beach Haven Future wanted an event to celebrate the change of season on LBI, and the Fall Festival will be a festive event that will continue to grow over the years,” Cona said. “The town’s 125th anniversary gave us the perfect time to kick this into high gear. We are beyond excited.” \nFestival-goers can bring their own chairs, but no pets are allowed. \nFor more information, visit beachhavenfuture.com and check the organization’s Facebook page. —K.A.E.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T22:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:51:35.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
