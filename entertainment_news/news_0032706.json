In just five days, the video has passed 1 million views and sparked a new movement and organization – the American Coalition for Responsible Gun Ownership.\nFrom his home in Portsmouth, Virginia, Carman now finds himself at the center of a rapidly growing group of gun owners and non-owners, liberals and conservatives, religious and non-religious citizens of all backgrounds who are “one voice, one community, one nation united by a common desire: to protect Constitutional rights and public safety through responsible gun ownership.\"\n“I love my guns,” says Carman. “This is a message to responsible firearm owners: At some point, we’re going to have to come to the conclusion that we’re going to need to get guns away from people who shouldn’t have them.”\nCarman’s voice comes as a welcome relief to many U.S. gun owners, many of whom do not feel fully represented by either the NRA or many gun-reform advocacy groups. Posts of gratitude and offers to help have poured in from Americans across the country who want to preserve their right to bear arms while also ensuring public safety.\n“I’m going to make some noise,” says Carman. He has plenty of ideas about how to address the problem of gun violence, but established ACRGO to provide a platform for moderate voices. If you are ready to make some noise, too, join the movement and spread the word. As Carman says, \"Civil discourse is vastly different from civil disturbance. We want discourse and we want our voice to be heard\"\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13013743.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/ResponsibleGuns", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13013743.htm"], "published": "2015-10-09T18:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:04:06.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
