We never did drugs, we didn't get involved in any mad, crazy shit or anything like that.\n\"I think we were generally clean enough individuals anyway because our mums and dads would've killed us if we weren't. Louis (Walsh) was always very strict with us to a certain degree. He always reminded us how lucky we were,\" Filan, 36, said.\nThe singer credited Walsh for keeping them united and not letting them spoil their lives.\n\"He'd be always watching everything. He had disciples out listening to us. It was crazy how much he knew about our lives outside work hours, but that's what a good manager does. He kept us together as a band, that's his job.\"\nListen to Shane Filan on Gaana.com\nThe band parted ways in 2012 after releasing ten albums.\nWATCH: Shane Filan - Knee Deep In My Hear", "external_links": ["http://gaana.com/album/everything-to-me-english-2013", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/uZT_1gP8SVM"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:47:04.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
