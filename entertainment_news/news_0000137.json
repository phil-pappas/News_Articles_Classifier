Jeanne Yurman reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript \nBelgian designer Dries Van Noten's Spring/Summer collection exploded into Fashion Week in Paris Wednesday. His ready-to-wear pieces were a clash of color and patterns mirrored by jarring music performed live in an industrial hangar. Van Noten explains his designs. (SOUNDBITE) (English) BELGIAN FASHION DESIGNER, DRIES VAN NOTEN, SAYING: \"The idea was to do it sophisticated and raw at the same time so bicolor prints, or two tone prints that when you clash them together they make an even bigger shock than when you have multicolored things.\" The designer said he imagined the woman who would wear bras on top of her shirts or skirts with too much tulle -- and do so during the day. (SOUNDBITE) (English) BELGIAN FASHION DESIGNER, DRIES VAN NOTEN, SAYING: \"She's really flamboyant. For me that was the starting word of this collection, that she enjoys life, she wears and she dares.\" Van Noten's collection included a nod to the forties reflected in gloves and vintage sunglasses. The ready-to-wear fashion week in Paris runs until October 7. Upcoming shows include Dior, Chloe and Chanel.
