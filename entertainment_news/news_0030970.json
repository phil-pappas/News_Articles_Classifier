Adjusted and reported earnings per share reflect the negative impact from changes in currency exchange rates of $0.20.\n- Board declared 2015 fourth quarter cash dividend of $0.38 per share, which is flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2014.\nEL SEGUNDO, Calif. , Oct. 15, For the third quarter of 2015, Mattel, Inc. (NASDAQ: MAT) today reported worldwide net sales down 4% in constant currency, adjusted operating income of $321.6 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.71 .\n\"Our results for the quarter, excluding the significant impact from currency exchange rates, were broadly in line with our expectations at this stage of our turnaround,\" said Christopher Sinclair , Mattel Chairman and CEO. \"Importantly, we're very encouraged by the progress we are making on reenergizing the company, building momentum in our core brands, improving retail execution, reducing costs and building scale in key emerging markets. As we continue our turnaround efforts, we remain comfortable with our full-year outlook.\"\nFinancial Overview\nFor the quarter, worldwide net sales were down 4% in constant currency compared to last year. In the North American Region, which consists of the United States , Canada and American Girl, third quarter gross sales decreased by 4% in constant currency, and 5% as reported. In the International Region, gross sales decreased by 2% in constant currency, and decreased 19% as reported. Adjusted gross margin decreased 170 basis points and 140 basis points as reported, primarily from the negative impact from changes in currency exchange rates. Adjusted other selling and administrative expenses decreased $30 million , reflecting continued cost improvement initiatives. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $321.6 million , compared to prior year's adjusted operating income of $434.5 million , reflecting the negative impact from changes in currency exchange rates and lower sales, partially offset by lower other selling and administrative expenses.\nThe Company's debt-to-total capital ratio as of September 30, 2015 was 46.8%.\nCash flows used for operating activities were approximately $222 million , compared to approximately $144 million in 2014. Cash flows used for investing activities were approximately $206 million , a decrease of approximately $398 million , primarily due to the prior-year acquisition of MEGA Brands. Cash flows used for financing activities and other were approximately $254 million , compared to approximately $29 million in 2014. The change was primarily driven by prior year net proceeds from long-term borrowings, partially offset by prior year share repurchases.\nCapital Deployment\nThe Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter cash dividend of $0.38 per share, which is flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. The dividend will be payable on December 11, 2015 to stockholders of record on November 25, 2015 .\nSales by Brand\nMattel Girls and Boys Brands\nFor the third quarter, worldwide gross sales for Mattel Girls & Boys Brands were $1.12 billion , down 5% in constant currency versus the prior year. Worldwide gross sales for the Barbie brand were down 4% in constant currency. Year-to-date retail sales for Barbie are up slightly on a global basis, driven by strong performance in the United States , partially offset by a decline in international markets. Worldwide gross sales for Other Girls brands were down 20% in constant currency. Worldwide gross sales for the Wheels category, which includes the Hot Wheels and Matchbox ® brands, were up 19% in constant currency. Worldwide gross sales for the Entertainment business, which includes Radica ® and Games, were down 4% in constant currency.\nFisher-Price Brands\nThird quarter worldwide gross sales for Fisher-Price Brands, which includes the Fisher-Price Core, Fisher-Price Friends and Power Wheels ® brands, were $625.3 million , up 1% in constant currency versus the prior year.\nAmerican Girl Brands\nThird quarter gross sales for American Girl Brands, which offers American Girl-branded products directly to consumers, were $109.9 million , down 2% in constant currency versus the prior year.\nConstruction and Arts & Crafts Brands\nThird quarter gross sales for Construction and Arts & Crafts Brands, which includes the MEGA BLOKS ® and RoseArt ® brands, were $118.5 million , up 2% in constant currency versus the prior year.

To listen to the live call, log in to the website at least 15 minutes early to register, download and install any necessary audio software. An archive of the webcast will be available on the company's website for 90 days and may be accessed beginning two hours after the completion of the live call.

The passcode is 39720076.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements on a variety of matters. These forward-looking statements are based on currently available operating, financial, economic and other information and are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties. A variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, could cause actual future results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Some of these factors are described in the Company's periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the \"Risk Factors\" section of Mattel's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 and Mattel's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for fiscal year 2015, as well as in Mattel's other public statements. Mattel does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement the financial results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"), Mattel discloses certain non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release include gross sales, adjusted gross margin, adjusted other selling and administrative expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted earnings (loss) per share and constant currency. Mattel uses these metrics to analyze its continuing operations and to monitor, assess and identify meaningful trends in its operating and financial performance, and are discussed in more detail below. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the attached exhibits and also will be available at the time of our conference call and webcast (information above) in the \"Investors\" section of our corporate website, http://corporate.mattel.com/ , under the subheading \"Financial Information – Earnings Releases.\"\nGross sales\nGross sales represent sales to customers, excluding the impact of sales adjustments. Net sales, as reported, include the impact of sales adjustments, such as trade discounts and other allowances. Mattel presents changes in gross sales as a metric for comparing its aggregate, brand and geographic results to highlight significant trends in Mattel's business. Changes in gross sales are discussed because, while Mattel records the detail of such sales adjustments in its financial accounting systems at the time of sale, such sales adjustments are generally not associated with individual products, making net sales less meaningful.\nAdjusted gross margin\nAdjusted gross margin represents Mattel's reported gross profit, adjusted to exclude the impact of inventory fair value markup above cost associated with the acquisition of a business, as a percentage of net sales. Adjusted gross margin is presented to provide additional perspective on underlying trends in Mattel's core gross margin.\nAdjusted other selling and administrative expenses\nAdjusted other selling and administrative expenses represents Mattel's reported other selling and administrative expenses, adjusted to exclude the impact of expenses associated with the acquisition and integration of an acquired business and restructuring and restructuring-related expenses. Adjusted other selling and administrative expenses is presented to provide additional perspective on underlying trends in Mattel's core other selling and administrative expenses.\nAdjusted operating income\nAdjusted operating income represents Mattel's reported operating income, adjusted to exclude the impact of inventory fair value markup above cost associated with the acquisition of a business, expenses associated with the acquisition and integration of an acquired business and the impact of restructuring and restructuring-related expenses. Adjusted operating income is presented to provide additional perspective on underlying trends in Mattel's core operating results.\nAdjusted earnings (loss) per share\nAdjusted earnings per share represents Mattel's reported diluted earnings per common share, adjusted to exclude the impact of inventory fair value markup above cost associated with the acquisition of a business, expenses associated with the acquisition and integration of an acquired business, the impact of restructuring and restructuring-related expenses and certain tax benefits. Each adjustment is tax effected, if necessary, and divided by the reported weighted average number of common and potential common shares to determine the per-share impact of the adjustment. Adjusted earnings per share is presented to provide additional perspective on underlying trends in Mattel's core earnings.\nConstant currency\nPercentage changes in results expressed in constant currency are presented excluding the impact from changes in currency exchange rates. To present this information, current period and prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than US dollar are translated to US dollars using consistent exchange rates, rather than using the actual exchange rate in effect during the respective periods. The difference between the current period and prior period results using the consistent exchange rates reflects the changes in the underlying performance results, excluding the impact from changes in currency exchange rates. Mattel analyzes constant currency results to provide additional perspective on underlying trends in Mattel's operating performance.\nAbout Mattel\nThe Mattel family of companies (Nasdaq: MAT) is a worldwide leader in the design, manufacture and marketing of toys and family products.
