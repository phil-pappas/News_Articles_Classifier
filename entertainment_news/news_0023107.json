Pic/Atul Kamble \n\"I don't like to follow the norm - the typical way of doing things. I've never done it and I like to be a little unpredictable. But the only predictability in my case has been that I am still supporting and encouraging a genre (horror) which has still not got its due respect.\n\"It's a genre which is still experimental but very exciting so I am supporting what I am good at,\" Bipasha said here on Tuesday regarding her horror show 'Darr Sabko Lagta Hai'.\nWhy did she choose horror to begin her journey on television?\n\"I didn't want to do the predictable dance and music reality judging show which is also a lot of fun to see. And I think this (horror) is right up my alley, it's my home turf... horror and it's a genre which needs encouragement,\" she added.\nThe show will be aired from October 31 on &TV.\nBipasha will be playing herself in the show and her part has been directed by \"Go Goa Gone\" directors Raj Nidimoru and Krishna D.K.\nAbout 'Darr Sabko Lagta Hai', she said: \"It's got a very modern and contemporary take on horror. It's not something that you've seen - the style of shooting, the directors who have been roped in to make these short films ... everything is very new-age.\"\nAbout her shift from films to TV, she said: \"TV is a very big medium for every actor. From Shah Rukh Khan to Amitabh Bachchan to Salman Khan everybody is on television. So why should the actresses lag behind?.\n\"It's been five years since I've been planning to do something on television. The way the Indian television is expanding and the kind of content we're showing, we're actually moving away from the typical Indian television. So for me it was very exciting.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:07:35.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
