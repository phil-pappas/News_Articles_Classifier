Photo: amazon.com \nSigned copies of Mein Kampf auctioned Seventy years after the author's death, new editions of Adolf Hitler's incendiary autobiographical manifesto,  Mein Kampf , are being prepared for publication as copyright restrictions are due to lapse.\nA centre for the study of Nazism, the government-funded Institute for Contemporary History in Munich, plans to publish the book in January with scholarly commentary, context and corrections to the text.\nIts reprint will be the first copies of Mein Kampf  published in Germany since 1934.    \nAdvertisement Now the Institute will be joined by Fayard, a French publishing company, which has announced it's going ahead with a critical, annotated translation after tossing up the rights and wrongs of the project since 2011.\n\"The publication of this book central to the history of the 20th century will be accompanied by a critical analysis established by a scientific committee of French and foreign historians,\" Fayard said in a statement issued at the Frankfurt Book Fair.\nNo date has been given for the new translation and the publisher has committed to announce the membership of the scientific committee. The decision effectively means that Mein Kampf will be available in two major European languages.  \nMein Kampf  means My Struggle in German. Dictated by Hitler to some of his fellow prisoners including Rudolph Hess after the failed Beer Hall putsch in Munich in 1923, the book came out in two volumes in 1925 and 1926.\nLaid down in Mein Kampf  are some of Hitler's most reviled ideas, including his plans for world conquest, his hatred of Jews and his adherence to a form of social Darwinism in that he claimed Germans were descendents of a superior Ayran race.\nIt was banned in Germany after Hitler and the Nazis were defeated in World War II. \nCopyright is held by the state of Bavaria, which has refused its republication in Germany. But 1934 copies of the French translation have been in constant circulation with the French press reporting a market research firm finding that at least 2,500 copies have been sold in 2015. Critical English translations are readily available on Amazon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T01:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:08:11.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
