It’s a film about a family, but from a new perspective,” Banerjee explained. \nOn being asked to elaborate on the tagline of the film, ‘Har family, family nahi hoti”, the debutant director, Kanu Behl said, “Families can be seen from various perspectives. There can be differences and discord in a family. Especially, Indian families are a bit peculiar in nature and dysfunctional as well. They lack the ability to communicate and resolve differences. Titli talks about that aspect of a family.” \nTitli was a personal tale for the director Kanu Behl who also co-wrote the film with Sharat Katariya. “The story of Titli stemmed out of the relationship I share with my father but it definitely is not cathartic” said the debutant director. When asked if it helped him resolve the issues with his dad, Lalit Behl who also plays Titli’s father in the film says, “It didn’t really resolve my issues with my dad but at the end of the film my relationship with him eased out for sure.” \nThe aspect of Titli that resonated with him the most, Dibakar said, was “In-between the course of violent events which happen in the film we get to see a beautiful relationship developing between Titli and his wife Neelu. They start to share an understanding that they both are stuck and need to break free. This development gives the story a surprising climax where lies the real fun for me.” \nDivulging on why a feminine name was given for a male protagonist, the director explained, “The film is about a coming of age story of this boy who wants to break away from his family, from the clutches of the father and violent brothers. Also, the mother wanted the third child to be daughter but they had a son, yet again. Hence, a feminine name seemed perfect.” \nTitli, which has been played at 30 festivals, won eight awards and released successfully in France and Germany, is a tale of a dysfunctional family and a young boy’s struggle to escape his oppressive family. The film is releasing on October 30. \nSynopsis: In the badlands of Delhi’s underbelly, Titli, the youngest member of a violent car-jacking brotherhood, plots a desperate bid to escape the ‘family’ business. His schemes are thwarted by his oppressive family, who marry him off against his will. But Titli finds an unlikely ally in his new wife, Neelu, who nurtures her own frustrated dreams. They form a strange, mutually exploitative pact to break the stranglehold of their family roots. But is escape the same as freedom?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T02:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T11:07:23.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
