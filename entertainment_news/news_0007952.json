Image 32 of 32 Rock band Garbage gets its own day in Houston 1 / 32 Back to Gallery Heads up, Houston. Tuesday is a citywide Garbage Day.\nBefore you start emptying the bins, it's not like that. Mayor Annise Parker has proclaimed the day in honor of alt-rock band Garbage, who performs Tuesday at Revention Music Center.\nRELATED: Garbage celebrates 20 years with tour\nThe group made a giddy announcement Sunday night on its Facebook page (\"Say WHAAAA ?!!?!). They were so excited, apparently, that they called the mayor \"Annie D Parker.\"\nHere's the text:\nWHEREAS, Garbage is an alternative rock band hailing from Madison, Wisconsin, and is comprised of Shirley Manson, Duke Erikson, Steve Marker and Butch Vig. They released their first album in 1995 and are now celebrating its 20th anniversary with the 20 Years Queer tour. Garbage has sold millions of records and won numerous awards; and,\nWHEREAS, in addition to their work as musicians, Garbage has championed many worthwhile causes, including gay rights and marriage equality, and has worked to benefit children's hospitals and children's cancer research, AIDS charities and research, PETA and the Pablove Foundation, among others; and,\nWHEREAS, on October 13, 2015, Garbage will have a concert at the Revention Music Center. The city of Houston congratulates Garbage for their accomplishments and on the 20th anniversary of their first album and extends best wishes for continued success.\nThe band's 20 Years Queer tour includes all the songs from its debut album, including \"Queer,\" \"Stupid Girl,\" \"Only Happy When it Rains\" and \"Vow.\"", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/56/8752033/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/05/8778071/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/56/8752032/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/35/42/15/7742310/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/75/8752974/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/75/8752982/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/56/8752034/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/01/8753221/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/75/8753013/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/74/8752900/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/73/8752837/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/75/8753007/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/00/8753210/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/56/8752032/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/56/8752034/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/00/8753179/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/75/8753013/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/72/8752829/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/00/8753178/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/05/8778071/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/77/8753146/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/00/8753214/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/35/42/15/7742310/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/01/8753219/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://bit.ly/1N0qolb", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/72/8752828/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/40/8763410/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/21/52/61/4631624/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/01/8753219/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/75/8753007/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/56/8752052/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/72/8752828/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/56/8752031/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/77/8753149/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/01/8753231/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/00/8753210/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/21/52/61/4631624/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/03/8753360/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/00/8753214/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/03/8753360/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/77/8753149/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/73/8752842/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/73/8752842/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/00/8753179/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/75/8752974/3/920x920.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/GarbageOfficial/photos/a.252533808090811.78027.243166889027503/1079636335380550/?type=3&theater", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/77/8753117/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/77/8753117/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/01/8753231/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/75/8752997/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/72/8752811/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/74/8752900/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/56/8752052/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/72/8752829/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/75/8752997/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/72/8752811/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/56/8752031/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/56/8752033/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/75/8752982/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/40/8763410/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/01/8753221/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/00/8753178/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/73/8752837/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/77/8753146/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T20:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:27:55.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
