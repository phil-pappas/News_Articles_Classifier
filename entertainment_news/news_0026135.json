After debuting with Sharwanand and Nithya Menen-starrer Malli Malli Idi Rani Roju earlier this year, the actress is now getting a slew of offers and all she is happy about is the fact that she broke the norms.\n\"People assume that once a girl is married, her career is over. But I am extremely happy that not only did I start my career after marriage but I am also receiving some very interesting offers,\" quips the actress while beaming with happiness about how some of the roles are that of a lead actress.\nFlooded with offers right now, the actress, however, is treading carefully. \"I am consciously being picky about the roles. Since I played a friend in my first film, everybody started offering similar roles and even though the roles are good, I don't want to be typecast,\" she insists, adding, \"I am in search of roles to showcase my versatility. That's why I accepted the role to play Mahesh Babu's sister in Brahmotsavam .\"\nWorking with Mahesh Babu could be an irresistible offer for many but Pavani's only motivation for the role was that the role required a lot more than the typical token hero's sister. \"Most of the times, the hero's sister is just there in the backdrop. But, in this film, I was offered a crucial role,\" shares Pavani, who also has another interesting film lined up which will see her alongside a well-known face in the industry.\nPavani, who will next be seen as Anushka's 'BFF' in Size Zero , says, \"Working with Anushka was a wonderful experience. I think her name Sweety perfectly suits her. She is someone who showers you with affection and love no matter who you are,\" she says. With so much work coming her way from T'town, one would think that quitting her nine to five job wouldn't be a tough decision, but Pavani is yet to consider resigning her job at a software firm. \"I am still testing waters in Tollywood,\" she says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T13:40:04.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
