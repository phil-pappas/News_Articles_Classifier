The Serbian produced a scintillating form this year as he clinched three Grand Slams namely Australian Open, Wimbledon and US Open. Reacting on his failure to complete a calendar year Grand Slam, the 28-year-old revealed that the French Open loss inspired him to make a comeback and perform well at Wimbledon and the US Open, Sport24 reported. Djokovic also affirmed that winning three out of four Grand Slams was not at all disappointing. Djokovic, who recently became a tennis great after claiming his 10th Grand slam at US Open, considered it to be his greatest achievement and said that he wants to keep performing like this. He stressed that he would work harder to reach the level of his Swiss counterpart Roger Federer, who has 17 grand slams as of now. Djokovic is scheduled to next play in the China Open. \n  3:31 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T01:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T01:38:56.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
