She’s worked alongside Craig in “Skyfall” as well. And when asked who she would pick if she could star opposite any actor, the 39-year-old actress told dailymail.co.uk: “Without a doubt I would chose Daniel Craig.” She added: “He is the ultimate Bond and I’ve loved working with him. For me, Bond wouldn’t be Bond without him, he’s revolutionised the whole thing. Honestly, I don’t think there’s been a better Bond”. Directed by Sam Mendes, “Spectre” marks Craig’s fourth appearance as the famous British spy. Apart from him, the film also stars Ralph Fiennes, Ben Whishaw, Rory Kinnear, Christoph Waltz and Monica Bellucci.
