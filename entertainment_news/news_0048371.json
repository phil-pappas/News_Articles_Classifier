(Dylan Martinez/Reuters) Like Neon Las Vegas on Facebook: By Dave Herrera Las Vegas Review-Journal \nThe list of nominees for induction in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame next year is out. Of the fifteen acts nominated, eight haven't been considered previously. Janet Jackson claims that distinction, along with iconic artists like Chicago, Cheap Trick, the Cars, Los Lobos, Chaka Khan, Steve Miller and the J.B.'s. Each of those acts will be vying for a spot in Cleveland with a number of other worthy acts such as N.W.A., whose profile has obviously been elevated this past year thanks to the eagerly anticipated and well-received release of \"Straight Outta Compton\" this past August, along with Dr. Dre's Apple Music colleague, Trent Reznor, whose band Nine Inch Nail is up for a nod again, in addition to the Smiths, the Spinners, Yes, Chic and Deep Purple. For consideration, each act had to have released an album 25 years ago or more. Fans can cast their votes through Wednesday, Dec. 9 at rockhall.com . The artists selected to be inducted into the Hall next year will be announced just before the holidays, followed by an induction ceremony to be held in New York City next spring. So far, it looks like Chicago is leading the poll, followed by Yes, the Cars, Deep Purple and Steve Miller rounding out the top five. Janet Jackson checks in at number six, trailed by Chaka Khan, Cheap Trick, the Spinners, N.W.A., Nine Inch Nails, Chic, The Smiths, Los Lobos and the J.B.'s.
