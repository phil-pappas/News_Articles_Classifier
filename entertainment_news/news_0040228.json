Jimmy Kimmel said on this stage that we'll see you back here next year Tracy Morgan. \n\"Well, thanks to my amazing doctors and the support of my family and my beautiful new wife, I'm here standing on my own two feet. It's been a long road back, I suffered a traumatic brain injury that put me in a coma for eight days.\" \nHe added: \"(When I woke up) I was just ecstatic to learn I wasn't the one who messed up.\" \nThe 46-year-old star was left fighting for his life last year after he was involved in a freak car accident in New Jersey, which tragically killed his friend James 'Jimmy Mack' McNair. \nDoctors were convinced Tracy would never be able to walk again unassisted and couldn't say for sure whether he'd make a full recovery considering the extent of his brain injury. car crash", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:37:38.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
