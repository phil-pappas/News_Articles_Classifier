His six-man band played well, and he did his darndest to engage the audience – telling stories behind the songs and off-hand remarks between them.\nAnd yet the hour-and-45-minute, 18-song (with two songs performed by his backing musicians) show sometimes seemed somehow flat, the room’s energy stilted.\nThe 71-year-old singer, dressed in a dapper dark suit ala a 1980s Robert Palmer, seemed to have his voice largely intact, with its familiar phrasing and tenor pitch, even if it was a bit thin early in the show on the hits “Restless Heart,” “One Good Woman” and “The Glory of Love” until it seemed to warm up.\nBy the time Cetera sang the 1976 Chicago chart-topper “If You Leave Me Now,” six songs into the show, he was even hitting the demanding falsetto notes, and getting a big hand from the crowd of perhaps 500.\nPeter Cetera at Valley Forge Casino Resort's Valley Forge Music Fair Peter Cetera at Valley Forge Casino Resort's Valley Forge Music Fair\nPeter Cetera at Valley Forge Casino Resort's Valley Forge Music Fair\nCetera seemed to want to connect with the crowd. Before “The Glory of Love,” he told how he wrote it for the movie “Rocky IV,” only to have it passed on, then picked for “The Karate Kid Part II.” When that got it nominated for a Best Song Academy Award, Cetera said he was “walking around lying for a year” that it was written for the latter.\nHe even commented on Chicago finally being nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame last week, after being eligible for more than 20 years.\n“Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, huh?” he said. “Where the hell you been for the past 30 years? Vendettas. Not going down without a fight, Rolling Stone.”\nPeter Cetera at Valley Forge Casino Resort's Valley Forge Music Fair Peter Cetera at Valley Forge Casino Resort's Valley Forge Music Fair\nPeter Cetera at Valley Forge Casino Resort's Valley Forge Music Fair\nThe show picked up momentum with Chicago’s heavier “Stay The Night,” then a very good version of the big Chicago hit “You’re the Inspiration,” on which Cetera kicked up the intensity at the right time – even loosening his tie. It got the biggest hand to that point.\n(It also was interesting that Cetera noted that Kenny Rodgers – whom ads before the show noted plays the same venue Dec. 18, passed on the song, which went to No.1. “Sorry, Kenny,” Cetera said.)\n And he followed that with his Adult Contemporary hit “Even a Fool Can See” – on which his voice was as bright as the band -- and \"The Next Time I Fall,\" his 1986 No. 1 hit with Amy Grant, with backup singer Jamelle Fraley adopting Grant’s style to sing her part.\nCetera even sang a snippet of his 1995 minor hit \"(I Wanna Take) Forever Tonight\" by request, though he said the band doesn’t play that song.\nIt was disappointing, then, that Cetera stopped that momentum by leaving the stage to change jackets while Fraley sang Linda Ronstadt’s “You’re No Good” and guitarist Chris Rodriguez did The Beatles’ “Come Together.”\nCetera returned for a surprisingly good 1988 deep cut “Save Me,” on which he and the band seemed to both finally really let loose. “Hard Habit to Break,” Cetera’s last No. 1 hit with Chicago before he left the band, would have been better without Rodriguez duetting on it.\nAfter Chicago’s minor hit \"Dialogue (Part I & II),\" Cetera closed the main set with his 1982 No. 1 hit with Chicago, “Hard to Say I’m Sorry.” He again hit the high notes, and extended the song with a two-minute snippet of “Get Away.”\nBut the concert really didn’t kick into high gear until the encore. Cetera opened it with a fairly rocking version of Spencer Davis Group’s “I’m a Man,” which Chicago covered on its first album 46 (!) years ago, playing bass as he did in that group.\nHe followed that with the night’s best: Chicago’s rocking 1973 hit “Feelin’ Stronger Every Day.” It was as if the room got a burst of energy; the crowd was on its feet and moving. And he closed with perhaps Chicago’s signature hit, “25 or 6 to 4,” on which the band’s energy also seemed to elevate.\nPerhaps it was that those Chicago songs are what really excites the audience. Perhaps it was that, at this point in his career, Cetera wants to finish strong. Maybe his solo hits don’t stand up as well. Or maybe it was just the crowd. Whatever the reason, that was the energy that was missing from most of the early part of the show.", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561bc1eb/turbine/mc-review-peter-cetera-at-valley-forge-casino--002", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561bc229/turbine/mc-review-peter-cetera-at-valley-forge-casino--003"], "published": "2015-10-12T18:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:52:48.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
