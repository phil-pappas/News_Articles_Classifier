Mark Latham admits to having trolling on Twitter Despite much hype, a controversial line-up of panelists and a charismatic host, Nine's new talk show  The Verdict has pulled only 9000 more viewers than an afternoon screening of The Bold and the Beautiful in its second outing.\nThis represents a significant drop in audience numbers from last week, when 522,000 people tuned in to the premiere.\nThe Verdict panel and host Karl Stefanovic. \nThe weekly program, modelled on a mixture of The Project and Q&A , promised fiery debate and a \"bumpy ride\" but in its second week was watched by fewer people than an episode of Grant Denyer's Family Feud .\nAdvertisement In the capital cities, 369,000 Australians tuned in to watch The Verdict, narrowly beating Ten's soap  The Bold and the Beautiful,  which snagged 360,000 viewers.\nThe abysmal result could spell the death knell for the show, which was reportedly given a five-episode run as the Nine Network trialled the new format. \nKarl Stefanovic on set of new show The Verdict. photo: supplied Photo: Supplied \nThe Verdict finished in 24th spot on Thursday night, trailing programs like Gogglebox , The Project , The Chaser's Media Circus and Highway Patrol .\nAs prime-time programs such as  The X Factor pull in more than one million viewers a night, the new Nine show is a certifiable flop.\nThe ratings will come as a huge blow to both Nine and its star Karl Stefanovic, with T he Verdict reportedly serving as the vehicle to launch the charming Today co-host into prime-time.\nMark Latham lashed out at \"attention seekers\" on The Verdict. Photo: The Verdict. \nHis star appeal, which helped turn around Today 's ratings, has failed to translate to the Q&A style program, and at many times Stefanovic has been swamped by the loud shouting of his panellists.\nDespite poor ratings, The Verdict  has generated many headlines thanks to its line-up of controversial personalities including former Labor leader Mark Latham.\nLast week, Mr Latham launched a crusade against mental illness, dismissing anxiety as simply \"worrying too much\" and accusing people of \"rorting the system\".\nStefanovic in an exchange with Julian Burnside on Thursday night's program.
