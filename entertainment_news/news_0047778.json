BBC Three announced this week that the seminal science fiction series is getting a spin-off aimed at young adults. Called Class, the eight-episode series will take place in modern-day London at Coal Hill School. If that sounds familiar, it's because it's where Clara Oswald ( Jenna Coleman ) currently teaches. \"Incredible dangers are breaking through the walls of time and space, and with darkness coming, London is unprotected,\" BBC Three ominously warned in a post announcing the series. \"This is Coal Hill School and Doctor Who like you've never seen them before.\" Here's what's coming to Netflix -- and leaving it -- in October The network says the show will have all the \"action, heart and adrenaline\" of beloved young adult fiction like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and The Hunger Games . YA author Patrick Ness, who wrote The Knife of Never Letting Go and A Monster Calls , will write the series. \"I'm astounded and thrilled to be entering the Doctor Who universe,\" he told the BBC. \"I can't wait for people to meet the heroes of Class, to meet the all-new villains and aliens, to remember that the horrors of the darkest corners of existence are just about on par with having to pass your A-Levels.\" The series will begin filming in Wales early next year. Doctor Who has had a few different spin-offs before, most notably Torchwood, The Sarah Jane Adventures and K-9 . Ooh, let's hope Ness writes in a new K-9 for the series. Perhaps as a hall monitor? What do you think of a YA Doctor Who spin-off?
