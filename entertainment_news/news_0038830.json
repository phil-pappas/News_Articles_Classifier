Vin Diesel's \"The Last Witch Hunter\" also tanked with $10.8 million.

After two very strong limited-release weekends, the biopic failed to impress in wide release with $7.3 million. \nThe weekend of duds left room for holdovers to take the top spots. In second place, \"Goosebumps\" earned $15.5 million, while \"The Martian\" reclaimed its throne in weekend four with $15.9 million.
