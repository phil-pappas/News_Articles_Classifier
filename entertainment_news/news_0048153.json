Special to Newsday \nadvertisement | advertise on newsday \nSinger-songwriter Taylor Swift has donated $50,000 to a cancer fund for the nephew of one of her backup dancers. \n\"Baby Ayden, I'm lucky enough to perform with your uncle Toshi on tour,\" the \"Bad Blood\" singer, 25, posted on the GoFundMe page for 13-month-old Ayden, whose uncle Kim \"Toshi\" Davidson, 28, performs on Swift's \"1989\" tour. \"All of us are praying for you and your mama and sending so much love your way. Love, Taylor.\" \nadvertisement | advertise on newsday \n\"So I get off the plane in Toronto and this is the 1st thing I see,\" Davidson wrote Wednesday on Instagram, captioning a screengrab of Swift's GoFundMe message. \"Taylor Swift is an angel and My family and I can't thank her enough. She is such an incredible human being. This will help Lil Toshi in this time of need,\" he said, referring to his nephew's nickname. \"Let's pray for him to beat this. This unexpected gift is truly a blessing.\" \nAccording to the page gofundme.com/ilovebabyayden, the child was in an ICU for two weeks with apparent pneumonia. Surgery, however, found cancer cells in fluid extracted from his lungs. Tests are being done to determine the type of cancer, and in the meantime his mother, Lindsey Licari, \"was let go from her job since she had to be by his side at the hospital for the past few weeks,\" the page said. \n\"Taylor you have taken an enormous weight off my shoulders by allowing me to walk this journey with my son and be his protector,\" Licari wrote on the page. In April, Swift disclosed that her mother, with whom she is very close, has been diagnosed with cancer.

Goldwyn estate in Beverly Hills, California, for $25 million, property records showed that title to the estate has gone to a Nashville, Tennessee, company at Swift's address. \nComing soon: Newsday's Entertainment newsletter, for the latest on celebs, TV, more.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:22:47.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
