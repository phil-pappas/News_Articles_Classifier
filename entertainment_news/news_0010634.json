Visit http://makelivesbetter.uthscsa.edu/bookauthor or call 210-567-1206.\nBy Jan Jarboe Russell\nScribner, $30\nFive years of intensive research and writing led to one of 2015’s best books, San Antonio writer Jan Jarboe Russell’s “The Train to Crystal City.” The Beaumont native, a former Express-News columnist and contributing editor at Texas Monthly, tells the story of a secret WWII internment camp in South Texas where, from 1942 to 1948, thousands of German, Japanese and Italian immigrants — many born in the United States — lived behind barbed wire. A critically acclaimed New York Times best-seller, this heart-wrenching history book reads like a rich, many-layered novel. Jarboe is a graduate of the University of Texas at Austin who went on to become a Nieman Fellow in journalism at Harvard College. Among her many articles for Texas Monthly is “No Retreat! No Surrender,” published in 2010, a controversial story about how the Daughters of The Republic of Texas. Of her 1999 book “Lady Bird: A Biography,” the Washington Quote: : “Jan Jarboe Russell treats Lady Bird Johnson as a substantial figure in her own right rather than merely an appendage to her husband, the president.”\n“Little Victories: Perfect Rules for Imperfect Living”\nBy Jason Gay\nDoubleday, $25\nAs a sports columnist for The Wall Street Journal, Jason Gay this year has written about Ronda Rousey, Deflategate, Caitlyn Jenner and the San Antonio Spurs. That column begins: “One of these days, we should all become San Antonio Spurs. I know it’s not as simple as that, but it should be. Come on. Let’s get the Spurs to make us Spurs for one day. One hour. Twenty minutes. Ninety seconds. If the Spurs would have me, I am ready to put on the black and silver.” Gay lives in Brooklyn, where he says he plays adequate tennis, dreadful basketball, hideous golf and races a bicycle very, very slowly. His most popular pieces are his Rules columns, which provide untraditional advice for navigating everyday life. Gay’s new book is “Little Victories: Perfect Rules for Imperfect Living,” which he describes as NOT a guide for mastering your money or changing your diet. Rather, Gay offers common-sense advice — hilariously and brilliantly — on such issues as living with small children and surviving Thanksgiving with the in-laws. Gay calls his advice “both practical and ridiculous … neither perfect nor universal.”\n“Enchiladas: Aztec to Tex-Mex”\nBy Cappy Lawton and Chris Waters Dunn\nTrinity University Press, $39.95\nThe enchilada is more than an everyday Mexican menu staple. Just ask San Antonio restaurateur Cappy Lawton, who with Chris Waters Dunn has written the sumptuous new cookbook and taste-bud guide “Enchiladas: Aztec to Tex-Mex.” Lawton, of Cappy’s and La Fonda on Main fame, will tell you the enchilada is the history of a people that embodies thousands of years of Mexican life. Lavishly illustrated with mouth-watering photography, the book is a showcase for more than 60 traditional and contemporary recipes for enchiladas, and also includes recipes for the salsas, salads and sides that often accompany them. After studying engineering at the University of Texas at Austin and having a successful career as an aeronautical designer, Lawton developed and operated 29 restaurants throughout Texas. Dunn is a San Antonio native who holds a graduate degree in creative writing from the University of Denver. He worked for decades in Nashville as a songwriter and record producer, retiring from the music business to pursue a second career in culinary studies. He graduated with honors from the Culinary Institute of America.\n“In the Country: Stories”\nBy Mia Alvar\nKnopf Doubleday, $26.95\nManila-born, New York-based Mia Alvar is a writer with “enchanting powers” whose “finely wrought shocks, delivered in exacting prose, reverberate without easy resolution,” according to the New York Times. In nine globe-trotting, unforgettable tales, this remarkable new literary talent vividly gives voice to the women and men of the Filipino diaspora. She explores the lives of exiles, emigrants and wanderers who uproot their families from the Philippines to begin new lives in the Middle East, the United States and elsewhere. A pharmacist living in New York smuggles drugs to his ailing father in Manila, only to discover alarming truths about his family and his past. In Bahrain, a Filipina teacher drawn to a special pupil finds, to her surprise, that she is questioning her own marriage. And in the title story, a journalist and a nurse face an unspeakable trauma amidst the political turmoil of the Philippines in the 1970s and ’80s. Alvar’s debut collection was was a Summer 2015 Barnes & Noble Discover Great New Writers Selection, a New York Times Book Review Editors’ Choice and a San Francisco Chronicle Recommended Book.\n“San Antonio: Our Story of 150 Years in the Alamo City”\nBy the staff of the San Antonio Express-News\nTrinity University Press, $39.95\nIn 2015, the Express-News chronicled the city’s history on the occasion of the newspaper’s 150th birthday in daily articles for more than nine months. The book gathers 250 stories — on themes ranging from education to sports to culture — in a lavishly illustrated coffee-table book.\nThe latest book from longtime luncheon “miztress” of ceremonies Coleen Grissom, “The World According to Coleen” (Trinity University Press, $17.95) also will be available.\nsbennett@express-news.net", "external_links": ["http://makelivesbetter.uthscsa.edu/bookauthor"], "published": "2015-10-10T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:38:46.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
