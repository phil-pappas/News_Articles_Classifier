(UPI) -- Maybe he was a trans-fur student.\nA student at a Montana high school captured footage of a black bear taking an early morning stroll through a school hallway before the start of classes.\nKevin Conwell, principal of Bozeman High School, said the bear was first spotted on the football field about 7:30 a.m. Wednesday and the animal soon found its way into the building through an open garage door in the custodial area.\nConwell said students snapped photos and captured video of the bear, but they remained at a safe distance from the animal at all times.\n\"They were being careful. They were keeping a good, safe distance,\" Conwell told the Bozeman Daily Chronicle.\nThe bear eventually left through an open exit and police helped guide it back to a more hospitable area.\nCopyright 2015 by United Press International Share Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1738444&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1738444", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1738444&h=VIDEO%3A+Black+bear+takes+early+morning+stroll+through+high+school"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:12:17.517+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
