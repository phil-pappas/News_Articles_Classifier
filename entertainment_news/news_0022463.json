By Luke Karmali When I think of the Battlefront of my youth, the memories that linger longest are of epic battles taking place across the surface of vast planets between two opposing factions. That to me is the essence of what Battlefront is. So the fact DICE has decided to try and distil such epic gameplay down into a smaller experience that’s still recognisable as Battlefront is remarkably brave. What’s even more surprising is that it appears to have succeeded. Over the course of the few hours I had exploring the Drop Zone mode, I became increasingly enamoured with it. In case you missed out on the initial announcement , Drop Zone places you in an 8v8 match where your task is to capture pods that fall from the sky and then defend them from the opposing forces for a minute. Once that happens, you’re faced with a choice – do you continue to guard the pod while it opens, gaining access to the power-ups nestled at its core, or do you waste no time in heading towards the next drop in case your enemy gets there first and digs in? Got feedback on our player? We want to hear it. The more I played of Drop Zone, the more it came to be my favourite bit of Battlefront so far – with Walker Assault’s massive 40-man shootouts it’s too easy to feel your individual contribution is negligible. In Drop Zone, every single thing you do matters – if you manage to get a well-placed Thermal Detonator off towards an enemy-held pod you can wipe out half their team in an instant, opening it up for your squad to swoop in and claim it. “ \nFast-paced gameplay that feels different from something epic and grand as Walker Assault, for example. “What we wanted to do was have a fun action-packed mode where you have these drop pods coming down and they create quite a lot of chaos,” explains senior producer Sigurlina Ingvarsdottir. “As soon as they come down you’re fighting for them, then you have to make the decision whether you want to stay and guard the pod you’ve claimed or go off to get the next pod. So that was kind of what we were after – that fast-paced gameplay that feels different from something epic and grand as Walker Assault, for example.” It also helps that Sullust itself is incredibly visually striking. Until now we’ve only glimpsed its lava streams and sulphur pools from above in Fighter Squadron mode; getting to actually fight down in the dirt is an entirely different experience. The artists at DICE collaborated with LucasFilm to decide how to realise Sullust, a planet we’ve heard about before but never properly explored, and the results are impressive. They’ve successfully captured a sense of the heat and dirt you’d expect in such a hostile environment, and it palpably adds to the tension of matches. \n“Sullust is known from the lore of Star Wars as this place where the Empire manufactures these machines of war, so that’s also interesting in terms of feeling super-hostile,” explains Ingvarsdottir. “You’ve seen Endor, Hoth and Tatooine before – you know these planets - but Sullust is taking a planet that people haven’t really seen to that extent before and then working with LucasFilm to come up with what it looks like then bringing that visualisation into Star Wars going forward, so other media that will explore Sullust will use our take as the reference. Got feedback on our player? We want to hear it. “That collaboration was for our artists incredibly engaging and interesting, working with people like Doug Chiang who is lead concept artist for the series. He was production designer on the prequels and a close collaborator with George Lucas, he’s been leading us in this process. We adapt pieces of known architecture, like the AT-AT stations or bunkers seen on Endor, to a new planet to replicate that feeling of ‘Star Wars-ness’ in a location that feels more strange. “ \nSullust is known from the lore of Star Wars as this place where the Empire manufactures these machines of war, so that’s also interesting in terms of feeling super-hostile. “For me personally, what became interesting, was the artists told me they were going to go to Iceland to capture references and photogrammetry data so for me it’s weird, it’s this super alien planet but it also feels like home for me! Especially the Drop Zone map, it actually looks like places I’ve been to.” \nIn terms of the Drop Zone map set in the fiery wasteland, rocky outcrops and stacked supply crates provide cover from which you can shoot at enemy forces, while the smouldering remains of both X-Wings and TIE Fighters dot the battlefield; along with the red veins of lava that run through the land, these help keep the arena looking exciting and dynamic, rather than just the same brown landscape copy-pasted over and over. Steep mountainous terrain pens you in at one end of the map, while the other is marked by a vast, impassable lake. The main set piece, however, is a huge Imperial Shuttle, parked for maintenance and surrounded by mechanical equipment. Navigating this maze to try and get closer to crashed pods while TIEs scream above is an incredibly atmospheric affair. We didn’t get the chance to explore Drop Zone maps on other planets, though if they’re as well designed as Sullust’s then there’s little to fear. Mounds of boulders add verticality to proceedings, meaning if you’re feeling brave you can set up shop to try and protect a dropped pod from on-high with the Sniper Rifle power-up. A word of caution though – the map’s design means while you may be able to aid in defending a pod for a while in this way, the fact you’re up on an outcrop means you’re a sitting Womp Rat if anyone decides to come up behind you, or if you start to indulge in a spot of camping.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:24:35.760+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
