Martin Lawrence sort-of made the announcement about a year ago on Conan, but the story went quiet until it cropped up again when it was intimated that Joe Carnahan was working on not one, but two sequels to the Bad Boy series.\nSo, thoughts?

Evidently, Smith is eager to get back in the game and has begun to plunder his back catalogue.\nAfter the so-so Men In Black 3, he's obviously looking at trying out a few of his older films to get them going. As we know, he passed on Independence Day 2 - which is a crying shame, in fairness - but he's obviously got plans to reinvigorate Bad Boys for a new generation.\nThe question is, though, will there be a camera circling him when he takes phone calls?\nVia YouTube\nMORE: Sh*t just got real - there's two Bad Boys sequels on the way\nMORE: Daniel Craig says he's NOT done with James Bond just yet\nMORE: Robert DeNiro reteaming with Joe Pesci, Al Pacino & Martin Scorsese for I Heard You Paint Houses", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/CT4zlcKgOm8", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CT4zlcKgOm8"], "published": "2015-10-07T18:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:37:12.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
