The big movies opening this weekend are “Steve Jobs,” an R biopic about Jobs starring Michael Fassbender; “Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension,” an R entry in this horror franchise; “The Last Witch Hunter,” a PG-13 action movie starring Vin Diesel; and “Rock the Kasbah,” an R comedy starring Bill Murray. 2. Sunday is the beginning of International Magic Week, a time to celebrate magic and magicians. The special week was created to end on Oct. 31, which is Halloween, of course, but also the day that Harry Houdini died. 3. Sunday also is World Pasta Day, a holiday designed to celebrate pasta in all its delicious forms. Take part in the special day by making a special pasta dish at home, or by going to a restaurant for some good eats. And remember, pasta doesn’t just mean an Italian meal - you’ll find it in Asian dishes and others as well. 4. Halloween is next weekend, making this the prime time to get to a haunted house. Check the newspaper for listings, or seek out some other spooky seasonal fun. 5. And again we have lots of good sports on tap: the MLB playoffs, NASCAR’s Chase, NFL and college football, MLS soccer and more. Check your TV guide for more information.
