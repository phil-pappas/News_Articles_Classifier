PETERSBURG, FLA. \nA Pinellas County circuit judge has ruled that several pieces of evidence related to the Hulk Hogan sex-tape case will remain confidential despite a request from a group of media outlets that they be made public. \nOf the 17 items discussed Thursday during a hearing, Judge Pamela Campbell determined that 15 will remain sealed, one will be unsealed and one pushed to a later discussion. \nHogan, a former WWE wrestler whose real name is Terry Bollea, is suing the news website Gawker. \nHogan claims that the media company’s decision to publish an excerpt from a sex tape violated his privacy. The video involves Hogan and Heather Cole, the ex-wife of radio shock jock Bubba the Love Sponge Clem. \nHogan is demanding $100 million in damages. \nOldman, wife divorce \nLOS ANGELES \nA judge has finalized Oscar-nominated actor Gary Oldman’s divorce from his fourth wife after six years of marriage. \nLos Angeles Superior Court Judge Maren Nelson finalized the couple’s divorce Tuesday, and the paperwork was publicly released Thursday. \nThe actor has agreed to pay singer Alexandra Edenborough $3.3 million, and their judgment divides up numerous assets, with Oldman keeping two homes and several vehicles. \nAssociated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:36:21.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
