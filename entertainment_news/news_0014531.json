The aim of the rally is to strengthen Hindu power as Hinduism can only bring global peace,” said Nipendra Chandray Roy, a senior leader of the RSS. \nThe rally started from the Jagannath temple here and went through the streets of Agartala and concluded at the same spot. Hundreds of RSS workers from all ages including young boys of both tribal and non-tribal communities were seen in their traditional khaki half pant and white shirt with baton parading in the rhythm of the drums. \nUtpal Biswas, a participant in the parade said, “At present the activities of the Sangh is increasing here and the new generation is also attracted towards it as in today’s society there is absence of cultural education and only Sangha preaches this.” \nMany young children were seen participating in the parade who expressed that they had voluntarily joined the RSS to get lessons on nationalism, cultural, philosophical, moral, intellectual, spiritual and ideological beliefs. \n“I have joined here because they teach about patriotism towards our motherland and the society. Today is Mahalaya, an auspicious day, and the rally is to show our love towards our country and inspire others,” said Subrata Chakraborty, a young participant. \nThe rally has shown the growing popularity of the RSS in the lone Left ruled Indian state where only a day back the general secretary of the Communist Party of India Marxist (CPI(M)) Sitaram Yechury in his speech alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is a political arm of RSS and it is trying to unite Hindus in the country on the basis of hatred against religious minorities. \n  6:03 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:52:54.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
