Democratic lawmakers on the panel occasionally lashed out at their Republican colleagues in her defence.\n\"If we stay here much longer, you're going to have to take that 03:00 phone call from the committee room,\" said Democratic panel member Adam Schiff. The reference was to a famous Clinton ad during the 2008 presidential campaign suggesting that she would be best prepared to handle national emergencies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T17:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:28:17.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
