Mohanan More people know now that there lived a man named Moideen, with the movie on his love story making a lot of news. Long long before Ennu Ninte Moideen, a short story was penned, with focus on the man more than his love story. The story Moideen written by N. Mohanan, who knew the fellow for many years, was a profile-like tale of his life.\nBack then, Doordarshan screened a telefilm out of it, and Asha Sharath had played the love interest to Moideen, portrayed by Mahesh Panju. Though there was no social media then to share and connect with the people, Mohanan’s story earned laurels from the people of Kozhikode who knew Moideen.\nSixteen years ago, on an October, Mohanan passed away, leaving behind his many short stories for literature lovers. A commemoration meeting organised by Sammohanam, an association of his friends and well-wishers, will be held on October 3. Moideen’s story will be read out there.\n“I remember him visiting our house many times when I was a girl. He was a very lively person involved in many cultural organisations and sports,” Mohanan’s daughter Sarita Varma says.\n“Dad wrote that he was a harbinger of luck, because every time he came, something good happens at our house,” she remembers. Writer Gracy will talk about Mohanan at a function to be held at Press Club, Thiruvananthapuram. There will also be a seminar on contemporary short story writing led by Dr K.S. Ravi Kumar, Dr K.K. Hiranyan and Ashokan Charuvil.\n entertainment Mollywood Moideen N.
