Green hills and only one lane in each direction. It’s one of the opening images in a new exhibit at the museum, “The Canyon Project: Artivism,” documenting the 30-year activist art project by Chamberlain and his late business partner Jerry Burchfield.\nThough it’s been widened, the road still has that remote and secluded feeling, especially compared to modern Irvine to its north. But it has changed, the result of compromises between advocates for development and those for preservation. \nChamberlain came to Orange County planning to do something with photography, a skill he’d picked up in the Army. He met Burchfield and the two began their photo lab business, now BC Space Gallery. \nThis was the 1970s, and development looked to be coming to Laguna Beach, Chamberlain said as he walked through the exhibit last week with Mike McGee, curator for the show and director of the Begovich Gallery at Cal State Fullerton. \n“The community was already fearful of what was coming. Nobody knew exactly what was coming, but they knew that big changes were heading our way,” Chamberlain said. Laguna Canyon Road emerged as a focal point.\nBurchfield died in 2009; he had colon cancer. \nOver the 30 years of their art project, they lost some battles and won others.\nChamberlain described their early efforts as guerrilla warfare. The project’s first few phases consisted of documenting the road, to fix it in time before it was altered. They began in 1980 by photographing all nine miles of the road in daylight, taking photos every 76.5 feet like surveyors. For another phase, they took photos of all nine miles at night. Most of the frames were black, but that was the point – it was the opposite of a lit-up city street.\nThey printed those night shots and made long strips that they laid along the canyon road, held in place by flashing warning lights. It looked like a landing strip for E.T., Chamberlain said. People called police reporting that there was a major accident. \n“That’s when we were really lucky that we didn’t get arrested,” he said with a grin. “We must’ve been very young and dumb, but we had the bit in our teeth and were running with it.” \nART PLUS ACTIVISM They had a term for what they were doing. “A lot of people questioned (whether) what we were doing was art or activism,” Chamberlain said. “So we just said hell, it’s ‘artivism.’ Why should they not merge?”\nTo display these long coils of photos, Burchfield and Chamberlain made “The Time Machine for Moving Stills.” The conveyor-belt like apparatus went to many museums, including the Bowers Museum and the Photographic Resource Center in Boston. More invitations came from other museums, but the partners decided to stop there. There was more work to be done. \nWhat was needed now was public involvement. \n“The Tell,” installed along the canyon road in 1989, is probably the best-known part of their project. With private donations and grants from the city and groups such as the Laguna Canyon Conservancy, they built a 636-foot long mural along Laguna Canyon Road. It was plastered with photos they had solicited – from people who lived near, who had visited or had family in Laguna Beach or just were interested in the canyon road’s preservation. It stood for about nine months.\nNot much is left. A big portion, by then in storage, was destroyed in the 1993 Laguna Beach fire. But several sections are on display in the exhibit, the photos of familes, friends, cars, moments faded to a monochromatic yellow and weathered by the elements.\nPeople came to see themselves in the mural, seeking out their photos while standing at the foot of the huge structure. By the time of “The Tell,” Chamberlain and Burchfield and others advocating to preserve Laguna Beach’s wilderness had gotten enough attention that people were asking how they could help. “This project gave everybody something to do,” Chamberlain said.\nWIN SOME, LOSE SOME On Veteran’s Day in 1989, thousands walked along Laguna Canyon Road to protest a toll road into Laguna Canyon and a 3,200-unit housing development proposed by the Irvine Co., to be called Laguna Laurels. The toll road did eventually happen, but the proposed development didn’t – Laguna Beach residents voted to tax themselves in part for the city’s $78 million purchase of about 2,150 acres from the Irvine Co. to halt development. Today, that’s the Laguna Coast Wilderness Park.\nChamberlain and Burchfield acknowledged that everything they set out to do wasn’t going to be accomplished, said McGee, the curator. That’s the point of a 1994 piece in the exhibit, “The Witness Box,” documenting Burchfield and Chamberlain laying in graves they dug for themselves after their final legal defense against the toll road failed. \n“The bottom line is that it got so many people involved,” McGee said of why “The Canyon Project” was effective. “That was the secret. ... One of the things that made this project exceptional is that it got so many people involved and touched so many people’s lives.”\nWas Chamberlain surprised he and Burchfield had an effect at all?\n“Well, hope springeth eternal,” he said, smiling. “We were surprised, but at the same time we weren’t, because we were right.”\nContact the writer: aboessenkool@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:13:49.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
