There, his 2012 declaration in a \"Meet the Press\" interview that he supported same-sex marriage was praised as an example of political courage. At the time, however, it was added to the catalog of supposed Biden gaffes, in part because President Barack Obama had yet to say the same.\n\"This man is not afraid to speak his mind, and he has never shied away from speaking up for us,\" HRC President Chad Griffin said in his introduction.\nBiden has welcomed the support of LGBT community, casting his 2012 comments as part of a longer-term fight in his career for justice that goes back to his campaign against Robert Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court.\nBut Saturday night Biden said more credit for the nation's growing embrace of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender equality goes to the grass-roots activists.\n\"Some of you credited me with taking a political risk and thought I was doing something special. But folks, I was just answering in a straightforward, direct way what I've known my whole life,\" he said. \"The very fact that we finally recognize that love is not a political matter, it's a basic human right ... is because of all of you.\"\nBiden made no mention of the 2016 presidential contest in his remarks, though some in the audience shouted encouragement for him to join the Democratic field.\nBut the vice president did with characteristic candor take on some of the Republicans he said would reverse continued progress.\n\"There are still those shrill voices in the national political arena trying to undo what has finally been done. But they're not going to succeed,\" he said. \"The American people are with you.\nEight years ago, such talk might have added to questions about Biden's candidacy. Consider a question Biden faced as a candidate in a 2007 primary debate, when NBC's Brian Williams cited a Los Angeles Times editorial calling Biden a \"gaffe machine\" prone to \"uncontrolled verbosity.\"\n\"Can you reassure voters in this country that you would have the discipline that you would need on the world stage?\" Williams asked.\nBiden answered as succinctly as he could: \"Yes,\" to laughter and applause.\nBiden is expected to sit out of the first Democratic primary debate on Oct. 13. But he'll remain with events like one scheduled Thursday, in which he will follow Sen. Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass., in delivering a keynote address at a infrastructure conference.\nThe first candidate filing deadlines are only weeks away, including for New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary on Nov. 20.\nHillary Rodham Clinton also has a committed following in the LGBT community, as was evident in the program before Biden spoke. Each time the former secretary of state appeared on screen the audience erupted in applause.\nClinton made a direct appeal to the same organization earlier Saturday at a breakfast reception. She endorsed the Federal Equality Act, a revised version of the Employee Non Discrimination Act that seeks to expand protections for gay and transgender individuals to include housing, health care, public education and jury selection. She also called for allowing transgender individuals to serve in the military.\n\"I know you've had your share of politicians speaking out, courting your support at election time and then disappearing -- as if your lives and your rights are just a political bargaining chip,\" she said. \"Well, those who know me know that's not me. I've been fighting alongside you and others for equal rights -- and I'm just getting warmed up.\"\n(c)2015 Tribune Co.\nVisit Tribune Co. at www.latimes.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/politics/politicalnews/s-1732605", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/politics/politicalnews/s-1732605&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/politics/politicalnews/s-1732605&h=Biden%27s+2012+gay%2Dmarriage+%27gaffe%27+now+looks+like+an+asset"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:24:22.301+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
