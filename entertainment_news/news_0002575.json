I am really not. Coming into Bollywood, I think definitely it has made me stronger and more responsible.\n\n\"I do feel proud of my gender, of being a woman. I do speak against gender inequality. I am the brand ambassador for Haryana's 'Beti Bachao Beti Padao' campaign. And I think it is very important for me personally to strive for equality, especially the industry that I come from,\" said the actress, who was in the city today.\n\nThe \"Ishaqzaade\" star feels her entry in Bollywood has reaffirmed her belief in gender equality and that there is a need in the society to fill gaps of inequality among men and women.\n\n\"Now, I understand and accept that anything that I do, could and I hope should inspire young girls. Now, I am very particular about what I say or do. If that makes me half a feminist, then that's okay. I want girls to be treated the way men are. Somewhere we lack that in our country. So, I do want to be a role model but not a feminist,\" she added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T14:46:33.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
