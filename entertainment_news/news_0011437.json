I saw the original Off-Broadway smash hit – at the Orpheum Theater on 2 nd Avenue in the East Village, a long, long time ago. A fun score with hilarious lyrics by famous collaborators Alan Menkin and Howard Ashman, that doesn’t involve complicated orchestrations and a small cast make this show a favorite for community and regional theater. check out the trailer Central New York Playhouse tackles this high energy, frothy, spoof with its usual spirited zaniness and gung-ho attitude. Skid Row flower shop owned by Mr. Mushnik (Jim Magnerilli) has two other employees, nebbish amateur botanist, Seymour (Justin Polly) and naïve blonde bombshell Audrey (Korrie Taylor), who despite her dimness has a heart of gold. The flower shop, like everything else on Skid Row has seen better days and Mushnik is close to shutting his doors for good. Then an unusual plant that Seymour grew from a graft and a seedling starts to gather a tremendous amount of attention. This thrusts Seymour and the flower shop into the celebrity spotlight. Fame always comes with a price and here the Faust legend meets a B movie horror film doo wop when Seymour becomes a puppet of Audrey II, named for Seymour’s unrequited love. The ever growing, ever controlling plant that wants only one thing for its daily menu, increases its demands and things get complicated when Audrey’s sadistic, abusive boyfriend, who naturally chose dentistry for a profession comes into the shop. Oren, the dentist is riotously played by Jordan Westfall, who also cannily plays minor characters in the ensemble. It is one of those performances that magically straddles the top, without ever going over the top. Theater is all about presence and Westfall is so hysterically menacing as Oren that he appears much taller on stage. However, the entire cast is great: Polly’s Seymour is spot on as the ever optimistic innocent who struggles to do the right thing. Energetic and effusive Polly is a joy to watch. Taylor’s Audrey is deliciously entertaining. Her characterization is perfect, and her singing voice is strong and always true to character. She is part dim bombshell, part cheerleader and part wise martyr. Jim Magnerilli’s Mr. Mushnik’s father figure, who isn’t immune to a darker side when desperate, is totally credible. Here is another characterization that is enhanced by great singing. Kudos to the entire cast, including the zippy ensemble and to perfect voiced Audrey II by J Brazil. As always the energy, effort and heart put into this CNY Playhouse production cannot be beat. This is a totally enjoyable and sharply directed show. My only quibble, and it is a quibble, is that sometimes the music over powered the vocals, and occasionally, lyrics were hard to discern. However, this didn’t happen often and it seems to be a result of the venue and not the orchestrations. CNY Playhouse has a crowd-funding campaign going on and I appeal to all those who love and appreciate theater in the community to support them. This support will help solve these logistic problems and enable them to continue producing great shows.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T20:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:23:16.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
