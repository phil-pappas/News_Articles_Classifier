The painting, from the William I. Koch collection, will be auctioned Nov. 5, 2015. (Sotheby's via AP)   NEW YORK â€” \nAn erotic painting of a cabaret singer by Pablo Picasso with a second picture on the reverse side could bring over $60 million at auction. \nPicasso's \"The Night Club Singer\" from his Blue Period was created in 1901. \nA bawdy picture of his dealer, Pere Manach, is on the back. Sotheby's says it was revealed during a 2000 conservation. An inscription indicates it was intended as a gift to Manach. \nThe seller is billionaire businessman William Koch (kohk), who displayed it so it could be seen from both sides. \nHe's also selling a 1908 \"Water Lilies\" painting by Claude Monet. It's estimated at $30 million to $50 million. \nThe sale is Nov. 5. \nKoch is a 1992 America's Cup winner and brother of conservative donors Charles and David Koch. \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to show the correct title of the work is \"Water Lilies,\" not \"Water Lily.\" Copyright  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:01:18.354+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
