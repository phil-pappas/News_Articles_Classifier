BY MATTHEW SIGUR | Comments \nBaton Rouge realtor and musician James Fogle grew up, hanging out in the old Bebop Music Shop, which was formerly located on Government Street. \nAfter Bebop closed, Fogle was one of the many musicians in town who missed a local music equipment shop they could call their own. \nThis weekend, those musicians will have a new music gear and equipment shop. \nBaton Rouge Music Exchange , co-owned by Fogle and Ryan Clark, celebrates its grand opening Saturday, Oct. 24. The store is located at 4262 Perkins Road, behind Black Torch Tattoo, and will open at 11:30 a.m. \nRegular hours are Tuesday-Saturday 11:30 a.m.-6 p.m. Appointments can be made by calling (225) 478-3869. \nThe shop offers musical gear, such as guitars, basses and drum sets, on consignment. Baton Rouge Music Exchange will also have an eBay, Amazon and Reverb store to connect buyers and sellers. \n“The time was right,” Fogle said. “There are only a couple music stores in town. We needed one of the LSU/downtown side of the city, for sure. The consignment aspect is a big part of our business.” \nWith the shop, Fogle said customers can meet buyers and try out gear, rather than meet up at an awkward location. \nThrough a partnership with Riverfront Music, the store will also offer guitar repair and restoration and amp modifications. \nIn the future, Fogle said Baton Rouge Music Exchange will also have music lessons and small art and music shows. Already, Fogle is encouraging local bands and artists to sell their merchandise, with no fee attached. \n“Our vision is to have a living room atmosphere where musicians can come and hang out and feel comfortable,” he said. “It’s their shop.” Get The Advocate in your inbox", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T05:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:52:24.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
