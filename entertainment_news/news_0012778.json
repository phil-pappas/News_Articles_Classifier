The \" Steve Jobs \" producer, Scott Rudin, has signed up to develop the upcoming movie. Rudin is now making updates to the script and approaching directors. With the new producer, the movie is expected to start filming in 2016. Niija Kuykendall, Nik Mavinkurve and Jon Berg are overseeing for Warner Bros.. Guillermo del Toro, who both scripted and was set to helm, passed on the directorial job this summer and decided to helm \" Pacific Rim 2 \". However, del Toro is still involved as producer in \"Dark Universe\". \"Dark Universe\" is based on the comic series \"Justice League Dark\", which was written by Peter Milligan and illustrated by Mikel Janin. The comic books were first published in November 2011. Plot details are kept under wraps, but the movie is said to feature a series of ancient tomes stolen by a madman trying to destroy humanity. Detective John Constantine then looks for a group of heroes that specialize in the mystic and arcane to help him save the world. There is no word yet on which superheroes will appear in the upcoming movie, but del Toro had previously mentioned that Swamp Thing, Deadman, Zatanna and Etrigan The Demon would make up the team. Rudin recently wrapped filming on Ben Stiller 's comedy \" Zoolander 2 \". He will next develop \" The Legacy of a Whitetail Deer Hunter \", starring Josh Brolin and Danny McBride . \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Dark Universe News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T12:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:34:59.473+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
