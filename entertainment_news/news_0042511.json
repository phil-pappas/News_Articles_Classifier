He was 73 years old. \nHis agent, Brent Taylor, said the singer died at his home Tuesday in Morehead City, North Carolina. \nThe Georgia-born singer debuted on Columbia Records with \"Down in the Boondocks\" in 1965, which reached No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100. But he struggled to match his initial success with his subsequent records and starting in the late 1980s, he reinvented himself as a country singer. \nHe was known for songs like \"I'll Pin a Note on Your Pillow,\" ''Tell it Like it is,\" and \"Till I Can't Take it Anymore.\" He was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in 1988.
