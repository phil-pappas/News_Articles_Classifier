People used to laugh at me, but ... I believe you should wear your trauma proudly,\" she said.\n\"My blush is from a sunburn I got as a kid.\"\nFlanked by elderly men and women for the gig and interview, the singer, who draws inspiration from French New Wave cinema and Italian directors Michelangelo Antonioni and Federico Fellini, has a somewhat unusual approach for video casting.\n\"Before I shoot a video, I go to the town, I wander in the streets and everyone I have strong eye (contact) with ... I feel they are meant to be in my video,\" she said.\nHer creative team also comes from online encounters that turned into productive collaborations.\n\"It's kind of coincidence that I am meeting people online and creating with them. I call it my little empire,\" she said.\nMeller's new single \"Barbaric\" is released on Nov. 6.\n(Writing by Marie-Louise Gumuchian ; Editing by Ruth Pitchford)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T18:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:41:20.992+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
