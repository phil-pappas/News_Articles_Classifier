It's like my performer persona.\"\nHe enjoys shooting on the streets of Vancouver, Canada, while wearing The Flash costume because it gives him an extra boost of confidence.\n\"I just am a ham in the suit, and I have a lot of fun with any fans that will put up with me,\" he said with a laugh.\nGustin, 25, plays Barry Allen, who discovered he could move at superhuman speed after being struck by lightning. He uses his abilities to help fight crime.\n\"The Flash,\" which airs Tuesday night (8 p.m. EDT), is a spin-off of \"Arrow,\" starring Stephen Amell. The two shows regularly have crossover episodes.\nView gallery In this Monday, Oct. 12, 2015 photo, Grant Gustin poses for a portrait in New York. Gustin, who star … \"They can be a logistic nightmare,\" Gustin said.\n\"I work 12 hours a day every day already on 'Flash,' usually. So, to be like, 'Oh, we're also shooting 'Arrow' this week,' it can be borderline impossible, but when we're on set, and we're all in our costumes, and we're doing the thing, it's fun. And when it's the finished product, it's beyond worth it, and we know how much the fans love it.\"\n\"The Flash,\" now in its second season, will soon have its own spin-off: \"Legends of Tomorrow,\" about heroes and villains teaming up to save the world, will premiere next year.\nOne DC Comics show launching on TV that has no crossover plans as of yet is CBS' \"Supergirl,\" starring Melissa Benoist.\nGreg Berlanti, who is the executive producer of \"The Flash\" and \"Supergirl,\" has said he wants \"Supergirl\" to stand on its own before any crossovers are planned.\nView gallery In this Monday, Oct. 12, 2015 photo, Grant Gustin poses for a portrait in New York. Gustin, who star … Gustin said he would like to see that happen. Benoist was a regular on Fox's \"Glee\" and Gustin was a guest star on the show, though they never had scenes together.\n\"I love Melissa, first of all,\" Gustin said. \"I think she's a great actress. ... She's got an amazing work ethic, and I love that character. ... If both shows could stick around ... it could maybe be something that happens eventually.\"\n___\nFollow Alicia Rancilio at http://www.twitter.com/aliciar\n___\nOnline:\nhttp://www.cwtv.com/shows/the-flash/\nArts & Entertainment Media Grant Gustin", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:45:08.930+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
