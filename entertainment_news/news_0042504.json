'Ant-Man' is getting the sequel treatment with 'Ant-Man and the Wasp,' set for release on July 6, 2018, the studio announced on Thursday.\nPaul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly portrayed the leads in the first film which earned $409.8 million worldwide. The announcement didn't specify whether the actors would reprise their roles, but most Marvel actors are signed up for multi-year contracts.\nThis film will mark the first time a Marvel movie will include the name of a female character in a title. The studio has received criticism in the past for its dearth of female characters. The next will be Captain Marvel, which has been pushed to March of 2019.\nThe studio also announced three untitled films for 2020.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
