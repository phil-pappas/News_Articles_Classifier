Veronica Rocha Contact Reporter \n“Jackass” star Steve-O was sentenced Wednesday to 30 days in the Los Angeles County jail for an anti-SeaWorld stunt in which he climbed atop a crane and shot off fireworks in Hollywood. \nSteve-O, whose real name is Stephen Glover, announced the jail sentence on Instagram , saying he was ready to go to jail for the Aug. 9 stunt. He is set to surrender himself to authorities on Dec. 9, city officials said. \n“Considering I've become a clean and sober, dog-rescuing vegan, I must say I'm ready to go to jail -- not just because it will bring so much attention to the plight of orcas in captivity, but because it's nice to let people know I haven't lost my edge,” the performer said. “What can I say, I'm a jackass.” \nHe pleaded no contest to using fireworks and trespassing, L.A. city attorney’s officials said. Glover had been charged with creating a false emergency, trespassing, using unregistered fireworks, storing fireworks without a permit and possession of fireworks without a permit. \nGlover, 41, was also ordered to serve three years’ probation and stay away from the Hollywood Entertainment District. He may not possess any fireworks or perform any nonapproved stunts or staged fights in L.A. County. \nThe stunt became a spectacle, drawing more than 80 firefighters and a helicopter and triggering numerous 911 calls. \nAs Glover scaled the construction crane, he posted videos and photos of himself on his Facebook page. \n“It's stunt time,” Glover wrote in his first post of the night, which included a nearly five-minute video documenting the initial moments of his daring ascent. \nAfter reaching the top, he photographed a view to the ground showing his shoes standing on a narrow steel beam. In the caption, he wrote: “Did I mention that I'm really high in the air? Hearing sirens now.” \nFire crews prepared an \"air rescue cushion.\" \nThe risky act, he said Wednesday, was meaningful and worth it. \n“I mean, if your goal is to make a statement about captivity, you may as well get yourself locked up!” Glover said. \nWhen Glover scaled the crane, he carried with him an inflatable orca and wore a “Blackfish” T-shirt, making the stunt another of his public demonstrations against SeaWorld, which has been criticized for keeping killer whales in captivity and using them in shows. \nLast year, he was charged with a traffic infraction for an anti-SeaWorld stunt in which he defaced a freeway sign in San Diego. He posted a YouTube video in August 2014 showing him climbing up the freeway sign to attach the word \"sucks'' after the words \"Sea World.\" \nGlover said he plans to give back to Los Angeles by launching a campaign to raise money for at-risk teens. He is raffling off a trip and tickets to the taping of a Showtime comedy special. \nFor breaking California news, follow @VeronicaRochaLA . \nALSO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T20:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:43:42.197+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
