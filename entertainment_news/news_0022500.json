(Photo: Francesco Carrozzini/Cosmopolitan)\n28 CONNECT 60 TWEET LINKEDIN 19 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Move over, Obamas in the White House; there's another \"First Family\" taking up space in America's cultural landscape and their names start with K.\nThe Kardashians sprawl across Cosmopolitan magazine's November cover under the headline \"America's First Family,\" causing outrage on Twitter and among editors of black-oriented media and websites.\nBut the magazine, celebrating its 50th anniversary, says calm down: The cover is just a \"teasing\" way to describe the Kardashians as the \"huge cultural phenomenon\" that they are.\nAnd anyway, if Kim Kardashian's husband, Kanye West, succeeds in his quest to add POTUS to his resume, who knows?\nSO excited to celebrate our 50th birthday with the Kardashian/Jenners! Click the link in bio to find out more and look for the issue on newsstands everywhere 10/13! ðŸŽ‰ #regram @kyliejenner\nA photo posted by Cosmopolitan (@cosmopolitan) on Oct 4, 2015 at 6:16pm PDT\nThe cover, featuring Kim, Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian with Kris, Kylie and Kendall Jenner, all wearing white shirts, promises \"16 Pages! Like You've Never Seen Them Before\" inside.\nThe Kardashians were tweeting and Instagraming their delight about the cover.\nHappy 50th Birthday @cosmopolitan So excited to be on the November cover with my family!!!! ðŸ“· @francescocarrozzini pic.twitter.com/8WN2K1DC3J\nâ€” Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) October 5, 2015 But to some on Twitter, the cover seemed to be deliberate belittling of the real First Family â€” the nation's first African-American First Family: President Obama, first lady Michelle Obama, and their daughters Malia and Sasha.\n@Cosmopolitan Shame on you for that Kardashian first family crap. You people need to get a clue.\nâ€” Tahirah A-Williams (@takbarwi) October 5, 2015 Sorry Cosmo, there's only one First Family of America & it ain't the Kardashians.\n #CosmoFail pic.twitter.com/Su7p51ylqN\nâ€” Eric Wolfson (@EricWolfson) October 5, 2015 I am not a fan of the Obamas in any way, but shame on @Cosmopolitan for calling the Kardashians the \"first family.\" #classless\nâ€” Kenzie (@kenzwall) October 5, 2015 I stopped buying @Cosmopolitan because of the lack of women of color on the front. The entire Kardashian family I will never buy another mag\nâ€” Courtney Nichelle (@courtnichelle) October 5, 2015 The Grio , the website focused on the black community, reported that the cover \"lead many to question just what Cosmo was thinking when the editorial decision to call them the First Family was made.\"\nHuffington Post's \"Black Voices\" blog published a critique under the headline, \"What Cosmopolitan's Kardashians Cover Says About Black Erasure in America.\"\nPhoto spread of Kardashians in November 'Cosmopolitan.' (Photo: Francesco Carrozzini/Cosmopolitan)\nGiven the sex-focused magazine's history, it's not as if they're rookies at writing headlines. In a statement, the magazine explained its thinking.\n\"We are teasing!\" said the emailed statement from Cosmo spokeswoman Lauren Demitry. \"Though who knows, if Kanye runs for president then we may be soothsayers.\n\"The Kardashians and Jenners have more digital followers than any other family, more than 350 million and counting,' the statement continued. \"They are a huge cultural phenomenon. What we do know is there is nothing like the cover of a magazine to provoke a national conversation.\"\nAmen to that. And it should be noted, the real First Family isn't keen on lavish media coverage of their teen girls, who usually are photographed only when they're at a public event with their parents.\nThis is not a problem with the over-sharing Kardashians.\nMalia Obama, Sasha Obama, President Obama, and first lady Michelle Obama in December 2014 at the National Building Museum in Washington.
