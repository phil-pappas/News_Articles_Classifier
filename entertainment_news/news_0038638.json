ERIE, Pa. -- Christmas has come a couple months early to the Erie Playhouse with its farcically fun production of Ken Ludwig's \"The Game's Afoot.\" Charles Corritore directs this comedy, which centers on a 1936 Yuletide get-together hosted by William Gillette, an actor renowned for his portrayal of Sherlock Holmes. When a murder throws a wrench in the festivities, he must rely on his alter ego's sleuthing skills as he teams up with a real detective to sniff out the culprit. The role of the self-aggrandizing but ultimately sweet William is an ideal playground for Rich Tryzbiak, whose finely honed comedic gifts are on full display. He is especially funny -- and charming -- when playing off the delightfully spunky Doris Becker as Martha, William's sharp-as-a-tack mother. Watching this grande dame with eight decades of Erie Playhouse experience gracefully dominate the stage is a joy. The quirky nature of his guests as they interact with each other adds to the fun of the gathering. Kate Amatuzzo brings warmth and complexity to the role of William's former love Aggie, and Michael Burns cranks up the charisma as her current squeeze, Simon. Patrick Thiem and Patty Corella infuse the married Felix and Madge with a worldly sense of wit. Susan Lechner brings sinister sparkle to theater critic Daria Chase, whose withering insults make Simon Cowell look charitable. Though she doesn't appear until the second act, Tracey Hall is thoroughly endearing as the eccentric Inspector Goring, who seems to truly relish her job. The myriad references to Holmes and to the works of Shakespeare are a bonus for theater and literature buffs. Watching Gillette effortlessly lapse into his Holmes persona is especially enjoyable. Meanwhile, Christine Carmichael's striking set is almost a character in itself, equipped with multiple gizmos, innovations and secret panels that facilitate wonderful opportunities for humor. While there is most definitely a mystery at work in this play, it is first and foremost a comedy. In the hands of some of Erie's most talented actors, these characters will keep audience members laughing.
