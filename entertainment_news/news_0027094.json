He desperately needs another big hit. With the likes of Fahadh Faazil, Dulquer Salman and Nivin Pauly making waves in the industry, the two yesteryear stalwarts — Mohanlal and Mammooty — are left playing catch up. This mystery thriller, directed by M. Padmakumar is another shot a glory from the three-time National Award winner. He has an ensemble cast with him. Anoop Menon, Atul Kulkarni, Pratap Pothen and Honey Rose play vital roles in the film. \nThe premise of Kanal is set against the struggles of the life in the Middle East, which has a large Malayali contingent.

As for now, the trailer looks sleek and doesn’t give much away and certainly has the makings of a hit.
