And Belafonte spoke far more positively about young black celebrities than he did two years ago when he chastised Jay Z, Beyonce and others for turning \"their back on social responsibility.\" \nAt the 92nd Street Y in Manhattan, Jay Z was in the audience nodding his head as Belafonte praised him, Usher and Common for renewing a commitment to change after a \"very me\" generation immediately following the civil rights era. \nThink your friends should see this?
