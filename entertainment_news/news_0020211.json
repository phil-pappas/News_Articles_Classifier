But no, you don't need to wait in line at the post office this time: These passports get issued by Facets (1517 W. Fullerton Ave., www.facets.org ), with whimsical stamps issued each time you catch an entry in the Chicago International Children's Film Festival. Running Friday through Nov. 1, this collection of the best new works of children's cinema — more than 200 live-action, animation and documentary films from 44 countries — has something for all tastes and ages. Yes, even for pre-K kids with short attention spans. \n'The Shamer's Daughter' \nWith murder-fueled royal intrigue, a protagonist with special powers and, of course, dragons, this teen version of \"Game of Thrones\" would already be all the buzz among high schoolers, except it was filmed in Denmark with an all-star Scandinavian cast. Adapted from the first book in a series by Danish author Lene Kaaberbol, the story centers on Dina, an adolescent \"witch\" who, like her mother, can peer into a person's soul and know all his secrets. When the royal family gets slaughtered — seemingly by the heir to the throne, who protests his innocence — mother and daughter are both summoned to the castle to confirm the guilt of the accused. Of course nothing is quite so simple. The economical plot ratchets up the sense of dread along with life-or-death stakes, while the special effects belie the film's modest (by Hollywood standards) 7.5 million-euro budget. 11 a.m. Saturday . In Danish with English subtitles. \n'Adama' \nThis animated epic follows the dangerous adventures of a 12-year-old boy who crosses continents for his family. Headstrong but hopelessly naive, our eponymous hero adores his older brother, who secretly leaves his village in West Africa to become a soldier of fortune. Soon, heartbroken Adama is a stowaway on a ship to Europe, hoping to find him. Although set during World War I, the French film has a timeless feel that suits its painterly visuals. Given this coming-of-age story's dire wartime context, it's best seen by kids 12 and up. Also worth noting: \"Adama\" is so admired, it also screens at the Chicago International Film Festival this weekend. 1 p.m. Saturday. In French with English subtitles. \nHere are 10 highlights, among many, in this year's Oct. 15-29 Chicago International Film Festival. All screenings will be at AMC River East 21, 322 E. Illinois St. Go to www.chicagofilmfestival.com for updates and the full schedule. - Michael Phillips (Michael Phillips) \n'Oddball' \nBilled as \" a fairy tale that really happened \" this comedic feel-good feature takes its name from its protagonist, a lovable canine oaf. (Of course, the dog's human, Farmer Swampy, is a peculiar character too.) The Maremma sheepdog isn't very good at watching over chickens, but Oddball finds his purpose protecting penguins on nearby Middle Island, where foxes have decimated the penguin population. As with any film version of a true story, this one's jazzed up with fictional flourishes, including family drama, a mystery and even a cartoonish dogcatcher villain. But the movie's message, not to mention its slapstick humor and the adorable animals, will hit the mark for middle schoolers. (And because \"Oddball\" is Australian, your kids won't have to read subtitles.) 11:15 a.m. Saturday. \nShorts for younger kids \nThe nine-day schedule includes many packages of short films, organized by theme. Although some are targeted to older kids, the collections skew younger because cartoons captivate young ones otherwise prone to squirming. Given that music is one universal language, art another, these collections of international shorts cast their spells with wordless magic. Naturally, styles vary widely: The delightful French \"Lune et le Loup\" uses gorgeous Pixar-esque computer animation to depict a stuffed wolf baby-sitting a cute infant, but it's refreshing to see simpler palettes and sketchier lines in work such as \"Rita and the Crocodile,\" a series of shorts featuring a bossy little girl and her comical pet. \nSee the festival site for the full schedule of shorts programs with age recommendations. \n'VFX: Behind the Scenes at Disney' workshop \nIt's not just movies for nine days —the film festival offers a variety of workshops too. Kids as young as 4 can learn about writing or acting, while older kids can get more intensive experience, learning about animatronics and documentary development. One really great opportunity for kids 10 and up is the chance to delve into a career in animation with Josh Staub, visual-effects supervisor at Walt Disney Animation Studios, where he's contributed to \"Wreck-It Ralph\" and \"Frozen.\" (His own short film, the award-winning \"Mantis Parable,\" played at the children's film festival 10 years ago.) 11 a.m.-12:30 p.m. Nov. 1. \nThe festival runs through Nov. 1 at various locations. Tickets to screenings are $10, $6 for kids 2-18; $45 family pass admits four to all screenings. Workshops cost $15-$45. www.facets.org/children+youth/festival/", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T22:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:41:19.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
