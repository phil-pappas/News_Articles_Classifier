They are well-suited as a couple, but neither is equipped to deal with Evelyn’s sexual assault by a ne’er do well neighbor. His shocking castration, Les’ incarceration, and Evelyn’s social exile forever disrupt the order of the town, and the landscape itself.\nAfter years of caring for younger siblings and being helpmate to her husband, Evelyn suddenly finds herself cast out by family and community, left to fend for herself as a fallen woman.\nLike so many similar women of the day, she takes work caring for the elderly as a nurse and final companion, living in her own hometown as a stranger and passing her relations in the street like a ghost.\nHers is a life of three discrete identities: daughter, wife and pariah.\nAnd, while the townspeople thirst for details of the gory adultery that brought down three families, Evelyn’s private drama is one of constructing a coherent identity for herself amidst the ruins of her past lives.\nThese are the “Three Lives of a Woman” alluded to in Mayhem’s title, but it is a third woman who conveys Evelyn’s story to us, namely Harris’ untraditional and self-reflective female narrator.\nIt is through her interjections that we are able to peek into Harris’ own research process, her personal connection to Central Texas, and the sometimes opaque motivations of Evelyn Kunkle herself.\nIn this way, the many-layered female identities make for an interesting read of the complicated and troubling subject of sexual assault as it affects personal identity.\nIn short, Harris’s book is a delicacy for the reader with a taste for old Southern manners, pastoral landscapes and colloquial language.\nAmy Ritthaler Gilmour is a San Antonio writer and critic.
