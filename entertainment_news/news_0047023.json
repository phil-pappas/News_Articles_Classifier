The winner declined to comment when contacted at home by The Ledger. \nThe Super Cash scratch-off game costs $20. The card has six winning numbers and 20 numbers for play. If any of the play numbers matches any of the winning numbers, the player wins the prize indicated beneath the matched number, up to a $1 million grand prize.
