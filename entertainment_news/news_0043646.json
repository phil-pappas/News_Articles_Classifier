Universally acclaimed as the world's best Santana tribute, the band perform all the crowd-pleasers, from early hits such as Jin-Go-Lo-Ba, Samba Pa Ti and Soul Sacrifice to Carlos Santana's modern repertoire, including Smooth, Corazón Espinado and Maria Maria. \nThey promise a fiesta-tinged show that will have feet tapping from the first chink of a tambourine to the get-up-and-boogie finale. \nThe band is led by Milan 'Carlos' Webb, a virtuoso guitarist with a technique and tone to match Santana himself, who not only sounds the part, but looks the part too. But it's not just about guitar. Hector Gomez (yes, he's Spanish) and Auriol Kobani ensure the vocals (and the stage act) are up to the mark, while Paul 'Murph' Murphy is a powerhouse behind the percussion rig.

At the Central Studio Theatre, just as everywhere we play, our focus will be on entertaining – we like to see people get up and dance.\" \nBased in the Thames Valley, the band is making waves across the UK, and is touring extensively to promote its new CD.
