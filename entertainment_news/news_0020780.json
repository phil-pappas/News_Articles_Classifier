Dip into these \"Best American\" volumes along with USA TODAY.\nThe Best American Mystery Stories 2015\nJames Patterson, editor\nMariner, 394 pp.\n3 stars out of four\nBest-selling author James Patterson guest edits this year’s collection with both the mystery lover and movie-goer in mind. Opining a lack of originality in current cinema, Patterson chooses some truly original short stories, reminding Hollywood, and readers, that quite a few classic films started out in this medium. Fittingly, Michael Connelly and Dennis Lehane’s solid Red Ey e reminds us why the character of Harry Bosch has such appeal. Jeffrey Deaver’s chilling The Adventure of the Laughing Fisherman and Joyce Carol Oates’ haunting The Home of Craigmillnar remind us that things that aren’t always as they appear. Newcomer Tomiko M. Breland’s turns the classic “who-done-it” structure on its head in Rosalee Carrasco . Many of these tales feature unconventional narratives; all will have you on the edge of your seat.\n-- Mary Cadden\nAndrew McCarthy atop Kilimanjaro.

(Photo: Courtesy Simon & Schuster)\nThe Best American Travel Writing 2015\nAndrew McCarthy, editor\nMariner, 360 pp.\n3.5 stars\nAward-winning travel writer and guest editor Andrew McCarthy opens with this observation: “Travel, I was convinced, was not something frivolous, to be indulged in merely by the idle or the wealthy or the unshowered backpacker. It was something worth fighting for.” Not much frivolity can be found in the 24 stories McCarthy has chosen. Former Marine Benjamin Busch returns to Iraq 10 years after he “invaded” it only to find that it has descended into dysfunction. Lauren Quinn travels to northern Cambodia to hear a pitch from an ex-Khmer Rouge cadre to invest in a museum to be filled with artifacts of atrocity. David Farley explores Varanasi, a city in northeastern India where many pilgrims go to die. The stories are all beautifully written, but the inclusion of lighter fare such as satirical writer Gary Shteyngart’s hilarious analysis of hotel sex by geography and brand is a welcome break. (Hyatt, he claims, is the lustiest hotel chain in the world.) Tony Perrottet surprises with his portrayal of China as a producer of wine, cheese and foie gras. (Take that, France.) Nick Paumgarten brings Berlin alive by taking readers inside its sexiest nightclubs. And Monte Reel crosses South America by bus on the Interoceanic Highway, the first paved route connecting Peru to Brazil. “Tell me a story, don’t sell me a destination,” McCarthy requests in his forward. These writers have certainly complied.\n-- Nancy Trejos\nThe Best American Comics 2015\nJonathan Lethem, editor\nHoughton Mifflin Harcourt, 400 pp.\n3 stars\nNot only does Jonathan Lethem choose some of the best stuff in the comics medium, he goes one better and artfully introduces this year’s collection, which, as in recent years, does lean toward the quirky. (A phantasmagoria of weird called \"76 Manifestations of American Destiny\" by David Sandlin is a trippy pastiche of psychedelic planets and Ed “Big Daddy” Roth military hot rods.) In addition to nicely categorizing all the selections — from “Raging Her-Moans” to “Brainworms” — Lethem has picked some super bits of storytelling, including excerpts from Farel Dalrymple’s dystopian-kids epic \"The Wrenchies,\" Diane Obomswain’s lesbian coming-of-age \"Mathilde’s Story\" (featuring one of two appearances in the book from Wonder Woman), Joe Sacco’s visceral battleground of \"The Great War\", and \"Can’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?,\" Roz Chast's graphic memoir about aging parents that was a National Book Award finalist last year.\n-- Brian Truitt\n'The Best American Comics' 2015 (Photo: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt)\nThe Best American Nonrequired Reading 2015\nAdam Johnson, editor\nMariner, 410 pp.\n3 stars\nSelected by groups of high schoolers in San Francisco and Ann Arbor, Mich., this eclectic collection soars more often than it sags. Traveling to exotic locales ranging from Ethiopia’s lush valleys ( Out of Eden Walk ) to Iraq’s perilous mountains ( 780 Days of Solitude ), the non-fiction selections and blow-by-blow accounts of athletes including figure skater Nancy Kerrigan ( Remote Control ) and wrestler Andre the Giant ( Andre the Giant ) are all mildly engaging, if – as the title suggests – nonessential. But the stories that truly stick are those that are slightly unnerving and offbeat, of which there are many. Fiction highlights include Fear Itself , about a teenage girl who falls in lust with a lascivious Franklin D. Roosevelt museum wax figure; Chainsaw Fingers , which follows a military vet who becomes a small-town freak show when his amputated appendages are replaced by tiny saws; and Things You’re Not Proud Of , charting a man’s horror as his wife kills the tiny people living in their bathtub drain. The pieces may not be for everybody, but you’ve got to hand it to these bright students (with guidance from editor Adam Johnson) for having an eye for the unusual.\n-- Patrick Ryan\n4 CONNECT 25 TWEET LINKEDIN //usat.ly/1N0Bzfu TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1N0Bzfu&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0cb81f5523aeac6cc544de5f88aacba084f34860/c=5-0-3995-3000&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/635806082501327550-XXX-MCCARTHY-LONGEST-BOOKS-1907.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c8c796fe9930e283d2aa7c15c7aa3c61df8cca49/c=0-116-1400-1983&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/635806065335757515-BAMS-2015.Patterson.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/635806065335757515-BAMS-2015.Patterson.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1N0Bzfu", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1N0Bzfu&text=Dip%20into%20%22Best%20American%22%20writing%20of%202015&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/72c9fa6a24536d2873aa70cae3dbb1260b1f8e95/c=19-0-1382-1817&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/10/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/635806069181494167-Jacket-Artwork---BAC15.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b2e9b23cd767d8a10443c055f0220c24d0200e88/r=266x400/local/-/media/2015/10/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/635806065335757515-BAMS-2015.Patterson.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-25T15:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T15:16:55.757+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
