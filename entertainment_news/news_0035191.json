Scoop up a few handfuls of Halloween candy, turn off the lights, drag a friend to the couch and log onto your favourite streaming service. It’s that special time of year, when giving your nerves a jolt of terror feels like the right thing to do. \nIf you’re looking through Canadian streaming services, you’ll be able to find some excellent horror options – from vintage titles like The Omen on Netflix to modern films like Let the Right One In on Shomi. You could also spend the week leading up to Halloween binging through a creepy TV series that you haven’t checked out yet, such as The Walking Dead on Netflix or American Horror Story on Shomi. \nCraveTV doesn’t have many movies in its arsenal, but you’ll be able to find classic Halloween episodes from shows like South Park, The Twilight Zone, Cheers, Frasier, Community, Curb Your Enthusiasm and others. \nIf you’re browsing for horror movies to stream, we’ve got you covered. After perusing the available options on Netflix, Shomi and Crackle, we’ve come up with a few somewhat under-the-radar titles that we’d like to recommend for your Halloween viewing pleasure. These might not be considered classics – there’s no Exorcist or Carrie on this list – but they’re definitely worth a watch, especially if you missed them the first time around. \nCREEP (2014): This flick takes a fresh approach to the tired found-footage genre by adding elements of dark comedy. Creep follows what happens when a videographer named Aaron (Patrick Brice) answers a cryptic Craigslist ad, and then finds himself stuck in a remote cabin with the strange Josef (Mark Duplass), a terminally ill man who wants to film a video for his unborn son. Make sure you stick around for the second half. That’s when things really get weird. \nFIND IT ON: NETFLIX \nTHE DESCENT (2005): This claustrophobic story introduces us to six women on a caving expedition, who decide to explore unmapped caverns in the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina. “If there’s no risk, then what’s the point?” says a character early on in the film, before she encounters a pretty risky situation – being trapped in dark caves and getting hunted by a group of “crawlers”, humanoid-like creatures that enjoy feasting on flesh. \nFIND IT ON: SHOMI, CRACKLE \nTHE ENFIELD HAUNTING (2015): We’re mainly talking about movies in this list, but this three-part mini-series deserves a mention. Shomi recently started streaming The Enfield Haunting – even non-Shomi subscribers could find the entire first episode on its Facebook page this past weekend – about a real-life poltergeist case that caused a media storm in England in the late-‘70s. Next year’s Conjuring sequel centres around the same story. \nFIND IT ON: SHOMI \nMANIAC (2012): Elijah Wood stars as the withdrawn owner of a mannequin store – doesn’t this already sound unsettling? – who discovers a fetish for scalping women. It’s definitely an intense film, and the star said in a 2013 interview that he’s “never played someone so dark before.” Interestingly, almost the entire movie is shown from the killer’s perspective, with Wood mainly appearing in reflections or flashbacks. \nFIND IT ON: NETFLIX \nTHE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES (2002): This X-Files-style story explores the myth of the mothman, a creature spotted in West Virginia in the late-‘60s. Based on the 1975 book by John Keel, Richard Gere plays a reporter who gets caught in a confusing and terrifying situation. The phone conversation with a character named Indrid Cold will creep you out for days. \nFIND IT ON: SHOMI \nREC (2007): This Spanish film is perfect for a quick jolt, since it has a brisk running time of 78 minutes. It uses the found-footage style and shaky cam technique to tell the story of a reporter and cameraman, who find themselves trapped in an apartment building during a zombie outbreak. The filmmakers shot this movie chronologically and didn’t give their actors full scripts – so that apprehension you see in the movie is real, since the performers didn’t know when their characters would die until the day of filming. \nFIND IT ON: CRACKLE \nTHE STRANGERS (2008): Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman star as a young couple staying in a vacation home, who get terrorized by three people wearing masks. It’s a simple concept, but director Bryan Bertino does a solid job of building the tension, prioritizing suspense over gore. Tagged as being “inspired by true events,” don’t even think about watching this one at the cottage. \nFIND IT ON: NETFLIX, SHOMI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:42:35.084+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
