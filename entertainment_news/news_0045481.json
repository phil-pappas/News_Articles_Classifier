The second thing I think of is how I spent years singing \"party in the street with the heaters on\" when his song \" Welcome to Miami \" was big many moons ago, only to later learn that those were not in any way close to being the actual lyrics. \"Party in the city where the heat is on\" makes way more sense. Miami is hot. Why would they need heaters?\nSince his last release (2005's Lost and Found ) he immersed himself in acting, releasing nine major films in the wake of his last musical endeavor. But now he's back on the mic to \"get jiggy with it.\" (Had to.)\nFor the first time in ten years, we have some new music from Smith, BUT it's not actually a Will Smith song, per se. Turns out he's such a big fan of Colombian group Bomba Est√©reo that he dusted off his vocal chords to contribute a few bars to the remix of their song \"Fiesta.\" Have a listen:", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nCqRmx3Dnw", "https://www.facebook.com/BombaEstereo?fref=ts", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Smith_filmography", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/K5c3cxNLwYQ", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwBS6QGsH_4"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:42:30.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
