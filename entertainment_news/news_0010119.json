You're talking to me, not to them.\"\"Alright, I'll tell it straight,\" Noise countered. \"The first audition I watched on Saturday, people had 10 minute slots. And I went to 47 seconds.\"Cowell then told Noise that he was \"five seconds from being thrown off this stage\" before adding: \"If you've got a problem just go.\" © ITV / Thames/Syco/Fremantle Media But Noise wasn't giving up easily, telling the crowd: \"I'm doing this for you. I'm doing this for entertainment. I'm doing this for artists. This is real.\"The whole thing soon turned into a pretty serious argument, with Cowell telling Noise to \"shut up\" and accusing him of insulting the producers who spent hours editing his tape.In the end it all got too much for Noise, who simply threw his mic to the ground and marched off the stage, much to the shock of his fellow contestants and the crowd. © ITV / Thames/Syco/Fremantle Media While Rita Ora labelled his outburst \"the Kanye West effect\", a disappointed Nick Grimshaw said \"he would have had a chair\".But Noise didn't seem too bothered by his failure to win a chair, simply saying: \"I've done what I need to do.\"The X Factor returns next Sunday (October 18) at 7pm on ITV.
