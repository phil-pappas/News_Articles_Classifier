Can a book really transform the way we feel? Can it lighten your mood, ensure a better night's sleep, steal away loneliness?\n\"This year we are challenging Scots from all walks of life to try this miracle cure out for themselves - and to share their stories and results with us in a celebration of all the things books and reading can do.\nPromoted stories \"This challenge sits at the centre of Book Week Scotland, but the full programme is many and varied, and offers something for everyone on a national basis.\"\nThere will also be appearances by the likes of Brian Blessed and Cathy Rentzenbrink in unusual locations across the country.\nDuring the week, 150,000 free copies of a short story and poem collection written by ordinary Scottish people, Journeys, will be handed out via libraries, bookshops and other outlets.\nIn addition to this three free picture books, comprising the shortlist for the Scottish Children's Book Awards 2016, will be gifted to every Primary 1 pupil in Scotland.\nOrganisations across Scotland will also be encouraged and supported to transform neglected areas of their office into a dedicated reading area, where staff can retreat to enjoy some relaxation and escapism with a good book.\nTo round off the week Scottish Book Trust will reveal the most shareable Quote: from a book. Word lovers can choose from a shortlist of 40 Quote: s when voting opens on Tuesday.\nThe top three Quote: s that people would most like to share with their friends will be revealed on November 26.\nInitiated by the Scottish Government and supported, along with a Readers in Residence programme in libraries, by Â£250,000 from Creative Scotland, Book Week Scotland will be delivered by Scottish Book Trust.\nBook Week Scotland in libraries is funded by The Scottish Library and Information Council.\nShare article Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop said: \"Book Week Scotland is a wonderful opportunity to celebrate reading and literature. The pleasure of reading cannot be underestimated.\n\"As well as broadening the mind and nourishing the soul, reading provides a range of mental health and wellbeing benefits that should not be ignored.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-06T20:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T21:37:41.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
