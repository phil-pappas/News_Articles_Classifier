As we reported a few days ago, Ubisoft's film chief is drawing comparisons between Assassin's Creed and Blade Runner and, if these few measly set photos tell us anything, it's that they're going into the sci-fi aspect of it quite well.\nTake a look.\nWalking for the very first time inside of Abstergo was an amazing experience!

This little image is telling in that it obviously points to how accurate and faithful they'll be to the original games, whilst still ploughing their own furrow. We won't know anything for quite some time yet, but in the meantime, we can pour over these and make up wild theories of our own.\nPosted by Access the Animus on Saturday, 10 October 2015\nStart firing them off in the comments below!\nVia Twitter / Facebook\nMORE: Studio chief says Assassin's Creed film will be like 'Batman Begins' or 'Blade Runner'\nMORE: Pic: Here's our first look at Michael Fassbender's Assassin's Creed movie\nMORE: Watch: New trailer for Steve Jobs confirms Fassbender's due an Oscar", "external_links": ["http://t.co/xzOAl8LMzW", "https://www.facebook.com/AccessTheAnimus", "http://t.co/QhTmnwbOxV", "https://www.facebook.com/AccessTheAnimus/photos/a.368664643234451.1073741825.340276136073302/707207112713534/?type=3", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/assassinscreedmovie?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/AymarMtl/status/653987687028928512", "https://twitter.com/AymarMtl", "https://twitter.com/AymarMtl/status/654010941038792704"], "published": "2015-10-14T22:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:19:04.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
