(HHC) – The 5th Annual World Cheese Dip Championship Benefiting Harmony Health Clinic will be held at the Bernice Garden on Main Street on Saturday, October 31, 2015. \nThis year marks the fifth year of the World Cheese Dip Championship. Over the last four events, over 20,000 people representing almost every county in Arkansas as well as most of the U. S., have come together to show their love for cheese dip and join together where it all started over 70 years ago – right here in Central Arkansas. Both Professional and Amateur divisions will be judged, and everyone will have their chance to vote on the best cheese dip through the People's Choice Awards. In addition, a professional panel of cheesy experts will be prepared to crown the Fifth World Cheese Dip Champion! Return of the 'Rock Town Bacon Throwdown' \n“Each year, we try to add a new dimension to the event. This year we are proud to be bringing local musical artists and entertainers who will ramp up the fun and the atmosphere. Local bands Whale Fire and The Kinders are a couple of acts already lined up for this year, and we hope to continue to add to the roster,” said Event Chairman and President, Marc Verbos. “We anticipate 2015 will be another record-breaking year to provide great exposure and promotion for restaurants, the City of Little Rock, plus Harmony Health Clinic, and the music this year will be amazing!” added Marc. \nThe World Cheese Dip Championship has drawn national attention from news and food shows and blogs, renowned chefs, and magazines, but 100% of the proceeds go to benefit Harmony Health Clinic. Harmony Health Clinic provides free medical and dental care to fellow Arkansans needing support. Harmony has provided more than $6.3million in medical care and 12,000+ patient visits yet is fully funded through grants and donations. \n(Source: Harmony Health Clinic) The 5th Annual World Cheese Dip Championship Benefiting Harmony Health Clinic will be held at the Bernice Garden on Main Street on Saturday, October 31, 2015. --THV11.com 10/26/15 KTHV Read or Share this story: http://on.kthv.com/1S5XcLF TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T14:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T15:06:06.279+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
