Although some musicians, like Samini and Okyeame Kwame have reinvented themselves to do live performances, some are adamant. \nCommenting on the situation during an interview on Personality Profile on Joy FM with Lexis Bill Thursday, Prof John Collins said musicians miming is a big problem in Ghana. \n“I don’t think you can go anywhere if you have a band that mimes. I think it started with the burger highlife musicians and it continued with a lot of the hiplifers. I know some are now begging to perform live.” \nHe cited that, for example, “If you go a programme in America or Europe and you put on your record on stage and mime to it, there is likely to be a riot [and] people will just throw their chairs at you. They will demand their money back because when they are going for a live show, they don’t imagine you can go to a show [where] people are miming.” \nApart from the miming, the music professor expressed worry at the incorporation of “too much mechanics” in Ghanaian music today. \nHe advised that musicians can combine live music like drums and the electronics to achieve good music. \n“In the West, a lot of people have reacted against the over computerisation of music. They want to have live music. I think you have to have a balance of these things,” Prof John Collins added. \n\nFollow me on Twitter: @delaXdela and Instagram: citizendela", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T12:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:01:48.305+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
