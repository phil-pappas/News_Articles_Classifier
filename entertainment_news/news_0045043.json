Pufnstuf is coming back to television, and he’s bringing a few old pals along with him. \nThe title character of the 1969-71 children’s series will appear on an episode of Nickelodeon’s new preschool series “Mutt & Stuff,” the cable channel said Tuesday. \nPufnstuf will be joined by Freddy the Flute and Cling and Clang on a “Mutt & Stuff” episode taping next month. It’s scheduled to air in early 2016. \n“Mutt & Stuff” is produced by Sid and Marty Krofft, the same brothers who produced “H.R. Pufnstuf.” That show is still in reruns more than four decades after it debuted. Join the conversation Sign in to comment (not connected to your Insider Club login).
