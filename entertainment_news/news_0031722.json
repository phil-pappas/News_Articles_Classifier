Pic/Santa Banta \nThe 51-year-old star said it's quite natural for young men to be attracted to older women, while adding: \"We should not be worried about age when it comes to love and attraction,\" reports mirror.co.uk.\n\"Just as younger women are attracted to older men, it shouldn't be considered strange that men in their 20s and 30s are drawn to older women. It's the chemistry and energy between men and women that counts... True sexiness is in the mind, the imagination, not in the age of the body,\" she said.\nBellucci is the oldest Bond girl in the history of the iconic film franchise, but she isn't bothered by her age.\n\"This is a beautiful and rich period from a professional point of view. As far as my private life is concerned, I'm a mother with two daughters, and so I don't have much time to rest!\n\"But I feel very energised right now and I've gained the kind of wisdom over the years where I'm able to appreciate all the beautiful and small things that are part of everyday life,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:54:22.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
