Pic/AFP \nAnd while the news may not please some of the people and their families, Sharon, 63 - who has daughters Kelly, 30, and Aimee, 32, and son Jack, 29 - insists she never intends to 'hurt people' with the things she does and says but doesn't see the problem with having an opinion.\n\"A lot of people really don't like others being opinionated, they would rather you sit on the fence instead of having a strong opinion on something. I get it but that doesn't mean I still don't put my foot in my mouth - I do! I've always been very opinionated.
