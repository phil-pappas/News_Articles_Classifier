After the footballs are packed away and the clink of dumbbells fades, the Bears offensive coordinator leads his assistant coaches into a meeting room where their puzzle pieces lay spread on the table.\nThat's a weekly procedure at every NFL team's headquarters. But in Lake Forest over the last month, the Bears' puzzle has been more vexing than coach John Fox's staff anticipated.\nInjuries to key players have blurred the design and smoothed the edges so that few pieces easily or obviously fit together.\n•Quarterback Jay Cutler: hobbled by a strained hamstring.\n•Top receiver Alshon Jeffery: can't conquer his leg muscle injuries.\n•First-round rookie receiver Kevin White: likely out for the season.\nLine in debilitating flux\nThey have left the Bears offense striving for balance and consistency, while trying to ignore the natural question: what if?\nAnd yet, there's something about this plight that scratches Gase's competitive itch in his third season as an NFL coordinator and play-caller. For a coach widely considered a rising star, it's a challenge unlike anything he faced the last two seasons with a relatively healthy Broncos offense led by quarterback Peyton Manning.\n\"The thing that I've enjoyed the most,\" Gase said, \"is our staff trying to find the best ways to put our guys in the best positions to help them succeed.\n\"We're not hanging our hat on 'Hey, this is our system. Go out and execute it.' We're saying, 'Here are our players. What can we do to put them in the best position possible?'\"\nIt's a collaborative effort, to be sure. As is common throughout the league, game-planning duties are spread among the Bears' offensive assistants as a starting point for meetings on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday nights.\nAll of them, though, must adjust to information from the Bears' medical staff. And so far the constraints have been painful.\nA new challenge arose this week ahead of Sunday's road game against the Chiefs: replacing veteran center Will Montgomery, who's out for the season with a broken left fibula.\nThe dilemma equates to another backup in need of coaching and confidence, and another round of strategic planning.\nGase and his staff only push forward.\n\"There's no time to feel sorry for yourself about the injuries,\" quarterbacks coach Dowell Loggains said. \"What if we had Alshon? What if we had Kevin White? It's irrelevant. Coach Fox and Adam are not going to allow us to think that way.\"\nNot in Denver anymore\nFor better or worse, Gase always will be linked to the 2013 Broncos who scored more points than any team in NFL history and gained the second-most yards all time. Their 37.9 points per game and 457-yard average seemed like stats from a video game.\nIt's a well-deserved badge of honor for the 37-year-old Gase. But it's also a standard against which he will be measured now that his career has diverted from Manning and some of the talented personnel on that offense, which included three other Pro Bowlers that season.\nNow, league observers have a natural curiosity about what Gase can do in situations such as Week 3 last month when the Bears played the Seahawks on the road without Cutler and Jeffery and finished the game without left tackle Jermon Bushrod.\nAnd in truth, Gase is asking himself the same question.\n\"That drives Adam a little bit, that competitiveness,\" Loggains said. \"Like, 'Hey, no one thinks we can get this guy up to speed this quickly, so let's find a way to find a game plan that fits him.'\"\nGase reflected this week on the fireworks show of 2013, fully aware of how talent fueled what the Broncos accomplished. And their offense had a sparkling bill of health compared to this year's Bears. Other than left tackle Ryan Clady being lost for the season in Week 2, that starting 11 stayed almost totally intact.\nBut there were other elements at work, some of which he has established Chicago, such as scheme creativity and flexibility.\n\"What we started to do that year,\" Gase said, \"was we wanted to play with a different tempo.\"\nGase brought that hurry-up offense to the Bears, along with some zone-read option concepts Cutler hadn't executed before.\nThe Broncos' success also stemmed from intangibles. The addition of receiver Wes Welker had a major impact on practices, Gase recalled.\n\"Our guys saw him work on a daily basis,\" he said. \"'Wow this guy is 31 years old, and he grinds every play like he's trying to make the team.' Practices became really competitive. That helps.\"\nAs that parallels to the Bears' situation, the challenge for coaches has centered more on developing inexperienced players physically and mentally.\n\"Do you have the confidence to say, 'I'm ready to be a starter?'\" Gase said. \"Sometimes it takes a thrust to go in there and just be like, 'I do belong.\"\nBackup receiver Josh Bellamy has garnered that type of attention because of injuries up the depth chart.\n\"If you don't have a clear picture of what Gase sees, he tries to help you see,\" Bellamy said. \"If you're going to work hard, he can work with you.\"\nA harsh self-critic\nAt times during the last four weeks, some of the Bears' lowest moments have flashed back to Gase's mind and bitten him.\nLike when he was watching video of an opponent and saw a defensive alignment similar to the one from which Packers linebacker Clay Matthews intercepted Cutler in Week 1.\nOr driving to work weighed down by regret about not having backup quarterback Jimmy Clausen go to the air earlier in the 26-0 loss to the Seahawks.\nWhether that's an obsession or just a competitive drive, Gase has emerged as highly self-critical — a particularly heavy burden given the Bears' personnel obstacles.\n\"I owe it as a play-caller to the coaches and players to make sure they know you're holding yourself accountable,\" Gase said. \"If I'm talking to them about, 'Don't make the same mistake twice,' and I go out and make the same mistake twice, they're going to sit there and say, 'He doesn't even do it right.'\"\nThe relentless nature of the NFL's weekly schedule prevents him from fixating on a misstep for too long. But it's a constant battle.\nAs a boy, Gase observed how his father, Art, went about his job as a plant manager for different companies, dealing with logistics and operations.\n\"He was very meticulous,\" Gase said. \"He strived for perfection. He was harder on himself than anybody else.\"\nOnce he started down his coaching path, he encountered mentors who were the same way — Nick Saban, Mike Martz and Josh McDaniels.\nBy now, it's innate. The key is to ensure it's a productive endeavor. Gase's colleagues sense it is.\n\"He'll admit it when he makes a mistake or when he thinks his performance could have been better, just like the players',\" Loggains said. \"All the guys feel like they're in it together. It's 'us.' It's 'we' have to improve.\"\nWorking the puzzle\nNFL coaches are not magicians and victories don't appear out of thin air. If the injury report is long enough or includes certain names, there are uncompromising realities in a sport based so heavily on personnel matchups.\nOf course, that doesn't stop them from trying. So on Monday night, as usual, Bears assistants started formulating a game plan for the Chiefs.\nElements of the running game were divided between running backs coach Stan Drayton, offensive line coach Dave Magazu and tight ends coach Frank Smith. Receivers coach Mike Groh handled third down and Loggains focused on the red zone. Coaches studied video, then collaborated.\n\"It makes it a really nice conversation,\" Gase said.\nThe weekly discussion includes parameters regarding personnel, which the medical staff establishes. Coaches begin with an understanding of who's definitely available for the game, then seek advantageous matchups and concepts.\n\"We'll say, 'Who does that really well?'\" Gase explained. \"If we don't have anybody who does that really well, we'll throw it out. You don't want to try to force a guy to do something he's not really good at.\"\nThe extent of the search through four games has produced some intriguing alignments and personnel groupings: three tight ends, Wildcat formation and five eligible receivers lined up wide, to name a few. And the process continues during games.\n\"He's rotating sets and seeing how they're playing everything, so we can set up our plan,\" tight end Zach Miller said. \"If it's not the look that he wants, maybe go a different direction.\"\nSo, really, Adam Gase's Bears offense is constantly evolving. What it is, no one can definitively say until the season is over.\nYes, there's a foundation. But so far injuries have prevented a direct path to the grand vision Gase had at the start of training camp.\nCan it eventually get there?\n\"It's hard to say yes to that because the season is so ever-changing,\" he said. \"Right now, this is where we're at. Four weeks from now, we might look totally different scheme-wise.\"\nFor Gase, that's the beauty of it.\nrcampbell@tribpub.com\nTwitter @Rich_Campbell\nPrivacy Policy Adam Gase Chicago Bears NFL Denver Broncos Seattle Seahawks Peyton Manning Kevin White", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56189633/turbine/ct-adam-gase-bears-offense-special-spt-1011-20151010"], "published": "2015-10-10T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:26:54.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
