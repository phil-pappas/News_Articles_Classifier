Related Content Trump hoping for 2020 matchup against Kanye \nObama is also scheduled to speak at the fundraiser, according to the event's website. \nAccording to an NBC Bay Area report, West is expected to perform music from his new album \"Swish,\" which includes the single \"All Day.\" However, it is unclear if West will debut new music from \"Swish\" at the afternoon concert. West representatives did not respond to requests for comment. \nWest declared a possible 2020 presidential bid at last month's MTV Video Music awards and is no stranger to politics or political statements. He has been outwardly supportive of Obama and also performed at MTV & ServiceNation's \"Live From The Youth Inaugural Ball\" in January 2009 in celebration of Obama being sworn in. \nHe also famously slammed President George W. Bush during the aftermath of hurricane Katrina in 2005 by declaring that \"George Bush doesn't care about black people,\" and recently, West attended a fundraiser in August for Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. \nClinton posted a selfie with the rapper and hip-hop mogul and his reality star wife Kim Kardashian, with the caption \"new friends\" on the night of the first Republican debate. \nWest recently stood by his own plans to run for president in 2020 in a Vanity Fair interview published last week, saying that a presidential bid is still possible. \nWhen asked about West's potential plans for run for president by \"Extra\" host Mario Lopez, Clinton said, \"Well, if I'm going for my second term, (I would ask him) to wait four years, but if I'm not ... be sure he has comfortable shoes because there's a lot of walking involved.\" \nWest also turned some heads when he called Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson a \"brilliant guy.\" \n\"As soon as I heard Carson speak, I tried for three weeks to get on the phone with him. I was like this is the most brilliant guy. And I think all the people running right now have something that each of the others needs,\" West told Vanity Fair. \nHe added that \"this gladiator battle takes away from the main focus that the world needs help and the world needs all the people in a position of power or influence to come together.\" \nCarson told reporters in a New Hampshire press conference on Wednesday that he did eventually speak with West by phone, saying West \"just wanted to talk.\" \nCarson said the two spoke about a range of issues, including ways for West and \"his colleagues in the rap arena\" to address social problems in the black community. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource .
