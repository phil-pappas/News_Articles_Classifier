Baka naman ’yung kabila? Nagtatanong lang po.”\nA grateful Lea then tweeted Joey a few days later, “I’ll take this to mean that you’re at least giving me the benefit of the doubt. For that, thank you very much.”\nAlden Richards and Maine ‘Yaya Dub’ Mendoza\nJoey also replied to Lea saying they should just start “a whole new world” – obviously referring to the song from “Alladin” which she sang — and leave the issue behind.\nHappy with Joey’s positive response, she posted, “Same to you!!! My best to everyone in EB Land!!!”\nMeanwhile, asked on dzBB if he’s worried about AlDub reaching “saturation point,” Joey said, “Nasa mga tao ’yan. Pwedeng may ibang katauhan pagdating ng panahon. Pwedeng hindi na lovers, pwedeng iba na ang tinatalakay sa buhay ng Pilipino, ibang values na ang tinututukan, ibang kaugalian ang tinatalakay. Abangan natin. Hanggang may kalye, may ‘Eat Bulaga!’ Hanggang may kalye, may Kalyeserye.”\nJoey admitted he and his co-hosts Tito and Vic Sotto are still trying to understand the phenomenon.\n“Kami nagugulat hanggang ngayon. Walang makapagpaliwanag nang mabuti. Ang pinakamadaling sabihin, ang isang magandang bagay na nangyayari ay ipagpasalamat mo na lang sa Maykapal. Tingin namin, regalo talaga ang Kalyeserye. Siguro naman may nagawa kaming mabuti in 36 years,” he said.\nAsked how long they plan to stretch the gag, he said, “Basta nag-e-enjoy kami. Ngayon, kung hindi na nag-e-enjoy ang mga tao sa enjoyment namin, ibang usapan na. Lumipat ka kung ganu’n. Hindi na namin ito tinatawag na pagkakakitaan. Pagkakakitaan ng aliw, ganu’n na.”", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:54:02.997+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
