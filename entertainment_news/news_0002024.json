SCRS-IL is one of 28 ILCs in California opening doors to independence for individuals with SCIs by providing a range of programs and services, notably assistive technology services and education.\n\"In serving people with SCIs, staff members reflect our philosophy of supporting persons with disabilities to transform their lives by making their own choices on how they live, work and participate in their communities,\" noted Interim SCRS-IL's Executive Director Mario Galdamez . \"The programs and services we offer are designed to educate and increase the skill levels of individuals living with disabilities.\"\nThrough assistive technology (AT) services, SCRS-IL offers individuals with SCIs the opportunity to access technology as one means to living independently. AT includes a broad range of devices such as scooters and wheelchairs, remote controls, accessible keyboards and communication devices or more complex items such as durable medical equipment and home modifications. When combined with training, individuals learn how to use the equipment and become more self-sufficient.\nSCRS-IL also conducts monthly disability-related presentations and workshops, tailored for SCIs at the Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center (Rancho) in Downey, CA. One such workshop is the drum circle, designed to enhance brain activity for spinal cord repair and improve sensations and movement for individuals with SCIs. By partnering with Rancho's occupational and physical therapy staff, SCRS-IL can increase the level of resources and services provided to individuals with SCIs and their families. Additionally, SCRS-IL participates in Rancho's annual Spinal Injury Games that provide individuals with SCIs an opportunity to engage in a variety of wheelchair sports.\n\"One of our consumers, who is participating in this year's Spinal Injury Games in October, came to us in 2013\" said Ignacio Gonzalez , SCRS-IL's Service Coordinator/Independent Living Advocate. \"He sought help from us on his application process for the position of Wellness Ally at Rancho, where he actively participated in rehab programs and the SCI support group for men. We helped him develop a résumé and personal reference page, which contributed to his landing the job. He has mentioned that both SCRS-IL and Rancho are 'amazing' and have 'changed his life.'\"\nIn addition to the above programs and services, SCRS-IL continues tackling the obstacles of a lack of funding for equipment and devices as well as inaccessible and unaffordable housing. SCRS-IL is breaking down barriers to Independent Living by creating a documentary film to educate stakeholders on the critical need to prioritize accessible sidewalks and curb cuts in several neighborhoods of Los Angeles County . Additionally, SCRS-IL supported the inclusion of Hector Ochoa as a new commissioner on the Los Angeles County Commission on Disabilities who will be the leading voice in advocating for all persons with disabilities, not limited to the SCRS-IL catchment area.\n\"The SCI services provided by SCRS-IL is one example of the type of work being done to maximize the independence of individuals with disabilities,\" concluded California State Independent Living Council Executive Director Liz Pazdral . \"By understanding and addressing the unique realities of individuals living with SCIs, ILCs are well prepared to increase opportunities for living independently.\"\nThe SILC is an independent state agency which, in cooperation with the California Department of Rehabilitation, prepares and monitors the State Plan for Independent Living.\nThe SILC Mission: To Create Policy and System Change for Independent Living\n releases/ilcs-open-doors-to-independence-for-californians-with-spinal-cord-injuries-300151943.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://ranchofoundation.org/sig.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://ranchofoundation.org/home.html", "http://scrs-ilc.org/assistive-technology.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=SF16596&Transmission_Id=201509301552PR_NEWS_USPR_____SF16596&DateId=20150930", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ilcs-open-doors-to-independence-for-californians-with-spinal-cord-injuries-300151943.html", "http://www.scrs-ilc.org/", "http://www.calsilc.org/"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T06:45:58.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
