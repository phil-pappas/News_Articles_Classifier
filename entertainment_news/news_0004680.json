The thriller aspect of The Principal moves up a gear tonight, and the tension is superb. So is the character development. The murder would have been half as interesting if we hadn’t already been so invested in Tarek (the remarkable Rahel Romahn) and now, as suspicion falls first this way then that, we not only want to find out whodunit, but we’re hoping it’s not one of the many figures we’ve grown attached to. (If it turns out to be the deputy principal, on the other hand, that would be just fine.) Every detail is attended to here: the score is terrific, the framing is beautiful and the dialogue expertly captures the milieu in which it all takes place, including flashes of mordant wit. It’s the complete package.\nMadam Secretary, Ten, 8.40pm \nAdvertisement One of the most intriguing aspects of the opening episode  of season two of Madam Secretary is the light in which Australia is cast. Either showrunner Barbara Hall doesn’t have as good a grasp of Pacific politics as she does of the local scene, or she’s being mischievous. Whatever the case, it’s hard to resist a little cultural-cringy thrill atour mention. Elsewhere, things leap back into gear at a cracking pace and, if some of the plot turns stretch credibility, the great charm and conviction Tea Leoni brings to the central role easily papers over any cracks. Although the churlish part of me wishes the writers hadn’t given her husband, Henry (Tim Daly), his own, obtrusive storyline, it could add considerable interest as the season progresses.\nThe Ex-PM, ABC, 9.05pm \nShaun Micallef’s special magic is his ability to deliver excoriating satire without being unkind. It’s a rare gift he shares with the inimitable John Clarke who, in a double-whammy of bone-dry fun, co-stars with Micallef in this new comedy. As thetitle suggests, Micallef stars as Andrew Dugdale, until recently the leader of our beautiful country and now at a loose end. Distraction arrives in the form of a ghostwriter, Ellen (Lucy Honigman), there to help him complete his memoir. Everything we love about Micallef is here in spades: silliness, slapstick and broad comedy, but also quick repartee and a perfect barrage of clever observations. If you don’t already love Micallef, this is unlikely to convert you, but for his legion of fans, it’s a treat.\nMelinda Houston", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T01:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:47:13.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
