Photo: Andreas Rentz \nThe TV show inspired by the cult 1996 movie  From Dusk Till Dawn  is back for a second season. James Croot quizzed its famous co-creator Robert Rodriguez about what horrors we and his heroes will face this time around.\nWhat can viewers expect from this second season of the show?  \nWe launched this ambitious show right out of the gate – it was a passion project for me and for Quentin (Tarantino) and I knew, the minute I launched the El Rey Network, this franchise would have a home there (in the US at least).  Season one was the day and season two is definitely the night. The first season was about remaking the original film, laying the groundwork for future seasons. Now, all bets are off. It's all about new pairings, new dynamics and new settings but in the end, all of our characters come together to face off against an even greater enemy. This season, the infamous Gecko brothers and all of the rich characters that Quentin created in '96 are unleashed. It's a really great season and I can't wait for people to see it. \nRobert Rodriguez - season one was laying the groundwork for future seasons. Photo: Pascal Le Segretain \nHow early did you have a second season arc mapped out? \nAdvertisement We plan and map things out very far ahead.  A good example is how we treated the mythical destination in the film and TV series – El Rey (which also happens to be the name of our US network). It's this place in Mexico, a Shangri-la where you would go and hide, where gangsters go to retire and live happy. Kind of like the song  Hotel California  – almost like you go there and you can never escape. I was talking with Carlos Coto (the TV show's executive producer and showrunner) last year and asked – \"how soon can the characters get to El Rey?\" and he said \"Oh, that's not until season 5.\" But it's a fluid collaboration between us and the writers. You will have to wait and see.\nHow hard was it to get back into the swing of things? \nIt wasn't hard at all, the first season was such a thrill ride, I think we were all ready to get back into it and start the new chapter. I had a blast directing the first episode of this season, as well as a mind-blowing season finale.\nWhat have you found are the major differences between making a feature film and a TV show? \nTV production traditionally moves very quickly, and I traditionally make films very quickly and efficiently, so for me it was a perfect fit. I love the idea of shooting fast and improvising as you go along, TV really allows for this, but also we have enough time to really dive into characters and watch them evolve through episodes.\nWhat is it about this story that appeal to both you and the audience? \nIt's all about the characters. You can have zombies or vampires, but people really come back for the characters. They fall in love with them and follow them. Also, the themes this season such as destiny, the price of vengeance, personal identity, what is evil all appeal to a universal audience. \nYou've added Danny Trejo and Briana Evigan to the mix this season. Was that a result of them begging you to let them come aboard or did you always have a character in mind for them? \nI always wanted Danny on the show, but there wasn't a character that was specifically written for him. Once we came up with the role of \"The Regulator\" a lightbulb went off in my head, there's no one better for this part than Danny Trejo!! And he was fantastic, his character is a true bad-ass, but what else do you get when you bring in Danny. Briana Evigan is a great addition to the cast this season as well. She gave us the toughness that we wanted without losing sort of that Dusk-y humour all the characters need to have. The character is able to go toe-to-toe with Seth Gecko, and that's not easy for anyone.\nFrom Dusk Till Dawn (season two), FX, Tuesday, 8.30pm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T09:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T12:15:07.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
