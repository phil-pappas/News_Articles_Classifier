Bruce Manuel CHRIS SIKICH CHRIS SIKICH Yes Yes ( Bruce Manuel ) Big Star's Third and T Bone Burnett are among the best bets for Day One (Friday, Oct. 2) of the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. Here are five recommendations. For more information about this free festival, visit www.hardlystrictlybluegrass.com . \nBig Star's Third \nThis might be the most highly anticipated set of the festival -- an all-star tribute to legendary power-pop act Big Star's \"3rd\" album (also known as \"Sister Lovers\"). The cast includes Big Star's own Jody Stephens, Mike Mills of R.E.M. fame and many other talents, performing with a chamber orchestra featuring Kronos Quartet and conducted by Van Dyke Parks. \nDetails: 5:30 p.m. Friday; Arrow Stage \n*** \nT Bone Burnett \nHe's a true Renaissance man, who has earned Grammys, Oscars and the admiration of millions for his production/songwriting work on such soundtracks as \"Crazy Heart,\" \"Cold Mountain\" and, of course, \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" \nHe doesn't perform very often in concert these days, but it sounds like he's got something special cooked up for Hardly Strictly -- even if he isn't sharing many of the details. \n\"I am looking forward to seeing what T Bone has put together,\" says Dawn Holliday, who books the festival. \"I've heard that is going to be quite psychedelic.\" \nDetails: 5:45 p.m. Friday; Swan Stage \n*** \nLee Ann Womack Advertisement \nThe country music vocalist peaked in popularity in the early 2000s, hitting triple-platinum heights with her third studio album, \"I Hope You Dance,\" and winning several big trophies (including a Grammy Award in 2001). \nYet, Womack has done some of her best work in more recent years. Notably, she's earned rave reviews for her most recent outing, \"The Way I'm Livin'.\" \nDetails: 1:15 p.m. Friday; Arrow Stage \n*** \nSister Sparrow and The Dirty Birds \nThe Brooklyn band was amazing at this year's BottleRock Napa Valley festival, more than just holding its own in a lineup that also included Imagine Dragons, No Doubt and Robert Plant. \nThe group is led by Arleigh Kincheloe (aka, Sister Sparrow), who is quite the compelling soul singer. Listen to the cuts \"Sugar\" and \"Untie My Shoelaces\" and you'll get a sense of how high these Dirty Birds can fly. \nDetails: 1:45 p.m. Friday; Swan Stage \n*** \nLaura Marling \nThe critics absolutely adore this U.K. folk singer, who has already seen three of her studio efforts -- 2008's \"Alas, I Cannot Swim,\" 2010's \"I Speak Because I Can\" and 2013's \"Once I Was an Eagle\" -- land nominations for the prestigious Mercury Music Prize (given annually to the best album from the U.K. and Ireland). Don't be surprised if she ends up nabbing a fourth nomination for her latest effort, \"Short Movie.\" \nDetails: 3:20 p.m. Friday; Rooster Stage \nFollow Jim Harrington at http://twitter.com/jimthecritic and www.facebook.com/jim.bayareanews .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:30:21.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
