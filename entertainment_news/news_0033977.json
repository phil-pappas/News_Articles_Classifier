Whether it's on Mars, the other side of the galaxy, behind enemy lines or floating in an ocean, Damon is constantly asking other actors to pull his rear end out of the fire. \nTo be fair, in \"The Martian,\" Damon's Mark Watney does a lot to stay alive. But in the end, he still needs five people to risk their lives to try rescuing him. \nFamiliar? Oh yeah. Consider: \n\"Interstellar\": Damon's Dr. Mann winds up on an alien planet willingly, as part of mankind's grand experiment to colonize another planet before it ruined Earth. He would have died in the wet coffin he shut himself into as a last resort, if not for Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway flying in to rescue him. And how did he repay them? Right. Thanks for nothing, Matt. \n\"Saving Private Ryan\": The title says it all. Tom Hanks and crew wade through enemy territory in World War II to try pulling him out to save his family's bloodline and/or name. And look where it got Hanks, Thanks again, Matt. \n\"The Bourne Identity\": Damon's super assassin Jason Bourne gets tossed into an ocean, causing him to lose his memory and gain a film franchise based on a guy who can't remember why he's such a badass. But if that fishing boat doesn't come to his rescue in the beginning, there's no Jason Bourne. \nContact Tony Hicks at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.TonyHicks or Twitter.com/tonyhicks67 Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:09:39.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
