Before he played that night, he promoted the star-studded concert as he stopped by \" Jimmy Kimmel Live! \" which is filming in Brooklyn this week. During his appearance on the late-night talk show, Hov also had a discussion with host Jimmy Kimmel about why his streaming service is better than its competitors. Later, the rapper surprised the entire audience with free tickets to the Tidal special concert. Making things more special, Hov and Kimmel led the crowd as they walked to the Barclays Center where the show was taking place. The lucky audience got to see performances by Hov himself as well as by Beyonce Knowles , Nicki Minaj , Nick Jonas , Rick Ross , Lil Wayne and more. \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" fans at home who are not subscribed to Tidal which live streamed the event, however, shouldn't feel left out. Hov let Kimmel share with everyone his live rendition of \"Empire State of Mind\" and Usher 's performance of \"Chains\" featuring Nas and Bibi Bourelly. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T12:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:53:03.462+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
