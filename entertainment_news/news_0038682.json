You won't be able to once Adele releases new album 5:01 p.m. Wednesday, Oct. 21, 2015 | Filed in: Things to Do \nMore popular and trending stories FILE - In this Feb. 21, 2012 file photo, performer Adele arrives for the Brit Awards 2012 at the O2 Arena in London. Four years after her last album, the singer appears to have teased British television viewers with a snippet of new music, broadcast during an ad break on prime-time TV. The 30-second ad shown Sunday evening, Oct. 18, 2015, during TV talent show \"The X Factor\" featured Adele's distinctive tones over a black screen on which heartache-filled lyrics appeared. (AP Photo/Jonathan Short, File) \nGreat news! We'll all be crying on the couch with a pint of ice cream while watching \"Love Actually\" and blaring new music from Adele very soon! \nThe soulful songstress tweeted confirmation that we are on the brink of a new album release. Adele said, \"My last record was a break-up record and if I had to label this one I would call it a make-up record. I'm making up with myself.\" \nWait. Making up with yourself? What does that even sound like? For me, its something like, \"Cody, you're better than this! Stop crying in public!\" But for Adele, it sounds like this. \nAdele brought the world to a halt earlier this week when she released a 30-second ad during \"The X Factor\" U.K. The covert commercial instantly made Adele a worldwide trend on Twitter and hinted at what her new album will sound like. \nStill no word from our old friend on exactly when we can expect the album. But rumor has it Adele will release it sometime in November . \nAdele added, \"I'm sorry it took so long, but you know, life happened.\" \nNo apology necessary, boo. I'm not sure I've processed all my emotions you made me feel from the last album. \nThe video includes images from Getty Images.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:49:14.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
