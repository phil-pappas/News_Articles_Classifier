The Disney darling announced the news while promoting her upcoming \" Saturday Night Live \" appearance on \" The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon \" on Thursday night, October 1. \"I'm going to go on tour later this year, me and the Lips,\" Cyrus told host Jimmy Fallon , who then called the group \"badass.\" The tour is launched to support Cyrus and the band's recently-released joint effort \" Miley Cyrus and Her Dead Petz \".
