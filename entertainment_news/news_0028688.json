(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes, File) Sponsored Links The Associated Press LOS ANGELES — \nFor generations, teenage boys got their first look at a naked woman from Playboy, often from a copy swiped from Dad's sock drawer or filched from a newsstand. \nThese days, however, you can see far more explicit photos on your phone than anything Hugh Hefner probably imagined when he launched his pioneering skin magazine 62 years ago with a centerfold of Marilyn Monroe. \nWhich is why, Playboy announced this week, it will stop running nude photos in its U.S. print edition. \n\"You're now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free. And so it's just passé at this juncture,\" Playboy Enterprises CEO Scott Flanders told The New York Times, which first reported the change. \nIn a move Playboy said had the blessing of the 89-year-old Hefner, the magazine will continue to publish what it called \"sexy, seductive pictorials of the world's most beautiful women.\" But those women will presumably have some clothes on. \nIt's the end of an era, many said Tuesday, among them author Gay Talese, who wrote about Playboy and Hefner in his 1981 book about the sexual revolution, \"Thy Neighbor's Wife.\" \n\"Playboy was important enough to be the first magazine in the mainstream that could both be called a literary magazine and a magazine for masturbation,\" he told The Associated Press. \nDuring the magazine's heyday, subscribers could plausibly, if not always convincingly, claim they read it for the articles. \nIt published the work of such writers as John Updike, Jack Kerouac, Ray Bradbury and Joseph Heller and interviewed the likes of Jimmy Carter , Fidel Castro , Malcolm X, Muhammad Ali , Miles Davis, Frank Sinatra and Bob Dylan. \nIt also published nude photos of celebrities such as Drew Barrymore and Daryl Hannah and made stars of Playmates of the Month like Anna Nicole Smith. \nThe magazine that helped trigger the sexual revolution has seen its circulation plunge in recent decades, however, because of some of the very forces it set in motion. \nFirst it had to deal with competition from more sexually explicit magazines like Penthouse and Hustler. Now it's up against the Internet, which is awash in high-definition porn. \nSo beginning in March, Playboy's U.S. print edition will look more like Esquire or GQ, magazines that carry PG-13-type pictures. Its international editions will still contain nude photos. \nPlayboy already took a similar step online more than a year ago. It banned full nudity on its website in August 2014 in a move that made the site safer for people to visit at work. \nThe company said the site saw the number of monthly unique visitors soar 400 percent. At the same time, it said, the median age of visitors fell from 47 to 30, a far more desirable demographic for advertisers. \nOne of the magazine's veteran contributors, celebrity interviewer David Rensin, praised the end of full nudity as something Playboy should have done years ago. \n\"It's a good business move. The magazine's got to keep up with the times,\" said Rensin, whose list of interview subjects includes Bill Gates, Jerry Seinfeld and Martin Scorsese. More recently he interviewed Scarlett Johansson and also Lena Dunham, whom people can see nude simply by watching her TV show \"Girls.\" \nBut for every newsmaker or celebrity who said yes to a Playboy interview, Rensin told the AP on Tuesday, there were others who said no because they didn't want their words to appear close to photographs of naked women. \nOne of those naked women, actress Kristy Swanson, also praised the change, although she added she'll always fondly remember posing nude for her November 2002 pictorial. \n\"I just think that change can be a good thing,\" she said. \nBurlesque queen and former Playboy covergirl Dita Von Teese said she lamented \"the end of Playboy's Golden Age\" when master photographers glorified models and movie stars. \n\"But truthfully, I think it was over a while ago as the (cachet) of posing for Playboy diminished the last several years,\" she said. \nOthers questioned whether the change comes too late to make much difference for the magazine, which has seen circulation fall from 5.6 million in 1975 to about 800,000 today, according to the Times, which cited the Alliance for Audited Media. \n\"The perception of what Playboy is is never going to change,\" said Samir Husni, director of the Magazine Innovation Center at the University of Mississippi's Meek School of Journalism in Oxford. \n\"What's hurting Playboy today is, one, its name,\" he continued. \"What gentleman today wants to consider himself a Playboy? And the competition. I mean, GQ is doing such a great job and Esquire is doing such a great job, so for men who want that combination of fun and real good solid content, they go elsewhere.\" \n___ \nAssociated Press Writers Leanne Italie in New York and Robert Jablon in Los Angeles contributed to this story.
