And yet, the Falcons still came away with a win over the woeful Redskins. Ryan had no touchdowns for the first time this year, and his 57.1 completion percentage was his lowest since Week 6 of last season. \nRyan has been fairly reliable throughout his career in terms of taking care of the football and having a high completion percentage. He’s averaged over 28 touchdown passes per season since 2010 and has been consistent with his accuracy. \nRyan just barely saved Peyton Manning from making a repeat appearance on this list, and a big reason for that was the questionable overruling of what would have been a 13-yard touchdown pass to Devonta Freeman with 51 seconds left. Freeman rushed for a touchdown two plays later, and the Falcons went on to win in overtime after Kirk Cousins threw a pick-six to Robert Alford. All-Bust RB1: Ameer Abdullah \nProjected points (position rank): 11.0 (14th) \nActual points (position rank): 0.6 (T-65th) \nSunday was another awful day in what’s been a truly awful season for the Lions. The NFL’s lone winless team was blown out by the Cardinals, and the talented rookie Abdullah had some issues holding onto the football, with two fumbles on the day. \nAbdullah was benched in favor of fellow rookie running back Zach Zenner for much of the second half following his two first half fumbles. Abdullah finished with seven touches on offense, tied for his lowest of the season. This marks his second appearance on the All-Bust lineup, which makes his stellar debut seem more and more like an outlier. All-Bust RB2: Jamaal Charles \nProjected points (position rank): 18.6 (1st) \nActual points (position rank): 8.4 (26th) \nThings couldn’t have gone much worse for Kansas City on Sunday. The Chiefs lost their fourth game in a row, this time to the lowly Bears at home, and Charles suffered what is believed to be a torn ACL in his right knee during the third quarter. \nThis would be the second season-ending injury for Charles, who tore his left ACL in Week 2 of the 2011 season. This is a crushing blow for the Chiefs, who have little experience on the roster to replace the three-time All-Pro selection. Knile Davis has averaged just 3.4 yards per carry in his career and Charcandrick West has just five total carries under his belt as a pro. \nFantasy owners who used a top-three pick for Charles are now left scrambling for replacements in a very thin crop of free agent running backs. All-Bust WR1: Randall Cobb \nProjected points (position rank): 11.8 (6th) \nActual points (position rank): 2.3 (T-62nd) \nCobb makes his second consecutive appearance on the All-Bust lineup thanks to his season-worst 23-yard performance. For the second time this season (and first since Week 1), Cobb did not lead the team in targets, though he still maintains a sizable lead as Aaron Rodgers’ go-to option in the red zone. \nDespite the presence of James Jones, Davante Adams and Ty Montgomery, Cobb owners should still feel comfortable with him in the starting lineup. The Packers will continue to throw the ball plenty with Rodgers calling the shots, and Cobb will get his touches. All-Bust WR2: Percy Harvin \nProjected points (position rank): 7.4 (30th) \nActual points (position rank): -0.1 (N/A) \nThere were several options for the second wide receiver spot on the All-Bust team, but Harvin’s inability to gain positive yardage during the entire course of a 60-minute football game earned him the nod. \nWith both Sammy Watkins and LeSean McCoy inactive for the second straight week, it seemed like Harvin would play a bigger role in the offense. He lost a yard on his lone rushing attempt, and while he was targeted a team-high four times, he finished with zero catches. \nAmazingly, Harvin is owned in 61 percent of leagues, though that number might drop after this week. Even more amazingly is the fact that Harvin leads all Bills wide receivers in targets, with nearly double the amount that Robert Woods has on the season. All-Bust TE: Jason Witten \nProjected points (position rank): 8.2 (3rd) \nActual points (position rank): 1.3 (27th) \nThe Cowboys offense was no match against the Patriots defense on Sunday, and Witten had his worst performance of the season. He had a season low 33 receiving yards and lost a fumble for the first time since 2010. \nWitten is averaging just nine yards per catch this season, the lowest season average for his career. Last season, he finished with 703 yards, his lowest total since his rookie year. Perhaps it’s finally time the trusty veteran starts to experience a decline. All-Bust Flex: Eddie Lacy \nProjected points (position rank): 13.7 (7th) \nActual points (position rank): 3.5 (44th) \nFew players have disappointed more this season than Lacy. After rewarding owners with a strong debut against the Bears, Lacy has just 224 yards from scrimmage in his past four games with no touchdowns. In his third NFL season, he’s seen his average rush attempts and yards per game decrease each year. \nLacy has yet to have a run of longer than 16 yards this season, and with James Starks seeing virtually the same number of touches on offense so far (70 touches for Lacy vs. 63 for Starks), Lacy fantasy owners can feel free to hit the panic button if they haven’t already. All-Bust D/ST: Texans \nProjected points (position rank): 8.7 (14th) \nActual points (position rank): 0.0 (23rd) \nFor the second straight week, the Texans defense finds itself on the All-Bust lineup. \nLed by the incomparable J.J. Watt, Houston was supposed to have a strong defense this year, but that has not been the case so far. The 10th-highest owned defense seemed to have a favorable matchup on Thursday night against the Colts and 40-year-old Matt Hasselbeck, but instead the team put up a goose egg, allowing 27 points and forcing no turnovers. \nThe Texans face the Jaguars, Dolphins and Titans in their next three games, all of which should be good matchups for the defense. But after two straight awful performances, fantasy owners shouldn’t feel too comfortable slotting Houston in their starting lineups. All-Bust K: Dan Carpenter \nProjected points (position rank): 7.0 (26th) \nActual points (position rank): 2.0 (26th) \nIn a 14-13 win over the Titans, the Bills did not attempt a single field goal, so Carpenter really isn’t to blame for his two-point performance. He did his part, making both of his extra point attempts. He’s owned in 67 percent of leagues despite having just seven field goal attempts on the season. Final Tally: All-Bust Lineup \nHere’s the final recap of the most disappointing lineup from Week 5 of the 2015 NFL season: \nMatt Ryan: 8.2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:32:06.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
