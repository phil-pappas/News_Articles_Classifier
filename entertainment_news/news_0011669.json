ACT Artistic Director Carey Perloff plans to announce Wednesday, Oct. 21, that Irwin, who’s appeared frequently with the company, will be in residency for the performances, two master classes with ACT master of fine arts students and three Studio ACT classes in the public adult training program.\nIrwin’s “On Beckett,” which he’ll perform at ACT’s Strand Theater, combines excerpts from Beckett’s plays, prose and poetry — and a bit of soft-shoe shuffle — with the performer’s musings gleaned from working inside the great playwright’s words. Irwin has a long history with Beckett, including his own two stage adaptations of Beckett’s “Texts for Nothing” (off-Broadway and at ACT), “Endgame” at ACT in 2012 and two famed New York appearances in “Waiting for Godot” — with Steve Martin and Robin Williams in 1988 and opposite Nathan Lane in 2009.\nTickets go on sale Wednesday, Oct. 21, at (415) 749-2228, www.act-sf.org . Information on classes is available at www.act-sf.org/studio.\n— Robert Hurwitt", "external_links": ["http://www.act-sf.org/", "http://www.act-sf/studio.org", "http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-10-21T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:57:11.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
