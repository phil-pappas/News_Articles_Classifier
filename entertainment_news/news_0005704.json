The book then helps readers build on those goals and make their aspirations a reality.\n“The Complete Golfer” is unique in that it is presented in a workbook format. It is interactive and lets readers take note, write and answer questions related to them and golf. The author’s extensive experience as a coach and teacher is one of the things that make this book engaging and interactive.\n“I want to share my knowledge and passion in a way that is easy for golfers from any level to digest and understand yet still challenge them,” Meyer says. “One of my greatest assets is in understanding how people learn. This has given me the knowledge in how to adapt, modify, and approach each individual golf student based on their learning style, interest, and ability.”\nUseful for beginners and accomplished players, this book is a compelling guide into the world of golf and for becoming “The Complete Golfer.”\n“The Complete Golfer”\nBy Paul Meyer\nSoftcover | 6 x 9in | 128 pages | ISBN 9781504927697\nE-Book | 128 pages | ISBN 9781504927680\nPaul Meyer has been a professional golf instructor for the past 16 years and a Wisconsin high school golf coach for 17 years.
