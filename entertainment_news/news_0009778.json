Talcott is a printmaker, illustrator and owner of Studio 80, a printmaking studio near Boston. She teaches relief printmaking techniques and has shown her work in various group shows both in the Boston area and nationally; and is included in the collections of many corporations as well as the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. \nDuring a short residency at Waterfall Arts this summer, Talcott found inspiration in the large shapes and forms at the Front Street Shipyard and made a series of woodcuts shown in the Corridor show. She said her work reflects her interest in the natural world and its intersection with the man-made world. \n“ I like to observe natural and man-made patterns, pull them apart, and then re-imagine them as printed pieces,” she said. \nUsing linoleum and woodblock prints, she said she produces a vocabulary of images and then works intuitively to collage them back together into new forms. \n“I alternate between abstraction and representational images, with a palette of color or black and white to weave images together that strive to express the vitality of growth and decay in a physical and spiritual world,” she said. \nThe following day — Thursday, Oct. 22 — Talcott will give a demonstration of her woodcut printing techniques during the monthly Free Demo and Open Printmaking Studio at Waterfall Arts, from 5:30 to 8 p.m. She will start the demo early on; afterwards, there will be plenty of time to experiment and make prints. The demo and open studio time are free and open to all levels; as space is limited, call 338-2222 to reserve a slot. \nTalcott’s work can be seen through Nov. 25. Waterfall Arts gallery hours are Tuesdays through Fridays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and by appointment; to arrange, call 338-2222. The exhibit and talk are supported by Coyote Moon, the Belfast Coop and yearlong business sponsor, Revision Energy. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
