Photo: Liz Sheehan \nThe sun is shining and there's a light warm breeze blowing that lets us know that summer is right around the corner. It's the perfect morning to forgo the cardy, chuck on a pair of thongs and head to the coast for breakfast.\nCottesloe would usually be my go to on such a glorious morning but it was time I stopped overlooking Cott's northern rival - Scarborough.\nUntil the last few years, the strip along Scarborough beach has been kind of stuck in the 90s. Then some new cafes opened selling things like green smoothies and chia puddings, the Rendezvous underwent a revamp and it no longer felt like a place you were going to get glassed on a Saturday night.\nSandbar has a prime pozzie across the road from the beach at Scarborough. Photo: Liz Sheehan \nThe Sandbar sits in a prime possie right on the corner, only a stone's throw from those famous turquoise waves. There's a heap of outside tables that will be filled with tanned legs and bare feet dangling off the colourful bar stools during the summer. Inside, recycled pallet furniture and colourful cushions let you know this place wants to you kick back and not worry about the sand on your feet.\nAdvertisement The menu has some \"kool\" names for fairly run of the mill breakfast dishes. Having a more traditional breakfast menu isn't a bad thing. \nThere is no worrying about whether some of the more inventive breakfast dishes will be to someone's liking. It's a great place to take the family or if you really just want a traditional big breakfast after a swim or surf. Prices top out at $23 for the \"Scarboro Surf Club Brekky\" -  eggs, bacon, sausage, beans, roasted tomato and sauteed mushrooms on toast.\nThe Kool Korner Crepes ($15), served with roasted coconut flakes and maple syrup. Photo: Liz Sheehan \nThe coffee here is from Dimattina and it pains me to say this, but it wasn't great. It was overheated, making it bitter and watery. The Nespresso I had before leaving home was a better coffee than this.\nIt was the kind of balmy morning that called for an ice cold milkshake ($6.50). Except, what Andy got was just a chocolate flavoured frothy milk that was barely a step up from buying a Choc Chill and shaking the carton hoping it would bring all the boys to yard. Can we all just agree that a milkshake needs a scoop of ice-cream mixed in it please? \nTHAT'S what brings all the boys.\n\"The Kool Korner Crepes\" ($15), served with roasted coconut flakes and maple syrup came with a choice of strawberries or banana. Even though strawberries are in season, I can't pass on the opportunity to have banana with crepes. Made from buckwheat, these crepes were a great little gluten free sweet brekky. Despite having lashings of coconut flakes showered on top, the flavour was a little ho-hum. There wasn't anything wrong with the dish per se, but it was lacking that certain something. \nI can't get my head around seafood at breakfast but my darling husband Andy was drawn to the offer of smoked salmon on the Sandbar eggs ($18). Served as poached eggs on a potato rosti with fresh spinach and hollandaise, this bright coloured breakfast had everything going for it. \nThe hollandaise was thick and buttery with a touch of tang - in other words - perfect. A thick slice of potato rosti looked like it would be bland and \"stick in the mouth\" stodgy but was surprisingly light, fluffy and seasoned well.  The generous serving of bright smoked salmon made this dish great value for money with the poached eggs giving way to a satisfying pop when cut with the knife. Fresh spinach added crunch and texture but was there was a little too much of it on an already heaving yet satisfying dish.\nThe staff here are attentive and super friendly. How can they not be smiling when they work across the road from the beautiful Scarborough beach? It's refreshing to be served by people who actually seem happy to be working.\nIf you're after a breakfast that is more on the traditional side, then this place could be just the ticket.  Its location really gives it another dimension, otherwise I think it would be just another restaurant serving breakfast. Anyway... as they say at The Sandbar - \"Life is better at the beach\".\n1 Scarborough Beach Road, Scarborough\nBreakfast served 7am - 11.30am every day \n  Follow WAtoday on Twitter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:16:38.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
