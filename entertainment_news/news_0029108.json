These genomic differences, many of which affected genes, include deletions (loss of DNA), insertions (added DNA), and duplications (extra DNA copies).\nThe researchers created a map of eight classes of structural variants that potentially contribute to disease.\nFirst Published on October 01, 2015 9:00 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:22:28.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
