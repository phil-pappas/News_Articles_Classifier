So says Robert Lindsay who plays Rupert Bull, a rather camp antiques dealer who wears chequered suits and fuschia ties and handkerchiefs. He is assisted in the shop by his sister who’s played by Maureen Lipman, though she rarely “assists”, preferring to chain smoke and read a scandalous celebrity magazine called That’s A Shame!\nInto their chaotic shop comes Faye, a nice sensible new girl, whose first role is to carefully clean and restore an exquisite collection of Faberge eggs, for which she’s told to “pop out and get some washing up liquid”.\nThe often silly script, broad jokes, and people crashing into delicate antiques are all boosted, though, by a great guest appearance from Matt Lucas.\nShare article\nThis is a new comedy series though it’s only “new” in that it begins tonight. Otherwise it seems like something straight from Saturday nights in the 70s or 80s but for that reason, and despite its corny jokes and laughter track, it’s oddly comforting and innocent. Perhaps the writers were indeed trying to make it retro, and capture the flavour of comedies from another era, but I just found it sweet and cosy.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-22T00:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:03:38.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
