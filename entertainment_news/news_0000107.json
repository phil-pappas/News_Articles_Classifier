Neither is a sequel or is based on a comic book, achievements worth noting in 2015. Each represents a considerable gamble that is based in large part on the complete track record of the director, not the recent past. And each shows that studios still believe in the power of the director as much or more than the actors or the FX department to deliver a product that audiences want to see. \n\"The Martian\" is more of a sure bet: an easy-to-digest concept (astronaut is marooned on Mars, survives by his wits) with a bankable star (Matt Damon) and a director who knows his way around a space shuttle (Scott, whose credits include \"Alien\" and \"Prometheus\"). It's title is self-explanatory, except for confusion about whether Damon is an alien or an astronaut, something the poster, marketing campaign and trailer try to make as clear as possible. (He's wearing a helmet and a space suit -- he's an astronaut.) \nBut Scott's movies aren't reliable moneymakers, at least not domestically. \"Exodus: Gods and Kings\" made a little more than $65 million in the U.S., according to Box Office Mojo. \"The Counselor\" did a little less than $17 million, \"Body of Lies\" less than $40 million and \"A Good Year\" less than $8 million. It's fair to say that Scott and his frequent star, Russell Crowe, took a long fall together from the heights of \"Gladiator\" to the depths of \"A Good Year,\" a $35 million movie that made less than one-third of its production budget. \nBut if Scott's movies are no longer guaranteed hits in the U.S., he's still a force in the increasingly important international market. \"Promentheus\" was a smash overseas and made 69 percent of its money overseas. \"Exodus: Gods and Kings\" did even better: 76 percent of its box office came outside the U.S. Along with \"Robin Hood,\" three of Scott's five biggest worldwide hits have come in the last five years. Not bad for a 77-year-old director who's supposedly lost his touch. \nOnscreen, Scott's elaborate production design and attention to detail is as sharp as ever in \"The Martian.\" Mars looks amazing, credit shared among Scott, cinematographer Daruisz Wolski, and production designer Arthur Max. There are plenty of sweeping shots that prove Scott came of age before the video generation and knows how to fill a frame. The kind of confusing storyline that sank \"Prometheus\" is no problem here: Damon is stuck on Mars and he works like a busy astro-bee while the heroes back at NASA figure out how to save him. It's not as scary as \"Alien\" or as gorgeous as \"Blade Runner,\" but it works. \n\"The Walk\" is a harder sell. The World Trade Center towers are known to all, for all the wrong reasons, and while Philippe Petit's wirewalk between in 1974 is an incredible true story that humanized what were two huge ugly buildings, it has several problems: \n(1) It's been told before, and brilliantly. \"Man on Wire,\" the 2008 documentary about how Petit did it, is stunning, an Oscar winner and an instant classic. It's impossible to watch without being enthralled and moved. Any comparison to it is going to come up short. \n(2) Petit is short and French and temperamental. A complicated, not a clear-cut, hero. He did break \"about a hundred different laws\" as one cop yells to him. The physical skills required to play him are challenging, and then there's the accent. \n(3) Is this a biopic, a caper movie, a triumph of the spirit, or what? How do you handle the stunts? And the facts that these towers aren't there anymore? What does \"The Walk\" mean? What walk? The title sounds boring. \nZemeckis is 63, a spring chicken compared to Scott, but not a surefire hitmaker either. He's made some of the most popular and beloved movies ever -- \"Forrest Gump,\" \"Back to the Future,\" \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\" \"Cast Away\" -- and is revered as a technical innovator. But Zemeckis doesn't have the brand identity of Spielberg or Scorsese and has fallen short of blockbuster status with his last three movies: \"Flight,\" \"A Christmas Carol\" and \"Beowulf.\" He's not automatically bankable and neither is the star of \"The Walk,\" Joseph Gordon-Levitt, a talented actor but not box-office gold. \nWith \"The Walk,\" Zemeckis has made two movies in one. The first is a Disneyfied version of Petit's coming-of-age in France, full of cliches and bright color and devoid of imagination. The 3D effects are by-the-numbers. It's boring. \nThe last 45 minutes are something altogether different. Once Petit and his pals get to Manhattan and start planning the walk, the movie picks up speed. Once he gets on the wire, it soars. Zemeckis takes his time, sets up and frames the shots (Wolski again) and uses the 3D camera in a revelatory way. Gordon-Levitt handles the physical stuff beautifully, and the voiceover narration goes from annoying to transfixing. It's a serene, spine-tingling experience, unlike anything Zemeckis has done. Well, the storm and the dialogue-free chunk of \"Cast Away\" was pretty special too. \nScott is one of the oldest directors still active in Hollywood. (Clint Eastwood, Roman Polanski and Woody Allen are older, the latter two outside the studio system.) Zemeckis is part of an older middle age that includes James Cameron, Kathryn Bigelow, Gus Van Sant, and at the far end, his mentor Steven Spielberg. Scott has a long list of announced projects; Zemeckis has one \"Untitled WWII Romantic Thriller.\" Maybe it's a rewrite of \"Romancing the Stone,\" with a wartime element. That might get financing -- with the right leads. \n-- Jeff Baker", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T15:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:39:45.819+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
