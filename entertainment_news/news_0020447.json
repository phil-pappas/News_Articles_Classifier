It's going to be a symbolic night where everyone who's helped me with this is going to be in one room.\" \nMeanwhile, it seems Ed has been busy using his celebrity status to help out members of the community recently as he was handed an honorary degree last week in recognition of his \"outstanding career in music.\" \nThe 'Bloodstream' hitmaker - who was awarded the doctorate by University Campus Suffolk in Ipswich, near his hometown of Framlingham - was asked to speak at the ceremony and encouraged young people to \"chill\" more. \nHe said: \"I know that's a weird thing to say when coming to receive a doctorate but I think there's a lot of pressure on kids to go to university, then a lot of them end up in debt with a degree they didn't really need to get the job they want.\" \nHe added: \"We should be encouraging kids to chill a bit more. You don't have to go to university at 18, you can go off and travel for a year.\" bang showbiz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:37:52.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
