Wierzynski says the band is hoping to learn a thing or two from Aussie audiences. \n\"We hear that the Australians are a rowdy bunch. We look forwarding to experiencing an Aussie party and learning some Australian dance moves,\" he said. \nBetween performances Wierzynski says outdoor adventures, drinking with locals, kangaroo fights and avoiding lethal wildlife will be on the agenda. \n\"We have played everything from barn parties to clubs to all kinds of festivals.\" \nLoren Kate Australian singer songfwriter Loren Kate. Contributed \nOFF the back of her impressive Telstra Road to Discovery win last year, Loren Kate presents her new single, When You Leave and EP, Til The Night Meets The Sun, released last week. \nThe first single, When You Leave, is a heartfelt folk country tune with a warm Australiana feel written for Loren's ex-partner, who passed away two years ago. \n\"On the way to the hospital to say my last goodbye, this song started writing itself. I was trying to find the words to say, but what can you say to someone who's about to pass away? I just wanted him to feel my love, and take it with him.\" \nRon Sexsmith \nCANADIAN singer-songwriter Ron Sexsmith will be touring Australia with his band in November for the first time in six years. \nHaving released his 14th studio album Carousel One to rave reviews in March, Ron's shows will be eagerly anticipated by fans of dynamic performance and spine chilling vocals. \nRon Sexsmith is a major contemporary writer/artist who has collated a sizeable and consistently captivating body of work since releasing his self-titled major label debut in 1995. \nRobert Forster \nROBERT Forster recently released I Love Myself And Always Have, a new instant hit from his solo album Songs To Play, released last month. \nI Love Myself And Always Have is a track about the rollicking journey of self-acceptance and finally coming to a place of being comfortable with your own beat. \nThe lyrics paint the picture of the internal battle: \n\"What I could and couldn't do, What I could and couldn't achieve, A lap of honour a time to leave, I march to my own beat, with a banner in the street\". \n\nTrinity Roots \nLEGENDARY soul/reggae band Trinity Roots spearhead the Kiwi contingent. \nRegarded by many as the spiritual keeper of the NZ sound, Trinity Roots frontman Warren Maxwell was a driving force in Fat Freddy's Drop and also heads up acclaimed band Little Bushmen. \nThey are joined by Cornerstone Roots and the next generation of NZ artists - Thomas Oliver and Estere. \nAlthough associated with New Zealand reggae they also embody a stripped back, jazz and soul-influenced rhythmic sound, which often builds up drum- and guitar-led crescendos. \nWe Two Thieves \nEQUAL parts Americana, folk, gospel and soul, We Two Thieves present a heartfelt musical peppered with tales of mischievous lovers, broken hearts, tender rebels and an undaunted celebration of the treasures of life. \nThe ultimate collaboration between two unique singer-songwriters, We Two Thieves is the combined force of Emily Lubitz (Tinpan Orange) and Mama Kin, bringing to the stage transcendent vocal harmonies that elevate the grace and power of two of Australia's most engaging songbirds. \nUnleashing a sound that marks a new frontier for both artists, We Two Thieves' tales were written and rehearsed around a well-scrubbed kitchen table at the start of a hot summer. Figs were eaten from the garden; chickens, dogs and a pride of children romped about. mullumbimby", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:52:28.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
