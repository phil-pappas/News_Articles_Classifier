Enlarge Don’t get it twisted: “Empire” actress Taraji P. Henson said there's no comparing the talent of actors and reality stars.\n\"These kids are thinking they can do reality TV and come and do this craft that I studied, sweated and grinded,\" she said in the November issue of Essence magazine.\n\"People forget it's a craft because it's so pop now...Can they make me believe the words coming out of their mouth?\"\nThe star, who graduated with a degree in theater arts from Howard University, has appeared in the critically acclaimed films \"Baby Boy,\" \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,\" \"Think Like A Man,\" and \"Hustle and Flow\" (with her \"Empire” co-star Terrence Howard).\nOn the Fox television drama, she stars as Cookie Lyon, the family matriarch and an ex-con whose loud personality matches her stylish designer outfits.\nDennis Leupold for Essence Magazine \"I've always said I want to do the type of work that people study,\" Henson says in Essence. \"Empire\" was the breakout hit of last season: The show had progressively higher ratings during each of its 11 weeks, culminating in a season finale that drew 17 million watchers. Similarly, its second season debut had 22 million viewers.\nHenson’s grateful for the exposure.\n\"Even though people are just now finding me as Cookie, thank God for Netflix because people are so moved by my performance they're like, 'Where has she been?' I've always said I want to do the type of work that people study.\"\nmhood@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories ‘Empire’ Season 2, Episode 3 Recap: ‘Fires of Heaven’ 'Empire' Season 2, Episode 2 Recap: 'Without a Country' Greatest dropped TV plotlines Tags: taraji p. henson , empire , interviews", "external_links": ["http://www.essence.com/2015/10/13/taraji-p-henson-owns-november-cover-essence-magazine"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:28:28.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
