Excerpts follow... \nWhat’s the film all about? \nIt is an emotional comedy. Nayanthara plays the daughter of a cop. She has completed her studies and is on the verge of taking up a job. Vijay Sethupathi plays a wannabe rowdy whose mom is also a cop. Interestingly, Parthepan plays the baddie in this film. \nWhat about rumours that Nayanthara plays a hearing and speech impaired person in this film? \nNayanthara’s character can speak but can’t hear. If you observe people who have been in places where there have been bomb blasts, they have trouble hearing you, but can speak through lip-reading. To study her character, we gave her videos of people whose ear drums have been affected by loud sounds, but who could speak. She watched those videos to enhance her performance. \nHas Nayanthara dubbed in her own voice in the film? \nThat is true. This particular role demanded a certain time lag and a dubbing artiste would have found it difficult to implement it. That is why we thought that it would be best if she dubbed herself. Nayanthara was absolutely professional. For certain scenes in which her character is to shed tears and speak, she insisted on having glycerine and shed tears even while dubbing. \nBoth the lead characters are the wards of police officers. Why? \nI come from a family of cops. My dad, who is no more, was a cop and my mom too is a police officer. I know how children in such families feel. That’s my inspiration for the film.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:31:12.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
