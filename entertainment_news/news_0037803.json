Under scheme rules revised last year, qualifying television animation and children’s drama projects are eligible for rebates of up to 40% on qualifying NZ production expenditure. These are the only genres that can also apply for NZ On Air funding. These genres have high cultural value and access to the grant means more content can be produced. \nNZ companies Whitebait Media and animation partner Toonz will be making the series for NZ children but with potential for international sales. \nAlso for our youngest viewers The Moe Show returns, as Moe continues to solve everyday problems wth the help of his friends. \nFor older child audiences the afternoon magazine show Sticky TV will return for its 15th season while the classic kiwi kids show What Now - one of NZ’s longest running programmes - celebrates 35 years in 2016. The animated The Barefoot Bandits will return with a second series continuing the adventures of Tane, Riley and Fridge on the fictional island of Ngaro. \nAlso back is a rebranded daily afternoon show for teens, The Adam And Eve Show, previously The 4.30 show. \n\"We are currently reviewing our Children’s funding strategy to ensure we are keeping pace with the demands of this very mobile audience. We anticipate making changes in the 2016/17 year,\" said NZ On Air Chief Executive Jane Wrightson. \"Children are still very well served by television but are also increasingly accessing content online via a range of devices.\" \nIn recent days NZ On Air has also announced funding for four digital projects for children and young people from the Digital Media Innovation Fund and three webseries for child and teen audiences. \nMore information on the Children’s strategy review is available at www.nzonair.govt.nz/publications \nFunding details \nWhat Now 2016, 40 x 2hrs, Whitebait Productions for TV2, $3,189,000 \nThe Adam And Eve Show, 200 x ½ hr, Whitebait Productions for TV2, $3,080,400 \nSticky TV 2016, 264 x 35 mins, Pickled Possum Productions for FOUR, $2,374,290 \nThe Moe Show 3, 26 x ½ hr, Pop-Up Workshop for FOUR, $2,202,214 \nDarwin And Newts, 40 x 11mins, Whitebait Media for TV2, $1,523,177 \nThe Barefoot Bandits 2, 10 x ½ hr, Mukpuddy Animation for TV2, $869,054 \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
