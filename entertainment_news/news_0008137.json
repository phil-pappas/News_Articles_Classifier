(Photo: LEWIS WHYLD, AFP/Getty Images)\nIt will be Kate's first appearance at royal state banquet since she married Prince William in 2011. And they don't get much more formal than a royal state banquet, where some 170 guests, all dressed to the nines, gather around a horseshoe-shaped table in the palace ballroom to eat, toast and chat up whoever is visiting for the purposes of maintaining affable relations between Britain and foreign nations.\nLike a White House state dinner, everything about a royal state banquet, from the food and drink to the exact-placement-to-the-inch of the plates, glasses, cutlery and table centerpieces — is controlled with obsessive detail by palace minions led by the queen herself.\nAnd that includes the dress code: Evening gowns, family jewels, gloves and glittery headgear are required.\nIn other words, it's a really big deal. If you want to see what happens at state banquets, there's a video of the one the queen hosted for Qatar at Windsor Castle in 2010.\nRoyal fans , meanwhile, can't wait to see what Kate wears on her glossy locks and on her slender post-pregnancy body.\nFinally we'll see Catherine wearing a tiara!!\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will attend the State Banquet... http://t.co/xBZHc2i69s\n— The Dutchess Kate (@kate_Daily) August 16, 2015 They're also hoping to see whether the queen has presented her granddaughter-in-law with the Elizabeth II family order, a jewel-encased image of the queen on a ribbon typically worn pinned to the gowns of royal women. Kate's stepmother-in-law, Camilla Duchess of Cornwall, has already been presented with hers.\nDuchess Kate wore a tiara borrowed from the queen to the annual diplomatic reception at Buckingham Palace in December 2013. (Photo: Jesal / Tanna / Splash News)\nSome in the British media have been busy examining all of Kate's tiara options : Will she borrow one from the queen, as she did when she wore the Cartier Halo Tiara to her wedding? Or will she wear one her husband inherited from his late mother, Princess Diana, such as the Spencer Tiara family heirloom that Diana wore to her wedding in 1981?\nHello magazine helpfully provided a photo gallery of top royal tiaras from which Kate could choose.\nKate has worn tiaras in public only twice before: Besides her wedding, she wore the Papyrus Tiara, which belonged to the queen's late sister and late mother, at the annual diplomatic reception at the palace in 2013.\nThe Spectre premiere is set for the evening of Oct. 26 at the Royal Albert Hall. She doesn't have to wear a tiara to a premiere but evening gowns are the usual dress code.\nNow that her maternity leave is over, Kate's engagement book is filling up. She is scheduled to attend three events connected to the young royals' charities, including a formal gala for The Art Room, on Oct. 26 and 27.\nPrince William, who also has a regular job as a pilot for an air ambulance service, also has a busy schedule, including a speech on Oct. 19 on Chinese television about the urgent need to combat the illegal wildlife trade. The speech will be filmed at the Maughan Library at King's College London before being aired on CCTV, the station with the largest audience in China.\nDuchess Kate of Cambridge is back to work after a few months off for maternity leave following the birth and christening of her second baby, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge. She is as slender as ever and just as stylish, as these pictures show. Luke MacGregor, AFP/Getty Images Fullscreen A little over a month after Charlotte's birth in May, Kate appeared with the royal family on the balcony of Buckingham Palace for the annual Trooping The Colour ceremony on June 13, 2015. She wore an ice blue-and-ivory floral silk coatdress by Catherine Walker, topped with an ivory round hat with a curled feather, according to the blogs that track her style. Chris Jackson, Getty Images Fullscreen For Princess Charlotte's christening on July 5, 2015, the family walked to the church at Sandringham in front of crowds of fans and media. Kate wore wore a creamy white coat dress, custom-made by the Alexander McQueen label, with a wide flaring collar neckline and a matching hat.

Julian Finney, Getty Images Fullscreen Later in July, she and Prince William went to Portsmouth to visit the headquarters of Britain's team for the America's Cup World Series event. Both royals wore navy blue Ben Ainslie Racing pullovers by sailing outfitter Henri Lloyd, and Kate's skinny jeans showed off her figure. Ian Vogler, Getty Images, WPA Pool, Fullscreen She was out of sight for all of August but in mid-September she was back to her royal duties, visiting the Anna Freud Centre in London on September 17, 2015, to highlight her patronage of a charity that treats children and young people with mental health problems. It was her first solo engagement since the birth of Charlotte, and she showed off her new side bangs for the occasion. Chris Jackson, AFP/Getty Images Fullscreen She wore a checked shirt dress by Ralph Lauren for the visit to the Anna Freud Centre. Chris Jackson, Gettyh Images, AP Fullscreen For the first time ever, a young royal paid a visit to a women's prison in near Woking, England, on Sept. 25, 2015. It was part of her patronage of anti-addiction efforts, especially those aimed at helping prisoners addicted to drugs and alcohol. Kirsty Wigglesworth, AP Fullscreen She met with inmates, such as Isha Walker, in the Rehabilitation of Addicted Prisoners Trust (RAPT) program, during her visit. Kirsty Wigglesworth, AFP/Getty Images Fullscreen Her visit to the prison was not announced in advance but it was covered by the media nonetheless. She wore a winter-white tweed dress, with a peplum waist, by London-based label The Fold, according to the blogs that track her fashion. Kirsty Wigglesworth, AP Fullscreen She turned up with Prince William and Prince Harry for the opening ceremony of the Rugby World Cup 2016 at Twickenham Stadium on September 18, 2015 in London. She stood out in an electric blue Emile coat by Reiss. Karwai Tang, WireImage Fullscreen Even in a stadium filled with 88,000 screaming rugby fans, she really stood out in her blue Reiss coat. Karwai Tang, WireImage Fullscreen Later, she attended the England v Wales match during the Rugby World Cup 2015 on September 26, 2015. She and William, who displayed a lot of PDA during the game, rooted for Wales while Harry rooted for England. Wales won. Karwai Tang, WireImage Fullscreen Kate actually wore slacks to the Wales v England match, a pair of Zara’s black-and-white floral print pants with a black top and a bright red scarf. Notice that Harry looks glum. Karwai Tang, WireImage Fullscreen Will and Kate showed at the match that more than four years after their wedding, and a dozen years since they met, the royal couple are still as close as ever. Karwai Tang, WireImage Fullscreen Both Will and Kate have made mental-health awareness a focus of their patronage, so they both appeared at an event to mark World Mental Health Day on October 10, 2015. They met with young people to talk about their battles with the stigma against mental-health disorders, especially for children. Arthur Edwards, AFP/Getty Images Fullscreen For this engagement, Kate chose her Tory Burch Paulina knit dress, a frock she made famous in New Zealand in 2014 when she wore it to Prince George's first-ever public appearance during a playdate with Kiwi kiddies in Wellington in April 2014. ARTHUR EDWARDS, AFP/Getty Images Fullscreen Kate usually dives right in at her engagements. In this case, she sat down to talk with young people dealing with mental-health issues and now volunteer with the anti-stigma campaign Time to Change or Mind, at Harrow College in Middlesex, England, on Oct. 10. Arthur Edwards, AP Fullscreen After the mental-health engagement, the couple watched the Australia v Wales match during the Rugby World Cup 2015 at Twickenham Stadium in London. Kate wore her Reiss Delaney flared coat over a black turtleneck sweater and a dark-red scarf thrown around her neck. Karwai Tang, WireImage Fullscreen Kate showed her passion for rugby during the match, cheering, leaping to her feet, covering her face, peeking through her fingers, as the play progressed. Karwai Tang, WireImage Fullscreen Naturally, Will and Kate cheered for Wales during the match with Australia, but the Aussies won 15-6. Karwai Tang, WireImage Fullscreen Like this topic?
