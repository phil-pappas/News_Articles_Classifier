It is told from the point of view of a woman in her early 70s looking back at seven crucial days in 1964 (Friday through Christmas Eve), when she was a 24-year old woman in what she calls X-ville, a lackluster New England town.\nWhen the young Eileen is a sophomore in college, her mother dies, compelling her to return to X-ville, where she shares a dilapidated house with her father.\nHe is an alcoholic, a retired police officer who insults or ignores Eileen when he isn’t sleeping off his drunkenness or ordering her to get more liquor.\nSince coming back home, Eileen has been working for three years at a dead-end secretarial job at a private correctional facility for teenage boys. Although she fantasizes about falling in love with one of the guards, she has no friends, few interests or skills (except shoplifting), and no plans, save for vague dreams of escaping to New York City.\nMore Information Eileen\nBy Otessa Moshfegh\nPenguin Press, $25.95\nShe eats and grooms herself poorly, drinks too much, and loathes everything about herself, from her little childlike teeth, thin eyebrows, and small breasts to her nonexistent social skills.\nAll of this sounds pretty bleak, and it is.\nEileen feels terminally unhappy, angry, and hopeless: “born into the wrong life,” she thinks, the life of “a nobody, a waif,” “ugly, disgusting, unfit for the world.”\nBut despite her despondency and self-hatred, Eileen is a continuously captivating character. She points out her own shortcomings with refreshing honesty, and she offers idiosyncratic criticisms of so many different things in her life, among them neatness (“It’s easy to tell the dirtiest minds - look for the cleanest fingernails”), dogs (their deaths are so much harder to take than people’s), fruits and vegetables (like eating a bar of soap or a candle).\nEileen’s isolation spurs her into rethinking what everyone else accepts, including Christmas, in her view a holiday for those who thrive on self-pity and resentment: “That’s what all that eggnog and wine is for, after all.”\nThe turning point of Eileen’s story comes on the fourth day, Monday, when the first director of prison education, Rebecca Saint John , arrives at work.\nRebecca is everything Eileen isn’t: beautiful, well dressed, highly accomplished and Harvard-educated, at ease with herself and her importance in the world.\nWhen Rebecca takes an interest in Eileen, her attention promises friendship, personal growth, and hope — everything that has been missing from Eileen’s dreary life.\nSimple gestures from Rebecca — remembering Eileen’s name, touching her shoulder — are electrifying. In Rebecca’s company, Eileen feels flattered, excited and understood, all for the first time.\nAlthough Rebecca falls short of being a savior, Eileen ends up rescuing herself. The mature woman narrating the novel lives in a beautiful place, cares deeply for others, and loves her life. Eileen does not take us step-by-step to this conclusion but shows how personal change can get started.\nAgainst all odds, a young woman is jolted into taking matters into her own hands and growing up. “Eileen” is a remarkable novel, inspiring but not sentimental, dark but never despairing — a coming-of-age journey that stays with you, even if you’re a few years older than 24.\nMichael Fischer is vice president for faculty and student affairs at Trinity University .
