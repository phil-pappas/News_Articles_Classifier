Matt Stonie Launch slideshow » \nHe must have a stomach made from steel! World champion competitive eater Matt Stonie will compete against 11 other professional eaters to scarf down as much pasta as they can in 8 minutes at 1 p.m. Saturday under the Arc de Triomphe replica at Paris Las Vegas. \nThe contest, open to public viewing for free, takes place less than a week after 23-year-old Matt, nicknamed “Megatoad,” won Canada’s poutine-eating competition devouring 22 pounds of fries loaded with cheese curds and gravy in just 8 minutes! \nRestaurateur Steve Martorano, who is celebrating the first anniversary of his Cafe Martorano at Paris on Saturday, will present the first Las Vegas Masters Eating Championship as part of National Pasta Month. He’ll serve his signature Sunday Gravy pasta for the event. \nHere’s Matt captured on YouTube video when he set a bacon-eating record at the Daytona 500 in February. \nMatt recently dethroned former world champion Joey Chestnut, 31, at the Nathan’s hot dog-eating contest. On Saturday, both men from San Jose will go up against the third-ranked world champion, women’s champion Miki Sudo. \n“It’s the ultimate food challenge,” said Major League Eating MC Sam Barclay. “Pasta has long been regarded as one of the most difficult events on the MLE circuit. It pits man vs. woman vs. carbs vs. each other vs. themselves. This is the first of this scale on such a grand stage.” \nSmoke’s Poutinerie just opened its first Nevada venue at Rick Harrison’s Pawn Plaza here in Las Vegas last week. Founder Ryan Smolkin talked with me about the Canadian dish: “I’m loving our first store in Las Vegas. We’re here in the Entertainment Capital of the World, so why not bring our food entertainment company here? \n“The reaction has been awesome. Talk to our kitchen crew kids, and they’ll tell you anybody who’s tried it is saying it’s the most amazing thing they’ve ever had and are coming back. We were the first store to open here in Pawn Plaza, and it’s a killer. We may be tiny, but we are a giant. \n“It’s our first setup like this, in a common area, food court style. You still have the seating, but you don’t need all the space to do it. I’m loving this model. It’s the way we’ll expand for global domination. We just hit the Tampa Bay Lightning arena Thursday night, grand opening, first home game. No. 1 vendor already on Night 1. \n“Then we did the Phoenix Coyotes on Saturday. No. 1 vendor, a mile-long line of 400 who came through in an hour. Then to Las Vegas for the launch. Your Canadian visitors to Las Vegas know we’re here, and they’re huge supporters so we’re going after the rest of the locals and tourists. \n“In the last three weeks, we’ve opened 30 locations, with another 15 in the queue. It’s been craziness, dude. We grow the potatoes, so we’re not going to run out. We have cornered the potato market. We’ve created new fields, new ways of growing potatoes. Our fries are different and unique because Smoke’s invented a new way of doing fries. \n“The knockoffs have started. Not a lot in the USA yet, but in Canada there are a lot of knockoffs. But they’re opening and closing just as fast because they think they’re serving fries, cheese and gravy. They think they’re selling poutine. That’s not what we’re selling at all. Does it look like I’m selling fries, curd and gravy? We’re selling entertainment food and a good time. Nobody else grows their own potatoes and has their own cows milking them for curd. \n“I’m going to take it to the rest of the world and create this whole food category because poutinerie did not exist. Poutine is that traditional side dish. What we’ve created is the whole beauty and wealth around that. So you get that same base, the poutine is the base, but it’s loading everything you can think of on top of that, and that’s what is resonating across the globe. \n“Truffle fries are gone, man. French fries have been a staple for centuries, and what’s going on top of them? Somebody is putting stuff on top of them in every state and every city in the world, especially in the U.S. They’re already loading fries. They’re just call it something different. Everybody has been eating fries. Now everybody is loading stuff on top. \n“Matt Stonie just did 22 pounds in 8 minutes last weekend in Toronto. We have professionals from around the world for our championship. Last year, Matt dethroned Joey Chestnut and became the No. 1 eater not only of poutine but also of the world, so this was the big rematch. They had the feud. Joey did 20 1/2 pounds, so he was close. \n“We do half-pound containers in boxes. This weekend, they’ll do the world pasta championships. They go nonstop, man. They were both doing, the next day, the grilled cheese championships! After doing 22 pounds the day before. How is that even possible? These dudes are awesome. After Matt won it, 50 to 60 mostly young kids waited for him wanting autographs. He was there for an hour signing stuff.” \nI asked Ryan what’s the most popular poutine on his menu so far: “They’re going on the pulled pork. The other one is Philly cheese steak on top of fries, cheese and gravy! They’re going out the door here. It’s the steak, caramelized onions, mushrooms, red peppers all on top of fries all in that beautiful box.” \nRobin Leach of “Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous” fame has been a journalist for more than 50 years and has spent the past 15 years giving readers the inside scoop on Las Vegas, the world’s premier platinum playground. \nFollow Robin Leach on Twitter at Twitter.com/Robin_Leach . \nFollow Las Vegas Sun Entertainment + Luxury Senior Editor Don Chareunsy on Twitter at Twitter.com/VDLXEditorDon .
