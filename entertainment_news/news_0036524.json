As seen last night, unfortunately we have no control over the acts performance once onstage,” it said. \n“ ... we were extremely excited to be presented with this opportunity. Subsequently he didn’t deliver on what was billed and expected by everyone, including us.” \nThe show at The Cambridge Hotel was only announced two weeks ago. that gambino gig sounded so dodgy, hella misleading from their company — mary tran (@_elexh) October 2, 2015 Just remembered there was a Childish Gambino merch table at his \"gig\" @TheCambridge last night. Did they also have no idea he wouldn't play? — Sophie Brown (@SophieElinor) October 1, 2015 You'll hear a lot of things about that Childish Gambino gig in Newcastle but I was there and I can tell you every word you hear is true. — Seany Sean! (@sean_dunlop) October 1, 2015 The more I read and hear about tonight's gig the more I think Childish Gambino had no idea he was expected to perform a full show. — Sam Rigney (@SamRigney) October 1, 2015 Childish Gambino Source: Supplied", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:44:31.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
