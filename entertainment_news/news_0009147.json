It’s the first Disneyland he’s ever visited so he wants it to be the same for her. The love team will be accompanied in Europe by his mom and sister, and her bestfriend.\nIn previous reports, though, Liza said she doesn’t want to have a grand debut that entails stressful preparations. She’d rather keep it simple; perhaps by organizing a charity program and holding an intimate party with the beneficiaries.\nEnrique Gil and Liza Soberano\n“Birthday ko ’yun eh, so I should enjoy. Ayoko ’yung ma-i-stress ako sa debut ko na parang nine-nerbyos ako, or uptight na ganu’n,” she said in August.\nWell, it seems she’s had a change of heart. In a more recent interview with Jeff Fernando of ABS-CBN, Liza said a tad coyly, “Gusto ko lang mag-Paris… kahit pictorial lang…”\nAsked if his friendship with Liza has levelled up, the heartthrob said: “Malapit na. Sabi niya kapag 18 na siya. Malapit na mag-January so hintayin na natin.”\nStill, Enrique has been open about his feelings for her all these times.\n“Sinasabi ko sa kanya diretso. Naniniwala naman talaga ’yun, matagal na, in denial lang siya…”\nOUT OF THE ORDINARY\nAs sidebar, here are debuts by two other celebs that veer from the usual party-till-you-drop scene:\nWhen Bea Alonzo celebrated her 18th birthday on Oct. 17, 2005, a TV special titled “Bea’s Wildest Dreams” was aired wherein she got her “wildest” dreams fulfilled. Instead of having a cotillion and 18 roses, Bea opted to showcase her singing and dancing prowess on the show. One of the production numbers had her dancing with Star Magic honcho Johnny “Mr. M” Manahan.\nThe show also featured Bea and fellow actress Shaina Magdayao going on an adventure in Singapore. And, for a day, the birthday girl served as crew at a fast food restaurant, and as big sister to the less fortunate.\nJane Oineza, on the other hand, celebrated her debut inside the “Pinoy Big Brother” (“PBB”) house July 22 last year. Jane’s housemates sprung a surprise party on her, attended by her family. The highlight of the proceedings was Jane’s heartfelt message to her mom.\nJane’s rumored suitor, De La Salle University (DLSU) basketball player Jeron Teng, also entered the house to personally greet her. They ended up dancing the night away. (By Christine Allaine B.
