Pears are often associated with the fall, so these recipes will help bring that seasonal touch to any gathering you are hosting in the upcoming weeks! 2 cups, whole wheat pastry flour 1 ½, cup skim milk 1 tbsp, maple syrup/honey 2 tbsp, packed brown sugar ½ tsp, sea salt honey/syrup, to taste \nDirections: \nThis dish can be used for breakfast, dessert or just an indulgent snack. To make the pancakes, whisk the ingredients together and heat over a frying pan. As for the pears, first melt the butter in a saucepan, then add brown sugar, cinnamon and salt (as well as honey/syrup, if so desired). Then, stir in the pears and gently simmer until the pears are cooked. Serve the pears over the pancakes, with additional maple syrup if needed, and enjoy your fall treat! 2 pears (cut into 8 wedges) 2 tsp, fresh lemon juice 1 cup, arugula 3 oz, blue cheese (cut into pieces) 6 oz, thinly sliced prosciutto \nDirections: \nFor this extremely easy-to-make but artistic appetizer, start by mixing the pears and lemon juice in a large bowl. Then, layer a slice of pear, an arugula leaf, and a piece of cheese onto a piece of prosciutto, wrap together and serve! 2 firm Bartlett pears (cut into 8 wedges) ½ package, softened cream cheese 4 oz, crumbled Gorgonzola cheese ¼ cup, softened butter 26 French bread baguette slices (toasted) ½ cup, finely chopped roasted pecans (lightly salted) 2 tbsp, finely chopped fresh rosemary ¼ cup, honey \nDirections: \nBegin by preheating your grill to 350 degrees or medium high heat. First, grill the pear wedges (covered) for about 1-2 minutes on each side (should start to turn golden). Then, mix the cream cheese, Gorgonzola cheese, butter and dry sherry together and spread ½ tablespoon of the mixture on each baguette slice. Finally, place a grilled pear son each baguette, followed by a sprinkle of pecans, rosemary and a light drizzle of honey. These elegant appetizers are sure to bring the seasonal hint to any gathering! 2 tsp, unsweetened cocoa powder 2 tsp, smoked paprika 1 12-oz lamb loin (trimmed) black pepper, to taste 1 small pear (cut into 4 pieces) ½ cup, pitted green olives 1 tsp, fresh thyme leaves ½ tsp, hot paprika 1 tbsp, flaky sea salt \nDirections: \nMix the ingredients for the lamb in a small bowl, and then marinate the lamb loin with this mixture. Let the meat marinate for anywhere from 4 to 24 hours. \nTo make the relish, first toast the caraway seeds in a small dry pan for about 2 minutes, then do the same with cumin and fennel seeds—transfer into a bowl. Then add pear, olives, thyme, hot paprika, and ½ cup of oil to the bowl and mix. Preheat the grill to medium heat, and add one tablespoon of oil onto the lamb, which you will then continue to cook for about 6-8 minutes (for medium rare). Once slightly cooled, slice the lamb, top with the olive-pear relish, and enjoy your succulent dish. 1 ½ cups, all-purpose flour 1 cup, white sugar ¼ cup, instant vanilla pudding mix 1 ½ tsp, cinnamon 1/8 tsp, baking powder \nDirections: \nFirst mix the pears, eggs, water and vanilla in one bowl. Then, mix the flour, sugar, pudding mix, cinnamon, salt, baking soda and baking powder together in a separate bowl. Finally, combine the pear mixture into the flour mixture until it is well-integrated and moistened. Then, move the mixture to a loaf pan and bake for roughly 1 hour. ½ cup, shredded cheddar cheese ¼ cup, butter 6 cups, peeled and cut pears 1 tbsp, fresh lemon juice ½ cup, brown sugar 1 unbaked pie crust \nDirections: \nThis is a great, slightly unconventional, pie that has autumn written all over it, and also a creative idea for those of you thinking ahead to your thanksgiving table! Begin by mixing the brown sugar, cheese and butter until the mixture looks like crumbs. Then, mix in the sliced pears and lemon juice. \nAdd ½ cup of brown sugar, cornstarch and cinnamon in a separate bowl. Once both are combined individually, combine the sugar mixture to the pears and mix until coated. Add the pears to the pie crust and top with the crumble mixture, bake at 400 degrees for about 45 minutes and enjoy! 1 large pinch, ground cardamom 2 tsp, unsalted butter vanilla ice cream/frozen yogurt or plain Greek-style yogurt. \nDirections: \nYou will begin by finely grinding 2 tablespoons of sugar and the vanilla bean until it is finely ground. Place this into a bowl, then add ¼ cup of water and mix until the sugar is completely dissolved. Then, mix 2 teaspoons of sugar and the cardamom in another bowl. \nMelt butter over medium heat, then add the pears and cardamom-sugar mixture. Then, turn the pears over and add the vanilla water. Cover the pan and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for about 5 minutes. \nPlace just the pears onto a plate while bringing the remaining liquid in the skillet to a boil and reduce until it takes a syrupy texture (this should take about 1-2 minutes). Finally, pour the syrup onto the pears and add a scoop of your vanilla ice cream or substitute and dig in! \nModified Date: October 21, 2015 1:17 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T22:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:36:32.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
