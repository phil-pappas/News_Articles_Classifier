I had no idea what I was getting into, and I’m glad that I did it,” he said, laughing. \nEldredge, whose gratefulness for his success is apparent, answered questions over the phone Sept. 23: \nAre you excited about Las Vegas? \nI’m really pumped! I’ve been looking forward to Route 91 Harvest for a long time. It will re-electrify me. \nWhat can fans expect in your set at Route 91 Harvest on Oct. 4? \nI like my shows to be like a conversation in my living room. They’re relaxed and an escape from the outside world — a rollercoaster ride of emotions, laugh, cry, a lot of emotions. \nWill you be around to check out the first two days? \nI wish! I’ll only be there the day of the show. I’ll make the most of it, though (laughs). \nDo you prefer indoor or outdoor concerts? \nIt doesn’t really matter to me. Each one has something different to offer. I’m looking forward to the good weather in Las Vegas and sweating onstage. It lets the crowd know that I’m working. I sweat indoors, too! \nI love to perform, so I’ll hit up any stage. \nHow did your life and career change after winning the CMA New Artist of the Year award last year? \nIt escalated everything for me in a big way. It launched my career into another level. I’ve been blown away by what’s happened since. I just celebrated my first No. 1 country album. \nThe award gave a big boost to my career that I really needed. It’s a big award to win, and I’m very thankful. \nWhat was it like touring with Taylor Swift and Darius Rucker? \nThe tours were completely different, but they are both amazing people. Taylor is an incredible person, and she’s the biggest star in the world. I learned a lot from her. It was good to keep my eyes and ears open and go along for the ride. \nDarius is such a down to earth guy. He’s someone you’d want to hang out with all the time. He goes out of his way to make you feel comfortable, and you can’t not like him and his voice. I hung out with him all the time on tour. \nWhat are you working on right now? You’re going on a headlining tour with Thomas Rhett, correct? \nWe kick off Oct. 29 in New York City. We’ve always talked about doing a show together. We like hanging out, so we’re doing a co-headliner tour. I’m really excited about it. It will have a whole new energy and concept. \nDo you prefer writing, producing or performing? \nI love to see the whole process — write the song, record it, take the recording to radio, release an album, then sing it for everybody. I put my heart and soul into the entire process, and it’s amazing when it all comes together. \nWho are your music inspirations, and who are you listening to right now? \nI am a big Frank Sinatra fan. He will be my No. 1 idol forever and always. I also love Ray Charles, Brooks and Dunn, John Mayer. I grew up listening to The Eagles. The great thing about music is that there is so much accessibility to everything. \nTell me about your experience judging the Miss America Pageant a few weeks ago in Atlantic City. \n(Laughs) That was a dream come true! I had no idea what I was getting into, and I’m glad that I did it. It it’s a big deal to these girls. They spend their whole life to compete, and they get one shot. \nI tried to do my best job judging, and I’m thankful that I got to do it. It was a lot of points with my guy friends, too (laughs). \nDo you have a favorite song that you especially enjoy performing? \n“Beat of the Music.” It’s a fun song to sing live. It was the most-played song last year on country radio. The crowd sings it out loud. It’s a special moment. \nYou went skydiving and shark diving to celebrate your first two of three consecutive No. 1 songs. Have you commemorated the third? \nI haven’t yet. I’m thinking about a Dinner in the Sky experience and have been looking around for that. \nWhat do you like to do for fun in Las Vegas? \nI’m a pool guy. I like to hit up the pools, the bar at the pools and hang out and relax. I like the clubs and to gamble. There’s nothing better than the pools to drink, sit there and relax and enjoy the Las Vegas heat. \nThe 2015 Route 91 Harvest Country Music Fest is at MGM Resorts Village across from the Luxor from Friday through Sunday.
