But its sentiments, tied to a sweet melody, made it a popular round-the year song for Victorian drawing rooms.\n’T IS THE LAST ROSE OF SUMMER\n’T is the last rose of summer,\nLeft blooming alone;\nAll her lovely companions\nAre faded and gone;\nNo flower of her kindred,\nNo rosebud is nigh,\nTo reflect back her blushes\nOr give sigh for sigh!\nI’ll not leave thee, thou lone one,\nTo pine on the stem;\nSince the lovely are sleeping,\nGo, sleep thou with them;\nThus kindly I scatter\nThy leaves o’er the bed,\nWhere thy mates of the garden\nLie scentless and dead.\nSo soon may I follow,\nWhen friendship decay,\nAnd from love’s shining circle\nThe gems drop away!\nWhen true hearts lie wither’d,\nAnd fond ones have flown,\nShare article Oh! Who would inhabit\nThis bleak world alone?", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-09T07:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:32:39.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
