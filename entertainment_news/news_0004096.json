Chris Christie you need to consider his Bruce Springsteen obsession. \nCome on, the man has been to over 130 Bruce shows. \nThis week, the \"Christie Tracker Podcast\" looks at Christie, the Springsteen super fan â€“ who follows Bruce to shows, writes about him on message boards and trades tapes with fellow fans. \nWNYC/New Jersey Public Radio's Matt Katz guides us through Christie's life of worship at the Church of Springsteen and explains why messages posted 15 years ago shed light on the governor's personality today . \nWe ponder how Christie could be so attracted to the musical messages of a political polar opposite. And speaking with host David Furst , Katz explains why he finds the old posts endearing. \nAs he puts it, \"This is a total geek, geeking out with other geeks.\" \nListen to Katz describe how Jon Corzine, when he was governor, left an intimate Springsteen fundraiser show in which he performed \"Born to Run\" in its entirety. Christie was also in attendance: Christie \"ended up looking into it later to confirm, indeed, there was no emergency.\" \nIs this what made Christie run against Corzine? \nRELATED: Christie says he's no longer Springsteen's friend \nAlso: \nChristie was back in the state with the country's first primary last week. He held several town hall meetings in New Hampshire and some polls suggest he may be starting to gain a little traction there. \nScott Conroy , senior political reporter with the Huffington Post joins us to wrap up the week. \n\nCheck out the WNYC Data News App: The Christie Tracker .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:40:20.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
