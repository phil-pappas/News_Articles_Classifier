What I really like is being on stage playing characters.\" \nWhat anyone who had the luck to see Dessay on the opera stage will recall is how she made her characters come to life. \nHer portrayal of the betrayed Lucia, for example, was famously powerful -- and the Met Opera papered New York with posters of Dessay in the role for a revival there in 2011. \n\"I try to understand what she's going through, but I'm not playing the madness, I'm playing the suffering, and that's enough,\" she said. \nWith opera behind her, Dessay is alternating song recitals, with piano accompanist Philippe Cassard, and tours with the French pop song and film composer Michel Legrand, but her real passion is for live theater. \nShe recently starred in a French revival of the British playwright Howard Barker's dark, one-woman play \"Und\", about a Jewish woman whose guest is overdue for tea, and who will not accept that the reason her house comes under a series of escalating malicious attacks is because the visitor is a German camp officer. \nShe is looking for more such roles, but in the meantime she hopes her opera audiences will look out for her in the different venues where she will still be performing. \n\"It turns all the time around the same thing,\" she said. \"How to make people travel with me, how to tell them stories in different ways.\" \n(Writing by Michael Roddy; Editing by Gareth Jones ) \nOur top photos from the past 24 hours.
