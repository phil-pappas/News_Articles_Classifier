That much I know. I’ve seen them all my life.” Aspiring author Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) utters these lines at the beginning of “Crimson Peak,” setting the stage for the spooky, old-fashioned ghost story to follow. Well, old-fashioned except for all the blood. Directed and co-written by Guillermo del Toro (“Pan’s Labyrinth,” the “Hellboy” movies), “Crimson Peak” is a gothic romance/horror tale that calls to mind everything from Henry James novels to Hitchcock movies (“Rebecca” and “Notorious”) to Roger Corman’s Edgar Allan Poe adaptations starring Vincent Price to (at its most over-the-top) “The Addams Family.” Edith, who’d like to be the next Mary Shelley (author of “Frankenstein”), writes ghost stories and lives in Buffalo, New York, with her wealthy, hard-nosed, protective father (Jim Beaver). She meets and is immediately drawn to British aristocrat Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston). Despite Dad’s reservations about this penniless charmer, Edith marries Thomas and she moves into the rundown, remote English country estate inhabited by her new hubby and his humorless, severe-looking sister, Lucille (Jessica Chastain). Edith has been haunted by the ghost of her mother, but once she’s in this spooky new abode (where leaves cascade from a large hole in the ceiling to the entrance floor) she encounters other horrific apparitions, including one with a hatchet in its head. Meanwhile, Thomas tells Edith not to go in the basement. Of course, you just know that’s exactly where Edith will wind up. This mansion has deadly secrets, and it’s up to Edith to figure out what they are and what her role is in all of this. Could that role be – gulp – next victim? Del Toro gives away a lot early on, and even a big twist toward the end is obvious almost from the start. So much for surprises. The ghosts are creepy and hideous, but not really scary since we never feel they’re truly a threat to Edith. And, as Edith, Wasikowska doesn’t project much of a personality, so it’s hard to become invested in her fate. Someone like Emily Blunt or Jennifer Lawrence could have had a lot of fun with this role. Typical of a del Toro film, the star here is the production design. “Crimson Peak” looks great with its eerie mansion and ominous surroundings chillingly covered with a bright red clay. And Chastain pumps up the energy toward the end as the jealous sis. But, overall, the film drags as it keeps us waiting for the big, bloody finale. Though he and Wasikowska lack the necessary romantic chemistry, Hiddleston has the right charm to play Thomas. I kept hoping, though, that the actor would show up in his Loki costume from the “Thor” movies. “Crimson Peak” could benefit from a little more wackiness and a little less gloom.
