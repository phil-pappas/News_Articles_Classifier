(AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack, File) By Sean Gruber | Augusta Chronicle AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) — Paine College could soon be the latest school to rescind an honorary degree awarded to Bill Cosby.\nInterim President Samuel Sullivan said the school’s Board of Trustees will vote on rescinding the comedian’s 2003 honorary doctorate during a meeting next week. Sullivan said the numerous allegations of sexual assault against Cosby led the school’s leadership to consider revoking his degree.\nCosby has been accused by more than 50 women of committing sexual assault. Most recently, a model filed a lawsuit this month accusing him of drugging and sexually assaulting her in 2008 at the Playboy Mansion, according to The Asso­ciated Press.\nIn a 2005 deposition, Cos­by admitted to giving women sedatives before having sex with them. Cosby and his attorneys maintain that all of the sexual acts were consensual.\n“After all the controversy surrounding Bill Cosby of late, we decided we needed to take a position,” Sullivan said. “Considering that the school’s faculty votes to choose who receives an honorary degree, we need to make sure our staff feels\nthat Cosby deserves the honor.”\nSullivan said he planned to poll faculty members on their views, then present his findings to the board at the meeting. The board will then vote on the issue.\nSullivan said he did not want to speculate on whether Cosby’s degree will be revoked, adding that he will wait for the school’s faculty and board to make their decision.\nLast month, Brown, Ford­ham and Marquette universities rescinded honorary degrees they gave Cosby. Brown University said in a Sept. 28 news release that Cosby’s conduct was “inconsistent with the behavior we expect of any individual associated with Brown,” and\nthat the 2005 deposition played a major role in the decision.\nEight other universities are considering or discussing rescinding Cosby’s honorary degrees, including the Uni­versity of Connecticut and Am­herst College, according to an Oct. 1 story in Inside Higher Education .", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/011df8fe5cf0e92e840f6a7067003241.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/011df8fe5cf0e92e840f6a7067003241.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-17T11:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:42:46.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
