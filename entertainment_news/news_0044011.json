Spanning three stages and boasting a skateboard and BMX area, the event harkens back to the start of the Vans Warped Tour in the mid-’90s with a lineup to match. Also on the bill are 7 Seconds, Pennywise, The Vandals, Strung Out and dozens of others.\nNOFX, whose lineup includes Burkett, guitarist Eric Melvin, drummer Erik Sandlin and guitarist Aaron “El Hefe”Abeyta, started out in Los Angeles in the 1980s in the same scene that spawned fellow It’s Not Dead compatriots Bad Religion and Descendents. But for NOFX, the climb to punk royalty was longer.\n“We were terrible for eight years in the ‘80s. I mean terrible, terrible , but we stuck with it. We stuck with punk rock. We didn’t try to fit into what was happening. In ‘94 when punk broke we were at a perfect place cause we were pretty good by then,” Burkett said. “Then we decided to not make any videos and not do any radio and that worked out good for us, too.”\nRemaining fiercely independent, the band built a following that maintained its support with albums such as “Punk in Drublic” and “So Long and Thanks for All the Shoes.”\nBurkett also started his own record label, Fat Wreck Chords, which signed many of the bands playing It’s Not Dead, including Lagwagon, Less Than Jake and Anti-Flag.\n“We started out to be a punk label and after 25 years we’re still a punk label and we still put out good music and I don’t want to put out anything I don’t like and it’s really that simple. You figure out what you want to do and you do it right,” Burkett said.\nThe same mantra is there for NOFX’s music. Burkett, primary writer for the band, will take his time penning songs. He spent six months writing the 18-minute-long song “The Decline,” he said. The effort put in is one of the keys to NOFX’s longevity.\n“Us and Bad Religion, I think we both consistently put out good records and so many bands don’t, I don’t know what it is. It’s not like easy. It takes months and months to write a good record,” Burkett said.\nContact the writer: vfranko@pe.com or @vanessafranko on Twitter", "external_links": ["http://www.itsnotdeadfestival.com/"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:42:15.089+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
