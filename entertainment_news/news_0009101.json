That's cray!\"\nObama, aka POTUS, also joked that West has his own nickname for the person in the White House — Peezy (that's someone who is really, really cool).\nWest also is thinking about running for speaker of the House, Obama cracked.\n\"Couldn't get any stranger,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T22:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T03:37:53.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
