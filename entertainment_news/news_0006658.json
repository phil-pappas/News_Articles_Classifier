The Blackfish. \n\" Game of Thrones \" may bring back another character who hasn't been seen in quite a long time for season 6. It has been reported that Brynden Tully a.k.a. The Blackfish, who was last seen during the Red Wedding in season 3, will return in next season. According to Los Siete Reinos (via Watchers of the Wall), actor Clive Russell who plays the character was recently spotted filming his scenes in Corbet, Northern Ireland. The Blackfish will return as a part of a major Jaime Lannister ( Nikolaj Coster-Waldau ) storyline, which was first reported in September. [SPOILER ALERT!] The said storyline taken from the books will see Jaime and Bronn journeying into the Riverlands together. It appears that The Blackfish will be defending Riverrun from the Lannister's attack. This storyline will also allow the return of Edmure Tully (Tobias Menzies), Catelyn Stark's (Michelle Fairly) younger brother, who has been held captive by the Freys since the Red Wedding. If the TV show stays true to the book, fans can also expect to see Lady Stoneheart, the zombified version of Catelyn, who leads the Brotherhood Without Banners across the lands. Fairly previously strongly denied that her character Catelyn would be resurrected on the TV series, but the actress was recently spotted hanging out with a \"GoT\" co-star in Belfast, where the sixth season is being filmed. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:29:34.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
