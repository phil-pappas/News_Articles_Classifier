All they have, literally, is the Kardashians,\" she said. \"Is that a great message for little girls, a whole family of women who take the faces they were born with as a light suggestion?\" \nThe 'Trainwreck' star later starred in a mock PSA video about guns, taking aim at the US's relationship with weapons.
