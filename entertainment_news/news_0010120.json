The crew spent three years training wolves for the movie. \nChina Film News said it has been replaced by \"Go Away Mr. Tumor,\" a romantic comedy about an optimistic woman coping with cancer. \nThe last Chinese submission to be nominated for best foreign language film was Zhang Yimou's 2002 film \"Hero.\" Â© 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc.
