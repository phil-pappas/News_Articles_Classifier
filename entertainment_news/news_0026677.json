In the op-ed, titled “Why Do I Make Less than My Male Co-Stars?,” the actress addresses the standards she faces as a woman in Hollywood. \nShe says thanks to the Sony hack, she learned how much less she was being paid than her male counterparts — in particular, her American Hustle co-stars Bradley Cooper, Christian Bale and Jeremy Renner. \n“I got mad at myself,” she writes. “I failed as a negotiator because I gave up early. I didn’t want to keep fighting over millions of dollars that, frankly, due to two franchises, I don’t need. (I told you it wasn’t relatable, don’t hate me).” \nJ. Law also says she didn’t fight hard enough because she didn’t want to come across as “difficult” or “spoiled.” \n“At the time, that seemed like a fine idea, until I saw the payroll on the Internet and realized every man I was working with definitely didn’t worry about being ‘difficult’ or ‘spoiled,’” she writes. \nNow, she says, she’s done trying to be polite. “I’m over trying to find the ‘adorable’ way to state my opinion and still be likable!” she writes. “F*** that. I don’t think I’ve ever worked for a man in charge who spent time contemplating what angle he should use to have his voice heard. It’s just heard.” \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio. All rights reserved.
