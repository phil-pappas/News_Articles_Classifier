(March 20 - April 19): Multi-tasking isn't your strong suit. Stagger projects over the next few weeks and you'll wind up ahead of the game instead of struggling from behind.\nTAURUS. (April 20 - May 20): Innovation isn't worth it if others aren't interested. You can push the envelope all you like but at the end of the day it's still stationery.\nGEMINI. (May 21 - June 20): Are you on the verge of doing something you'll regret? Rethink that rash impulse of yours while you can.\nCANCER. (June 21 - July 21): Pluto has a zero tolerance policy when it comes to ducking harsh truths. Whatever was sidestepped back in April will have to be faced today.\nLEO. (July 22 - Aug. 22): People will weigh in with all kinds of opinions and judgments, but you really must stick to your guns. You know what's best and you need to be bold and unwavering.\nVIRGO. (Aug. 23 - Sept. 22): Don't worry if you feel fatigued, aimless, and lost at sea. It's because of the Mars/Neptune opposition. The effect passes on Oct. 14.\nLIBRA. (Sept. 23 - Oct. 22): You may not think that you're capable of doing what should have been done all along, but you are.\nSCORPIO. (Oct. 23 - Nov. 21): It's a tricky business owning up to your mistakes, but in the end you have to remember that you're doing this for yourself and not to win people's favor.\nSAGITTARIUS. (Nov. 22 - Dec. 20): Monetary worth is a direct reflection of self-worth. Would you pay top dollar for the kind of job you're doing? You'll find out today.\nCAPRICORN. (Dec. 21 - Jan. 19): There's a higher purpose being served by your current fiasco. It's meant to get you to lean on others for a change instead of vice-versa.\nAQUARIUS. (Jan. 20 - Feb. 17): Only by offloading obligations that aren't really necessary will you be able to focus on what truly matters.\nPISCES. (Feb. 18 - March 19): A competitor makes for a better sounding board than a friend. This helps to improve your job performance because you're not being coddled; you're being challenged.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T01:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T09:14:21.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
