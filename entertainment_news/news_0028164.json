Kathmandu is also on his scheduled album launch tour.\nFor latest Music updates follow us on Twitter >>> @TOIEntertain\nFor the latest in Music news, like us on Facebook >>> TOIEntertain\n\"Shots Fired is my way of saying that I have arrived even though I have been part of the music scene for the last 8 years. A lot of blood, sweat and tears has gone into the production and creation of it, so I'm confident about this piece of work and people should now take notice of my music,\" says Johar.\nThe nine track album made under the umbrella genre of global bass comprises some songs having elements of Drum and Bass and Trap and fuses some Indian elements.\nThe bilingual album with songs in both Hindi and English Tracks like 'Thar Bomb' with elements of glitch hop are fused with folk vocals whereas the track 'Nepal' is twerk.\nFor more interesting Music news and pictures follow us on Pinterest>>> timesofindia\nFor latest Music updates follow us on G+ >>> The Times of India Entertainment\nAiming to cement his music on a global level, Johar says he has attempted putting in the elements that identify the music as Indian even though it appeals to the global audience.\n\"It's of global bass genre even though its very heavy on the rhythm but there's focus on melody and musical content of it. The tracks, 'Greed is God' and 'Pick It Up' are international in feel whereas the tracks 'Storm and Jungle Raj' are in Hindi. So all these components are demonstrated well in the album,\" says MojoJojo.\nThe musician says the track 'Nepal' is his tribute to the country's people emerging from a devastating earthquake. He says he had recorded some random sounds from monastries during his trip to Mcloedganj last year with no idea that it would turn into a full fledged record one day.\n\"The chanting in the track 'Nepal' was recorded in Mcleodganj in one of the monasteries. I just recorded it without any idea that I'll make a track out of it. The earthquake struck one week before I was supposed to play there,\" says Johar.\n\"Realising the devastation that happened there affected me a lot and once I sat in the studio and realised these chantings can be used to produce a track. Hence, I have planned a gig there too to show solidarity to people and make sure they have a good time,\" he says.\nThe 26-year-old multi-city launch tour with performances is scheduled to end at the Sunburn city festival in November where he is set to open for big international musicians such as DJ Snake and R3hab.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TOIEntertain", "https://www.pinterest.com/timesofindia/", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107628521107103264647/+TOIEntertainment/posts", "https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:30:20.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
