He was charged as an adult with three counts of murder, District Attorney Vern Pierson said.\nAuthorities found the bodies in the aftermath of a Sept. 13 fire at the family's cabin in Greenwood, about 50 miles northeast of Sacramento.\nThe remains were identified as Adam Buchanan, 38, his fiancé Molly McAfee, 37, and their son Gavin.\nNolan Buchanan told investigators the three took a trip to the cabin and he had chosen not to go, D'Agostini said.\nAfter finding the blaze suspicious, deputies searched the Buchanan home and Adam Buchanan's office in Benicia, a San Francisco Bay Area city about 100 miles away, seizing records, computers and a pickup truck.\nThe search turned up Adam Buchanan's wallet and ID, McAfee's purse, a gun, ammunition and other evidence that led to the arrest of Nolan Buchanan, D'Agostini said.\nThe teen was expected to appear in court Friday or Monday, Pierson said. It wasn't clear whether he had an attorney yet who could comment on his case.\nThe sheriff said such grisly cases are not unheard of in his mostly rural county, but they are rare.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T18:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:24:00.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
