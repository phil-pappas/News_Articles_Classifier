I think I got 16 so they're in the freezer right now.\" \nShe admits going ahead with the procedure has been huge, because she no longer feels the need to settle down. \n\"I think I just wanna take the pressure off, you know?,\" she continued. \"Before I froze my eggs it was like, 'I gotta move'. I was stressed out all the time. It was like, 'I gotta find a guy, I gotta find a guy, I gotta move on'. It permeated everything I did... So now I froze my eggs the pressure's off... I'm chilled out.\" \nCummings has also adopted a new beauty regime in recent months and is hoping the youthful glow she gets from having the popular \"vampire facial\" will help her find a new man. \n\"They suck your blood, they spin it, take out PRP (protein-rich plasma)... and then they drill the PRPs back into your face with microdermabrasion,\" she explained. \n\"It's helping with baldness and regenerated growth. they say it's like getting a facelift without having to get a cutting facelift (sic).\" \nThe news emerges two months after Cummings dismissed rumors suggesting she had undergone plastic surgery on her face. \nShe instead blamed her new look on the extra 25 pounds (11.3 kilograms) she had gained in recent months. \n\"I did this weird thing that nobody likes to do anymore where I gained weight,\" she confessed on a previous appearance on \"Today.\"\"I gained, like, 25 pounds, which I think I needed to. I was way too skinny before. \n\"Here's the thing: When you're on television, you get confused. I looked like I was passing away and I put on, like, 20 pounds. I think it (her face) filled out... People think I got a facelift.\" Copyright WENN.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T23:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T05:24:07.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
