Besides, the veteran kicker was released on Saturday and free agent kicker Chris Boswell was brought in. \nSo, problem solved, right? Not necessarily. \nAs Markus Wheaton points out, there's a little more at work here. \n\"We just have got to finish, got to finish,\" the wide receiver said. \"We had a couple drives, we get down to the red zone, where we didn't convert. That's just been us. Even into last year, that's been us.\" \nThe red-zone or near red-zone issues have been a recurring problem for them the past two seasons, predating Scobee, predating the suspensions to Le'Veon Bell and Martavis Bryant and predating the injuries to Maurkice Pouncey and Ben Roethlisberger. \nOutside of the Steelers' dominant Week 2 win over San Francisco in which they converted 5-of-5, they've been 4-of-7. That's far more in line with their 19th ranking of last season, when they scored touchdowns on 51.7 percent of their chances inside the 20. \nAgainst Baltimore, they had to settle for two Scobee field goals, including a 36-yarder before halftime. \nWhether it's red zone opportunities or on third down, the Steelers need to do a better job of converting when they get their chances to finish. \nWhile the Steelers' inability to convert a pair of fourth-down chances in overtime led to Thursday's loss against the Ravens, don't forget about their inability to move the chains in the 65 minutes or so prior to that. \nThe Steelers offense, ranked No. 2 overall last season and a unit for which great things are expected, has been middle of the pack on third-down conversions this season. They've been under 50 percent in both losses to the Patriots and Ravens. \nLast year, they were a strong 44.7, finishing fifth in the league. Through four games this season they are 14th, converting just 21 of 50 (42 percent). In Thursday's overtime loss against Baltimore, the Steelers were nothing short of awful in extending drives. They converted just 2-of-13 on third down as the Steelers snared defeat from the jaws of victory. \nWorse, the Steelers never gave themselves a realistic chance. In regulation the Steelers had no manageable third downs, averaging 8.36 yards to pick up a possible first down. \nIt wasn't until overtime that the Steelers had a pair of third-and-2 situations. They failed both times and, most famously, again on fourth down. \nPerhaps the bigger story in Thursday's loss shouldn't be about Mike Vick's keeper that was stuffed or his errant throw to Antonio Brown, but rather about all the missed opportunities on first, second and third down before that. \nSince taking over for Roetlisberger in the third quarter at St. Louis, the Steelers are 2-of-18 on third down (Vick was 0-for-5 against the Rams). The veteran quarterback, who averaged just 4.78 per attempt, needs to throw deeper on first and second down. He needs to get in better sync with his receivers. The sooner that happens for the Steelers, the better. \n\"My (confidence) level is getting there,\" Vick said. \"I was very comfortable. We missed opportunities. We just need to get it done.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T06:21:46.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
