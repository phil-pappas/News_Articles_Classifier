Mendoza, File) Sponsored Links The Associated Press BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. â€” \nAn artwork that gallery officials say was created at a former Detroit auto plant by elusive British graffiti artist Banksy has sold at auction for $137,500. \nThe Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News report the piece was sold Wednesday at Julien's Auctions in Beverly Hills, California. An 8-foot, 1,500-pound section of cinderblock wall featuring the artwork was excavated from the Packard Plant site in 2010 by the nonprofit 555 gallery in Detroit. \nThe mural features child holding a bucket of red paint and a brush next to a message that says: \"I remember when all this was trees.\" \nThe 555 gallery will get $110,000 from the sale, and officials plan to use it to renovate the gallery's new permanent home. \nBanksy is known for anonymously leaving his work in public areas.
