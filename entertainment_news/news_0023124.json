Duchess of Cambridge in Jenny Packham gown and diamond tiara joins the royal welcome for President Xi Jinping pic.twitter.com/3857sl1r7K — Juliet Rieden (@JulietRieden) October 20, 2015 \nThis bauble is borrowed from Queen Elizabeth II, Kate's grandmother-in-law, but it once belonged to the queen's late mother and sister, the late Princess Margaret. \nKate has worn this tiara before, at the annual diplomatic reception at the palace in 2013, but Tuesday night's banquet was only the third time she's worn a tiara in public since joining the royal family in 2011. \nThe occasion for all the jewels and finery (plus white gloves on the queen) was a state banquet for visiting Chinese President Xi Jinping and his wife, Peng Liyuan, who received an official royal welcome Tuesday — complete with pomp, pageantry, a 41-gun royal salute, and a ride in a gilt-encrusted royal carriage down The Mall — for their four-day state visit to the United Kingdom. \nThe Telegraph reported that Kate was seated at the banquet in the most prominent position for a female royal, after the queen: on the Chinese president's right while the monarch, as is custom, sat on Xi's left. Besides her borrowed tiara, her diamond earrings also were borrowed from the queen. \nKate and husband Prince William, the third in line to the throne, have been included because it was William, during his own visit to China in March, who issued the invitation to the Chinese president on behalf of the queen. \nOn Monday, William delivered a first-ever speech for Chinese television on the urgent need to combat the illegal wildlife trade, some of which is spurred by demand from China.

The queen hosts two of these banquets every year, and she's been on her throne for 63 years. \nSome 170 guests (royals, politicos, celebrities, the great and the good) have been invited (or \"commanded\") by the queen, and all of them are dressed to the nines as they gather around a huge horseshoe-shaped table in the palace banquet room to eat (the menu included venison from royal Balmoral estate), chat and toast about what the two governments have called a \"golden age\" of relations.

Will said he proposed while on holiday in Kenya, using his mother's engagement ring in order to include the lost princess in the excitement surrounding the pending nuptials. AP Fullscreen It was certainly the most watched wedding ever.

Here they leave Westminster Abbey after the nuptials, headed for Buckingham Palace and kisses on the balcony. Ian Langsdon, European Pressphoto Agency Fullscreen Not once but twice they kissed on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, following in the tradition set by his parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana.

Matt Dunham, AP Fullscreen The next day they walked out of St. James's Palace, boarded a helicopter and flew off for a secret honeymoon (at a luxury resort in the Seychelles islands in the Indian Ocean). This, by the way, is the first glimpse most people had of her favorite navy blue wedges by Stuart Weitzman, which she would wear numerous times in public over the next three years. But she had yet to learn important lessons about the risks of wearing short, flirty skirts in high winds.

Possibly the most covered play-date ever, it was a festival of cuteness. Government House / Getty Images Fullscreen George got down on the floor to play with intriguing toys and other babies during his Plunket Play Group appearance in Wellington, N.Z. He smiled, he gurgled, he crawled, he interacted with some of the other babies, and the photographers loved every minute.

Woolf Crown Copywrite/ AFP/Getty Images When next seen, this time in his father's arms at the Wellington, N.Z., airport, George and his parents were off to Australia, on April 16.

Rob Griffith/ AP Fullscreen After arriving at Admiralty House, the official Sydney residence of the Governor-General, Sir Peter Cosgrove presents George with one of the many gifts he received Down Under, in this case a giant stuffed wombat. He seemed to be pleased, but Prince William, whose own nickname as a baby was Wombat, was especially excited.

The zoo's Bilby Enclosure has been renamed for George and the baby got to meet a bilby (a bunny-like marsupial) also called George. He got up close and personal with the critter, even tried to reach in and grab it, although Kate made sure he didn't. Baby George \"has got quite a strong grip,\" she told the zookeeper. Samir Hussein WireImage The zoo visit was a huge success from a picture standpoint. George looked ready for anything when he arrived in his mother's arms at the Bilby Enclosure. Samir Hussein / WireImage Fullscreen George was engaged, active and vocal during the zoo trip, the most we had seen him up to that point. Photographers were able to snap scores of pictures showing the family interacting in a way that showed a happy baby with adoring parents. Photo by Samir Hussein/ WireImage George got a stuffed bilby at the zoo, but he eventually dropped it as he gnawed on a yellow bumper sticker that read \"Wild Child On Board.\" Photo by Chris Jackson/ Getty Images Fullscreen Another airport arrival, another quick glimpse of George, here in Canberra on April 20. Despite some worries beforehand, according to Prince William, George turned out to be a trooper when it came to long-distance flights, and every time he came off or got on an airplane he was engaged and wriggling vigorously. Photo by Cole Bennetts/ Getty Images Fullscreen After three weeks, the Australian tour was over and the family prepared to depart from Canberra, on April 25. Once again there was a brief glimpse of George as his parents boarded their aircraft for the 25-hour journey back to the U.K. Photo by Samir Hussein/ WireImage Fullscreen When next seen, George was 11 months old and almost walking on his own. Kate took him to a polo match where Prince William was playing in Gloucestershire, on June 15, and photographers were able to snap him crawling and walking with the help of his mum. Splash News Turns out 'Vanity Fair' thought that picture of the family at the Sydney zoo would make a perfect cover shot for their August issue celebrating George's first birthday. Photo by Samir Hussein/ WireImage Fullscreen To mark his first birthday, Will and Kate took George to London's Natural History Museum to see a butterfly exhibit, where a photographer from the Press Association took his official birthday photos. He's walking on his own, arms out, dressed in pinstriped overalls and a navy blue shirt, shoes and socks, with something of a Mona Lisa smile on his face. \"Look who's walking!\" tweeted the palace. As hordes on Twitter said, we're dying of cuteness.
