His rep told ABC News Goodman's weight loss is due to basic exercise and diet, which the actor's focusing on now. \nThis isn't the first time Goodman has slimmed down: in 2010, he lost more than 100 pounds. \"I wanted to live life better,\" he told People magazine at the time, adding that he quit drinking and worked out six days a week. He also told David Letterman during that time that he knows his weight will be an ongoing battle and that \"I'm not gonna look like Paris Hilton or anything.\" \nTrumbo , starring Bryan Cranston as Hollywood screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, is out Nov. 6. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:25:54.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
