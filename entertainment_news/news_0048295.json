It's been a sharp thrill from start to finish.\" \nLoosely based on her 2009 memoirs The Tent, The Bucket and Me, each episode is introduced by 10-year-old Star Wars obsessed tom-boy Emma Kennedy (Lucy Hutchison). \nShe is happy to tag along with her much-loved parents, Brenda and Tony Kennedy (Katherine Parkinson and Dan Skinner). \nThe family have just moved into a new estate in Stevenage, New Town and arrive to a concrete labyrinth of similar abodes. \nDelighted at the fact they are now on the verge of being considered middle class, they soon embrace community spirit and organise activities for the neighbourhood to get involved in. \nLending a hand with the laughs are their best friends - an unmarried couple, Tim the 70s alpha-male (Harry Peacock), and the young yet traditional Jenny (Emma Pierson). \nShola Adewusi and Clive Rowe also star as The Kennedys' unassuming and often confused neighbours, Dee and David. \nGiven some of her family's disastrous holidays, there was little wonder Emma Kennedy's early life was such a rich vein of comedy gold. \nAt the age of six she was pulled from a French toilet cubicle, aka a hole in the ground, after stumbling around in the dark. \nHer dad put her in a bin bag, tied it under her neck and drove her to a garage forecourt where he hosed her down. \nYears later, after giggling about her disastrous youth with her folks, Emma wrote all the anecdotes down, and the result was The Tent, The Bucket and Me. \nAlthough the 10 chapters were just about holidays, to avoid repetition Emma decided to change the format for this series. It gave her the chance to add a lot of the non holiday-related anecdotes that couldn't go into the book. \nShe also changed the nationality of her French neighbours to Danish, because she's friends with Sofie Grabol, the actress who stars in Euro hit The Killing. It was her idea to make the neighbours a lesbian couple. \n(Grabol wanted a role in the show, but had to drop out due to filming commitments). \nAll great sitcoms need a degree of poignancy, and the fact Emma's mum Brenda, who died in May 2014, was offering advice on this series in her final days means the on screen result is also a fine tribute to the off screen family who inspired it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:44:04.934+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
