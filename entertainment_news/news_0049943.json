Knopf celebrated its centennial with an all-star party at the main branch of the New York Public Library. \nMore than a thousand people crowded into the library's marbled Astor Hall to pay tribute Thursday to Knopf, home to prize-winners Morrison and Robert Caro and such commercial sensations as the late Stieg Larsson. \nSmith's memoir \"M Train\" just came out. Smith says she was drawn to such Knopf authors as Albert Camus and to the publisher's trademark image of a racing Borzoi, or Russian wolfhound. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:03:31.267+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
