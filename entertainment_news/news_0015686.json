Patricia Decker View all 7 photos Stopping in LA on a promotional US tour, José Galante demonstrated the progress Bodegas Salentein has made, pouring a half dozen wines from their lineup for LA wine journalists at Larsen’s Steakhouse in Encino. From the entry level “Killka” wines of Torrontes and a lower elevation Malbec to the single vineyard “Plots” of Chardonnay and Malbec, these wines are expressive and reasonably priced.\nPatricia Decker The 2014 Killka Torrontes is aromatic and delightful, full of white flowers, citrus, lychee and yellow plum fruit, a bit fleshy yet balanced with juicy acidity, and a medium long finish. The 2013 Killka Malbec has the cherry and plum notes of lower elevation vineyards, oak flavors from oak staves instead of barrels, medium acidity, and a velvety finish. The Killka wines feature colorful labels of paintings by Argentine artists, the Torrontes sports the \"Looking for Love in the City\" by Antonio Segui, and the Malbec, “The Blue Chair” by Carlos Alonso. Killka wines retail for $15, at that price, they can be your house or party wine.\nThe 2012 Salentein Single Vineyard Chardonnay is an homage to California, a big golden Chardonnay with apple and pear fruit, lifted by citrus notes, and infused with a mineral character. This full-bodied wine is luscious, creamy, and textured, yet offset by juicy acidity, it’s framed by vanilla notes from new French oak barrels. The grapes are harvested from densely planted vines in Salentein’s highest vineyard, San Pablo, at 5400 ft, and dry farmed, with the only water coming from Andes’ snow melt. This single vineyard Chardonnay is rich and intense, with a long and satisfying finish. Retailing for $50, it is comparable and perhaps more distinctive than many California Chardonnays in that price range.\nThe 2012 Salentein Single Vineyard \"La Pampa\" Malbec is spectacular, with blackberry and plum fruit, sweet tobacco, leather, and a touch of balsamic, the flavor profile reflecting the 4300 ft high Plot 21 vineyard. It’s polished and elegant, with mild ripe tannins, medium acidity, integrated oak from 18 months in new French oak barrels, finishing long and juicy. A beautiful wine, delicious on its own, and excellent with steak, it retails for $50, yummy and well worth the price.\nThe 2013 Salentein Reserve Malbec is delicious, elegant and complex in flavor, a deep purple wine with blackberry and plum fruit, spice, tobacco, and herbal notes of thyme and oregano. Moderate tannins round out a pleasantly long finish. Its a blend of different altitude grapes, aged for 12 months in French oak, which exhibits finesse for the incredible price of $18.99, a steal!\nFinally, the 2012 Salentein Numina Gran Corte , a red blend of 62% Malbec, 21% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Merlot, 5% Petit Verdot, and 5% Cabernet Franc, is their version of a Bordeaux blend. The grape percentages change from year to year, according to the vintage, with Malbec always the majority grape. It’s a smooth wine, with black cherry, ripe plum, and blueberry fruit, tobacco and spice, and hints of cocoa, herbs, and leather. A balanced, complex wine with medium acidity, body, and tannins, and a long finish, “Numina” translates to “spirit”, defining the essence of the Salentein estate. Numina is a reflection of vintage and terroir, and retails for $40.\nAs far as Bodegas Salentein ’s future is concerned, José Galante is expanding their lineup, delving into Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Noir, and Cabernet Franc, to mention a few. It’s this “Burgundy to Bordeaux” mix of grape varietals that makes Salentein unique in Argentina and the world. Balance, finesse, and elegance is Galante’s mantra for all the wines, no matter the category. Galante just completed his 40th anniversary vintage, and Salentein’s wines benefit from his perspective and knowledge. The 2015 harvest was “very nice”, according to Galante, with many outstanding wines on the horizon. In the meantime, Bodegas Salentein has designated Los Angeles to be the first market to receive their very limited single vineyard wines, with only 56 cases allotted to the entire US.\nWhile Malbec may be Argentina’s superstar wine, Salentein crafts many other premium and award-winning wines. Keep an eye out for Bodegas Salentein, the wines express the altitude of excellence.", "external_links": ["http://www.bodegasalentein.com/imagenes/vinos/2015-05/19-reserve-malbec-2013-ing.pdf", "http://www.palmbay.com/databaseimages/technicalsheets/Salentein_Single_Vineyard_Malbec_TS.pdf", "http://www.sommjournal.com/Stories/Web-Exclusives/2015/Jose-Galante-Celebrates-his-40th-Harvest.aspx#.VhLt1KRCZXs", "http://www.palmbay.com/databaseimages/technicalsheets/killka_malbec_ts.pdf", "http://www.bodegasalentein.com/imagenes/vinos/2014-07/7-numina_2011_eng.pdf", "http://www.palmbay.com/databaseimages/technicalsheets/killka_torrontes_ts.pdf", "http://www.bodegasalentein.com/imagenes/vinos/2015-05/58-ft_sv_chard_2013_eng.pdf", "http://larsensrestaurants.com/category/larsens-location/encino/", "http://www.bodegasalentein.com/en/bodega/acerca/salentein.html", "http://www.bodegasalentein.com/en/bodega/lineas.html"], "published": "2015-10-06T00:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:43:25.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
