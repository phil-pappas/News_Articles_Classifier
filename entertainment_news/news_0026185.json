(Page 1 of 2) - NEXT PAGE | SINGLE PAGE \nSINGAPORE – Organisers of the 26th edition of Singapore International Film Festival (SGIFF) have announced this year’s final line-up that sees 146 feature and short films from 51 countries. \nFollowing its highly successful comeback last year that saw an audience draw of more than 10,000, this year, South-east Asia’s longest-running international film platform will be held from Nov 26 to Dec 6 with a continued focus to celebrate independent cinema in the region, telling the Asia story in film. \nSelected from an initial list of more than 1,400 entries submitted this year, the line-up will include five world premieres, four international premieres and 18 Asian premieres for feature films. \nA special programme this year is the section called Between Visible And Invisible: Alternative Vision Of Chinese Independent Documentary, which gives depth to Asian cinema. The contemporary independent documentaries featured here – such as Li Wen At West Lake, A Young Patriot and The Vanishing Spring Light – stem from the lineage of retaliation to state-controlled media guidelines that was prevalent in the late 1980s. \nNow, Audiences will be able to observe how these underground film-makers confront reality with a bare and direct observational style, and through the voice of the minorities, provide alternative and microcosmic views of China to the world. \nSGIFF’s festival director, Zhang Wenjie said: “We are now at the crossroads of a very exciting time for independent cinema and SGIFF meets the growing demand by bringing together a rich mix of film-makers and showcasing their works ... (These films) also reflect the relevance of the festival in giving a voice to these independent storytellers, while identifying fresh approaches and innovation in the film-making industry.” \nKeeping it local has always been one of the main thrusts of the SGIFF and this year, on top of the two iconic Singapore films leading the line-up for the Classics segment of the SGIFF (Eric Khoo’s Mee Pok Man and Yonfan’s Bugis Street Redux), is a slew of other local offerings. \nKhoo’s highly anticipated erotic drama In The Room will be making its Singapore premiere in the Special Presentation section; while the Singapore Panorama section, which was established in 2008, includes 13 film offerings this year. \nThe films include Singapore’s multi-disciplinary artist Ng Xi Jie’s world premiere of her first feature film, Singapore Minstrel, which offers a glimpse into the art of busking in the metropolitan city through the eyes of Roy Payamal, a stalwart of Singapore’s busking scene; Green Zeng’s The Return, which was the first feature-length Singapore film selected for competition at the Venice International Film Festival; and the world premiere of Eva Tang’s The Songs We Sang, the first feature-length documentary about the local music movement called xinyao. \n“I remember watching Mee Pok Man all those years ago,” said Zhang. “That was the film that gave me hope for the Singapore film industry. Can you imagine – no Singapore feature films were being made back then? I’m glad that we’re celebrating the 20th anniversary of Eric’s groundbreaking film at the festival.” (Page 1 of 2) - NEXT PAGE | SINGLE PAGE Pages", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T07:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:19:05.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
