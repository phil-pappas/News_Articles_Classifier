The reading curriculum created for middle school educators utilizes student leadership material from the book for educational activities that aligns with the Common Core standards with close reading exercises and Bloom’s Taxonomy structured questions. The curriculum follows core educational guidelines, and the plans are available for no cost online through the Outlier Series store on Teachers Pay Teachers. “I am excited to provide engaging curriculum developed by an incredibly talented and experienced educator at no cost to teachers. Our teachers are the leaders and shapers of the future, and we are delighted to help them impart fresh material on young minds that will encourage humility, kindness, calmness, integrity, and anti-bullying efforts as leadership qualities. We are excited to make it even easier for teachers to focus on finding great material without the worry of emptying their own pockets. This is our way of saying thank you,\" said Dr. John Shufeldt.\nThe leadership curriculum has been listed on teacherspayteachers.com for the last year, couched with extra, less essential content at the minimum cost required for the page count. In order to comply with the online retailer’s guidelines for complimentary content, Outliers Publishing decreased the page length, offering the most essential core content close reading material to teachers at no cost. Dr. John Shufeldt still plans to offer the rest of the bonus material, such as warm up questions and exit tickets, at a later date.\nDr. John Shufeldt and Outliers Publishing hired educational consultant Tiffany Panessa, originator of the curriculum, and teacher Maribeth Sublette, consulting partner, to recreate these shorter, more potent segments.\n“When Author John Shufeldt came to me to find out how we could make the reading curriculum available to teachers at no cost, I was excited for the challenge to re-work the great material we already developed into shorter segments. As a teacher, many times our ideas are limited by time and cost. This way each teacher has the option to bite off sections of the chapter as their schedule allows, and budget is no longer a limiting factor,” said Tiffany Panessa, curriculum developer and educational consultant.\nClose reading curriculum for chapters one and two of Ingredients of Young Outliers are now available on TeachersPayTeachers.com. The remaining fourteen chapters will be released over the course of November and December, 2015.\nFor questions about the reading curriculum, visit http://www.ingredientsofoutliers.com/resources-for-teachers-common-core-curriculum .
