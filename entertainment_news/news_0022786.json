The Churchtown native is set to become a global star thanks to his role as James Bond's boss in the upcoming 007 instalment, Spectre.\nAndrew Scott \"I think there is a certain mistake where you think, 'Right, I've been in that film which was big, now I have to be in an even bigger film',\" he said.\n\"And I think the luxury of not having that scrutiny before Sherlock means I'm not addicted to [fame].\n\"I have a balanced sense now. I'm not 21, I'm nearly f***ing 40, so I know what it's about,\" he added.\nAndrew Scott While we will also see Scott in an upcoming adaptation of children's classic Swallows and Amazons, he said big budget movies aren't going to be the only films on his CV.\n\"I don't want to be a slave to that. We're not here that long,\" he said.\n\"So if I want to do a really cool film with great people and it pays f*** all, I want to go and do that,\" he told the Sunday Times Culture magazine.\nScott returned to theatre after a 15-year break earlier this year in Sea Wall and plans to get back on stage in Dublin before the year is out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:42:54.282+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
