Newton and Bobby Seale. Nelson’s potent documentary is compelling enough to convince even those unfamiliar with the heritage that the lessons of the Panthers sadly remain as relevant as ever. Even as we mark the 50th anniversary of the passage of the Voting Rights Act, the country is once again grappling with issues of police brutality, bigotry and social inequality. \nThe Emmy-winning Nelson (“Freedom Summer,” “The Murder of Emmett Till”) celebrates the charisma of the movement but also explores the reality beneath “the swagger.” While mainstream media images of the Panthers usually revolve around black leather jackets, dark sunglasses and big guns, the signature badass look of the party, the film drills down into the reasons the party so quickly became beloved by black people from Berkeley to Brooklyn. At a time when it was radical to assert that black lives matter, the Panthers dared to live it. From free breakfasts for hungry children to medical care and preschool, the party gave the community the things it had so long been denied. This wasn’t just lip service. The party fed an estimated 20,000 meals a week. \nThe full bowl, and not a raised fist of power, was the symbol of the party that mattered to most of its believers. \nOf course, that grass-roots popularity made the party even more of a threat to the establishment. Gov. Reagan warned about the rise of black power. J. Edgar Hoover resolved to destroy the organization, by any means necessary, with the often nefarious strategies of the COINTELPRO project, which was not above violence, sabotage and blackmail. Hoover branded the party “the greatest threat to the internal security of the country.” \nNelson is not one to sugarcoat history. The documentary also embraces the controversies that shook the Panthers. Most rank and file party members were women, for instance, but they were still treated like second-class citizens. \nAs Ericka Huggins, a founding member of the party who now teaches at Oakland’s Merritt College puts it, “We were making history, and it wasn’t nice and clean. It wasn’t easy. It was complex.” \nNelson also doesn’t shy away from the ways in which the structure of the party fed its internal strife, fueled its chaos and demoralized its followers. Fissures between the charismatic leaders at the top, such as Newton and Eldridge Cleaver, further destabilized the movement. The documentary charts the fall of the party without getting bogged down in tedious detail. \nTo be sure, the power of this nuanced and insightful film goes deeper than its recitation of the facts, through archival footage and candid interviews. “Black Panther” conjures up the spirit of the civil rights era with insight and emotion. The documentary connects the past and the present so forcefully that we see our own reflection in the struggle to bring power to the people.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:32:33.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
