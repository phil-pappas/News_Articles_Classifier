The dump truck is called in to help, and when an avalanche buries it and knocks some boulders lose, it’s time for the snowplow’s hard work and preparation to shine. \nIn a story reminiscent of “The Little Engine That Could,” Koehler shares lessons about not giving up when others around you don’t believe, being ready and working hard. Parker’s pencil drawings give each of the trucks personality, especially the little, determined snowplow. \nIf you go ... \nWhat: Storytime with Lora Koehler and Jake Parker \nWhen: Saturday, Oct. 24, 11 a.m. \nWhere: The King's English Bookshop, 1511 S. 1500 East, Salt Lake City \nWeb: kingsenglish.com \nNote: Places in the signing line are reserved for those who purchase a copy of the featured book from The King's English.
