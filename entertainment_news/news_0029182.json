News: ''I'm really proud of her. I think it's something that needs to be spoken about especially in that community. The industry seems to be changing for models, and it's great that she can have a voice.'' \nThe blonde beauty felt the need to defend her hourglass frame after people attacked her for being out of shape during recent catwalk shows in Milan, Italy and New York. \nAnd Gigi previously admitted that negative comments started to affect her confidence and she began to believe the critics. \nShe explained: ''There are people who feel like they're able to hide behind their usernames and their private accounts, who feel like they can say whatever they want and it won't affect anyone. I try not to pay attention to it that much, but it got to a point where I started to feel self-conscious about certain things - in the way that I felt that my walk, for example, is unique and I also felt like I needed to improve it.'' \nGigi took to her social networking site to state she was ''proud'' of her sexy body and wouldn't let some nasty comments affect her blossoming career within the industry.
