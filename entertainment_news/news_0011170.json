The Time Jumpers, featuring Country Music Hall of Famer Vince Gill and musician Kenny Sears, are set to perform a mix of covers and original songs. Through the past several decades, Sears performed alongside classic country’s top singers, from Mel Tillis to the late Dottie West. The Time Jumpers primarily perform Western swing music. For those with tickets to the Shelby show, it’s an opportunity to see the group up close. Sears said the group typically performs at venues seating 2,000-2,500 people. “Everyone is so seasoned and such great musicians. They all know what to do and what a pleasure that is. There is just no dead weight in the show. Everyone is contributing something. It’s just pure total enjoyment to be on stage with these guys,” Sears said. Here’s what Sears has to say about Vince Gill, performing in Cleveland County, and his favorite country music singers. On what you can expect at the show “Most of the time you have one star out front and a backup band. Our show is a little bit different. We have 10 stars on stage, all contributing to each other. Everybody takes their turn at the mic and whoever’s at the mic has nine people at their back supporting them. It’s a wonderful thing. It’s not like anything you’ve probably seen before.” On touring with Vince Gill “Vince is such a sweetheart. He is such a nice, nice man. He fits into this band like you just couldn’t believe. You wouldn’t expect that because he’s such a big star, a household name and all of that. But when he comes out with us, he’s one of the guitar players, he’s one of the singers, and he’s one of the writers. What a very talented man.” On contemporary country music “My favorite music is the traditional kind of country, the old Western swing. I got to Nashville early enough to do that kind of music and make those kind of records. I like what the kids are doing now, it’s just not as much my cup of tea.” On The Time Jumpers’ songwriting “We’ve all been writing and the things that we write are very reminiscent of memories from the ‘30s and ‘40s, the big band era. We write in that genre most of the time. Even though they’re new songs, they sound like they could have been written back then.” Page 2 of 2 - On performing at the Don Gibson Theatre “It’s a very nice venue. I love that place. It’s a good place to play. We like that kind of venue. We like having the audience in our lap and that’s one of those venues. We don’t play a lot of those anymore… We love it when we come into a small place like the Don Gibson Theatre and we feel like the crowd is on the stage with us.” On his favorite music “It just depends on whatever mood, you know. I really do favor the old Bob Wills classics. I like those songs. I like them because of the opportunity they present to play and stretch out. That kind of music is largely based on improvisation and that’s so much more fun to play than something that has to be cut and dry, and done the same way every night. We don’t do too much to that. The songs that we do, we may do some of the same songs every night but we don’t do them the same way.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:08:23.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
