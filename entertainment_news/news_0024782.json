The \"I Need a Dollar\" singer's wife, Australian rapper Maya Jupiter, is pregnant with their second child. The unborn baby would join big sister Mandela. \"Baby No. 2 on the way!\" Blacc told Us Weekly at Los Angeles' 44th Humanitarian Awards on Friday, October 16. \"According to the doctor, it's a boy, so hopefully they are right. We had a girl at first.\" Mandela was born in September 2013 and was named after African leader Nelson Mandela. \"She's actually really thriving through this pregnancy. This is awesome,\" Blacc added. Speaking of her cravings, he said, \"Just pickles. It wasn't crazy like last time. Nutella was one of her favorites.\" On whether or not he sings to the unborn child, Blacc said, \"All the time. There's so much music in the house all the time, there's no way to escape it.\" Underneath his success as a musician, Blacc had been enjoying his role as a father. \"It's been wonderful,\" he told Daily Mail last year. \"The beautiful thing is that my wife is a champion. She lets me sleep when I need to. But I definitely help out as much as I can. I've changed plenty of nappies!\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T05:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T10:45:04.462+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
