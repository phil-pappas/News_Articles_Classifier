Gothard, 80, of LaGrange, has not been charged with any wrongdoing and has publicly denied committing any acts of sexual misconduct.\nGothard resigned last year amid accusations that he had acted improperly with young women. The institute conducted an internal probe in 2014 but, according to the lawsuit, it was a \"sham investigation\" that found no criminal wrongdoing and did not include interviews with any of the five women who are now suing. The investigation was \"preordained and nothing more than a cover-up,\" the lawsuit states.\nThe lawsuit Quote: s from an earlier IBLP statement: \"At this point, based upon those willing to be interviewed, no criminal activity has been discovered. It if had been, it would have been reported to the proper authorities immediately, as it will be in the future if any such activity is revealed. ... However, the review showed that Mr. (Bill) Gothard has acted in an inappropriate manner, and the board realizes the seriousness of his lack of discretion and failure to follow Christ's example of being blameless and above reproach.\"\nSince Gothard founded the institute in 1961, millions of people have attended his seminars on how to improve their lives by following rules from the Bible. His empire includes the not-for-profit organization, which is dedicated to conservative family values and religious research, and the Advanced Training Institute, which developed a popular home-schooling curriculum, as well as a prison ministry and other outreaches worldwide.\nFollowers include Michelle and Jim Bob Duggar, stars of the now-canceled reality TV show \"19 Kids and Counting.\" In an interview with the Tribune last month, Gothard said the institute also operated the Little Rock Ark., facility where the Duggars' eldest son, Josh, went as a teenager after admitting that he sexually abused his younger sisters.\nAfter Josh Duggar sexually abused sisters, family turned to local institute Manya Brachear Pashman The home schooling curriculum used by Michelle and Jim Bob Duggar, stars of the now-canceled reality TV show \"19 Kids and Counting,\" came from the Oak Brook-based Institute in Basic Life Principles, whose founder resigned last year amid accusations of sexual misconduct.\nFounder Bill Gothard said...\nThe home schooling curriculum used by Michelle and Jim Bob Duggar, stars of the now-canceled reality TV show \"19 Kids and Counting,\" came from the Oak Brook-based Institute in Basic Life Principles, whose founder resigned last year amid accusations of sexual misconduct.\nFounder Bill Gothard said...\n(Manya Brachear Pashman) Josh Duggar, 27, resigned in May from his position as executive director of FRC Action, the public face of the conservative Family Research Council, shortly after reports of the earlier alleged misconduct as a teen came to light. He also had appeared on the reality TV show, which the TLC network canceled in July.\nThe five women who filed the DuPage County lawsuit now live out of state and are identified as Gretchen Wilkinson, Charis Barker, Rachel Frost, Rachel Lees and \"Jane Doe.\" They are seeking at least $50,000 each in damages for each claim of action, which include allegations of negligence and conspiracy, according to the lawsuit.\nSome of the women have spoken out publicly on the whistleblowing website, Recovering Grace, which according to its online profile is dedicated to helping those affected by the teachings of Gothard, the Institute in Basic Life Principles and the Advanced Training Institute.\nBesides the institute, named as defendants are its current board of directors: John Stancil, Anthony Burrus, Gil Bates, Timothy Levendusky, Stephen Paine and David York.\nA spokesperson for the institute could not be immediately reached for comment.\nThe lawsuit, filed Monday, has a Jan. 19 court date in Wheaton.\ncmgutowski@tribpub.com\nTwitter @christygutowsk1\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-55f204d1/turbine/ct-josh-duggar-home-school-basic-life-principles-met-20150910", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56292d92/turbine/ct-dupage-ministry-lawsuit-met-20151022-thumbnail", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562935c4/turbine/ct-pdf-institute-in-basic-life-principals-lawsuit-20151022"], "published": "2015-10-22T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:15:09.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
