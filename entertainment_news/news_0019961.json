Fairly recently, our dog developed a soft, round growth in his left elbow. We typically go to a low-cost clinic, and they did a needle aspirate and suggested that it was a soft tissue mass and that we should probably have it removed. We took our dog to a local vet, and they agreed, telling us that while it could be a fatty growth, the needle aspirate suggested something potentially more serious. We are contemplating surgical removal and wonder what suggestions you might give us as to the possibilities and success rate given the dog’s age and breed. Should we be concerned, and how much time would we have if we do nothing now? Our concerns are cost and prognosis. Thanks. — S.V.\nDear S.V.,\nLet me start by saying that unfortunately you are correct in identifying the boxer as a breed prone to cancers in general. I grew up with a boxer, love the breed, and know their predisposition all too well.\nMy rule of thumb in boxers is that if a growth pops up after the age of 6 or 7 that it be addressed by removal and biopsy as soon as possible. This increases the rate of survival substantially. If a needle aspirate of a growth located on the front leg as you described sug­gested anything possible other than fat as found in a lipoma, then I would be concerned and would suggest that you do not have much time to waste in making a decision to remove it.\nThe tumors I find in this area are usually mesenchymal tumors or soft-tissue sarcomas such as nerve sheath tumors and fibrosarcomas. Removal is difficult given the inability to obtain broad margins of excision and the permeation of these masses into surrounding tissue even when they appear well encapsulated in surgery. If my hunch is correct, these surgeries end up becoming debulking procedures that help the dog with preventing discomfort or lameness in the short term but often recur locally. I would make haste to have the growth removed and biopsied and, if malignant, then seek the counsel of an oncologist for follow-up chemotherapy or radiation if warranted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:05:42.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
