Featured in the new issue of Entertainment Weekly magazine, the pictures highlight Daniel Craig 's Bond and Lea Seydoux 's Dr. Madeleine Swann in action while they try to extinguish the titular evil organization. One of the photos finds Bond and Swann weaving through the crowded streets of Tangiers to track down Spectre. The 007 agent is also seen among people wearing costumes during the Day of the Dead festival in Mexico City. There is also a glimpse at Marco Sciarra (Alessandro Cremona), an Italian hitman, who gives Bond some trouble in the city. As the mission continues, the British superspy is seen piloting a plane before he eventually walks out of the wrecked plane to shoot enemies. Aside from the action sequences, another photo shows Bond seducing Lucia Sciarra ( Monica Bellucci ) in a hotel room to infiltrate Spectre.

Craig hugged Waltz as he pretended to fall asleep on the English actor's shoulder. Craig is joined by the likes of Ben Whishaw , Ralph Fiennes and Dave Bautista in the cast.
