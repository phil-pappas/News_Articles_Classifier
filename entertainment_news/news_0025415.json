Photo by Rob Carr/Getty Images When you think about the Cleveland Browns and the Denver Broncos, two phrases come to mind, 'The Drive' and 'The Fumble.' Browns fans have been waiting for almost 30 years to erase those phrases from their memory banks, but it just won't go away. Those two phrases lead the Broncos to back to back Super Bowl appearances and are two of many heartbreaking moments for the long suffering championship starved sports fans in Cleveland.\nIt's been nearly as long since the Browns were victorious against the Broncos. Bud Carson is the last Browns head coach to lead Cleveland to a victory over Denver back in 1990. For more proof as to how long it has been since Cleveland beat Denver in football, current Browns linebacker Barkevious Mingo was four days old the last time that happened.\nThe Browns are coming off their second win of the season, an emotional 33-30 overtime victory against the division rival Ravens in Baltimore. Denver is undefeated at 5-0 but not because of their offense, lead by future hall of fame quarterback Peyton Manning . The Broncos defense is currently number one in the NFL and will put pressure on the quarterback, control opposing teams running games and are solid against the pass. Head coach Mike Pettine and his staff are in agreement that this is the toughest defense they will see so far.\n“Yeah that’s a fair statement. The statistics back it up, I think they’re number one overall. They’ve played at a high level,\" Pettine said. \"I talked about it yesterday just, fundamentally sound. They do some good things scheme wise. They don’t do a ton but they don’t have to. They’re so good at what they do but they do all – I always talk about the little things and this is a team you really get deep into the film, they do a lot of little things well.”\nThe Browns will get a break as the Broncos will be without all pro defensive end DeMarcus Ware because of a back injury . The Broncos still have their other pass rushing specialist in Von Miller healthy and ready to get pressure on Josh McCown on Sunday.\n\"Von Miller is an exceptional, exceptional player,\" McCown said. \"All across the board, that is the thing with them. Sometimes, from week to week you look at a group on the field that you feel you can attack, whether it is the front, the linebackers the secondary. You don’t have that. You go to the next group and golly, they are good, too. You move to the next group. I think what makes them unique is that they are good outside, too. Typically, you have great pass rushers and they make up for lack of stability outside or whatever. These guys are good outside, and they are good with pass rush. We will have our hands full. We understand that. We are putting together a good game plan, but it will take a good week’s worth to be prepared for these guys.”\n“The explosiveness. He has a great get-off. His reaction time to the ball being snapped. If a tackle is slow out of his stance – that is one of the reasons we are glad we have them at home,\" Pettine said. \"If you play them there you are in trouble when the tackle and him are getting off at the same time on a silent count. It is a touch easier at home when you know the snap count and he doesn’t. It starts with that. He is very good with his hands. He has a great sense for how tackles are setting him. If he gets under set then he can dip and bend the edge better than most I have ever seen. Then if he gets over set, whether he spins inside or rips across and comes underneath. He just has a great feel for when to turn the corner and when to come underneath. They do a good job schematically that they protect him either way. Any great pass rusher you want to give them a two-way go and they do that for him and he is exceptional.”\nSunday's game will be very important for former Browns and current Broncos safety T.J. Ward. The Browns decided to not resign their second round pick from the 2010 draft following the 2013 season and going for the hometown kid Donte Whitner instead at safety. Ward who was named the AFC defensive player of the week just two weeks ago told members of the media via a conference call this week that he wanted to come back to Cleveland but felt the organization didn't want him back. Ward will look to have a big game against his former team on Sunday.\n“I play with a chip on my shoulder. You guys have seen me on a daily basis. Week to week, I have a chip. I’m trying to make this my next big game,” Ward said. “It’s definitely going to be some feelings there for sure, being on the other side and being familiar with the team, the city the players. I don’t really know what to expect, but I hope it’s a little bit of open arms, but I know I’m going to get some boos when I start making plays.”\nThe Browns defense will a tough task on Sunday as well despite the struggles the Broncos have had on offense this season. Manning is still one of the best quarterbacks of this generation and has two outstanding receivers to throw to in Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders. The Broncos have struggled running the football, but with the passing game Denver possessions, the Browns need to bring their best game on defense to end the long losing streak against the Broncos\n“You have those two guys (Broncos WR Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders), a good tight end with a great quarterback behind center is always going be a challenge to anybody,\" cornerback Tramon Williams said. \"We are up for the challenge at this point. We feel that we can go in there and win a game. We are not going to come in saying, ‘This is a really, really great team and that is the way we are going to approach it.’ Yeah, that is a great team, but we also have some great players, too. We are going to go in and compete.”\n“You have to have confidence in what we are doing and execute,\" linebacker Karlos Dansby said. \"That is it. It is about executing. I think we are a confident group, period.”\nSome people feel that Manning is starting to decline as an NFL quarterback based on the season he is having in 2015. Manning is running a new offense under first year head coach Gary Kubiak, but don't tell the Browns number 18 is on the decline.\n“Yeah it is definitely a player in this league that carries a lot of respect. A guy you know if you don’t bring your ‘A’ game that he is going to be able to hurt you in a number of ways,\" linebacker Paul Kruger said. \"We are dialed in. Our focus is to put together a nice gameplan for him and be ready physically and mentally. A lot of respect comes with that.”\n“It is awesome. Honestly, it is probably one of the games I have been looking forward to,\" defensive tackle Danny Shelton said. \"I have always been a fan of Peyton Manning. Listening to these guys in the locker room talk about him. Des Bryant he got a sack against him before. I was jealous. It is pretty cool because the guy has been in the league for 18 years and he is still playing at a high level. I am just excited to be out there competing against him.”\nThe Browns will be very shorthanded in the secondary as they try to slow down Manning and the Broncos passing game. Pro bowlers Joe Haden and Tashaun Gipson have been ruled out for the game. Haden is still the the NFL's protocol for concussions. Gipson is battling an ankle injury.\n“Yeah, that’s tough to have two guys that are Pro Bowl guys not out there for you, but we’re confident in the depth in the room, and we’ve gotten a lot of quality reps with those guys,\" Pettine said. \"I thought Jordan Poyer stepped up last week and played very well, got a game ball against Baltimore. Pierre Desir's done some good things and he’s relentless in his preparation. It’s never ideal when you’re down guys, but you’re confident in the depth and how those guys prepare.”\nThe Browns will also be without linebacker Craig Robertson for a second straight game. Robertson is also battling an ankle injury. McCown suffered an ankle injury late in last weeks win at Baltimore but will be fine and will start at quarterback\nKickoff at FirstEnergy Stadium is at 1:00 p.m. The game will be broadcast on CBS. Ian Eagle will have the play by play. Dan Fouts will provide the color commentary with Evan Washburn reporting on the sidelines. Compass media networks will provide a national radio broadcast of the game with Chris Carrino on the play by play and Brian Baldinger serving as the color analyst. The Browns radio network crew of Jim Donovan, Doug Dieken and Nathan Zegura will broadcast the game to its affiliates throughout the buckeye state. The Browns will wear their brown jerseys with the white pants for the game.", "external_links": ["http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/news/article-5/Four-Downs-For-Browns-there%E2%80%99s-something-different-about-facing-Peyton-Manning/4bbfc9cc-799b-4cbf-a0bc-b86f187591b6", "http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_28980933/demarcus-ware-understands-approach-back-injury-says-its", "https://twitter.com/Browns/status/655045404183031809"], "published": "2015-10-18T07:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:21:59.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
