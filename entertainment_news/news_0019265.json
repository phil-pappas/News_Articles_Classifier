The figures are collected and reported every two years under state statute and federal guidelines.\nIn the fall of 2012, District 60 unveiled the Rise Above anti-bullying a program, which was developed in conjunction with the Lake County State's Attorney's office and subsequently adopted by other districts as well.\n\"Our bullying curriculum is taught in P.E. classes. For us, bullying is on the decline after the program was implemented,\" Newby said.\nBullying cases are categorized as a pattern of behavior that continues over a period of time and impacts a student's inclination or ability to come to school, Newby said, as opposed to one-time confrontations or fights.\nUnder the District 60 School Board's policy on bullying, the act includes, but is not limited to, conduct such as harassment, threats, intimidation, stalking, public humiliation and physical violence.\nOne of the most effective anti-bullying tools, Newby said, is the anonymous tip line for students. Both school and law enforcement officials reported that anonymous options have provided a breakthrough in getting students involved in helping others who are being bullied without becoming targets themselves.\nDistrict 68 sets up tip line to report problems in schools Mike Isaacs Skokie School District 68 has added a new Safety Tip Line to its website in an effort to stop bullying and other at-risk behaviors in its schools, the district announced this week.\n\"The Tip Line is designed for use as an online reporting and prevention tool,\" the district stated in a note that...\nSkokie School District 68 has added a new Safety Tip Line to its website in an effort to stop bullying and other at-risk behaviors in its schools, the district announced this week.\n\"The Tip Line is designed for use as an online reporting and prevention tool,\" the district stated in a note that...\n(Mike Isaacs) When the district receives a tip that bullying is taking place in a certain hall location or on a specific bus, teachers or staff are assigned to monitor the location, Newby said. The effort has cut into the ability of bullies to operate on district property, Newby said.\nSome students have also become more willing to speak out publicly against bullying when it occurs, he said.\nMany Waukegan schools pass out \"I Pledge to Rise Above\" wristbands, which in addition to getting students to reflect on their own behavior, sends a public notice to bullies when worn by other students.\nThe variety of acts that can constitute bullying, however, continues to make tracking actual incidents difficult, according to Carrie Flanigan, special programs manager in the state's attorney's office.\nFlanigan said that is primarily because juvenile charges such as battery, which can constitute bullying when repeated, can also be the result of singular incidents not tied to bullying.\nFlanigan and Claudia Kasten, chief of the juvenile trial division for the state's attorney's office, both noted that there are currently no countywide statistics on bullying available due to the difficulty in tracking charges such as juvenile battery that may or may not be the result of bullying.\n\"What we see is the bullying that gets elevated to criminal charges. But we do believe the preventative efforts are making a noticeable difference,\" Kasten said, adding that several agencies and offices, including the Regional Superintendent of Schools Office, are working together to promote more inclusive discussions on the issue. \"One of the important things is that we are able to talk about it in the community, not just to school officials and students, but to parents and the community (to stress the importance of) modeling good behavior.\"\nCommentary: What do you teach your kids about bullying?

But we have to understand that if we don't know what's causing the offender to act out, we will not be successful in stopping the behavior.\"\nThe widespread acceptance of programs such as Rise Above, the involvement of groups such as the Lake County Juvenile Justice Council, which helps provide resources and guidelines for dealing with bullying, and the establishment of tools such as anonymous tip lines are being credited with reining in bullying in Lake County.\n\"I definitely think the programs are having an effect,\" Flanigan said. \"Each school is required to have a program and that in itself is big. The more we are able to talk about it, and bring it to the forefront, the better off these kids will be.\"\njrnewton@tribpub.com\nTwitter @jimnewton5\nUnity Day\nOn Wednesday, nations around the world are observing Unity Day, an event developed by PACER's National Bullying Prevention Center to show support for preventing bullying in schools, neighborhoods and online.\nHundreds of Unity Day events are planned in the United States, and the effort is now recognized around the world with students and organizations participating in activities.\nOrganizers have encouraged supporters to wear orange Wednesday in recognition of the bullying problem and efforts to combat it.\nUnity Day began in 2011 as part of National Bullying Prevention Month, which was launched by PACER in 2006.\nPACER has created a Unity Day Facebook event that people can \"attend\" and share, as well as a cover photo that individuals can post on their personal Facebook pages.
