A new partnership with Dockwa , an award-winning unified booking and marketing platform that greatly simplifies the transient slip booking process, now allows BoatUS members to find and book a slip with just a few taps on the Dockwa app – a seamless and secure process that streamlines communication and payment via an innovative digital platform that no longer requires reservations via email or phone. As an exclusive BoatUS benefit, members using the Dockwa app or choosing to book online at Dockwa.com do not have to pay booking fees when arranging dockage at any of the BoatUS Participating Marinas when a discount is applicable, within the growing Dockwa network. This member perk is in addition to the exclusive BoatUS Participating Marina transient slip discount currently offered to BoatUS members, typically 25%. When signing up for the first time with Dockwa, all BoatUS members have to do is enter their membership number and both discounts are automatically applied to future bookings.\n“This is the most convenient way for our members to book their transient reservations for docks and moorings,” said BoatUS Vice President of Membership Heather Lougheed. “No waiting for a call back, no voicemail or web forms to fill out. Just tap the Dockwa app, book and dock. You don’t even have to bring your wallet as payment is automated. If weather causes you to change your plans, it can be done with Dockwa’s easy messaging feature.”\nThe ease and convenience of the Dockwa platform has been positively received by early adopters within the marina and boating community. \"Dockwa is the only mobile reservation service that really listened to our concerns,” said Tom Cox, General Manager and owner of the Constitution Marina in Boston, Massachusetts. “They have the technical know-how and the business acumen to make this next generation of marina software a success.\"\nLaunched in May of 2015 in the New England region, the entrepreneurial team of eight rapidly expanded down the Eastern Seaboard with a growing network of over 175 marinas from Maine to the Bahamas. The platform has already begun west coast expansion with plans to expand to further develop to other parts of the country later this year.\nAdditional benefits for marina managers through the Dockwa platform include a user-friendly web-based dashboard that lets operators review and confirm reservation requests, customer relationship tools, management capabilities and an easy and secure method for collecting payment. The ability to aggregate and store customer information into an online database also creates opportunity to optimize operations and boost traffic and revenue.\nFor more information, go to http://www.Dockwa.com .\n###\nAbout Boat Owners Association of The United States (BoatUS):\nBoatUS is the nation’s largest organization of recreational boaters with over a half million members.
