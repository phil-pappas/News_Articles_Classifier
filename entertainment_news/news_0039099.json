Kettering artist Lucille Carroll, who visited the new residence home this past July, wanted the inside to be as grand as the outside. Her son works at the VA in Salisbury, North Carolina. So, she collaborated with The Fine Art Center’s artists to donate works to liven up the walls.\n“I’ve wanted to do something for the veterans for some time. I had read the article about Lyons Place II, new VA low-income housing, and asked about putting artwork up,” said Carroll, one of the founding members of The Fine Art Center, that relocated one year ago from Kettering to Centerville.\nShari Hoosier, a building administrator, thought that was a wonderful idea. There are now 40 works inside the building by 16 different artists; four of the pieces were created by Carroll. The artist, who has a heart for helping, also teaches art classes there every Wednesday at 11 a.m. One of her students is Sarah Burge.\n“I think it’s lovely, it looks lively and pretty in the lounge and in the hallways, and people are excited about the building and ask where we got the art,” said Burge. “I’ve taken classes in watercolor, color pencil, paint, crayon, chalk. She has something for everyone’s different taste.”\nAnd that also applies to the art in the building. There are landscapes, photography, and macro florals. In the pool, or billiard, room, the works reflect a sport-loving atmosphere with football players and duck hunters. The foyer in front has one of Carroll’s paintings of a sunflower field with an American flag, very appropriate for honoring veterans.\nLyons Place was officially opened with a ribbon cutting ceremony June 29. The independent living quarters, with one- and two-bedroom apartments, was built on Veterans Administration grounds for seniors 62 and older.\n“Lucille brought up this idea at one of our monthly meetings. Her generosity and perseverance in carrying out not only this project, but both of our Red Paper Workshop series, really verifies her charitable kindness, work ethic, and dedication to our not-for-profit endeavors,” said TFAC artist Mary Clifford. “Lucille is a real asset to The Fine Art Center.”\nMore News From Our News Partners Chick-fil-A's 'free food for life' offer stirs controversy NFL players avoid arrests for an entire month Photos: 4 top toy trends for holiday shoppers Must-see: Four-legged 'traffic jam' stops drivers A reporter drops the mic - in a Sousaphone", "external_links": ["http://host.coxmediagroup.com/cop/digital/sites/common/js/cmgo_right_rail_addons.js\\", "http://www.news965.com/news/business/chick-fil-s-free-food-life-offer-has-people-furiou/nnsjp/", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/908/img/photos/2015/09/30/aa/c7/BurgeVA\\u002DLyons\\u002DPlace\\u002DII.jpg", "http://www.fox23.com/news/news/weird-news/reporter-drops-mic-sousaphone/nns7z/", "http://www.news965.com/news/sports/football/nfl-players-avoid-arrests-entire-month/nns7j/?xeknC3", "http://www.fox23.com/gallery/lifestyles/holiday/photos-4-top-toy-trends-holiday-shoppers/gCXLZ/", "http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:16:40.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
