These operators from 20 countries will climb from 75% of Asia Pacific pay TV subscribers in 2014 to 83% by 2020.\nThe Asia Pacific Pay TV Operator Forecasts report concludes that China and India dominate the operator rankings by subscribers. Government policy to consolidate cable TV operations means that China Radio & TV has become the world's largest pay TV operator by a long way, with 198 million subscribers by end-2014. The operator will soon represent every cable TV home in China , with 252 million subscribers expected by 2020 â€“ up by nearly 54 million on 2014.\nAt the other end of the scale, Korea's CJ Hellovision will lose 827,000 subscribers over the same period. In fact, nine operators are expected to experience subscriber decreases between 2014 and 2020.\nTotal subscription and VOD revenues for the 68 operators will climb by nearly $10 billion between 2014 and 2020 to $33 billion . These operators will account for 80% of Asia Pacific pay TV revenues by 2020, up from 74% in 2014.\nThe dominance of China and India is diminished when the operators are ranked in revenue terms [subscriptions and VOD only]. China Radio & TV will add a massive $2.16 billion between 2014 and 2020. In fact, five operators will add more than $500 million in revenues. However, 10 operators will lose revenues, with Foxtel (down by $151 million ) declining by the most.\nPublished in September 2015 , this 124-page electronically-delivered report comes in two parts:\n- A 98-page PDF giving a global executive summary, operator analysis, country-by-country analysis and forecasts.\n- An excel workbook giving comparison tables and country-by-country forecasts in detail for 68 operators across 20 territories for every year from 2010 to 2020.\nRead the full report: http://www.reportlinker.com/p03299568-summary/view-report.html\nAbout Reportlinker\nReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.
