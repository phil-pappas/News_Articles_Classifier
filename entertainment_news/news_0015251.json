With all the bad news — the weather, a plane crash in Afghanistan, the current crop of office-seeking politicians and their never-ending gaffs — his “news glory” has been severely cut short.\nNine years ago, almost to the day, my daughter, Lizzy Hafter, UVA COL ’06, was murdered. Her murderer, along with this most current murderer in Oregon, was mad at the world. Both killers had easy access to weapons.\nMy daughter’s murderer wrote entries on his social media page for over a month, ranting about how the world had done him wrong, how he had been repeatedly disrespected, how he deserved much better, how he would get back at the world. This current murderer wrote a multiple page manifesto with similar themes. No one took notice. No one notified law enforcement, mental health agencies or physicians.\nMy daughter’s murderer was “living with” his estranged/ex-wife. From all accounts, they showed no means of financial income. However, a “respected” businessman, without doing any research or background checks, allowed these strangers to live with him in his home for over a month. This Oregon murderer lived with his mother, same abode. How could she not know of his amassing of weapons and ammunition? Her lack of responsible behavior, no matter the reasoning, enabled his continued behavior and its down spiraling developments.\nMy daughter’s murderer’s host kept an unsecured, loaded weapon in plain view within the common living spaces. He knew his car was “missing” before he entered his home. He knew almost immediately that the loaded, unsecured weapon was gone. He knew who took them. This was 10 days before my daughter, No. 8 attributed to that gun, was murdered. Yet, his words, he wanted to give this killer the benefit of the doubt. So he did not report either the gun or the car missing/stolen.\nThe only mention of the Oregon murderer’s mother recalls her mentioning his “strange” behavior to a neighbor, but no further securing of advice or help.\nThe most recent murders did not take place in a gun-free zone. Concealed weapons are legally permitted on campus. If more guns were the answer, why has Australia been so successful in eliminating the mass carnage?\nIt’s time to stop drinking the NRA Kool-Aid. It’s past time to take some real action.\nThe Second Amendment is not omnipotent. It, along with all the other amendments, can be restricted. Responsibility is not excused by our Constitution or any of its amendments. Tell your elected officials to sponsor Lizzy’s Law.\nJOANNE HAFTER\nColumbia, S.C.\nIt’s deja vu with John Boehner\nSinger Kenny Rogers said on the Today Show that he was calling it quits after his next world tour and went on to explain that the lyrics in his hit song “The Gambler” were not about gambling at the writing of that song, but more about his take on life.\nNot at the same time, Kenny is talking about “knowing when to hold... knowing when to walk away,” John Boehner is down the highway throwing in his towel. All this time, the pope is swirling in the background, as well he should, pushing us all to higher living.\nAs the late singer Marvin Gaye said in his blockbuster hit for Motown Records, “What’s Going On?” Or maybe Teena Maria said it all in her song, “De Ja Vu.” I’ve been here before.\nSo maybe John Boehner was here before as an Abe Lincoln-type Speaker of the House, this time set to the music of Kenny Rogers with the pope as Preacher of the House.\nSYLVESTER A. KEMP\nA D.C. Retiree\nSavannah\nHave you lost your mind, Mayor Jackson?\nI guess I should have gone to a recent meeting from what was posted by the mayor on the words of “Take our city back? What to segregation?” Have you lost your everlasting mind? I used to like you. However, more and more, it’s getting less and less.\nI was not going to vote for you this term anyway, but that comment was untrue. I would have stood up and educated you on some facts.\nThat was the dumbest statement out of Mayor Edna Jackson I have ever heard. “Take our city back? What to segregation?” is meant to take it back from the thugs. Now I do wish I had gone, as I would have definitely stood up to correct you, Mayor Jackson. It doesn’t matter if your skin color is green, purple or teal; we need to stop these senseless shootings and killings.\nEMBEE-MARIE McDANIEL\nSavannah\nTo the unappreciated: I will always be there for you\nIn the midst of all of the crime, accidents, sickness and death we deal with in our city, it breaks my heart to see our public safety personnel go unappreciated. We hear on the news the tragedies in our communities, but those that have to pick up the pieces go about their jobs 24/7, not asking anything in return.\nLaw enforcement personnel are expected to be perfect. They have to make split second decisions about life and death and no matter what decision they make, someone will be offended by the outcome.\nOur fire and EMS personnel work long hours with little sleep, helping the sick and injured, placing their lives on the line, not knowing if they will go home.\nOur medical personnel, in the emergency department, are constantly dealing with the sick. Everyone wants their problem to be the most important.\nI see the tears, the frustration and the missed family time. I also see the satisfaction that comes from saving someone from harm, from putting out a fire to save family treasures, and helping the sick, injured and comforting those who morn.\nTo my brothers and sisters in law enforcement, thank you for keeping me and my family safe as I sleep each night. To my brother and sister firefighters, thank you for allowing me to sleep soundly knowing I am protected from the danger of fire and smoke. To my brothers and sisters in EMS, thank you for the endless nights in which you treat the sick and injured. To the dispatchers, I know you feel helpless, because you can’t actually see those you help, but you comfort them and help us get there to help. To the emergency room personnel, thank you for being there to comfort and help heal.\nYou are my family. I appreciate you. If you ever need to know you are important, let me know. I will be there for you.\nDALE SIMMONS\nParamedic/Firefighter/Chaplain\nSavannah", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-12T18:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:06:23.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
