She stars as Supergirl, the cousin of that \"other\" caped crusader from Krypton. When she's not kicking bad-guy butt, she works as an assistant to media mogul Cat Grant (Calista Flockhart). 8:30 p.m. Monday, CBS. \n* Wicked City — Set in 1982, the new drama series follows two detectives hunting a serial killer who preys on young, naive women seeking fame in Los Angeles. The cast includes Jeremy Sisto, Ed Eastwick and Gabriel Luna. 10 p.m. Tuesday, ABC. \n* Ash vs. Evil Dead — Break out the chain saw. Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell), the super-sauve, dimwitted, self-centered, one-handed monster fighter, is back in action on Halloween, and he's just groovy, baby. This 10-episode revival of Sam Raimi's beloved tongue-in-cheek horror franchise finds Ash lying low, working as a stock boy and living in a trailer. Soon he'll have to face his demons — \"personal and literal.\" 9 p.m. Saturday, Starz. \nSeason debut: \n* Grimm — As season five begins, Nick (David Giuntoli) is in a major funk, and who can blame him? His mother was beheaded; Juliette died; and his once sworn enemy, Adalind (Claire Coffee), is pregnant with his child. 9 p.m. Friday, NBC. \n* The Returned — The wait is over. Season two of the creepy-good French series finally brings us back to the small mountain town where residents who were presumed dead come back to life — without all the yucky zombie makeup. 10 p.m. Saturday, Sundance TV. \nWorth watching: \n* Black-ish — Looks like Halloween could be more trick than treat for Dre (Anthony Anderson). His big, buffed-up cousin (guest star Michael Strahan), who used to torment him as a kid, makes a surprise visit. 9:31 p.m. Wednesday, ABC. \n* Bones — The crew shares some frightful crossover fun with \"Sleepy Hollow,\" as Abbie Mills (Nicole Beharie) and Ichabod Crane (Tom Mison) get involved with the Jeffersonian team probing a case pegged to a 200-year-old headless corpse. 8 p.m. Thursday, Fox. \n— From news service reports © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T13:26:51.215+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
