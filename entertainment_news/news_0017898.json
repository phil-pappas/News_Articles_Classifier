However, the young actor refutes the claims.\n\"I will be playing an important character in the movie but it won't be as Moothapa's (Mammootty) brother,\" he explains. \"My role is crucial to the story but I am not at liberty to reveal the details right now.\"\nThe yet-to-be-titled movie is set to go on floors by January first week. Meanwhile, Maqbool has finished shooting for two films - Dooram and Appuram Bengal Eppuram Thiruvathamkoor . The former will see him play a college student sharing screen with Dubai-based twins Aima and Aina.\n\" Dooram will show two phases of my character's life and it's a fun movie,\" he says. His second movie, which also has actors Unni Rajan P Dev and Ansiba Hassan, will have him play another youngster and will tell the tale of friendships.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:29:15.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
