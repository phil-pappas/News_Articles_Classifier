If the region were a state, it would rank 33rd in GDP – just ahead of Nevada.\nInland Southern California’s robust economic expansion is attributable in no small part to taxable sales growth that surpasses Los Angeles and Orange counties. Indeed, the region saw a 5.4 percent increase in taxable sales during the first quarter of 2015, compared to 3.3 percent for L.A. County and 1.1 percent for Orange County.\nAnd Dr. Levine and his colleagues at the Center for Economic Forecasting and Development foresee continued growth in taxable sales for Inland Southern California, forecasting an average rate of 6.5 percent over the next five years.\nThe region’s jobs picture is similarly promising, with non-farm employment reaching an all-time high this past July, and the unemployment rate declining to 6.4 percent. While joblessness remains 0.2 percent above the statewide rate, that is a considerable improvement over the 2 percent differential in December 2009.\nAnd what bears watching is the evolution of Inland Southern California’s job market.\nIndeed, the transportation and warehouse sector, “a bread-and-butter industry for the region,” the center reaffirmed, continues to add new positions to company payrolls – growing a robust 9.8 percent from July 2014 to July 2015.\nBut following closely was the professional, scientific and technical services sector, which grew its labor force by an impressive 9.4 percent for the year ending this past July.\nSuch jobs, which include legal services, accounting, architecture, engineering, computer systems design, scientific research and development and other high-skill, high-wage occupations, generally are not associated with Inland Southern California by those unfamiliar with the region.\nBut that’s old think about a region that, as Dr. Levine said, “has gotten a bad rap.” One that no longer is the sick man of California, but “a growth engine for the entire state.”\nWRITE A LETTER TO THE EDITOR: Letters to the Editor: E-mail to letters@pe.com .
