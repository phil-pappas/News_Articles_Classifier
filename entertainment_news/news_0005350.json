We want to hear it. Human Error \nThe EA that exists now is a built on the mistakes of an older, more robotic company, mistakes reviled by a furious fanbase desperate to be heard. The anger led to EA earning the Worst Company in America community vote two years in a row. It was the preposterous result of meaningful concerns, and while EA disagreed, it knew it had to take action to improve. \n“The Worst Company in America thing got blown way out of proportion, allowing people to point at this company,” EA COO Peter Moore told IGN. “It was very difficult from the employees, very, very difficult for people here.” \nPatrick Soderlund, Executive Vice President of EA Studios noted that it was “ridiculous” for EA to win the Worst Company in America nomination. It’s a fair assessment, but it struck a nerve internally. \"Winning\" the shameful award meant something to Electronic Arts. \nSoderlund told IGN, “Even though we clearly weren't the worst company in America, it said something. It meant that we couldn't be arrogant about it. We had to listen. People were telling us something.” \nPlayers had significant problems with the way EA composed itself but had no meaningful way of expressing it. The embarrassing award represented players’ problems more than anything else. So EA endeavored to fix what needed fixing. The goal became, “we have to change the perception of the company, we need to understand what's causing this.” \nThings had to change. \nAndrew Wilson became EA’s CEO in September, 2013. He worked on FIFA games, climbed his way up the ranks, and had a huge responsibility. Wilson not only had to run this company, he had to repair it. \n“I made FIFA for a long time, was part of the team, and I think it's really easy to forget we're a bunch of humans that are players that live to play like our player base does, and we just want to make great games,” Wilson told IGN. “I wanted to really expose that. I wanted people to see the human side of Electronic Arts.” \nSuddenly you have faces and names accountable for successes and failures rather than a company’s name. But to a certain degree, that’s easier. People can have conversations, explain the process, answer questions, celebrate, apologize. Companies are much easier to vent anger toward than someone whose hand you can shake. \nIn the past two years, EA has become a large group of forward-facing people. There are recognizable names like Amy Hennig and Jade Raymond in its stable now, both of whom received large, loud-and-proud announcements about their employment at EA. \nThe other main issue EA wanted to address was listening to its audience and implementing important feedback. Soderlund thinks EA has changed “things that we realized were annoying people…. So I think Andrew kind of latched onto that and realized that the whole idea of putting the player in the center is essential when you're making entertainment.” \nIn the end, EA wanted to make games “for the people as opposed to consumers,” Soderlund explained. “You can't behave and act like you don't care about them. Which sometimes, we've done in the past, to be honest,\" he said. \n“You sometimes see these companies, particularly as fast as our industry is growing, changing player wants and needs, VR, AR, whatever,” said Peter Moore. “We’re an old company. We’ve got to continue to be nimble. We’ve got to continue to listen, that is for sure, that’s something we’ve done incredibly well. I think we always listened, but now it’s a heightened view of the ‘player-first’ mantra, which we live to. It’s not just a mantra, motto, slogan. Every meeting I’m in, someone leans forward and says ‘Is that players first?’ It’s something anybody at any level can throw out there, and it makes everyone sit back and pause.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T00:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:53:55.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
