Think before you do and before you speak, will your action result in a proud or unhappy memory?\nAt the same time we are also trying to make life easier by inventing better and faster ways to do things.\nIf you think back in your life, how many times have you needed someone to complete a certain job for you and how difficult was it to get hold of someone to complete this task for you? You went through you regional and national newspaper adds, you pulled your hair out because you through away all the ‘junk’ mail where there were adds in which you could now probably use. You search the internet, you ask friends and family and anybody you can think off. You post on Facebook and you tweet hoping someone will respond. Y\nou do get some numbers or E-Mail addresses and you make contact, or in some cases, you try to make contact because nobody responds and those who do make promises and nothing happen. How much time (and money) has been spent searching alone? How high did your stress level go and how frustrated were you?\nI have seen a lot of people go through this frustration and every time I cannot help but think, how is that possible? I am sure there are a lot of people out there willing and able to provide these services so how are it possible that you cannot find any? How is it that those you do find cannot help you now because they are just too busy with another job? And most of all, how many times did you have to repeat your request?\nIf you think about it, service providers know there is a need because they place ads in all the available media at a high cost to them and there are a lot of options available to them for this (online and paper based – free and at a premium). I am also sure there are other possible providers out there that just cannot afford to place ads and they rely on word of mouth and other free options. I am certain that clients do not find all these ads when they are looking for a provider.\nI have decided the solution to this is there should be a website where both the supplier and client can register and so I went forth and created one. My idea is very simple, I create a database with suppliers, the area they work in and the specialities (tasks/jobs) they can provide. When a client then register a request, the system can link them to one another based an area and speciality.\nThis means the client put down his/her need once and all the registered providers will be notified and will then come back to the client if they are available and willing. I have always asked myself, why, if I have a need, can I not ask suppliers to Tender For Me? Why is it only government and big business that can ask for tenders?\nWill this not result in a lot less stress and frustration? Will it not result in a more competitive market out there (better competition)? Will it not create more opportunities (real equal opportunities) for all?\nOn top of this great idea of mine (and I believe it is) I am old-fashioned, I believe in honesty and integrity. I cannot get myself to ask anyone to pay something if I do not know I am giving something in return, the person need to get value for payment. The system therefore allows both client and supplier to register for free with limited personal information (only the area and E-Mail address) on a secure site. The supplier also registers for all the specialities and areas separately in which he/she can provide a service. This is important as the system need the information be able to link supplier with client.\nWhen a client register a request and the system find registered suppliers falling in the client request criteria, the system will notify the supplier/s via E-Mail. The supplier will then have the option to tender (Quote: ) for the request or not. If the client budget exceeds R1000.00 the supplier will pay a fee of around 1% of the client budget for the right to tender. Requests with a client budget below R1000.00 will be free to tender for as well.\nThe client is still in charge so the client will go through all the tenders received and will then mark the tender/s he/she prefer to proceed with. Only then will the system provide both the client and supplier/s of the other sides E-Mail contact information to finalise discussions and arrangements.\nAt this stage the system is not involved anymore. The client can, after the task was completed, come back and rate the supplier and this rating will be available on the system for other clients to see and they will use that as information when they make their choices. Will this not ensure that suppliers provide the best service they can?\nIf a supplier do decide to tender for a request but the tender is not accepted by the client (marked as short-listed) the system will provide the supplier/s with the layout of the short-listed tenders to allow the supplier to adjust his/her tender procedure/layout in future (remember I still need to provide the supplier with value).\nI do accept, for this to work everybody need to register.\nRemember, together, we can change the world to something we can be proud of tomorrow", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:52:03.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
