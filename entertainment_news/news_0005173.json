Try for a banquette seat along the wall underneath the animal silhouettes, unless you really, really like those metal Tolix chair knockoffs that are everywhere lately. (They look swell, but they're not comfortable.) A runner will bring your food to you when it's ready. \nPRICE: BuffBurger with cheese, $9.70; chocolate shake, $5; sea salt fries, $1.95, for a total of $18.32 including tax. \nARCHITECTURE: Salad stuff on top. On a shiny-topped, griddle-toasted bun goes a half-inch beef patty, a thin layer of shredded sharp cheddar cheese, slices of raw red onion, a fleet of house-made bread-and-butter-style pickle slices, a slice of tomato and several curly lettuce leaves. Last comes a swoosh of house-made mayo, and then a swaddling of pale brown wax paper to hold it all in one neat, photogenic package. Except for the unbleached tint of the paper, which also lined the serving tray, the look was very much in the service style of Danny Meyer's famous Shake Shacks. \nWhen I posted a picture of my burger to Instagram, in fact, a commenter shot back that it must have come from \"The House of Ridiculously Perfect Proportions.\" Indeed. The ratio of meat to fixings to top bun to bottom bun was pretty near 1:1:1:1, making a stack of real elegance. If this is not the prettiest burger in Houston — and it very well may be — it's definitely one of the finalists. \nQUALITY: The meat quality is the thing here: it's naturally raised Angus from the highly regarded 44 Farms in Cameron, to the northeast of College Station, and its beefy flavor positively blooms at first bite. It's the kind of juicy ground beef that doesn't need a pile of condiments to shine, and while the counter guy didn't ask me how I wanted it cooked, the patty came out flushed with pale rose at its heart, a shade under medium, absolutely right. The sear from the griddle was decent but not pronounced. \nIt was at the sandwich level that things started to trend downward. The tomato slice was pale and woeful. The leaf lettuce looked pretty, but it tore instead of crunching. (Sometimes iceberg works better than the fancier stuff.) The layer of shredded cheese was too thin to register much flavor or texture. The house-made mayonnaise quickly dissolved to invisibility, and it didn't seem to add much in the way of flavor. The sweet bread and butter pickles would have worked better against a sharp pop of mustard; but without that classic Texas flavor profile, they tilted the burger toward the sweet. The flavors and textures just didn't click together, leaving that splendid beef patty to do all the work. \nWell, along with the beautifully butter-griddled Slow Dough bun, which had an eggy tint, a glossy egg-washed topside and stood up to its job nicely. \nOOZE RATING: Good. Plenty of meat juices, if no overt drippage. \nGRADE: B overall; but there's an A burger inside trying hard to get out. \nBONUS POINTS: The shoestring fries are as crisp and delicate as they can be, with sundry bits of skin attached, and you get a lot of them. And there are interesting menu options for those who don't want to go the basic burger route, including a \"street corn fritter\" burger for vegetarians, a Thai-inspired glass noodle salad, or a wedge salad with bacon and Point Reyes blue cheese. \nMINUS POINTS: The sea salt treatment on the fries was a little too enthusiastic when I tried them; I ended up drinking lots of water later on. And while my chocolate shake struck just the right balance between solid and liquid (a rare feat), its chocolate flavor was too gentle for its own good — the merest suggestion of chocolate, really. Next time I'd go for the vanilla. \nLOCAL COLOR: The fresh, crisp setting seems made for the prosperous Memorial-area burghers who flock here, and who leave their stamp. (Note the Memorial high Markettes drill team poster in the front window.) The sound track is very much what radio programmers used to call \"Easy Listening,\" golden oldies division, along the lines of \"Spirit in the Sky\" and \"Brown-Eyed Girl.\" I was delighted to find BuffBurger sandwiched between two businesses that sum up Americans' mixed feelings about our great national burger vice: an On Call Emergency Care Center to the left; Gluten Free Nation to the right And yes, Gluten Free Nation supplies gluten-free buns to BuffBurger. \n(BuffBurger, 1014 Wirt Rd. @ I-10, 281-501-9773.
