During the trial of Tan, accused of murdering his father, the jury visited the Tan home in Pittsford where the February killing occurred. County Court Judge James Piampiano, who oversaw the trial, denied media requests to accompany the jury into the house.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nComplete coverage: Charles Tan murder trial\nThe complaint from the Democrat and Chronicle and WHAM-TV (Channel 13) to the state Commission on Judicial Conduct alleges that Piampiano ignored longstanding laws about media access when he denied the media requests to visit the home with the jury. Piampiano did allow the media to be 300 feet from the home.\nAlso, the complaint states, Piampiano, when denying the request, did not allow the media time to contact an attorney to make an argument for access.\nThe complaint notes that both WHAM-TV and the Democrat and Chronicle \"reached out to Judge Piampiano before the jurors traveled to the Tan household\" to discuss media accommodations. Neither received a formal response.\nAlso, the complaint notes, a representative of the Office of Court Administration, the state agency that oversees the court, told WHAM-TV that the crime scene \"should be viewed as a 'court exhibit''' and access granted. The OCA official noted that Piampiano could designate a \"pool reporter,\" a single reporter who would go into the home and report observations to the rest of the media. WHAM-TV proposed this alternative in emails to Piampiano the morning of the jury visit to the home.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nTan won't testify; closing arguments Tuesday\nPiampiano said Friday that he could not comment on issues surrounding the case, which ended in a mistrial Oct. 8 after a jury did not reach a verdict over eight days of deliberations.\nVIDEOS: THE CHARLES TAN MURDER CASE Charlie Tan walks out of court after mistrial | 02:43 Attorneys and jurors in the Charles Tan murder case comment on the mistrial.

In their complaint, the media organizations note that they did not seek serious punishment for what they perceived as Piampiano's legally wrong decision to block the media from the Tan home.\n“We think Judge Piampiano erred in not fully hearing the concerns of the media covering the Tan trial when they were raised,\" said Democrat and Chronicle news director Dick Moss. \"We are not interested in the judge’s punishment as much as we are in reminding other judges of the proper procedures going forward.”\nMatt Malyn, the WHAM-TV news director, said, \"13WHAM News along with our media colleagues in Rochester adamantly believe in the public’s right to total transparency in the judicial process. This did not happen in the Charlie Tan case and can’t be allowed to continue in the future.\n\"When the public is deprived of that transparency it’s impossible to have total trust in the process,\" he said.\nJoining in the complaint with WHAM-TV and the Democrat and Chronicle were WROC (Channel 8), WHEC (Channel 10), and Time Warner Cable News.\nGCRAIG@Gannett.com", "external_links":
