Faisal said that he aspires to be a perfect artiste, and would like to set his foot into Bollywood someday. “It’s not about being known as a dancer or an actor, I want to be a perfect artiste. I want to work in Bollywood and for that I’m putting in more hard work as you need various other qualities to become an actor,” Faisal told IANS over phone, after winning the show, from Mumbai. The actor, who earlier clinched the trophy of “Dance India Dance Li’l Masters 2” in 2013, emerged as the youngest and the first child artiste to win the celebrity dancing reality show on Saturday. He walked away with the trophy, Rs.30 lakhs and a car. The teenager has jotted down names of actors he would like to work, with Nawazuddin taking top spot. “I want to work with Nawazuddin. I love his films as he inspires me a lot. And then Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan. I would like to dance with Tiger Shroff, Hrithik Roshan and Sunny Deol,” he quipped. But he is not restricting himself to any mediums. “I have not thought what I will do. I don’t want to ever take a break from my professional life. So, I want to work… be it TV shows, reality TV or a film,” Faisal said. Faisal’s story seems to take a leaf out of a film like “Slumdog Millionaire”. Son of an auto-rickshaw driver, Faisal fought hardships to emerge as a winner. He even dominated the small screen space as a young Maharana Pratap in a period drama. He is glad that with the Colors show he could resume dancing . “One of the best thing about being a part of the show is that I have started dancing again after acting,” said Faisal, who did “Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa Reloaded” after completing tenth standard and is not thinking of giving up on studies. When asked about what he would do with the prize money, Faisal was quick to respond: “I will give the entire sum to my parents and they will take a decision.” Faisal asserts that with the win he has etched a name for himself in history. “Now, whenever people will look back they will say that Faisal and Vaishali (his dance partner) were the first child actors to win the show . Our names will be remembered for a lifetime,” he said. Many actors express their wish to lead a life away from constant scrutiny, but Faisal says he like his popularity and wants it to increase with time. “My fame is not accompanied by any pressure. I want the whole world to know my name. I also try my level best to try to make all my fans happy by providing them with autographs and getting clicked with them,” he said.
