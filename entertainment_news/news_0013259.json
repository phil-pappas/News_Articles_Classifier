Before that can happen, artist Nedko Solakov says the Frankfurt-based institution must fulfill all its goals and all of its staff must be \"completely satisfied\" - a condition he has inscribed on a plaque on the side of the dark oval hulk.\n\"This will of course never happen because a serious institution is never satisfied,\" he told Reuters. \"I just let the people imagine what the sculpture would look like.\"\nThe work, entitled \"A Site-Specific Piece on Stand-by\", will stand in a cavernous hall, 54 meters (177 feet) high, and will be formally unveiled by ECB President Mario Draghi this week.\nSolakov said he wanted to express irony and humor, directed in part at the severe restrictions imposed on him.\n\"I couldn’t use anything flammable, it couldn’t be too heavy, it couldn’t be too high because it would cross the laser security beams,\" he said.\nHandwritten doodles and jokes adorn the work itself and -- confusingly for cleaning staff -- the rest of the hall, including the elevator sign. Some of them are grammatical corrections of the lengthy inscription.\nBut Solakov said he is not making fun of the institution, which he said he considered one of Europe's most important.\nThe ECB liked the joke: it chose Solakov's work as one of three art installations for which it paid a combined 1.25 million euros ($1.41 million).\n(Editing by Michael Roddy and Mark Trevelyan )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T12:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T11:35:15.091+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
