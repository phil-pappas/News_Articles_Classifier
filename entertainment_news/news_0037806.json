Seanna Cronin | 6th Oct 2015 7:00 AM Seanna Cronin APN Entertainment Editor A US ex-pat, Seanna has been writing about the Australian entertainment industries for the past six years and is also a documentary producer, photographer and scuba diver. The Block contestants Kingi and Caro. Channel 9 Cars For Sale \nTHE Block's expert judges could soon face competition from two of the show's contestants. \nTownsville couple Kingi and Caro received the highest praise possible on the show last night from interior designer and Selling Houses Austrlaia star Shaynna Blaze for their second guest bedroom and bathroom. \n\"I don't say this often but to me this couple has so much talent I hope they do this as a career,\" Blaze said. \n\"They're upping the ante when they need to but they're not getting lost in the style.\" \nThe comments nearly brought Caro to tears after four weeks of hard work on the show's work site and a crash course in styling. \n\"I felt like crying,\" Caro told APN. \n\"That's the ultimate comment you can ever get (on the show), especially from Shaynna. It was one of my favourite moments on the whole Block.\" \nThe former cheerleader, who works as a business development manager, is seriously considering a future in renovation and interior design thanks to her time on the show. \nThe 31-year-old applied for the 11 th season of The Block because of the rendering skills of her trade husband, who hails from Slade Point in Mackay. \n\"I look at things so much differently now,\" she said. \n\"I've definitely got the bug; you get addicted to it. We'll be trying to do something after the show that's for sure.\" \nLast night's win ended three weeks of second-place finishes for the couple, who beat fellow Queenslanders Suzi and Vonni by just half a point. \nBlaze and fellow judges Darren Palmer and Neale Whitaker found little to fault in their near-perfect room featuring a dark grey rendered wall, custom wood bed head and graphic artwork. \nThe win tops off a celebratory long weekend for the parents, who flew to Sydney for the NRL grand final. \n\"It's been a good few days for North Queensland,\" Caro laughed. \n\"People just come up and high-five us and want to have a chat. We like coming home to Townsville because the people are like that.\" blocktagon", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T09:01:00.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
