Alas, past studio albums failed to capture the knowing warmth of his smoky baritone.\n\"My Stupid Heart\" is different, and Mullins sounds terrific in a wide range of styles, summoning gospel fervor on \"Ferguson,\" leading a singalong on \"Sunshine,\" and settling into a sultry sway on \"Go and Fall.\"\nThe Georgia-based singer-songwriter follows his jazz muse down to low F on \"Pre-Apocalyptic Blues,\" a hilarious mix of survivalist paranoia and Dixieland feel-good that rings too true. Mostly the thrice-divorced Mullins contemplates love sweet and soured, wearing his heart on his album sleeve.\nAn excellent supporting cast includes Chuck Cannon , who helped compose six of the 10 songs, and stellar guitarist Tom Bukovac . Credit producer Lari White, who doubles as Cannon's wife, for getting Mullins at his best on the record.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-23T21:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:23:46.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
