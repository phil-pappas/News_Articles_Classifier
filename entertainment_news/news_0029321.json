Fox and Christopher Lloyd – in character as Marty McFly and Doc Brown – \"time-traveled\" in their DeLorean to \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" for an epic reunion.\nIn the bit, which interrupted the opening monologue, Kimmel told Marty and Doc all about the wonders of 2015, including selfies and cronuts. But the iconic characters were less than impressed when they learned there were no flying cars or hoverboards, and that peace hadn't been achieved in the Middle East.\n>> RELATED: WATCH: Nike sends Michael J. Fox his very own pair of self-lacing shoes\n>> PHOTOS: The stars from 'Back to the Future' - then and now\n>> Read more trending stories\n\"If you don't mind me asking, what the hell have you guys been doing for 30 years?\" Marty asked.\nThe only invention that seemed to pique the pair's interest? The smartphone.\n\"This must allow astrophysicists to triangulate complex equations in real time,\" Doc said in amazement.\nKimmel replied, \"Mainly, we use it to send little smiley faces to each other.\"\nAnother question was on Marty's mind: What happened to Biff, the villain \"who became a rich, egomaniacal casino owner and ruined the world\" in \"Back to the Future II\"?\n\"That guy's running for president right now,\" Kimmel replied in an obvious swipe at Donald Trump, who canceled his appearance on the show Tuesday.\nAt the end of the skit, Doc decided to return to 1985 to see where we went wrong and set things right. \"I believe we may have inadvertently traveled into an alternate 2015 where human evolution has been stopped by superfluous technology and Biff reigns supreme,\" Doc said.\nThe bit even included a guest appearance by Huey Lewis, whose songs \"The Power of Love\" and \"Back in Time\" rocked the \"Back to the Future\" soundtrack. He also appeared briefly in the first film as a judge of a band audition.\n>> Click here to watch the video", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0VGRlEJewA"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:29:39.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
