(Mark Bourdillon/BBC/Love Productions) \nThe peak, at 8.55pm was watched by 14.5 million, beating last year’s figure of 13.3 million. \nAs if that wasn’t impressive enough, The Great British Bake Off is the most watched non-sport programme on a Wednesday night since Christmas Day 2002. (Mark Bourdillon/BBC/Love Productions) \nAfter 10 weeks and 30 challenges, including Black Forest Gateaux, Spanische Windtorte, Flaounas and a wobbly Charlotte Russe, the 30-year-old stay-at-home mother from Leeds beat fellow finalists Tamal Ray and Ian Cumming to take the crown. \nNadiya went into the final as the bookmakers’ favourite to win. She delighted fans with her varied facial expressions that switched between delight, despair, shock, terror and joy as she baked her way to victory. \nThe Luton-born baker admitted to a lack of confidence before she went on the show. It was her husband and sister-in-law who persuaded her to apply. (Mark Bourdillon/BBC/Love Productions) \nShe wowed the judges with her iced buns, millefeuille and patriotic Union Jack-themed wedding cake wrapped in a sari. \nNadiya said: “I went into the tent as the smallest baker at 4′ 11″ but I walked out feeling a giant – almost as tall as my fellow baker six footer Mat Riley.” (Mark Bourdillon/BBC/Love Productions) \nCharlotte Moore, the controller of BBC One, said: “Event television at its best! The dramatic and emotional final of The Great British Bake Off rose to the occasion and brought the nation together on BBC One to become the most watched TV show of the year with 13.4 million viewers, and a peak audience of 14.5 million, smashing last year’s final. Congratulations Nadiya and the Bake Off team!” Share article \nThe Great British Bake Off will return to BBC One in 2016.
