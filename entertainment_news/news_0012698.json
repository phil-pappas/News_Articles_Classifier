Macy Gray is second tier, but she added an essential song to the r&b canon. (See “I Try.”) Gomez and Lovato have yet to innovate or drop a perfect song. Gomez and Lovato are redundancies.\nBut they continue to battle their superfluity. Last week, Gomez released the bluntly titled “Revival.” Today Lovato unveils the, well, bluntly titled “Confident.” Both records feature fun pop jamz and trendy (if not trend­setting) tracks. Neither album defines its singer’s sound or personality.\nOf the two, Gomez’s “Revival” comes closer. For her reinvention, she assembled a team of buzzy beat makers and hot hook smiths — Rock Mafia, Stargate, Dreamlab — yet somehow the LP shows restraint. Gomez finds an aesthetic between an ex-Disney star who dated Justin Bieber and the understated, dark anti-pop of Lorde, Lana Del Rey and Frank Ocean.\nThe album doesn’t break into a huge club thumper or obvious Top 40 cut until track 10 (of 11) with “Body Heat.” Instead, Gomez cooks at a simmer as she coos over snaps and a cool keyboard line on “Same Old Love” and mines chill European discotheque for “Me & the Rhythm.” She can fall back into expected ma­terial (the nice, plain piano ballad “Camouflage”), but as a whole, her LP takes risks that offer new, rewarding sounds.\nLovato’s “Confident” breaks the other way. (Did the two make a pact to release albums no one would confuse?) With a wild, thundering voice, she charges into the album with a title track that pulls in bits from Christina Aguilera, Kanye West and Miley Cyrus. Then she takes those riffs and adds more boom (and Katy) for song No. 2, “Cool for the Summer.” Then she ratchets up the energy again (unfortunately, with the same sounds) on No. 3, “Old Ways.”\nLovato attacks and attacks and attacks. Even the (relatively) slower songs feature pounding beats, blaring synthesizer crescendos and vocals that scream “I can compete with Ariana Grande, really I can!”\nPulled together by super-producer Max Martin and his Swedish dance mafia (Laleh Pourkarim, Ilya Salmanzadeh, Alexander Kronlund, etc.), “Confident” tries to compensate for its lack of identity with relentless radio bait — every track recalls something already on the airwaves. Even the guest slot is tired with Iggy Azalea bumbling through “Kingdom Come.”\n“Confident” may outsell “Revival,” but Gomez will have the bigger tour. She is taking baby steps toward a personality, the best strategy for finding a devoted fan base, while Lovato plays it safe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:56:53.563+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
