The Rockwall, Texas -based nonprofit will be presented with a gift at an event following the April 30 art prize gala, at which the winner of the competition will be announced.\nIn the previous two years, Hunting – a leading international oil services company – has donated $285,000 to Patriot PAWS, providing funds to train 10 service dogs. This specialized education program teaches the dogs to perform a wide range of functions, including pulling wheelchairs and opening and closing doors. It costs roughly $34,000 per service dog.\n\"It has been a very special experience to support this organization and its mission,\" said Dennis Proctor , chief executive of Hunting. \"Over the past two years, we have watched with great joy as the dogs have been trained to do what we believe is an honorable, inspiring undertaking – improving the lives and well-being of those who have sacrificed for their country and others in need. We're proud to have this opportunity to continue our support.\"\nThe annual Hunting Art Prize, which is celebrating its 36th anniversary, is open to Texas artists who are 18 or older. Its $50,000 award is the largest single prize in the category of painting and drawing available in North America .\nAs part of the competition, Hunting selects one Texas -based nonprofit each year to receive a donation on behalf of the prize. The gift includes a direct donation as well as a contribution from Hunting that matches the dollars generated from finalists who sell their art at the art prize gala.\nSince 2006, when the competition moved to Houston after a quarter-century in the United Kingdom , Hunting has contributed more than $1.2 million to nonprofits in the state.\nAbout Patriot PAWS\nPatriot PAWS Service Dogs was founded in 2006 as a nonprofit entity providing service dogs at no cost to disabled American veterans and others with mobile disabilities in an effort to inspire and restore physical and emotional independence. Depending on the needs of each individual, service dogs complete a customized training program and learn to perform a variety of functions, including supporting patients with post-traumatic stress disorder.
