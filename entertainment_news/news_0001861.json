The episode picks up where Episode 1 ended, with Rick (Andrew Lincoln) & Co. running back toward Alexandria because of the sound of the horn. [...] most of the Alexandrians in the group are terrified -- especially after the whiny Barnes gets eaten -- but Rick has a plan. Unfortunately, Heath overhears Rick's orders and spends much of the episode with his eye on Michonne, who he believes will cut bait and run at any minute. First Annie twists her ankle. [...] during a small skirmish with walkers, Sturgess freaks out and accidentally shoots Scott in the leg before running away like a coward. While they wait for the duo to return, Annie and Scott urge Heath and Michonne to leave them behind for the good of the group. Glenn insists to Nicholas that he is no longer that cowardly person, and Nicholas, who seems to struggle with his courage multiple times throughout the episode, puts his former friend out of his misery. Realizing they can't wait any longer, Michonne leads her group out of their hiding spot and try to evade the herd. While she laments not being able to let David get home to tell his wife goodbye, Heath, finally realizing the validity of Rick's words, urges the group to move on. Rick dispatches of them, but the gunfire may have done some damage to the RV, because just as the herd closes in, Rick can't get the vehicle to start. (In fact, you could argue his belief in Nicholas after all the things he's done wrong, was his fatal mistake.) And while I understand Rick's increasingly bleak worldview, I enjoy seeing the light that someone like Glenn could sometimes add.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T05:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T05:43:58.955+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
