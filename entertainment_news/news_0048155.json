But then, when doesn't Miley Cyrus show a lot of Miley Cyrus?\nMadam Secretary/The Good Wife\nCBS, Sunday, 8 ET/PT\nGreat guests power the returns of CBS's Sunday duo. On Madam Secretary, you get Morgan Freeman this week, and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright next week. On Good Wife, you get an amusing turn by Jane Curtin as the show's latest judge, and a terrific debut by a recurring addition: Margo Martindale as a savvy strategist who clashes with Eli (Alan Cumming). As always, the entire cast shines, but every time Martindale and Cumming share a scene, it's as if this still-excellent series is giving a new gift to anyone who loves fine, fun acting. As for anyone setting a DVR: Keep those fall football overruns in mind.\n'Homeland' returns for Season 5 with Luna and Lotta Pfitzer as Franny and Claire Danes as Carrie Mathison. (Photo: Stephan Rabold, Showtime)\nHomeland/The Affair\nShowtime, Sunday, 9 ET/PT\nThese two Showtime series return as well. Skipping two years ahead from last season's finale, Homeland finds Carrie in exile in Berlin, working as the head of security for a German philanthropist. That's followed by The Affair , which will now tell its story from four perspectives rather than just two. It's clearly an interesting experiment; what's less clear is whether that leads to an interesting series.\n5 CONNECT 58 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1FKrK3R CriticsCorner", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b2e9b23cd767d8a10443c055f0220c24d0200e88/r=266x400/local/-/media/2015/09/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/635791467493469384-GTY-485996186.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4524902565001_4524817135001-th.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1FKrK3R&mini=true", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4524902546001_4524817135001-vs.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4524902546001_4524817135001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://usat.ly/1FJEtUy", "http://usat.ly/1FKrK3R", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4251d33cea40ac6c571b80946b9a901360e5eb37/c=204-0-3396-2400&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/09/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/635790393277048750-Homeland-501-5867.R.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34f3c12e46e775b6bc7e523d797ba40d553715a7/r=540&c=540x304/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4524902546001_4524817135001-vs.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3d099733e0350b35ae69603f82b2b2512288f1a6/c=0-216-2558-3627&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/09/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/635791467493469384-GTY-485996186.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/635791467493469384-GTY-485996186.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1FKrK3R&text=Weekend%20TV%3A%20%27SNL%2C%27%20%27Good%20Wife%2C%27%20%27Affair%27&via=usatoday"], "published": "2015-10-02T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T18:35:05.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
