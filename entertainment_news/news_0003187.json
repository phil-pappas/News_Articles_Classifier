Someone’s gone and messed up the timeline!\nBecause according to Back to the Future Part II, 2015 is the year when we were supposed to have a whole slew of amazing inventions, gadgets and products. Why haven’t they materialized? Get to the DeLorean! This needs to be fixed!\nIn the 1989 classic sci-fi adventure Back to the Future Part II, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) travels to the eye-popping future of 2015 to help his pal Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) deal with Marty’s wayward children. Marty and his girlfriend Jennifer (Elisabeth Shue) arrive on Oct. 21, 2015 – this Wednesday, to be precise – and are flabbergasted by a world of astounding technology.\nDirector Robert Zemeckis intended a lot of the inventions in Back to the Future Part II to be tongue-in-cheek, but he and screenwriter Bob Gale did get a few things right, including giant flatscreen TVs with hundreds of channels, two-way video calling and smart glasses that allow users to watch videos and make calls. (They also predicted, as a joke, that the Chicago Cubs would win the 2015 World Series. The Cubs are still alive in the playoffs, but we know that’s not going to happen – the Blue Jays are going all the way. Right?)\nSilly or not, here are 10 inventions predicted by Back to the Future Part II that we wish had come to pass. Where are they? Huh? Hello, anybody home? Think, McFly!\nHoverboards\nThere is no gadget in Back to the Future Part II more coveted than the Mattel hoverboard that Marty uses to escape bully Biff Tannen and his gang. Despite a convincing hoax last year by Funny or Die and a wildly impractical prototype by recently unveiled by Lexus, the hoverboards we see in the movie will likely never exist during our lifetime. Heavy.\nMr. Fusion\nWhen Doc Brown returns to 1985 from the future, he’s got a new power source for the DeLorean time machine: a portable nuclear fusion reactor that runs on household garbage. Imagine the energy woes that would be solved with one of these babies! Sort of makes you wonder why there are also automated gas stations in the Hill Valley of 2015.\nRejuvenation centres\nRather than saddle Christopher Lloyd with prosthetics to make Doc Brown look older (other than the mask he wears when he first greets Marty), the filmmakers simply had him say he’d visited a rejuvenation centre that refreshed his skin, replaced some organs and took 30 years off his life. Um, can we have these now, please?\nRetractable hanging garden\nSure, you can grow hydroponic fruit and veggies indoors if you want. But the McFly kitchen in 2015 features a fresh fruit garden that descends from the ceiling on command. Seems wildly impractical, but it would still be cool to have.\nFlawless weather prediction\nDoc Brown is able to predict a rainstorm to the exact minute, thanks to the “weather service.” We’re not sure if this is an agency that can forecast the weather perfectly, or one actually creates it according to a particular schedule. One would be super-convenient, the other sounds kind of sinister.\nPepsi Perfect\nThe wicked-cool bottle with the integrated straw aside, not much is said about what makes the 2015 version of Pepsi so special. But since Pepsi is releasing limited edition Back to the Future-inspired bottles (for a whopping $20.15), we'll soon find out. Hopefully it has, like, all kinds of vitamins and minerals and cellular regeneration enzymes.\nSelf-lacing shoes\nAlthough Nike has already produced a replica of their famous Back to the Future shoes with regular low-tech laces, the company said a version with self-tying powered laces, like those seen in the movie, will debut this year. So far there’s been no sign of them – maybe a surprise release on Oct. 21 is in the works?\nDog-walking drones\nDogs are awesome, but walking them can be a chore. Glimpsed in the Hill Valley of 2015 is a flying robot guiding a pooch on a leash. Perfect for those chilly fall evenings when you just don’t want to leave your 500-channel flatscreen to take Rover around the block.\nBlack & Decker Food Hydrator\nAnother marvel of the McFly kitchen is a gizmo that somehow rehydrates, cooks and expands a miniature pizza into a meal-sized pie. Think of how much cupboard and fridge space this would save! Think how much weight we’d gain!\nFlying cars\nWe’re still wrapping our heads around the notion of self-driving automobiles, and while there are some very cool designs in the works for cars that can transform into tiny airplanes, flying cars as a common form of transportation just ain’t gonna happen any time soon. But if it does, we’ll be buying an old DeLorean to convert. Because where we’re going, we won’t need roads.\nCineplex Entertainment’s Front Row Centre Events is bringing Back to the Future I and II to theatres across the country on October 21, followed by the full trilogy on October 25.\nTHREE THINGS WE'RE GLAD NEVER HAPPENED\nFor all the cool gadgetry found in Back to the Future Part II’s version of 2015, there are some things seen in the 1989 film that we’re really glad didn’t come to pass.\nChiropractic hoverbelts\nAnti-gravity seems to be common in Back to the Future’s 2015, but one of the dumbest uses of this amazing technology is a hovering belt that holds George McFly upside down to cure his bad back. (Why didn’t he just go to a rejuvenation centre?) Of course, it was more a device used to conceal the fact that Crispin Glover was no longer playing the character, due to a contract dispute he had with the filmmakers.\nFashion\nFrom hats that looks like metallic cereal bowls to double neckties (because one tie isn’t uncomfortable enough), Back to the Future’s take on 2015 fashion was mercifully way off-base. A self-drying jacket could come in handy, though.\nJaws 19\nA recently released mock trailer for Jaws 19 made Jaws 5 through Jaws 18 sound pretty awesome, but in reality the Jaws franchise stalled out in 1987. Marty’s encounter with a holographic shark in Back to the Future Part II made holo-movies look cool, but not enough that we’d want to see another Jaws. Sharknado 19, on the other hand...\nTwitter: @stevetilley\nsteve.tilley@sunmedia.ca\nSponsored Links See All Sponsored Links\n'Back to the Future II' predictions: 10 things we wish had come true\nBy Steve Tilley , Postmedia Network First posted: Friday, October 16, 2015 09:00 AM EDT\nGreat Scott!
