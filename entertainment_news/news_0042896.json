She made fizzing cans of pop. She had no confidence and she slowly bloomed and she delivered and she is a beautiful, beautiful woman and made some great bakes. Very well deserved.” Great British Bake Off winner Nadiya (Love Productions) \nThe Bake Off presenter joined Alan for the Chatty Man Stand Up To Cancer special, where they looked back at the baking final. \nThe 46-year-old has just brought out an autobiography, Spectacles. Joking about Bake Off judge Mary Berry, she said: “I had my book launch yesterday and Mary was drinking like a 19th-century pirate with full winking; hollow legs until the end. Sue Perkins on Alan Carr: Chatty Man (Channel 4) \n“She is magnificent. It’s such a swift action. She can knock it back. The rest of us fell by the wayside and she was still dry eyed, bushy tailed.” \nOn Mary being named FHM’s 74th sexiest woman in the world, she said: “Listen, you don’t get to see Mary’s booty because we film from the waist up but she rocks it. She can twerk until the cows come home. No, she has got it. I’m annoyed she isn’t higher. The campaign starts now.” Promoted stories Mary Berry (BBC/Shine TV) \nIn an interview with the Radio Times, finalist Tamal Ray has previously revealed he is single – and would be in the market for a boyfriend. \nSue dubbed Tamal “gorgeous”, adding: “He is beautiful. He will not be single for long that boy.” The Great British Bake Off’s Tamal, with Sue Perkins (Love Productions) \nJonathan Ross also joined Alan on the sofa to talk about the return of The Jonathan Ross Show – and to reveal details of his diet. \nThe star has been following a diet found by his wife on the internet. He said: “She looked online and there is a site she loves called Reddit where there’s lots of interesting stuff and loads of noticeboards. \n“A lot of them were talking about this diet called ‘Keto’. It’s a bit like Atkins but more scientific.” \nThe diet involves eating very little carbohydrate. Jonathan advised: “You won’t miss the chips Alan. Once you go away from the chips you don’t go back to the chips. I’m eating loads of food but I lost like a stone and a half.” Jonathan Ross (Channel 4) \nLucky Jonathan has been able to get a sneak preview of parts of the new James Bond film, Spectre, through his involvement in interviewing the stars for a special show. \n“There’s a couple of things that I don’t think anyone has ever done in chase scenes,” he revealed. “There is a thing in Austria – look out for that! I don’t think they’ve ever done that in a movie before. It looks incredible. I think it’s going to be great.” \nMade in Chelsea star Jamie Laing and First Dates host Fred Sirieix popped in for a chat ahead of the Celebrity First Dates special, while This Is England ’90 star Thomas Turgoose returned to honour his bet from the first show to get Alan Carr tattooed on his bottom if £5,000 was raised for Stand Up For Cancer.
