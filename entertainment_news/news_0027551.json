George, who won the Heisman in 1995 and went on to a nine-year career in the NFL, leading the Tennessee Titans to Super Bowl XXXIV, will start work at the Ambassador Theatre beginning Jan. 11. He's appeared in Matthew Lopez's \"The Whipping Man\" at the Nashville Repertory Theatre, Suzan-Lori Parks' \"Topdog/Underdog\" at Amun Ra Theatre, also in Nashville, and played both Othello and Julius Caesar at the Nashville Shakespeare Festival. Set in the 1920s, \"Chicago\" is a scathing satire of how show business and the media make celebrities out of criminals. It has skimpy outfits and killer songs such as \"All That Jazz\" and \"Cell Block Tango.\" By MARK KENNEDY, AP Drama Writer Journal Star By MARK KENNEDY, AP Drama Writer Posted Oct. 26, 2015 at 11:30 AM Updated at 11:31 AM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T18:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:49:18.134+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
