Chris Christie answers a question as he addresses a gathering at the Chabad House at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J. In a book published this week by Nicole \"Snooki\" Polizzi, a cast member on the MTV reality series \"Jersey Shore,\" she recalls an encounter with Christie, saying his expression was “full of hate” after she introduced herself in 2013 when both were on the boardwalk in Seaside Heights. Their tense encounter was caught on video and recounted in “Strong is the New Sexy,” in a passage titled “The Governor of New Jersey Tried to Eat Me.” Christie has disparaged the reality TV show as bad for the state’s image. Snooki has called him a bully. (AP Photo/Mel Evans)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:41:58.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
