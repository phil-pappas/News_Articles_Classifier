Win one for Evan.\" \nAuthorities said Murray, who played for Warren Hills Regional High School in Washington Township, died from massive internal bleeding caused by a lacerated spleen. \nThe funeral for the popular three-sport star and honors student was held Thursday. \nBon Jovi's son, Jesse Bongiovi, made it onto Notre Dame's football team as a walk-on in 2013. \n___ \nOnline: http://bit.ly/1MNHPW1 Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
