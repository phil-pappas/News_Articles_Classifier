It was the first of six straigh lbw wickets for Victoria, the final of which left NSW on 6-172 off 37 overs.\nIn the end NSW’s untested tail was unable to make up the rest of the runs, with Scott Boland bowling Nathan Lyon (1) in the 49th over.\nHaving already secured a spot in the final, the Blues rested captain Steve Smith, but recalled Starc to a bowling attack that also featured Test stars Josh Hazlewood and Lyon.\nOther Stories Awesome All Blacks lay Cardiff ghosts to rest Rugby 0 comments Will Geoffrey ever find love again?

Opinion 0 comments Robert Irwin’s animal instinct Celebrity Starc (4-58) struck in the game’s third over, clean bowling Aaron Finch (2), but he had to wait until the 45th over to get his next wicket.\nPlaying in his first game of the season, opener Rob Quiney scored 79 runs from 75 balls, managing to dull the new-ball attack of Starc and Hazlewood without damaging Victoria’s run rate.\nFor a while it looked like Quiney was going to be the only batsman to make a stand for the Vics, with Cameron White (27), Glenn Maxwell (5), Peter Handscomb (20) and Dan Christian (1) all falling before the 25th over to leave the Bushrangers at 5-122.\nQuiney was the next man to go, stumped off Stephen O’Keefe (1-35), but a quickfire 63 off 65 balls from Matthew Wade ensured the Bushrangers went well past 200.\nThe Victoria keeper ran out of partners in the end, with Starc knocking over the last three wickets to end Victoria’s innings in the 47th over.\nThe left-hander has now taken at least four wickets in each of his last seven domestic one-day games and has taken 23 for the season at an average of 7.47\nRe-live the action in our blog below.\nOriginally published as Bushrangers end New South Wales’ winning run", "external_links": ["http://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/matador-cup-live-scores-coverage-of-new-south-wales-v-victoria-at-north-sydney-oval/story-e6frf3g3-1227573093539?sv=c33323fe680654a3e3386309ed19682c", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/1b8196d378545a40b81428ac5c711d9c", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/99fcba8ae82c8c3a820d363ee6835cce", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c5cae69f6310b1ac75aa7260fd194394", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b0eb27853091a774fcb6de188930e46b", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/8f3fc487c88364970742ba4bbaf99415", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/273f8d21f4a54f0720388382dc1eee50", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-10-18T14:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T10:13:05.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
