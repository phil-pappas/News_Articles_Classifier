She wishes Justin would keep his mouth shut! \n''Justin feels like he's grown up a lot, but Selena is embarrassed by his confessions.'' \nThe 'Where Are You Now' hitmaker, 21, also recently told Complex magazine that he and Selena had a very intense bond and fought like divorcees at times. \nHe said: ''My identity was in her. Her identity was in me. When stuff would happen, I would lose my freakin' mind, and she would lose her mind, and we would fight so hard because we were so invested in each other.'' \nThe singer admitted he has moved on but will always compare his future girlfriends to Selena. \nHe explained: ''Yeah. You get scarred from certain things. Even like--I'm kind of seeing this girl, right? I'm shy about doing or saying certain things, and then I say it and it's not even a problem. And I'll remember when I couldn't.... You're just scarred and you don't do something because in your last relationship they'd freak out, but [the new person is] just like, ''What are you talking about?''
