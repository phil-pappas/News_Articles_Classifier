Miami collaborates with youth empowerment Free2Luv to stand up to bullying during October Bullying Prevention Month.\nMiami, FL, October 08, 2015 --( PR.com )-- Animate! Miami, Florida's largest anime and animation convention held October 23-25, 2015, is joining forces with anti-bullying nonprofit Free2Luv® during Bullying Prevention Month in October to raise awareness and empower the public to stand up against bullying. Free2Luv Youth Advocate, actor and Animate! Miami special guest, Jason Drucker is also speaking up about bullying prevention and the importance of taking a stand.\n\"Geek culture conventions like Animate! Miami and Florida Supercon are, at their core, meant to be places of acceptance for fans that can't express their passions in their normal day-to-day lives. Going back to the first sci-fi convention in 1939, shows like these are meant to be a place to get your geek on, free from judgment and harassment. I'm thrilled to be working with Free2Luv, as their mission aligns closely with the values of our events. I think it’s important to spread the message that it’s ok to be yourself, and that it’s not cool to bully others because they're different,\" said Mike Broder, founder of Animate! Miami and Florida Supercon.\n\"We are really excited about partnering with Florida Supercon and sharing our message of rocking individuality with their audience. We are passionate about reaching youth where they are whether it’s online or at awesome conventions such as Animate! Miami. We want every person to know that they’re perfect just the way they are,\" said Tonya Sandis, Co-Founder and President of youth empowerment nonprofit, Free2Luv.\n9-year-old Jason Drucker, star of Nickelodeon’s Every Witch Way and the film Barely Lethal, is an important voice in the Free2Luv organization. “Bullying is not funny, it’s not a game, it’s not about who wins or loses. In the end, the bully and victim both lose. If I can make a difference in one person’s life, then I know it is all worth it,” says Drucker.\nWith the rise in teen suicides and 1 out of every 3 children experiencing some form of bullying, Free2Luv is on a #MillionSignMission to bring awareness and solidarity to bullying prevention. At Animate! Miami, guests will be invited to join friends across the globe, stand up, take photos with a “Friends Don’t Let Friends Bully” sign and share via social media with #Free2Luv. To learn more about the Million Sign Mission, visit Free2Luv's website.\nFree2Luv will be spreading its message of rockin’ kindness and bullying prevention at Animate! Miami, which draws a large percentage of kids and teens.
