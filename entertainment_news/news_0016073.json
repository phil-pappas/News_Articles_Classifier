Plans to make a follow-up have been halted and the project will likely be developed as a series through Paramount TV instead. \"Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters\" was never a stellar performer, grossing only $55 million in North America on a $50 million budget. The action comedy movie, however, was well-received overseas, raking in more than $150 million for a worldwide total of $205 million. Paramount and MGM announced in March 2013 that a sequel was in the works. Bruno Avellian was brought in as director when Tommy Wirkola said he wouldn't return. He, however, was still on board as scriptwriter. \"The script is really cool and opens up a new world of Voodoo. So that's the world where the sequel goes,\" Wirkola said last year. The plan was to start shooting this year but the wheels never officially moved. According to Deadline , the project is now looking like a cable series which will be produced by Gary Sanchez in partnership with MGM. \"This is early, and they are still figuring it out, but it is a hot topic because the filmmakers all were taken by surprise,\" the site reported. Being a TV series is deemed more profitable for \" Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters 2 \" than a feature film. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Required fields are marked with *", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T10:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:45:25.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
