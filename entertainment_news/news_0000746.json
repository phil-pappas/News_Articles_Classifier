MUSIC\nWHO: Peter Frampton.\nWHAT: Frampton performs an acoustic-only set for the first time ever. His longtime collaborator Gordon Kennedy and son, singer and guitarist Julian Frampton, will join him.\nWHEN: 8 p.m. Wednesday.\nWHERE: Bergen Performing Arts Center, 30 N. Van Brunt St., Englewood;bergenpac.org.\nTICKETS: $35 to $120, ticketmaster.com or 800-745-3000.\nPeter Frampton remembers quite clearly when his rock-and-roll career hit its mind-boggling pinnacle — and it wasn’t exactly the most euphoric feeling. \"One day I was sat down, and my manager said, ‘I have to tell you something. You are No. 1 on the Billboard charts.’ So that was one thing. Then a couple of weeks later, I was sat down and told: ‘You’re the biggest-selling record ever. You beat Carole King’s ‘Tapestry.’ And at that moment, I got scared. Because I had to compete with this now.\"\nHaving to compete with one’s self might not sound so bad, for those of us in the rat race who have to compete with other people. But as pampered and as rich and as famous and as crazy a rock-and-roller as he may have been, Frampton was also level-headed enough to know that nothing this good could last.\n\"The greatest thing about it all was that it surpassed any dream of what the album could do or where my career could go,\" he says of the 1976 iconic album, \"Frampton Comes Alive,\" which sold 10 million copies and held the notable distinction of being the best-selling live rock album in history until 1998. \n\"But first of all, it was a live album. So now, I have to do a studio album, which is a different animal altogether. That’s where I realized that being No. 1 and being ‘the best’ is not necessarily the best place to be.\"\nNot that Frampton, who will give an acoustic concert Wednesday at bergenPAC in Englewood, didn’t know what making a studio record was like. For many who only know him for songs like \"Baby I Love Your Way\" and \"Do You Feel Like I Do?,\" Frampton was one of the hardest-working musicians out there long before he hit it big. Born in 1950 in England, Frampton began his career with the bands Humble Pie and the Herd. Frampton spent his adolescent years performing with bands like the Little Ravens, the Trubeats and George & the Dragons (a group that included fellow up-and-coming musician and still good friend David Bowie).\nBowie and Frampton attended the same technical school growing up together. \"I would see him playing sax and singing in the local places, outdoor events that they would have at school. Fairs and things. Meanwhile I was just getting started in my own band. But I always looked up to him,\" he says of Bowie. \"We would jam together, from time to time, on the stairs at lunch time.\"\nMany years later, Bowie gave him a huge opportunity to record with him on 1987’s \"Never Let Me Down\" record and tour with him as well. \"It was a wonderful gift he gave me because at that point, my career was at its lowest point ever. And he brought me back on stage in huge stadiums and I was Frampton the guitarist once again,\" he says. \"We remain relatively close, all these years later.\"\nFrampton has a way of collaborating well with many of the greats, and wasn’t below taking second billing to some of those artists in the leaner years that followed the unbeatable success of his \"Frampton Comes Alive.\" He was opening act for Stevie Nicks during her \"Rock a Little\" tour in 1986, which Nicks herself has said many times publicly was the tour that made her realize she needed to become sober. \n\"It was great to be on tour with her. I had just put out my first record in four or five years. I did notice that she was a little ‘out there,’ at that point,\" he said. \"But I was a little ‘out there’, myself. I don’t remember a lot, actually,\" he says, with a laugh. \"I was in the same position she was. I know exactly how she felt, at the time. And now, having sobered up 12 years ago myself, I know how great it is to be able to do that. She is a wonderful talent and lovely human being and she has always been a dear friend.\"\nSober, touring with his son Julian, who makes a guest appearance, and performing songs acoustically in small theaters. Can this still be satisfying, when you were once rocking stadiums, selling millions and running wild? \n\"I’ve had the best of both worlds,\" he says. \"It doesn’t matter what size the audience is. It’s always enjoyable, on different levels. I love playing theaters.\"\nIs it more naked, playing the hits acoustically? \"I don’t know. Because I’ve never done it before,\" he says, with a bit of nervous laughter. \"But that’s what I love the most. That’s what drives me. To do something today, that I haven’t done yet.\"\nEmail: petrick@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:32:44.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
