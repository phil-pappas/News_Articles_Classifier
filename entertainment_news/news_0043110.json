The actor was recently seen in a cameo role in Asif Ali-starrer Kohinoor as Bhavana’s pair for the song Dum Dum.\nHe will be back on screen in a full-length role in the upcoming heist film, Jespal Shanmugham’s ATM aka Any Time Money, and says getting to work with Jackie Shroff was an unbelievable experience.\n“Jackie Shroff is someone I grew up watching onscreen as a kid. So when I came to know that I would be working along with him, I was excited. I mean, here was a very experienced and veteran Bollywood actor I used to admire, and I was getting to share screen space with him!”\n“I was very tense initially, but he was very friendly on the sets and immediately put me at ease. It was great just watching him work and he behaved more like a long-lost friend than a Bollywood celebrity. It was a great opportunity,” says Hari.\nReferring to his role in ATM, he says, “The story revolves around a bank heist and Jackie Shroff’s character is the mastermind of the robbery. He picks four small-time thieves for the job and that is how I, Bhagath, Praveen and Vinayakan come together. Subiksha is the female lead and is paired opposite Bhagath. The shoot of the film was initially planned in Alappuzha as the story was set there, but since it was raining heavily there, we changed the location to Palakkad. But you’ll see that it is a story that could very well take place in Palakkad as it could in Alappuzha.”\n entertainment Mollywood Hari Krishnan Also Read 'My Life Partner' was delayed due to the stigma attached to the gay community: M.B.
