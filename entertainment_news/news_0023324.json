(Getty Images) Emily Yahr, The Washington Post The Washington Post \nThree of the entertainment world's most influential voices made headlines last week and they were all talking about one thing: Power. Specifically, power in an industry that typically is much more difficult for women. Here's what each of them had to say. \nRihanna: Power in business \nThe pop star sat down with author/director Miranda July for a rare interview with the New York Times. In a wide-ranging conversation that covered everything from childbirth to music, July asked Rihanna about race and power. \n\"I wanted to ask her about being a young black woman with power in America but it seemed somehow wrong to speak of this; maybe she was postracial now,\" July wrote. \"So I directed my question to a younger Rihanna, and asked if she had suddenly felt aware of race in a different way when she moved to New York.\" Rihanna replied: \n''You know, when I started to experience the difference - or even have my race be highlighted - it was mostly when I would do business deals.'' Business deals. Meaning that everyone's cool with a young black woman singing, dancing, partying and looking hot, but that when it comes time to negotiate, to broker a deal, she is suddenly made aware of her blackness. ''And, you know, that never ends, by the way. It's still a thing. And it's the thing that makes me want to prove people wrong. It almost excites me; I know what they're expecting and I can't wait to show them that I'm here to exceed those expectations.'' Rihanna isn't the provocative woman you may think she is Rihanna gets candid on the November issue of Vanity Fair, sharing tidbits about her then-boyfriend Chris Brown, her career and the not-so-naughty image that people may think she's all about. The Times' Christy Khoshaba has the details.

I got mad at myself. I failed as a negotiator because I gave up early. I didn't want to keep fighting over millions of dollars that, frankly, due to two franchises, I don't need,\" Lawrence wrote. \"But if I'm honest with myself, I would be lying if I didn't say there was an element of wanting to be liked that influenced my decision to close the deal without a real fight. I didn't want to seem 'difficult' or 'spoiled.'\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:53:48.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
