This is growing up in modern Britain - but with monsters!\" \nPatrick adds: \"I'm astounded and thrilled to be entering the ‘Doctor Who’ universe, which is as vast as time and space itself. \n\"There's so much room there for all kinds of amazing stories, and to work with Steven Moffat and Brian Minchin to find a place to tell one of my own has been an absolute joy. \n\"I can't wait for people to meet the heroes of ‘Class’, to meet the all-new villains and aliens, to remember that the horrors of the darkest corners of existence are just about on par with having to pass your A-Levels.\" \nPatrick Ness \nThis isn’t the first time the BBC have masterminded a ‘Doctor Who’ spin-off, and their previous series ‘The Sarah Jane Adventures’ was a huge hit with TV fans. \nThe latest series of ‘Doctor Who’ has got off to a shaky start, however bosses received some good news, when the ratings got a boost thanks to 2 million viewers who watched the show’s premiere via catch-up services. \nThere’s still plenty of drama ahead in the series, and the coming episodes will feature guest appearances from ‘Game Of Thrones’ star Maisie Williams and Ingrid Oliver. \n‘Class’ is coming to BBC3 in 2016. Close Best Celebrity Appearances On 'Doctor Who' of   Anne voiced a robot version of herself, the hillarious Anne Droid, in the episode 'Bad Wolf'. The Anne Droid fronts a dystopian version of 'The Weakest Link', who obliterates contestants with a laser, rather than the 21st century Anne's acidic putdowns. The episode also saw Davina McCall playing a Davinadroid, who hosted a futuristic version of 'Big Brother' (we suppose that would be an Emmadroid now...). Beneath those alarming prosthetics sits Peter Kay, who went all out for his appearance in the episode 'Love & Monsters'. The Northern comedian played The Abzorbaloff, who masqueraded as a human being, in an episode in which The Doctor and his companion featured only briefly. We suppose if you'd splashed out on that costume you'd want it to be seen as much as possible... Kylie played Astrid Peth, companion to David Tennant's Doctor in the 2007 Christmas special, 'Voyage Of The Damned'. She received a mixed reception for the part, which was created especially for her by producer Russell T Davies, with most of the action taking place on a re-imagined futuristic Titanic. Good boots, too. Another British comedian who underwent quite the makeover for his 'Who' role. David played the Gibbis in the episode 'The God Complex', a rodent-like alien who encounters Matt Smith's Doctor when he crash-lands in what appears to be an 80s hotel. And you thought 'The Shining' was weird... Suranne had the honour of playing a new incarnation of a 'Doctor Who' staple in 2011, when she took on the role of a humanoid version of the TARDIS. In 'The Doctor's Wife', Surrane plays Idris, a human who takes on the personality of the TARDIS, with Michael Sheen also making a voice appearance in the episode. James played The Doctor's temporary housemate, Craig Owens, in the episode 'The Lodger', which sees The Doctor stranded on Earth, and forced to fit in with everyday humans. He reprised the role in the following series, during which he's married to Sophie (Daisy Haggard), who Matt Smith's Doctor helped him get together with, and they have a baby son. Olivia's 'Doctor Who' role was a fairly ordinary one... oh, unless you count those terrifying gnashers, that is. Like several guest stars before her, Keeley's appearance in the last series of 'Doctor Who' was only meant to be a one-off stint. However, her appearance as the villainous Ms Delphox was so well-received by Whovians that they can look forward to her reprising the role in the latest series. In a rare moment of self-awareness from Derek Acorah, he appeared in a brief cameo role during the episode 'Army Of Ghosts', joking that he'd no longer be of use once ghosts began to roam the earth. It was a blink-and-you'll-miss-it appearance on a TV screen, but we enjoyed it nontheless. Viewers were so taken with Catherine Tate's portrayal of Donna Noble that she eventually wound up as the Doctor's companion, and went on to become one of the most popular characters of the modern era of 'Doctor Who'. Does he look a bit familiar to you? Long before he was cast as the Twelfth Doctor himself, Peter Capaldi made an appearance during David Tennant's time as Time Lord, playing Caecillius in an episode set in ancient Pompeii.  Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T15:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:57:26.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
