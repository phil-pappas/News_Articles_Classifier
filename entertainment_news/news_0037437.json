Just follow Sasha Mielczarek's  red shirt according to the photographer who staked out the couple at the Star Hotel in Sydney.\nSasha's red T-shirt that gave it all away. Photo: Fitzy & Wippa via Twitter \n\"It was no diabolical plan, no sneaky tip offs,\" Ben McDonald, CEO of photo agency Matrix Media Group, told Fairfax Media about the photograph that appea red on Daily Mail Australia's home page two hours before Sam Frost's  Bachelorette finale and was the subject of a late night court injunction .\nAdvertisement The photos showed Frost and Mielczarek cuddling in a hotel room in Sydney's CBD on Thursday afternoon.\n\"We knew from the Bachelor series that Channel Ten use the Star Hotel for their talent,\" said McDonald. \"It was the same pattern this time. We also know that major celebrities get rooms on the same side of the hotel. Sasha was wearing a red  T-shirt with a distinct blue pocket.\nThe story started circulating on Twitter, ruining The Bachelorette finale for many viewers. Photo: Twitter \n\"It was pretty simple, there was a quite muscular male with a red  T-shirt sitting on a chair within a room. It wasn't the case that they were on the 10th floor, they were on the second floor.\"\nThe comments go against what Bachelorette Sam Frost told KIIS FM on Friday morning.\n\"We worked so hard... someone has tipped someone off and it was just awful,\" she said.\nSam Frost and Sasha Mielczarek in The Bachelorette Australia 2015 finale. \nMcDonald also added that the couple were in plain sight for anyone to see.\n\"The homeless guy on the corner also saw them. One of our competitors was on the corner too but managed to miss it.\n\"It wasn't the case that we were in another building. Once we saw Sasha we just let it all unfold. Eventually Sam came into view and it was clear by their interaction what was going on.\"\nMcDonald was one of two photographers who waited on a street corner for the photo that would spoil the â€‹five week build up to The Bachelorette finale.\n\"At one point a sharp series of commercial photo flashes went off and various make up and publicity staff came into view. It was clear that there was a photo shoot for a media organisation going on.\"\nMcDonald said that he didn't consider the photograph an invasion of privacy. \n\"This was not two people engaging in private activity. They were there for a commercial purposes. They were already being photographed by another commercial group. It would have been different if they were just going into their bedroom alone.\"\nMcDonald also revealed he had been criticised by friends for being part of the spoiler but felt no personal responsibility towards fans.\n\"That's a matter for the publisher, writers and editors how they want to handle it. We don't write the story.\n\"I did cop some flak from some friends on social media for ruining their nights and champagne parties. I have felt the kickback.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T11:19:26.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
