Instead, they channel their enthusiasm for all things orange and blue through a much more elaborate ensemble. \nYou know the fans I'm talking about. It's the guy garbed in a Tiger costume at every game, the woman wearing a dress designed to look like a football and the group of students sporting head-to-toe body paint. Sure, some might call them eccentric, but no one is doubting their allegiance to Auburn football. \nInterested in joining their ranks? Here's a list of nine essentials that will take your gameday spirit to the next level. \nAuburn Superhero Cape \nCould showcasing your love for the Tigers get much easier? All you need is this cape, arm cuffs and eye mask set, and you're ready to take on gameday. Just make sure you've decided which Auburn cheer you want to serve as your theme song. \nAuburn Onesie \nIf you're going for a look that screams clearly states your love for Auburn while also making your gameday experience super comfy, the Auburn onesie is for you. Trust me, if anyone gives you a hard time about the piece of awesome that is an adult onesie, it's just because they're jealous. \nAuburn Skin Suit \nIf making a decision on what to wear the gameday is too difficult, just throw on this Auburn skin suit and call it a day. In seconds, you'll become an anonymous fan with a single message to those that pass you by in the streets and during the game: War Eagle. \nSpirit Wig \nNothing says \"I love Auburn\" quite like sporting a head full of orange and blue hair. Whether you're wearing a T-shirt, jersey or the Auburn Christmas sweater mentioned above, it's the perfect gameday accessory. \nOrange and Blue Body Paint \nBody paint is a classic way to amp up your spirit ranking without breaking the bank. Whether you go for just an orange and blue face only or cover your entire body in tiger stripes, fans around you will know your dedication to Auburn knows no limits. \nAuburn Christmas Sweater \nSure, December is still a few months away, but that doesn't mean you can't combine your love for the Tigers and Christmas. Low temperatures are just around the corner so why not supply some warmth, spirit and general jolliness to gameday? \nTiger Dress \nFor the ladies looking to express their football fandom, this Tigers dress might be the perfect solution. Complete with hoodie and attached paws, it's a statement piece letting everyone know that you think it's great to be an Auburn Tiger. \nAuburn Overalls \nWhen it comes to these overalls, there's really no wrong way to wear 'em. You can pair them with a T-shirt, wear them over a jersey or just don the overalls alone. No matter what, the orange and blue stripes will speak for themselves. \nAuburn Underwear \nBecause no gameday outfit is complete without a pair of lucky undies, these orange and blue knickers are a good choice for those fans that want to keep their seriously spirited side on the down low.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:44:31.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
