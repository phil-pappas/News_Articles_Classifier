Still, it’s a struggle to figure out what Helen Sneed’s perplexing 2013 Off Broadway comedy is trying to say.\nAnnabell (Brett Warner), a high-strung young woman wearing a fur and pearls and flashing a blue sapphire ring, storms into the dressing room at Neiman Marcus in NorthPark Center, desperate to find the right dress to wear to a cousin’s wedding. Her life depends on it, she tells the calm and kindly shopping assistant, Mrs. Craig (Brandi Andrade), with her typical hyperbole.\nAs the poor little rich girl discards one hopelessly ill-fitting or inappropriate $2,000 dress after another, she has flashbacks about the people she blames for her low self-esteem, particularly her racist grandmother (Gene Raye Price) and beautiful, cold mother (Sherry Hopkins) who’s had her on diet pills since she was little.\nIt’s entertaining to hear the many Dallas references from a native Texan playwright, but how to begin with the problems? The show is set in 1986, while Ronald Reagan is president. What evidently makes Annabell special is that she’s a Democratic politician, daring to speak up for the poor and disenfranchised against the wishes of her own family and the overwhelming majority in her red state.\nWe never learn, however, why she took up her liberal positions. Her passion also seems limited to speeches. She doesn’t interact or do hands-on work with the groups for which she advocates. When elections don’t go her way, she runs home, shattered, to shop or go to the country club.\nWarner draws laughs and elicits moments of poignancy as Annabell squirms into dresses, mocking her figure and life. Emily Scott Banks’ direction artfully guides the figures that haunt Annabell in and out through mirrored doors of the dressing room like memories made manifest. Hopkins’ coldness as the manipulative mother is accentuated by Price, who chills the room as the pistol-packing grandmother who detests Communists, a group she believes is lurking around every corner, and everyone that’s not straight white Anglo Saxon Protestant.\nThe stage coils with tense life each time the mother and grandmother interact with young Annabell, played with precocious vulnerability by Sydney Noelle Pitts, a fifth-grade student at the Greenhill School in Addison. Andrade’s helpful Mrs. Craig counters with palpable warmth. Shane Beeson soldiers on in the thankless role of Annabell’s enigmatic psychoanalyst.\nThe story stumbles when it glides over abusive situations that should spur punitive action. It trivalizes mental illness by taking someone from suicidal ideation to a sunny outlook by saying the right words. Ultimately, it’s just plain confusing.\nAnnabell loves to read and a conflict is raised when the bulk of her books, all classic literature choices, meet with her grandmother’s disapproval. But what does Wuthering Heights have to do with the rest of the story? It’s all part of a jumble of thoughts, as twisted as the dresses Annabell discards on the floor.\nPlan your life Continues through Oct. 11 at Theatre Three, 2800 Routh St., Dallas. $25-$50. 214-871-3300. theatre3dallas.org .
