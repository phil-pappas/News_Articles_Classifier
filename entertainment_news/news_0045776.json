I couldn’t go out now and get rip-roaring drunk; I’d take a week to recover and I value my life too much. Plus, I have children.” \nKate is welcoming 40 in a big way. In addition to Steve Jobs hitting theaters October 23, she has two more films coming out over the next six months, The Dressmaker and Triple 9 . \n“I feel like the past two years have been different for me, deliberately so,” she tells The Edit . “I really wanted to mix it up a bit, and feel that I was going full pelt towards 40 having done as much as I could: pushed myself, challenged myself, exhausted myself, had as much fun as possible. The last two years of my life have put a different sort of rocket fuel up my backside.” \nIn The Dressmaker , Winslet stars opposite Liam Hemsworth, and admits she was concerned about playing the 25-year-old's love interest. “I did say to Jocelyn [Moorhouse, the director], ‘Are we going to get away with this?’ And she said, ‘Yeah, yeah, he looks older than he is.’ Anyway, I don’t feel old. I feel excited about being 40.” \nWinslet plays marketing guru Joanna Hoffman in Steve Jobs , which also stars Michael Fassbender, Seth Rogen and Jeff Daniels. \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
