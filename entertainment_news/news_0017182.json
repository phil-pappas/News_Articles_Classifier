The incident occurred in January this year when the couple arrived at the airport and made their way through the swarming paparazzi. According to the lawsuit, Olivier \"abruptly turned towards Ronaldo and brutally and intentionally charged at Ronaldo using an empty child's car seat he held in his hands as a weapon, striking Ronaldo to the ground with the seat and causing Ronaldo humiliation and injury.\" The suit cited media coverage of the incident to support the \"humiliation\" claim. Ronaldo also denied blocking the couple's exit from the airport as he claimed that he had the right to be where he was as an LAX officer. The suit further accused the 49-year-old actress of encouraging her husband to \"attack\" Ronaldo. The suit sought at least $5 million in damages. The LAX officer had previously filed a battery report against Olivier. However, the L.A. city attorney refused to prosecute. On the other hand, Ronaldo, like the paparazzi on the scene, allegedly took pictures of the couple using his phone. The couple hasn't commented on the issue yet. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T09:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:27:20.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
