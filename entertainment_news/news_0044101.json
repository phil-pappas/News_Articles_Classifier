The EU average for the same question is 82%.\nWhen it came to a lesbian, gay or bisexual President or Taoiseach, 81% of Irish people said they would have no problem compared to the EU average of 54%. As for gay marriage, 80% of Irish people it should be available across the entire European Union in comparison to the total average of just 61%.\nAs for their children having a relationship with a black person, the survey found that 78% of Irish people would have no problem with. For Asians and members of the Roma community, the result was slightly less - 79% and 59%, respectively.\nWhen asked if they felt there was widespread discrimination in Ireland based on ethnic grounds, 58% believed there was.\nOverall, the survey found that Ireland is amongst the most tolerant and inclusive of countries in the EU - which is pretty good, in fairness.\nVia IrishTimes.com\nMORE: Watch: Boyfriend hypnotised into slapping himself in the head when he checks out women\nMORE: Watch: John Oliver went after legal LGBT discrimination last night\nMORE: Capture the colour of October and #paintitpink this Breast Cancer Awareness Month!", "external_links": ["http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/irish-among-most-tolerant-in-europe-claims-eu-wide-survey-1.2374814"], "published": "2015-10-02T07:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:16:40.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
