And in acknowledgement of the green theme, participants are being encouraged to wear something green on the day. \nAlong Tutanekai and Haupapa streets cyclists, skaters, scooter users and skateboarders - and people on foot - will enjoy entertainment by Rotorua’s Highland Pipe Band, the Rotorua Racco Taiko drumming circle and quirky ukulele quintet the Thermaleles. In Kuirau Park there will be dance performances by AMJAZZ and Cuban dance troup Dance 2 Inspire. \nRotorua Lakes Council's Inner City Revitalisation Portfolio lead, Councillor Karen Hunt, says the entertainment reinforces that the Green Corridor has been designed as a way for people to experience and enjoy the inner city. \n\"It’s not meant as a quick thoroughfare but as a way to relax and explore what’s on offer in city. Having talented local acts along the way reflects those experiences. We want people to feel engaged and excited by the new corridor and what it represents as part of our inner city revival.\" \nRadio station The Hits will be on board for the entire parade, helping to host the celebration, pumping out music and getting everyone involved in the entertainment, including interactive photos, prize draws, and handing out lollies and balloons. \nTwo Australian-based representatives of the UN’s Global Compact City Programme, deputy director Elizabeth Ryan and programme researcher Brendan Barrett, will be joining Mayor Steve Chadwick at the celebrations. Rotorua is New Zealand’s only United Nations Global Compact City - part of a world-wide programme to progress social equity, justice, environmental sustainability and good governance in the urban environment - and the Green Corridor helps support many of the programme’s guiding principles. \nThursday’s (October 8) Green Corridor celebration parade kicks off at the Arts Village in Government Gardens with people assembling at 4.30pm ready for a 5pm start. The parade will then travel along Hinemoa and Tutanekai streets, through the Night Market, and down Haupapa Street to Kuirau Park where it concludes with more entertainment from 5.35pm. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
