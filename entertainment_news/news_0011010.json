By India.com News Desk on October 9, 2015 at 9:00 PM Comments A popular song from the film Chachi 420 starts with the line, ‘Wake me up when you fall asleep”. In a different context, the Indian National Congress seems to have taken it seriously. Much after the concert of Ustad Ghulam Ali in Mumbai was cancelled due to threats from Shiv Sena, Congress has woken up to say that they are willing to organize the concert in Mumbai. In a statement made by former Maharashtra Chief minister Ashok Chavan, which was later tweeted by party member Sachin Sawant, he says, “Considering demand of Crores of Mumbaikars, Maharashtra Congress proposes to organise Ustad Gulam Ali ji’s concert in Mumbai.” Considering demand of Crores of Mumbaikars, Maharashtra Congress proposes to organise #UstadGulamAli ji’s concert in Mumbai – Ashok Chavan \n— Sachin Sawant (@sachin_inc) October 9, 2015 The statement came much after the concert was cancelled despite assurance of protection from Maharashtra Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis . This attempt to undo the damages of political ball-game has come far too late for the Pakistani music maestro and all the made-up “Crores of Mumbaikars”. If the Congress really wanted to help the situation, the aid should’ve come much earlier, not after assessing where the public angst is blowing. \nModified Date: October 9, 2015 9:00 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:17:09.857+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
