Clark's appointment takes effect in July, after Peter Lennie steps down as provost and returns to his faculty position.\nIn making the announcement Thursday, UR President Joel Seligman praised Clark's leadership as dean of UR's Hajim School of Engineering and Applied Sciences over the past seven years. The engineering school has more than doubled its undergraduate enrollment while the number of faculty and students in the master's program has grown.\nClark played a key role in UR's efforts to have Rochester designated as the headquarters for the American Institute for Manufacturing Integrated Photonics, a $600 million initiative.\nBut in a recent development, former Lt. Gov Robert Duffy was named to replace Clark as chairman of the AIM Photonics Leadership Council, which will help oversee the photonics center.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nDuffy to lead photonics council\nIn an email Tuesday to the leaders of the Integrated Photonics Institute of Manufacturing Innovation, Clark said he didn't know a change was imminent.\nThe change in chairman is the latest chapter in wrangling over control of the massive project.\nClark said that his appointment as provost has nothing to do with issues concerning the photonics center.\nHe is happy to be part of the efforts that have put UR on a \"great trajectory\" and that he will have even more opportunities to contribute as provost.\n\"It's an intellectual buffet. You have to work with so many different, talented individuals,\" Clark said.\nAt UR, Clark has taken on increasing responsibilities since he joined the administration in 2008 from Duke University, where he had served as senior associate dean and dean of that university's Pratt School of Engineering.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nDuffy's photonics job stirs concerns\nIn 2013, Clark was named senior vice president for research in addition to continuing to serve as Hajim school dean. With his new responsibilities, he will be stepping down as head of Hajim but will continue as senior vice president for research.\nAs provost, Clark will be responsible for advancing UR's academic, teaching and global engagement mission as well as overseeing UR's Memorial Art Gallery, information technology and other such functions as University Health Services.\nEver since Clark was named interim senior vice president for research in 2012, he has overseen various research initiatives, including the Laboratory for Laser Energetics, the Office of Research Projects Administration and UR's digital initiatives.\nJGOODMAN@Gannett", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6d9c279a1c8e1c1760366206010d933feefbf8d6/c=537-631-2507-2601/local/-/media/2015/10/12/Rochester/Rochester/635802560512572829-ROCBrd-06-14-2015-DandC-1-E001-2015-06-12-IMG-Jg-060915-Duffy-1-1-1-K6B1P4CF-L626059589-IMG-Jg-060915-Duffy-1-1-1-K6B1P4CF.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ed0efb9c46e9a056b4aa17ff5df260518c844963/c=811-0-3782-2971/local/-/media/2015/10/14/Rochester/B9319271714Z.1_20151014204128_000_GBCC8BDDJ.1-0.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T20:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:19:09.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
