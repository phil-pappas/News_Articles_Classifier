(Sinclair) to be their mobile audience data provider. By including Reveal Mobile in their roster of news and weather apps, Sinclair bolsters their sales effort potential by providing advertisers with target audiences across a nationwide presence of apps.\nReveal Mobile’s software development kit (SDK) resides inside mobile apps, allowing any app publisher or media company to understand and target their mobile audience. Their patent-pending algorithms evaluate latitude and longitude of opted-in location sharing users and which Bluetooth beacons a device encounters as it moves through the world.\nToday, Reveal Mobile has converted millions of beacon signals into a nationwide database of known beacons, covering retail, major venues, airports, restaurants and more. While traditional lat/long audiences require the app to be open and running, detecting or “bumping” beacons can occur when apps are not in use. This allows Reveal Mobile to build larger, and more accurate, location-based audiences.\n“We are competing to provide our audience and advertisers with the most relevant content and advertising across all screens,” states Rob Weisbord, Chief Operating Officer of Sinclair Digital. “Reveal Mobile offers the missing piece in mobile analytics. They give us the ability to truly understand our mobile audience; what motivates them and what they care about. The end result is a better product for our app users and sought-after audiences on mobile devices.”\n“We’ve witnessed first-hand how challenging mobile advertising has become, however a few internet giants perform remarkably well,” states Brian Handly, CEO of Reveal Mobile. “They excel due to their scale and their deep understanding of their mobile audience, which advertisers expect and demand. Reveal Mobile’s mission is to level the playing field for app publishers everywhere, providing them with detailed mobile audience analytics previously unavailable.”\nWith Reveal Mobile’s custom audience builder, Sinclair builds audiences from demographics and behavioral attributes. They can also create retargeting audiences based upon which beacons a device encounters in the real world. By installing low-cost beacons at venues or retail locations, national and local sales teams create incredibly powerful segments as their mobile audience bumps those beacons. Advertisers then retarget these known visitors with timely marketing campaigns, with the ability to measure mobile-to-store attribution.\nReveal Mobile also offers Sinclair the ability to reach sought after political audiences on mobile apps. By combining Reveal Mobile’s own data sources with publicly available third party data, they enable targeting by voting district, party affiliation, and propensity to vote.\n“This is a game-changer for our industry.” states Weisbord. “The ability to reach voters in specific districts with tailored messaging creates an incredible opportunity. We are well-positioned to lead our industry through the 2015-2016 election season and beyond.”\n“To us, Sinclair represents innovators and thought-leaders by consistently pursuing new digital strategies. We’re honored to partner with their team to supply them with mobile audience data.”\nAbout Reveal Mobile\nReveal Mobile’s audience platform provides app publishers everywhere with mobile audience data to improve product and advertising performance.
