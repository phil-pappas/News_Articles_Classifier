Lawyer: Cosby deposition lasted hours, 2nd will be sought 1  /  4 Back to Gallery BOSTON (AP) â€” The lawyer for a woman who's accused Bill Cosby of sexually abusing her at the Playboy Mansion when she was 15 says she'll seek a second deposition of the comedian.\nLawyer Gloria Allred said Saturday that Cosby appeared for a deposition in Boston on Friday that lasted several hours. Allred represents Judy Huth , who claims Cosby forced her to perform a sex act on him in the 1970s.\nAllred says Huth will be deposed on Thursday. She says a California judge will decide in December if the testimony will be made public.\nLawyers for the 78-year-old Cosby say Huth's lawsuit is frivolous and that Huth's former attorney attempted to extort Cosby.\nCosby also faces two other cases: a defamation lawsuit brought by three women who claim he abused them decades ago and a suit filed Tuesday by a model who alleges he drugged and sexually assaulted her.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T16:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:37:57.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
