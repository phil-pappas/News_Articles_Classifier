Sotheby's says it was revealed during a 2000 conservation. An inscription indicates it was intended as a gift to Manach.\nThe seller is billionaire businessman William Koch (kohk), who displayed it so it could be seen from both sides.\nHe's also selling a 1908 \"Water Lilies\" painting by Claude Monet . It's estimated at $30 million to $50 million.\nThe sale is Nov. 5.\nKoch is a 1992 America's Cup winner and brother of conservative donors Charles and David Koch.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show the correct title of the work is \"Water Lilies,\" not \"Water Lily.\"", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/40/8763403/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/40/8763403/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm"], "published": "2015-10-09T18:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:47:59.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
