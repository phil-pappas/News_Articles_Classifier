(Photo: Photo provided) \nConstellation Collective could open its doors by the end of the month. Tables inside the space were handcrafted by Tom Marchetty of The Factory. (Photo: Constellation Collective) \nIt won't be long now. \nAnyone who enjoys eating breakfast sandwiches, hand pies, scones and the like from the culinary artists of Constellation Collective has been patiently awaiting the opening of their first retail space on Haddon Avenue. (Did I mention kielbasa soaked with Exit 15 Flying Fish beer?) \nConstellation Collective is taking over the space formerly occupied by My Little Kupkake in Collingswood at 685 Haddon Ave. (That bakery owner has said she may reopen in a new location. See http://www.mylittlekupkake.com/ for updates). \nUp until now, the three owners of Constellation - Lindsey Ferguson, Valentina Fortuna and Maura Rosato - have plied their wares, everything from chicken and biscuits to goat cheese and cherry hand pies to big fresh salads at the Westmont Farmers Market, Collingswood Farmers Market, Farm & Fisherman Market + Cafe. Their baked goods are still available at Revolution Coffee Roasters down the street, although a new food purveyor will move into their former space. \nBy the end of the month, you can look for them to throw open the doors on a bright blue retail space from which they will run a retail and catering business. \nStay tuned here for much more on that. \nOr visit them Wednesday evening at the final Westmont market of the season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T02:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:50:46.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
