She is all heart. There are times when we have to control her from talking and tell her (to) think and talk (bolna padta hai soch samajhke baat kar),” Kapoor told PTI. Sooraj Barjatya’s “Prem Ratan Dhan Payo” will see Salman romance Sonam and Anil finds their pair “beautiful”. ”Both Salman Khan and Sonam are extremely good-looking and beautiful. Director Sooraj Barjatya, Salman Khan and Sonam are family people who believe in family values. There is certain innocence and smile that Sooraj, Salman and Sonam have. There is certain vulnerability in them,” he said.

I think there is no better film than this on Diwali. There is excitement and tension for every film.” Meanwhile, there have been rumours that actor Arjun Kapoor will be seen alongside his uncle, Anil in the remake version of “Chacha Bhatija”. “I don’t know about it. I am not approached for it yet,” Kapoor said. The 58-year-old actor will be seen in “Jugalbandi” that also stars Saif Ali Khan and Salman Khan. ”It is too early to talk about it. It is a dramatic film. I don’t know when we (would) start shooting for it. Nobody is in touch with me,” he added. \n  5:00 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T15:30:58.266+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
