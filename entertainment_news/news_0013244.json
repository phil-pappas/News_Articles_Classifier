Wednesday’s 3-2 loss was a mixed bag for coach Joel Quenneville to contemplate. Here are three notes and observations from the loss.\nDefense is a work in progress\nQuenneville will have to find what mix of defensive pairings he will want to stick with throughout the season. The initial results weren’t pretty early on, especially for new defenseman Trevor Daley. Daley and his partner Trevor van Riemsdyk were on the ice for two of the Rangers goals in the first period. Meanwhile, David Rundblad looked shaky with the puck at times.\n“We’ll see if we get some predictability in the line and the matchup and the defense pairings,” Quenneville said. “It’s something we’re going to explore early on in the year.”\nQuenneville said to expect Viktor Svedberg to re-join the team from Rockford.\nParain’s impressive debut\nRookie winger Artemi Panarin had quite the NHL debut, scoring a goal in the first period. If there was a bright spot on Wednesday, it was Panarin’s ability with the puck and his chemistry with center Artem Anisimov and winger Patrick Kane.\n“Emotions were kind of over the top,” Panarin said through teammate Viktor Tikhonov, who acts as Panarin’s interpreter with the media. “I was trying to remember the reactions of the crowd and got overwhelmed. I couldn’t hear anything. I was really happy.”\nQuenneville said he thought Panarin’s line was the best of the night.\nReview redux\nThe Blackhawks thought they had tied the game late when Patrick Kane appeared to have stuffed a loose puck past Rangers goaltender Henrik Lundqvist, but the officials had blown the play dead prior to the puck crossing the line. The call on the ice stood after review.\n“Quick,” was all Quenneville had to say when asked about the review after the game.\nKane said: “Seemed like they blew the whistle before the puck went in. It’s one of those plays that could probably go either way.”\nPrivacy Policy Ice Hockey Joel Quenneville New York Rangers Trevor Daley Patrick Kane Chicago Blackhawks Artem Anisimov", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561679c8/turbine/ct-joel-quenneville-chemistry-20151008"], "published": "2015-10-08T17:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:29:01.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
