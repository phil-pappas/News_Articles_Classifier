A day after the Philly rapper blasted Wale for weighing in on the feud , a clip emerged online featuring him freestyling over \"Back to Back\", which was ironically recorded by Drizzy as a diss track aimed at him. Many are assuming that Meek is making another diss song out of Drake's hit. However, his real intention is still unknown. Not much can be told based on the 15-second snippet although he's heard rapping, \"You n***as p***y.\" \"Back to Back\" is the first of two diss tracks Drake put out earlier this year after Meek accused him of using a ghostwriter. The other song \"Charged Up\" came out after Drake failed to hear anything back from his opponent, who eventually responded with the much-criticized \"Wanna Know\". Voicing his opinion on Meek's big loss, Wale earlier this week said that his fellow MMG artist \"brought a pencil to a gun fight.\" He continued, \"He ain't even bring a knife - a pencil. A piece of paper. He tried to paper cut him to death. You can't compete with somebody that got them type of relationships.\" The statement of course infuriated Meek, who then unleashed his anger in an Instagram post. He said Wale's \"not MMG NOMORE\" before telling him to \"go jump off a roof.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T09:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:57:57.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
