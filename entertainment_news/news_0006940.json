(Video via Lifetime / \"Dance Moms\" ) \nThe indictment is a result of Miller's alleged deceit that started with a 2010 petition to reorganize her dance studio. Federal prosecutors say Miller allegedly hid over $750,000 of income between 2012 and 2013. (Video via Lifetime / \"Dance Moms\" ) \nAccording to the statement from the U.S. Attorneys' Office , each count comes with a max sentence of five years in prison, or a quarter-million-dollar fine or both. \nOver the past few years, Miller has faced several lawsuits from former dancers, like Paige Hyland . That suit was dismissed in July for insufficient evidence. \nA defamation and emotional distress lawsuit from Hyland's mother, Kelly, was also thrown out in 2014. \nLifetime's cult-hit reality show will enter its sixth season in 2016. The show has been a huge stepping stone for dancers â€” most notably, 13-year-old Maddie Ziegler, who gained more popularity after starring in two of Sia's music videos.
