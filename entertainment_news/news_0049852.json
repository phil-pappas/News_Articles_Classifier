The performance, called 'Sva Kranti', was based on the Gandhian ways that women could adopt to question and ponder their role in society. There were on-stage imagined dialogues with Mahatma Gandhi, where Mallika raised some questions that are vital in any woman's journey, especially when they want to go against the established societal norms. This performance was preceded by a musical performance by city artistes Jaywant Naidu on Hawaiian guitar and Swaroop Mamidipudi on flute.
