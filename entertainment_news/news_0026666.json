Photo by Emily Smith for The Surge. 1 of 3 Order Reprint of this Story Setting the Table \nIn the wake of Greek Fest, there are probably a lot of people clamoring for more of that delicious moussaka or souvlaki. Thankfully, there is a new Greek restaurant in the area, and it’s run by a few family members who know what they’re doing. Angelo’s Mediterranean Grill may be small, but it packs a good punch. \nIn the Big Block Junction off Highway 544, Angelo’s is the most recent change for the little shopping strip, but it already has a steady flow of customers. There are only a few tables inside, plus two on the outside, so the take-out option is a popular choice. The ordering window is large enough to see into the kitchen, which gives the restaurant a personal feel and speaks of trust between the employees and guests. \nAngelo’s doesn’t have an online presence, but they hopefully will soon. Drop by between 11:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. to get some good food, except on Sundays when it’s closed. Down the Hatch \nThe menu is filled with all of the staple Mediterranean dishes that are adored throughout the world, and especially here in Myrtle Beach. There are also chicken tenders, a few versions of burgers, salads, and fries, plus a little menu for kids. \nOnce the order is in, the food is promptly put together and served, usually taking less than five minutes, even after a warning that it could take up to 10 minutes. As such, the food comes out warm and fresh. \nThe gyro, for instance, came out freshly made with an overwhelming amount of lamb on the pita. Personally, it was the first time I’ve ever eaten a gyro with a fork. The Tzatziki sauce was excellent, enjoyable even with only pita. \nSome other Mediterranean favorites, like falafel, are available as appetizers. The stuffed grape leaves with seasoned rice were served cold (as opposed to other versions filled with Greek sausage served warm), and very tasty. Even better were the spanakopita, the spinach triangles, which happen to be a personal favorite, and come out crispy on the outside with perfectly melted cheese on the inside. Check Please \nCurrently, the sides that come with sandwich and kebob platters are a choice between black beans and yellow rice or fries. The sandwiches are pretty sizable too, so the meal ends up very filling. And at $6.95 for all sandwich platters, the deal is not bad at all. \nAll the entrees come with pita, Tzatziki sauce, and a small Greek salad. The entrée menu has a lot of Greek favorites like the moussaka and spanakopita, or even something more familiar like their Greek chicken wraps. All the entrees are 10.95, so customers are still getting plenty of bang for their buck. \nDepending on if you order drinks (bottles or cans) or some baklava, a filling sandwich platter and tip can be less than ten dollars. However, if Greek food is your thing, you’ll be spending more from going back over and over again to satisfy your cravings. \nIf you eat \nWhat | Angelo’s Mediterranean Grill \nWhere | Big Block Junction, Highway 544 \nInfo | 748-9604", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T19:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T14:11:22.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
