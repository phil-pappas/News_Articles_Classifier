The main evidence points to mass animal consumption, particularly of pigs.\nFurther analysis of animal bones, conducted at the University of Sheffield, found that many pigs were killed before reaching their maximum weight. This is strong evidence of planned autumn and winter slaughtering and feasting-like consumption.\nThe main methods of cooking meat are thought to be boiling and roasting in pots probably around indoor hearths, and larger barbeque-style roasting outdoors – the latter evidenced by distinctive burn patterns on animal bones.\nBones from all parts of the animal skeleton were found, indicating that livestock was walked to the site rather than introduced as joints of meat. Isotopic analysis indicates that cattle originated from many different locations, some far away from the site.\n“Evidence of food-sharing and activity-zoning at Durrington Walls shows a greater degree of culinary organisation than was expected for this period of British prehistory,” said Dr Oliver Craig, Reader in Archaeological Science at the University of York.\n“The inhabitants and many visitors to this site possessed a shared understanding of how foods should be prepared, consumed and disposed. This, together with evidence of feasting, suggests Durrington Walls was a well-organised working community,” he said.\n 15, 2015 1:50 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T09:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:11:44.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
