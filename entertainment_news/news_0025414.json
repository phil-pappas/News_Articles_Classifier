A founder member and third president of the ANC Youth League, Pitje practised law alongside Nelson Mandela, Oliver Tambo and Walter Sisulu. During the apartheid years he represented many liberation movement stalwarts. He also represented 15-year-old Moseneke when he stood trial for conspiracy to overthrow the state in 1963.\nSpeaking just days before a row broke out in the legal profession over the virtual absence of blacks among the more than 40 lawyers in the landmark silicosis case, Moseneke said briefing patterns would always be dictated by “socioeconomic structure of a country” and “power relations within an economy”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T23:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:31:57.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
