The design enables the user to play back commercials, songs, interviews, talk shows, etc. It helps the user remember various things, such as website addresses and contact information. This eliminates the need to try to write down info while driving. The invention is designed to enhance automotive safety by minimizing distractions. Furthermore, it is easy to use.\nThe original design was submitted to the Charlotte office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
