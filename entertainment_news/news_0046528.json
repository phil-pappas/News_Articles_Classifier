Riley earned Savannah Morning News player of the week honors for his effort.\n“That was the most yards I have ever run for,” said Riley, who has 583 yards rushing, 201 yards receiving and 11 total touchdowns this season. “Our guys did a great job blocking up front, and our backs were leading me through the holes to open things up.”\nMemorial Day coach Michael Thompson said keeping a close eye on Riley in practice helped lead to the breakout performance.\n“He’s had a turf toe that has been hurting him in the past few weeks,” Thompson said. “So we told him not to make any cuts and limited him in practice last week, and it paid off. Irvin is a runner who is going to take what a defense gives him. He can run people over or run past them — he’s an impressive back.\nThe 5-foot-9, 185-pound senior is receiving recruiting interest from schools such as Army, Kennesaw State and Georgia State.\nLast season, Riley was an important part of the Blue Thunder offense — rushing for 1,036 yards and scoring 13 touchdowns as Memorial Day beat Piedmont Academy to win the GISA Class AA state championship. Thursday’s win was the second straight for the Blue Thunder (3-4 overall, 1-0 in Region 2-AA). Memorial Day has a bye week before an important region matchup with First Presbyterian in its homecoming game at Garden City Stadium on Oct. 17.\n“We have some young guys, but I think we are starting to mature as a team,” Riley said. “We’re starting to play with a different level of intensity.”\nOther top performances:\nCalvin Turner, New Hampstead — The junior threw for 125 yards and a touchdown, rushed for 55 yards and a score and caught a 50-yard touchdown pass from Jalen De La Fuente in the Phoenix’s win over Glascock County.\nSal Calderon, Calvary Day — The junior rushed for 162 yards and two touchdowns and passed for 55 yards in the Cavaliers’ win over Jenkins County.\nAndre Jackson, Savannah High — The senior rushed for 109 yards and a touchdown in the Blue Jackets’ win over Johnson.\nMelvin Smalls Jr., Jenkins — Rushed for 102 yards and a pair of touchdowns in a win over Islands.\nWesley Kennedy, Benedictine — The junior rushed for 91 yards and a pair of touchdowns in the Cadets’ win over Wayne County.\nPatrick Brown, South Effingham — The senior rushed for 123 yards and a touchdown and had 209 yards of total offense in the Mustangs’ win over Brunswick.\nAmeen Stevens, Jenkins — The sophomore rushed for 101 yards and two scores in the Warriors’ win over Islands.\nWinston Wright, Memorial Day — The freshman had a pair of interceptions in a win over Robert Toombs Christian.\nTyler Pullum, South Effingham — The senior quarterback was 10 of 14 for 151 yards with touchdown passes to T.J.
