He paid only $2. \nGuijarro just had a feeling: \"This guy is Billy the Kid,\" he told KSEE 24 . \nWho are the rest of the people in the photo? They are members of Billy's infamous gang of Regulators. \nWith only one known photograph of Billy the Kid in existence (billionaire William Koch bought it in 2011 for $2.3 million) it took Guijarro five years to authenticate it. Now, he thinks it is worth about $5 million. \nThe story of how Guijarro and his wife, Linda, were able to authenticate the photograph will be told tonight in the new National Geographic Channel show \"Billy the Kid: New Evidence.\" The program will air at 8 p.m. CST. Is this photo worth $5 million? #BillytheKid : New Evidence.
