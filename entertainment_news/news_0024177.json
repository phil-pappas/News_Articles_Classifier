'What do you feed that thing'. It's such a dad thing to say. When I found out people were hating on him for saying that, I was like, 'Are you kidding me?' What dad wouldn't be proud of that? It's not like he's saying it to an 11-year-old. I'm 21 years old.\" \nHowever, Justin admitted he was not happy when the pictures were first released online. \nHe said: \"At the end of the day, the photos, they're not terrible. I still felt like I wanted to keep that part for me, you know? ...I felt like it was a little bit of an invasion of privacy. And when I first found out about it, I was like... my heart sank.\" \nWhile Justin didn't mind his father's tweet, Bette Midler blasted Jeremy's tasteless tweet. \nCalling Jeremy a deadbeat dad in a message on her own Twitter page, she wrote: \".@justinbieber's dad tweeted he's proud of his son's penis size. I think the biggest d**k in this situation is the dad who abandoned his son (sic).\" bang showbiz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:43:42.985+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
