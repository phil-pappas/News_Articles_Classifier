Responding to the report, the music mogul has expressed his willingness to carry on the role should he is asked, claiming he would be happy to have lots of involvement in the child's life. \"If he asks, I'll do it in a heartbeat,\" the music mogul was quoted as telling USA Today (via Mirror Online). \"I haven't formally been asked yet, but if he asks me it would be my pleasure,\" he added. Days prior, it was reported that Louis wanted Simon to be his baby's godfather . HollywoodLife.com was first to come up with the claim, citing a source as saying, \"Louis has made his decision and it's 100 per cent Simon. He wants Simon to be his child's godfather.\" The source, moreover, added, \"Simon has had such an influence on him and he says Simon is a brilliant person and a brilliant father.\" Simon himself has previously offered some fatherhood advices for Louis. \"I just said, 'Enjoy it.' If I had been his age and someone had said, 'You're going to have a baby,' I'm not sure how I would have coped with it,\" he said in an interview with \"Good Morning Britain\". \"But he did call me and I said, 'When you've embraced it, you'll be amazed how much you are going to love it. It will change your life for the better.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:55:53.935+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
