Not a fan of Peter but that was ok. Still a bit stompy. Difficult dance though! Not my fave dance the rhumba. #Strictly #scd \n— Laura Nolan (@LJNolan83) October 24, 2015 \nBut it was Peter Andre’s awkward rumba that stood out amongst the Strictly fans – with his performance being moved up to the ‘early’ slot followed by a rather cringe-worthy ‘Blue Peter’ comment after the dance. People were wondering why Peter was in the first half of the show… (Guy Levy/BBC) \n— Marianka Swain (@mkmswain) October 24, 2015 \nAfter all, he has been tipped as the favourite to win. It’s like no one was really expecting him to wow everyone with his rumba (Guy Levy/BBC) Oh god, Peter Andre is doing a rumba. Engage emergency procedures (go make a cup of tea until it's over). #Strictly \n— Lynn D (@inacitylining) October 24, 2015 Oh great it's time for Peter Andre. Sorry, I meant Jeanette's time to hog the camera. Meanwhile, I might visit the bathroom. #strictly \n— Conor O'Rourke (@Conor_ORourke) October 24, 2015 Peter Andre's turn to dance… *bork* … I'm off to make a cuppa. #Strictly \n— M í k e y (@m_i_k_e_y1983) October 24, 2015 There was a lot of facepalming amongst Strictly fans (Ray Burmiston/BBC) oh my god! why is peter dancing to ed sheeran's thinking out loud?! he's gonna murder this song for me! #strictly #scd \n— Strictly Dancers (@strictlydancers) October 24, 2015 \nThe ‘Ed Sheeran & Peter Andre’ combination wasn’t really working for the fans. Then Peter went on to describe himself as ‘Blue Peter’ and Twitter cringed (Guy Levy/BBC) \n— Jenny Annuska (@jenannuska) October 24, 2015 \nPeter Andre wearing blue shirt = Blue Peter? We didn’t think so. Although a few were impressed with his dancing (Guy Levy/BBC) \n— Sarah Totty (@sarahbtotty) October 24, 2015 Good rhumba from Peter, his arms were particularly good, powerful performance, really suited him! #Strictly \n— Linda Starfish (@LindaStarfish) October 24, 2015 Lovely rumba from Peter. So romantic. Great choreography from Janette. #Strictly \n— Graceless Hippo (@Jo_Forty) October 24, 2015 So were the judges – who were far less harsh in their comments than Strictly fans (Ray Burmiston/BBC) \n“I believe you have a lot more to give,” Darcey Bussell told the Aussie singer, while Len thought he “pitched it pretty good”. \nBut all the judges agreed there were a few flawed moments, particularly with his footwork where there were as a lot of stamping rather than gliding. \n“Drag those feet, you have to caress it,” was Bruno Tonioli’s advice. \n— Houston DanceSport (@DanceSportUSA) October 24, 2015 \nNever mind though, Peter and Jeanette Manrara notched up 29 points for his performance. \n“If they tell you something you know it’s right because they are masters in their craft,” Peter said.
