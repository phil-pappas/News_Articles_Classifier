His companion, Rebecca Rodriguez, 28, also was arrested on suspicion of failure to yield with disregard to safety.\nOfficers came into contact with the pair on Thursday morning while they were driving in a vehicle that was reportedly stolen from the city of Fontana.\nAfter realizing he had been spotted, the deputy following the stolen car attempted to make a traffic stop but the vehicle failed to yield.\nThe car led the deputy on a short pursuit through business parking lots and back onto surface streets. During the chase, the driver, later identified as Rodriguez, reportedly came close to hitting pedestrians.\nThe pursuit ended when the deputy blocked the vehicle in the area of Vanderbilt Way and Carnegie Drive.\nThe passenger, later identified as Delgado, jumped out of the car and attempted to flee the area on foot, eventually entering the restaurant that contained the dining officers.\nThe officers determined his behavior was suspicious and took him into custody.", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/s-defaultcrime.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/s-defaultcrime.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:05:17.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
