(The actor who played Biff, Tom Wilson, sure seems to think that last one will happen ). The jury’s still out on whether or not the Cubs will be crowned champs (playoffs start this week), and we’re pretty glad dehydrated pizza didn’t come to fruition, but here are five things the movie got right: 1. Drones: In the movie’s 2015, drones are shown walking dogs, and in real-life 2015, we’re talking about the possibility of Amazon delivering items via drones, and there seems to be a headline just about every other week about someone flying a drone in an unauthorized area. 2. Video phone calls: In the film, an aged Marty McFly is seen talking to a co-worker via a video call… And in 2015, almost everyone is using some form of video call programs, be it Skype or Facetime. 3. Hoverboards: While hoverboards like the ones Marty and his fellow citizens of Hill Valley haven’t become widespread, the technology is here. Ax Pax launched a Kickstarter campaign last year to seek funding for its Hendo Hoverboard, and Lexus has even gotten in on the act with its design. 4. Our love for sequels: These days, it seems like pretty much every movie is a retread, and while we haven’t gotten to “Jaws 19” yet (as is shown in “Back to the Future II”), think of how many sequels “Saw” and “The Fast and the Furious” have gotten so far. 5. Fingerprint scanners: In the movie, houses are outfitted with fingerprint door locks, so you can control precisely who enters and exits without needing a key. In real-life 2015, you can indeed purchase a system for your doors that uses a fingerprint system, and some computers also use fingerprint scanning technologies.
