On Monday, Fox News shared that Southwest is now saying that they have all of the problems fixed. They had been warning everyone to show up at least two hours early to make sure that they got on their flight on time, but that doesn't need to happen now. They also wanted you to print boarding passes early, but that is not required now either.\nOn Sunday, they had about 3,600 flights and 450 of them were delayed. They had to use backup systems around the country so that they could check people in. It made a lot of people late on their flights and luckily this is all over now. There was an assumption that it might have to do with hackers, but at this time Southwest said there is no indication that hackers were behind what was going on.\nFox Business shared that Emily Mitnick, who was flying to Detroit from Denver International Airport, shared that she got there two hours early, but still missed her flight by about 15 minutes. She said there were around 1,000 people in line waiting to get their boarding passes. Luckily Southwest Airlines was able to fix the problem and things were back to normal on Monday. Hopefully they can keep this from happening again in the future.", "external_links": ["http://www.foxnews.com/travel/2015/10/12/southwest-says-problem-that-delayed-flights-sunday-is-fixed/", "http://www.foxbusiness.com/industries/2015/10/12/southwest-airlines-flights-delayed-by-tech-problems/"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:13:54.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
