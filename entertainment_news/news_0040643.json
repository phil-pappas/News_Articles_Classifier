Allred represents Judy Huth, who claims Cosby forced her to perform a sex act on him in the 1970s. \nAllred says Huth will be deposed on Thursday. She says a California judge will decide in December if the testimony will be made public. \nLawyers for the 78-year-old Cosby say Huth's lawsuit is frivolous and that Huth's former attorney attempted to extort Cosby. \nCosby also faces two other cases: a defamation lawsuit brought by three women who claim he abused them decades ago and a suit filed Tuesday by a model who alleges he drugged and sexually assaulted her.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T20:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:34:45.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
