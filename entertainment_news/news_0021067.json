Leading the orchestras would be the first violinist, known as the concertmaster. At Saturday’s concert, that honor falls to Deborah Wong , who has served in that position with the GBS since 2002. \n“I am so excited that Maestro (Eric) Jacobsen has invited me to share this evening of Mozart” with the Bridgeport audience, Wong wrote in an email. “In addition to performing my favorite Mozart Violin Concerto, No. 4 in D major, we will perform two lesser known early symphonies that are true gems and the glorious Symphony No. 29 in A major ... also one of my favorites. It is my great honor to lead the great Greater Bridgeport Symphony in this concert.” \nAlso featured will be Symphony No. 10 in G major k.74 and Symphony No. 13 in F major k. 112. \nA student of the renowned Dorothy Delay , Wong graduated from the Juilliard School with both bachelor’s and master’s degrees. In demand as a guest concertmaster, she has performed in that position with the Oklahoma Symphony, the Brooklyn Philharmonic, the American Composers Orchestra, the Westchester Philharmonic and the Northeastern Pennsylvania Philharmonic. \nThe Klein Memorial Auditorium, 910 Fairfield Ave., Bridgeport. Saturday, Oct. 17, 8 p.m. $59, $49, $39, $29. New: discounted tickets for students 18 and younger, accompanied by an adult, $10.
