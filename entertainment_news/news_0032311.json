However, a source close to the situation tells ET that the marriage rumors are not true. Paris would need the consent from her guardians, grandmother Katherine Jackson or cousin TJ Jackson, if she wants to get married because she's still a minor. According to Radar Online , Paris hopes to tie the knot with Chester when she turns 18 next April. Paris' relatives reportedly demand her to sign a prenup before she walks down the aisle to protect her father Michael Jackson 's $2 billion legacy. A family friend says, \"That's Michael Jackson's legacy and there's no way they want any part of it at risk!\" The source says family members are worrying about Paris' teen marriage because of her fragile mental state. \"It's a dilemma. Family members want Paris to get going on her prenup, but they're walking on eggshells,\" the source adds, \"They don't want to get her angry or, worse, have her cut them off.\" TJ has given his stamp of approval to Paris' relationship with Chester. TJ told ET back in August, \"No one's perfect, but he's a good boy, so I approve of him. He treats her well. She's happy. He's a teenage boy, so like any parent, guardian, step-parent or adopted parent, you got to keep an eye on him. I was a young man too once, so I keep a close eye on him.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:45:40.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
