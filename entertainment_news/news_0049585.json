The Grammy-winning rapper and Oscar-nominated actor appears on a remix of Colombian band Bomba Estereo's song, \"Fiesta.\" The remix was released digitally Friday. The collaboration marks Smith's return to music since his 2005 album \"Lost and Found.\" Smith discovered Bomba Estereo, known for its blend of Latin, tropical and electro sounds, on a recent trip to Colombia. He then asked the group to collaborate. Smith raps in both English and Spanish on the song. He recently shot a music video for the remix. \"Fiesta\" is nominated for record of the year at next month's Latin Grammy Awards. Bomba Estereo's album, \"Amanecer,\" is up for best alternative music album. Bomba Estereo members are singer Liliana Saumet, drummer AndrΘs Zea and multi-instrumentalists Simon Mejia and Julian Salazar.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:06:36.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
