If Hammel doesn't pitch in either of those, it's likely he will start Game 4, if necessary.\nJake Arrieta, as expected, will start Game 3 at Wrigley Field.\nPedro puzzled: The NLDS marks a chance for Pedro Strop to overcome past struggles at Busch Stadium, where he has allowed seven runs in five appearances covering only two innings.\n\"I don't have anything specific,\" Strop said. \"It could be just a coincidence. When I struggle, most of the time it has been here. I'm not thinking about it.\"\nStrop is one of the more emotional Cubs players but knows there's a balance in the postseason.\n\"You have to be able to control the moment, the excitement, because you do get more excited,\" Strop said. \"You have to know how to use it to your advantage instead of rushing everything.\nPitching inside: One day after Arrieta was hit intentionally by a pitch that caused both benches to empty, Cardinals Game 1 starter John Lackey stressed he would continue to pitch inside.\n\"I think everybody, even on their side, knows I'm not going to back off coming inside,\" Lackey said. \"I think I have enough of a reputation. They know what time it is.\"\nExtra innings: Shortstop Addison Russell said his left hand feels fine after jamming it on a slide into second base Wednesday. â€¦ As the minor-league coordinator for the Angels in the 1980s, Maddon said he once had a Weimaraner dog race speedy outfielder Devon White. \"The dog did win,\" Maddon said.\nPrivacy Policy Major League Baseball Kyle Hendricks Joe Maddon Pedro Strop Jason Hammel Chicago Cubs National League", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561712f4/turbine/ct-kyle-hendricks-bits-cubs-cardinals-spt-1009-20151008"], "published": "2015-10-09T04:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:55:10.711+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
