(AP) — Colleagues say an American missionary who has been working in Haiti for two decades has been fatally shot by gunmen in the country’s capital as she was behind the wheel of her car. \nThe Estes Church of Christ, based in Henderson, Tennessee, identified the slain missionary as Roberta Edwards. She ran the small Sonlight Children’s Home in Port-au-Prince. \nThe church says Edwards’ car was intentionally blocked Saturday by armed men who fired into the vehicle and killed her. They say the gunmen fled and the motive is not known. A Haitian National Police spokesman says the attackers also kidnapped a 4-year-old child from Edwards’ car. It was not immediately clear if the child was one of the roughly 20 youngsters who received foster care at the children’s home. \nBANGLADESH-PASTOR ATTACKED \n5 suspects arrested in attack on Bangladesh pastor \nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Police in Bangladesh say they have arrested five suspected members of a banned radical group for alleged involvement in an attempt to kill a Christian pastor. \nPabna district police chief Alamgir Kabir said Monday that the suspects were arrested in raids in the capital, Dhaka, and elsewhere over past few days. \nKabir said one of the five detainees is regional chief of the banned group and another was directly involved in the murder attempt. \nThe Rev. Luke Sarker, who is 52, suffered minor injuries when three men attacked him with a knife at his home on Oct. 5. The men had told Sarker that they wanted to learn about Christianity. \nThe attack took place days after the killings of two foreigners in the predominantly Muslim country. \nCONVERSION THERAPY-GOP \nRepublican lawmaker seeks ban on LGBT conversion therapy \nCONCORD, N.H. (AP) — A Republican state lawmaker is proposing legislation in New Hampshire to ban therapy aimed at changing the sexual orientation of minors, a move sure to cause friction within the GOP when lawmakers reconvene in January. \nRep. Eric Schleien (SHLINE) says he doesn’t think it’s possible to change sexual orientation, and research has led him to believe trying to do so can be dangerous. \nBut Republican state Rep. Josh Moore says he worries that the bill could make churches that preach against homosexuality subject to attacks or legal jeopardy. He also believes parents should have the right to bring their child to church in an effort to discourage homosexuality. \nSchleien said the bill doesn’t aim to clamp down on freedom of speech or religion. As for parental rights, he said sometimes there needs to be a limit. \nIf the lawmaker’s bill passes, New Hampshire would join California, New Jersey, Oregon, Illinois and Washington, D.C., in banning the practice known as conversion therapy for minors. \nHALLOWEEN CANCELED \nOutcry in Connecticut brings back canceled Halloween parades \nMILFORD, Conn. (AP) — A Connecticut city’s school system that canceled Halloween costume parades at its elementary schools has reversed its decision following an outcry from parents. \nMilford Superintendent Elizabeth Feser wrote in a letter Monday that the controversy over the annual parades was becoming a distraction. \nShe says the goal in canceling the parades had been to create a substitute Halloween celebration for families that would be inclusive of all children, including those who might not take part in the parades for religious or cultural reasons. \nAn online petition had been started asking the school district to restore the parades. \nVictoria Johannsen is the mother of a third-grader at Live Oaks School. She tells the Connecticut Post the decision to cancel was unfair to students who cherish the parades. \nPOLICE-RELIGIOUS MOTTO \nAbbott writes to AG Paxton, backs police religious mottos \nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Gov. Greg Abbott is voicing his support for a Texas police department displaying “In God We Trust” on its patrol vehicles. \nAbbott wrote to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on Monday saying “there can be no doubt” that courts would side with the Childress Police Department. Its officers have placed “In God We Trust” on vehicles amid nationally publicized tensions between law enforcement and some of the communities they serve. \nThe nonprofit Freedom From Religion Foundation asked Childress police to remove the mottos, citing separation-of-church-and-state. \nAbbott was attorney general before becoming governor in January. His letter cited legal opinions backing protections for religious freedom. \nConservative state lawmakers have asked Paxton, who has been indicted on securities fraud charges, for an attorney general’s opinion providing legal guidance on the matter. \nBRAZIL-CHRIST STATUE \nCelebration marks Christ statue’s anniversary \nRIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Hundreds of Brazilians and foreign tourists have ascended the mountain overlooking Rio de Janeiro to celebrate the 84th anniversary of Brazil’s iconic Christ the Redeemer statue. \nThe 98-foot-tall statue took 9 years to build and was opened to the public on October 12, 1931. Its perch more than 2,000 feet above the coastal city has made it a symbol of Christianity around the world. \nMonday’s anniversary celebration included a birthday cake and the singing of “Happy Birthday” in Portuguese. \nCanadian tourist Karen Southerland says she didn’t know Monday was the statue’s anniversary, but was excited to be part of the celebration. \nSound: \n179-a-12-(Karen Southerland, Canadian tourist, at anniversary celebration for Christ the Redeemer statue)-“important to Brazil”-Canadian tourist Karen Southerland says she didn’t know that Monday was the statue’s 84th anniverary.

Next month, the head of the commission, Cardinal Sean O’Malley, and two other commission members will conduct a similar workshop for the Central American bishops’ conference. \nIn both cases, officials said Monday, the bishops asked the commission for help — an important development given that bishops have long been criticized for failing to punish abusive priests in order to protect the church and prevent scandal. \nSound: \n171-a-06-(Kathleen McCormack, a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, in AP interview)-“sexual abuse is”-Kathleen McCormack, a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, says some countries need to do more to protect children from being molested.

He said it had been signed by 13 cardinals and that one of them, the Vatican’s Cardinal George Pell, had hand delivered it to Francis Oct. 5 at the start of the three-week meeting on crafting better pastoral care for Catholic families. \nThe letter complained that the meeting procedures lacked openness, that the drafting committee was appointed, not elected, and that the overall process “seems designed to facilitate predetermined results on important disputed questions.” \nBy Monday afternoon, at least four of the 13 purported signatories said they had never signed such a letter. Pell’s spokesman seemed to confirm he was behind the initiative by saying the letter was private and was supposed to stay private. \nVATICAN-HOMELESS \nVatican homeless shelter opens steps from St. Peter’s \nVATICAN CITY (AP) — The Vatican has opened its own homeless shelter that can host up to 34 men a night just steps from St. Peter’s Square. \nPope Francis’ chief charity official, Monsignor Konrad Krajewski, inaugurated the shelter Oct. 7 by celebrating Mass for the first guests and volunteers. \nThe building is owned by the Jesuits and the shelter is operated by Mother Teresa’s Sisters of Charity religious order. \nA statement Monday from Krajewski’s office said all expenses are paid for by donations and the proceeds of papal parchments sold by his office. \nIt’s the latest papal initiative to help the homeless around the Vatican. A few months ago Krajewski’s office opened showers and a free barber shop for the needy near St. Peter’s Square. \nSAUDI-HAJJ \nSaudi king reaffirms commitment to hajj after Iran criticism \nRIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Saudi Arabia’s King Salman says “irresponsible comments” and criticism from other countries over the kingdom’s handling of security during the hajj will not affect his country’s oversight of the annual Islamic pilgrimage. \nThe pilgrimage was marred by a disaster on Sept. 24 just outside Mecca that killed at least 1,480 pilgrims when two crowds converged on a narrow street, according to an Associated Press count based on official statements from nations whose citizens died. \nIranian leaders have accused Saudi Arabia, their regional rival, of mismanagement and ineptitude. \nIn an apparent reference to those comments, Salman said the kingdom “will not allow any hidden hands” to politicize the tragedy and divide Muslims. \nThe official Saudi Press Agency reported the king’s comments, which were made during Monday’s Cabinet session in the capital Riyadh.
