It was actually the first role I played in school too at the age of 8, and it sparked my love of theatre – so from the school stage to the West end was an ambition fulfilled. Promoted stories \nWhat’s your favourite musical of all time? \nLes Miserables! I had the privilege of playing Marius both on tour and in the West End of London. The music and dialogue is both moving and epic. It has a very special place in my heart. \nWhich musical would you like to appear in – what might be next? \nI would love to play Chris in Miss Saigon. \nWhat are you looking forward to performing in MAM? \nI’ve never sung anything from Jesus Christ Superstar and I am singing the amazing \"Heaven on their Minds\" in this show. I’m so looking forward to it. \nDo you get nervous before a show? \nI tend not to get too nervous these days. However, I have just had vocal surgery so I may be a little more anxious than usual. I’ve had to learn how to sing again and retraining any muscle from scratch is hard work, but I’ve worked hard and can’t wait to get started. \nTell us a funny backstage story... \nI’ve had it all: from open zips on trousers, to forgetting lyrics! But the most mortifying experience was singing the ‘Heart Full Of Love’ duet in Les Miserables with a leading lady present! She missed her entry and so I sang the song to myself! \nCan you tell us what people can expect when they come to see Mad About The Musicals? \nIt’s a show that will appeal to many people, as even if you don’t know the individual musicals, you will probably know the songs. There has been some amazing music to come out of theatre shows in the last few decades, so we will be paying homage to them. Some shows I have appeared in, and some will be new songs for me to sing, which is incredibly exciting. \nOn this tour you will be performing in theatres across the UK – are you looking forward to intimate venues and exploring new towns and cities? \nI love going on tour. I’m lucky that I still really love the job, the people and touring round the different cities. Many of these I have been to but there will also be some new places which is great. \nIt is coming up to 15 years since Pop Idol. Does it seem that long since the show and how happy are you with life just now? Share article \nSo much has happened since then. The first few years were really hectic, I toured the world — my feet didn’t touch the ground! Then I had a break, as it was really intense. Then in recent years I’ve had some great success in musical theatre, taken part in 2 series of Dancing on Ice and I play lots of gigs with my live band. I’ve also got a six year old daughter who loves coming to see the shows and I spend as much time with her as I can – she’s my priority now, I guess that’s what’s changed the most in six years. \nl For information visit: lighthousepoole.co.uk/theatre.
