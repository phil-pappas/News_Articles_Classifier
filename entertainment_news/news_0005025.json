They were inspired by their mother, who died from cancer last year. \nDempsey is best known as Dr. Derek \"McDreamy\" Shepherd on TV's \"Grey's Anatomy,\" but he left the show earlier this year. He's also filming the movie \"Bridget Jones's Baby\" in London. \n___ Rate this This article has not yet been rated. We want you to tell us what you think of our articles.
