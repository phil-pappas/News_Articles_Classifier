We were a country without New Mexico, Arizona, Alaska and Hawaii. \n1986: 50 \nThe winner: New York. It’s not even close. \nHot dog \nCHICAGO-STYLE VS. N.Y. CLASSIC \nThe debate: In Chicago, that dog balances an entire garden on top with yellow mustard, sweet green pickle relish, onion, tomato wedges, pickle spear, sport peppers, and celery salt on a poppy seed roll. New York revels in its simplicity with a Nathan’s hot dog topped with a little spicy brown mustard and sauerkraut. \nThe winner: New York, if only because there are fewer toppings to fall on people’s shirts. \nTourist attraction \nWILLIS TOWER VS. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING \nThe debate: The Sears Tower (Ok, it’s really named the Willis Tower now but no one calls it that) is 108 stories, 1,730 feet (with antenna), outreaching the Empire State Building at 102 stories and 1,454 feet with antenna. And, sure, Ferris Bueller visited the Sears Tower on his day off and Batman stood atop it in “The Dark Night,” but King Kong climbed the Empire State Building and Cary Grant waited hours for Deborah Kerr there. \nThe winner: New York. A giant gorilla swatting at planes? Cary Grant waiting for the love of his life? We love New Yorker Matthew Broderick, but not that much. \nBuy this photo Charles Rex Arbogast Actor Bill Murray waves to the crowd before throwing out a ceremonial first pitch at a Cubs game in 2012.

METS FANS JERRY SEINFELD, CHRIS ROCK, KEVIN JAMES, JON STEWART \nThe debate: This is the toughest call of them all and it probably comes down to Murray vs. Seinfeld. \nThe winner: Chicago and Murray. Hey, it’s a Cinderella story. \nFrank Sinatra song \nMY KIND OF TOWN VS. NEW YORK, NEW YORK, \nThe debate: Mets fans might even vote for Chicago in this one, as “New York, New York” is forever linked to that other N.Y. team and played after every Yankees victory at home. \nThe winner: Chicago. Sinatra says “it won’t let you down” and the song’s not nearly as irritatingly overplayed and quoted. \nBuy this photo Dave Pickoff In this Sept. 9, 1969, file photo, a black cat stands in front of the Chicago Cub�s dugout during the first inning of a baseball game against the New York Mets in New York.

The Cubs were up two games to one and had four home games to play. But when William “Billy Goat” Sianis wasn’t allowed to bring his pet into the park, he allegedly cursed the team and said it would never win again as long as his goat was banned. The Cubs lost that game and the series — and haven’t won since. \nIn September 1969, as the Cubs were in the process of losing a huge division lead to the Mets, a black cat appeared on the field at Shea Stadium, walked past a Cubs player in the on-deck circle, in front of the Chicago dugout before running away. The Cubs finished their collapse and the Miracle Mets won the World Series. \nThe winner: New York. Not only aren’t the Mets cursed, the goat’s name? Murphy. Mets fans hope it’s a name that continues to haunt Cubs fans this year thanks to their playoffs-star-so-far Daniel Murphy. \nEmail: yoriok@northjersey.com © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T22:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:46:18.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
