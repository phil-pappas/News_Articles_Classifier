The song flows from one musical theme to another and is heavy on instrumentation; a grandiose fusion of extravagant sounds. This is followed by Auna Neevena sung by Hariharan and Sadhana Sargam; a song that touches the depths of emotions with the help of a dramatic string section. The singers elevate the track to another level. The next song Choosukovo Teesukovo sung by Baba Sehgal and Chitra has a peppy groove and has a mass style to it. Unfortunately, it fails to impress and does not have a catchy element or hook to it. Punnami Puvvai sung by Shreya Goshal is a quirky and melodious track with a lot of beautiful transitions that leaves you reminiscing of some of Ilayaraja's classics. Shreya Goshal's voice perfectly complements the track. Allakallolamai sung by SP Balasubrahmanyam is as magnificent as it gets, and starts off with a flurry of chenda drums from Kerala. SPB's voice sounds majestic. Anthapuramlo sung by Chitra, Sadhana Sargam and Chinmayi somehow doesn't do enough justice compared to the other songs. The album is a nostalgic reminder of Ilayaraja's style of composing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:46:31.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
