This month marks the culmination of the first full year’s worth of winners and outstanding pieces of art. To give American Frame customers a chance to consider all the winners one more time, and choose a favorite among them, this month’s contest featured the year’s best in a competition with each other. Voters chose photographer Jaime Johnson as the champion.\nNature is one of the most popular subjects for artists and art buyers, so it is little surprise that Johnson’s work appeals so widely. A native of Mississippi, she grew up surrounded by the beauty of nature and eventually brought her talent and interest in the photographic arts to its many enchantments: rain, birds in flight, the special gray light reflected off a bayou. Johnson’s formal training includes a B.F.A. from the University of Mississippi and an M.F.A. in Photography at Louisiana Tech University. She recently won the Grand Prize in the Maine Media Workshops international contest “Character: Portraits and Stories that Reveal the Human Condition.” She was also named a finalist for the “2014 Clarence John Laughlin Award.” Her work has appeared in publications such as Light Leaked, Muybridge's Horse, and Seites and been shown at venues such as the SOHO Photo Gallery in New York, the Center for Fine Art Photography in Fort Collins, Colorado, and the New Orleans Photo Alliance in New Orleans, Louisiana.\nIn the winning work, “Rain,” Johnson has transformed the familiar site of falling rain into something entirely new. The pink rain conjures a sense of dreaming and asks the viewer to consider the magic of light and the subjectivity of color. A very narrow black frame such as American Frame’s Standard with no mat or an unframed canvas would serve as perfect complements to the sense of floating the image creates.\nTo contact Jaime Johnson or follow her work, visit her American Frame gallery and her website .\nAbout American Frame\nAmerican Frame provides professional-quality DIY custom picture framing supplies and fine art printing services at wholesale prices direct to the consumer.
