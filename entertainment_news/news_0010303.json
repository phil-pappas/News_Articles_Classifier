I have tons and tons and tons of unpublished material. I'm going to be like Dorothy Parker when I die. People are going to go, 'Holy shit, it's totally indecipherable.'\"\nShe had previously spoken to The Independent (UK ) about her detective novel last year, which is set in London. \"[It] starts in London by St Giles' Church in Covent Garden. I can honestly say I was just sitting outside the church, there were a lot of homeless people about, daydreaming, and this story just came into my head,\" she said. \"It's made me so nostalgic for that area, I don't see me walking there when I think of that spot, though; I think of my detective. I'll finish when I finish. I'm working on three books so it's like a horse race - whichever crosses the line first will get published. I love to write; it's my first vocation.\"\nSmith' s last studio album was 2012's ' Banga ', although she still tours and played Dublin's RHK earlier this year.\nMORE: Patti Smith's memoir 'Just Kids' is being turned into a TV series by US network Showtime\nMORE: Watch: Patti Smith and Glastonbury sing Happy Birthday to the Dalai Lama", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/xxygqSTO1lQ"], "published": "2015-10-07T20:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:34:36.666+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
