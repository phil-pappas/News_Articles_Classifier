He looks like a killer, he really does.\" \nBut despite waving goodbye to the heavily sought-after role almost 30 years ago, Sir Roger has admitted he'd love to make a return as the new \"geriatric\" MI6 agent in the future. \nAsked who he thinks should be the next actor to take control of the luxury tuxedo and hand gun, he said with a smirk: \"Why don't they have a geriatric 007, I'll come back!\" \nMeanwhile, Daniel, 47 - who has portrayed the spy for nearly a decade - recently revealed he's ready to quit the franchise after the upcoming movie 'SPECTRE' hits screens. \nAsked if he wants to play the leading role again, he said: \"I'd rather break this glass and slash my wrists. No, not at the moment. Not at all. That's fine. I'm over it at the moment. We're done. All I want to do is move on.\" \nHowever, although the handsome star is adamant he's ready to wave goodbye to the franchise, he has claimed he has signed a contract that may require him to make another. \nHe said: \"It's getting harder. But such is life. I'll keep going as long as I'm physically able. I'm contracted for one more - but I'm not going to make predictions.\" bang showbiz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:20:13.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
