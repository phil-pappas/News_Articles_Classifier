Steppenwolf for Young Adults conjures a “1984” for the 21st century Hedy Weiss on October 25, 2015 \nMany of the high school students who come to see Steppenwolf Young Adults’ chilling, hard-hitting stage adaptation of George Orwell’s “1984” were not even born when the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks ushered in a whole new geopolitical era. And painfully few probably have any real understanding of the roots of Orwell’s classic work, first published in 1949, when the world was still grappling with both the full horror of the Nazis’ engineering of the Holocaust and the massive internal purges undertaken by the Soviet Union’s Josef Stalin. \nJust how much they might or might not understand about 20th and 21st century history, and about the ever more sophisticated forms of surveillance now being practiced worldwide – something that goes far beyond their parents’ warnings about how Facebook and other social media platforms can become ineradicable records of personal behavior – also is up for question. \nSo their teachers had better be prepared for a great many questions and a whole lot of explaining about these things – all of which bedevil even the most knowledgeable adults these days. It will not be easy. At a moment when classic forms of propaganda, as well as extreme political correctness, can combine to create a pernicious effect on free speech, rational thought and necessary action, they might just find themselves treading on thin ice at every turn.

And the combination of Andrew White’s incisive adaptation (revised since it was first performed by Lookkingglass Theatre in 2004), Hallie Gordon’s lean but emotionally-driven direction, and a cast of eight actors who never flinch, is sure to have the adults who attend the show’s public performances pondering as many questions as the kids. \n‘1984’ Run time: 90 minutes with no intermission \nAt the center of “1984” is Winston Smith (Adam Poss in a superbly measured performance). A clearly thoughtful and notably anxious young man who is still in touch with his uncorrupted boyhood (fine work by Matthew Abraham, touching in his oversized manly garb), Winston is out of synch with the oppressive regimentation of speech, thought and action unequivocally demanded in the nation of Oceania. But as an employee of the Ministry of Truth, he is compelled to erase all language and behavior not deemed to serve the state – a state that is in a continual state of war, and that suppresses all individuality (and memory) through an intense system of electronic surveillance operated by Big Brother.

Not surprisingly, paranoia and betrayal is everywhere. Misguided trust can prove fatal. Love is a subversive act. Speaking about the past is forbidden. (In an update here, any suggestion of the former existence of glaciers suggests the consequences of climate change denial, and a snow globe becomes a treasured “forbidden” object because it calls to mind a time when December temperatures were not in the summer range.) \nAlthough Winston is forever in a state of suppressed rebellion, it is only when he falls in love with a co-worker, Julia (a deftly sensual Atra Asdou), already in an underground movement, that he joins in dissent. He meets with O’Brien (an ideally icy and seductive Lance Baker), a member of the powerful Inner Party who he believes to be a member of the counter-revolutionary resistance, and is even given a volume of the works of Goldstein, the loathed anti-Big Brother theorist. Of course O’Brien is not at all who he appears to be, and Winston becomes the target of the most brutal torture. \nIf there is a problem here it is that “1984” deals in a fictional landscape that allows audiences to plug in whatever moral equivalents they see fit. As anyone who saw Ron Keaton’s recent one-man show, “Churchill,” will understand, there are times when taking a stand against a very real enemy is crucial. \nElizabeth Birnkrant plays the perfectly unctuous overseer of the Ministry; Tyrone Phillips is most touching as a secret poet; Dennis William Grimes is an ideal double agent; and Manny Buckley is the indoctrinated Everyman. \nCollette Pollard’s superb set (expertly lit by Amanda Clegg Lyon) features a wall punctuated by file drawers and also serves as the backdrop for vivid projections of electronica, a battle-scarred city and much else (the work of designer Joseph A. Burke and photographer Joel Moorman). The designer of the rat cage is not credited, but should be. Like everything else in “1984,” it is harrowing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T22:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T22:34:38.048+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
