Eugenio Villareal (Photo by Rowena Tan)\nAfter women’s rights group Gabriela aired concern on receiving complaints against noontime show “It’s Showtime” for supposedly “pimping Pastillas Girl to various interested men,” Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB) chairman Atty. Eugenio Villareal said they will have a dialogue with ABS-CBN bosses next week to discuss the issue.\nIn an interview with Bulletin Entertainment , Villareal said he already sent an invitation to the show’s producers, urging them to meet with the board’s Gender and Development committee.\n“Pag-uusapan at bibigyan natin ng pagkakataon na magprisinta ng explanation ’yung nasabing palabas. So titingnan muna natin ’yung gender sensitivity issues and then after that titingnan natin kung ano magiging (hakbang natin),” he said.\nVillareal explained it is MTRCB’s impetus to empower viewers to be more discerning of what they watch on TV.\n“Kailangan kasi nilang malaman kung ito ay age appropriate or ’yung message ba na napapanood nila sa TV ay tama. Kasi (para sa) kapakanan din naman ng kabataan itong ginagawa natin,” he explained.\nFuture plans\nThe Ateneo de Manila University law professor divulged they will continue making infomercials aimed to help lessen violence on TV and in movies.\n“Gusto nating magabayan ang ating mga kababayan about sa violence. Patuloy din ang pakikipag-usap natin sa iba’t-ibang ahensiya para magkaroon tayo ng memorandum of understanding,” he said.\nVillareal encourages the public to be vigilant in monitoring TV programs and movies shown on television, in cinemas and even on public transport systems, like buses and ferries. He said movies shown inside the vehicles should have been properly reviewed and evaluated by the MTRCB.\n“Hangga’t maari kasi dapat rated G (for all ages, which also covers trailers, publicity material in all media) at PG (Parental Guidance) ang pwedeng ipalabas. Hindi pwedeng nagpapakita ng violence and there should be no lewd movies shown to passengers,” he said.\nAs MTRCB chairman, Villareal spearheads the information campaign “Matalinong Panonood Para Sa Pamilya Ni Juan At Juana” which aims to let people understand how the MTRCB ratings system works.\nFor movies, the current film ratings are PG-13 (parental guidance for children below 13 accompanied by adult), R-13 (for ages 13 up), R-16 (for ages 16 up), R-18 (strictly 18 up) and X (not for public viewing).\nMTRCB has also launched its 30th Anniversary Commemorative book which chronicles the agency’s history since its creation in 1985.\n“We could see that it has also metamorphosed into a developmental agency because it has been there to mandate and guide the people,” he said.\nAngelica Jane Yap a.k.a. Pastillas Girl (Twitter)\nVillareal said they are currently making arrangements with bookstores to make the book available to the public.\nMeanwhile, Villareal doesn’t want to enter politics the way his predecessor, Sen. Grace Poe, has done. He just wants to focus on his work and continue teaching.\n“Tapusin muna natin ’yung MTRCB ika nga. At saka ito ay isang unique na trabaho at masaya ako at nabigyan tayo ng pagkakataon para maglingkod,” he said.\nFamily man\nLike many people, Villareal loves watching TV shows and movies with his family.\n“Every now and then ay nanonood kami ng pelikulang Pilipino bilang pamilya. Para kasi sa akin, priority ko pa rin ang pamilya ko maski gaano pa ako ka-busy,” he said.\nVillareal maintained he is not strict with his children.\n“Kailangan palagi kang involved sa mga ginagawa nila pero hindi naman ’yung parang sinasakal mo na sila. Parang pwede kayo maging magkaibigan,” he said.\nAsked what his wife and kids say about his job, Villareal answered, “’Yung youngest ko palagi niyang sinasabi na proud siya sa akin. ’Yung second naman palaging nakikipag-argue kung bakit binigyan ko ng ganyang rating ’yung isang film. My wife naman is just quiet and supportive about it.”", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:01:48.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
