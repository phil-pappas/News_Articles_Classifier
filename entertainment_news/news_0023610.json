Twenty-one years, 10 albums and 35 million record sales later, it's evident the answer from music fans was a resounding \"yes.\" \n\"We set out to create something that was super raw and emotional with no filter,\" guitarist James \"Munky\" Shaffer said of Korn's pioneering first effort. \"We didn't care about being on the radio. None of that mattered. We just wanted to create an album that was pure.\" \nKorn will perform its first album in its entirety on Tuesday in Montclair. \"This is a good way to let our fans from the beginning know that we haven't forgotten about them,\" Shaffer said, \"and that we're grateful and appreciative that they're still around.\" \nThe Bakersfield, Calif., band's debut established a new sound that came to be known as Nu metal for its aggressive mix of elements of metal, hip-hop, grunge and alternative. \"Korn\" featured rumbling, low-end guitars and bass, singer Jonathan Davis' angst-ridden, half-rapped, half-sung vocals, and guitar squeals that mimicked sounds heard on discs by rap groups like Cypress Hill. \nStandout tracks include album-opener, \"Blind,\" \"Shoots and Ladders\" and \"Divine.\" Korn crafted their unique sound in part by using 7-string guitars and 5-string basses to take standard guitar tuning down an octave. \n\"We're extremely proud of what we created,\" Shaffer said. \"As the recording process progressed we realized it wasn't like anything we had heard. \n\"That album really was a gateway for many people who didn't necessarily like heavy bands to explore heavy music,\" he said. \"We pulled our inspiration from a variety of bands like Sepultura, Faith No More, Rage Against the Machine and the Red Hot Chili Peppers.\" \n\"Korn's\" conclusion is its most intense moment. Following final song, \"Daddy\" — about Davis' parents doubting his childhood confession that he was being sexually abused — the singer is heard sobbing in the studio for nearly four minutes. The gut-wrenching moment was unrehearsed, Shaffer said. \n\"We were just in awe,\" he said. \" 'Were we supposed to go comfort him or let him do his thing?' \" There was a bit of confusion. In the end we said, 'let's just stay out of there and let him get through it.' \" \nKorn's unique sound spawned a movement that included a litany of bands like Slipknot, Machine Head, Limp Bizkit, Coal Chamber and Static-X. Shaffer said that he is now honored by his band's influence, though he was not as thrilled in the beginning. \n\"At first we didn't like that all these bands were coming out with a similar sound,\" Shaffer said. \"It was a sound we had worked on and held very close. It took about three or four years to start thinking, 'this is kind of cool that other bands are doing it. It's flattering.'\" \nIn addition to Shaffer and Davis, Korn's debut included guitarist Brian \"Head\" Welch, bassist Reginald \"Fieldy\" Arvizu and drummer David Silveria, who left in 2006. Drummer Ray Luzier came onboard in 2009 after a series of temporary fill-ins. \nShaffer said that revisiting Korn's first album has given the band a chance to reflect on how they've matured over the past two decades. \"You can see the growth in the songwriting and how we've changed so much as people,\" he said. \"We have families and responsibilities now, but once we start writing, our focus is still on making great music.\" \n\"Korn\" hit No. 72 on the Billboard Top 200 albums chart, and the band made its name through constant touring, including an opening slot for Ozzy Osbourne, and airplay on metal radio. Their hard work paid off when sophomore effort, \"Life Is Peachy\" (1996) hit No. 3.
