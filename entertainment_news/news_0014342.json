What would he do when he's confronted with a huge dilemma: his state senator wife who's running for governor of California centers her political platform on privacy issues in this digital age; and the victim's very wealthy, influential and powerful husband threatens him if he presents the video evidence to the police? Author Pete Liebengood's newly published lighthearted political thriller, Accidental Droning , is an entertaining novel that gathers an interesting mix of characters who will do anything and everything for money, politics, revenge – and perhaps, love.\nFormer country club golf shop manager Bo Granger turned to flying his private hobby drone as a pastime. When his drone accidentally captured footage of a man drowning a woman in a pool in their very private, exclusive neighborhood, he didn't realize that it would spark up a series of misadventures for him. He would be nearly shot to death by a hit man hired by the dead woman's husband; be falsely accused of sexual abuse by his wife's housekeeper; and be involved in a torrid affair with a journalist.\n\"An enjoyable romp of a political backstabbing and manipulation.\" – Kirkus Reviews\n\"... an entertaining setup for a comedic cast of characters that wreak havoc on themselves and each other as they try to navigate self-serving interests with the (rarely invoked) greater good.\" – Clarion Review, Foreword\n\"... a mystery that is packed with unexpected twists, turns, and influences throughout...\" – Donovan's Bookshelf\nThis book is available online and can be purchased at www.amazon.com and www.barnesandnoble.com .\nAbout the Author\nPete Liebengood is a retired TV sportscaster (KCRA-TV Sacramento, KRON-TV San Francisco).
