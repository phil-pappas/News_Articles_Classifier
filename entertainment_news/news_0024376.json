The Muslims who have been regular participants in the holy re-enactment will not be allowed to play the role of revered figures such as Lord Ram, Laxman, Sita and Hanuman. The reason behind this sudden imposition is that the members of minority community eat meat, and therefore it would be disrespectful if they enact Gods. \nThe Ramlila is conducted in the Muslim neighbourhood of Mumtaznagar. A number of members including one of the event organizer Baldhari Yadav have objected to the role of holy figures handed to Muslims. “Women spectators worship the feet of actors playing Ram, Sita, Laxman, etc. Since, they eat meat it is disrespectful. Although, Hindus too are non-vegetarians, they give up eating meat during Navratri,” he said.

When we came to know about the objections, we eased them out,” he was quoted as saying by TOI. \n( Representational Image) \n  3:10 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T12:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:49:06.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
