He sought them out via social media -- and he found them, all right.\nThe results of his seven-state, 26-city search are now available on multiple video on-demand platforms, and two true Mobile legends are among those featured.\nFor those who aren't familiar with the brand, North Carolina-based Cheerwine is a 98-year-old soft drink company that remains family-owned. Cheerwine is red in color, with cherry and vanilla flavors and extra carbonation.\nStevenson interviewed Wayne Dean, a retired minister and actor who has portrayed Joe Cain as Chief Slacabamorinico for the past 31 years, at the bar at Callaghan's Irish Social Club in Mobile's Oakleigh Garden District.\nHere's their conversation:\nLegendary Locals from FilmBuff on Vimeo .\nHe also ate lunch at the Dew Drop Inn, considered to be Mobile's oldest restaurant, where owner Powell Hamlin wore a Cheerwine T-shirt for the occasion. Stevenson even got to go into the kitchen with Hamlin as he fixed the Dew Drop's locally famous hot dogs and onion rings.\nThe Dew Drop opens the \"No Leftovers\" episode:\nNo Leftovers from FilmBuff on Vimeo .\n\"We may not have the multi-million-dollar ad budgets of the bigger brands, but we know that the stories of authentic, unique, independent, family-owned businesses are powerful enough to inspire people nationwide and in doing so gain support for our brand through our purpose,\" Tom Barbitta, senior vice president of marketing for Cheerwine, said in a news release.\n\"Cheerwine is a true 'brand of the people,' and we hope the series demonstrates our love of community and real people.\"\nOnce the episodes were complete, Cheerwine partnered with FilmBuff , a leading distributor of independent films and documentaries. \"The beauty of branded entertainment is that it levels the playing field,\" said Janet Brown, CEO of FilmBuff. \"What matters to audiences is the quality of the story. That can come just as easily from a beloved family-owned company like Cheerwine as a large multinational corporation. The Local Legend Project has a powerful message, and we look forward to sharing it with audiences across the globe.\"\nThe docu-series is available for free download on iTunes, VIKI, Vimeo, Amazon Instant Video, Google Play, Dailymotion and Vessel.\nOther Alabama legends featured include Gip's Place in Bessemer and Archibald's BBQ in Tuscaloosa.\nFor more information about The Local Legend Project, or to nominate one of your own, visit cheerwine.com/locallegends .", "external_links": ["https://player.vimeo.com/video/140474216", "https://vimeo.com/140474866", "http://cheerwine.com/locallegends", "https://vimeo.com/filmbuff", "http://www.filmbuff.com/", "http://www.cheerwine.com/", "https://vimeo.com/140474216", "https://player.vimeo.com/video/140474866"], "published": "2015-10-13T05:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:35:18.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
