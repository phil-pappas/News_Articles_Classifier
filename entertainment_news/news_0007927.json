The \" Guardians of the Galaxy \" star followed comedian Billy Eichner who went out to ask people on the street the name of the famous actor. A sneak peek from the upcoming episode of TruTV's \"Billy on the Street\" shows Eichner offering people one dollar if they can name Pratt correctly. The ambush proves that many New Yorkers lack entertainment knowledge. One person said he was Chris Evans and Eichner got exasperated. A group of elderlies obviously did not know who Pratt was and when Eichner told them it was Josh Duhamel , they bought it. A man even took a random answer, saying Pratt was \"from VH1.\" One woman finally got it right and said she liked his wife Anna Faris . But when Eichner told her she's on TV show \" Mom \", she went blank about it. The full episode airs Thursday, October 15 at 10:30 P.M. on TruTV. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:11:46.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
