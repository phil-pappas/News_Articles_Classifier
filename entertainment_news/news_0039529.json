He was the trial's final witness.\nThe notes are from a 1957 love ballad written by composer Baligh Hamdi and appear throughout \"Big Pimpin',\" which was Jay Z's first major hit. Producer Timbaland paid $100,000 in 2001 to settle a claim about its usage.\nLawyers for Hamdi's nephew, Osama Ahmed Fahmy, contend that Jay Z and Timbaland do not have a valid right to use the song.\nClosing arguments are tentatively scheduled to begin Wednesday but the judge must settle several issues first.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
