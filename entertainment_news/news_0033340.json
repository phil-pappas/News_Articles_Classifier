Or rather, Boy oh Girl! What a fun experience watching the cast of characters in the Democratic Presidential debate. After putting up with all the derisive comments and reading all the liberal's letters to the editor blasting the Republican Presidential contenders, including one fellow who called them \"clowns,\" I was quite amused at last night's \"Circus in Las Vegas!\" Just needed 3 rings and a juggler to qualify! Hillary and Bernie, and the three podium fillers, Loonie, Happy, and Stiffy. Where did they get these three guys?\nTalk about divisive? All Hillary did was further escalate the confrontational divide between Republicans and Democrats, probably making it harder to accomplish anything in Congress. Good strategy: Dividing America even more than Obama has already.\nTalk about \"pie in the sky?\" WHO is going to pay for all of Bernie's socialist programs, \"free college educations,\" and more spending? And all the time, the live viewing audience applauded, as if saying, \"Yes, yes, we all want more free stuff, make the wealthy pay for everything!\"\nWell, it ain't gonna happen! America cannot afford a Socialist or another Democratic President who will continue to further bankrupt our nation with poor fiscal management, and yet more reckless spending. Its nice to talk freebies, but our National Debt is at a record high, enough (thank you Mr. Obama, our current Democratic President)!\nAny one of the Republican Presidential candidates is more qualified to be our President, as they all have proven track records of accomplishments, unlike last night's \"circus performers.\" And at least the Republicans answer tough questions, again, unlike flip-flopping Hillary, who only responds with anything BUT truthful answers (just ask Congressional investigators, or the FBI).\nEight years of a Democratic Presidency is enough! Time for a change!\nBob Bolier MORE FROM Editorial The elephant in the room Jim Ryan Jr., blogger | 9:28 AM Oct 13, 2015 Show Me The Smile Andrea Raethka, ROC | 4:48 PM Oct 6, 2015 Choose to Change Gun Laws Andrea Raethka, ROC | 11:48 PM Oct 2, 2015 See all posts from Blogs Extra", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T21:57:13.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
