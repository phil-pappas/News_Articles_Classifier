Her mixed media mobiles depict pollution of air, ice and waters; her oils of endangered animals' eyes reveal the cause of their demise in the center of each pupil. \n“My art often reflects my concern about climate change and how we are living in a non-sustainable way that impacts all life on the planet,” she said. \nA multi-faceted artist, she works with wire, bronze and resin to create a wide assembly of animals, wild or domesticated. When she operated her own Outside in Designs business she designed a whimsical line of animal sculpture for the gift industry. Today she works with copper and other metals to fabricate kinetic outdoor sculptures, among other forms of art. \nThis show will close Nov. 23. The Sanctuary Gallery is open Mondays through Thursdays from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.; Fridays from 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. or by appointment — call 594-8656. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
