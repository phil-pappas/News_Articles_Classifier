Among the numerous guests were the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) of Britain and Ireland general-secretary Michelle Stanistreet and South African National Editors’ Forum director and former City Press editor Mathatha Tsedu .\nFrom South Africa, 86-year-old fellow treason trialist Leon Levy and retired constitutional court judge Albie Sachs were among those who sent messages included in a \"birthday book\" of remembrances.\nKnown locally for the most part as a trade union activist, former president and honorary NUJ life member, Morrison was arrested 49 years ago, aged 21, and charged with treason along with 155 other South Africans.\nHis arrest came just six days after completing three months of a four-month sentence for painting slogans on walls in Cape Town. Inspired by the adoption of the Freedom Charter in 1955, he painted \"Let us Black folk in\" on a wall in the parliamentary precinct and \"The People Shall Govern\" on another nearby wall.", "external_links": ["http://www.Whoswho.co.za/hover.php?uid=5369", "http://whoswho.co.za/mathatha-tsedu-4539", "http://www.Whoswho.co.za/hover.php?uid=4539", "http://whoswho.co.za/albert-sachs-5369"], "published": "2015-10-12T21:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:47:00.279+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
