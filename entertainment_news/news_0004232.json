His albums include The Pleasure Principle, Replicas and Telekon.\n\"Sound is the thing that has always excited me the most, it's why discovering electronic music a lifetime ago was such a life-changing moment for me,\" he said.\n\"I create sounds, noises, and then try to turn those noises into music, and that can be a challenge. To be recognised as innovative in that is really quite special.\"\nHaving taken place annually since 1990, the Q Awards - run by the monthly music magazine - will be hosted today by Absolute Radio's Christian O'Connell.\nOther winners of the Innovation In Sound prize include last year's winner, Jean Michel Jarre, and in previous years Underworld, Mark Ronson, Sonic Youth, Massive Attack, Sigur Ros, The Prodigy and Muse.\n\"It's been a while since I've heard anything strikingly unusual in terms of sound in mainstream music,\" Numan said.\nShare article \"Plenty of cool stuff in film score music, of course. Sound design in that area is quite phenomenal. I did think the latest Prodigy album had some amazing noises though, loved a lot of that.\"\nLast year's winners at the awards included Sam Smith, Ed Sheeran, Jamie xx, Kasabian, Pink Floyd and Culture Club.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-19T18:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:31:02.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
