The Kent-Trumbull campus is at 4314 Mahoning Ave. NW. \nSet in St. Louis in 1937, “The Glass Menagerie” draws its action from the memories of the narrator, Tom Wingfield, an aspiring poet who works in a shoe warehouse to support his mother and sister. Though the drama speaks to the post-World War I generation of its setting, it has a timeless quality that reaches audiences today. \nThe play is considered Williams’ best-known work, and Tom Wingfield is viewed as his most autobiographical character. \nDirected by Jim Canacci, the cast of the Kent-Trumbull production includes David Ruple as Tom Wingfield, Auggie Heschmeyer as Jim O’Connor, Hannah Gillespie as Laura Wingfield and Susan MonteCalvo as Amanda Wingfield. \nTickets are $10 ($8 for students and seniors, $6 for children 12 and under). Kent State Trumbull students receive free admission with a valid ID. \nFor information or tickets, call 330-675-8833, or email trumbullboxoffice@kent.edu .
