I didn’t want to keep fighting over millions of dollars that, frankly, due to two franchises, I don’t need.”\nShe continued, “I would be lying if I didn’t say there was an element of wanting to be liked that influenced my decision to close the deal without a real fight. I didn’t want to seem ‘difficult’ or ‘spoiled.’”\nGender pay gap ... leaked Sony emails revealed Jennifer Lawrence was paid far less than her male counterparts in American Hustle. The 25-year-old Oscar winner added that her compensation seemed fine until she learned what her male co-stars were making.\n“This could be a young person thing,” she said. “I’m sure it’s both. But this is an element of my personality that I’ve been working against for years, and based on the statistics, I don’t think I’m the only woman with this issue.”\nStar power ... Jennifer Lawrence at the Oscars in 2014. The Hunger Games star wonders if there’s a lingering habit of women afraid to express their opinions in the least offensive way to men.\nOther Stories The horror of MH17’s final 90 seconds News 0 comments Who were Playboy’s Aussie stars?

I don’t think I’ve ever worked for a man in charge who spent time contemplating what angle he should use to have his voice heard. It’s just heard.”\nShe then recalls a second hacked email calling Angelina Jolie a “spoiled brat.” Then it hits Lawrence, “For some reason, I just can’t picture someone saying that about a man.”\nJ.Law writes for Lenny This story originally appeared in The New York Post.\nOriginally published as Why J-Law ‘gave up’ on making money", "external_links": ["http://www.lennyletter.com/", "https://instagram.com/p/8x6XYXxPiZ/embed", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/47d0ba3dcfc7d0e1945efb38c38f5fd8", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/54f8f8ec1bc8014fc19f7c8fdcf049fd?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e2d7e313b4900eed98c081181a2af8b2?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c425d8e603a72200be1a612f0e2f9ce2", "http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/why-jennifer-lawrence-gave-up-trying-to-make-more-money/story-fn907478-1227568203061?sv=55dae247d484dd490b53d98f2f84ab51", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/29aa8c9e7df2fc3d60f1cedc5efbb1b7", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/4239c7afe20d17751cdd8315329319d8", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0b6982a1678b0da22950bcaee37eaf7c", "http://pagesix.com/2015/10/13/why-j-law-gave-up-trying-to-make-more-money/?_ga=1.239575495.5964626.1420974658", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c80d0385f326782e548c83e83205d9f1", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:20:00.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
