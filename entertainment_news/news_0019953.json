Comment   By Candace Krebs Posted Oct. 17, 2015 at 8:00 AM By Candace Krebs Contributing Writer Posted Oct. 17, 2015 at 8:00 AM Just in time for the lengthening evenings, best-selling author Sandra Dallas is releasing a new book that continues her tradition of bringing to life the unique people, places and history of Colorado. Dallas draws much of her inspiration from her own experiences as a longtime resident. She and her husband live in an elegantly restored Georgetown house that was used as the backdrop for one her books when an architect friend who was looking at it with them said the curved staircase in the front hall made it a “bride’s house.” “What a great title for a book, I thought to myself,” Dallas recalled recently during a book signing in Monument, hosted by Collected Treasures Bookstore. Dallas, who limits her public appearances mostly to Colorado venues, was in Monument to introduce her latest book, \"The Last Midwife.\" Future signings are planned Oct. 17 in Denver and Oct. 22 in Steamboat Springs. Dallas said when her New York agent initially urged her to write a story about a midwife, she was reluctant. “It’s been 50 years since I’ve given birth, and I’ve tried to forget the details,” she joked. “But in researching this book I learned a great deal. For these women, it was a calling.” Midwifery was a traditionally female occupation back in a time when most doctors were men. Now it’s becoming trendy again, as more people seek out personalized alternatives to the conventional hospital birth experience. Dallas chose to set the book on the Tenmile Range near Breckenridge during the 1880s. “The setting is always a character in my books,” she said. She took the plot from a poem written by Belle Turnbull, a colorful Breckenridge poet whom she had met while both lived in the ski resort community back in the 1960s. “When I moved there, the old people still lived there. They had their own dialect, their own way of talking. When they had to move because of the weather, they didn’t leave for Florida, they went to Buena Vista or Salida,” Dallas recalled. Dallas spent 25 years as a journalist, rising to the position of bureau chief for Business Week, before she turned to writing books. She originally thought she would focus on nonfiction covering “important” issues like land and water rights. But in 1990, she got her first idea for a novel and finished writing it in just three months. Over the years, Dallas has set her historical novels in Kansas as well as Colorado. Her father was originally from Harveyville, Kansas, near Topeka, but moved to Washington, D.C., to work for the government during the Great Depression. Dallas was born in Virginia, but soon after that the family moved to Colorado in hopes of providing a better climate for her mother, who was in poor health. Page 2 of 2 - Dallas has lived in Colorado ever since. Her degree in journalism is from the University of Denver. Now in her 70s, the author said her years as a journalist made her a disciplined, productive writer. She is already at work on her sixteenth novel, which will also be set in her home state. “For me, writing is like doing a laundry,” she said. “I have to psych myself up more to run the vacuum than I do to write.” By Candace Krebs   By Candace Krebs", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T03:25:11.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
