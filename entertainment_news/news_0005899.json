We know that many of the dealings in the industry work on relations and both Anushka and Allu Arjun are known to be best at maintaining good relations with almost everyone in the industry. \nOf late, it is our Gona Ganna Reddy and Rudramadevi that are jelling along quite well. Apparently, Anushka does anything for her friends in the industry and never hesitates to take any kind of challenges for the sake of friend ship. \nNo wonder she had appeared eight times on screen with her closest friend Nagarjuna till date. And now, Anushka is gearing up to sizzle in an item number for her new found bestie in the industry, Allu Arjun. \nGoing by the reports, the actress will be shaking a leg with the Stylish Star in a mass number in his next outing Sarainodu , directed by Boyapati. \nThough the duo appeared together in Vedam and Rudramadevi earlier, they never paired up for a film. Meanwhile, it is Anushka, who is being appreciated for taking up a item song, when she is on the other hand doing bigger projects like Baahubali. \nThere are also people who opine that this decision of the actress would keep her close to her fans, who miss her seeing in glamorous roles of late. Nevertheless, it is exciting for both Allu and Anushka fans to hear the news.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T08:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:53:55.202+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
