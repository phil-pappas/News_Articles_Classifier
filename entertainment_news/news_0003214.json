But German lawmakers rushed the new rules through parliament because a wave of hundreds of thousands of migrants did not seem to be letting up.\nEstimates of asylum requests expected vary between 800 000 and 1.5 million for Germany this year, up from just more than 200,000 in 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T03:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:34:17.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
