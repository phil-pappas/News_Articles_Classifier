He told the publication: \"We have talked about marriage, but 22 seems a bit young for us. Sophia needs to go off and do what she wants to do. I don't want her to be one of those stay-at-home girlfriends who doesn't really do much.'' \nPayne and Smith have been friends since they were in school and started dating two years back. The boy band member revealed that he had a crush on her for a long time and described their romance as \"one of those childhood sweetheart stories\". \n\"I didn't actually go out with her at the time [when we were younger]. I used to see her at school and we'd kind of chat. I asked her sister for her number,\" he said and added, \"She was very shy and didn't give much indication that she liked me, so I just assumed that she wasn't interested, as well as thinking, she was way too hot for me anyway.\" More about Liam Payne", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T10:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T11:29:53.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
