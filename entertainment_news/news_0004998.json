There are only two bands among the finalists, punk act Slaves and rockers Wolf Alice.Established in 1992 and open to acts from Britain and Ireland, the prize often favors the eclectic and obscure over better-known performers. \nSome winners, including Arctic Monkeys and Elbow, have gone on to mainstream fame, while others have failed to break through. \nThis year's winner of the 20,000 pounds ($32,000) prize will be announced Nov. 20.
