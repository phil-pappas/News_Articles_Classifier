The episode opened with two young female tourists checking into the Hotel Cortez only to be subjected to a creature in their bed, child vampires and being tortured by receptionist Iris (Kathy Bates). \nRunning alongside that was the story of junkie Hypodermic Sally (Sarah Paulson) who was murdered by Iris for causing her son Donovan (Matt Bomer) to overdose at the hotel. Sally’s ghost now haunts the Hotel Cortez as she watches and feeds off the addictions of the guests that check in, including Gabriel (Max Greenfield) who got raped by a monster with a drill-bit dildo as Sally watched on. \nMeanwhile Donovan has shacked up with the Countess (Lady Gaga) and the two lead a murderous vampire lifestyle. They also met with fashion mogul Will Drake (Cheyenne Jackson) who is interested in buying the hotel. \nAs if all that wasn’t enough we were also introduced to Det. John Lowe (Wes Bentley) who was on the trail of the Ten Commandments killer and checked himself into the Hotel Cortez after seeing his missing son in the corridors. \nThe next episode of the season is Chutes and Ladders. Fashion mogul Will Drake brings couture to the Hotel Cortez. A model catches The Countess’s eye. John learns about the hotel’s sadistic first owner. \nTune in to FOX HD at 10pm on Tuesday to see the episode.
