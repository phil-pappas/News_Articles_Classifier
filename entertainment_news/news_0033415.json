Courtesy Channel Nine The Verdict News Corp Australia 16 Oct 2015 News \nTHE ratings are in for the second episode of FNQ-raised Karl Stefanovic’s The Verdict, and they confirm what many were thinking when the new panel show was announced — Serious Karl is not for us. \nDespite plenty of hype, a rotating panel of some of Australia’s more controversial personalities, and of course, the popular host himself, Nine’s weekly program managed just 369,000 viewers on Thursday night, finishing in 24th spot. \nIt narrowly trumped Ten’s soap The Bold and the Beautiful , which snagged 360,000 viewers, but was beaten convincingly by shows such as Grant Denyer’s Family Feud on Ten, Hot Seat on Nine and The Chase Australia on Seven. It was a significant drop from last week, when 522,000 tuned in to check out the premiere. \nThe Today show host promised the new gig was going to be a “bumpy ride”, but evidently he had no idea just how bumpy it could be. Being given a five-episode run, it seems unlikely The Verdict will be prolonged beyond its upcoming final three weeks. \nThursday’s episode featured Love Child star Miranda Tapsell revealing that she doesn’t identify as Australian. Stefanovic also cornered former Labor leader Mark Latham about his resignation from the Australian Financial Review newspaper in August. Unfortunately, even hot-button topics such as these don’t seem to be able to garner enough viewer interest to keep them tuned in. \nIt’s a disappointing result for Stefanovic, who told news.com.au before the talk show premiered , that he was “looking forward” to the new challenges his role as ‘chair’ would bring. \nSo the verdict is in, Australia wants to see more of Karlos, TV’s resident larrikin making viewers crack up over their morning coffee, and less of Mr Stefanovic, tackling the big issues with certain controversial politicians. \nHere are some of our favourite Karl moments over the years. \nLOSING IT", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T10:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:55:08.899+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
