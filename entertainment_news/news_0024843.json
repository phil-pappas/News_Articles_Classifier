Speaking at the audio launch function of his much-awaited film Thoongavanam, Kamal said, “This film is a bilingual. It has been shot in Tamil and Telugu. Many people think that while shooting a bilingual, the same sequences will be used twice. But that is not the case. In Thoongavanam, several scenes had to be shot twice — once in Tamil and then in Telugu.” \nRumour mills are abuzz with different versions about the number of days it took to complete shooting this film. “We shot both versions of the film in a matter of 52 days. We needed another eight days to carry out corrections. So, technically, we took 60 days to make this film. Considering that we worked on two different films in that time period, for all practical reasons, you can say we took 30 days for a film,” he clarified. \nExplaining why he felt proud of this fact, he said, “There have been instances where I have worked on a film for 200 days. However, when there is planning, it can bring down the time required by a considerable margin. This was possible only because of the committed team who worked in the film. Every single person did his or her job perfectly.” \nA number of celebrities, including actors Dhanush, Vishal, Shruthi Haasan, Ponvannan, Karunas and director Gautham Vasudev Menon attended the event.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:10:06.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
