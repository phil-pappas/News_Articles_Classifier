And so it’s just passé at this juncture,” said Scott Flanders, the company’s chief executive. \nThe Times reported that playboy’s print circulation, once measured in millions, is now about 800,000, according to Alliance for Audited Media. \nThe move marks the latest step away from depictions of full nudity, which were banned from the magazine’s website last August. \nPrevious efforts to revamp Playboy have never quite stuck. But this time, as the magazine seeks to compete with younger outlets, Flanders said it sought to answer a key question: “if you take nudity out, what’s left?” Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T09:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:57:25.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
