(Dustin Rabin/HO and AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) Article Blue Jays let loose after clinching American League East \nIt’s no secret City and Colour ’s Dallas Green is a basketball nut. When Canadian hoops star Steve Nash signed with the Los Angeles Lakers over the Toronto Raptors several years back, he dropped this grenade on Twitter: “Steve, the Lakers? Really?! I can't f---ing believe it! I could have handled anyone but them.” And when the \"We the North\" movement took over Toronto in the spring of 2014, he was pleased. \nBut, right now, the emotive rocker is all about two things – the Toronto Blue Jays and what is shaping up to be a deep playoff run this month. \n— Dallas Green (@cityandcolour) September 30, 2015 \n\n“As a Toronto sports fan – whether it was basketball, hockey or baseball – for a long time, there just wasn’t anything to be excited about, and that’s changed,” he tells Postmedia Network. \n“At this time of the year for, I dunno, the last 10 years, normally I’m just getting ready for basketball. So to see the Blue Jays (going to the postseason), it’s just so exciting. The way that it happened, at the trade deadline, they were a .500 baseball team. I don’t think anyone envisioned this. The (Troy) Tulowitzki trade raised some eyebrows, people thought that was pretty cool. But what’s happened since – it’s insane. Things like that don’t happen … I feel very cool and happy to be alive in a moment when I get to watch something like this.” \nGreen has been readying the release of his fifth studio album, If I Should Go Before You, throughout the summer, but he’s been able to make it out to several games, including the final home game of the regular season. \n“Being at that game was pretty unbelievable. I’ve been lucky enough to go to a few games this season; I was there when Tulo made his debut and hit the home run, which I thought was unbelievable. We went the other night to see (Marcus) Stroman at home. \n“It’s kind of like watching the Raptors two years ago. Watching Toronto turn into a basketball city overnight. Basketball is my favourite sport and being a Canadian basketball fan has been very difficult. You’re the red-headed stepchild. But to watch the ACC explode and see the Jurassic Park thing, that was so exciting. And what’s happening right now with the Blue Jays is really exciting to watch.” \nCity and Colour's If I Should Go Before You will be released on Oct. 9.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T20:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T21:26:32.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
