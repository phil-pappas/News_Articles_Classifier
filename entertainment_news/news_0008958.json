Perth-raised (and formerly Melbourne-based) comedian-actor-writer Tim Minchin wrote the music and lyrics and Dennis Kelly wrote the book.\nMatilda the Musical is coming to Melbourne. Photo: James Morgan \nThe show has been almost universally revered wherever it has played.\nAdvertisement Sydney Morning Herald theatre critic John Shand gave the show four-and-a-half stars (out of five) when it opened in August.\n\"The miracle of Matilda the Musical is not that it offers burp jokes and mock horror to transfix the young and shrewder entertainment for adults, but that it turns grown-ups back into kids\" Shand wrote. \"The years roll back like some mist, and you feel that long-lost sense of wonder as well as being caught up in the mad contagion of fun.\"\nMatilda swept the Olivier Awards in 2012 after moving from the RSC's hometown, Stratford-upon-Avon, to London's West End, winning a record-equalling seven awards. On Broadway, it won four Tony awards in 2013, while the four girls who performed the title role on rotation also received an honorary awards for excellence in theatre.\nTim Minchin has been overwhelmed by the success of Matilda the Musical . Photo: Mark Kolbe \nThe show is still running in both London and New York, and in a touring production in the US. No end date for the Melbourne season has been announced, though it is slated to run for a \"strictly limited\" time. Tickets go on sale October 20.\nFollow Karl Quinn on twitter: @karlkwin \nOn Facebook: karl quinn writer", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T06:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:12:55.273+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
