The former \"Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" star collaborates with Colombian dance group, Bomba Estereo. He spits his verse in a remix of the band's Latin Grammy-nominated song \"Fiesta\". \"Hola mamacita/ Go get me a beer-a/ The track is the heat/ I couldn't let the beat go by without a feature,\" Smith raps. \"No gasoline, I'm a Tesla / Teach game, sensei, professor.\" He also name-drops actress Sofia Vergara and makes reference to his sitcom days. \"When I was told that Will Smith wanted to collaborate on a remix with Bomba, I couldn't believe it,\" said the group's founder Simon Mejia. \"This opportunity to work with Will was beyond anything we have dreamed of. It's not a traditional featuring - it's just magic. We all had a blast together at the video shoot, and we want to thank Will for being so warm and such a pleasure to work with ... and for rapping in Spanish!\" While no solo album is confirmed just yet, Will Smith has hinted at his music comeback. \"I went into the studio with Kanye. I'm thinking about it. I'm exploring,\" he said early this year when promoting his film \" Focus \". \"I'm not sure what I'm going to do yet, but I'm exploring. I'm in a creative ceiling. My son tells me I have to write out the things I don't like. I can't write and stop - I have to keep going and going and write them out. I've never worked like that before, but I think I might give that a shot.\" The actor will next be seen on the big screen in \" Concussion \" about the serious injuries suffered by football players. He will also be one of the anti-heroes in a Warner Bros. adaptation of DC Comics' \" Suicide Squad \". \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T18:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:28:08.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
