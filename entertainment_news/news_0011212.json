The tour will make additional stops in Denver, Rapid City, Sioux Falls and Oklahoma City as part of an ongoing public awareness and educational outreach campaign to help inform consumers that they can access dozens of local broadcast TV channels via an advanced digital antenna for free. Not only does the digital antenna deliver a high-quality picture, but it empowers consumers to access the most-watched, culturally-rich broadcast TV news and programming in America.\n“We have traveled to over 40 cities – large and small – across the country to spread the good news of free, over-the-air broadcast television. We love the looks on the faces of viewers when they realize all they need to get their favorite television is an antenna,” says Richard Schneider, president of Antennas Direct, an Inc. 5000 Hall of Fame company. “We can’t wait to empower more Americans with access to local news, lifeline weather coverage and the most popular entertainment programming on television.”\nThe demand for broadcast television has increased as more Americans become aware of the growth in niche programming formats via multicast “diginets,” according to Schneider, who noted Nielsen’s recent finding that more than 650,000 homes switched exclusively to over-the-air TV viewing in the last year. “Ethnic program formats and family-friendly networks have soared on broadcast TV,” said Schneider. “Couple that with the superior picture quality of broadcast over pay-TV and you understand why more people are flocking to over-the-air TV.”\n“Viewers’ preference for local broadcast TV is undeniable,\" said Robert C. Kenny, Director of Public Affairs, TVfreedom.org. \"Americans continue to rely heavily on local broadcast TV in just about every aspect of their daily lives. It’s always on, always providing entertainment and local news that make up the fabric of each community.”\nAt each tour stop, hundreds of patrons will receive the most advanced indoor/outdoor digital antennas, with the ability to pick up dozens of local broadcast TV signals as much as 50 miles away from their residence.
