Rita Ora at the X Factor auditions (Peter Byrne/PA) \nMark, who has enjoyed global success with his collaboration with Bruno Mars Uptown Funk, is up for the Best Male and Best Song prizes. \nThis year’s Mobo (Music Of Black Origin) Awards are dominated by London’s grime and hip hop acts, with duo Krept And Konan and JME receiving four nominations each. \nKrept And Konan, comprising Casyo “Krept” Johnson and Karl “Konan” Wilson, released their debut album The Long Way Home in July. \nKonan joked that the pair, who took home the Best Hip Hop Act trophy in 2014, need to “win everything”. \nHis bandmate Krept added: “It means a lot to be nominated because I grew up watching the Mobos on TV. To get four nominations and lead this year’s awards is crazy.” FKA Twigs (Dominic Lipinski/PA) Promoted stories \nGloucestershire singer Fka Twigs, who is dating actor Robert Pattinson, is up for three prizes. \nThe 27-year-old, whose real name is Tahliah Barnett, faces Glynne, Ella Eyre, Lianne La Havas and newcomer Little Simz for the Best Female accolade. Sam Smith won at the 2014 Mobo Awards (Dominic Lipinski/PA) \nSam Smith won Best Male with Jessie J as Best Female in the 2014 ceremony. \nElla, who aims to follow in Jessie’s footsteps, said: “It’s quite surreal to be nominated again this year for Best Female Act, when I was nominated last year. The category is just so strong, and I’m glad to be a part of that.” \nShe added: “The first time I went to the Mobo Awards was when I was playing with Rudimental and no-one knew who I was, so to be nominated for a second time around three years later is amazing. I’m flattered.” Wiley (Peter Byrne/PA) \nRap star Wiley will be honoured with the inaugural Paving The Way award. \nA paving stone will be laid at his former secondary school in Bow, east London, which his father also attended. \nThe nominations were announced by former Xtra Factor host Sarah-Jane Crawford at Ronnie Scott’s jazz club in London. Congratulations to all of the nominees it was lovely to see you at @officialronnies this AM 👯😁🙌🏾 #moboawards pic.twitter.com/onTkmhg0AL \n— Sarah-Jane Crawford (@DJSarahJane) September 30, 2015 \nSarah-Jane, who will return to host the ceremony, said: “This is one of the strongest nominees lists I’ve seen. That is testament to the artists themselves because you can’t put a strong nominees list together if the music’s not there, and this year the music has been there.” \nShe continued: “Grime has enjoyed a resurgence. Stormzy is so exciting because he’s just stormed the top 20 without any promotion and Krept And Konan are going over to America, and people are taking them seriously over there. So that Best Male category alone is a sign of the times and shows how strong it is this year.” Share article \nThe 2015 Mobo Awards, now in its 20th year, will take place at the First Direct Arena in Leeds on November 4 and will be broadcast live on ITV2.
