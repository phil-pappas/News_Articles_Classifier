Edith Bowman (Hotel Indigo) \n“I think with regards to (reality singing) shows, they’re coming to, not the end, but there’s only so many times you can do it. I think maybe it’s a backlash from the viewers because there’s nothing new to it really, even if you bring in new judges and great new judges like Grimmy who injects a real element of fun and silliness to it. \n“From the one episode I saw, I think he’s the best thing about it,” the Radio Scotland DJ said. \nEdith admitted that while she loved watching the show, she “generally wouldn’t be bothered about having to see or hear from any of the contestants ever again after the show had finished”. Nick Grimshaw has caused controversy by bringing back contestant Mason Noise (Thames/Syco/Fremantle) \nShe had some scathing words too for popular artists who lip-sync instead of singing live. Promoted stories \nWhen Cheryl Fernandez-Versini’s performance on last year’s show – where she was accused of miming her track I Don’t Care – was mentioned, Edith replied, “That infuriates me. I remember seeing Pink at the Isle of Wight festival and she bungee-jumped off a crane then she was zip-wiring across the crowd and was singing live. You work it, you sing live.” \nEdith, who has curated a playlist of her Sounds Of The Neighbourhood for Hotel Indigo, was willing to put her money where her mouth was by saying she would sing on a charity version of The Voice. \n“I would love if they did The Voice for Comic Relief, where they had 10 celebrities and got them to sing and be judged.” Edith would love a celeb version of The Voice for Comic Relief (John Giles/PA) \nDespite hosting her own TV talent search Guitar Star for Sky Arts this summer, the mother of two, who is married to Editors frontman Tom Smith, said she would never be tempted to follow in Grimmy’s footsteps. ”I wouldn’t want to do one of those shows like The Voice,” she said. \nHer own show, she said, “didn’t put anyone up there that didn’t have the ability. At no point was it about making them feel uncomfortable or doing something they didn’t want to do or ridiculing them. I came away from it feeling really good about that.” \nEdith has written a guide to UK festivals and said she would like to see Coldplay or Adele headlining the coveted Pyramid stage at next year’s Glastonbury. Edith would like to see Adele on stage at Glastonbury (Yui Mok/PA) \nAlthough she said she loved the Foo Fighters, she would “like to see a heritage band there like Fleetwood Mac at the Isle of Wight last year” rather than the Dave Grohl-fronted band return. \nLast year, Florence + The Machine replaced the band at the final hour after Grohl broke his leg and she became the only female main stage headliner. \nEdith, however, did not see the lack of female representation on the main stage as a huge issue. Florence Welch on the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury this year (Yui Mok/PA) \n“People forget to look past that main stage mentality, to look at the females who are on that bill, to look at the risks that have been taken, the opportunities that have been given to someone to headline,” she explained. \nBowman also denounced the critics of Sam Smith’s Bond song, Writing’s On The Wall. \n“I feel really sad for Sam because he was bookies’ favourite to do the song and then no-one gives it a chance. I like it. I think generally at the minute there’s a tone in our media which is incredibly half glass empty and not glass half full and it really infuriates me. Sam Smith on the cover for the new Bond theme (Sony Pictures Entertainment) \n“Its a very different Bond song to what we’ve had in the past, it’s not that kind of sweep of anthemic-ness. I think it’ll make a lot of sense to those people who don’t like it yet when they see the film,” she said.
