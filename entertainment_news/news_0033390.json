Bill Bradley Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Posted: 10/20/2015 11:06 AM EDT \nAh, children. Whitney Houston believed they are our future, but don't forget they're also the reason you learn all the terrible things your name rhymes with in school. \nJimmy Kimmel harnessed both the adorable and blunt sides of kids in his latest edition of \" LA vs. New York .\" Kimmel's camera crew asked kids from each city what they thought of people from the other city, and the results are predictably hilarious. \nAccording to the kids, LA residents are really into plastic surgery and think there's too much gluten in the world, while New Yorkers are \"crazy\" and Donald Trump lives there. \nIt's all totally offensive in the most adorable way ever. One kid even names Kim Kardashian as the dumbest person in LA, but the way he says it would probably even make Kim say, \"Awww.\" \n\"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" airs weeknights at 11:35 p.m. ET on ABC. \nAlso on HuffPost:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T18:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:47:33.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
