Written and directed by Ding Sheng. 106 minutes. Not rated; for mature audiences (contains violence, language). In Mandarin, with English subtitles. Pacific Place.\nFilmed mostly at night by writer-director Ding Sheng, it’s replete with all the expected cop-movie sights and sounds: speeding cars, lights and sirens, gunshots and grim-faced lawmen staring into surveillance screens, sifting for clues that will lead them to the kidnappers.\n  Nothing new here, in other words, but the director deploys all the familiar tropes with an assured forcefulness that makes the movie crackle with a rough energy.\nWhat is out of the ordinary is the depth of characterizations of the two main figures. Wu, who spends most of the picture chained to a chair in the gang’s dingy hideout, is brave to the point of near-fearlessness. \nHe verbally spars with his captor, seeking to determine if the guy has a vestige of a better nature and trying to appeal to that. “I can’t respect you if you play dirty,” he says, attempting to somehow shame his abductor into more humane behavior. \nHis captor, Zhang, is intrigued by Wu’s attempts to locate a sliver of humanity in him, but he has no conscience and is enraptured with his own cleverness and evil nature.\nThe back-and-forth between the two gives “Mr. Wu” an un­expected dramatic heft.\nSoren Andersen: asoren7575@yahoo.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:39:08.874+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
