Mr McCullum didn’t log an official report on Cairns at the time. He should have done that. He will tell you he regrets not doing that, but will explain that Chris Cairns was such a hero to him that he could not bring himself to do that straight away.” \nIt was not until McCullum and the New Zealand team underwent anti-corruption training at the World Cup in India in 2011 that he alerted officials to what happened, Wass said, but in the three years between he did tell other people.Cairns is charged with perjury and perverting the course of justice, while Fitch-Holland is accused of perverting the course of justice. They both deny the charges. \nModified Date: October 8, 2015 10:28 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:06:33.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
