While the occasion is being observed at record stores around the world, in Las Vegas it's being celebrated at both locations of Zia Record Exchange, at 4503 W. Sahara Ave. and 4225 S. Eastern Ave.\nLike Record Store Day, its much higher-profile counterpart — for obvious reasons: cassette tapes, while experiencing a resurgence in the past few years thanks to some determined independent labels, are a more boutique item in terms of format — which takes place semiannually and attracts throngs of analog aficionados to independent retailers for exclusive releases, Cassette Store Day is set to feature a spate of releases that have been previously unavailable otherwise.\nAccording to the folks at Zia, among the titles being offered this year, they've stocked the stores with \"Down III,\" which compiles a trio of releases from the New Orleans-based supergroup and marks the first time these titles have been issued in this format. You'll also find \"Drones,\" the most recent release from Muse, \"What Went Down\" by Foals, \"Ultraviolet\" by Kylesa, \"Bad Magic\" from Motorhead, along with a couple of odd soundtrack reissues, one from a film called \"Slime City,\" from 1988, and the other for \"Shogun Assassin\" from 1980.\n— Read more from Dave Herrera at reviewjournal.com.
