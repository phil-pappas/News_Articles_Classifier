Although he was robbed as the winner of the eighth season of “American Idol,” Adam Lambert — the flesh-and-blood equivalent to Jet Screamer (the flamboyant pop star on “The Jetsons” best known for the hit, “Eep Opp Ork Ah-Ah”) — turned out to be the big winner. After “American Idol” wrapped, Lambert released his debut “For Your Entertainment,” which sold nearly two million copies worldwide and featured the Grammy-nominated radio smash, “Whataya Want From Me.\" His sophomore follow-up “Trespassing” topped the charts. In addition, Lambert's solo tour and tour fronting Queen (with founding members Brian May and Roger Taylor) sold out venues throughout the world. For XLO’s \"Almost\" Acoustic Xmas, Lambert will be performing with a full band. More guests will be announced. Sponsored by WXLO 104.5 FM, the XLO’s Acoustic Xmas has become a holiday tradition for Central Mass., bringing some of today’s biggest pop stars to downtown Worcester, including Train, The Fray, Daughtry, Gavin Degraw and Andy Grammer, just to name a few. Tickets are $55-$65, plus applicable service charges. Tickets for the general public go on sale Oct. 9 at www.mechanicshall.org , the Mechanics Hall box office (opened 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday) or by phone at (508) 752-0888. Internet presale begins at 10 a.m. Oct. 7 for XLO eclub members.
