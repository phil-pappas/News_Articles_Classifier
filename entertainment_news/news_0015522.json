CNBC reports that CEO Jack Dorsey aims to cut at least eight per cent of Twitter’s personnel, with figures of around 336 employees reported in other news outlets are advised to have been let go from the organisation.\nDorsey expressed his regret at having to remove the portion of the workforce from the company’s equation in an open letter to employees this week, supposedly ahead of restructuring of the social media giant’s processes in the interest of increasing efficiency. Many, however, may be quick to assume that the layoffs could be related to the platform’s continued net losses, which saw a total loss of $162 million experienced by the firm from January through March of 2015 alone. One News Page recently reported on the continued phenomenon of Twitter – but the news of employee layoffs perhaps lays claim to the fact that the company are aiming to usher in big changes to make the platform even more efficient and accessible to users going forward towards 2020.\nSocial media became a phenomenon at the end of the last decade and it’s only in recent years that services such as Facebook and Twitter have started to feel the pinch, with the latter losing revenue as mentioned and the former, surprisingly, losing grace with its core audience in young people as reported midway through 2015. Could it be that the bubble has finally burst? With relative newcomers WhatsApp and Snapchat also reporting loss and employee cuts respectively, this is an interesting trend in social media which could well continue towards the end of the decade.\nMany have found Twitter’s news interesting, though it is clear that the giant has plenty of life left in it after the revelation of the ‘Moments’ feature at the start of October. How will the layoffs impact the future of the site, and what changes can the platform’s colossal userbase expect to see in the coming months and years? If fortunes are to turn around, changes must be made – and it certainly appears that Dorsey and co are set to attempt to make them.", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsserve.net/i/20151014/1825-Twitter-trimming-down.jpg", "http://cdn.newsserve.net/email_small.png"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:30:26.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
