She wasn’t recommending or advocating any particular direction I go, but she encouraged exploring, finding out what I want to do,” Glendening said.\nBergh believes Glendening caused her to again believe in love and change her mind about remaining single after her divorce six years prior.\n“I had totally embraced I was single and that I never needed a guy,” Bergh said. “Then I met Henry.”\nExactly two years after the arrant text message, Glendening proposed to Bergh at a rooftop restaurant where they ended their first meeting, with her favourite song, Thank You by Led Zeppelin, playing in the background.\nThe couple married June 27 in front of a graffiti wall near the St. Louis riverfront.\nThis article originally appeared on The New York Post and has been republished with permission.\n Couple fell in love via accidental text", "external_links": ["http://nypost.com/2015/10/01/this-couple-fell-in-love-because-of-an-accidental-text/", "http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/an-errant-text-begins-an-unconventional-love-story-for-st/article_90638441-6025-5a4c-ab52-d48ccf323f55.html", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/relationships/this-st-louis-couple-met-via-an-accidental-text-message/story-fnet09y4-1227553628957"], "published": "2015-10-02T18:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:16:38.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
