But in 1930s London, he is not the only monster around. (ITV) \nAn Ofcom spokesman said: “Ofcom has received 212 [complaints] about Jekyll and Hyde, which aired on ITV on Sunday. We will assess these complaints before deciding whether to investigate or not.” \nThe first episode featured a half-human half-dog creature called a Harbinger, the physical transformation of saintly Jekyll into evil Hyde, and the brutal murder of Robert’s foster parents in Ceylon. It also showed a violent bar fight and a punch-up in an alleyway. \nMany Twitter users were shocked. @ITV why are you showing Jekyll and Hyde pre watershed? Too violent and scary when young children still up. Are you mad or just chancers?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T14:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T17:59:43.200+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
