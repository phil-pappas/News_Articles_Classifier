With that as inspiration, we decided to design TV shows for other entertainers based on their earlier jobs. (We’re not counting those who tended bar or waited on tables, since restaurant work is probably more common than acting school on celebrity resumés.)\nImagine these TV pilots (as in first episodes of a series, not actors who have previously flown airliners):\nHome Improvement\nHarrison Ford was a carpenter before 'Star Wars' launched him on an A-list acting career. (Photo: Jesse Grant, Getty Images for Disney)\nMove over, Tim Allen. Harrison Ford really was a carpenter. In this sitcom, he plays the skilled host of a do-it-yourself show who can build a mean replica of the Ark of the Covenant. Of course, we’re not sure the future Han Solo would have abandoned wood shop for Tool Time . So, how about roles in Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Nails and Star Wars: A New Lathe ? Of course, there's always the potential for a biopic about a certain Nazarean carpenter.\nLaw & Order: Special Victors' Unit\nHill Harper, a star of CBS' 'Limitless' and 'CSI: New York,' attended Harvard Law School with a future president, Barack Obama. (Photo: David M. Russell, CBS)\nHill Harper ( Limitless , CSI: New York ), who went to Harvard Law School with future president Barack Obama, plays a law professor presiding over a class of students considering glamorous future careers in such fields as acting, running for high office and estate planning. Yeah, it’s not going to be estate planning. Alternate plan: CBS launches CSI: HLS , featuring a crack team of forensics investigators using state-of-the-art techniques to find trace evidence of humility on an Ivy League campus.\nTo Sting, With Love\nSting was a teacher before he became music superstar. (Photo: Manuel De Almeida, EPA)\nIn this single-camera comedy, the renowned singer and songwriter, a former English teacher, is the coolest faculty member in a tough, urban school. Episodes are known to last up to seven hours but viewers say the conclusion is very satisfying. This could be a drama, too, with an alternate title: I’ll Be Watching You .\nNeuroBlossom\nMayim Bialik has a Ph.D. in neuroscience and a successful acting career. (Photo: Lily Lawrence, Getty Images)\nFirst, Mayim Bialik was TV's Blossom. Then, she got a Ph.D. in neuroscience. In this show, Bialik portrays Blossom as a neuroscientist focused on mathematical proofs and the number Six. Oops! Copyright overlap: On The Big Bang Theory , Bialik portrays a neuroscientist focused on a physics geek and a lack of sex.\nHalt and Fix Franchise\nMasi Oka might make his time-and-space-bending 'Heroes' character jealous, playing characters on 'Heroes Reborn' and 'Hawaii Five-0' at the same time. (Photo: Norman Shapiro, CBS)\nMasi Oka ( Heroes Reborn , Hawaii Five-0 ), who worked on the Star Wars prequels as an Industrial Light & Magic digital artist before he became time-and-space-bending Hiro on Heroes , plays a special-effects expert who travels back in time in a desperate race to prevent Jar Jar Binks from ever being CGI-ed!\nCoffee, Tea or Meh\nEvangeline LIlly was a flight attendant before moving on to a successful acting career. (Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY)\nFormer flight attendant Evangeline Lilly ( Ant-Man , Lost ) plays a skilled but annoying flight attendant who drives passengers to their barf bags with incessant whining about how her favorite fantasy TV series stole six years of her life with its they-were-all-dead ending.\nSean Connery delivered dairy products before he became film icon James Bond. (Photo: John G. Mabanglo, EPA)\nMilk Men\nBefore Sean Connery was James Bond, he was a milk man. Isn't that the weirdest thing? Not Connery so much, but that men used to make a living delivering milk to people's homes. In this period drama, Connery plays a womanizing, perishable-items genius trying to navigate the rapidly changing social mores – and delivery routes – of 1960s New York. If Bond as milk man is too irresistible, there's From Dairy With Lov e, which features the undercover spy explaining delivery items in 007-ese: \"Cream. Sour cream. Eggs. Brown eggs. Milk. Whole Milk.\" Nobody delivers it better.\nReal Nannies of Hollywood\nKatie Lowes, who plays Quinn on 'Scandal,' worked as a nanny while trying to break into acting. (Photo: Michael Desmond, ABC)\nKatie Lowes, who worked as Nashville star Connie Britton's nanny before winning the role of Quinn on Scandal , plays a Hollywood nanny who aspires to acting fame in this All About Eve- meets -UnReal take on reality TV. The twist: Unlike many reality TV stars, this character has talent.\nOne art-imitating-life project is currently in production – and drawing high ratings:\nThe Political Celebrity Apprentice\nBillionaire Donald Trump has gone from 'Apprentice' host to presidential candidate. (Photo: Erik S. Lesser, EPA)\nBillionaire and Celebrity Apprentice star Donald Trump seeks to make The Apprentice great again, playing a political novice drawing big crowds and bigger TV ratings as he runs for president. Many critics have wrongly predicted early cancellation and can't agree on whether this is a comedy, a drama, a tragedy, an inspirational tale or a fantasy. The Trump show relies more on improvisation than some of its seemingly scripted competitors.\n4 CONNECT 11 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1Lr5BYO TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/418a9e00d249e6afba92afdb183bc49c4188874b/c=0-575-2441-2410&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/635801853744154271-Sting.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1Lr5BYO", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/12fbd334b276cd82fdbdc93c4a2a3b729e260f1b/c=93-0-2795-3603&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/10/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/635801917226265205-Sean-Connery.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/635801838695361805-140587-1523.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/009fa08dee108562e7bd251d0513fb0c87c54024/c=277-0-2940-2002&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/635801935775876112-140672-4323.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1666d751c9fdd9385e526a3ad5a16a06c5b0deeb/c=117-0-1883-1328&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/635801860779487369-Masi-Oka-Hawaii-Five-0.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Lr5BYO&text=Physician%2C%20play%20thyself%3A%20TV%20roles%20imagined%20from%20early%20jobs&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/27f6664fb8ef48299f06ee96e2d6771613497b2a/c=170-0-2830-2000&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/635801838695361805-140587-1523.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Lr5BYO&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4273601a450deb8c659e034ad1cb16508ac678f9/c=0-50-2062-1600&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/635801856667613011-Mayim-Bialik.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cb8836b77e787c4d41459b3c8bf0ce08f1ec18d9/c=283-0-4645-3280&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/635801901316971223-Evangeline-Lilly.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/415d5c5927ef4922e96040fcb2c0304b9cedfa23/c=0-52-1328-1051&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/635801850557053841-Hill-Harper-Limitless.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0a878400501bdc53d9ef9682249998fed07c7e04/c=0-41-1880-1455&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/635801846815369856-Harrison-Ford.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/635801838695361805-140587-1523.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/642f0a8501a092eb92e9050d8453f994bcb46289/c=333-0-3174-2136&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/635801863922751518-Donald-Trump.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-13T00:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:03:42.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
