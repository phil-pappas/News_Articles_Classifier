Foxtel vowed to stay true to the original series' recipe for success. \nFollowing the British series, which is hosted by two female comedians, GABO (as it's affectionately called by the crew) is helmed by Aussie funny women Claire Hooper and Mel Buttle. \nTheir cheeky, dry sense of humour helps to lighten the mood but Claire and Mel are also a supportive force in the kitchen. \nThey have not previously worked together, but the two women have great chemistry and their off-the-cuff remarks really spice up the goings-on of the kitchen (set in a 'shed' styled to within an inch of its life). \nThe show also has great cooking credentials thanks to its superstar judges Matt Moran and Maggie Beer. \nThe other thing I like about the show is that the contestants aren't competing for a cash prize or a TV or cookbook deal. They're simply baking for the love of it and the title of Australia's best amateur baker. \nThese are real, everyday people who aren't after a career in the media (cough, MKR, cough). \nThey include a GP, an 18-year-old student, mums and a macaroon-obsessed miner. The gender balance is also great, with five men and seven women. \nThey also don't have to work under unrealistic time constraints - one of my other bugbears with other reality cooking shows. \nThe only thing that would improve Bake Off, is if we could have \"smello-vision\" through our smart TVs so we could enjoy the aromas of treats baking. Sure rich chocolate cakes look sexy on screen, but imagine if you could smell them. \nBake Off is light, sweet viewing. Who doesn't enjoy that? editors picks", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T00:47:46.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
