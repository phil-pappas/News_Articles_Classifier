Wilmott"], "text": "(1) The guidance figure in the table above presents the guidance Penn National Gaming provided on July 23, 2015 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, as adjusted to reflect the change in classification of the Master Lease from an operating lease to a financing obligation. (2) Acquisition related transaction costs of $0.7 million were recorded in corporate overhead for the three months ending September 30, 2015. Reflecting the change in classification of the Master Lease from an operating lease to a financing obligation, the Company will restate its financial statements filed since the spin-off (the “Spin-off”) of its real estate assets to GLPI on November 1, 2013 (the “Restatement”). The Restatement (as more fully described in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 22, 2015) is being made solely to change the classification of the Master Lease from an operating lease to a financing obligation in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). During the preparation and negotiation of the Master Lease, the Company reviewed its accounting conclusions for the Master Lease with Ernst & Young, LLP (“EY”), its independent registered public accounting firm. The Company and its professional advisors believed that it was appropriate to account for the Master Lease as an operating lease under GAAP. Subsequent to the Spin-Off, the Company received unqualified audit opinions on its financial statements at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, from EY. Upon EY’s recent reconsideration of that accounting treatment, the Company re-examined this accounting and the relevant accounting literature. Following this review, the Company and the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Audit Committee”) determined on October 20, 2015 that the accounting with respect to the Master Lease should be revised in order to treat such lease as a financing obligation. Notably, the adjustments in the Restatement will have no impact on the following indicators of the Company’s performance: the Company’s cash position; the Company’s cash flows; the Company’s leverage ratios under its senior credit facility and other debt instruments (as the terms of those obligations require the Master Lease to be treated as an operating lease regardless of the treatment required under GAAP); the Company’s revenues; or the Company’s rental payments or other obligations under the Master Lease. Timothy J. Wilmott, President and Chief Executive Officer of Penn National Gaming, commented, “The Restatement involves a revised view, initiated by our external auditors, of the technical requirements for operating lease accounting treatment. This change has no impact on key indicators of the Company’s performance and the third quarter was very active and productive for Penn National as we again generated financial results that exceeded guidance while further advancing and expanding our development and growth pipeline. Our quarterly results reflect year-over-year improvements in regional gaming trends and the continued success of our operating teams in driving improved adjusted EBITDA margins. “Compared to the prior year period, third quarter operating results also benefited from the first full quarterly contribution from Plainridge Park Casino and our two Ohio racing and video lottery terminal facilities that opened in last year’s third quarter. All three of these properties are performing well and each is currently achieving adjusted EBITDA returns of approximately 20% on invested capital. We also further expanded our growth pipeline during the quarter with two exciting opportunities as we closed on the Tropicana Las Vegas and Prairie State Gaming (“PSG”) transactions and we’ve realized a partial quarter of contributions from both operations, net of transaction costs. “The reported third quarter operating results reflect year-over-year improvements in both customer visits and spend per visit at the majority of our properties on a same-facility basis. Overall, third quarter adjusted EBITDA exceeded guidance by $12.4 million, inclusive of a $2.7 million positive operating segment variance but excluding net adjusted EBITDA contributions from Tropicana Las Vegas and PSG; a $6.9 million benefit related to cash-settled stock based awards; and, approximately $2.5 million of various non-recurring property-level positive variances for items such as gaming tax and other refunds. “During the third quarter we generated adjusted EBITDA margin improvements in our East/Midwest and Southern Plains operating segments, while the margin decline in our West segment was due to the inclusion of the recently acquired Tropicana Las Vegas operations. Overall, Penn National’s ongoing execution of strategies to improve operating efficiencies drove consolidated third quarter 2015 adjusted EBITDA margin growth of approximately 205 basis points on a year-over-year basis to 28.4%, inclusive of the slight impact related to our operation of Tropicana Las Vegas for approximately five weeks during the quarter as well as Prairie State Gaming which was acquired on September 1, 2015. “In Massachusetts, revenue trends at Plainridge Park Casino are largely consistent with other recent property openings, where revenue numbers taper down over the first few months, before typically ramping back up to a more normalized run rate as our marketing programs take effect. Throughout the third quarter, Plainridge Park’s player loyalty card sign-up, spend per visit and revenue figures were solid, and we remain confident the property will extend Penn National’s track record of generating high returns from prudent capital deployment. Over the coming months we are implementing several initiatives to fine tune the gaming floor product mix and overall marketing strategy to build upon the property’s initial success and customer database which is now approaching 130,000 unique players. “Our completion of the $360 million acquisition of Tropicana Las Vegas in late August represents an exciting and important milestone for Penn National as it fulfills a long-term strategic objective to acquire a quality Las Vegas Strip property with excellent growth prospects at the right location and the right price. The addition of Tropicana Las Vegas brings significant economic potential as we can fully leverage our database of nearly three million active regional gaming customers, a significant percentage of which regularly visit Las Vegas. Having owned the property for almost two months, we’ve already begun to implement numerous initial operational improvements and remain confident in our two-phase plan to successfully build upon the approximately $200 million in capital investment in Tropicana Las Vegas completed by the former owners over the last several years. “The first of those two phases has commenced and includes investments at Tropicana Las Vegas to improve the customer experience by refreshing and enhancing the gaming floor through updates of slot product and systems and by offering a wider array of table games; improving the breadth and quality of the property’s food and beverage offerings; and, integrating Penn National’s Marquee Rewards player loyalty program with the property’s systems. In addition to these initiatives, we have identified opportunities to improve ADR and margins at the property and realize the high value of the nearly 1,500 recently renovated guest rooms based on our ability to attract stronger gaming customers from our database. Longer-term, we will evaluate other potential facility enhancements at the Tropicana with the scope, budget and timing of any such expansion and improvements to be based upon our operation of the property and customer demand for additional amenities. “As noted above, during the third quarter, Penn National also acquired a leading Illinois video gaming terminal (“VGT”) operator, PSG. As one of the largest and most respected VGT route operators in Illinois, PSG’s operations include more than 1,100 terminals across a network of 270 bar and retail gaming establishments throughout the State. We believe PSG offers Penn National a solid platform for future adjusted EBITDA growth in the Illinois VGT market and potentially in other states where this form of gaming may be authorized in the future. “Reflecting our research and analysis that social and online gaming represent emerging growth platforms that complement our growing regional gaming portfolio, we believe our entrée into these markets, which was further advanced during the third quarter, will result in incremental adjusted EBITDA, enhanced customer data analytics and improved marketing efficiency. We estimate that approximately 40% of our database members participate in social/online gaming today and our growing digital resources and capabilities will position Penn National to participate in social and regulated real-money online opportunities as they develop. We are very pleased with the early results from our Play 4 Fun launch in partnership with Scientific Games in the third quarter at our Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races and Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course properties and are excited about the future as we invest in this new business segment. “Our $390 million Hollywood Casino Jamul-San Diego development remains on schedule for a mid-2016 opening. We remain confident its location and proximity to San Diego relative to competitive alternatives -- combined with its state-of-the-art design -- position Hollywood Casino Jamul-San Diego to allow the Jamul Indian Village to become economically self-sufficient and ultimately generate high quality education, healthcare, and sufficient housing for tribal members. The three-story gaming and entertainment facility will include more than 1,700 slot machines, 43 live table games, our signature Final Cut Steak & Seafood steakhouse, a noodle bar, an upscale sports bar, a posh lounge featuring national and regional entertainment, a beer garden, a four-venue food court, and an eight-story partially subterranean parking garage with over 1,800 parking spaces. “We believe Penn National remains favorably positioned for continued adjusted EBITDA growth and enhanced shareholder value in 2016 and beyond. The Company stands to benefit from the disciplined management of our existing properties coupled with growing evidence of an improved operating environment, a full year of operations of Plainridge Park, strengthened operations at Tropicana Las Vegas, the addition of PSG and the opportunity to strategically expand our presence in the VGT market, new online/social gaming opportunities, continued growth and efficiencies at our other recently opened or acquired properties, and a meaningful contribution in 2016 from Hollywood Casino Jamul-San Diego.” Development and Expansion Projects The table below summarizes Penn National Gaming’s ongoing and recently completed development projects: Project/Scope", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:57:31.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
