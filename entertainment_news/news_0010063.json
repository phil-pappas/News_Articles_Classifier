Another high-speed challenging competition gets underway in Las Vegas in one week for the 22nd consecutive year: \nThe world’s top bull riders and fiercest bucking bulls in the business return for the richest bull-riding event on the planet, the 2015 Professional Bull Riders Built Ford Tough World Finals from Oct. 21-25 at UNLV’s Thomas & Mack Center, that offers a total purse of $2.3 million. \nNext year, the cowboys move to the new Las Vegas Arena behind New York-New York and Monte Carlo. \nQualifying for this season finale is considered an incredible feat and fulfills a lifelong dream for many bull-riding athletes. This year, 40 bull-riding stars made the cut, including some familiar Las Vegas names: \nJ.B. Mauney and Shane Proctor both from Mooresville, N.C.; 2014 PBR world champion Silvano Alves, Guilherme Marchi, Valdiron de Oliveira, Renato Nunes, Joao Vieira and Fabiano Vieira all from Brazil; Cody Nance from Paris, Tenn.; and Mike Lee of Decatur, Texas. \nOn the other side of the 8-second battles are the best bulls of the 2015 Built Ford Tough Series season. Their 2015 slates are wiped clean, and the only scores that matter are those received at the World Finals. The bull that receives the highest aggregate score in two rounds of competition will be declared the 2015 PBR world champion bull, and the owner receives $50,000. \nProtecting the riders from the stomping, angry, furious bulls will be Shorty Gorham, Frank Newsom, Jesse Byrne and Cody Webster, who were voted by the Top 35 riders to watch their backs. \nThe Top 35 bull riders also voted for the five-man judging panel to score each ride, break ties and review replays: Allan Jordan, Lane Foltyn, Royd Doyal and Shawn Ramirez will assess each ride, with Jeff Shearer serving as replay judge. \nThe 2015 PBR World Finals also offers a $1 million bonus to the world champion, who also receives the coveted world champion belt buckle. Each rider will ride one bull per night during Rounds 1-5 from next Wednesday through Sunday. \nScores from the five rides will then be combined, and the Top 15 riders will advance to the Built Ford Tough Championship Round after the completion of Round 5 on Sunday, Oct. 25. \nThe rider with the highest total score for the six rounds will earn the PBR Built Ford Tough World Finals event title and $250,000 for first place. \nThe current points leader is 2013 PBR world champion J.B. Mauney with six 90-plus-point rides this season and four wins in Des Moines; Biloxi, Miss.; Tulsa, Okla., and Tucson. He has ranked first in the world standings for the last eight weeks and is currently sporting a 58 percent riding percentage, leading all riders. \nJ.B. sits in the top spot with 5,105 points, 1,315 ahead of No. 2 Joao Vieira, 2013 Rookie of the Year, who won Last Cowboy Standing here. \nThe events begin daily at 6 p.m. PT Wednesday through Saturday and 1 p.m. Sunday. CBS Sports Network will broadcast every round Wednesday through Saturday, then again Sunday. \nRobin Leach of “Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous” fame has been a journalist for more than 50 years and has spent the past 15 years giving readers the inside scoop on Las Vegas, the world’s premier platinum playground. \nFollow Robin Leach on Twitter at Twitter.com/Robin_Leach . \nFollow Las Vegas Sun Entertainment + Luxury Senior Editor Don Chareunsy on Twitter at Twitter.com/VDLXEditorDon .
