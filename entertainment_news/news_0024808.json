Donald Weber/Getty Images Share Share on Facebook \nWoe to the casual film-goer who might not be familiar with the work of Belgian filmmaker Chantal Akerman who died this week. \nHer often experimental films are just the kind of fare that NY Times film critic A.O. Scott celebrated in a recent essay, \" Film Snob? Is That So Wrong? \" \nAkerman was lauded for revolutionizing cinema by creating films \"often experimental and without concessions.\" Her landmark work, 1975's three-hour-plus \"Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles,\" depicted in real time the drab routines of a Belgian housewife forced into prostitution to make money. There are no fast edits, no Sorkin-like dialogue, no meet-cutes. \nFor all those reasons, Scott loves it. He writes \"I like my pleasures slow and difficult. I would rather watch a mediocre film from South America or Eastern Europe about the sufferings of poor people than a mediocre Hollywood comedy about the inconveniences of the affluent.\" \nWhen it comes to movie culture, proclivities of extremes seem to mirror politics of the day. The Scotts of the world would veto popcorn-fare entirely, and the populists cannot abide subtitles, black & white, nor documentary. Where do you fall?
