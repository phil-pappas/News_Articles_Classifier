The vid features the band cruising around Los Angeles to make unexpected musical appearances at various weddings. \nThe wedding-crashing scenario will figure into the pilot, as will a bachelorette party that gets a surprise guest from a prominent actor. \nThe untitled project hails from Levine's 222 Productions and Renegade 83. Levine and producing partner Jordan Feldstein are exec producers along with Dobkin, 222's Josh Gummersall and Renegade's David Garfinkle and Jay Renfroe. \nLevine, a regular on NBC's \"The Voice,\" has been revving up his activity as a producer in recent years. He had been developing an event series for the Peacock set in the 197os-era music business but NBC opted to table the project. \nLevine and Renegade are with CAA and Jackoway Tyerman. Dobkins' with WME. \nVariety", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:08:18.334+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
