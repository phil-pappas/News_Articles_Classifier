I’ve grown to enjoy the laidback Mackay lifestyle and all it has to offer. Over the years I have also spent time visiting the Whitsundays and my favourite place to date would be Whitehaven Beach. Being on the go all the time in a fast-paced job I also can’t go past a good cup of coffee. When it comes to writing, I love to meet residents in the community and find about their life as I feel everyone has an interesting story to tell.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:36:00.140+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
