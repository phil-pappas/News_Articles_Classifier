Go Back To Where You Came From is the most extreme example, but here five twentysomething Kiwis – all from the comfortable middle classes but all at different points in their lives – head to the Philippines for five weeks to taste life on the ground in a developing country. While some are more pleasant than others, they all seem very normal. They’re also all good sports, doing their best to wrangle with the challenges thrown at them, and their journey is as eye-opening for us as it is for them. We start in a computer component factory, which is by no means a sweatshop, making the mind-bending drudgery of the work and the pace at which it must be accomplished even more disturbing. \n800 Words, Seven, 8.40pm \nAdvertisement The structure of 800 Words isn’t complicated, but it works so well. We open with George finishing off his column, then backtrack to see what’s inspired it this week, with the theme of his piece inevitably mirroring the theme of the episode in question. It gives everything a very satisfying shape. Tonight we’re informed that the issue du jour is secrets, and it’s something that plays out on two intertwined but very different levels. There are quirky Weld shenanigans of the kind we’ve become used to. But in this instalment we also address something rather more grave - the relationship between two teens. They hooked up – as teens do - without it becoming much of a thing in the larger storyline. Well, tonight it becomes a thing. And, as has been the case throughout with this intelligent series, it’s managed in a completely believable and even rather moving manner.  \nKa-ching! Pokie Nation, ABC, 9.30pm \nThis documentary was still being updated at the last minute, but based on recent ABC productions it should be a cracker. Ad guru thelate Neil Lawrence and documentary maven Mitzi Goldman have collaborated on an exposé of not just the harm done in Australia by poker machines, but the extraordinary science that goes into making sure that harm is done – and of course government reliance, at all levels, on the income from that harm. \nMelinda Houston", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T01:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T05:22:28.421+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
