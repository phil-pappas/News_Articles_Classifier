Kigel’s work is currently included in the Sumi-e Society’s 2015 Annual Exhibition in Mobile, Ala., juried by the distinguished sumi-e master Shozo Sato. \nA native of Warren, Kigel said that her paintings for Tidemark Gallery demonstrate the art of less — “Never do more, when less will do.” By stripping away color in a composition, she de-clutters an image into its basic elements of light, shade and texture. The difficulty comes in making these elements as potent as possible. \nKigel seeks a minimalistic effect, creating art with a simple juxtaposition of ink and empty space.; in most of her paintings, a red “chop” provides the sole bit of color of the show’s title. In some works, the chop is meant to be the first thing that attracts the eye; in other works, it serves more as the end point. In several of the works in this show, Kigel adds also tones of yellow, green, blue and sienna. Subjects include animals, plants, and landscapes. \nUnframed work is available, in addition to work hung on walls. The show will continue through Nov. 15. Gallery hours are Wednesdays through Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. For more information, call Tidemark Gallery at 832-5109. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
