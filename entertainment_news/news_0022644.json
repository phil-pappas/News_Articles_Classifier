Music Revolt, online at musicrevolt.org , is a nonprofit music advocacy group recently launched to educate musicians about the industry and their rights. \"Killswitch,\" a documentary, highlights issues about Payola and collusion and their effects on the industry. It can be viewed on the website, and will be screened in some theaters early next year. The Payola laws, enacted in 1960, were created to prohibit big record labels from paying off radio stations to promote and play its bands, thus allowing fair air play for smaller labels. (\"Payola\" combines the words \"pay\" and \"Victrola\".) But Kirby says the law has not done what was intended. Instead, he said, it has halted synergy among the music industry, broadcasters and artists, resulting in a mixed-up market that leaves musicians making less and less money. “Payola laws need to be revised or amended,” Kirby said. “Ninety-nine percent of the people have never heard of them. They are not enforceable, and it did not create a level playing field because collusion is still rampant.” Kirby, who moved to Worcester from California, says the city is ideal to spread his message because of its many colleges, drawing young people, and its abundance of budding musicians and lively music scene. He screened an earlier documentary, \"Music Matters,\" at WPI last year. Kirby was once a music promoter for bands such as Kool and the Gang, Prince, and Laura Branigan, and is a singer, bass player, songwriter, and music reviewer. “I have seen all of the ugliness unfold firsthand,” he said of the music business. Music, like many other industries, has been changed by the Internet, with radio taking a back seat to online streaming. Only a few big record companies remain, and they no longer need promoters, nor production factories, maintaining inventory, and transportation for records and CDs. Digitized music streaming sites, such as Spotify and Pandora, offer some free services, meaning a musician whose song is played at no charge on personal devices millions of times a year can expect about $4,000 annually. Taylor Swift withdrew her music from Spotify for that reason. Apple and Amazon, Kirby said, engage in price fixing, with songs and albums costing the same as they did nearly 15 years ago — generally around $1 for a single, and $10 for an album. Musicians, he said, end up with a fraction of that. Besides revising Payola laws to create a free marketplace, Kirby said Music Revolt’s goals include: eliminating illegal price fixing and allowing musicians to charge whatever they want and be in control of the price of their music; allowing fair, transparent contracts between musicians and record labels or publishers, giving musicians the power to terminate previous contracts that don’t benefit them; and educating musicians about the business and legal aspects of the industry. Lobbying legislators is one solution, he said, as well as uniting musicians and fans against collusion. “There are no more broadcast professionals. That’s why the music industry is so incredibly screwed up,” he said. “I want it to be better for musicians and music lovers. The industry is not going to change unless we force it to.” Kirby suggests a business model such as Netflix’s streaming movies, in which a monthly fee — higher than currently charged on music streaming sites — is charged. He would also like to find a way to tell listeners about the bands they might like, and expose artists to more fans. Music Revolt also wants to enlighten musicians about U.S. copyright laws. Often, Kirby said, musicians eager to sign with a publisher or record company will sign away their rights to songs, sometimes forever. That means songs can be used for commercials — for cars, adult diapers, Viagra — even if an artist does not approve. Kirby says under copyright laws, musicians can recapture those rights after 35 years, sometimes sooner. Rick O’Neal, a bass player with the Delta Generators and a music tutor at Eastern Connecticut State University, agrees that the best way to improve the industry is to educate musicians about the business of music and contracts, and to connect directly to fans via a band’s website or at live performances, or through online companies such as CD Baby and Framingham-based Nimbit, where musicians sell their own material and connect with fans. O’Neal said to make a living as a musician, one needs 1,000 of what he described as “true fans,” meaning they buy every CD produced and attend all live shows in their area. To accomplish that, O’Neal said, a musician needs contact and demographic information about fans, something not provided by iTunes or Amazon. O’Neal said musicians earning bachelor’s degrees in music don’t get classes on business, copyright laws, contracts and publishing. If they don’t attend college — and many don’t — it’s just as difficult to figure out who they need to register songs with (BMI, ASCAP, etc.) and how to negotiate contracts. But, in contrast to what Kirby said, he said artists are sometimes thrilled to get a large advance, sometimes six figures, for their future publishing rights. “If the song makes it big, you’re going to earn money anyway, and if it doesn’t, you still got the big advance,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:00:55.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
