With the release of Ajith’s upcoming movie Vedhalam’s teaser release Thala Ajith is yet again the talk of the town. The actor is seen sporting a sexy salt and pepper look for this fast paced movie directed by Siva and produced by A M Rathnam. \nApart from Ajith Kumar, the movie stars Shruti Haasan, Lakshmi Menon, Aniket Chouhan and kabir Singh. But the teaser gave away only the protagonist’s introduction away. Shruti Haasan was nowhere to be seen in the Vedhalam teaser that was released last night. But it is for the first time that the beauty will be seen romancing Ajith. Anirudh is the music composer for Vedhalam who has been recently praised for his musical work in the industry. \nAfter the first look of Ajith, the teaser of Vedhalam has garnered a lot of attention from all the Thala fans. Right from the beginning they are looking forward to this upcoming movie breaking all records set by other movies on the box office. Also it is being said that Ajith will yet again play a double role in this movie. Will that mean double entertainment for the fans? Well only time will tell how this movie will fare at the box office as the movie is set for a festive release this Diwali season. (Ajith haunts you with his dialogue delivery) \nNonetheless the fans are going crazy over the release of the Vedhalam teaser. They took to micro blogging website Twitter to share their excitement about this action packed Ajith’s upcoming movie. Did You know..?
