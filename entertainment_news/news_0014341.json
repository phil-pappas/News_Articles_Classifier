Award-winning story writer Lorrie Moore will introduce this special \"Selected Shorts\" performance on Oct. 21, featuring famous short stories read by actors Jane Kaczmarek and Liev Schreiber, among others. \nEvents marking the 100th birthday of singer Edith Piaf and author and playwright Arthur Miller are scheduled for later in the month, as well as a night discussing Einstein's Theory of Relativity , which also turned 100 this year. \nTickets for the Sinatra centennial are $45 for preferred seating and $35 for standard seating. Prices for members are $36 and $28. Tickets for anyone under 30 are $20 each. The three shows for the price of two deal is only available by phone by calling (212) 864-5400.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T22:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:57:53.537+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
