Main khane ka shaukeen hoon, aur achcha khana khake mood achcha ho jata hai !\" Coming back to his performance in the city, Mame Khan says, \"There were people in the audience aged 18 to 60 years. In the last 7-8 years, a lot of youngsters are also giving a good response to folk and Sufi music, which means that our country's musical traditions will not be forgotten in the future.\"\nAsk the Manganiar singer if he works extra hard to make his music appealing for the younger audience, and he replies, \" Thoda music mein change karna padta hai. The youngsters like a higher tempo, and I try and alter the music accordingly. Ek lalach rehta hai ki young log bhi hamari music suney.\" Khan, who has collaborated with Bollywood music directors for playback as well, says that while film music gives folk artists like him a lot of visibility, it's social media that has done wonders for them. \"It has helped us so much in reaching out to people across the country. Yes, Bollywood support means a lot, but the visibility that being present on social media gives, is immense .\"\nThe diplomatic Mame Khan also says that music reality shows on TV are great for promoting regional talent, but adds more candidly , \"The audience that votes for singers in these shows needs to have greater trust in the regional folk singers. For instance, there was Moti Khan, a Rajasthani singer, in Indian Idol Jr this year. He could not even reach the finals. And he was a great singer, and deserved to be in the finals. I supported him here in Mumbai all through the show, but the audience voted him out.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T15:27:17.523+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
