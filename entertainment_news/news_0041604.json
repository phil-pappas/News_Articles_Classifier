By Brian Selznick. Scholastic Press. 640 pages. $32.99. \nA long time ago in a land far away a young girl named Carole Emily woke one morning to her legs pocked with peculiar purple bruises and her feet as big as gourds. Doctors poked and prodded and shook their heads. \n\"Have you ever?\" they asked. \n'\"Never!\" they harrumphed. \nBecause in that land far away at that time long ago no one knew what sinister things stirred in Carole Emily's blood. \nCarole Emily needed to be watched, they said. \nCarole Emily needed to be studied, they insisted. \nAnd so Carole Emily went to a place where other children whose bodies were behaving mysteriously were sent. \nCarole Emily tried to be brave and strong, but her feet ached and the bedsheets itched. Then one day a wise teacher with silver hair and kind eyes sent Carole Emily a shopping bag overflowing with enchantment and wonder, mystery and adventure. For six weeks, Carole Emily survived shipwrecks and sword fights, romances and rebellions, journeys beneath the sea and to the center of the earth, and, in time, she fought off the strange illness that seized her. \nYears later when Carole Emily was all grown up with children of her own, she never forgot about the power of stories to restore a spirit and nurture a soul, but sometimes Carole Emily wished she could once again experience the childlike wonder and awe that helped heal her younger self. \nThen she picked up Brian Selznick's \"The Marvels\" (Scholastic Press), and the young Carole Emily appeared in a wave of nostalgia and awe. Before she even began to read, Carole Emily placed the beautifully designed bumper book in her lap, and traced her fingers over the cobalt blue cover, outlining its intricate gold etchings of dragons and stars and a sailing ship until her fingers rested on a tiny ribbon of words: \"You either see it or you don't.\" \nBecause inside this enchanting book is an adventure story concealing a family history that's hiding a mystery about the lives inside a renovated Victorian mansion where stepping through its doors is taking \"a voyage back in time.\" \n\"The Marvels\" opens in 1766 with 400 pages of mesmerizing sketches presenting the story of five generations of a legendary London theatre family whose chronicle we need no words to follow. The second four hundred pages are in prose, transporting us from London of the 19th century to the city in 1990 with only a handful of clues pointing to the connections between both parts of the book. In the prose narrative, young Joseph Jervis has run away from his stifling boarding school to the Victorian mansion of his eccentric estranged uncle, a man whose heart is frozen with grief and whose life is trapped in the details of the Victorian world he's re-created inside his house. \n\"The Marvels\" is a book about Shakespeare and shipwrecks, families and forgiveness, but more than anything it's a book about how the stories we tell may contain more truth about the world – \"its miracles and its sadness\" – than anything else we do. Stories matter. They must be cared for, loved and shared. \n\"You either see it or you don't.\" Carole Emily closed the book and wiped a bittersweet tear. She did. And she was thrilled to tell everyone about it. IF YOU GO \nWhen: 7 p.m. Oct. 12 \nWhere: Alverno College's Pitman Theatre, 3431 S. 39th St. © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc.
