He is not a selfish player at all,” Xinhua quoted Ancelotti as saying on Wednesday.”I played him in midfield at Madrid because we needed to find a solution after Sami Khedira got injured. He did very well in midfield. \n“But I do not think that is his best position. He is even better in attack. He could play on either wing and even as a centre forward,” added the experienced Italian.Di Maria, who played a key role in Real’s Champions League triumph under Ancelotti in 2014, has played six out of nine Ligue 1 matches so far this season for PSG, started for four times and scored twice. \nModified Date: October 8, 2015 10:02 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:06:43.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
