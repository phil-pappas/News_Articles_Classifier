(Photo: Greg Peters, WGN America)\n8 CONNECT 10 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE The atomic bomb moves from theory to reality in Season 2 of WGN America's Manhattan (Tuesday, 9 p.m. ET/6 p.m. PT).\nThe searing drama, which focuses on the World War II-era physicists who developed the bomb and their families, looks at the months leading up to the real-life Trinity Test in the New Mexico desert in July 1945.\n\"If the show moved at a breakneck pace as far as how high the stakes were last season, this season doubles down and the acceleration toward Trinity is of utmost importance,\" says John Benjamin Hickey, who plays the brilliant physicist Frank Winter.The series was created by Sam Shaw and features The West Wing 's Thomas Schlamme as an executive producer and director.\nWhat Frank may be looking at is another matter. He was swept away by military officials, a bag covering his head, at the end of the first season after a hidden microphone recorded him telling his wife, Liza (Olivia Williams), the top-secret purpose of his scientific work in Los Alamos.\nFrank, aware of the microphone, \"threw himself under the bus,\" Hickey says, confessing to an internal conspiracy partly to gain the freedom of another physicist, Charlie Isaacs (Ashley Zukerman).\n\"He sacrificed himself â€¦ for the sake of his project, for the sake of his family one might argue,\" Hickey says. \"He gets himself into an enormous amount of trouble. The trouble he finds himself in and the way the military deals with him opens Frank's eyes.\"\nRachel Brosnahan, left, plays Abby Isaacs and Katja Herbers plays Helen Prins in WGN America's 'Manhattan.' (Photo: Greg Peters, WGN America)\nManhattan , which averaged 1.1 million viewers last season (WGN America reaches 62% of U.S. households), opens Season 2 with Frank absent from The Hill, the classified community where the physicists work on the bomb.\n\"He gets thrown into a very specific kind of pokey, a military top-secret prison that I think has echoes of Guantanamo Bay and some of the images we saw come out of Iraq,\" says Hickey, calling it \"a very Kafkaesque labyrinth of government bureaucracy and secrecy that is maddening and causes him to do some serious reconsidering of the objective of why (they're) all there.\"\nBack at Los Alamos, Charlie is in charge of the bomb team, with time jumps and flashbacks covering the months leading up to The Trinity Test.\nThe camp also has a new military leader, Col. Emmitt Darrow ( CSI 's William Petersen).\nDarrow \"takes over the Army responsibility. He's determined to get the bomb built,\" Petersen says. \"He's very religious. He's an interesting man.\"\nHe praises the realistic appearance of the Santa Fe set. \"It was like reliving being there and building the atomic bomb. The sets that they built were exact replicas of the way the Army and the physicists lived back in 1944 and 1945, trying to beat the Germans to the nuclear weapons.\"\nCol. Emmett Darrow (William Petersen) meets with Liza Winter (Olivia Williams) in a scene from WGN America's 'Manhattan.' (Photo: Greg Peters, WGN America)\nOther cast additions include Mamie Gummer as Nora, a member of the Women's Army Corps; Griffin Dunne as Woodrow Lorentzen, a reporter who gains access to The Hill; and Neve Campbell as Kitty Oppenheimer, the wife of the head of the Los Alamos project, J. Robert Oppenheimer (Daniel London).\nHickey, who appears in Truth , an upcoming film about the events surrounding Dan Rather's coverage of President George W. Bush's National Guard service, says he can envision a long run for Manhattan , one that could follow the physicists as they see the consequences of their work.\n\"I sure hope we do\" continue with the story, he says. \"What happened to these men and women after the test and after Nagasaki and Hiroshima is every bit as compelling on a human and dramatic level as what happened to them when they were doing it.\"\n8 CONNECT 10 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1RD2IoE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RD2IoE&text=%27Manhattan%27%20ticks%20toward%20Season%202%20A-bomb%20test&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/43e7d1526dd1c34bf4d24a19d93284b216797b45/c=83-0-1917-1379&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635800048690102649-Manhattan-Rachel-Brosnahan-Katje-Herbers.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RD2IoE&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ced5cf14d376f505b54f6bd882f009db1ff39c52/c=137-0-1936-1353&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635800039786657576-Manhattan-John-Benjamin-Hickey.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a57cb87523081f89514984f1cf4f0c13e0b2f571/r=500x338/local/-/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635800039786657576-Manhattan-John-Benjamin-Hickey.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1RD2IoE", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/96abae8492922aff611c1e3183d1abf5b8208a8f/c=120-0-1881-1324&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635800044390559088-Manhattan-William-Petersen-Olivia-Williams.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635800039786657576-Manhattan-John-Benjamin-Hickey.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T23:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:06:19.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
