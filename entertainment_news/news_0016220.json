Two black cops who reported a boss for using a racial slur say they were viciously chewed out by an African-American chief in the NYPD and are now planning a lawsuit.\nAssistant Chief Gerald Nelson went ballistic after Officer Shelron Smikle made a June 10 report to the Internal Affairs Bureau charging that a black sergeant at the 83rd Precinct dropped the N-bomb on him.\nTwo days later, Nelson , the commander of Patrol Borough Brooklyn North, ordered Smikle, 28, and his partner, Blanch O'Neal , 38, to his office, they told the Daily News in an interview.\n\"'We have friends in IAB, and you're full of s--t!'\" Nelson screamed, according to Smikle and O'Neal. \"So what, he [the sergeant] called you a n----r? If you can't handle it, resign!'\"\nSmikle, who was born on the Caribbean island of Jamaica , said he also complained that the sergeant told him \"to go back to [his] country\" and referred to him as a \"dollar van driver.\"\n\"So what, he said that to you?\" Nelson allegedly responded.\n\"'Get the f--k out of my office! It doesn't matter if this conversation is being recorded. I'm not saying anything wrong.'\"\nThe cops said they were shocked by Nelson's alleged racial insensitivity in repeating the slur.\n\"It's not acceptable for a chief in charge ... to say that,\" Smikle said. \"It's a slap in the face.\"\nThe two cops have hired lawyer Eric Sanders of the firm Jeffrey Goldberg in Lake Success , L.I., to file a federal complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , a precursor to filing a lawsuit.\n\"Chief Nelson is African-American, and we would expect as a police executive he would have responded differently,\" Sanders said.\n\"If he feels this way, what does it say about how they treat the public in Brooklyn North?\"\nCairo for News The cops say when Assistant Chief Gerald Nelson (above) found out they had lodged a complaint about a black sergeant’s N-word-laced rant, Nelson repeated the N-word. O'Neal and Smikle say the problem started when they were dumped on foot patrol on a 97-degree day because the keys to their radio car were missing, which they say was due to a prank.\nA black sergeant lit into Smikle for being in the stationhouse instead of being out in the streets and allegedly spewed racial epithets that were overheard by O'Neal.\nLater that day, the cops fell sick from heat exhaustion, then called the IAB and the office of equal employment opportunity to lodge complaints about the sergeant.\nNelson acknowledged that he reamed the cops for going to the IAB, told them their allegations were false and threw them out of his office.\nHe adamantly denies he used the N-word, however.\n\"I never use that language,\" Nelson said. \"That is an absolute lie. You guys print whatever you like, but if you print that, you're printing a lie.\"\nNelson also warned that the cops' complaints would get them in more trouble.\n\"Now I have to open an investigation. If I see this in the paper, I will discipline them again. I don't need this in my career,\" he told The News. \"But it comes with the territory.\"\nNelson's mouth has landed him in hot water before.\nWhen he was in charge of the school-safety division in 2005, he allegedly referred to angry parents as \"b", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:09:33.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
