The hunky actor was completely unrecognizable when he donned a costume inspired by Ursula the Sea Witch, a character from Disney's \" The Little Mermaid (1989) \". The \" Arrow \" actor took to Instagram on Saturday, October 24 to share some pictures and videos of him in the said costume. Colton sported pale skin, white hair-rising wig and black robe. He also donned black gown featuring pink pattern and plunging neckline. He left one of his nipples uncovered. \"Poor unfortunate souls #Ursula,\" he wrote alongside one of the pictures.

It appeared that his mask stuck to his skin so that he needed extra effort to take it off. The video also revealed that the nipple he bared when he donned the costume was a part of the mask. \"I woke up like this,\" read the caption.
