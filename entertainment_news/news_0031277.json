Well, in my opinion fantasy movies can go a long way in making Tamil cinema more formidable among its competitors. \nSuch movies can allure its audience by taking them into a whole new world. After all, an excellent movie is the one which makes you forget about and surroundings and fantasy flicks can achieve that feat with ease, if executed properly. \nFantasy films and Tamil cinema were once close allies as this film industry has produced some wonderful movies that falls under this genre in the past. \nWith all the technological advancement, such films were expected to flourish in Kollywood.
