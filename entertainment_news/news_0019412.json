DNA tests are being conducted. It was determined how the suicide bombers got there. We're close to a name, which points to one group,\" he said of the worst attack in Turkey of its kind.\nTwo senior security sources told Reuters on Sunday that initial signs suggested Islamic State was behind the attack, and that it bore striking similarity to a July suicide bombing in Suruc near the Syrian border, also blamed on the radical Islamists.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T22:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:43:19.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
