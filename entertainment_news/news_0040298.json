Nearly half of all vehicles in the country are diesel based, compared to a relatively small number in the United States. \nGerman Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt said the country’s KBA automotive watchdog had ordered Volkswagen to start a mandatory recall of 2.4 million vehicles at the beginning of 2016. \nThe KBA is giving Volkswagen until the end of the month to develop a software fix for all 2.0 liter vehicles affected by the recall. \nThe company will also have until the end of November to come up with a technical solution for 1.6 and 1.2 liter vehicles. \nThe original recall affected 2.8 million vehicles. Officials in Germany later realized that 400,000 of those vehicles were no longer on the road. \nOn Tuesday, Volkswagen said it would cut investment plans at its core VW division by 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) a year through 2019 and step up the development of electric and hybrid vehicles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:42:51.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
