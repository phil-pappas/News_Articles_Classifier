My first restaurant was Thai Passion in Biloxi, Miss. I worked and lived with Thai chefs. Their culture teaches the importance of balance, both in cuisine and in life. Favorite ingredient: Currently, I’m crushing on PCB Chef Paul Ashman's Smoked Pecan Sea Salt, made from our own local waters and smoked for 14 hours over pecan shells. That stuff could make cardboard taste good! Favorite local eatery: J. Michael’s. Always has been. Always will be. No. 1 pet peeve: Cooks that smash burgers while cooking and waste all that beautiful flavor and juice. Stop it! Stop it now! If you could choose, what would be your last meal?
