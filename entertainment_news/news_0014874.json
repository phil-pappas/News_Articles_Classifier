Dozier / McClatchy-Tribune) Former White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen adds film cameo to his resume \nAdd \"passerby\" to Ozzie Guillen's resume. \nThe former White Sox manager makes a cameo in a 12-minute movie that filmed last week in Chicago. \n\"Business Unusual,\" about two business travelers who arrive in Chicago to present a sales pitch, was filmed Thursday at O'Hare International Airport and Friday and Saturday at the Renaissance Chicago Downtown Hotel. Guillen shot his cameo Oct. 5, according to a rep for the hotel. \nIn the scene, the protagonist's briefcase pops open and contents fly everywhere, according to the rep. As he walks by, Guillen says, \"They don't call it the Windy City for nothing.\" \nThis isn't Guillen's first film appearance. Guillen, who managed the White Sox for eight seasons including the 2005 World Series Championship season, appeared in the 2007 film \"Champions of Faith (Baseball Edition).\" He has been an ESPN commentator since getting fired from his Miami Marlins managing job in 2012.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T16:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:06:58.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
