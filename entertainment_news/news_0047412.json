The pair, who ended their marriage in September last year, reunited and posed for cozy selfie. In the snap that Amber shared on her Instagram, she was seen pouting for the camera as rapper Wiz cozied up by her side. They, moreover, were pictured resting their heads against one another. She captioned the image, \"Still Ballin,\" and a loved-up emoji. A photo posted by Amber Rose (@amberrose) on Oct 5, 2015 at 12:23am PDT The cozy photo sent fans giddy with excitement as they expressed their willingness for the exes, who share a son named Sebastian, to get back together. \"Please get back together!\" one fan commented. \"OMG pls be back together I love you guys!\" another fan chimed in. \"Pls say it's so,\" added another fan. On Saturday, October 3, Amber admitted at her SlutWalk event in Los Angeles that it was \"extremely hurtful\" to hear Wiz refer to her as just a \"stripper\" in a song. \"[Wiz] went on to make a song saying that he fell in love with a stripper, but fell out of love quicker. As you can imagine, him being the love of my life, regardless of us going through a separation or not it was extremely hurtful,\" she revealed while sobbing. \"Wiz actually apologized to me already, so I have forgiven him,\" she added. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:32:52.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
