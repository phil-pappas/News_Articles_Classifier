Scotland Yard's macabre Crime Museum goes on public display A forged British 10 shilling note from the late 1950's is displayed as part of the Crime Museum Uncovered exhibition at the Museum of London in the City of London, Wednesday, Oct. 7, 2015. Drawn from Scotland Yard's private collection, the show charts more than a century of violence and suffering, from the murders of Jack the Ripper to IRA and al-Qaida bombings. But it also celebrates the brains, bravery and scientific advances that helped catch perpetrators and solve crimes. (AP Photo/Alastair Grant) Most Read \nNeed a Profile?
