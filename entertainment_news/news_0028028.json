Melissa Hoyer with Rebel Wilson Source: News Corp Australia \nShe drew the line at actually getting up there on the runway, preferring to wear it on the comfort of the red carpet. \n“My label is called Rebel Wilson for Torrid (a plus-size fashion line), so hopefully people won’t get it confused with Rebel Sport,” said the comedic actor. \n“It’s actually been really fun to design to be honest and it goes on sale in three weeks. \n“And as a special deal to all Australians I’m going to give you 50% off for shipping, so isn’t that a great deal!” \n(Love how you never know what to take seriously from Rebel Wilson). Rebel with Hugh Sheridan Source: News Corp Australia \nRebel says she has two films in the can that will go to air next year and had just finished a Sacha Baron Cohen movie. \n“There are some really disgusting things in it, but hey!,” she smiled. \n“I had a sex scene with Sacha Baron Cohen and it was just the most disgusting \nthing ever.” \n(Ditto you never quite know what to believe). \nMeanwhile, our Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, taking just a few hours out of her constant and current refugee situation and talks with the Philippines, again reiterated her commitment to promoting our creative talent to the rest of the world.
