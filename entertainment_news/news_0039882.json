Marvel. Written by Gerry Duggan. Art by Nicole Virella. \nI've been bullish on this four-issue miniseries dating back to a great twist in #2. #3 was a great follow up, introducing both Old Timey Iron Man and setting up an unfortunate accident for one apothecary named Bruce Banner. The conclusion to the series in #4? Well, I can't say that it was bad (because it did setup some things for future books), but it just felt hollow — the climax of the series has come and gone by the time we get to the end of this issue. Still, the last couple of pages got me, and a promise that \"The Avengers of the West\" will return has me interested in either Marvel's new \"Red Wolf\" series that will debut in December or some other unannounced work. So while #4 did a less than satisfying job of finishing \"1872,\" it did provide the foundation for something nice going forward...so at least there's that? \n[Editor's note: The advanced emoji-based GUESS machine is still locked away in a time vortex alternate reality.

Art by Dan Schoening and Brent Schoonover. \nThis book was so special it got its own mega review . TL;DR: Not bad. \nGUESS: :-O, :-D, >:\\ \nLast week's leftovers \nCIVIL WAR #5. Marvel. Written by Charles Soule. Art by Leinil Francis Yu. \nWhen Armond Boudreaux and I discussed the original \"Civil War\" a few weeks ago, we didn't even have space to talk about the new \"Secret Wars\" miniseries written by Charles Soule that just concluded with issue #5. Soule's work is an interesting \"what if\" that imagines a world where the fight over the Superhero Registration Act never ended and instead resulted in a country that is literally divided in two, with Captain America leading the individualistic West (\"The Blue\") and Iron Man heading the industrialized East (\"The Iron\"). \nHere's what Boudreaux had to say about the new miniseries: \n\"There's a really terrible moment at the end of the first issue. Miriam Sharpe –– the mother of one of the children killed at the Stamford incident –– is assassinated during the meeting that she has arranged between Steve and Tony. When Steve realizes that the shot that killed Sharpe was intended for him, he tells Tony, 'The next time I see you will be to accept your surrender.' Tony denies his involvement, and there's a note of sadness in Steve's reply: 'Does it matter?' This is the point that they have reached: all that matters anymore is the conflict. \n\"I think that the real contribution of this new 'Civil War' series is the idea that the while Tony and Steve war with one another, the real enemy plays them against one another and perpetuates the conflict for her own purposes. This might be a real insight into the actual state of things. While we in the U.S. duke it out over domestic policy, we have to be careful about threats from outside. When do disputes about policy become a distraction?\" \nUltimately (as Boudreaux and I discussed) this \"Civil War\" series does not have the impact or importance of the original. But that doesn't mean it's not worth reading. For one, the final issue does a good job of bring the series to a close, and there are some really nice moments with Captain America and Iron Man during the climactic battle between the Iron and the Blue. The post-fight coda also raises an interesting question: How will this world come back together? The conclusion suggests it will take some time. \nSoule is a master storyteller, and while the 2015 incarnation of \"Civil War\" is no landmark like its predecessor, it is still no deviation from Soule's usual superior standard. \nGUESS: B-), o/\\o, :'-) \nCHEWBACCA #1. Marvel. Written by Gerry Duggan. Art by Phil Noto. \nChewbacca, the latest \"Star Wars\" character to get his own Marvel miniseries after Princess Leia and Lando Calrissian, presents a special problem in that it's difficult to have a main character that doesn't talk. Sure, he growls (Howls? Barks? He does whatever Wookies do, I suppose) but there's never any real dialogue from him. Smartly, writer Gerry Duggan has paired him with a chipper young sidekick to handle most of the talking for this miniseries, and artist Phil Noto did a great job in the first issue in conveying subtle facial expressions. As far as the story goes, we find Chewie crash landed on a planet sometime after the Battle of Endor, He needs to fix his ride, but before he's able to, the Wookie gets wrapped up in trying to help a girl ensnared (with many other people on the planet) in a forced labor mine. With Chewie taking up his crossbow at the end of issue #1 to fight for the slaves, we're set for some righteous (and hairy) vengeance. \nGUESS: (=^・^=), :-), \\o/ \nJUSTICE LEAGUE OF AMERICA #4. DC. Written by Bryan Hitch. Art by Bryan Hitch, Daniel Henriques and Alex Sinclair. \nThis run of \"Justice League of America\" premiered with Rao, a mysterious Kryptonian god, coming to Earth and ushering in a new age of peace and prosperity as he and his priests bless us pitiful humans and cure all of our sickness and hopelessness. Of course, Batman has his doubts (of course Batman would doubt the beginning of a utopia), and he and the rest of the Justice League (aside from Superman, who is enthusiastically pro-Rao) begin to investigate this new god. In issue #4, we finally see that Rao is not everything he appears to be, as we learn that his \"blessings\" are altering both human and Kryptonian DNA. The new \"JLA\" incarnation has been good — writer/artist Bryan Hitch has a knack for telling (and illustrating) grand, epic stories. Ramping up to a full confrontation between the Justice League and Rao should be fun. \nGUESS: >:-), :-D, <|:-) \nBLOOD FEUD #1. Oni. Written by Cullen Bunn. Art by Drew Moss. \n\"Blood Feud\" is the story of three good ol' Ozark boys — R.F. (our narrator), Cecil and Jack — who happen to be in the middle of a generations old fight between two families, the Whatleys and the Stubbs. While the fight has been waging for decades, it takes a turn when one of the families makes a deal with some dark forces and everything starts to go to hell (maybe literally?) for the town of Spider Creek. The setup here is interesting as the reader is not positioned with either of the \"feud\"ing families, but instead, we're stuck between them like the rest of the townsfolk. The dialogue is also crisp and funny — although I can't quite make out whether the book is attempting to parody the Arkansas-ish Midwest or pay homage to it. In either case, it reads like a light take on Southern Gothic, and the colors (vibrant tones and a wide spectrum) suggest a book that's not terribly serious. And really, I'm fine with that. If this book stays on track, we're setup for a lot of vampire killing, family feuding and frog gigging.
