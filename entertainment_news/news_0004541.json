It's quite another to do so at your local firehouse.\nBut Naperville fire and police officials say that's what happened in the case of Zachary J. Long, who was found asleep at 5:21 a.m. Saturday in a reclining chair in the city's main fire station, about five miles south and west of his home on the city's far northeast side.\nLong, 26, lives on the 500 block of Bighorn Road, in Naperville's Lincoln Park neighborhood. He is free on bond and awaiting a hearing in DuPage County Circuit Court, where he is charged with single, misdemeanor counts of criminal trespass to a building and criminal damage to property, according to court records.\nFire department Division Chief Andrew Dina confirmed Long was found inside the main fire station, 1380 Aurora Ave., shortly after firefighters had returned from answering a call for emergency service.\n\"One of our crew members walked into an office and discovered an unknown civilian sleeping in one of the recliners,\" Dina said Wednesday. The man, later identified as Long, had vomited onto the carpeted floor and \"didn't speak when we tried to wake him up, so we checked him out for any medical issues\" and then took him to Edward Hospital in Naperville, he said.\nLong was placed in the custody of Naperville police after undergoing observation and treatment in the hospital's emergency room. Police Cmdr. Jason Arres said Long \"made no statements as to his whereabouts prior to\" being found inside the firehouse.\nPolice searched the parking lots and shared grounds of the fire and police stations, \"and we found no vehicle belonging to (Long) in the area,\" Arres said. He added where police were concerned, \"our investigation is concluded.\"\nNo one is certain how Long managed to get inside the fire station. Dina said firefighters and police found \"no signs of forcible entry\" into the building.\nInspectors from the city's building department subsequently \"checked all the interior and exterior doors\" to the station, \"to make sure they are functioning properly,\" Dina said. He added fire officials are \"reviewing our security and safety policies with our personnel\" in the wake of the incident.\nThe criminal damage to property charge against Long stems from his allegedly having vomited on the floor of the office.\nwbird@tribpub.com\nCopyright Â© 2015, Naperville Sun Crime Naperville", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561eef53/turbine/ct-nvs-naperville-fire-station-sleeper-st-1016-20151014"], "published": "2015-10-15T02:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:53:33.317+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
