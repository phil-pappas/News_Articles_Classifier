With Spectre due out in October, there's been speculation after speculation about who'll replace him. Idris Elba is, far and away, the people's choice to replace Bond whilst unsubstantiated rumours put Damian Lewis in the running to replace Craig.\nHowever, Craig has backtracked on earlier comments that he's done with Bond post-Spectre. \"I'm contracted for one more, but I'm not making predictions.\"\n\"I work myself to death,” Craig explained further on, saying that \"it's getting harder. But such is life. I’ll keep going as long as I’m physically able.\"\nAt 47, Craig's still way younger than the oldest Bond on-screen. That accolade belongs to Roger Moore, who was 58 when he retired from the role with A View To A Kill. Whether he'll continue after his last contracted film remains to be seen. You always sorta get the feeling with Daniel Craig that he's trying to get his foot out the door with Bond, that he's locked into it.\nIn a way, it informs his performance because Craig's iteration of Bond is a much more human, wounded one than we've ever seen. If he does decide to leave after Spectre, he'll be leaving with good innings. Very of the Bond actors can comfortably say their run was as successful as his.\nVia DM.co.uk\nMORE: Sean Connery was supposed to have a MUCH bigger role in Skyfall\nMORE: Watch: The final promo for Spectre drops and it looks phenomenal\nMORE: Sam Mendes says he's done with Bond after Spectre", "external_links": ["http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/event/article-3247750/Bond-Spectre-Daniel-Craig-s-like-alter-ego.html"], "published": "2015-10-02T01:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T13:35:15.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
