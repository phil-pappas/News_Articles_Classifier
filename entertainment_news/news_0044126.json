So far only 7 percent of new vehicles moving off dealers' lots have forward collision warning, adaptive cruise control or automatic emergency braking.\nThe penetration rate on blind-spot detection is only 4 percent; lane departure warning/lane keep assist, 7 percent; adaptive front lighting. 4 percent and on night vision, only a minuscule 0.2 percent, mostly luxury cars, have it.\n\"Market dynamics will not be enough to drive these adoption rates up fast enough,\" Mosquet said.\nThe study suggests several incentives for consumers to seek out these features, including tax credits. Another idea is to offer automakers credits they can apply to the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards as they sell more safety features.\nThe problem is consumers aren't willing to pay what it costs manufacturers and suppliers to install these features.\nFor example, a recent survey found most car owners would be willing to pay between $100 and $400 for blind-spot detection, but the current cost is about $595.\nOne obvious way to accelerate adoption is for the government to mandate them, as it has done with rearview cameras, which must be installed in all new vehicles by 2018. The benefit of mandates is that wider adoption drives down the cost. The average cost of a rearview camera system has dropped from $722 per vehicle in 2010 to $550 today. BCG estimates that by 2020 the average cost will fall to $418.\n(c)2015 Detroit Free Press\nVisit the Detroit Free Press at www.freep.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/business/businessnews/s-1731731", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/business/businessnews/s-1731731&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/business/businessnews/s-1731731&h=Consumers+slow+to+adopt+newest+safety+features"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T12:30:57.851+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
