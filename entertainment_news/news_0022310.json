Milwaukee Avenue in downtown Libertyville became available, the Saladino family decided to open a restaurant offering the types of dishes they enjoyed Sundays at grandma's house.\n\"We were talking about it, a long time when there wasn't a good Italian restaurant here,\" said Patty Saladino. \"We were the one and only.\"\nrelated advertisement So began Trattoria Pomigliano, combining the Italian word for a place where the homestyle offerings were what the cook decided to make that day and the birthplace of Saladino's father in Italy. Through the years, all the children and grandchildren have been involved in various jobs.\n\"My father's dream was always to own his own restaurant,\" said Saladino, co-owner and manager. \"It's a family affair.\"\nHowever, much has changed in the area and Libertyville has evolved into such a popular restaurant and activity center that another parking garage is being built to to accommodate visitors.\nSo, why leave the prime corner and relocate to 160 E. Cook Ave., a side street off the main drag? Rent had continued to increase and costly building repairs and equipment upgrades were needed. In an admitted gamble, the family opted to reinvent its brand, with the motto \"Old Traditions -- New Additions\" and is making a significant investment to repurpose an office building into a contemporary locale. Again, the family is taking a chance.\nWith the fresh, modern look, comes an abbreviated name: Pomigliano.\n\"We had a great location. It was very successful for us but the building was getting old and tired,\" Saladino said.\nIn June, the family closed the restaurant and has continued with an overhaul of a family-owned office building. MainStreet Libertyville remains as a tenant in the rear, but the front of the building has been gutted and is being rebuilt in a contemporary design featuring elements from Europe and California. Those include glass \"nana doors\" imported from Italy that fold accordion style to an open air patio fronting Cook Avenue.\nChef Brian Abbott, referred by a close friend, will be at the helm.\n\"These are all grandma's recipes and Brian is going to make it happen,\" Saladino said. Her mother Ann -- known as \"Grandma\" or \"Nini\" -- has been a presence in the kitchen from the beginning and at 89 is anxious to get back at it.\n\"Grandma has a lot of steam left,\" Saladino said.\nAbbott, who is commuting from Highland, Indiana, said the menu has been streamlined from a folder-style to a single sheet. Old favorites like lasagna and other traditional dishes will be available, but more emphasis is placed on steaks, chops and fish.\n\"This is all very comfortable for me,\" Abbott said. \"I just need to get grandma's flair on it and we're good to go.\"\nThe new restaurant seats about 70, fewer than the original location, but there is more patio space and the entry features a courtyard with a fire pit.\nPatty's husband, Nick, said the restaurant has a good following. Many customers likely will walk over from the neighborhood but the business also has a parking lot, which is \"big in Libertyville,\" he added.\n\"Sometimes, you've got to try something and go with it,\" he said. \"We like to say, 'We'll be cookin' on Cook Street.'\"\nA grand reopening is expected no later than mid-November.\n@dhmickzawislak\nRelated Article\nChanges on tap for downtown Libertyville dining scene Related Article\nPlan for more parking in downtown Libertyville moves to design stage Business News Dining Libertyville Video", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share", "https://twitter.com/dhMickZawislak"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:09:40.123+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
