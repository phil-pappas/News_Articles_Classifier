He and his wife, Mellissa, later traveled on another airline to L.A., where they boarded the final leg to Melbourne without incident, Mellissa told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.\nAfter he was detained, Newman appealed the government's decision to Australia's High Court in Melbourne. His lawyers argued their client had never incited violence and the revocation of his visa was therefore flawed.\nHigh Court Justice Geoffrey Nettle disagreed, ruling that Newman posed a threat \"to the good order of the Australian community.\" The judge said Newman willfully disobeyed Australia's immigration laws by boarding the flight to Melbourne.\n\"He does not come to this court with clean hands,\" Nettle said.\nPlay Video Video Planned Parenthood hearing turns into heated exchange Republican lawmakers presented Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards with a hard line of questioning during Tuesday's hearing. They slamm...\nNewman had planned to deliver a series of talks organized by the anti-abortion group Right to Life Australia, and was expected to discuss the controversy over the handling of fetal tissue by Planned Parenthood. The U.S. women's health organization has faced scrutiny since an American anti-abortion group released secret recordings it claimed showed Planned Parenthood employees illegally selling fetal tissue for profit.\nPlanned Parenthood, which offers patients contraception, sexual disease testing, cancer screenings and abortions, has said a tiny fraction of their clinics provide fetal tissue for scientific research, and said it had never broken any laws.\nButler, the Labor lawmaker, said Australians are a welcoming people, but don't take kindly to those who flout the law.\n\"To think he is above the law gives us an insight into the sort of person we are dealing with,\" she told reporters after the court's decision. \"We don't welcome extremists into our country and we don't welcome extremism.\"\nNewman's case marks Australia's second recent high-profile visa controversy. Last week, the Australian government warned troubled R&B singer Chris Brown that he is likely to be denied a visa because of his criminal conviction for assaulting pop star Rihanna.", "external_links": ["http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/09/29/a4a42224-8d8f-41ff-b8a2-ece4cd774fce/thumbnail/220x140/7e1405dbb85e796f0e3b951ff76ee99f/cbsplannedparents0929449802640x360.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T20:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:24:58.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
