Brett Lee, star of the new film unindian muses on how he stumped 119 scenes.\nPT1M51S http://www.canberratimes.com.au/action/externalEmbeddedPlayer?id=d-44984 620 349 October 9, 2015 Autoplay On Off Video feedback Video settings It wasn't like he had to shoot a sex scene. But even the intimacy of kissing in his first real acting role was surprisingly intimidating for Brett Lee.\n\"I knew there was going to be some kissing involved and I had to really think to myself, 'Is this what I want to do?'\" the former Australian cricketer says of starring in the romantic comedy UnIndian . \"If you want to look like you are in love on set, you've got to make sure you give it your best shot and you've got to have that spark.\n\"But I was nervous and I was anxious and all those emotions rolled into one because I was doing it for my first time. When someone says 'kiss' and you have get in there and have a kiss, I was like, 'Wow'.\"\nNew tack: Tannishtha Chatterjee as Meera and Brett Lee as Will in UnIndian. \nLee plays Will, a teacher of Australian language and culture who falls for an Indian-Australian career woman, Meera (Tannishtha Chatterjee​ from Brick Lane and Anna Karenina ), whose family wants her to marry a nice Indian man.\nAdvertisement Sounding surprisingly coy for a fast-bowler who terrorised batsmen until his retirement from international cricket three years ago, Lee says the love scenes were so awkward that he needed Chatterjee's teasing to calm him down.\n\"I've always been, if I'm with someone, I'm with them a 100 per cent,\" he says. \"My wife said if you're going to do it, you've got to get in there and do it properly. So to have her blessing really helped.\nOpening up: Anupam Sharma on set with Brett Lee and Tannishtha Chatterjee at Sydney's Maroubra Beach.

She tried to get me embarrassed to get rid of that nervousness.\"\nLee has had a cameo playing himself in the Bollywood film Victory , shot many commercials and appeared regularly on TV as a cricket commentator, but the 38-year-old found acting \"very challenging\" even after a crash course before shooting.\nAs he talks about the role in his agent's office in North Sydney, fresh from a gym session, Lee gives a rare insight into a how a top sportsman keeps his emotions in control.\n\"I've always said that in life, with sport, I do what I call this emotional wave,\" he says. \"So you imagine a band as wide as this [he measures the width of his mobile phone with his fingers] and the waves going like that [oscillating between the phone's edges]. \n\"That's when you've won the World Cup at the top of the wave. The bottom is when you've been dropped or you've got issues personally in life away from sport.\n\"I try to keep my gap small so that when I'm winning a World Cup, yes, I'm excited and I'm happy and I'm celebrating because you've got to enjoy that moment. But you don't get too far ahead of yourself. You don't go, 'I'm the best in the world, I'm a world champion, I'm the quickest bowler.' You never do that.\n\"And when you're down, you not like, 'I'm the worst in the world, I've been dropped, I'll never get back in.' My whole life, I try to keep that emotional wave really tight.\"\nActing changed all that. Lee flips open the cover to expose the phone inside.\n\"All of a sudden I've got to let go of that,\" he says. \"I've got to bring the world in to know what Will's heart is like.\"\nWhile his marketability was a factor, director Anupam Sharma says he cast Lee because he was playing a character close to himself – a good-looking, down-to-earth Australian with an interest in India.\n\"Brett's character likes welcoming migrants in a genuine way,\" Sharma says. \"He believes that when new migrants talk to people on the street in their language, it's better assimilation for them.\"\nWhen he agreed to the film, Lee had many looks that suggested he was mad for taking on a lead role first time up. Subtle questioning about whether he could even act. \n\"You had a lot of people that said, 'Why would you do a movie?' or 'Are you sure you want to do the lead role? Why not try a smaller role first and just dip your toe in the water?'\n\"But I don't like negative people around me. I'm not like that.\"\nNow that  UnIndian  is opening in cinemas, Lee is ready for all reactions to his performance.\n\"If people come out and say they didn't enjoy the movie or I was crazy for doing it – and I hope not – the best thing is I've done it,\" he says. \"I'm proud of what I've done. And I think the movie has come up really well.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:12:12.143+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
