Picture: BRADEN FASTIER Source: News Corp Australia \nCHART-topping Australian outfit The Rubens took a chance on their upcoming (and first) gig in Cairns. \nBand member Elliott Margin told The Cairns Post going to a new territory was “always a gamble.” \n“You don’t know if you have a fan base there at all,” he said. \nTurns out in Cairns they do. The five-piece (pictured) have sold out their Tanks Arts Centre engagement. \nThe concert is part of a larger tour the band have embarked on and comes on the back of their most recent album Hoops . \nMargin said the tour had been going really well. \n“It’s been a while obviously for us off cycle. So we just did a whole bunch of writing and stuff, but no shows,” he said. \n“To be back on the road, it’s a relief because it is, you know, one of the main reasons that we do it — playing live.” \nMargin revealed people had shown their commitment to the band during the tour too. \n“By the first show, people were singing lyrics to songs that haven’t even been released as singles at all,” he said. \n“It’s like they’ve just gone and done their research.” \nThe tour has already taken them to places like Western Australia, Tasmania and South Australia. \nUnsurprisingly, Margin confirmed that touring involved a lot of flying. \nAsked if there was somebody he didn’t want to sit next to when flying, Margin was diplomatically noncommittal. But he revealed guitarist Zaac might not be another passenger’s favourite, saying he could be “jittery”. \n“He’s listening to music and he’ll start drumming on the seat in front,” he said. \n“It’s going to be in time, but it’s going to be keeping you awake.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:39:32.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
