But these results are nothing new according to Allan Pacey, a leading fertility expert and Professor of Andrology at the University of Sheffield.\n\"We have known for some time that men who increase the temperature of their testicles, either through the heat exposure at work or by wearing tight underwear, have poorer semen quality compared to men whose testicles are cooler\".\n\"What has never adequately been shown is whether men can improve things by changing the choice of their underwear, but this study - although quite small - goes some way to suggest that is true.\n\"What we really need to see is whether switching to looser underwear makes their partners get pregnant more often or quicker than they would have done had the men continued to wear tight underwear\".\nVia Telegraph\nMORE: First born children are more intelligent than their younger siblings\nMORE: Science says running can get you as high as smoking weed\nMORE: People who drink black coffee are more likely to be psychopaths", "external_links": ["http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/11938764/Men-should-sleep-naked-at-night-to-improve-sperm.html"], "published": "2015-10-21T19:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:05:46.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
