The game will be streamed live on Yahoo! this Sunday at 9:30 a.m.\nAside from his usual coverage leading up the game, he'll check in daily with some of the sights he's taking in across the pond.\nOct. 21\nThankfully I'm not doing any driving here. I've now been to England or Scotland three times, and I still can't imagine trying to drive on the wrong side of the road. I was on the media bus today for the first hour-long trip out to the Bills practice facility, and I winced at least three or four times thinking we were about to get in a head-on crash. It's so weird.\nThe Bills' hotel is amazing, not that we are allowed to go in. Our on-site media room is in what is called the potting shed. Clueless as to what that means, but I'm pretty sure it was a greenhouse in a former life. Driving in, I noticed the golf course here on the property. It looks great, and it must be because I heard it's hosting the 2016 British Masters. If I could afford it, I'd play, but I can't, so I won't. Going rate right now is about 200 pounds, or $350 bucks. I'm guessing that won't fly on the expense report.\nThis is the golf course on property that will be site of the 2016 British Masters. pic.twitter.com/oHodmdn9es\n— Sal Maiorana (@salmaiorana) October 21, 2015 ROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nRex Ryan admits defensive plan was flawed\nThe Bills hit the practice field in London but there were several notable players missing. Video by Sal Maiorana\n***\nOct. 20\nWell, I'm here. Drove from Buffalo to Toronto Monday night and flew overnight on British Airways direct into Heathrow. Can't sleep on a plane, and didn't. So I wrote a story and watched two movies — Entourage and True Story, plus a couple episodes of Curb Your Enthusiasm. Man, great in-seat entertainment options, yet there was no Wi-Fi on this big ol' plane. Found that a bit odd.\nWhen I arrived in London, it took a full two hours to finally get to the hotel. Half-hour going through customs, during which a couple Bills fans recognized me, which was funny, then off to find my luggage and exchange currency. From there, Heathrow Express to the Paddington Station, then a cab to the Marriott. It was 1 p.m. local time. Sleep. See ya tomorrow.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nSome fans irked Bills game in London won't be televised locally\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nMaiorana: Rex is overthinking Bills' defensive plan\nNot much of a view outside my downtown London hotel.
