Photo: Supplied \n\nMONTEBELLO EMPORIUM \nWhen Edina Monsoon opened a shop full of \"gorgeous, tasteful, stylish, little gorgeous things\" in Absolutely Fabulous , she might have had something like Montebello in mind. This second, larger branch of the homewares and clothing store is the kind of place where you'll walk in looking for a candle and accidentally walk out with a new wardrobe. \"Women really love my shop, it's not really a shop for men,\" says owner Kate Taylor, who sources the luxe pieces with a focus is on all things bright. The sleek space is spilling over with vibrant, graphic colours from labels such as Kate Spade New York, Life With Bird, Moziâ€‹, Jonathan Adler and Megan Park. There's stationery, dresses, jewellery, rugs, lotions and accessories. \"Our ethos is 'everyday luxury', so you can buy a soap or you can buy a $200 cushion.\" Service is breezy and unpretentious, and customers range from their teens to their 80s. It's one of the few independent stores on chain-heavy Burke Road, and brings a touch of glam to the eastern 'burbs. \"We just find the most gorgeous things we can,\" says Taylor. Cheers, sweetie.\nRear, 596 Burke Road, Camberwell, 03 9882 2179.
