After taking the blame for her incarceration, Joe says in a new interview ahead of E!'s special \" The Real Housewives of New Jersey : Teresa Checks In\" that it's hard taking the children to see their mother in prison. \"We sit down and we talk. There's a snack menu and venues or whatever that you buy from and the kids go crazy because it's like one big room there, so they got a little toy room but they get a little antsy, you know, the young ones,\" he said. \"It's kinda hard to talk to her, so the last 15 minutes, I just kinda send them on their way so we could talk for a little bit and just hang out, me and her.\" When it was time to leave, Joe said he had \"a harder time saying goodbye\" than their four children do. \"Watching her stay there. It sucks. But what are you gonna do? It's almost over, thank God,\" he added. Joe explained how he would make up for lost time with Teresa when she's free. \"We'll be spending a lot of time in the bedroom for awhile, that's for sure,\" he said. \"Every night\" until it's time for him to serve his own jail sentence. \"Now I have the kids trained so they all sleep in their bedrooms, so I don't have to worry about the kids sleeping in my bedroom anymore, or mommy sleeping with them anymore. That's all over, that's done with,\" he said. The couple was jailed after found guilty of fraud charges. \"I was to blame, sure,\" Joe previously told Tamron Hall on \" Today \" show. \"I took full responsibility for everything, but they still put her away.\" He added, \"I was supposed to go away, not her. That was part of the plea, or I thought anyway. I don't know what happened in the courtroom that day.\" \"I'm not saying I didn't do anything wrong or illegal, but there were definitely people behind, talking to them and telling them we did this and telling them we did that to bring it to their attention. And you know, being in the public eye didn't help,\" he said. The Bravo reality star recalled the moment they found out about their jail sentences, \"I feel like somebody just snapped my neck. I felt the pain, the chill going down my spine. I couldn't believe it.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com More Joe Giudice News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:34:58.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
