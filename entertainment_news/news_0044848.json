Aside from the main instruments they have to use to play such as the guitar, drums, or keyboard, they also need various accessories so that can produce better sound and music. \nA guitar is one of the music instruments that require a bit of accessories. There are some guitar accessories that you certainly need and there are some optional ones that simply make your life a little easier. Below are the top guitar accessories every novice guitarist should have: \n1. Guitar picks. Also called plectrums, picks come in different thicknesses for various types of use. For beginners, thin to medium-sized guitar picks are recommended since they work best for strumming. The thicker picks (0.73mm to 1.5mm) are mostly used for single notes and lead playing. The thinner ones allow for better flexibility and smoother sounds. Guitar picks are inexpensive, so you can get a couple of varying thickness to be prepared for any occasion. \n2. Guitar strap. A guitar strap is recommended for electric guitars since they are heavier. The strap will allow you to stretch your arms. Straps tend to slip off the guitar peg, so you should also consider adding strap locks if you're going to regularly use a strap. Guitar straps are reasonably priced as well so you can invest in some and use them to further personalize your guitar. \n3. Case. Professional guitar players recommend that you always use a case when traveling around with the guitar and if you have to store it in some place other than on a guitar stand. Soft cased gig bags are light and flexible, and as such, are usually a good choice for electric guitars. However, make sure the bag comes with adequate padding to absorb the little knocks it'll get going in and out of doors and cars. If you have an acoustic guitar, it is recommended you get a hard case unless you are in a very controlled and caring environment and will not need to transport the guitar very much. Although hard cases are bulkier, acoustic guitars are much more delicate than electric guitars and thus can use the additional protection. \n4. A guitar stand. This must-have accessory allows the guitar to be easily accessible which is essential during the learning process. A stand also protects your investment by supporting the base and neck of the guitar so the wood doesn't bow. In addition, by having a designated storage place other than leaning against a wall or a desk, you can avoid damaging your instrument and prevent accidents from happening as well. \n5. Tuner. Finally, a tuner is a useful tool if you don't have very good ear pitch. The electronic version of this guitar accessory is the easiest to use since red and green lights will tell you if your pitch is flat, sharp, or just right.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T15:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:11:03.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
