(AP) — Vermont corrections officials say a woman jailed on an attempted murder charge put feces into the cell of Evi Quaid, wife of actor Randy Quaid.\nOfficials say it happened Sunday at the South Burlington jail.\nMichael Touchette, the department's director of facilities, said Tuesday that the two women had no physical contact and that Quaid was in her cell. He says the other inmate, Veronica Lewis, used a food chute into Quaid's cell.\nThe Quaids were arrested Friday in Vermont as they tried to enter the U.S. from Quebec. They're being held on bail on charges they left the country five years ago after being accused of vandalism in California.\nLewis is charged with shooting a firearms instructor in the face in June. A phone message and email to her public defender weren't immediately returned Tuesday.\nCrime & Justice Society & Culture Randy Quaid Evi Quaid", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:22:51.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
