It's one of those bold and beautiful roles, literally.\" Her 'don' look will be complete with high-heeled shoes and leather jackets. Sharu has been active in the modelling industry for the past nine years though she is an architect by profession. The experience as a ramp model made facing the camera on the first day of the shoot an easy task, she says. \"I recently started anchoring too. While I was a bit tensed facing the arc lights for the movie, things went well,\" she says.\nThe actress also shares that despite being someone who's showered with compliments for her smile, the movie will have her turning a new page. \"Though I have won the title for Miss Beautiful Smile several times in beauty pageants, I don't smile even for a single scene in the movie,\" Sharu beams.\nShe is also excited to share screen space with Suresh Gopi's son, Gokul, in the movie.\n\"Suresh Gopi is one of my all-time favourite heroes and I grew up watching his films. I thought Gokul would be as serious as his dad's movie characters but when I met him I found him to be quick-witted and extremely down-to-earth,\" she says. \"Actually, the entire team of Mudhugavu is supercool. They work hard and party hard.\"\nApart from Gokul, Arthana and Vijay Babu play the other major characters in the film.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T14:31:44.294+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
