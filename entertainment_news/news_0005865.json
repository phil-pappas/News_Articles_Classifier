Photo: Jon Shapley, 34 of 34 Houston street fest celebrates all things East End 1 / 34 Back to Gallery The Navigation Boulevard esplanade that spans four blocks in Houston's historic East End spilled into the streets Saturday during an annual festival that drew about 7,500 people celebrating the neighborhood's culture.\nIn addition to the picnic tables and walkways that make up the esplanade, there was music, food, artists and even a marching band that filled the fenced-off street. The blocks along Navigation are called the \"El Corazon de la Communidad,\" or \"the Heart of the Community,\" said Jose Monterrosa , marketing and communication coordinator for fourth annual East End Street Fest.\n\"Since it opened, it basically transformed this area,\" Monterrosa said of the esplanade. \"That was the reason to have a street fest, something for the community they can feel proud about ... and bring the attention of people that are living outside the East End area,\" he said.\nThe East End, with its lower cost of living and proximity to downtown, is becoming increasingly popular as rent and home prices rise in other neighborhoods inside the loop.\nAnd this year's fest reflects the influx of residents and business owners who have capitalized on the trend.\nEverything from the patron saint of Mexican food in Houston, the Original Ninfa's that sits on the edge of the street, to Finca Tres Robles, Houston's first private farm inside the 610 Loop, was represented.\nThe farm owners, who sell organic fruits, vegetables and herbs at their location near Turkey Bend off Navigation, displayed in their booth pictures of outdoor twilight dinners on rustic tables and colorful vegetables piled high in farm baskets.\nDaniel Garcia-Prats , co-founder with brother Thomas Garcia-Prats , grew up in Houston and is concerned about the lack of fresh, organic fruits and vegetables available to residents.\nHe says they have customers who drive from Pasadena and tell them that the farm is the closest place for them to find organic produce.\n\"We want to make it something we show is feasible and important and should be included in our city,\" said Daniel Garcia-Prats. \"There's a large Latino population, and the older people have this connection. They grew up farming or their father had a farm, and when they come see it they get really excited because their kids, a lot of times, don't have that connection anymore.\"\nBut there was another attraction deeply rooted in Latino heritage: Danza Azteca Taxcayolotl. Taxcayolotl is made up of individuals of Mexican or Mexican-American lineage who wear traditional Aztec costumes with large, bright feathered headdresses and perform traditional dance to the beat of various drums.\nThey can be found nearly every Sunday at Eastwood Park off Harrisburg performing for the neighborhood kids and parents.\nJavier Herrera , who lives in the East End area and is a member of Taxcayolotl and has been practicing the tradition ever since he was introduced to the dance - over a decade ago - by a professor at the community college he attended in Corpus Christi, says the dances originate from Mexico City during the pre-Columbian Aztec period. It was a way for his people to pass knowledge - of the \"sacred fire\" that kept them alive, knowledge of the seasons for harvests and love, friendship and spirit - to the next generation.\nDuring the Spanish conquests, the dances were forbidden, but families kept teaching their children in secret.\nAbout three centuries later, the restrictions of the Spanish were lifted, says Herrera, and the dances came back into popular Mexican culture.\n\"It helps us to maintain that culture, by keeping these traditions alive,\" he said.\nThe dance troupe garnered a following among the crowd. As they wound through the esplanade, traversing the Mexican and South American food stands, artist booths and even a local youth martial arts team, crowds of adults and children followed, anticipating more drum beats and rhythmic stomping.\nFrancisco and Denise Campos , who have lived in the East End for three years, and their two sons, 6-year-old Alejandro and 9-year-old Desmond, attended the festival Saturday for the second year.\nFrancisco Campos grew up in the area and came back as soon as he could after college.\n\"We see friends and neighbors here, it's a great way to spend an afternoon. It's a great community,\" he said.", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807641/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807659/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807648/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/53/8809207/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807657/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807657/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807673/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807640/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807642/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807660/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807635/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807673/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807639/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/53/8809207/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807659/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807664/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807654/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807651/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807643/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807637/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807655/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807636/6/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807661/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807662/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807645/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807655/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807649/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807656/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807648/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807654/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807661/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807635/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807664/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807663/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807653/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807644/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807650/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807643/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807639/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807646/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807642/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807638/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807638/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807672/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807653/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807674/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807645/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807650/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807658/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807641/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807637/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807636/6/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807644/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807674/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807662/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807651/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807663/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807656/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807671/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807672/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807646/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807658/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807671/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807649/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807660/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/23/8807640/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T16:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:37:06.905+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
