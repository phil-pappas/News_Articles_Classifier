(Algerina Perna / Baltimore Sun) Chris Kaltenbach Contact Reporter The Baltimore Sun \"I felt I had another race to run,\" says Tom Rothman of his return to studio executive work. \nHeading a major Hollywood movie studio is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Unless you're Tom Rothman. Then, it's a twice-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and counting. \nThe Baltimore-born Rothman, who spent 12 years as head of 20th Century Fox before being pushed out in September 2012 (his actual title was chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment), was named this past February to head Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group. Which means that, in a film-business career that stretches back to the 1980s, Rothman has sat in the chairs once occupied by 20th Century Fox founder Darryl F. Zanuck and Harry Cohn, the founder of Columbia (which was purchased by Sony in 1989). He even gets to work out of the same Culver City, Calif., office that fabled MGM chief Louis B. Mayer long inhabited. \nRothman knows he's one of the lucky ones. \"I spent a good part of my career sitting in Darryl Zanuck's old office, and now I sit in Louis B. Mayer's old office,\" he says. \"That's a big responsibility. â€¦ There are only six historic studios, and I will have run two of them.\" \nThe 60-year-old Rothman, back in his hometown recently for a Maryland Film Festival benefit screening of Sony's \"The Walk,\" opening Oct. 9, maintains he had no idea the Fox hierarchy was going to let him go three years ago. (Technically, he resigned in advance of being fired). The studio under his leadership was plenty profitable, and he was hard at work on a new slate of films. Movies made under his watch included such popular and critical favorites as \"Avatar,\"\"Slumdog Millionaire,\"\"Life of Pi\" and the \"X-Men\" franchise. \n\"I was caught unawares, I had no clue,\" he says. \"Nobody in the business had any clue, because we were the most successful studio. I'd never had a (losing) quarter, and we'd just completed a year with the highest operating profits in the business.\" Philippe Petit Talks 'The Walk' CBS2's Jessica Schneider reports. See more videos \nIndustry scuttlebutt had Rothman being let go for several reasons, including his resistance to a deal between Fox and DreamWorks Animation (the deal was announced a month before his departure) and rumors that he was seeking a top job at Universal (he says the talks \"were never as serious as some might say\"). \nRothman admits to enduring \"a hard couple of months\" following his departure from Fox. But as time passed, two things became clear, he says. One, he was not ready to retire; \"that is the one thought that would truly strike terror in my heart,\" Rothman says. And two, he was far from ready to abandon a career in the movies. \"I felt I had another race to run,\" is how he puts it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:02:02.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
