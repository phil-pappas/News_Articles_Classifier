Edsel is a Dallas-based author who wrote \"The Monuments Men,\" which was made into a 2014 movie starring George Clooney. \nHe told The Dallas Morning News ( http://bit.ly/1RnyDJ5 ) on Tuesday that the foundation will stop operating at the end of October. \nEdsel says documenting and sharing the group's stories has cost more than $7 million over 10 years. The foundation raised half. Edsel, who made his money in oil and gas, paid the rest. \nThe 345 treasure hunters will be honored with a Congressional Gold Medal Thursday in Washington, D.C. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T18:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:15:42.833+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
