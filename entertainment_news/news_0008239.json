Believe it or not, bowling is huge at the Life Care Center, and staff as well as the residents are all about knocking down those pins. \n“We like to bring them out to just have fun and enjoy the day and time with each other,” Toby Stigdon, Activity Director for Life Care Center of the Willows said. “They can experience the world, get a change of scenery, and just have fun.” \nSome of the residents are wheelchair bound, and you may wonder how they are able to roll that heavy ball down the lane. Inman’s has some really neat contraptions called wheelchair bowling ball ramps. They look like slides, which is essentially what they are. \nA person places the ramp in front of the lane and positions it how they want it, depending on the location of the still-upright pins. Then they place the ball at the top of the ramp and give it a push. Physics does the rest. The ball rolls down the ramp, down the lane, and into the pins. It’s that simple. \nIt’s something you don’t think about, bowling being wheelchair accessible, but now you know and you are that much better for it. And it gives those who must use wheelchairs the chance to participate in a fun sport. \nThe residents of Life Care Center of the Willows had a great time at Inman’s as well as on their other outings. Be on the lookout for the lively bunch while you’re out and about next time.
