The Eagles, Class A state semifinalists in 2014, were 1-3 more than halfway through the season. And their final three games were against Wilson, Canandaigua and Greece Athena, playoff-bound teams.\nTy'Sean Sizer and Shawn Jones were among the Irondequoit juniors who showed it would be OK for the team to diversify its offense. There also was the experience of Irondequoit's rebound from an 0-3 start last season to draw from.\nSo Irondequoit (4-3) is on a three-game win streak before its Section V Class A tournament quarterfinal at Greece Athena, 2:30 p.m. Saturday.\n\"You can't win all the games the next Monday or Tuesday,'' Irondequoit coach Dan Fichter said. \"You can make the change over the course of weeks.\n\"To be honest, it wasn't that bad. We've got a good football team, and the kids know that.''\nThere are a few good – or evenly-matched, if you choose – teams in the Class A tournament. Here are five things to watch or know when the playoffs begin Friday night.\nSchedule: Section V football playoffs\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nFinal high school football coaches' rankings\n1. The seeds may be buried : Brockport (6-1) and Canandaigua (5-2), the No. 1 and No. 2 seeds, lost regular-season finales to lower seeds in the Class A tournament. No. 6 Irondequoit is the hottest team in the field. And the regular season went like this for No. 5 East Irondequoit Eastridge: two wins, loss, win, two losses and a win.\n2. Does No. 1 Brockport get out of the first round? : Common sense says yes, but a few of the coaches in the field would be less than shocked to see things occur in the tournament that don't make sense.\nDoes Brockport (6-1) bounce back from the shock of its first loss, 21-12 to No. 3 Athena, against No. 8 Wilson (3-4)? Wilson's share of the Rochester City Athletic Conference title may not impress outside the league, but the Wildcats and one or two of their coaches believe the team had a chance to defeat Brockport last year in this round. The rematch of the Blue Devils' 17-6 win is back at Brockport, 7 p.m. Friday.\n3. How long can Spencerport wing it? It's old, bruising and can be somewhat confusing. Spencerport's double wing offense goes against how football is being played today, where teams try to spread out defenses. That is why it can be a tough offense, including plays with double handoffs, to prepare for in a week.\n4. Another rematch : No. 5 Eastridge went to No. 4 Greece Arcadia in Week 3 and the Lancers' 36-3 loss was included on a list of shocking results that weekend. We may see how much motivation counts for the Lancers, who scored 49 points during a lopsided win in Week 7.\n5. When Athena is hot, its hot. When it's not : The point totals for the Greece Athena Trojans with junior Tavon Granison at quarterback in wins, including two playoff-bound opponents: 40, 34, 41, 14 and 21.\nThe not-so-magic number is 14 in Athena's losses to Canandaigua and Irondequoit,\nJAMESJ@GANNETT.COM\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nTop seeds have tall task in Section V playoffs", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7857a09d382814608f07d1be7244b13ba55424d5/c=0-0-2020-2020/local/-/media/2015/10/10/Rochester/Rochester/635801151619140861-ROC-1010-HS-FB-ROUNDUP-E-1-.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fcd1321d819052bcac19fcc994a499a05d7c5033/c=285-0-3495-3210/local/-/media/2015/10/16/Rochester/Rochester/635806155726957152-2015-Victor-football---Jamie-Trimboli.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T04:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:04:10.422+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
