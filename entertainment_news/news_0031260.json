Here are the top 10. \n:: Name: Jaws, played by Richard Kiel. \nFilm: The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker. \nNotable characteristic: A 7' 2\" hulk with steel teeth that could bite through anything. \n007 fate: Unwisely turned into more of a comic character in his second outing, Jaws changed allegiance and settled down with a girlfriend. \n: : Name: Dr No, played by Joseph Wiseman. \nFilm: Dr No. \nNotable characteristic: His bionic metal hands. Dr No could crush a stone into powder. \n007 fate: Boiled alive in a radioactive coolant after trying to kill Bond. \n:: Name: Auric Goldfinger, played by German actor Gert Frobe and voiced by Michael Collins. \nFilm: Goldfinger. \nNotable characteristic: A rotund, greedy gold smuggler with really bad taste in clothes. \n007 fate: Shot in the heart when Bond took him by surprise. \n:: Name: Nick Nack, played by Herve Villechaize. \nFilm: The Man with Golden Gun. \nNotable characteristic: Scaramanga's butler and sidekick was only 3' 11\". Nick Nack is said to be the inspiration behind Mini-Me, played by Verne Troyer in the Austin Powers films. \n007 fate: Nick Nack tried to kill Bond, but after a brief fight, 007 stuffed him into a suitcase and locked him away in a cage. \n:: Name: Red Grant, played by Robert Shaw. \nFilm: From Russia With Love. \nNotable characteristic: Like Bond, he was a tough, psychopathic killer. Unlike Bond, he worked for SPECTRE. \n007 fate: After a long, brutal fight on a train, Bond pulled a knife out of his briefcase and stabbed Grant before taking the villain's garrote wire watch and strangling him to death. \n:: Name: Rosa Klebb, played by Lotte Lenya. \nFilm: From Russia with Love. \nNotable characteristic: Also known as Number 3, Klebb was a high-ranking, sadistic member of SPECTRE who loved torture interrogations. \n007 fate: Klebb attempted to kick Bond with a poison-tipped shoe, but he blocked the attack. Her former protegee Tatiana Romanova (played by Daniela Bianchi) picked up Bond's gun and killed Klebb. \n:: Name: Oddjob, played by Harold Sakata. \nFilm: Goldfinger. \nNotable characteristic: Oddjob was extremely strong; he broke the railing of a staircase with karate chops. But it is Oddjob's bowler hat that continues to enthrall James Bond fans – it was edged with razors and put to lethal use. \n007 fate: Bond used Oddjob's hat against him. He grabbed a sparking wire and thrust it against some bars where the hat was lodged. This sent electric current to the metal in the hat's rim and electrocuted the henchman. \n:: Name: Xenia Onatopp, played by Famke Janssen. \nFilm: GoldenEye. \nNotable characteristic: She killed men by squeezing them to death between her thighs. \n007 fate: Onatopp attempted to dispose of Bond via her signature method, but he attached her to a safety harness and shot down a helicopter, which sent her flying into a tree where she was crushed to death. Bond quipped: \"She always did enjoy a good squeeze.\" \n:: Name: Raul Silva, played by Javier Bardem. \nFilm: Skyfall. \nNotable characteristic: Former MI6 operative who was captured, tortured and attempted to take his own life using a hydrogen cyanide implant in one of his molars. The suicide attempt failed, leaving him with mental scars and a horribly disfigured face. \n007 fate: Bond hurled a knife into his back. \n:: Name: Ernst Blofeld, played by Donald Pleasence, Telly Savalas, Charles Gray, John Hollis and Max von Sydow. \nFilm: From Russia with Love, Thunderball, You Only Live Twice, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Diamonds Are Forever, For Your Eyes Only, Never Say Never Again (Sean Connery's non-Eon produced return to the Bond role). \nNotable characteristic: Also known as Number 1, the head of global criminal organisation SPECTRE. Blofeld has varied in appearance, but Pleasence's bald, evil genius with the facial scar, fondness for stroking a white cat and aspirations of world domination is recognised as the definitive portrayal. \n007 fate: Bond dropped Blofeld down a chimney stack to his death in For Your Eyes Only. \nThe Top 13 Bond Girl moments \nItalian beauty Monica Bellucci and French star Lea Seydoux follow in the high-heeled footsteps of Eva Green, Honor Blackman and Olga Kurylenko as Bond girls in latest instalment Spectre. \nHere are 13 of the best Bond girl moments of all time. \n1. Honey Ryder in that bikini – Dr No. \nIn the famous scene, later recreated by Halle Berry in Tomorrow Never Dies, Ursula Andress emerges out of the sea in a white bikini. It's hard to beat this scene, and to this day white bikinis continue to sell well. \n2. Pussy Galore's roll around in the hay – Goldfinger. \nGalore, played by Honor Blackman, almost resisted Sean Connery's Bond charms, but finally succumbed after a playful fight in the hay. \n3. Miranda Frost and Jinx's catfight – Die Another Day. \nA sword fight in mid-air is different. Rosamund Pike's Frost takes on Halle Berry's Jinx, while dressed in a cut-out cropped number and white trousers. The X-Men star displayed some impressive gymnastics. \n4. Tracy Bond's death – On Her Majesty's Secret Service. \nJames Bond has only been married once, and his wife Tracy's death, just after they tied the knot, hit him hard. Tracy (Diana Rigg) was killed by a single shot by the agent's nemesis Blofeld, leaving Bond (George Lazenby) distraught. \n5. Jill Masterson covered in gold – Goldfinger. \nIt's a tough gig being a Bond girl. Shirley Eaton, as Masterson, had to endure being painted gold while naked for Sean Connery's third outing as the spy. \n6. Vesper Lynd takes on Bond – Casino Royale. \nA Bond girl as witty as Bond himself? No wonder Daniel Craig's Bond fell in love with the sultry French woman played by Eva Green, who was far from mere eye candy. \n7. Wai Lin and Bond in that motorcycle chase – Tomorrow Never Dies. \nAs played by Michelle Yeoh, this Bond girl proved she can take care of herself when she and Pierce Brosnan's Bond escaped from Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce). And her kill count looks pretty impressive too. \n8. May Day – A View To A Kill. \nModel-singer Grace Jones was not one to be messed with as the lover of villain Max Zorin (Christopher Walken) and his chief henchwoman. She also possessed superhuman strength when she faced off against Sir Roger Moore's Bond. \n9. Paris Carver's death – Tomorrow Never Dies. \nSadly for Teri Hatcher, her Bond girl didn't live to see tomorrow – she was killed after a reunion with Pierce Brosnan's Bond. But she made an impact in that bedroom scene. \n10. Jinx's orange bikini – Die Another Day. \nPaying homage to Ursula Andress's white bikini scene, Oscar-winning actress Halle Berry relived the moment in a bright orange number. \n11. Xenia Onatopp's crushing moves – GoldenEye. \nOnatopp (Famke Janssen) was a worthy opponent for Pierce Brosnan's Bond, with her crushing moves no match for many enemies. Her MO? She squeezed her rivals to death between her strong thighs. \n12. Elektra King tortures Bond – The World Is Not Enough. \nAs played by French actress Sophie Marceau, all is not what it seemed with the beautiful Ms King. Intent on revenge, she captured 007 and strapped him into an old garrotte device which was designed to slowly break his neck. Then she attempted to seduce him once more, but when called to do his duty, Bond didn't hesitate: he shot her dead. \n13. Speed demon Fiona Volpe – Thunderball. \nTough and resourceful, Volpe, played by Italian actress Luciana Paluzzi, worked for Spectre in this 1965 film. Not many women can unsettle James Bond, but this operative managed it when she picked him up in her Ford Mustang convertible and gave him a fright with the speed of her driving. \nWhat's more, she looked ever so cool in motorbike leather while riding a BSA Lightning sport bike, which was equipped with a deadly rocket. \nThe best Bond cars \nA good Bond film is an intoxicating cocktail of intrigue, explosions, lunatic baddies and beautiful women. \nBut the most important ingredient in this heady mix is the car – whether supplied by Q or commandeered by 007 himself, Bond's wheels never fail to set the heart racing. Apart from the one with the 2CV, obviously. \nHere are the 10 most important Bond cars, their best gadget, and how much we secretly all want one. \n:: Lotus Esprit – The Spy Who Loved Me \nThe Lotus Esprit S1 is a peculiar, wedge-shaped car, which launched in 1976. In the film we see it convert into a submarine and dive into the sea, which is actually slightly more believable than its apparent ability to outrun a helicopter – with just 160bhp at its disposal, the Esprit was considered underpowered at the time. \nBest gadget: Submersible qualities helpful during wet winters and short trips abroad. \nDesirability factor: 6 /10 – looks the part, but just isn't fast enough. \n:: BMW Z3 – Goldeneye \nAs James May once put it: \"James Bond driving a BMW is like Douglas Bader flying for the Luftwaffe.\" Q might have been forgiven if it was a classic, but unfortunately it was a lowly Z3 – another Bond car renowned in the real world for its lacklustre performance. Its mercifully short screen time of around two minutes was notable purely because the car didn't get blown up at any point. Shame. \nBest gadget: Radar scanner and 'stinger' missiles amount to a weaponised TomTom. \nDesirability factor: Virtually nil. \n:: Citroen 2CV – For Your Eyes Only \nBond's slapstick escape from the baddies in this little yellow 2CV is one of the greatest pieces of cinematic nonsense on this list. Roger Moore's Lotus Esprit had already blown itself up by this point in the film, forcing our hero to rely on a commandeered Citroen – as much a stab at British engineering as it was on Bond's reliance on gadgetry, we suspect. \nBest gadget: Yellow paint is well known for enhancing residual values. \nDesirability factor: Still better than a Z3. \n:: (Flying) AMC Matador – The Man With the Golden Gun \nIt seemed like there were more AMC cars than people in this Bond film, with the goodies, the baddies and the cops all tearing around in cars from the now-defunct manufacturer. The one that sticks in the memory is Scaramanga's aerodynamically-unlikely Matador Coupe car-plane. Resplendent in a sort of brown-beige, this spectacular flying machine flew Britt Ekland \"200 miles west of Bangkok\", though we'd much rather fly the remote-controlled scale model used in the film. \nBest gadget: You get to have a flying car, but the catch? It's brown. \nDesirability factor: 8 /10 for purely practical reasons. \n:: Aston Martin DB5 – Goldfinger \nThe DB5 had all the bells and whistles expected from 007's chariot, and stands the test of time as a result – the caltrop dispensers, smoke screen, an ejector seat and rotating number plates are all immensely desirable accessories to anyone used to driving in Britain today. This is probably the ultimate Bond car. \nBest gadget: Rotating number plates make your car exempt from congestion charge. \nDesirability factor: 9 /10. \n:: Aston Martin V8 – The Living Daylights \nThe captivating roar of this car was probably the most rousing score of any Bond film. Ageing, British and brutish, the Aston Martin V8 was heralded as \"Britain's first supercar\" on account of its 170mph top speed and its ability to beat the Ferrari Daytona to 60mph. It's also a muscular, masculine car – in contrast with Bond's later succession of wimpish BMWs. \nBest gadget: Rocket boost wouldn't go amiss on the M6 Toll. \nDesirability factor: 10 /10. \n:: Aston Martin Vanquish – Die Another Day \nIf the ability to turn your car invisible at the flick of a switch appeals, then the Aston Martin \"Vanish\" could be the Bond car for you. Criticised in the real world for having rather substandard levels of interior trim for an Aston, the V12 in Die Another Day had enough armaments to fend off a similarly well-equipped Jag. \nBest gadget: Imagine having an invisible car. \nDesirability factor: 5 /10 imagine trying to find your invisible car. \n:: Toyota 2000GT – You Only Live Twice \nThe Toyota 2000GT is one of the most beautiful models ever made by the Japanese manufacturer, and was responsible for a change in attitudes towards non-European sports cars. Monocles fell out, and sherry was spluttered indignantly across billiard rooms. But Bond's lady friend Aki went one step further with a special convertible edition, made just for the films. Vanilla 2000GTs sell for crazy money, more than their European contemporaries, and Daniel Craig himself says it's his favourite Bond car. We're inclined to agree. \nBest gadget: British roadster looks with Japanese hatchback reliability – who needs rocket boosters? \nDesirability factor: 9 /10 \n:: Aston Martin DB10 – Spectre \nThe most exclusive Bond car of this list, the Aston Martin DB10 was only ever built for filming. Just ten examples were hand built in Gaydon, Aston Martin's HQ, so don't expect to see many on the road. But expect to see some more of those distinctive aesthetics in Aston Martin models to come – the DB10 showcases a new design language for the manufacturer. All we know for sure is that the new car will be called the DB something. \nBest gadget: A little early to tell! \nDesirability factor: Certainly wouldn't turn one down. \n:: Sunbeam Alpine – Dr No \nBond's first ever car was a rather budget choice. The Sunbeam Alpine had just 80bhp at its disposal, making it a wheezy option for the Jamaican countryside. It didn't even have any gadgets. What it did, though, was start a glorious tradition of Bond cars – one that has entertained fans for over half a century. \nBest gadget: Not applicable. \nDesirability factor: You can pick up a fairly tidy example on eBay for less than a Fiesta.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T10:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:25:40.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
