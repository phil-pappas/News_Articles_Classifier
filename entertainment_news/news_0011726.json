Titled “Payag,” the song, Gloc-9 explained, is rooted in the “debt of gratitude” culture in the Philippines. \n“When one gives a poor family a kilo of rice, for instance, they will easily consider it a debt of gratitude—not knowing that what they were truly meant to get were 10 sacks,” Gloc-9, or Aristotle Pollisco in real life, explained. \nAnd then of course there’s his 2010 hit song “Upuan,” which urges those in power to try and walk in the shoes of the ordinary folk. This one, on the other hand, was inspired by his experiences as a nurse in various public hospitals, seeing people lose their loved ones and people so poor they couldn’t even afford record cards, which sell for P5 each. \n“Some of my songs like ‘Upuan’ are ‘in season.’ Some of my works are like Christmas songs,” he jested. \nNow in his 18th year in show biz, Gloc-9 said he would like to continue crafting socially-relevant tunes. “I’m happy and I’m grateful… I want to maintain a clear path and direction for my career,” he said. \nThe ongoing “Ang Kwento ng Makata” series at the Music Museum this month is dedicated to his loyal fans. \n\nApproachable \n“Like what I always say, I’m just a music fan. And I don’t want my fans to ever feel that I’m no longer approachable, that they can’t laugh with me or give me high fives,” said the rapper, who admitted to being nervous about his shows. \n“I don’t want to expect or assume that I’ll pack each one. But I’m hoping for the best,” he said. \nGloc-9 will be joined by a different set of guests for each night. Aiza Seguerra, Bamboo, Jay Durias, Jennylyn Mercado, Kylie Padilla and Marc Abaya were his guests last Saturday. \nChito Miranda, Ebe Dancel, Janno Gibbs, Jonalyn Viray and Rico Blanco will join him on the 17th. \nDancel, Jolina Magdangal, Ogie Alcasid, Regine Velasquez and Yeng Constantino will join him on the 24th. \nDancel, Durias, Julie Anne San Jose and KZ Tandingan are scheduled for the 31st. Meanwhile, guest performers appearing in all four dates are Maya, Reese, Migz Haleco and Rochelle Pangilinan. \nFor “Ang Kwento ng Makata” tickets, call TicketWorld at 8919999 or Music Museum at 7210635 and 7216726. \n(apolicarpio@inquirer.com.ph)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:05:07.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
