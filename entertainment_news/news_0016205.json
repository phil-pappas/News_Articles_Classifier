I'm happy to say director Kenneth Branagh's take on \"Cinderella\" is delightfully old-fashioned, sincere and simply enchanting to watch. Some might see those qualities as boring, but I personally found this movie refreshing, and best of all, loved its message for young audiences — that above all, one should \"have courage and be kind.\" With bullying so prevalent now, it's an important theme to convey. And don't worry that your kids won't pick up on that message. It's verbalized throughout the movie at least five or six times, and I'm not even kidding. This one releases on DVD and Blu-ray Sept. 15. \nWatch it or skip it: Watch it \nWhat's good: This movie is as wholesome as its modest heroine. There's zero profanity, no snark, not a single double entendre that I picked up on, no trace of potty humor and absolutely no sex. \nWhat's bad: The special effects are at times quite amazing and at other times very, very bad. \n*** \nRated G \nBest for all ages \nThis documentary from the Disneynature series is narrated by comedian and actress Tina Fey and follows the adventures of a clan of macaque monkeys living in the jungle near some picturesque abandoned temples in Sri Lanka. As Fey explains early in the film, Maya is the heroine of this story — a female monkey who's low-ranking in the macaque's social structure, excluded from access to the best food, best shelter and even to interested suitors. When a \"hunky monkey\" named Kumar shows up and shows interest in her, Maya ends up pregnant with Kip. Unfortunately, Kumar is chased off by the alpha macaque, Raja, and Maya is forced to raise Kip alone in some grueling conditions. Like most single parents, Maya rises to the challenge, devoted to her child and willing to do whatever it takes to make a better life for the young monkey. \nI've seen most of the Disneynature movies, and I personally think \"Monkey Kingdom\" is the funniest, most endearing and most entertaining one so far. There's no doubting \"Monkey Kingdom\" is a documentary for families, about a family — albeit a furry, tree-swinging one — and is 81 minutes every member of the family will enjoy watching. \nWatch it or skip it: Watch it \nWhat's good: Kids will love seeing the monkeys interact with one another. \nWhat's bad: There is some minor violence when a rival tribe of monkeys challenge the group of monkeys being featured, and some animals die in the clash. \n*** \nRated PG-13 \nBest for ages 13 and older \nIn this faith-based movie, Calvin Campbell (Kristopher Polaha) is a former professional baseball player who struggles with a drinking problem and single parenting a teenage daughter. One day during a visit to the grocery store, Calvin meets Produce (David DeSanctis), a young man with Down syndrome who always has a smile for everyone he meets. Drawn to Produce's unwavering optimism, Calvin begins spending more time with the young man, who shows him that the biggest handicap in life is often a bad attitude. \nThis movie deals with a lot of heavy issues, including alcoholism, attempted date rape and society's view of the mentally disabled, which makes it inappropriate for younger kids. On the other hand, it promotes some excellent messages of sacrifice, perseverance and love that older children can benefit from. The best thing about this movie is Produce, played by a young actor with Down syndrome who delivers a strong performance. His character leads Calvin to overcome his drinking problem, repair his relationship with his daughter and regain his confidence. Good acting and production value also make it worth watching. \nWatch it or skip it: Watch it \nWhat's good: It's a good way for families to discuss the topic of Down syndrome. \nWhat's bad: There is some mild profanity and strong themes. 10 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://grnol.co/1EzryUL TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T23:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:30:53.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
