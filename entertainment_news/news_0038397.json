Copyright protects only the expression of this idea - the words and pictures used to describe the sequence - and not the idea of the sequence itself.\"\nPersonal wealth\nIn simple terms, this means 69-year-old Bikram has copyright over his books and DVDs and other expressions of his work, but not the exercise itself.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:07:25.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
