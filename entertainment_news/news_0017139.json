Here are some of its hits and misses:\nBig-screen televisions and video conferencing: Yes\nThe film features several scenes of characters watching screens very much like the oversize ones we actually use these days. That's saying something, because most TVs of the 1980s were heavy, square appliances with bulky picture tubes. Some of them even came in wood-grain cabinets like furniture!\nWelcome, 'Back to the Future' Day\nRead More Also, the \"BTTF II\" characters talk to the screens just like we do today. Not bad, given that videophones -- though long promised -- barely existed in 1989.\nHoverboard: No\nDespite the recent Lexus commercial showing skateboard aces skimming around a skatepark on maglev hoverboards, the technology just isn't there yet. The Lexus hoverboard requires a special surface to ride on, as does a rival, the Hendo.\nAnother hoverboard, the Omni, is essentially a skateboard with helicopter rotors. Sorry, we'll just have to wait a little longer before flying around Hill Valley is commonplace.\nFashion: Mixed\nThe less said about the custom of wearing two ties at the same time , the better. However, the movie did get the concept of everyday athletic apparel right.\nEveryday consumer products: Yes, with an asterisk\nPepsi is still around, and the beverage company wasn't going to miss a chance to put out a limited-edition Pepsi Perfect like the one Marty orders in the film. But the key words are \"limited edition.\" Similarly, in reality, \"Jaws\" only made it to \"Jaws: The Revenge\" (the fourth film in the series), but that didn't stop Universal from putting out a fake trailer for \"BTTF II's\" \"Jaws 19.\"\nBut there's a Pizza Hut in town, and the McFly family is shown chowing down on a pie. Some things never go out of style.\nVideo glasses: Yes\nMarty McFly's troublesome kids wear high-tech goggles to the dinner table, which are remarkably similar in function to Google Glass, Oculus Rift and Samsung VR.\nThe World Champion Chicago Cubs: ?\nSome futures just aren't knowable ... yet .", "external_links": ["http://www.cnet.com/news/the-lexus-hoverboard-is-real-video/", "http://curtismathes.webs.com/cm%201980bb.jpg", "http://backtothefuture.wikia.com/wiki/Multiple_ties"], "published": "2015-10-21T01:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:47:26.555+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
