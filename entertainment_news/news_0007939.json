He was 66.\nThompson's musical career spans more than 40 years, but the Richmond, Va. resident slowed down his touring in recent years. He said on his website that his concert schedule was limited to shows he knows \"will be enjoyable.\"\nIn September, Thompson took to his Facebook page to publicly announce his long battle with cancer.\n\"I apologize for being out of touch for a while,\" he wrote. \"Many of you know that I've been battling cancer for over 15 years. These days, it's causing a few problems but I'm dealing with it and will be back performing soon.
