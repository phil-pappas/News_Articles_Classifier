Juliette's tour mate, Luke Wheeler, gave her a cautionary tale about abandoning his wife and kids for life as a country star. It didn't seem to work, though. Juliette was downing champagne with a friend right after that pep talk. \nWill Lexington faced heat from some gay members of the Nashville music community for not doing more with his status as an out country singer. Will's boyfriend, songwriter Kevin Bicks, backed them up but understood when Will said he needed more time to adjust to being an out gay man. \nMayor Teddy Conrad came clean to his daughters, Maddie and Daphne, about embezzling money from the government.
