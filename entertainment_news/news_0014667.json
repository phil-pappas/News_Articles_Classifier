At 10 years old, we have to do more.”\nAlso today, Step Up presented three new annual awards. Winners were:\n• Outstanding Business Champion to International Paper for creatively working to increase opportunity for Savannah/Chatham County residents by creating a sabbatical for Michael O’Neal to direct the Parent University effort for a year.\n• Teinique Gadson Advocacy Award to HUGS –Heads-Up Guidance Services – for counseling and related help as a direct service provider in the community two has gone above and beyond In offering assistance and services to residents in need.\n• Outstanding Neighborhood Leader to – Molly Lieberman and Project Inspire - in a tie for a grassroots or neighborhood-based leader who has worked to create positive change in his/her community.\nDodson, president of Durham, N.C. based MDC and its poverty-alleviation efforts, challenged the local audience to answer whether they believed that where a person starts out in life should not determine where they end up in life?\nBut he said statics show lack of mobility is more centered in the south than in any other part of the country despite fertile sites for business in such places as Charlotte and Atlanta.\n“ ‘Inequality would not be a problem if upward mobility were strong in America,’ “ Dodson said, quoting former labor secretary Robert Reich.\n“We’ve got some real work to do.”\nStatistics show a 70 percent chance that children born to parents at the bottom end of the economic spectrum will not make it too far up the family income ladder.\n“That, I would say in the nicest way, is unacceptable.”\nEducation is a critical key to change, he said.\n“Getting credentials (post-high school degrees) is liberating. … with education we can do something about mobility,” he said.\nIn Chatham County, 53 percent of students from low-income families attend high-poverty schools, while only 13 percent of pupils not from low-income families attend similar schools.\nAlso in Chatham County, 55 percent of black student are in high-poverty schools, with only 11 percent of white students are, he said.\n“Economic diversity in schools has a powerful effect,” he said.\nHe said the local problem mirrors a national trend of “We are re-segregating economically.”\n“There’s a lot more real work to be done,” Dodson said. “It is being done here.”", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-02T09:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:45:35.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
