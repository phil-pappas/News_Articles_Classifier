The North American tour, produced by Live Nation, will kick off in June and include a stop in Louisville, KY on Friday, July 29 at KFC Yum! Center. The two influential entertainers join forces for what will be one of the year’s most anticipated summer music events. FUTURE NOW: THE TOUR will visit over 40 cities throughout the U.S. and Canada including stops in New York City, Los Angeles, Toronto, Montreal, Chicago, Las Vegas, Vancouver and more. \nTickets for the Louisville show will go on sale to the public beginning at 10 a.m. on Saturday, Nov. 7 at www.Livenation.com , www.Ticketmaster.com , the KFC Yum! Center box office and all Ticketmaster outlets. Citi® cardmembers will have access to pre-sale tickets beginning Tuesday, Nov. 3 at 10 a.m. local time through Citi's Private Pass® Program. For complete pre-sale details, visit www.citiprivatepass.com . \nDemi Lovato ’s newest album, CONFIDENT, is out now on Hollywood Records/Island Records/Safehouse Records and features the #1 iTunes smash single “Cool For The Summer.” Lovato kicked off the release of CONFIDENT with powerful and poignant performances on “Saturday Night Live,” which generated the #1 worldwide trending topic on Twitter and massive coverage by the media. Following the performance, the Village Voice declared, “Issue a warrant for Demi Lovato ‘cause girl murdered ‘Saturday Night Live,’” adding, “Lovato’s full-throttle vocal assault on the Studio 8H stage with (“Confident”) could service as a career standout for her.” \nLovato will perform songs from the critically acclaimed new album on “Good Morning America” (Oct. 29) as well as “The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon” (Oct. 30). Critical praise for Lovato’s CONFIDENT has been equally stellar. Billboard Magazine asserted, “Demi Lovato has become one of pop’s leading motivational figures,” while People Magazine lauded, “It’s Lovato’s dynamite vocals and striking vulnerability on aching ballads and gospel anthems that make CONFIDENT such a triumph,” and USA Today avowed, “She inarguably has one of the strongest instruments in pop right now.” \nIsland Records Artist, Nick Jonas introduced himself as a fully formed solo artist on his hit self-titled debut, released in November 2014. The critically-acclaimed album includes double-platinum smash single and #1 U.S. radio hit, “Jealous” and his sultry second chart-climbing radio single, “Chains.” Jonas attributes his album’s darker overtones partially to the fact that while he was recording, he was also shooting the gritty television show ‘Kingdom’ — a mixed martial arts drama that premiered on DirecTV's Audience Network last fall and was recently picked up for two additional seasons. Jonas recently earned two more high-profile roles, a guest starring role in Fox's horror-comedy series, ‘Scream Queens’ and a lead in the James Franco produced film, ‘Goat’. Showing no signs of slowing down this year, the breakout solo powerhouse joined forces with west coast rapper-producer Sage the Gemini to release their summer collaboration, “Good Thing.” Jonas’ latest single, “Levels,” has already amassed over 12 million views on YouTube and is rapidly climbing the Billboard Hot 100 chart. He also recently wrapped up his sold-out North American “LIVE IN CONCERT” tour and has been nominated for a 2015 American Music Award for Favorite Male Artist – Pop/Rock.
