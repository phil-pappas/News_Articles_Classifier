By Nathan Lawrence \nLet’s get this out of the way upfront: the Star Wars Battlefront beta was awesome. Whether stomping the Rebel Alliance on the icy fields of Hoth, capturing loot-laden escape pods on Sullust, or felling scores of terrible-aiming Stormtroopers on Tatooine, it delivered on the promise of being part of the Star Wars universe. But as much as the beta got right, it also raised some issues that DICE needs to address prior to launch next month to ensure that Star Wars Battlefront is the best it can be. Got feedback on our player? We want to hear it. \nHere’s our list of 14 issues that we encountered during the Star Wars Battlefront beta. 1) That’s not the server you’re looking for \nMatchmaking is a fantastic tool which, in theory, means you can be in a game with a couple of button presses. It’s also a feature that’s best served alongside a server browser, particularly when players are connecting to dedicated servers (which they are in Battlefront). Like the Battlefield games DICE made before it, Battlefront is in need of a server browser to offer a manual level of control over the map, mode and favourite place to blast fictional avatars from far, far away. 2) From loathed Imperial to Rebel scum \nAdding a server browser would also make it easier to find and join friends’ servers, instead of being automatically thrown into either a queue or the opposite team to your partner or squad. This latter gripe wouldn’t be so bad if there was the option to switch teams, which needs to be in the final game. Deterring team stacking is important in any shooter, particularly on potentially unbalanced maps, but these can be blocked at a certain point in the map (if one team is clearly dominating the other), or deterred with a good ol’ punch to the points and/or credits belt if it’s abused. On the topic of teams: DICE, please add ping to the scoreboard (even if it’s the cop-out coloured bars that plague shooters these days). Got feedback on our player? We want to hear it. 3) Too accurate for Sand People \nIt takes at least a few rounds to come to grips with the shooting mechanics in Battlefront. Shooting from the hip is just as accurate as aiming down the sights (with the Cycler Rifle being the exception to this rule), and there’s no recoil when spraying. Having to lead your target because of the slower blaster muzzle velocity is all well and good if the hit registry is perfect. We noticed several instances when the animation for a hit would play out on an enemy, and the reticule would light up to indicate a hit, but the damage wasn’t registering… as evidenced by their full health bar in the kill-cam when they spun around and one-shot us. 4) Battling hellspawn \nThere’s been a lot of Bothan internet chatter about the spawn woes in the Battlefront beta, particularly for Walker Assault on Hoth. Aside from spawning on your partner, it appears that there were only a couple of primary spawn zones per side, which meant that spawn camping and spawn deaths were a regular occurrence. There is a couple of seconds of spawn invincibility at play, but there really should be more safe respawn areas. The odd spawn death is part and parcel of any shooter, but if it’s a regular occurrence, it makes for a whole lot of Rebel rage. While we’re on the topic of spawning, it’d be great to have a camera view of the general spawn zones to see what we’re about to spawn into. Spawning into the nondescript icy corridors of Echo Base doesn’t exactly make it easy to know which direction to sprint to get back into the fight. Got feedback on our player? We want to hear it. 5) Run and (hit with your) gun \nMelee is an essential inclusion of any first-person shooter these days, so it’s great to see it represented in Battlefront. What’s not great is that using melee destroys all forward momentum, contrary to the regular expectations of a melee strike in other shooters, which leaves you open to fire or counter-strike. It also destroys the pace of the game, which is odd considering how fast-paced Battlefront is in almost every other area. Running and hitting with the butt of your gun shouldn’t be too much of an ask for Battlefront. 6) Bring balance to the Force (of the arsenal) \nWe can appreciate that we’ve only seen a handful of weapons that will be on offer in the final game, but there are already balancing concerns. For instance, the DLT-19 Heavy Blaster Rifle was the go-to choice for the majority of combatants we encountered, and we certainly put it to devastating use in conjunction with the jetpack. Couple this with the extremely high fire rate, lack of recoil (true of any Battlefront blaster), as well as incredibly fast cooling power, and there’s cause for concern. While we’re at it, 90-ish damage from the Cycler Rifle on the torso is way too high, particularly because it encourages camping behind enemy lines. 7) Rebel vehicles: more, more, more \nWe can appreciate that the Rebel Alliance didn’t have a garage packed with vehicles in the original Star Wars trilogy, but they at least need some options to combat the powerful Imperial walkers. Undoubtedly, the Ion Torpedo card will transition from missions to multiplayer, offering a strong anti-vehicle option to the Rebels on Walker Assault mode, but the Alliance should also have some vehicles of their own, even if they’re repurposed and modified (if only aesthetically) Imperial vehicles to stop the bigger modes from descending into Imperial vehicles versus Rebel infantry. On the topic of vehicles, it’d be great to have first-person perspective for land vehicles and a HUD for the spaceships, too. The iconic roster can only go so far.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T03:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:13:56.287+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
