Author Nabelah Al-Neghaimshi believes that they should enjoy those roles without delinquency, guilt, excessive effort, fake perfection and selfishness. In her new publication, she reveals a book for all tired hearts and stressed and overburdened bodies who are grasping for a few words that would make them appreciate themselves and feel the value of their presence. “ For All ” (published by AuthorHouse UK) is a profound book that features a shortcut to the concepts of balance and moderation in playing life roles within the extent of one’s abilities. Every chapter ends with an affirmation that decreases guilt and increases joy to nurture the genuine humanitarian essence of every individual. Al-Neghaimshi reviewed some of people’s roles in life. Her goal is to invite readers to reflect on their life, identify ways of improving it and find ways to avoid preventable pains. She encourages them to highlight the roles in their lives that deserve to be celebrated rather than living them with painful bitterness because of their ignorance and lack of awareness.\n“We are gradually growing apart from being human beings. We cause ourselves a lot of anxiety, tension, exhaustion, physical illness, sleeping disorders, problems, losses and social conflicts that affect individuals and societies,” Al-Neghaimshi says. “This book will bring us back to our true modest human nature away from selfishness and fake idealism.”\nAn enlightening and thought-provoking read, “For All” inspires readers to envision their lives and boost their sense of worthiness to happiness . They can achieve these through applying and performing within their possible extent, without exaggeration, guilt, selfishness or dereliction.\n“For All”\nBy Nabelah Al-Neghaimshi\nHardcover | 6x9in | 108 pages | ISBN 9781504944588\nSoftcover | 6x9in | 108 pages | ISBN 9781504944595\nE-Book | 108 pages | ISBN 9781504944601\nAvailable at Amazon and Barnes & Noble\nAbout the Author\nNabelah Al-Neghaimshi is a self-development author and speaker from Kuwait.
