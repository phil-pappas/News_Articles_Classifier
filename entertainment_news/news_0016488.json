Mack, a lawyer with the civil rights and civil liberties office.\nHer internal report, intended for ICE Director Sarah Saldana and other officials in the department, was inadvertently sent to lawyers for the two men.\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement officials chose not to follow her recommendation and say they are following department guidelines in deporting the men. They say the two men, Jose Adan Fugon-Cano and Gustavo Barahona Sanchez, both had been removed from the U.S. before, and thus are still priorities for deportation under the department's new guidelines. The men are now being held in the Alexandria Transportation Center in Louisiana, the last stop for many unauthorized immigrants who are flown from the U.S.\nOriginally formed to locate immigrants who had failed to comply with a judge's deportation order, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement program is increasingly being used to find immigrants with criminal convictions who have recently been let out of jail.\nAccording to the lawyers, it also shows that the agency is still using arrests by local police to round up low-level offenders in the country illegally, in spite of a new plan to target only priority cases.\n\"I think at the end of the day they do have targets to meet and they're willing to do whatever it takes to meet those quotas,\" said Julie Mao, a lawyer with the New Orleans Workers' Center for Racial Justice, who represents the two men. \"This is a precise example of an agency with no transparency.\"\nAdan, 36, and Barahona, 29, say they were standing outside a Motel 6 in May waiting for a ride to a construction job when a local policeman in New Llano, La., stopped and asked them for identification. Five men were picked up, but the other three have been released; Adan and Barahona, who is the father of two U.S. citizens, ended up in an immigration cell.\n\"One moment is burned in my memory,\" Adan said in an affidavit. \"When one of (the) police was putting us in the car, he laughed at us, laughed at our identification, and threw the documents on the top of his car. I would use the word racism to describe how they treated us.\"\nMack, who reviewed the case after a complaint was filed by the pair's lawyers, wrote that the two men, who have never been charged with a crime besides entering the country illegally, appeared to pose no security threat. She recommended that the department \"strongly consider\" releasing the two men.\n\"The only basis for the arrest seems to have been to give Border Patrol an opportunity to run an immigration investigation,\" she wrote. \"This is not a practice the department wishes to endorse or facilitate.\"\nThe total number of people deported from the U.S. has declined steadily over the past three years, since the Obama administration told immigration agents to focus more on deporting convicted criminals, repeat immigration violators and recent border crossers. Critics have said the limits have put more pressure on immigration agents to find creative ways to locate immigrants in the country illegally.\nBecause the two men have been removed before, an ICE spokesman said, they still meet the second priority under the department's Priority Enforcement Program, which went into effect earlier this year. That program replaced an earlier program called Secure Communities, which drew growing protests because of cases in which people were deported after traffic stops or minor arrests.\n\"As aliens previously removed from the United States who subsequently illegally re-entered the country, Mr. Barahona and Mr. Fugon both fall within an ICE enforcement priority category,\" said ICE spokesman Bryan D. Cox, who added that the agency has decided to deport the men.\nCox added that Mack's conclusions were speculative and \"not a formal finding\" of the department.\n(c)2015 Tribune Co.\nVisit Tribune Co. at www.latimes.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/politics/politicalnews/s-1738526", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/politics/politicalnews/s-1738526&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/politics/politicalnews/s-1738526&h=DHS+email+reveals+possible+profiling+of+immigrants+now+facing+deportation"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:06:00.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
