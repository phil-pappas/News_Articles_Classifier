According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, beans may even lower LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol levels, which can help boost heart health. Beans also do double duty in the food pyramid as both a vegetable and a protein. Not to mention, beans are easy to cook with, widely available and inexpensive .\nBeans and their legume cousins (such as soybeans, chickpeas and lentils) have been cultivated and consumed for centuries as a part of many world cuisines: Black beans figure prominently in Central American and Caribbean dishes, chickpeas are a staple of Middle Eastern cooking, lentils are common in Indian and Persian recipes, and white beans are a fixture of French and Italian cookbooks.\nEven though beans offer a slew of health benefits and culinary flexibility, they aren't a prominent staple of American diets—though many vegetarians routinely incorporate beans in their cooking. Perhaps it's a matter of taste or texture: By themselves, cooked beans aren't intensely flavorful (but that makes them a great foundation for other ingredients like tomatoes, peppers and herbs) and their texture can be a bit mushy if overcooked. Then there's the gastrointestinal effect that beans produce in some people. Because beans are high in both complex carbohydrates and soluble fiber, they can cause gas when they're digested in the large intestine. Rinsing canned beans can remove some of the sugars that can cause gas as well. (Beano, sold in most drug and grocery stores, is commonly thought to help avoid such distress. Adding a strip of kombu to dried beans during cooking also helps.) Learn how to make your beans less musical!\nBeans have such compelling nutritional benefits that they're worth experimenting with in your kitchen. Here’s how.\nCanned Beans vs. Dried Beans: Which is Better?\nCanned beans are super easy to use, and you'll find a number of options on your grocer's shelves. But, like many packaged foods, they can pack a lot of salt. When selecting canned beans, choose a low-sodium variety whenever possible. Scan the nutrition labels and opt for the product with the lowest sodium —levels can vary widely. For example, Eden Organic chickpeas have 30 milligrams of sodium per half cup serving; Progresso chickpeas have 280 milligrams for the same portion. Most recipes call for draining and rinsing canned beans and doing so removes up to 40% of the added sodium. Also, rinsing off the starchy liquid the beans were cooked and preserved in helps keep the beans from getting too soggy in your recipe--and remember that it helps reduce the gassy feeling beans can cause.\nThough canned beans are a quick and easy alternative to dried, it is worth noting that canned foods like beans may contain traces of the plastic chemical BPA , which can permeate canned foods through the plastic lining inside of the can. Very few brands of canned foods are made without BPA, so if exposure to this chemical concerns you, dried beans are the way to go.\nDried beans are quite easy to prepare from scratch, but they do take more time. Using dried varieties will also allow you to control how much salt is added and to get the texture you prefer. Some people believe that freshly cooked beans also taste better than canned.\nTo prepare dried beans, start with a bag from your grocer (you can also buy dried beans in bulk), then rinse the beans and pick out any small stones or broken pieces. Next, place the beans in a large bowl, cover them completely with water, and soak for several hours or overnight (they’ll expand, so make sure to use plenty of water). Soaking the beans reduces their cooking time. Drain the beans and place in a large pot, along with a stalk of celery, a carrot and a small onion, all cut into large chunks. Bring to a boil for about five minutes, then reduce to a simmer and cook until the beans are done to your taste. Cooked beans freeze well; simply portion them out in zip-top bags or freezer containers, spoon in a bit of cooking liquid, or drizzle with a bit of olive oil and freeze for up to six months. <pagebreak>\nSimple Ways to Bean-up Your Diet\nYou know that they are good for you, but how do you begin to incorporate beans into your meals? Here are four simple ideas, along with some healthful recipes you can try!\nIncorporate beans into your favorite dishes. Italian and Mexican recipes are easily enhanced with beans. Simply rinse and drain a can of black beans and add them to your favorite homemade or jarred salsa. Use the mixture to top tostadas or tacos. Or, make an easy and hearty traditional Italian pasta dish with sausage, spinach and white beans.\nAdd beans to soups and stews. White beans, also known as Cannellini beans, are prime candidates for the Italian soup called pasta e fagioli . Use kidney or black beans in your family's favorite chili recipe. Make a Cuban-style black bean soup that's packed with bell peppers and a kick of jalapeno; make it vegetarian by using vegetable stock instead of chicken.\nAdd beans to your repertoire of snacks and appetizers. A puree of Cannellini beans, garlic, olive oil and an herb like basil or rosemary makes a simple and flavorful spread for warm pita, flatbread crackers or bread sticks. Spread the puree on a slice of whole wheat bread and top with sliced tomatoes, red onion, red bell pepper, lettuce, cucumber or whatever's in the produce drawer for a protein-packed veggie sandwich.\nPack beans for lunch. The high fiber and protein content makes beans a smart addition to your midday meal. Combine a can of white beans (rinsed and drained), a can of light tuna, a bit of scallion, parsley, olive oil and lemon juice to make a Mediterranean-style salad that carries just 125 calories per serving. Or, toss white beans with a pint of cherry tomatoes (halved), a bit of Feta cheese, lemon juice, olive oil and cracked black pepper, then use whole wheat pita bread for scooping.\nNutrition Facts for Popular Beans\n Legumes, 1 cup cooked\n Protein\n Calories\n Fiber\n Black beans\n 15 g\n 227\n 15 g\n Garbanzo beans/Chickpeas\n 15 g\n 269\n 12 g\n Kidney beans\n 15 g\n 225\n 11 g\n Lentils\n 18 g\n 230\n 16 g\n Lima beans\n 15 g\n 216\n 13 g\n Navy beans\n 16 g\n 258\n 12 g\n Pinto beans\n 14 g\n 234\n 15 g\n Soybeans\n 29 g\n 298\n 10 g\n Split peas\n 16 g\n 231\n 16 g\nIf you're feeling adventurous, branch out beyond the navy beans you'll find in your local stores and look for varieties like Borlotti, Scarlet Runner, or Cranberry.
