You read right! The constant harassment. The emotional turmoil and the verbal abuse and threat caused by Debt Collecting Companies and Attorneys should be held liable for family suicides that happen due to financial hardships. It should be a criminal offense to take R900 of debt and escalate it with phone calls, summonses, letters, garnishing orders, sheriff fees and who knows what, to a R9000 account sometimes more. If you could not get the R900 what makes you think Mr / Mrs Debt Collector that you would get the R9000? How do you sleep at night knowing you have abused the system to pay for your expensive holidays, cars, homes and schools? When you pay religiously monthly and when you skip one month the sheriff stand at your door, traumatizing your children, creating chaos and panic. Because the sheriffs letter was ready way before you’re defaulted on a payment. In fact it was already ready to be sent just in case this happened. They know it will. Because families are barely hanging on to pay their basic needs. The collectors hang around like vultures with no regard or compassion of the stress and worry that keeps people up at night. So my question is how many have died because of the lack of tact or understanding collection agents? How many have given up, felt failures because there was no solution. Increasing your debt with all these legal costs makes it impossible to pay it back. Yes, some of you might be 'responsible', well earning, Trust supportive and debt free individuals with no burdens. Perhaps you can sit on your throne of righteousness and judge this situation. Even comment and give advice. But have you ever had to suffer through the humiliation of rejection because of debt. Not being able to go to work or keep your children at home because you have no petrol. You cannot give your baby milk and you try to sooth her with some water, while crying with her/him? Did you ever get a phone call from the school to fetch your child for unpaid school fees? Did you ever have to face your family at the supper table while there is hardly enough food to go around? Have you ever gone without electricity because that basic need is too expensive to reconnect? Not even considering the astronomic re-connection fee. Have you ever been shown away from a private hospital because you could not afford the deposit for your very sick child? Have you ever sat in a government hospital while you wonder if your child is going to make it through the night if she does not get attended to. Probably not Mr. And Mrs Director of Attorney firms and Debt Collecting Agencies. So next time your hear of a husband killing himself or a mother murdering her children and killing herself, you have contributed to this. Your shrewd wickedness and lack of compassion, your dishonesty and your methods have ended yet another life. Hurt another family. Debt will never be relieved until a law is in place to protect the consumer from excessive fees strategically added to debt collector’s bills. Have your opinion and have your say. Criticize, complain, laugh and joke. There will be those that do that. But when you are standing at the graveside of loved one that died because of debt, you might just remember this article after all....", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:40:40.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
