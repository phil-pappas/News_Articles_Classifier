The daylong conferences consist of sessions on topics such as \"Nailing the Interview: Attitude, Style and a Powerful Posture,\" with a panel that includes political analyst Nicolle Wallace, former White House communications director; Meredith Rollins, editor-in-chief of Redbook magazine; Michelle Smith, designer and founder of the Milly fashion line; and model Emme.\nAppearance matters, all of those panelists concur. But by overthinking it, women sometimes diminish their value in the workplace, Brzezinski said before the session — hastening to add she has made her own style missteps during her career.\n\"We stress ourselves out about it, and at times we end up with exactly the last thing we should be wearing,\" said Brzezinski, 48. \"I think if you're asking yourself the question, you really shouldn't wear it. Until you have a brand and look that works for you, I'd go simple, not exaggerating anything. Let the face and eyes do the communicating and not let the rest of you distract from your message. It takes a lot of the complication out of the process.\"\nSharing how her own style has evolved, Brzezinski pointed to her \"Know Your Value costume,\" a 5-year-old black sheath dress from Milly and a scarf, which she wore loose around her neck, her straight platinum blond hair grazing it.\nSmith, the Milly designer, keeps asking Brzezinski if she can give her a new version of that black dress. \"But I like the zip up the back of this one,\" Brzezinski said. It fits her tan, trim figure but doesn't hug the way past versions might have, she said.\n\"I'm just tired of holding my stomach in,\" Brzezinski said. \"And if you're tired of doing something, it shows on your face. The 'tight and bright' of television news just feels like a competition that's unwinnable, especially as you get older.\"\nBrzezinski recently began trading out her Christian Louboutin \"stilts\" for SJP single-sole pumps by Sarah Jessica Parker — still high but \"much more modest with classic lines,\" she said.\n\"I used to think that if you wore a high heel, a little platform would help you walk in it better,\" she said. \"But ultimately I think it looks a little needy. Looking at every picture where I've worn really high heels, I'm like, 'ew.' But the classic outfits, it could have been taken yesterday.\"\nShe had a similar epiphany with jewelry.\n\"I just don't wear any,\" she said. \"Every year in my early days of being a hostage to fashion, I'd wear jewelry, and a year later, I'd look at the tape and be like, 'Ugh, those earrings.' And every day you want certain things to be the same, and to me jewelry is kind of a distraction.\"\nThe heavy makeup of TV is inescapable. But she chopped her hair a few years ago to reduce distractions as well as primping time.\n\"I had the big cable news hair, blond and big,\" she said. \"I was wearing it up in a plastic clip one day — and I got in trouble with management for wearing a plastic clip — but the point is, it looked really short. And everyone really liked it.\"\nShorter hair provided consistency in her look, an asset when she travels from city to city.\n\"I think consistency is classic,\" she said. \"Plus, if someone has long hair and it's really fixed up, then you know that person has spent an hour of her life working on that hair. And what does that tell you about that person?\" she said. \"I was that person. And now, I'm free.\"\n NBCUniversal Sarah Jessica Parker", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561d8652/turbine/sc-fash-tight-and-bright-mika-brzezinski-msnbc-20151019"], "published": "2015-10-14T01:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:55:28.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
