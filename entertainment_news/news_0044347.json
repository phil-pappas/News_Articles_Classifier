When it comes to restaurants, however, it’s not always easy to bring along Henry, a yellow Lab puppy who’s training to be a therapy dog. \nKathryn’s Take \n“This is the perfect setting for that,” she says of socializing Henry at the Sequiota Bike Shop. She first noticed the small restaurant with outdoor seating on a walk with Henry and her other dog, Daisy, on the Sequiota Trail. She called to check on its dog-friendliness policies. Once she found out she and Henry would be welcome, she found a new favorite. \nToday when we sit down, Henry nestles under the table near her feet with the complimentary dog bone and water bowl the restaurant gave him as we walked in. “It’s very dog-friendly,” she says. “I love that it’s all outdoors.” \nA restaurant might be dog-friendly, but if it doesn’t have good food, it’s not going to stick. Kathryn, though, says the Sequiota Bike Shop has amazing sandwiches and salads. She loves finding restaurants with healthy food. She gets a salad and sandwich. Her favorite, the Tandem, comes with smoked turkey, peppered bacon, blue cheese, Romaine and house-made Chambord spread on sourdough. She tried the Tandem on her first visit, and “I’ve stuck with that ever since,” she says. She adds a side garden salad with basil ranch. \nA big part of Kathryn’s love for this sandwich is the panini-pressed sourdough bread. It reminds her of Mama Jean’s paninis, which she also enjoys. The Chambord spread adds some sweetness which complements the savory bacon and smoky blue cheese. \nKathryn and I also share a side of hummus and pita bread, which she notes is great because of the warm pita. We get more than enough to share. \nWhile we’re eating, Kathryn sends some direction to Henry every now and then, but for the most part, he’s happy with his Sequiota Bike Shop bone and water. “It’s going to be gorgeous later this fall,” she says of the outside space. \nKatie’s Take \nAs we eat, I notice an intense pull that makes me not want to go back to the office after lunch. I think Kathryn feels it, too. There’s something about sitting outside with fresh food in a beautiful setting that just says relaxation. An ideal time to visit Sequiota Bike Shop? Friday at 4 p.m. when you can really enjoy the outdoor space and even their alcoholic slushies. Yes, you read that correctly. It’s a super slushy grownup treat, and I can’t wait to come back and try one. \nWhen Kathryn recommended what sounds like a bike shop for eating purposes, I was bit skeptical. But now that I’m sitting in the space, I get it. How great would it be to rent one of the shop’s bikes and buy one of the baskets of food to go to take out along the trail? The shop also has tandem bicycles for rent. Talk about a deviation from the normal dinner and a movie. Those in the dating scene, take note! \nI’m not particularly an animal person, but it’s great to be able to take a dog to an outdoor restaurant. Henry does well, and his demeanor, along with the outside ambience, is making me quite relaxed, so he’s doing his job as a therapy dog in training. \nLike Kathryn, I opt for a sandwich, but I go for the Penny-Farthing, mostly because the name is too eye-catching. It has honey-glazed ham, roasted shallots, Parmesan, Romaine and spinach with house-made jam on wheatberry bread. It all sounds fancy on paper, but I much prefer Kathryn’s Tandem, most likely because of the bacon. I prefer the taste of the panini, instead of wheatberry bread. It does have some sweetness in it, but I need more to counteract the salt of the bacon. If I had to choose, I’d go for that Tandem every time. \nI get my sandwich with a house salad, which is fairly simple, but quite large and very fresh. That basil gives creamy ranch an unexpected fresh feel, and I actually find myself dipping my Penny-Farthing sandwich in the ranch, too. \nThe Dish, the Restaurant \nDuo Tom Muetzel and Anne Baker opened Sequiota Bike Shop in May. “We’ve been interested in that spot for a while,” he says. They’re also the pair behind Finnegan’s Wake and Ophelia’s, which recently closed, and they’ll be opening Civil Kitchen and Tap on the square soon. \nThe connection to nature is what makes the Sequiota Bike Shop’s spot so special. “It feels like you have the woods right at your back door,” he says. He’s seen deer, turkey, eagles and more wander up. Because of this connection to nature, it made sense to include canine friends in the restaurant’s outdoor seating. “Anne and I both have rescue animals,” he says. The shop is planning its first Barktober Fest on Oct. 24 to benefit the Humane Society. “It’s going to be a really good time,” he says. \nAnd what about owning an outdoor restaurant in the winter months? “We’re going to focus on office lunches, business catering and a lot of soups,” he says. The duo is also planning an expansion to keep customers happy and warm in winter months. \nThe libations can keep folks warm, too. The shop will offer hot and cold adult beverages, including the famous alcoholic slushies. Plus a big bonfire will make it feel like an adult summer camp. Though the menu’s not too varied, it is designed so that patrons can get their food to go in a bicycle, rented or not. The Tandem that Kathryn enjoys caters to that sweet and salty combo so many people love. It’s made with sourdough from local baker Artisan’s Oven. “Their bread is as good as it gets.” \nBaker leans toward the sweet and salty, while Muetzel admits he’s more of a herbal and savory guy. “She really likes the heat and the sweet,” he says, and the Tandem fits that niche. \nThe basil ranch we enjoyed is also made in house. Muetzel says he focuses on consistency in the produce he chooses, so sourcing locally isn’t always possible, but he tries to when he can. \nThere are many days that the bikes are all rented. “It’s not about a marathon as much as it is enjoying yourself,” he jokes. For a leisurely ride or a one-of-a-kind fun, grownup slushie, or maybe just a sandwich and salad, hit up the Sequiota Bike Shop.
