Fox Admits He Doesn't Remember Much About Filming \"Back to the Future\" Posted just a moment ago \nEric Liebowitz/NBC (NEW YORK) -- October 21, 2015 is a great day for Back to the Future fans. It's the date to which Michael J. Fox's Marty McFly and Christopher Lloyd's Doc Brown traveled forward in time in Back to the Future Part II. But Fox himself admits he would need to hop in a DeLorean and go back in time in order to actually remember filming the first film thirty years ago. \nAppearing on Wednesday's Live with Kelly and Michael, Fox said, \"When I did the movie I was doing Family Ties at the same time. So I was doing Family Ties in the daytime and Back to the Future at night. So a lot of it is a blur to me. I mean, I saw the movie and I was like, 'Oh! That's what we were doing?'\" \nStill, Fox does remember filming one awkward-yet-memorable scene with Lea Thompson, who portrayed his mother, Lorraine. As you'll recall, Fox's Marty travels back to 1955 to make sure his parents fall in love, but instead, Lorraine ends up falling for him, and kissing him at the Enchantment Under the Seas dance. \n\"Lea was so fantastic in that scene. She was so innocent and sexy and flirty at the same time and she did it perfectly,\" said Fox. \"So it was fun to play off of and when I saw her doing what she was doing, I said, \"This is going to be charming. This isn't going to be weird.\" \nA new documentary on the Back to the Future trilogy, Back In Time , will premiere digitally and on Netflix today to coincide with Marty and Doc's 2015 adventure. It includes interviews with Fox, Lloyd, co-star Lea Thompson, Gale, and others who were involved with the original film -- which is celebrating its 30-year anniversary -- and its sequels. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
