Dhoni - The Untold Story,” A.R. Murugadoss’ “Akira” and the biopic “Neerja.” \nT-Series held the music rights of Fox films like “Bol Bachchan,” “Raaz 3,” “Dum Maaro Dum” and “Force” as well. Of the new films, Rajshri Productions’ “Prem Ratan Dhan Payo” releases Nov. 12. The famous banner has been associated with HMV (now Saregama) since their inception in 1962, except for a film or two, and this is their first with T-Series. \n“M.S. Dhoni” stars Sushant Singh Rajput, and “Neerja” will mark director Ram Madhvani's Hindi debut. “Akira” is an action drama starring Sonakshi Sinha with music by Vishal-Shekhar. \nIn an era where a rival music company, Zee Music, is grabbing multiple big and small movies without really making an impact, this is another major triumph for the Numero Uno music label. \nMusic Labels Today \nThe music scene has undergone a paradigm change today. Here is the scene: \n• T-Series are the market leaders. They appeared in 1984. \n• Sony Music is taking on select films but is marketing the music under the Zee label also, as well as old Saregama albums. Sony appeared in 1998 in India. \n• Zee had existed for while from the mid-‘90s. Zee Music has many films, but their marketing and promotions suck — big-time! \n• Yash Raj Music markets its own music. Off and on, they have taken rare outside films. They came up in 2004. \n• Occasionally, Eros does the same with its films under its own label. \n• Tips do the music of its own productions, very rarely getting into an outside film. They appeared in 1989. \n• Saregama-HMV does not take film soundtracks anymore, with exceptions, like when some films need re-created songs. In films, HMV has existed since the ‘30s. \n• Venus seems to have given up films too, as their latest production “Kis Kisko Pyaar Karoon” had its music by Zee Music. \n• Weston and Time Audio, which were doing well in the ‘90s, sold their repertoire to Tips. \n• Universal no longer takes new films. \n• The smaller companies from the ‘90s till recently have all folded shop.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T07:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T18:17:14.632+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
