Swoboda said Sunday's event was his first time walking with the group but certainly won't be his last.\nThe group stepped off from Elgin Civic Plaza located between city hall and The Hemmens Cultural Center in the city's downtown.\nLast year, 144 walkers raised more than $24,000 in their locally organized CROP Hunger Walk.\nThis year, Elgin and some 2,000 cities and towns nationwide are joining together in interfaith community CROP Hunger Walks around the theme \"Ending hunger one step at a time.\"\n News Elgin Charities and Fundraising", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-19T01:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:34:30.614+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
