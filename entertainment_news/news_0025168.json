An unruly passenger can cause unnecessary turbulence for passengers on any flight — and often require an embarrassing trip back to the gate.\nThe latest person to be removed from a plane was a sobbing woman booted off her American Airlines flight , prompting boos from fellow passengers towards flight attendants.\nBut countless other travelers have made headlines for getting kicked off planes. The reasons range from rational to ridiculous and not even celebrities are immune to the rules of travel.\nHere are eight high-profile instances of stars being kicked off an aircraft:\n1. Alec Baldwin ANDREW GOMBERT/EPA Alec Baldwin made headline when he got botted off a flight over a game of \"Words with Friends.\" The “30 Rock” star is known just as much for his public scuffles as he is for his acting.\nIn 2011, Baldwin was escorted off a flight before it even took off — because he refused to shut off his phone.\nBaldwin was so engrossed in a game of “Words with Friends” that he refused to put the phone down — and fled to the plane’s bathroom, phone in hand.\nThe hot-headed actor later turned to Twitter to defend himself.\n2. Kevin Smith There just was’t enough room for all of Kevin Smith.\nThe “Clerks” director purchased two tickets in 2010 to comply with Southwest Airlines’ heavy policy.\nHowever, when switched to an early flight, there was no available extra seat for the slightly overweight actor and so, he was kicked off.\n“What was I gonna roll on a fellow passenger,” he later joked on Twitter.\n3. Naomi Campbell LOIC VENANCE/AFP/Getty Images British model Naomi Campbell once put up a fight while being psychically escorted off a flight. Known for once hitting her housekeeper with a phone, the supermodel took her diva antics to elevated heights.\nCampbell flew into a rage upon learning her bags were not on her flight, in 2008.\nShe refused to deplane and was dragged kicking and screaming from the aircraft.\n4. Billie Joe Armstrong The Green Day frontman and his saggy pants were booted off a plane in 2011.\nThe musician refused to pull his bottoms up and was led off the plane.\nRevealing bottoms have often led to deplaning. A University of New Mexico football player was kicked off and arrested the same year for baggy pants that showed his boxers.\n5. Christian Slater The actor ignored the number one rule of flying and boarded his flight with an unlicensed pistol in his luggage in 1994.\nHe was arrested and sentenced to three days of community service.\n6. Leisha Hailey The “L Word” star got a little too affectionate with her girlfriend onboard a flight in 2011.\nAfter passengers complained about the PDA, the actress and her girlfriend were kicked off the flight.\n7. Gerard Depardieu ANNE-CHRISTINE POUJOULAT/AFP/Getty Images The legendary French actor onced urinated onto a bottle onboard a flight. The French actor got disgustingly creative when nature called but the seatbelt sign was on.\nHe relieved himself in his seat, using a bottle in a 2011 flight.\nHowever, his aim was off and he spilled urine onto the floor, earning a boot off the plane.\n8. Ivana Trump Kids can be a handful to deal with on planes and Ivana Trump was having none of it on a 2009 flight.\nThe socialite launched into a nasty tirade against noisy children, even hurling around the F-word and “little f---\" at the youngsters running up and down the aisles.\nShe was escorted off the flight before it even took off.\nMDOSTIS@NYDAILYNEWS.COM\nRelated Stories Azealia Banks drops homophobic slur during airline meltdown Tags: news break , lists , alec baldwin , naomi campbell , gerard depardieu , ivanka trump , christian slater", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:29:18.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
