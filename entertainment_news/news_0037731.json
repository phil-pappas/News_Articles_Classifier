You can catch the live scoreboard and ball by ball commentary of Pak vs Eng 1st Test here while on the go. \nEngland are likely to unchanged into this Test match. Only Jonny Bairstow’s position looks vulnerable and the visitors have options in Alex Hales and James Taylor in their ranks but that decision will be extremely harsh on the red haired batsman. Pakistan will welcome ace leg-spinner Yasir Shah into the side. Pace Imran Khan might be the casualty in a place where Pakistan have beaten their opponents twice back in 2012. \nThe 1st Test match looked likely to head for a draw and that is when Adil Rashid, after recording what was one of the worst figures on debut spun a web around the Pakistani batsmen and took England within touching distance of victory. The collapse would have worried Misbah-ul-Haq. One bad hour undid all the good work they had put in during the first innings. Shoaib Malik’s roaring comeback in Tests with a double hundred and the contributions that came along with it proved that there is more spine to the Pakistan batting order than just Misbah or Younis Khan. Things will take a different turn in Dubai though. \nPakistan \nMisbah-ul-Haq (c), Ahmed Shehzad, Shan Masood, Azhar Ali, Mohammad Hafeez, Fawad Alam, Asad Shafiq, Younis Khan, Sarfraz Ahmed (wk), Yasir Shah, Zulfiqar Babar, Wahab Riaz, Imran Khan, Rahat Ali, Junaid Khan, Shoaib Malik, Bilal Asif \nEngland \nAlastair Cook (c),Moeen Ali, James Anderson, Jonny Bairstow,Ian Bell, Stuart Broad, Jos Buttler (wk), Alex Hales, Liam Plunkett, Adil Rashid, Joe Root, Ben Stokes, James Taylor, Mark Wood, Samit Patel, Chris Jordan \n  6:10 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:52:08.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
