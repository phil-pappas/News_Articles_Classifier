For 2015, Ropp decided to emphasize one facet -- the movies. \"This is a getting-back-to-the-roots year,\" Ropp said. \"What I mean is, over the years, we've been trying to do a film fest and a convention at the same time, which worked gloriously well for a few years. \"We created a monster. There were people who came who could care less about film and people who came to the films who could care less about the guests. We were trying to branch out into pleasing everyone.\" Though the emphasis is back on films, guests will appear this weekend, including actors Lynn Lowry, Tiffany Shepis and Chris Hahn. \"We're back to having guests who are there for a reason -- specifically if they have a film showing or some sort of promoting tie-in,\" Ropp said. That said, Ropp still plans to bring big names to Erie. He hopes to start a pop-culture convention that would focus on fan interaction with stars from film and TV. Luring top names in spring -- as opposed to October, when horror and sci-fi actors are in high demand -- should be easier. \"Case in point, we've tried to get people like Linda Blair, and their signing fees go up and become cost prohibitive,\" Ropp said. \"Celebs realize Erie is not Los Angeles. It makes more sense to do something not in October but later, when prices come down and availability goes up. So, we're looking to a full-fledged pop-culture convention, still with horror, but also sci-fi, fantasy and more importantly, classic TV stars.\" That won't happen until spring 2016 or 2017, however. This weekend, then, focuses on horror films with a varied collection of shorts and features from around the world. They vary in approach: monsters, psychological horror, repressed memories, killer breasts. \"It's really one of our best years for quality of movies,\" said John Walkiewicz, the vice-president of the Eerie Horror Film Festival. \"Most of them were scored very highly by our judges. There are some with recognizable stars. \"Our Saturday night movie, 'Bigfoot the Movie,' stars Curtis Wooten, who plays Pittsburgh Dad on YouTube. 'The Good Word' has an actor (Conleth Hill, aka Lord Varys) from 'Game of Thrones.' 'Julia,' which plays Saturday, is getting a theatrical release. But we're showing the unrated version; it'll be the R-rated one in theaters.\" \"Julia\" stars Ashley C. Williams, who was in the first \"The Human Centipede.\" More than 30 countries submitted films, and several filmmakers -- including Gregory Lamberson (\"Killer Rack\") -- will introduce their movies. \"We're focusing more on the films this year, so we don't have any real big names coming out,\" Walkiewicz said. \"First and foremost, it's an independent film festival. That's our main focus, and the celebrities are secondary.\" SEE ITThe 12th Annual Eerie Horror Film Festival will be held Friday through Sunday at the Warner Theatre.
