Matrimonial love was personified by Michael Louis Robinson and Earl Benjamin , the first same-sex couple to wed in Louisiana, who introduced the Leadership Award to Judge Paula Brown, who officiated their ceremony. Other honorees included: Political Activism Award: BreakOUT!, for its work with LGBTQ youth in New Orleans; and the Legal Award: Douglas Hallward-Driemeir, an attorney who successfully argued along with Mary Bonauto on behalf of the marriage plaintiffs in the United States Supreme Court in Obergefell v. Hodges.\nWhen emcee Bob Mann wasn't at the podium, event co-chairs Matt Davis and Sean Sullivan (also the Forum's foundation board chairman), Forum board Chairman Chris Otten, Forum PAC Chairman Justin Woods , Forum Executive Director SarahJane Brady, and board member Mary Griggs were there either introducing honorees or praising those who have helped the organization.
