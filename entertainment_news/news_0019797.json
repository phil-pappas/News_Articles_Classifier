We were so bummed that Brown's closed,” said Emily Root Sterling of Spencerport. “We needed to find someplace to fill the void.”\nFor the Sterling family, that void has been filled by Stokoe Farms, a seventh-generation farm teeming with pumpkins and unique autumn activities in Scottsville.\n“There is so much to do there,” Sterling said. “There’s a train ride, zip line for when the kids get older, an air pillow…”\nThe Sterlings don’t even get their pumpkins there (grandma buys them elsewhere), but they go to enjoy the experience.\n“It’s like a family fun day,” Sterling said. “We get a lot out of it.”\nArcher Sterling, 4, and Ariella Sterling, 2, from Spencerport, at Stokoe Farms in Scottsville. (Photo: Provided photo)\nFor the Dana family of Penfield, the focus is more on the pumpkins than the festivities. Their farm of choice is the low-key family farm Woody Acres in Penfield.\nWoody Acres’ pumpkin patch started small in 1995 as a roadside stand, and while it has grown over the last 20 years it is still quaint and quieter than some of the larger Rochester area patches.\nA plethora of pumpkins, which are all grown on the farm, are pre-picked and laid out for customers to choose from alongside a free hay bale maze.\n“They have a little maze for toddlers and an old fashion seesaw that's really neat,” said Stephanie Dana, about the farm’s big activity draws. “It is sweet and simple, which is why I like it.”\nBig or small, just like picking the perfect pumpkin, the beauty of picking the best pumpkin patch is in the eye of the beholder.\nThankfully, the Rochester area has many to choose from. Here’s a nice sampler of five diverse patches:\nStokoe Farms\nWhere: 656 South Road, Scottsville.\nHours: Pumpkin patch hours are 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Wednesday, Thursday and Fridays until Oct. 23.
