Various vendors were also set up around the downtown area.\nCruisin' the Coast registration director Chris Smilek said shortly after 5 p.m. Wednesday that 217 more Cruisers had registered, bringing the total to 7,214 -- leaving just 80 more to go to break last year's record of 7,293.\n\"Registration will be busy Thursday and we'll get quite a few more on Friday,\" Smilek said. \"I'm thinking we're going to end up somewhere in the 7,600 range.\"\nAttention turns to Ocean Springs Thursday, when three days of Cruisin' the Coast begin in the lone Cruisin' venue in Jackson County. City alderman Chic Cody, who is the city's Cruisin' coordinator, said they are prepared for the onslaught expected to arrive.\n\"We're expecting a lot more people this year,\" Cody said. \"Last time I checked, they were already close to 7,200 registered Cruisers. There's not much doubt it's going to be more than we've ever seen.\"\nCody said the city has taken steps to help alleviate parking issues in the downtown area, much of which will be closed off to all vehicles other than registered Cruisers. The city has secured the use of private property to provide parking for downtown merchants displaced by the Cruisers.\nOthers, including local business owners, have offered their parking lots, as well.\n\"We've had a lot of cooperation and support from our merchants,\" Cody said. \"They have really done a lot to encourage the Cruisers to come. We want them coming back for years to come.\"\nIn addition to Ocean Springs, Cruisin' venues in Bay St. Louis, Pass Christian, Edgewater Mall and D'Iberville will be open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Thursday.\nThursday's Cruisin' activities include the Vicari Auto Auction at the Mississippi Coast Coliseum & Convention Center and a Country Cruisin' Breakfast at the Long Beach Yacht Club from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m.\nThursday's other events:\nSwap Meet/Manufacturer's Midway on the grounds of the Mississippi Coast Coliseum from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Car Corral opens and vehicle check-in begins east of Treasure Bay casino, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Television personality Courtney Hansen will make appearances in Pass Christian from 10 a.m. to noon and in Bay St. Louis from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. Entertainment in Ocean Springs, presented on the stage off Cash Alley, will include:\nMr. Saxman -- 11 a.m. to noon Halfway Ray (Ray Charles Tribute) -- 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. Ron Adams Show -- 3 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T02:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:43:09.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
