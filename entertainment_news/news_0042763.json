That includes building a brand-new tollway through the northwest suburbs and around the western border of O'Hare International Airport.\nThe construction work will be paid for with nearly $1.3 billion in tolls to be collected from motorists. Much of this amount will come from a 40 percent hike in tolls imposed this year on trucks and 87.5 percent increase on passenger cars in 2012.\nAlthough the state's budget is mired in a deadlock between Gov. Bruce Rauner and Democratic legislative leaders, the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority is plowing ahead with a 15-year, $12 billion construction program that began under Rauner's predecessor, Pat Quinn.\nAs an independent state agency, the Tollway is not reliant on state and federal money to fund projects, unlike its counterpart, the Illinois Department of Transportation.\n\"It's a classic user-fee situation,\" Tollway Chairman Bob Schillerstrom said. \"The people who use the Tollway pay for it 100 percent. No one else pays for it. If you choose not to use the Tollway, you don't have to pay.\"\nSimilarly, Illinois law requires that Tollway revenue remain within the agency and not be used for other state purposes.\nTollway officials said the $1.4 billion in spending marks the biggest single-year investment in construction and infrastructure improvements in agency history, topping 2015's expected total.\nThe spending includes:\n•$577 million to complete roadway rebuilding and widening the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway (I-90);\n•$384 million to continue building the new, all-electronic Elgin O'Hare Western Access Project, officially designated as Illinois Route 390;\n•$105.3 million to complete resurfacing on the Reagan Memorial Tollway (I-88) from U.S. Route 52 to U.S. Route 30;\n•$68 million to begin design for reconstruction of the Central Tri-State Tollway (I-294);\n•$156 million for systemwide roadway, interchange and bridge repairs and other work.\nThe budget also contains $5.8 million to pay for planning studies for \"emerging projects,\" which could include an environmental impact study for the proposed extension of Route 53 through Lake County.\nSchillerstrom cautioned, however, that the Tollway's board has not yet decided to support that project and that including the planning money in the budget did not mean the board authorized the study.\nSeveral proponents and foes of the controversial project appeared before the board Thursday to air their concerns.\nAlso in 2016, $156 million has been budgeted for systemwide roadway, interchange and bridge repairs and other work to address the needs of the existing Tollway system.\nIn addition, the agency will spend $17 million to upgrade cameras at toll plazas to help ensure accuracy of toll violations,\nThe Tollway's board also approved four construction contracts totaling more than $130 million for roadway construction on the Addams Tollway.\nThe Tollway plans to issue $600 million in new bonds in 2016 to provide funding for new and future projects.\nWhile Moody's Investor's service downgraded the state's bond rating Thursday to Baa1 from A3, the Tollway's rating remains at Aa3 with Moody's and AA- with Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor's.\nTollway finance chief Michael Colsch said the agency's operating budget in 2016 will increase 3.6 percent over this year.\nThose costs include increases for health care and retirement contributions for Tollway employees; higher fees for services supporting electronic tolling and credit card use associated with toll revenue growth; and the operation of Route 390, Colsch said.\nThe agency's head count will remain at 1,596 in 2016, for the sixth consecutive year, Colsch said.\nThe agency will hold three hearings on the budget, which will be webcast, and is inviting public comment.
