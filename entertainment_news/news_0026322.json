The reality star recently revealed exactly what happens when he takes his daughters to visit their mother behind bars. \n\"We sit down and we talk,\" Joe told E! News . \"There's a snack menu and venues or whatever that you buy from and the kids go crazy because it's like one big room there, so they got a little toy room but they get a little antsy, you know, the young ones.\" \n\"It's kinda hard to like, talk to her, so the last 15 minutes, I just kinda send them on their way so can talk for a little bit and just hang out, me and her,\" he added. \nThe reality star said that the prison visits typically last around three hours, and the kids have gotten used to it. Joe says the girls bring things to show their mother during the visit, such as letters, pictures and their homework. \n\"At the beginning it was hard,\" he said. \"Now it's like kinda routine and they go just to see her, which makes her happy.\" \n\"I have a harder time saying goodbye than they do,\" Joe continued. \"Well, now it's, you know, better, but I mean...when you go to her in the beginning, it's rough, you know, watching her stay there. It sucks. But what are you gonna do? It's almost over, thank God.\" \nJoe also noted Teresa will occasionally want to pose for family photos in the federal prison. \"She loves taking pictures, even in there,\" said Joe. \nTeresa is set to be released in December. Joe, who was sentenced to three and a half years in prison for the same crime, will begin his time behind bars after Teresa is released. Their sentences were staggered in the interest of the couple's children. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:13:23.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
