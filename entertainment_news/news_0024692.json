He co-wrote the song in 1934. \nHis daughter and two granddaughters filed the lawsuit in Manhattan federal court in 2012. \nThey said an arm of the London-based music company EMI Group was due to lose its title to the song in December 2016. The appeals court agreed and said the family members will resume ownership of the rights at that time. \nLawyers did not immediately return messages seeking comment.
