Trump is being given 24 hours to acknowledge receipt of the letter. \n\"If Trump for President does not comply with our demands, our client will be forced to pursue any and all legal or equitable remedies which our client may have against you,\" the letter concludes. \nTrump was first told to not use \"Dream On\" after an August 21 event in Mobile, Alabama, claims the letter, but he continues to use it at events anyway, including a recent rally in Georgia. \nIn spite of the warning, the real estate mogul and the rocker actually share a mutual admiration and friendship. Tyler was once a judge at Trump's Miss USA pageant and they reportedly once traveled to Russia together. Last year, Trump went to an Aerosmith concert and tweeted it \"doesn't get any better than that.\" \nTyler's attorney, Dina LaPolt, writes in a statement, \"This is not a political nor personal issue with Mr. Trump. Steven works tirelessly with both Republicans and Democrats regarding copyright reform and his position has always been consistent regarding copyright and intellectual property. Simply, one must get permission from the music creators. Steven wrote 100% of 'Dream On,' and this is about the un-authorized use of his property. Steven is a registered Republican.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:15:16.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
