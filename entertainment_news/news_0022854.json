That light has shone more brightly some places than others. Two years after the reporting requirements went into effect, 42 Rochester-area schools in 14 districts told the state they had zero such incidents in the 2013-14 school year.\nSome of the schools have a reputation for well-behaved students, including those in Brighton, Fairport, Penfield and Pittsford. But even a generally serene student body would be hard-pressed to pass an entire school year without one material incident of harassment of any kind.\nAmanda Nickerson, director of the Alberti Center for Bullying Abuse Prevention at the University of Buffalo, said student surveys show that one in three children report being involved in bullying one way or another. Even more report being involved in some sort of harassment.\n“From what we know from multiple studies, bullying and harassment are common and it is nearly impossible for a school to have no incidents in an entire school year,” she said.\n“From what we know from multiple studies, bullying and harassment are common and it is nearly impossible for a school to have no incidents in an entire school year.”\nAmanda Nickerson, director of the Alberti Center for Bullying Abuse Prevention at the University of Buffalo Reportable behavior is defined under the law, in part, as: “conduct ... that has or would have the effect of unreasonably and substantially interfering with a student's educational performance, opportunities or benefits, or mental, emotional or physical well-being.”\nOf the 42 schools with no confirmed, reported incidents, 36 are elementary schools. The others are Twelve Corners Middle School in Brighton, Spry Middle School in Webster, Minerva Deland School in Fairport, Rochester Early College International High School and two charter schools, University Prep Charter School for Young Men and Rochester Career Mentoring Charter School.\nThere are two distinct but similar categories in which schools are supposed to report such offenses.\nOne is the Dignity for All Students Act, (DASA), which specifically gathers bullying and harassment incidents. The other, which has been in place longer, is the Violent and Disruptive Incident Report (VADIR), which has several sub-categories, including one for “intimidation, menacing, harassment or bullying,” either with or without a weapon.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nState to survey schools on anti-bullying efforts\nThe 42 schools, with a combined student body of more than 20,000, listed no incidents in either category.\nAll the districts involved either confirmed that there were, in fact, no reportable incidents in 2013-14 or did not respond to a request for comment.\nWhen asked whether the state education department believes the data it receives from schools is accurate, spokeswoman Jeanne Beattie pointed to a series of training sessions the state is providing on the subject and said that “NYSED continues to work with districts to ensure that VADIR and DASA data is reported accurately.”\nA report earlier this year by the state comptroller surveyed seven secondary schools from across the state, including East High School in Rochester, and found 935 unreported incidents under VADIR across all its categories in one school year.\nBesides those schools with zero bullying incidents, many reported only a handful, even at the middle school or high school levels.\nPenfield High School, for instance, reported just three incidents under VADIR and none under DASA. Fairport High School reported one under VADIR and two under DASA.\nWillink, one of Webster’s two middle schools, reported 28 incidents, while the other, Spry, reported zero. Both have about 1,000 students.\nSince the numbers vary so widely, it is impossible to know whether a school with many reported incidents truly has more incidents or is just more diligent in its reporting.\nThe secondary schools with the most reported DASA and VADIR bullying incidents are mostly in the Rochester School District, with East High School leading the way by an order of magnitude.\nThe DASA data is also broken down by the topic of bullying. There again, Monroe County children either showed remarkable civility or had their offenses go unreported.\nFor instance, there were only 29 reported instances of bullying related to weight across all the school districts in the county, which have a combined enrollment near 110,000.\nThere were 63 bullying incidents related to race, color or ethnicity; 75 related to gender or sex; 22 related to disability; and 39 related to sexual orientation. The lion’s share — 89 percent of the 2,248 total offenses — were marked down as “other.”\nBesides its reporting requirements, DASA also includes a framework of proactive training and intervention sessions that schools are supposed to follow. Nickerson said compliance there seems to be better.\nShe suspected reporting is sometimes low either because schools are confused about the requirements or because they fear being identified as unsafe.\n“It’s just sort of a crime count, so I’m sure some schools don’t want it to be a poor reflection of what they’re doing,” she said. “If another school is reporting zero and they were going to report 42 cases, that might make them pause. ... But (with better reporting) there would be an open acknowledgment that this is an issue and they’re taking it seriously.”\nJMURPHY7@Gannett.com\nDEMOCRATANDCHRONICLE.COM\nBullying incidents at area schools\nSchools with zero reported bullying incidents, 2013-14\nGo to rochester.nydatabases.com for a listing of the total reported incidents in 2013-14 for each public school in the Rochester area.\nDistrict School Enrollment Brighton Council Rock Primary School 732 Brighton Twelve Corners Middle School 808 Brighton French Road Elementary School 818 Brockport Ginther Elementary School 559 Churchville-Chili Churchville Elementary School 418 Fairport Minerva Deland School 498 Fairport Northside School 681 Fairport Dudley School 645 Gates Chili Florence Brasser School 279 Greece Brookside Elementary School Campus 373 Greece Holmes Road Elementary School 410 Honeoye Falls-Lima Lima Elementary School 300 Penfield Cobbles Elementary School 465 Penfield Indian Landing Elementary School 443 Penfield Harris Hill Elementary School 469 Pittsford Mendon Center Elementary School 764 Pittsford Thornell Road School 447 Rochester School 43 - Theodore Roosevelt 545 Rochester School 52 - Frank Fowler Dow 357 Rochester School 57 - Early Childhood School 247 Rochester Rochester Early College International High School 333 Rochester charter school Genesee Community Charter School 216 Rochester charter school Urban Choice Charter School 398 Rochester charter school University Preparatory Charter School For Young Men 393 Rochester charter school Rochester Career Mentoring Charter School 158 Spencerport William C.
