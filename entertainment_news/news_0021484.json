No charges have been filed.\n\"Viola was so excited to go on this vacation,\" said longtime friend Gabriela Williams.\nWilliams grew up with Flores in Aurora, where they attended middle school and East Aurora High School together. They've been friends ever since.\n\"I've never seen her as happy as she's been lately,\" she said.\nWilliams described Flores as a wonderful mother to her adult children, Robert Flores III and Adriana Munoz-Flores. Her 20-month-old granddaughter was also the light of Flores' life, Williams said.\nFormer Aurora resident killed in Florida crash Courtesy of Flores family Viola Flores of Lake in the Hills, a former resident of Aurora and Naperville, was killed along with her boyfriend while on vacation in Florida.

(Courtesy of Flores family) \"She was their everything and they were her everything,\" Williams said.\nThe accident has left many, including Flores' son, reeling in pain, she said.\nRobert Flores said he has been overwhelmed with media interviews since the crash and wasn't up for speaking, but pointed reporters to his mother's Facebook page to better understand what kind of woman she was.\nFriends recalled growing up with Flores, playing jacks on the front porch, and then watching her become a doting mother and grandmother. Dozens of people chimed in on Flores' page to offer the family condolences.\n\"(Viola's) laughter was unforgettable,\" Williams said. \"She had such a great spirit.\"\nFlores' son said the family lived in Aurora until 1994 when they moved to Naperville. Flores stayed there until moving to Lake in the Hills several years ago, where she was living at the time of her death.\nOn Flores' Facebook page, she posted updates of her trip, all the way up until hours before she and her boyfriend was struck and killed.\nHer last check-in was at a tap house in Clearwater. In the same post, Flores posted a picture of herself at a trolley stop heading back to her hotel to get ready for a night out with Berg.\nFollowing the hit and run crash, police released several photos and videos of the vehicle, including video surveillance from nearby businesses. They also received tips from people all over the Tampa Bay area.\nOn Wednesday, police announced that they had seized a vehicle matching the suspect car description from the home of a Tampa man.\n\"It's just heartless to think someone could leave them there,\" Williams said, adding that she hopes charges against the suspect are quickly filed.\nVisitation and memorial for Flores will be held on Sunday from 2 to 6 p.m. at Beidelman-Kunsch Funeral Home, 516 S. Washington St. in Naperville.\nA Celebration Mass in honor of Viola Flores will be held on Monday at 10:30 a.m. at St. Thomas the Apostle Church, 1500 Brookdale Road, Naperville.\newurst@tribpub.com\nCopyright Â© 2015, Aurora Beacon-News Traffic Accidents Aurora", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56295475/turbine/ct-ctlh-ct-abn-flores-florida-fatal-st-1-2-jpg-20151022", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56295474/turbine/ct-abn-flores-florida-fatal-st-1023-20151022"], "published": "2015-10-22T23:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:10:54.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
