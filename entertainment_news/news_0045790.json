M-Tech, a mobile manufacturer, has launched a new smartphone Jazbaa in association with the Sanjay Gupta directorial. “I’m so proud and happy that M-Tech has launched the ‘Jazbaa’ mobile. It breaks the conventional norm of current film marketing campaigns by not doing just a vanilla co-branded campaign,” Gupta said in a statement. “What sets this association apart is the fact that the ‘Jazbaa’ phone is not merely a phone that has ‘Jazbaa’ branding, it also embodies the characters, theme and slickness of the film in its software as well,” he said, and wished the company good luck. The film’s cast, along with the managing director and co-founder of M-tech mobile, Vivek Agarwal and co-founder Goutam Jain, unveiled the smartphone. “After the nationwide success in 2014-2015 with our feature and smartphones sales crossing 1 million units and generating revenue more than Rs.100 crore, we are extremely excited to launch our ‘Jazbaa’ brand in Indian market. “We target to achieve the turnover of around Rs.1,000 crore by March 2018 which will take us a step ahead in the Indian mobile market,” Agarwal said. Jain said that it is a “brilliant” step to name a smartphone after a “much awaited movie”. “M-Tech is proud to have the brand associated with the movie and have its in- film branding in the movie. It will be marketed through company’s offline distributors covering across 1000 stores in the initial phase thereby flooding the mid-segment market,” he added. With a sleek design, the Jazbaa smartphone has 1.3 GHz quad core processor with 2 GB Ram and 16 GB ROM. It has a 15.2 cm (5 inch) HD IPS display, operates on Android 5.1 lollipop and is powered with a 13 mega pixel AF rear camera with LED flash and 5 mega pixel front camera.
