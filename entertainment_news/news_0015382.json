Photo: Supplied \nThey among the most recognisable women in arts – Cate Blanchett​ and Frida Kahlo​ – and both are at the centre of the Art Gallery of NSW's 2016 season.\nBlanchett is the face of a newly commissioned piece of cinematic art by German artist Julian Rosefeldt​ which has been co-commissioned by AGNSW with Melbourne's Australian Centre for the Moving Image. The show will launch in Melbourne in December before opening in Sydney on May 28. \nIn Manifesto , the Oscar-winning actress inhabits 13 different personas, including a school teacher, puppeteer, newsreader, a taxi driver and homeless man, while bringing to dramatic life the musings and philosophies of artists, and artist movements, architects, dancers and filmmakers. \nA self-portrait by Frida Khalo: 'Diego on my mind' Photo: Supplied \nMeanwhile, a 40-piece collection from renowned Mexican artist Frida Kahlo and her husband Diego Rivera will present many of the couple's most famous works, including Kahlo's startling  Self-Portrait With Monkeys . \nAdvertisement The exhibition will also include 50 photographs of the couple, who were famed for their tempestuous relationship that was marred by affairs on both sides, including  Kahlo's dalliance with Leon Trotsky and Rivera's affair with Kahlo's sister, Cristina.\nIn a coup for AGNSW, the exhibition will only be shown in Sydney and comes from the renowned collection of Jacques and Natasha Gelman.      \nAlso announced at the 2016 season launch on Thursday was Tang: Art from the Silk Road Capital , a major exhibition of 130 Chinese artefacts from the province of Shaanxi. \nIt is the first exhibition to focus on the Tang period (618-907), and will include gild, silver, glass and ceramics and mural paintings, and is another Sydney-only show.\nAlso on the roster for next year are exhibitions from the renowned Australian artist Tracey Moffatt, and Milingimbi , which presents the gallery's collections from the island community in Arnhem Land.\nThe Dobell Australian Drawing Prize Biennial returns for the second time, featuring six artists - Jumaadi, Maria Kontis, Richard Lewer, Noel McKenna, Catherine O'Donnell and Nyapanyapa​ Yunupingu​ - who will draw on the themes of narrative, memory and experience. \nThe launch of the 2016 program comes a week ahead of the opening of the gallery's blockbuster summer exhibition, The Greats , which draws on masterpieces from the National Gallery of Scotland and will include works from Rembrandt, Botticelli and Vermeer. \nwith Linda Morris", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T10:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T13:19:35.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
