Published by New York City-based Page Publishing, Wesley Spears’s sensational tale follows Thaddeous Daniels, a black criminal defense attorney with a reputation of being unbeatable. Thaddeous becomes entangled in a mystery of his own making, which mushrooms out of control. His latest trial involved an attempted murder charge against an Armenian, with the victim being a high-ranking member of a group known only as the Collective.\nThe Collective was a group of black misfit Ivy League intellectuals who were organized in order to ponder the hidden meaning of life. The Collective has a number of secret financial dealings and businesses which finance its operations.\nThe Collective is actually a straw company for a race of Aliens known as Deondrens. The Deondrens sought to use the Collective to accomplish their goals on earth after centuries of involvement.\nThaddeous is the missing link for the Deondrens and the Collective. The Deondrens' long-term goals relied on Thaddeous being unbeatable in the court room as they sought a home on earth.\nReaders who wish to experience this fantastical work can purchase “The Deondren Gene” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708.\nAbout Page Publishing\nPage Publishing is a traditional New York based full-service publishing house that handles all of the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
