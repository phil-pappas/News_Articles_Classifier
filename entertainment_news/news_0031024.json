As promised, the Canadian rapper dropped the official visuals for his latest smashing hit on late Monday night, October 19 via Apple Music. The clip opens with a bunch of ladies working in a call center. Later, Drake is seen singing and dancing alone in front of several backdrops with different colors and on a staircase. A girl joins him towards the end of the video. \"Hotline Bling\" was first debuted in July amid Drizzy's feud with Meek Mill . Currently spending its second week at No. 2 on Billboard Hot 100, the track has been expected to become the 28-year-old star's first to top the esteemed singles chart. Drizzy recently responded to the expectation in an Instagram post. He said that having the song at the list's No. 1 would be \"the biggest moment of my career to date.\" \"If you are looking for me on that particular evening I will be passed out in the water slide that connects to our pool,\" he joked before thanking his fans, \"I love you and thank you for these memories. I always love the moment right before it happens more than when it actually happens. So thank you ... even if it doesn't.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T05:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:30:22.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
