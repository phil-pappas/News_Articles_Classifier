We're basically trying to replicate everything that we're doing here over there.\nThe other items shipped by the Jets include cereal, extension cords, gauze pads and wrist bands.\nThe team members also met with a speech therapist and were each given a pair of orange glasses for their trip to help them doze without blue light interference from phones and tablets.\nCopyright 2015 by United Press International Share Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1731781&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1731781", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1731781&h=New+York+Jets+bring+350+rolls+of+toilet+paper+to+London"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T12:24:58.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
