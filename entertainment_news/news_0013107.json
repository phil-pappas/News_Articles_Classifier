Bringing one’s own chair or just sitting in a provided one is fine too. On the screen will be an old Colonial Theatre movie — Roy Rogers’ “Trail of Robin Hood\" from 1950, shown via an original 16mm projector along with a number of cartoon shorts. \nA sample “car” is displayed in the parlor, where there is a sign-up sheet for those who would like an actual ride that evening. There is no admission, but food will be sold with proceeds going to the church’s mission project. Everyone is invited to come and enjoy a fun evening, watching movies and eating popcorn and hot dogs “like we used to at the drive-in.” \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
