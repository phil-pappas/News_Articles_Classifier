Because I would love to do it again.” \nAn original coach when the show premiered in 2011, Green left last year after facing charges in a felony drug case. He pleaded no contest to giving a woman ecstasy at a 2012 dinner and recently completed his sentenced community service. He remains on probation. \nAfter entering the plea, Green posted a series of messages on Twitter, including one that read: “Women who have really been raped REMEMBER!!!” He later posted an apology, but the statements led to the cancellation of a reality show and several concert appearances. \n“It was a very redefining moment in my personal and professional life,” Green said. “I get in front of my creator, humbled, and I ask, ‘What does this mean? What is this supposed to mean for me? What am I supposed to learn from it?’ And [to] have that revealed and have it bestowed upon me is a blessing, of sorts.” \n“I feel really strong and really confident about this album and going forward,” he continued. “And I’m so grateful that you yourself, and everyone who just may happen to witness this particular interview, have my deepest, sincerest apologies for any inconvenience, any ignorance, any ill will, anything. I’m just glad that it’s behind me now. I’m so glad for it.” \nAssociated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:34:40.122+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
