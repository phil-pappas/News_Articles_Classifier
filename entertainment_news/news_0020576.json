As part of a global initiative to turn the World UN Blue, Edinburgh Castle turned blue on Saturday to mark the 70th anniversary of the Charter of the United Nations and to encourage people to reflect on the United Nation’s achievements over the last seven decades since its formal establishment on October 24, 1945, Xinhua reported. \nScottish Culture, Europe and External Affairs Secretary Fiona Hyslop, said: “While we celebrate the UN’s 70th anniversary, we know that more work is required by all of us to fulfil the promise of a life in peace and dignity for all that the UN stands for. Scotland shares the UN’s value and goals and is committed to promoting them.” \nShe hailed Scottish civil society organisations and individuals for working hard to help the UN achieve its aims, often as unpaid volunteers, and encouraged more people to join their efforts. \n  25, 2015 2:58 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T00:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:09:27.519+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
