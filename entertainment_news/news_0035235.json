They are almost the reverse of cinema. With films, the broader and more basic (and more action-packed) the literary version, the more successful the big screen version. John Grisham novels, for instance, make cracking films. Television is somehow more suited to books of ideas. The TV translation of James Patterson's Zoo was no more ludicrous than the book, but on the small screen suddenly the gaping holes in logic and flimsy characterisation were disastrously on display. Dickens, on the other hand, or more recently, Tsiolkas, depend on ideas as embodied by a vivid range of characters and as a result have made for far more satisfying viewing. Which brings us to this luscious new local drama, based on Tolstoy's Anna Karenina , which lies somewhere between the two. This is a contemporary retelling, but honours most of the specifics of the original. In a series of clever tweaks, the Karenins are now not aristocracy but famous former tennis champs; Vronsky is not a dashing cavalry officer but a sexy musician; and so on. It's equally cleverly cast, including Sarah Snook and Rodger Corser as the impossibly handsome Ivins (Karenins); Sophie Lowe as ditzy Kitty; and Gina Riley as Anna and Kitty's imperious Old Money mother. The production is absolutely gorgeous in every detail, from its well-paced, thoughtful script to the note-perfect locations and rich cinematography. But as we're no longer in feudal Russia, many of the ideas that sustained the original have inevitably fallen by the wayside. With the politics (in the broadest sense) stripped away, what's left is a series of romances that wouldn't be out of place on Ramsay Street, and a protagonist whose actions – freed from the social chains in which they originally took place – seem not so much tragic as profoundly immature. However, this remains a story exploring all the different faces of love in an intelligent and powerful way, and for many viewers that will be enough.\nNO ACTIVITY\nNew series\n★★★&frac12;\nstan.com.au \nNew Aussie comedy: No Activity . Photo: Supplied \nIf all local content commissioned by the new streaming services turns out to be this good, we're in for some fine times. Taking a leaf from Jerry Seinfeld's playbook (the comedy about nothing) and adding an acerbic touch of reality, this new part-scripted, part-improvised series revolves around a police stakeout during which our fearless detectives are obliged to regularly report that there is no activity. The first local production from the new kids on the TV block, it takes full advantage of our connected world. It's the brainchild of the team from Jungleboys ( A Moody Christmas, The Elegant Gentleman's Guide to Knife Fighting ) and the fact that one of them – Trent O'Donnell – is now based in LA seems to be no impediment. The show is shot in both Australia and LA, and O'Donnell, Phil Lloyd and Jason Burrows have collaborated seamlessly with both each other and the terrific cast (including Patrick Brammall​, Darren Gilshenan​, Genevieve Morris, and David Field) to produce a wonderful piece of work that's both completely absurd, and firmly grounded in the best sort of observational comedy. Even more impressive is that it's impossible to tell where the script ends and the improv begins, creating a naturalistic vibe that's seductive, surprising, and (most importantly) very funny. \nAdvertisement FARGO\nSeries return\n★★★&frac12;\nWednesday, October 21, 8.30pm, SBS \nNoah Hawley pulled off something of a miracle when he retooled the magnificent Coen brothers' film into a 10-part TV series. Spinning that same 90-minute concept into a second season is quite the ask and at first it feels like he hasn't quite hit his target. Fortunately, SBS is screening the first two episodes back to back tonight, and by the time we get through those first 50 pages, so to speak, Hawley's vision is starting to become clear. Fargo 2.0 promises to be every bit as fun, surprising and thought-provoking as the original.  \nTHE AFFAIR\n★★★&frac12;\nMonday, October 19, 7.30pm, Showcase  \nAs it moves through its second season, The Affair continues to display both the best and the worst of season one. The cast is tremendous, particularly Ruth Wilson as Alison, and its thoughtful investigation of the rippling shockwaves from an extramarital affair is compelling. But again the \"unreliable narrator\" device – the, literally, incredible differences in the way characters remember identical events (even assuming some of them are lying) – is unnecessarily ham-fisted. The same manoeuvre, done with more subtlety, would have made this close to perfect. \nTHE PLAYER\n★★★\nWednesday, October 21, 9.30pm, Seven \nIt came as no surprise to discover the writer and co-creator of this new US series, John Rogers, has an enduring love affair – and working relationship – with comic books. From the premise ( Person of Interest meets Las Vegas ) to Wesley Snipes' deliciously pantomime-y performance, The Player is broad, colourful strokes every step of the way. We don't quite get a Ka-Pow! caption during the plentiful biffo, but we're not far off. And absolutely nothing that occurs here is believable in the slightest. But does that matter? Absolutely not. \nMILLION DOLLAR LISTINGS LA\n★★★\nSaturday, October 24, 7.15pm, Arena \nOnce we get a bit of office shenanigans out of the way, this instalment of Million Dollar Listings: LA is great fun. From the wildly botoxed faces of the clients and the scary eastern European property developers to the extraordinary properties our lads are trying to offload there's always something eye-popping to see. There is often genuine interest in the strategies the various brokers use to get the best price (or simply get a property off their hands), and tonight's ep ends on a truly remarkable turn of events that had me desperate to find out what's behind it. \nDOGS: THEIR SECRET LIVES\n★★★&frac12;\nMonday, October 19, 7.30pm, SBS \nThe whole arena of dog psychology is fascinating and this British study, although small, makes both a valuable contribution to the field and provides plenty of food for thought for dog owners. The specific issue under investigation is separation anxiety – something just about every custodian of a pooch will be familiar with – and along with quite distressing footage of just what an anxious dog gets up to when his people leave the house, there's some really interesting science about what's going on physically with the animal, and what we can do to help. \nTHE DAILY SHOW WITH TREVOR NOAH\n★★&frac12;\nTues-Fri,  October 20-23, Comedy \nIf you've ever seen Trevor Noah do stand-up, you'll know he's very polished, very charming and very funny. Unfortunately, at this early stage, he's not really bringing that package to The Daily Show . It's a very different medium, of course. It also must be absolutely terrifying slipping in to Jon Stewart's chair. So hopefully he'll relax and improve as time goes by. For now, though, the nerves are palpable, the timing in his comic routines misses by a considerable margin, and his interviewing skills need quite a bit of work.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:02:47.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
