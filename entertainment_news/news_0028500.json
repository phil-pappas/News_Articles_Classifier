Now I have to write a song called Cheezels and Puma because I like them too,” she said. \nThirwall said along with Get Weird ’s adult content, there will be the inevitable “songs about break-ups”. The video for Love Me Like You features a lookalike for Malik. \nShe said the hectic schedule of Little Mix’s promotional duties throughout the UK was helping to mend Edwards’ broken heart. \n“She’s good. We’re very lucky we have each other whatever happens and our main thing will always be our friendship because whenever something happens in our personal lives, that is all that matters,” Thirwall said. 60s sound ...
