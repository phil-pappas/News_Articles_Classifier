Now the movie star is revealing exactly what went wrong. \n\"Relationships ending are painful, and you can choose to carry that or you can choose to reframe it,\" Hudson told Allure magazine. \"If Matt and I had a great relationship, we would still be together, but we chose to move on because we had different visions of how we wanted to live our lives.\" \nThe two, who ended their engagement December 2014 after a four-year romance, have a four-year-old son, Bingham Hawn Bellamy. Hudson also has an 11-year-old son, Ryder Robinson, with ex-husband Chris Robinson. \nHudson said she and Bellamy wanted to remain committed to raising their son together. \"That doesn't mean, though, that we can't rebuild something that would be the best thing for the kids,\" she added. \"We said, 'We need to try to create something for the kids where they feel like they're gaining something rather than losing something.'\" \nSo far, Hudson and the Muse frontman have been doing a good job, according to the actress. \"It's been a seamless transition,\" she said. \"Kids just want to see their parents be cool. Everybody's cool; everybody's good.\" \nHudson -- who is the daughter of Goldie Hawn and Bill Hudson, but was raised by her mother's longtime partner, Kurt Russell -- told the magazine it was important to her that her children have two parents to look up to. \n\"Being someone who has come from a broken family and has a stepfather, I really benefited from having that very consistent [presence] in my life,\" she said. \"It's something I am mindful of and want in my life.\" \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
