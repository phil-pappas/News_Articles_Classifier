El Genio can be heard in 75% of Hispanic households, and the company has extended its partnership for an additional four years.

The first two programs are video extensions of Entravision's Audio Network. The LMShow will be hosted by Hyacinth Iztel and LATV's entertainment insider, Dennis Pastorizo. Las Super 20 will serve as a music video countdown featuring two leading music genres: Latin Pop and Regional Mexican. The format will include interviews, videos and commentary, and will be hosted by Vanessa Palomino and Emmy Award winner Carlos Alvarez . The Road to Reventon is an extension of Entravision's premier musical event, Reventon, and will be an inside look at what it takes to rise from an unknown artist to the headlining band at one of the biggest Latin music festivals in the country, Reventon Super Estrella. Entravision's partnership with LATV is a uniquely powerful and flexible combination of media that offers advertisers an incredible opportunity to hyper-target consumers across a variety of diverse media channels.

Through the company's partnership with the Children's Miracle Networks (CMN), Entravision's talented on-air staff and the increased reach of its online and mobile platforms raised approximately $2.9 million for 95 member hospitals during the eighth annual 2015 Radiothon. To date, the company has helped CMN raise over $10 million . Health and Civic Engagement are always top priorities at Entravision.
