British Prime Minister David Cameron on Tuesday appointed Ma to his business advisory group. Xi has signed a series of trade contracts on his state visit, despite criticism from human rights groups who accuse the British government of turning a blind eye to human rights abuses by Beijing. \n  3:31 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:52:32.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
