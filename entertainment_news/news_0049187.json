However, in a very recent and rare interview, Moranis explained that he isn't retired as such, he's just a lot more careful about what he does.\n\"I'm interested in anything that I would find interesting. I still get the occasional query about a film or television role... and as soon as one comes along that piques my interest, I'll probably do it,\" explained Moranis.\nHowever, on the topic of Paul Feig's all-female Ghostbusters reboot, he was less than interested.\n\"I hope it's terrific. But it just makes no sense to me. Why would I do just one day of shooting on something I did 30 years ago?\" BECAUSE YOU WERE AMAZING IN IT, MAN, AND WE WANT TO SEE YOU IN STUFF AGAIN.\nAs it stands, Moranis is happy with his lot and content not to engage with either social media, the Internet in general or comedy writing or performance - and we'll all just have to live with it.\nWe'll always have Louis Tully.\nVia THR.com\nMORE: Confirmed - Bill Murray will appear in the new Ghostbusters film\nMORE: No, actually, there's only one Ghostbusters movie on the way now\nMORE: Pics: Is the all-female Ghostbusters set in the '80s?
