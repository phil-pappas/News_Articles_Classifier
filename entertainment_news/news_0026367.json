Cole and Kanye West. \n\"Some people may have heard of him,\" Carter's attorney Andrew Bart said of West. \n\"One or two,\" Carter responded. \"He's running for president.\" \nThe rapper was more serious when questioned about the rights to \"Khosara Khosara,\" which he said he thought had been properly negotiated after issues were raised following the release of \"Big Pimpin'.\" \nCarter gave mostly curt answers, responding \"yes\" or \"no\" or \"correct\" to many questions. \nLawyers for Carter and Timbaland, whose real name is Timothy Mosely, told jurors on Tuesday that Hamdi's family had been repeatedly paid for the use of \"Khosara Khosara.\" Four notes from the song's 74 notes are repeated throughout \"Big Pimpin',\" a music expert testified Wednesday. \nRoss has accused Carter of lacing vulgar lyrics over Hamdi's beautiful melody without receiving the proper permission, although \"Big Pimpin's\" lyrics are not an issue in the case. \nCarter declined to say Wednesday that the song, which is about leading a promiscuous lifestyle, was vulgar. He said the song featured \"adult lyrics\" and he still enjoyed performing it. \n\"I like the song,\" Carter said. \"It's pretty good.\" \n___ \nAnthony McCartney can be reached at http://twitter.com/mccartneyAP Â© 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc.
