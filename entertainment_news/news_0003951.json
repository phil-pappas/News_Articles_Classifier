The new Mofo, says Ritchie, is to be all about percussion.\nAdvertisement Ritchie said percussion has been assailed in recent years by computerised competitors, so he is focussing Mofo on the human-made beat, with percussive soloists being a strong element.\nOne of the highlights of Mofo, he said, will be the solo Scottish percussionist Evelyn Glennie, who is deaf – making her interpretation of drumming especially fascinating.\nThere will also be the Flaming Lips, DJ Krush and composer Antonio Sanchez, who will do a live performance at MONA of his soundtrack for the film Birdman .\nMofo will coincide with MONA's much-awaited the Art Exhibition by infamous British artists Gilbert & George.\nFor the first time, Mofo will have its hub at MONA, rather than in central Hobart, and about 5000 people are expected to enjoy the many events at various venues – even at the MONA ferry terminal.\nRitchie said Mofo was being held at MONA because its many interesting spaces had wonderful acoustics – and he didn't want to get complacent about the tone or geographics of the festival.\n\"We pride ourselves on the unexpected,\" he said. \"We don't want to get formulaic. We'll be able to have people on the lawn, inside the site, all over MONA. People will be able to get a diverse experience.\"\nMona Foma takes place over January 13-18, see  www.mofo.net.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:46:09.615+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
