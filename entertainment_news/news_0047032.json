Courtesy Channel Seven October 3rd 2015 2 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/Entertainment/ \nACCLAIMED British chart-topper Ellie Goulding has laughed off her brush with the AFL entertainment curse, preferring technical glitches to being a “perfect pop star”. \nGoulding copped criticism and accusations of miming during her pre-game performance on Saturday. \nThe 28-year-old singer, who is widely praised for nailing high notes out of the reach of mere mortals, jokes that she is an abject failure as a mime artist. \nAs explained by her Australian promoter Michael Gudinski, a sound technician pressed play on the backing tracks for both of her hits Love Me Like You Do and Burn instead of one at a time. \n“I would rather something go wrong than go up there and people think I am this perfect pop star who everything goes right for, and I’m not human, I’m a robot,” she said. \nGoulding, who rocked out with her band during a concert at the Enmore Theatre on Sunday night, said she had no choice but to sing live to the backing track.
