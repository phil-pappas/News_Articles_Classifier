This thriller is being directed by debutant Sundara Elango, a former assistant to director Bala. Talking about the film, the director says, \"This story revolves around the life of a woman undercover cop. Arundhathi of Naaigal Jaakirathai fame plays the role of the cop and she has done a good job in this bold character. She had to do a lot of homework for her role. Her character investigates crimes that involve a lot of risks and challenges. Like Thani Oruvan, this film's story will also be a good versus evil thriller.\"\nHe adds, \"Recently, the death of a woman cop Vishnupriya made headlines and it is being investigated now. My protagonist's role is also similar to that cop and the film features many incidents that tell what kind of pressures a woman cop faces during their tenure.\" The film has Ramkumar playing the male lead, the music is composed by Selva Ganesh and the songs are written by Kabilan.
