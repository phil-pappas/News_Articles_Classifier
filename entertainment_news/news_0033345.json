The 49-year-old actor said twenty years ago, in the Indian movie industry, roles were very clearly defined and they provided the security of one's stardom in a sense, reports the Express Tribune. Khan explained that previously in the industry, if someone played the role of a police man in three films, he would do the same for his next 33 films and added that he took a leap to change it not because he was brave, but because he was called ugly by one of his director friends. The 'Dilwale' star further noted that his friend actually used the words that his face was not chocolaty enough for the roles.
