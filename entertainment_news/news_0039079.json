The two will be discussing their recently-released “uncookbook” “Love on a Plate.”\nBrotman and Rothkranz are on a mission to change the way people eat by teaching people to cook healthy food they’ll actually want to eat. Believing you shouldn’t have to sacrifice taste to eat healthy, Brotman and Rothkranz have created an “uncookbook” full of recipes for everyone’s favorite dishes including burgers, mac ‘n’ cheese, bacon, cookies, pies, cakes and more!\nSo what’s an uncookbook?\nBrotman and Rothkanz use the term uncookbook because all recipes in the book are for a raw vegan diet. None of their recipes include meat dairy, wheat, sugar or anything else unnatural.\n“Instead of trying to fight a desire for these foods that’s wired into our brains, the way to switch over to healthy foods is to have the same experience we are used to, without sacrificing anything in the way of taste, look or smell,” the duo said.\n“Love on a Plate” is designed to help even the most novice vegan eat better. The book begins with the basics including a guide on what type of cooking equipment you’ll need as well as a guide to the basic vegan food necessities.\nOnce you have the basics covered, you’ll learn how to begin your raw food adventure by creating delicious drinks, snacks, dinner, lunches and breakfasts.\nTune in to The Ed Bernstein show this Sunday at 3:00 p.m. to hear Brotman and Kothkanz discuss how to properly obtain nutrients from an all vegan diet, how you can trick your taste buds in to eating only healthy food and more.\nContact:\nEd Bernstein\nhttps://www.edbernstein.com/\n888-235-3090", "external_links": ["https://www.edbernstein.com/"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:50:50.632+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
