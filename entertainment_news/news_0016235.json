(Photo: Shockroc1, YouTube) \nNote: App users, this story is best viewed in a web browser. \nWe don't know how much of the Last Week Tonight budget goes to creating weird mascots, but it's pretty much always money well spent. (For instance, there was Creepy Baby With Hulk Hands in a Tutu , his idea for the Department of Health and Human Services, and Jeff the Diseased Lung in a Cowboy Hat , his pick for Marlboro.) \nOn Sunday's episode, John Oliver devoted a good chunk of air time to convincing Canadiansto vote sitting conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper out of office, on the grounds that he panders to Islamaphobes, plays in a terrible band and worst of all, poses for photos withNickelback singer Chad Kroeger. \nOnly problem with Oliver's approach? It's illegal for foreigners to attempt to sway Canadian elections. In fact, it carries a 6-month prison stint and a $5,000 fine. \n\"That's a ridiculous law,\" he stated. \"So I guess what you're saying, Canada, is you want to dance?\" \nNot only is Oliver willing to do the time (\"You think I'm scared of six months in Canadian prison? What's that? Six months of living in Ottawa?\") and pay the fine (\"If telling you not to vote for Stephen Harper is going to cost me $5,000, I'm going to get my money's worth and I'm gonna do it in the most Canadian way possible.\") \nAww yeah, it's weird mascot time! \n\"I'm going to tell you not to vote for Stephen Harper alongside a beaver playing Sweet Caroline on the keyboard and this moose receiving a colonoscopy under Canada's fantastic single-payer system ... and finally, with one of Canada's finest sons, Mike Myers, dressed as a Mountie, driving a snowplow. It just doesn't get any more Canadian than this!\" \nAnd it was all going smoothly until Oliver made Myers relive one of the most awkward moments of his career. You know the one : \nOliver: \"Stephen Harper doesn't care about black people!\" \nMyers: \"Oh God, not again!\" \nOliver: \"Sorry, what I meant to say was, Stephen Harper doesn't care about Muslim people.\" \nMyers: \"Totally fair!\" \nSpeaking of famous quotes, Oliver took the Internet to task for misappropriating quotes, including this one that's regularly attributed to him: \n\"One failed attempt at a shoe bomb, and we have to take our shoes off at the airport. Thirty-one school shootings since Columbine and no change in the regulation of guns.\" \n\"It's an interesting thought but here's the thing, I never said that! But I've seen it so many times, I'm now genuinely starting to wonder if I did!\" Read or Share this story: http://on.wtsp.com/1LGwDvp More Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:47:26.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
