Sorry men — despite testicles’ extremely important biological function, they’re not all that pleasant to look at or touch or interact with in any way.\nOne artist is out to change the way we look at them with his ambitious Instagram project, Nutscapes . Philadelphia-based artist Clancy Philbrick (***man bun alert***) takes stunning landscape shots with a twist: each of them features a hairy nustack dangling in the frame. He’s basically the Ansel Adams of balls.\n\"A FLOWER DOES NOT THINK OF COMPETING WITH THE FLOWER NEXT TO IT.

He gets about two submissions per week, which seems surprisingly low to me, but, then again, I’m an exhibitionist.\nHe also likens them to selfies, telling the Daily Dot that \"the testes create a unique shift in the traditional regard for landscape photography, in which the subject is typically in the middle ground, while also clearly placing the photographer, a component that is almost always out of the frame, squarely within the photograph. It’s like a new selfie of sorts.” (Sorry dude, but it's not a selfie unless your balls are gripping your smartphone and taking the photo themselves. Let that image sink in for a second.)\n\"The dog's kennel is not the place to keep a sausage.\" #danish #proverb || #mansbestfriend #mountains #dogs #k9unit #travel #landscapephotography #puppies #labs #labradores #bestfriends @adventurenaked\nA photo posted by NUTSCAPES (@nutscapes) on\nAug 6, 2015 at 4:30pm PDT\nDigging deeper, he mused, “in our modern and historical world where men run and have ran at least 80 percent of the countries, the positioning of testes looming over these pristine landscapes proposes a lot of interesting questions in regards to mankind versus nature, stewardship, responsibility, seeds and future progeny, and masculine vulnerability.”\nOnly a man could take a photo of a nutsack so damn seriously.", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/p/6D3h11gasU/", "https://instagram.com/p/zLxL_lAarb/", "https://instagram.com/nutscapes/", "https://instagram.com/p/0VslE8gaoZ/", "http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/nutscapes-instagram/", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/22/opinion/is-this-a-selfie.html", "http://clancyphilbrick.com/"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:56:56.167+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
