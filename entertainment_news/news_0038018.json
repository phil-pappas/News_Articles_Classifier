He actually wanted Firth naked, but was overruled by a prudish BBC. \nInstead, a fully-clothed Darcy exuded bottled-up desire for the heroine, with just a bucket's worth of water and a few words. \nDavies wrote many things into the script to sex it up, but it was Firth's withering looks at Jennifer Ehle's Elizabeth Bennet, or \"Lizzy\", that really melted viewers. Whether we credit Davies, Firth, or both, most would agree that the 1995 BBC series was the origin of \"Sexy Darcy\". \nHistory suggests otherwise. \nDavies wasn't the first Austen adapter to capitalise on Darcy's pent-up yearnings, and Firth wasn't the first actor to emphasise erogenous zones. To be sure, more than a century of two- and three-dimensional Darcys included some who had neither good looks nor charisma, but it also included smoulderers who left their mark on audiences. \nIn the beginning, Fitzwilliam Darcy was peripheral to retellings of Pride and Prejudice. That may stem from Austen's novel itself, which famously keeps readers in the dark about his physical appearance and stirrings of desire. \nOddly, that situation continued even after an illustrated edition in 1833. Its images depicted Lizzy, Mr Bennet, and Lady Catherine de Bourgh but never Mr Darcy. \nPerhaps everyone knew what \"£10,000 a year\" looked like. \nIn subsequent editions, Darcy was rarely a tantalising specimen of manhood. Artists gave him a receding hairline, a protruding belly or a crooked nose. Noted illustrator Hugh Thomson drew a more fetching version in 1894 - younger, more dapper, with gorgeous hair and a well-turned leg - but all that seems inscrutably foppish. Early playwrights followed suit, putting audiences in the same emotional position as Elizabeth, at first despising a flat, rather uncolourful would-be hero. \nThe plays' big reveal at the end showed Darcy to be likeable and marriageable - if they showed him at all. Pride and Prejudice was first adapted in short scenes designed for drawing rooms or schools, most of which relegated Darcy to an off-stage idea. \nThe character first appeared on the professional stage in 1901 in a play now lost. Rosina Filippi's The Bennets had E Harcourt Williams, a melodramatic Shakespearean actor, as Darcy. In the US, a few years later, Mary Steele Mackaye published a four-act Pride and Prejudice. Her leading man is strangely violent, once cracking a whip with an angry \"Damn!\", and vowing before Elizabeth that he'll settle matters with Lady Catherine (the hotheaded Heathcliff-ing of Austen's hero began long before Joe Wright's film version, in 2005, in which Matthew Macfadyen plays Darcy to Keira Knightley's Lizzy). The first undeniably sexy Darcy emerged in 1935, with Helen Jerome's three-act adaptation, a Broadway - then a West End - hit. \nJerome's Elizabeth is regrettably a crier, but her witty, fervid Darcy marks an important turning point. In his first proposal scene, he delivers his lines \"slowly and passionately\", referring to \"this love for you that consumes me\". He's \"white with emotion\" and \"filled with hidden yearning\". \n\"Elizabeth, I love you,\" he declares. When he exits, Elizabeth weeps. After the second proposal, Elizabeth sheds tears (again), as Darcy softly delivers the play's final lines. \nAt Jerome's climax, sexy Darcy takes centre-stage. He was first played in New York by Colin Keith-Johnston, an Englishman known for his avant-garde modern-dress Hamlet, snarling, rebellious, cigarette-smoking, and violent. Surviving photographs of his Darcy hint at this energy, as he leans over Elizabeth at her desk, or stands a little too close, head cocked, knee bent. Audiences ate it up. \nNot long after, MGM snapped up the film rights for $50,000. Posters hyped up: \"One of the most famous novels ... One of the most famous plays ... And now, it will be one of the most famous pictures ever filmed!\" \nThe film's byzantine creation story features a years-long search for a Darcy. After a failed plan to cast a pre-Gone With the Wind Clark Gable, many rumoured male leads followed, all tall, dark, and box-office pre-approved. MGM went with Laurence Olivier, pulled in after his star turn as Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights. He was cast opposite Greer Garson as Elizabeth Bennet. \nOlivier's Darcy was self-assured but educable, slightly leering but poetic, not mysteriously hateful or violent. The camera played up the fact that Lizzy and the other women couldn't take their eyes off of him. He raised heart rates. \nUntil Firth, no one had come close to unseating Olivier as the ur-Darcy. David Rintoul's ultra-stiff attempt in the 1980 BBC version looks ridiculously old-fashioned by comparison, and, in Bride and Prejudice (2004), Gurinder Chadha's Bollywood-inspired remake, Martin Henderson is completely upstaged by the brilliant Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. \nFirth gave us the first Darcy capable of muscling Olivier out of the way. Macfadyen's portrayal a decade later seems merely to ape Firth's, hosing him down with added Brontë. \nWhen I asked Simon Langton, who directed the 1995 series, about Firth's appeal - which he says was unanimously recognised by female cast members - he describes a \"unique 'steadiness' or emotional containment\". \nFirth, he says, was \"seemingly unaware\" and \"more importantly, acts as if he is unaware, unlike any number of well-known preeners in the business, who are all too well aware\". \n\"This lack of conscious self-attraction very often has the effect of making the subject even more attractive to the inquisitive eye, especially when combined with an enigmatic aloofness sometimes mistaken for arrogance,\" he adds. \nThere were 55 uneventful years between Olivier's and Firth's renditions. But there was, very nearly, another contender. In 1974, Hollywood toyed with making another Pride and Prejudice. An unrealised script, co-written by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E Lee, survives from Universal Studios. \nTucked away in archived files are letters identifying the project's producer as Hunt Stromberg Jr, primarily a TV man who worked on The Beverly Hillbillies and Gilligan's Island. This film would have been a son's nostalgia trip: Stromberg Sr produced the Olivier film. \nPerhaps, rather than seeking ever more novel twists on the Pride and Prejudice theme - and with apologies to those involved in next year's film adaptation of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, which will see Sam Riley play a samurai sword-wielding Darcy - the most fitting way to mark 20 years since the BBC series is less to do with the undead and more to do with unfinished business. \nWhat we really need is Firth and Ehle as Mr and Mrs Bennet. Now that could change everything. \n- INDEPENDENT", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:18:05.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
