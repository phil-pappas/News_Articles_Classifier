'American Horror Story: Hotel,' Wednesday, 10 p.m. ET, FX\nCo-creator Ryan Murphy pulled off a coup casting Lady Gaga in a major role as the proprietor of a mysterious hotel in the fifth season of his disturbing anthology series.\nAlongside his cast of regulars and semi-regulars (but without Jessica Lange), this year's series also stars Matt Bomer, Max Greenfield, Naomi Campbell and Darren Criss.\nThe typically surreal trailer gives us a few clues as to what to expect, but with this series, there's always an element of shock and surprises.\n2. 'The Affair' Sunday 10 p.m., Showtime\nThe Golden Globe winner for best drama series is back, and for the uninitiated, one reason it has won over many critics is the fact that it uses multiple perspectives and jumps timelines; the steamy show includes a murder mystery and great performances by Dominic West, Ruth Wilson, Joshua Jackson and Maura Tierney.\n\"The Affair\" itself is just the tip of the iceberg.\n3. 'The Flash,' Tuesday 8 p.m., The CW\nThe DC Comics adaptation of the \"Scarlet Speedster\" broke ratings records for the CW last season, and it's back to break the laws of physics once again (plus, more time-traveling).\nMore characters from the comic books should appear as well to face our hero, Grant Gustin.\n4. 'Homeland,' Sunday 9 p.m., Showtime\nA funny thing quietly happened last season: \"Homeland's\" fourth season staged a comeback for the show, according to critics, who weren't fans of the third season (spoiler alert: the last one with Damian Lewis).\nSo expectations are higher now for season 5, which continues to focus on the story of Claire Danes' always-on-edge Carrie Mathison, now in self-imposed exile from the CIA.\nSay what you will: this show is never boring.\n5. 'The Leftovers,' Sunday 9 p.m., HBO\nSeason two of one of the most unusual shows on TV is here.\nJustin Theroux and Amy Brenneman return, and continue to deal with the aftermath of an unexplained event that resulted in 140 million people disappearing from the Earth.\nThe involvement of Damon Lindelof, co-creator of \"Lost,\" lets you know what you're in for.\n6. 'iZombie,' Tuesday 9 p.m., The CW\n\"Veronica Mars\" creator Rob Thomas took what could have been a corny or campy concept, based on a Vertigo Comics series, and made it into excellent television.\nMuch of the credit goes to star Rose McIver's performance as the title zombie, Liv, in a world where zombies only go crazy for brains when they get really angry (the rest of the time Liv sprinkles brains in with her food).\nThis season, we can expect Liv's visions to continue to give her insight into murders in Seattle and for the scheming zombie Blaine to try to get revenge.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/uVOR9D8FRbQ", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/ghrEiLgehDU", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/e9RlsD8lIO0", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/wyJu_qV4aEY", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/3yBHxsTnIXg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/mxC0wZIhZak"], "published": "2015-10-05T18:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T15:00:13.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
