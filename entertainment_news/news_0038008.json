Broad St.) is the latest concept from brothers Robert and Benjamin Bynum, who owned the former Zanzibar Blue - where Nutter courted his wife, Lisa. The Bynums also own Warmdaddy's (1600 S. Columbus Blvd.) and the politically popular Relish restaurant (7152 Ogontz Ave.). \nRobert Bynum, who's called Nutter his best friend for the past 40 years, said the two met in ninth grade at St. Joseph's Prep, became fast friends and went on to college together at the University of Pennsylvania. \nBack in the day, Nutter worked for the Bynums' father at then-club Impulse, at Broad Street and Germantown Avenue. Although he dabbled on the turntables, he said it was dirty work that mostly kept him busy. \n\"We were the guys who cleaned that place,\" Nutter said. \"We were guys who took out the trash.\" \n\"Michael and/or the city have played up this DJ thing,\" said Bynum. \"But it was carrying ice, doing the grunge work [that] he learned to really work hard there - not being in the limelight - and worked his way up.\" \nThe new jazz spot and restaurant South will feature live music seven nights a week. Cho vs. Philly \nComedian Margaret Cho has been sounding off on social media after news broke that the two men who pleaded guilty to attacking a gay couple in Center City won't serve time. \nOn Twitter this weekend, she wrote, \"I just don't know who to turn to see why gay bashers go free in Philly. And don't Ma'am me. Where should I write?\" \nCho got the attention of Philly police on social media, and they handled it pretty professionally IMHO. \"All of us have sworn an oath to and it's both an honor and a privilege. Thank you for your kind words. Stay safe,\" @PhillyPolice wrote on Twitter. \nThe third co-defendant in the case turned down a plea deal and plans to go to trial. Cornell charms his Merriam crowd \nChris Cornell , clad in flannel and denim, wowed a packed Merriam Theater on Thursday with renditions of his grunge-era hits. He played Soundgarden's \"Black Hole Sun,\" Audioslave's \"I Am the Highway,\" Temple of the Dog's \"Huger Strike\" - and covered Sinead O'Connor's \"Nothing Compares 2 U.\" \nI was seated next to WMMR's Pierre Robert, who got a personal shout-out from Cornell, much to the pleasure of the audience. Council hopeful gets Wild One's nod \nRepublican City Council at-large candidate Al Taubenberger recently scored the endorsement of hometown hunk Bobby Rydell . Rydell will guest-host a fundraiser for Taubenberger tomorrow night at the FOP Lodge 5 Hall (11630 Caroline Road), in the Northeast. \nHe's expected to perform several of his classic hits, along with his recently recorded single, \"Philadelphia, I'm in Love.\" Taubenberger vowed that, if elected Nov. 3, he'd sponsor a City Council resolution making the tune Philly's official theme song. \nTickets ($50-$76) are available at the door. Beer great gets tube time \nTom Kehoe, founding father of Yards Brewing Co. (901 N. Delaware Ave.), will be featured in an episode of \"Uncommon Grounds\" tonight on the Travel Channel. \nKehoe and the crew went to Iceland with local La Colombe creator Todd Carmichael to brew a coffee pale ale called \"Snorri's Awakening,\" with Icelandic beer company Einstok.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T13:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:55:40.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
