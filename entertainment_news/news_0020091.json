Slater said his department needs additional resources to carry out an inspection of all of the park's bridges, particularly after seven years of budget cuts.\nThe incident had a much better outcome than the deaths of 14 individuals at New Zealand's Cave Creek in April of 1995. Thirteen students and one Department of Conservation officer died when a poorly built viewing platform gave way. Slater said that incident spurred the department to install \"a very comprehensive and robust asset management approach\" to prevent such events.\nThe Lake Waikaremoana Great Walk is one of nine administered by the Department of Conservation. The track takes three to four days to hike through and is popular with tourists.\nCopyright 2015 by United Press International Share Comment", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1735829&h=New+Zealand+hikers+film+fall+from+collapsed+bridge", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1735829&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1735829"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T01:25:40.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
