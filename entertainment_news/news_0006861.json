(AP) - \"Jersey Shore\" reality TV show star Michael \"The Situation\" Sorrentino has a new attorney for his federal tax fraud case. \nNewark lawyer Henry Klingeman says Wednesday he's \"looking forward to helping (Sorrentino) and the court move the case forward.\" \nAmong Klingeman's former clients is \"Real Housewives of New Jersey\" star Teresa Giudice. She is currently in prison after pleading guilty to tax charges. \nSorrentino and brother Marc have pleaded not guilty to charges they filed bogus tax returns on nearly $9 million and claimed millions in personal expenses as business expenses. \nSorrentino's first attorney withdrew in August, saying Sorrentino failed to pay his bills. A trial isn't expected before December. \nSorrentino appeared on all six seasons of MTV's \"Jersey Shore,\" which followed the lives of a group of young Italian-Americans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T16:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:16:21.517+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
