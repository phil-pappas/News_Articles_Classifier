The \" I Am Cait \" star dared to flaunt her busty cleavage in a revealing red suit for the occasion. The former Olympic athlete looked stunning in the red suit with plunging neckline. Cailtyn wore matching trousers and a pair of golden heels. She put her wavy hair into side parting. During the event, she took the stage to present an award. When Caitlyn was called to come to the stage, audience gave her a standing ovation. \"A standing ovation for coming out here and not tripping in heels,\" Caitlyn poked fun at the standing ovation given to her. \"I appreciate that very much. Actually, it's kind of interesting I've always been really tall but I walk out here today and I say, 'Wait a second, I'm a little bit taller than I usually am,' so I have to adjust the mic here a bit because girls, it's all about the shoes, isn't it? Let's be honest. It certainly is.\" Caitlyn compared her speech at that time to her lengthy acceptance speech at the ESPY Awards in July. \"When I did that, honestly I had to divorce myself from where I was. I'd been at the ESPY Awards many, many times. I couldn't put it in my head, and I'm standing up there in my perfectly executed Donatella Versace gown,\" Cailtyn joked, drawing more cheers. \"Looking down at LeBron James and Brett Favre and I'm thinking, 'I can't go there, I just have to stick to my speech,' but somehow I look at this audience and I just am not that intimidated.\" The Voices on Point Gala was presented by the Point Foundation. The event featured \"Point Scholars sharing their compelling stories of perseverance on the same stage as acclaimed recording artists.\" The event aimed to benefit the foundation which supports \"LGBTQ students achieving their dreams of higher education and a better future.\" A day prior to the event, Caitlyn appeared in a live-streaming video on Kim Kardashian 's website. The 65-year-old reality TV star confessed, \"I am forced to wear makeup everyday.\" Responding to what Caitlyn said, Kim replied, \"You're not forced, this was a choice.\" \"I am forced [to wear makeup] because Kim Kardashian told me '[I've] got to rock it every day.' If I walk out the door and don't look at least good and presentable [photogs are] gonna use that shot forever,\" Caitlyn gave the reason. Kim giggled and said, \"Absolutely.\" The pregnant reality TV star then gushed over Caitlyn's natural makeup. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T06:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:59:20.173+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
