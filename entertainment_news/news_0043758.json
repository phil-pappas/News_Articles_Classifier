Photo: Tim Swallow \nBut after a world premiere at the CinefestOz Film Festival in Western Australia two years ago, it has hardly screened other than a season at Narooma cinema on the NSW south coast and special event sessions in capital cities.\nAdvertisement \"My hands are shaking,\" said Sneddon on hearing the film was Australia's entry. \"It's amazing.\"\nShot for just $120,000, Arrows of The Thunder Dragon is an unusual filmmaking venture.\nNational sport in Bhutan ... Arrows the Thunder Dragon . \nSneddon, who lives in who lives in Gembrook in Victoria's Dandenong Ranges, is a musician and screen composer who became a monk, realised it was not for him then turned to filmmaking.\nSeeing writing and directing as an extension of his monastic work, he teamed up with a Bhutanese cast and crew.\nInstead of organising auditions, his novice co-producer delivered just six actors for the six main roles the day before the astrologer decreed that filming must start.\nSneddon's mantra was: \"do the best you can with what you have.\"\nArrows of The Thunder Dragon stars Tshering Zangmo as a village woman who learns archery, Bhutan's national sport, from her warrior grandfather in the 1980s.\nAfter the premiere, Sneddon reworked the film, adding scenes for a longer version that was finished in April. He estimates the final budget at $350,000 once fees and wages are paid.\nThe film was inspired by his affection for Bhutan.\n\"The combination of sophisticated cleverness and worldly simplicity I find quite striking,\" he said. \"And it's a beautiful place, Bhutan.\n\"Wherever I went, I thought if you point a camera at anything - the light, the mountains, the trees - this place is just made for a film.\"\nThe country has been the location for only a few films, with the best-known being Tibetan lama Khyentse Norbu's The Cup and Travellers and Magicians .\nAustralia has never had a nomination for best foreign language film at the Academy Awards despite selections for the three past years - the indigenous drama Charlie's Country, Laos drama The Rocket and German drama Lore .\nSneddon is hopeful more than confident about his chances of landing an Oscar nomination in January. \n\"This is a micro-budget film and it's up against the best of [all the other] countries,\" he said. \"But it's an interesting story that people will want to see because they're learning about a completely remote culture that they've never come across before.\n\"So I'm hoping it might be put in for its interest value.\"\nThe selection came after an independent panel, arranged by Screen Australia, assessed films with predominantly non-English dialogue.\n\"Despite being an English-speaking country, Arrows of the Thunder Dragon marks our fourth selection in a row for this category,\" said Richard Harris, the agency's head of business and audience. \"We heartily congratulate Greg and all the team ... and now wait with bated breath to see if the film makes the next selection hurdle.\"\nIt is up against films from 80 other countries.\nArrows of the Thunder Dragon (2015) Official Trailer from Greg Sneddon on Vimeo .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:46:52.555+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
