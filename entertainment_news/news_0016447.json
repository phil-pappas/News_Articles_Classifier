The film titled Birth is already in post production, but in the last six months that it was in the making, everything about the film was kept a secret. The first look of the film shows Shriki and Duniya Rashmi in tribal attire. Speaking to Mirror, Shriki said, \"It was done on purpose. Not many people in the industry know that we are doing this movie, let alone completed shooting. This is the first time we are revealing the look.\nAnd, before you ask, it is a tribal subject and the costume you see in the picture is not just for a few scenes. I wear that costume in the entire film.\" The film is directed by first-time director Shivu Holalu. Apart from Shriki and Rashmi, most of the other actors are newcomers. \"It is not just the subject that is not regular but also the pattern of the film. It is very unconventional and that is one of the reasons we did not announce the film before it was complete. Like regular films, it has songs and it also has the length of a normal feature film. But when it comes to the way it was made, it offers a completely new experience. There are many things which I cannot talk about at the moment. The director has rightly forbidden anyone from speaking about it. The secrecy about the film was because of its unique content.\"\nThe costumes for the film was changed to suit the script. Shriki said, \"The first costume we came up with looked like what soldiers in ancient kingdoms wore. Then we tried tweaking it. But we realised it would not do justice to the subject and we settled on the tribal look. I cut my hair uneven to look convincing. Now, when I look at it, all the trouble looks worthwhile.\" Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-13T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:20:36.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
