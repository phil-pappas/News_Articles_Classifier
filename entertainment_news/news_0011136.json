Related Stories Defendant Kenny admitted Tasing Mathew Ajibade four times at the Chatham County jail Mathew Ajibade ignored for an hour and half prior to death at Chatham County jail Related Links The full story: Mathew Ajibade case timeline By Jan Skutch The lead investigator in the death of Mathew Ajibade in the Chatham County jail testified today that he misstated the requirement of contract nurse Gregory Brown to check a restraint inmate every 15 minutes rather than two hours.\nGBI agent Cyrus Purdiman told a Chatham County Superior Court jury that he has since learned that the 15-minute requirement applied to custody staff and the two-hour requirement applied to someone in the medical field.\n“That was inaccurate information,” Purdiman said of his testimony before the Chatham County grand jury. “However, it was the information I had at the time.”\nPurdiman, under examination by Brown’s lawyer, conceded that after the trial in this case started was when he received the complete Corizon Health policy.\n“It (the 15-minute requirement) doesn’t apply to Gregory Brown under the circumstances,” Purdiman agreed with attorney Tom Withers.\nTestimony before the Chatham County Superior Court jury resumed today after a day’s recess. Judge James F. Bass Jr. held court on Saturday in an effort to catch with trial projections.\nAjibade, 21, died in the restraining chair, a spit mask covering his face, sometime before 1:38 a.m. Jan. 2 after jail staff failed to monitor him for an hour and a half.\nEvidence has shown that Ajibade was in handcuffs and leg shackles to restrain him after the earlier scuffle at the jail following his arrest Jan. 1 and was being placed in a restraining chair in Cell 4 of the old booking section of the jail when Kenny called for a Taser and spit mask.\nEvidence showed that Kenny was not originally assigned to the pre-booking area on Jan. 1 but moved there after Sgt. Anza Rowland was disabled in the scuffle with Ajibade.\nHe told investigators he was the “only supervisor in that area” at the time he Tased Ajibade and told anyone who was not a member of the Corrections Emergency Response Team to leave the cell.\nKenny, 31, and former deputy Maxine Evans, 56, along with Gregory Brown, a 45-year-old Corizon Health licensed practical nurse at the jail, are on trial for involuntary manslaughter for causing Ajibade’s death “without any intention to do so.” The charge said that Kenny caused the death during the commission of “reckless conduct...without intention to do so by tasing (Ajibade) while he was restrained.”\nThe other two are charged with reckless conduct by failing to monitor Ajibade’s status.\nIn addition, Kenny and Evans are charged in two separate indictments with committing perjury before the Chatham County grand jury that was hearing the case in what the state contends was part of an attempt to cover up their involvement in the death.\nAll three defendants have pleaded not guilty to all charges.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/Brown_6.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/Ajibade_6.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/Ajibade_6.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/Brown_6.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-12T19:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:05:33.278+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
