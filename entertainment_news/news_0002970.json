More from KSPR.com 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens': What we know \nThe trailer for \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" will make its debut during halftime of ESPN's Monday Night Football game between the Giants and Eagles. After it airs, fans will be able to purchase tickets to the film's December 18 movie theater opening. \nTwo, short teasers have been released, but Disney promised an \"exclusive\" look at the new film Monday night. A Spanish-language version of the trailer will air on ESPN Deportes. \nIt's the first movie addition to the Star Wars franchise in a decade.
