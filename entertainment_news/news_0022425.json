LOUIS — Walks, home runs and Jake Arrieta's 22 victories defined the Cubs during the regular season.\nBut during the final week of the season, manager Joe Maddon prepared his players for critical situations that could determine their fate in the postseason.\nNever did the preparation pay off as handsomely as it did Saturday night when the Cubs relied on a blend of finesse, timely relief pitching and much-welcomed power from Jorge Soler to produce a 6-3 victory over the Cardinals that evened the best-of-five National League Division Series at one game apiece.\n\"We got our guy,\" pitcher Kyle Hendricks said of Arrieta, who will pitch Game 3 for the Cubs on Monday before an energized sellout crowd at Wrigley Field. \"We wanted to give him the ball with the chance to go up 2-1 and hopefully clinch it from there.\"\nAlthough Hendricks didn't earn the victory, he retired 14 of 15 batters after allowing a home run to Matt Carpenter in the first. His success allowed Maddon to employ a well-rested bullpen in timely fashion.\nTravis Wood continued his smooth transition from starter to reliever with 21/3 innings of scoreless ball. Trevor Cahill, who signed a minor-league contract with the Cubs about two months after the Braves released him in June, pitched a scoreless eighth that enabled Hector Rondon to earn the save.\n\"There's a good support system,\" said Cahill, a seven-year veteran in his first playoffs. \"Nobody looks down on each other. Everyone is rooting for each other.\"\nThe Cubs, who started three rookies, looked like the more seasoned team during a five-run second inning in which they executed two bunts that set up three runs.\nThe seeds for the bunts were planted after the Cubs had clinched a playoff berth with one week left in the regular season. The Cubs devoted much of their time normally reserved for batting practice to fundamentals such as bunt defense and bunting practice.\n\"We knew it might come up in these situations,\" said Hendricks, whose bunt scored Austin Jackson and led to a throwing error by Cardinals left-hander Jaime Garcia (who left after two innings because of a stomach virus). \"You have to do the small things in the postseason.\"\nThe Cubs looked extremely sharp despite the fact they didn't take batting practice on the field before the game.\n\"I really believe we go out and play the game that's presented to us,\" backup catcher David Ross said. \"We don't force anything.\"\nAddison Russell followed with another bunt to give the Cubs a 2-1 lead, and Soler capped the rally with a two-run homer that landed on the berm behind the center field fence.\n\"Before I got hurt (oblique pull on Aug. 23), it felt like I was swinging at too many pitches,\" Soler said. \"I've been talking to (hitting consultant) Manny Ramirez and he has helped me out a lot with that.\"\nThere were other little details that paid off. Starlin Castro's hard slide into second base caused Kolten Wong to commit a throwing error that prevented a double play and led to the five runs in the second, and Castro executed a single on a hit-and-run play that set up another run in the third.\nDespite extending his hitless streak to 11 at-bats, third baseman Kris Bryant made two exceptional defensive plays in the ninth, and Russell made a diving stop to take a hit away from Jhonny Peralta in the second.\n\"There were a few nerves,\" Hendricks said. \"If there's not, you're not playing for anything.\"\nmgonzales@tribpub.com\nTwitter @MDGonzales\nPrivacy Policy Copyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Major League Baseball Baseball Chicago Cubs St. Louis Cardinals Kyle Hendricks Jorge Soler Starlin Castro", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5619cfb4/turbine/ct-little-things-pay-off-report-cubs-spt-1011-20151010"], "published": "2015-10-11T05:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:04:00.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
