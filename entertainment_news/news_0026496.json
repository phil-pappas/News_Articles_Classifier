This was a key conclusion of the Future Work/Technology 2050 study published in the \"2015-16 State of the Future.\"\n“In order to make it clear how different futures for work/technology could emerge from today,” says Jerome Glenn, CEO of The Millennium Project, “we will write alternative scenarios and give them to countries around world to develop their own long-term strategies.” The results of these national planning workshops will be complied, compared, and made available to the world for public discussion.\nNational thought leaders and policy makes interested in participating in this process and creating a national planning workshop in their country should contact The Millennium Project. There are Project representatives in over 50 countries to help create the workshops.\n“Ideally, these workshops and their preparation will include key experts from S&T, government, business, academia, NGOs, media, and international organizations who can contribute the diversity of ideas needed to re-think the future economic system in view of the upcoming extend of AI,” says Elizabeth Florescu, Director of Research for The Millennium Project.\nWorld experts are warning about the many dangers that could come from future forms of artificial intelligence, robotics, synthetic biology, drones, 3D printing, and nanotechnology by 2050.\n“However, technologically induced disasters such as massive unemployment, environmental catastrophes, and other large-scale accidents are not inevitable,” says Glenn. “The AI/Robotic future could be an age that releases extraordinary human creativity. Imagine a world by 2050 where those who want could be augmented geniuses inventing their work day every day, with new people, ideas, and experiences to make life worth living, and civilization far better than what we know today.”\nThe Millennium Project is a global participatory think tank connecting 56 Nodes around the world that identify important long-range challenges and strategies, and initiate and conduct foresight studies, workshops, symposiums, and advanced training. Its mission is to improve thinking about the future and make it available through a variety of media for feedback to accumulate wisdom about the future for better decisions today. It produces the annual \"State of the Future\" reports, the \"Futures Research Methodology\" series, the Global Futures Intelligence System (GFIS), and special studies. Over 4,500 futurists, scholars, business planners, and policy makers who work for international organizations, governments, corporations, NGOs, and universities have participated in The Millennium Project’s research, since its inception, in 1992. The Millennium Project was selected among the top ten think tanks in the world for new ideas and paradigms by the 2013 and 2014 University of Pennsylvania’s GoTo Think Tank Index, and 2012 Computerworld Honors Laureate for its contributions to collective intelligence systems.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13033419.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.millennium-project.org/millennium/201516SOF.html", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13033419.htm", "http://www.millennium-project.org/millennium/AI-Work.html"], "published": "2015-10-21T11:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T12:05:15.970+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
