Macaulay will be guest speaker for the next Lincolnville Community Library’s Fall Presentation & Concert series Wednesday, Oct. 21, at 7 p.m. at the library, 208 Main St./routes 173/52. Music for the evening will be provided by Jennifer Armstrong. \nMacaulay grew up on Penobscot Bay’s Seven Hundred Acre Island, traveling weekdays by boat to attend school on the neighboring island of Islesboro. She returned to the island after graduating from the University of Maine, where she majored in art and English. She has lived 61 of her 66 years on her beloved “Acre Island,” where she divides her time between work and traveling to the Great Northern woods where she is compiling information and pictures for her next, soon-to-be-published book. \nArmstrong grew up a member of the “first family of folk” in the Chicago area and was singing before she was talking. By the time she was 14, she was playing fiddle, banjo, guitar and Scottish bagpipe. Since 1977, she has plied her trade as a professional musician and storyteller, performing and teaching around the country and abroad. She has told stories as far away as Hong Kong and has twice been a featured teller at the National Storytelling Festival in Tennessee. In 2000, she moved to Belfast, where she added milking goats and presenting a Pie & Storytelling Festival to her list of fun things to do. \nThe evening begins at 7 p.m. sharp. Advance reserved tickets are $10. To reserve tickets opr for more information, call Rosey Gerry at 975-5432. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
