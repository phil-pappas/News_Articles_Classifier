Alamo Drafthouse apologized for the \"frustration and disappointment\" on Twitter after customers were unable to purchase tickets. \nFandango said on Tuesday it \"experienced unprecedented ticketing demand.\" The company declined to give ticket sales figures for \"The Force Awakens,\" but said it was eight times more than previous record holder, 2011's \"The Hunger Games.\" \nOnline ticketing site MovieTickets.com also declined to give sales figures but said \"The Force Awakens\" was the biggest first-day sales in its history and accounted for 95 percent of tickets sold on the site in the past 24 hours. \nWhile it is rare for tickets to go on sale two months ahead of a film's release, studios will do it for big fan-anticipated films. \nTwitter said there were more than 17,000 tweets per minute when the trailer aired, and more than 1.1 million tweets about the trailer in the 12-hour period after it aired. \nFacebook said 1.3 million people engaged in 2.1 million interactions within the first hour of the trailer release. The trailer has so far garnered more than 13 million views on YouTube and 8.8 million views on Facebook. \nThe two-and-a-half minute trailer was the longest look yet at Walt Disney Co's rebooting of George Lucas' beloved intergalactic franchise. \nIt gave a glimpse of the vast scope and characters the new film will explore, including the return of veterans Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher, as well as newcomers Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Adam Driver. \n(Reporting by Piya Sinha-Roy, editing by Jill Serjeant and Marguerita Choy) A fan holding a Stormtrooper helmet from ''Star Wars'' poses for a photo, in front of five hundred replicas of the Stormtrooper characters at the Juyongguan section of the Great Wall of China during a promotional event for ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' film, on the...
