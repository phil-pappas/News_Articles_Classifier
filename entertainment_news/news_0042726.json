Fun-loving stars gathered for a night of sexy and saucy cabaret to benefit the National Breast Cancer Coalition Fund (NBCC), which is striving to end the disease with its Breast Cancer Deadline 2020 initiative. \nAlways a wickedly funny evening, Les Girls features talented musical stars who are best known for their TV credits. The ultimate crowd-pleaser, Barrett Foa (tech-wiz cutie on NCIS:LA ) belted out “One More Day,” while playing all the roles from Les Miz —but a miscast community theater version. It was hysterical.

Weber also did “I Rise Again” with Ray Garcia and Jeremy Duvall, which was a real rib-tickler. \nLovely Andrea Navedo ( Jane the Virgin ) launched the night with “Diamonds Are A Girl’s Best Friend.” Tracie Thoms ( Cold Case ) was fabulous singing “Fabulous Baby.” Kirsten Vangsness ( Criminal Minds ) did the ultra-perky “Rainbow Dream.” Chris Gorham (of Ugly Betty fame) sang “To Excess,” demonstrating you can be both charming and obsessive. A great song spoof about Kim Davis refusing to issue same-sex marriage licenses was performed by Amy Pietz ( The Office ), Ray Garcia and Brandon Alameda to the tune of “Old Fashion Wedding” from Annie Get Your Gun .

Combining their talents as one big happy family were Spencer Grammer ( Mr. Robinson ), spoofing Miley Cyrus’ “Party in the USA,” plus Peri Gilpin ( Frasier , Mr. Robinson ) and Stevie D. going country with “Islands in the Stream.” Tim Bagley ( Monk ) gave “Killing Me Softly” a sinister spin. Josh Lawson ( House of Lies ) as the Scarecrow, and Brit Shaw ( Nashville ) as a cheerleader, did a clever mash up of “If I only had a Brain” and “Shake It Off.” \nDana Delany ( Body of Proof ) was a suitable hostess since she is a long-time supporter of the cause, “and I played a doctor on TV,” she reminded everyone. But the real stars of the night were the strong women who have made their mark by fighting the disease and helping others. \nThe strong woman behind the NBCC is President Fran Visco who said, “We have this audacious goal, a deadline to end breast cancer by January 1, 2020. We have made progress, but not enough. We still lose more than 40,000 women to breast cancer every year in the U.S., and more than 2.5 million women and men are living with breast cancer here in the U.S. We challenge business as usual and continue our call to action for policymakers, researchers, and advocates.” Stephanie Sperber, Fran Visco, Joyce Brandman (ToddWilliamson/WireImage) \nAnother amazing lady, Joyce Brandman was honored with the Les Girls Leadership Award. She and her husband founded the Saul and Joyce Brandman Breast Center at Cedars-Sinai. A breast cancer survivor herself, Joyce heads the Saul Brandman Foundation, named for her late husband, which supports many worthy causes. During her heartfelt acceptance speech Joyce reported, “It is my mission to have the foundation carryon Saul’s legacy. This is my new life that he gave to me, and every week I work on different charities. I’m blessed that I’m healthy and well, and I strongly support this organization.” \nAlso taking the stage was past honoree, Stephanie Sperber (Universal Partnerships and Licensing president) who proudly proclaimed that she was 50 (shocking) and a cancer survivor. After rallying the patronage, Sperber declared “let’s get this party started,” and lots of cheeky cabaret performances followed. \nStars surrounded by chorus boys and girls on stage at the Avalon Theatre in Hollywood delighted the crowd of generous supporters. And Chaz Bono ended the show strutting and singing “Razzle Dazzle Them,” with gusto for the cause.# \nMARGIE BARRON Margie Barron has written for a wide variety of outlets including Gannett newspapers, Nickelodeon, Tiger Beat and 16 Magazine, Fresh!, Senior Life, Production Update, airline magazines, etc. Margie is also proud to be half of the husband and wife writing team Frank & Margie Barron, who have written together for various entertainment and travel publications for more than 30 years.
