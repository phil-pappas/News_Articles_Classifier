On the 2nd of April 1982 Argentina invaded the Falklands Islands, with the aim of recapturing them through a claim that they had inherited the islands from Spain in the 1800's. \nThe Islands, which had been controlled by Great Britain for nearly 150 years, became a battle ground and the UK government were quick to defend both the Islands and its inhabitants. What was to follow saw the deaths of 655 Argentine Soldiers and 255 British Serviceman. \nAmongst those who were sent to the conflict was Simon. In one of the most horrific moments of the conflict the RFA Sir Galahad was bombed by two Argentine planes, 48 servicemen lost their lives and very few survived. Among these survivors was Simon. This was an event which would change his life forever. \nEventually, and against the odds, Simon escaped the burning and buckled ship but only after suffering 46% burns to his body. Since then he has become one of the most recognised faces of the conflict. \nSimon Weston; My Life, My Story is a truly inspirational show about one manâ€™s journey from the front line of war, being on the edge of death, to today, being a happy and contented father, grandfather and national treasure.
