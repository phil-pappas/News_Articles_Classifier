The 34-year-old singer revealed during an interview on \" Today \" show that she's currently working on a Spanish language record in addition to an English album which she had been talking about. The Spanish language set will be her first since she released \" Mi Reflejo \" in 2000. Her English album, meanwhile, will follow up 2012's \" Lotus \" which debuted and peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard 200 chart. \"I've been loosely working and sort of accumulating ideas for what my next album will be over the last couple of years,\" said the coach of NBC's singing competition series \" The Voice \". \"I'm excited for my fans to finally be getting something from me - it's been a while!\" Talking about inspiration for her new English set, she shared, \"Taking a love for yoga and breathing...not looking at it as an exercise, but just feeling more one with the Earth and everyone being connected, it'll definitely have a reflection on the new record.\" With her two new albums on the way, 2016 is surely going to be a busy year for Christina who welcomed her second child, her first together with fiance Matt Rutler, in August 2014. She's recently also confirmed to return as coach for \"The Voice\" season 10, which will premiere next year. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T10:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:35:23.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
