(Photo by Scott Roth/Invision/AP) Sponsored Links The Associated Press BROOKLYN, N.Y. — \n\"Trap Queen\" rapper Fetty Wap was a bit of a trapped king at a concert Thursday night: The performer, who is recovering from a motorcycle accident, performed sitting from a throne in New York with his foot held up. \nDespite that, Wap was energetic throughout his set at the Powerhouse 2015 concert at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. \nHe apologized for being confined to sitting, and thanked the crowd for supporting him since the accident occurred last month in his hometown of Paterson, New Jersey. \nWap, whose real name is Willie Maxwell, stood up at the end of his performance with two of his friends holding him up. He said he hadn't performed in two months or walked in a month. \n\"I'm a stand up for y'all. I appreciate y'all for having me,\" he said. \nRocker Dave Grohl performed similarly this summer on his Foo Fighters tour after breaking his foot at a show in Sweden. \n\"This (accident) was real scary, you feel me, I ain't going to even lie,\" Wap said. \"If I (mess) up, don't worry about it.\" \nThe rapper has had a breakthrough year with multiple hits, including the pop smash \"Trap Queen.\" His self-titled debut came in at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart earlier this month, and his other Top 10 pop hits include \"679\" and \"My Way.\" \nHe performed those songs — along with another Top 40 hit, \"Again\" — for the feverish crowd, also there to see headliner Kendrick Lamar, Future, Big Sean, Rick Ross and Meek Mill, whose girlfriend Nicki Minaj stood onstage as he performed. \nWap, 24, also offered words of encouragement to the concertgoers who aspire to one day succeed in music. \n\"I swear to God I never thought this (song) would bring me this far,\" he said of \"Trap Queen,\" ''and I say that to say that this (stuff) ain't hard. If you really want to do this (stuff), get up, hit up the studio, and do what you do, man. \n\"If you have that talent, put that work in.\" Copyright The Associated Press Sign up for our WPXI-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter Sign Up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T18:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:44:28.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
