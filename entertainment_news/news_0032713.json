But it just makes no sense to me. Why would I do just one day of shooting on something I did 30 years ago?\" As the Reporter notes, \"nearly all the [other] living actors from the original 1980s films\" are appearing in cameos. Moranis, 62, took an 18-year break from acting (though he has done voice work, radio commercials, comedy albums, and some writing) after his wife died in 1997 so that he could focus on raising his two kids. They're grown now (though he still won't reveal their names), and Moranis says he is \"interested in anything that I would find interesting. ... [But Ghostbusters ] didn't appeal to me.\" He adds, \"It's hard to come up with original material. Occasionally, they get it right or else they wouldn't attempt to do these things. I'm surprised that Disney hasn't done Honey, I Shrunk the Grandkids . But I'm happy with the things I said yes to, and I'm very happy with the many things I've said no to.\" Click for the full interview . (There might be yet another Ghostbusters reboot coming already .) Rick Moranis is shown in a 'Ghostbusters' scene.
