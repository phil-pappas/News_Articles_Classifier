Benchmark's paperless in-court processing was crucial to winning the award.\nDecatur, GA (PRWEB) October 09, 2015\nThe Georgia Technology Authority has announced its highest-ranked candidates for Technology Innovation Showcase 2015. The Showcase is meant to recognize groups in the public sector who have made notable accomplishments in the last year. Among these is DeKalb County Recorder’s Court, awarded for the increases in efficiency brought about by the integration of Benchmark as part of their county court system.\nBenchmark's paperless in-court processing was crucial to winning the award. Before the software was installed, physical files were brought into the courtroom, and the judge marked his or her adjudications on paper. After court was adjourned, all of the paper files had to be sorted through and updated into the computer system, adding countless unnecessary man-hours. All of this post-court work disappeared with Benchmark. Now, with the in-court processing module, a judge can review and adjudicate case files, updating county records right from the bench.\nGeorgia Technology Authority also cited enhanced accessibility for court data. Anyone with a stake in court proceedings now has access to all of their relevant data, right from home. All information they may need is updated in real-time. Through Benchmark Web, court officers have access to outstanding warrants, allowing them to respond more quickly. Those warrant statuses are now linked to case files directly. When a case file is updated, warrants are also issued and modified automatically. On top of all this, access to this data has been expanded to more kinds of court officers than had been possible before.\nThese were just the important highlights of the county’s victory. Unique queues for each department and easy workflow management have helped to reduce user error at every step of the process. The GTA has acknowledged the time efficiency gains, and how they had reduced a nasty citation backlog. The general public is seeing the improvement, too – lines out the door are a thing of the past, thanks to automated kiosks for paying fines. Benchmark continues to deliver award-winning performance for Courts across the country.\nAbout Pioneer Technology Group\nPioneer Technology Group (PTG) is a leading developer of software solutions and services to Governments and the private sector.
