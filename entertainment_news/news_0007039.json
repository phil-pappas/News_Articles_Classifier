Gallaga \nComing up \nJackson Browne with Larry Campbell and Teresa Williams at Bass Concert Hall . Any visit from Browne, one of the quintessential troubadours of rock’s classic era, means a concert for which the bar for songwriting is set pretty high. He’ll no doubt play some of his best-known ’70s tunes, but last year’s “Standing in the Breach” showed Browne remains committed to dovetailing the personal and the political with new material. Equally significant on this bill, however, is the opening duo of Campbell and Williams. 8 p.m. Wednesday. $46.50-$99.50. 2300 Robert Dedman Drive. texasperformingarts.org. — Peter Blackstock \n“Evita.” This Tony Award-winning musical chronicles the life of Eva Perón, the beloved second wife of Argentine president Juan Perón. 7:30 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday and 2:30 p.m. Sunday through Nov. 1. $25-$80.
