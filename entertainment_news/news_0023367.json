You always want what you can’t have right and we don’t have that (Nandos).”\nDerulo, 26, will kick off his national tour at Sydney’s Allphones Arena before playing shows in Melbourne and Brisbane.\nDerulo is not the only one with a love of Nandos with Justin Bieber having this Melbourne Nandos Chicken in South Melbourne shut down so he could grab a feed.

My set will be about an hour and a half and it will be like a roller coaster ride from the top of the show because we go pretty crazy.”\nDerulo is one of the biggest male pop stars of today.\nHe’s sold millions of albums worldwide with hits including It Girl, In My Head, Talk Dirty, Want To Want Me and Wiggle.\nPop Singer Pia Mia forms a part of Derulo’s support performers. Source: YouTube And while Ariana Grande and Rita Ora have recently talked about the double standards of males vs. females in the pop industry, Derulo claims men have it as tough as women.\n“We are constantly compared every single day,” he said. “It is always a competition in other people’s minds. They constantly compare me to other artists, that just comes with the territory. I think it is just an industry thing. I don’t think it is gender specific.”\nDerulo recently made headlines in the US when police were called to his California home when he had a house party. He was issued a fine for excessive noise.\n“It was a little too much,” he said of the police response. “About 50 came, there were helicopters, it was like Project X.”\nJason Derulo performing shirtless at Nova'sRedRoom Global Tour 2:28 Singing sensation Jason Derulo performs with his shirt off at Nova'sRedRoom Global Tour in Sydney's Marquee.\nJuly 31st 2015 3 months ago /video/video.news.com.au/Entertainment/", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent6.video.news.com.au%2FNmdHBsdjodXzbKqS1BDWIiYz5ktbXz2G%2FAZ2ZgMjz0LFGHCPn4xMDoxOjBtO_wVGe&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/1b8196d378545a40b81428ac5c711d9c", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/58a9f52e25dab6d330600d7d55e0c01b?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/7b3fbfd3a70d3d62513318e8561b1d0d?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/99fcba8ae82c8c3a820d363ee6835cce", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/origin:video_integrator.NmdHBsdjodXzbKqS1BDWIiYz5ktbXz2G?t_product=video&t_template=../video/player", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c5cae69f6310b1ac75aa7260fd194394", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b0eb27853091a774fcb6de188930e46b", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/8f3fc487c88364970742ba4bbaf99415", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/273f8d21f4a54f0720388382dc1eee50", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-10-18T13:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T10:09:54.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
