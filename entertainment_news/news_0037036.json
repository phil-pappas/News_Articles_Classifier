Last fall, when his dad died unexpectedly, he decided to create a memorial to Martin Hofstetter, the man who'd raised him \"on old comedy albums\" and the belief that \"no matter how little you have, you always have enough to help someone else.\"\nBuy this photo <div class=\"photocaptionv2\" style=\"margin-top:8px;\" \"> Comedian Brett Druck is a William Paterson graduate. </div> </figcaption> </div> </figure> </div> And so the Martin Grant was born — and the grateful first recipient of the $2,000 award is a Jersey comic named Brett Druck. The William Paterson University graduate works four to five days a week at Trader Joe's in Millburn, does stand-up most nights in comedy clubs in New York City and beyond, and uses his precious free time to work on his social media content or comedy writing.\n\"I use Twitter a lot, and I try to write a new joke every day to keep people entertained,\" Druck says.\nHe is thrilled to have gotten this grant.\n\"It's gonna help me a lot in little ways,\" Druck says. \"There's a lot of things where I am held back in my career because of no financial freedom, and it's going to allow me to do things like afford submission fees to festivals that I wouldn't have been able to budget in … When you submit for a festival, you're not necessarily going to get in, so to spend the $25 or $50 to me is a lot. And then to travel there if I get in is a whole other thing.\"\nDruck's '97 Honda Civic frequently needs repairs, and the grant will help with those fixes, he says. \"And that will allow me to get a lot more paid gigs and move on from there,\" he adds.\nDruck, 29, grew up in South Orange and now lives in Jersey City. He discovered his love for comedy as a student at William Paterson, where he studied communication. \"I was doing a lot of theater in my free time, and in communication, they offered a stand-up class by the American Comedy Institute [as] an exercise in public speaking,\" he says. \"So I did that and I really loved the ability to control the words and the performance. ... I just kind of stuck with it, once I graduated.\" (For a schedule of his comedy shows and clips of his work, go to brettdruck.com.)\nAccording to Hofstetter, a Queens native who now lives in Los Angeles, Druck exemplifies the qualities he was seeking in a Martin Grant recipient.\nFor starters, Druck is \"an extremely funny comedian. … he's thoughtful and intelligent,\" with a great \"understanding of social media's role in today's comedy landscape,\" Hofstetter says. And, despite his packed schedule, he helps comics who are newer to the field.\nBeyond all that, the winner's \"background is inspiring,\" says Hofstetter, noting that Druck has long suffered from cluster headaches, a condition so unbearably painful that they were once referred to as \"suicide headaches.\"\n\"There's no 'Why me?' in him at all,\" Hofstetter says. \"There is just 'Oh, this is something I deal with, and that's OK.' \"\nDruck explains that his cluster headaches are \"episodic,\" generally striking at six-month intervals. Occasionally, he goes into remissions and may skip a bout, but generally, Druck says, \"they come every six months, and it kind of just messes up my life a lot for about two months.\"\nNonetheless, there have only been two shows that the headaches have forced him to \"opt out of completely,\" he says.\nIn its inaugural year, the Martin Grant received close to 1,000 applications, which (with the help of a board of directors) were ultimately whittled down to 20. Each of the top 20 had to submit very short essays answering questions about their career goals, what they would do with the money, why comedy is important and the like.\n\"It was an immensely talented field,\" says Hofstetter, but the Jersey comic was the clear winner. \"We want 20 years from now to look at Brett Druck's being in the position of a Jerry Seinfeld or a Louis C.K. or a Sarah Silverman and say, 'That's a winner of the Martin Grant.' \"\nAs a child, Hofstetter enjoyed listening to comedy albums — especially George Carlin and Dick Gregory — with his dad.\n\"He was thrilled when I decided to pursue stand-up as a career,\" says Hofstetter, who in the summer of 2014 was going out on the road with Gregory for a weeklong tour that would take them from Louisville to Indianapolis. \"And so, I called up my dad and I said, 'I'm flying you out here and we're gonna spend the week with Dick Gregory.' It was an amazing trip. And it was the last time I saw my dad.\"\nOn Sept. 29, 2014, his father died unexpectedly of complications of heart disease.\nHofstetter raised the grant money through donations, selling T-shirts and using his own money for postage and any shortfall.\nIn addition to hosting \"Laughs,\" a comedy series featuring clips \"from the stand-up scene\" that's now in its second season, Hofstetter has running weekly gigs at the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles and the Laugh Factory in Long Beach, Calif. He recently filmed a one-hour special called \"Finding Babe Ruth.\" Slated to air the night before the World Series on Fox Sports One, it explores \"the idea of would Babe Ruth be good if he were playing today?\"\nAnd Hofstetter has already started working on the second Martin Grant.\n</div>", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T12:59:32.857+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
