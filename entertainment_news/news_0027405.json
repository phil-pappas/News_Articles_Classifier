Recently she posted pictures from the Cosmopolitan 50th anniversary captioning it \"Me+1\", where plus one is her yet to be born baby. \nImage Courtesy: Instagram \nKanye West has been asked by a lot of his fans about Kim's due date after she posted the pictures. Kim has spoken about her pregnancy in the promos of the 11th Season of Keeping Up With The Kardashians and seems worried about her health and second pregnancy. \n\"I'm gonna keep it real: For me, pregnancy is the worst experience of my life!LOL! I don't enjoy one moment of it and I don't understand people who enjoy it.\" she wrote in her blog. \nShe also said, \"People just don't tell you all of the gross things that happen during pregnancy or after. Do you know you basically have to wear a diaper for two months afterwards?! LOL! No one told me that! #SoSexy.\" \nThat said, \"it's all SO worth it when you have your precious baby in the end! So for all my complaining, it's 100 percent worth it and more! Maybe it's the swelling the backaches or just the complete mind [expletive] of how your body expands and nothing fits. I just always feel like I'm not in my own skin,\" she explained. \nSince she experienced a lot of mockery for her dressing sense when she was pregnant with North West, she wrote on her blog, \"This time around, I know what I like - plus, I am confident and not trying to hide my bump. I actually want to accentuate it,\" \nImage Courtesy: Instagram \nThe KUWTK fans are waiting to know when and where, Kim's going to deliver Kanye West's child. Rumours hold that she could be having a Christmas baby! She might have a scheduled C-section, and that she's already booked a Deluxe Maternity Suite at Cedars-Sinai. \nWell, well, well. Another addition to the Kardashians' family. A lot's been spoken about Kim and Kanye's yet to be born baby's name and the style Kim's going to use to dress the baby up. So much said and done when the little fellow is still in the womb, waiting to come to the outside world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T10:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:36:04.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
