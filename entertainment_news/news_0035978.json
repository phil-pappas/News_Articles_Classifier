After Washington, it was screened at the Museum of Moving Images in New York and will release worldwide on October 26. \"I hate to see myself on screen but NRIs living abroad and waving the tricolour, deserve to know about the people of India. I didn't know that the documentary would turn out to be charming,\" the internationally acclaimed composer told Mirror.\nThe 48-year-old introvert had initially dismissed the idea of the documentary on him but the persistent, award-winning filmmaker, Umesh Aggarwal, who is directing the project, eventually convinced him to give his nod. One of the reasons for him agreeing to it was that Umesh's film on pesticides in bottled water and soft drinks, The Whistle Blowers, made for Public Service Trust of India (PSBT), won the National Award for Best Investigative Film. \"Umesh told me the film would be screened for consulates all over the world. This kind of exposure was great, but I didn't know how it would happen,\" Rahman recalls.\nHe admits that he's been approached for a biography earlier, but didn't think any of it was necessary. \"After the Oscars, there was a lot of brouhaha and some people thought my journey, the way I make music, would be an inspiration,\" says the two-time Grammy Award winner, matter-of-factly. Jai Ho traces his journey from Chennai to Los Angeles. It has been shot inside his Chennai home, London and the US. It has interviews with actor Aamir Khan, filmmakers like Danny Boyle, Mani Ratnam, Ashutosh Gowariker, Shekhar Kapoor, music legends Gulzar and Alka Yagnik, and composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, among others.\nRatnam admits that it's not a cakewalk working with the `Mozart of Madras', while Shekhar Kapoor points out, \"He goes from Western to Indian and back to Western classic with ease.\" Gulzar jokes that Rahman is the only composer who gets away with adding Maula to every song and Danny Boyle complains, \"He never does anything you ask him to do.\" But Rahman doesn't agree with the Slumdog Millionaire director, \"I always do what the director tells me to, I follow his vision in my own style.\" Rahman says. His association with Ratnam spans a dozen films, beginning with Roja in 1992. Rahman reveals that the filmmaker now no longer feels the need to brief him on a song. \"He loves what I compose, we have a great understanding,\" he says.\nThe four-time National Award winner has filmed a personal account of his interactions as a counter-view, in Jai Ho . On Gulzar, he says, \"He is a great writer and teases me that I add words to give my music a Sufi feel,\" he laughs. Now that he has given a nod to a documentary, is a biopic next?\n\"No!\" he retorts. And what about acting in a film? Rahman admits that he was offered a role in a Hollywood film. \"I've got four acting offers but I don't remember what the roles were about,\" he laughs.\"I'm still young enough to make music but too old for all this. Of course, I am flattered, but I believe that one can't master everything.Music is my passion, my only mission in life.\"\nFor latest Music updates follow us on Twitter >>> @TOIEntertain\nFor the latest in Music news, like us on Facebook >>> TOIEntertain\nFor more interesting Music news and pictures follow us on Pinterest>>> timesofindia\nFor latest Music updates follow us on G+ >>> The Times of India Entertainment\nWATCH: AR Rahman : Doing Pele Film A Big Honour", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain", "https://www.pinterest.com/timesofindia/", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107628521107103264647/+TOIEntertainment/posts", "https://twitter.com/TOIEntertain", "http://gaana.com/search/artists/A%20R%20Rehman", "https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/i0Fzpr3sljo"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T15:39:06.362+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
