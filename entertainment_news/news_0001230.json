New York City police recruits to watch a play for training FILE - In this Dec. 29, 2014 file photo, NYPD police commissioner Bill Bratton stands on stage during a New York Police Academy graduation ceremony in New York. The city’s Police Academy has added the one-act play “Anne & Emmett” by Janet Langhart Cohen to its recruit training this fall. The play is an imaginary conversation between Anne Frank, who died in a Nazi concentration camp, and Emmett Till, who was killed by a racist mob in Mississippi in 1955. The play will be performed for some 1,100 recruits at their academy in Queens over two performances on Thursday, part of a push by the department to prepare future police officers to overcome community mistrust and their own bias.
