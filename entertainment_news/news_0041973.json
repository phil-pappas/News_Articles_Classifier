In the future nearly everything will be connected through smart devices. These rely on built-in cameras or sensors and the data they generate. As a result, Canon predicts that the Internet of Things will largely depend on the 'Imaging of Things.'\nTo deliver new possibilities in the world of imaging, Canon is building a 'Network of Canon Companies' - an ecosystem designed to harness innovation and creative talents from across the regions\nFujio Mitarai , Chairman and CEO, Canon Inc., ahead of his keynote speech at Canon EXPO Paris 2015, commented: \"I am delighted to welcome our valued partners and customers to Paris today and to explain my vision for a future Canon, where both regional independence and international collaboration is put into practice.\"\nIn the new network of companies, each regional headquarters will manage local R&D and manufacturing, as well as service and support customised to its market. Europe will focus on printing and network video surveillance (NVS) and Canon has already brought on board strong leaders in these business areas such as Océ, Axis and Milestone Systems. As a result, in addition to its global reputation for cameras, Canon is now the largest printing and network surveillance system company in the world.\nRokus van Iperen , President and CEO, Canon Europe, Middle East and Africa , added: \"We are excited about the huge opportunities the shifting landscape presents and believe that in the future every image should have a connection with Canon. Whether it is taking the image, recording, storing, editing or printing it we want to play a part and are building businesses to do this.\"\nWhile capitalising on strong positions in its core markets, examples of how Canon is driving future business growth in EMEA include:\nNVS - The combination of Canon, Axis and Milestone brings together complementary technologies and solutions to respond to society's ever-expanding monitoring needs. Ground-breaking new solutions, such as the concept high-sensitivity network camera with ultra-telephoto lens on show at EXPO, demonstrate what's possible for the security market and beyond 3D printing - As a first step in this young but promising market Canon is partnering with 3D Systems in Europe . For customers in manufacturing, architecture, education and engineering sectors, Canon will provide solutions that provide smart alignment between data, imaging capture and output Graphic Arts - Canon is continuing to invest in digital print technologies to be able to cost-effectively print ever-more complex applications on demand. For example, the Océ Colorwave 910 , the fastest digital wide format colour printer on the market will be demonstrating high speed colour poster printing at EXPO B2B solutions and services - Canon's B2B solutions are built to address the needs of specific customer verticals such as financial services, insurance, manufacturing or health. At EXPO, Canon is demonstrating what is possible in areas like document management, data management and marketing communication management with systems such as PRISMAdirect , demonstrating how workflows can be improved to significantly streamline production Digital c onsumer services - Canon is building an ecosystem of products and services for every part of the imaging journey.
