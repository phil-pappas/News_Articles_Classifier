So what does the album of this film has to offer? Continue reading our music review to know. \nFirst of all, this album is blessed with songs of various genres. We have a melodious track in 'Uyir Nadhi Kalangudhae' which has been beautifully crooned by Ravishankar and then we have a folk based dance number titled 'Aaluma Doluma', which carries with it some interesting lyrics by Rokesh. \nWhile 'Veera Vinayaka', which sounds like the first song of the movie, is nice and peppy, 'Don't You Mess With Me' is a hip hop based song with lots of electronic backing. \nBut the baffling factor about the album of Vedalam is that songs like 'Veera Vinayaka' and 'Don't You Mess With Me' sounds as though it has been sung by just Anirudh and Shruti Haasan respectively, though the tracklist claims otherwise. \n'Veera Vinayaka' is supposed to have two voices, that of Anirudh and Vishal Dadlani's. But it sounds like the entire song has been sung by Anirudh alone, for his voice has largely masked Vishal Dadlani's. \nLikewise, 'Don't You Mess With Me' is actually sung by Shruti and Shakthisree Gopalan but we can hardly hear Shakthisree's voice in this particular track. \nContinue to read the story in the slides below : Vedalam Songs: A Detailed Music (Album) Review Of Thala Ajith Starrer 1/8 A Conscious Effort? \nWhen it comes to the song 'Veera Vinayaka', it looks like Anirudh and Vishal Dadlani have sung the song together unlike Kaththi 's 'Aathi Ena Nee' in which we could hear two distinctive voices of Anirudh and Vishal. A conscious attempt perhaps? Vedalam Songs: A Detailed Music (Album) Review Of Thala Ajith Starrer 2/8 'Don't You Mess With Me' \nThough this particular song is racy and fills your head with electronic beats, the after-effects of the song might leave you recollecting 'Stylish Tamilachi' from Arrambam , composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja. Vedalam Songs: A Detailed Music (Album) Review Of Thala Ajith Starrer 3/8 'Aaluma Doluma' \nThere are couple of things that stand out in this song; the way Anirudh has sung it and Rokesh's unique lyrics. Watch out for the crack in Anirudh's voice at certain places in the song. It looks like a conscious effort by the Rockstar. The song also has some amazing beats that will make you dance for its tunes. Vedalam Songs: A Detailed Music (Album) Review Of Thala Ajith Starrer 4/8 'Uyir Nadhi Kalangudhae' \n'Uyir Nadhi Kalangudhae' is a giveaway that points at the sentimental aspect of Vedalam . It also provides a much needed break from all the electronic beats as it has a soothing effect, thereby deserves a place in your playlist. Vedalam Songs: A Detailed Music (Album) Review Of Thala Ajith Starrer 5/8 'The Theri Theme' \nTaking a leaf out from the book of trance music, Anirudh has indeed fabricated a 'theri' theme for the film. This type of theme will especially be loved by Ajith fans when it is played on the big screen.
