Performances will take place Sunday and Oct. 31 in the Samueli Theater. \nThe four performances will include a sign-language interpreted version at 1 p.m. today. For the first time at Segerstrom Center, a “sensory-friendly” presentation will be introduced to the Family Series during the 10 a.m. performance on Oct. 31. \nThe musical tells the story of a kind witch and her cat who encounter a stormy wind that blows the witch’s hat, bow, and wand away. They’re joined by a dog, bird and frog, the group flies together on her broomstick to retrieve her belongings – until her broom snaps in two. \nPuppetry and sing-along songs are presented in the children’s play, which is suitable for ages 3 and up. Playing the role of the witch is actress Amy Harris, who says the musical stays close to the original story, with added parts that encourage audience interaction. \n“This production is a really entertaining, tightly performed show which, when it comes down to it, is just great fun,” Harris said. “If you have little ones, please bring them along. There are some great songs too.” \nSensory-friendly performances accommodate children who are on the autism spectrum or have sensory sensitivity by avoiding loud or startling sounds or bright stage lighting. Other accommodations include leaving some seats open for easier access to move around the theater and keeping the house lights up enough so audience members can see around them. \nAdditionally, the usage of tablets or smartphones will be permitted during the performance for children who use the devices for communication. According to Harris, the audience should not notice a difference between the regular and sensory-friendly performances. \n“We do the same performance regardless of the audience, whether that be families, schools, sensory-friendly, and so on. The performance is designed with everybody in mind and works well whoever is watching,” Harris said. \nSCFTA President Terrence W. Dwyer said the center has been excited to introduce this new accessibility program to the family series. \n“When we heard about these programs instituted in some places, we thought it was essential to provide this service for our community,” Dwyer said. \nOther performances during the series that will present the new accommodations will be “Big Bad Wolf” on March 5 and “Egg” on March 19. Dwyer said the center plans to continue incorporating sensory-friendly showings in the future. \n“This year we are doing the family series, and next year we are doing the family series again, but we are also going to be looking at possibly doing a Broadway show or one of our dance shows,” said Dwyer. “We want to definitely keep doing it and expanding. It takes some effort and coordination, but it’s important.” \nHarris said she is proud to provide all children the opportunity to enjoy theater. \n“I'm really passionate about access to live performances for young people and children; I think theater and storytelling is so important so to be part of something that is accessible to so many children is a real privilege,” she said. \nContact the writer: jmoe@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T14:57:52.865+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
