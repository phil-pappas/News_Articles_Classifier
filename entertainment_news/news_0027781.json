Lundgren, Macy's, Inc. chairman and chief executive officer, in a Friday news release. \"Our vision is to make the store easier and quicker to navigate while also attracting new jobs and economic activity to space that has not been fully utilized in recent years.\"\nThe 265 downtown store employees don't have to worry about losing their jobs, but some may be reassigned as space changes in some departments, the release said.\nThe downtown building first opened at The Bon Marche in 1929 and totals 864,000 square feet of space. The nameplate was changed to Macy's in 2006.\nDaniel DeMay covers Seattle culture, business and transportation for seattlepi.com. He can be reached at 206-448-8362 or danieldemay@seattlepi.com.
