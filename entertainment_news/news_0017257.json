Flawless ... Kate Winslet in a scene from the film The Dressmaker. Universal Pictures Source: Supplied \nBut no one has managed to nail the Aussie accent quite like Kate Winslet . \n“Kate has a very good ear and an incredible depth of soul to not just take on the sounds but also the feeling of being Australian and that’s what marks her out as so special,” says Sydney-based dialect coach Victoria Mielewska . \nProving that her pitch-perfect performance as a religious cult convert in Jane Campion’s 1999 film Holy Smoke was no accident, the 40-year-old English actress is similarly indistinguishable from the “real thing” in upcoming revenge-comedy The Dressmaker , due for release on October 29.

Source: Supplied \nWhile no one is questioning Winslet’s talent or work ethic, the English actress had one crucial advantage over those previously-mentioned actors — Mielewska, whose credits include Top of the Lake and Mad Max: Fury Road . \n“My main aim,” says the dialect coach, “is that we don’t notice the accent at all. \n“Only then do I know I have been successful — because that allows you to sink into the world of the film.” \nStreep, according to Mielewska, made the mistake of trying to imitate Chamberlain. Mistake ... Meryl Streep and Sam Neill in Evil Angels. Source: News Corp Australia \n“It’s a dangerous thing to do because you end up listening to the way someone is speaking. It’s almost like a parody.” \nCumberbatch’s accent is similarly self conscious. \nFor Mielewska, the secret to Strine is all in the “undoing.” \n“Australians are a very relaxed group of people so the actual accent has to be relaxed. You have to let go, you have to relax the energy in the body. \n“The main thing is unlocking what an actor presents with. So you are getting the tongue, the jaw relaxed. You are finding that nice open sound in the mouth rather than closing it down and getting that really twangy Australian sound. \n“You are finding the beauty in the Australian accent — the openness in the vowels, the richness and melody that is in it.” Self conscious ... Benedict Cumberbatch and Daniel Bruhl in The Fifth Estate. Source: AP \nMielewska’s technique is groundbreaking. \n“I know I do it really well because no one has approached it like that before. They have just said: ‘these are the vowels and that’s it.’ But it’s much more than that. It’s about the psychology of the accent. \n“The biggest mistake is thinking that you have got a prescription. You miss everything a good actor stands for — being real, being in the moment, being truthful.” Career redefining ... Elisabeth Moss in Top of the Lake. Source: Supplied \nElisabeth Moss sought out Mielewska’s expertise to master her character’s consciously non-specific Australasian accent in Top of the Lake . \n“I am really proud of that. She is quite New York and she is stereotypically Mad Men ,’’ says Mielewska. \n“She had never done an accent in her life but I shifted her the whole way there. \n“I said: if we can do this, and you have got to trust me, it’s going to catapult you so far from Mad Men that the rest of your life will be open to being seen doing different things.” \nMoss, of course, won a Golden Globe for her performance. World’s apart ... Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron in Mad Max: Fury Road Source: Supplied \nGeorge Miller turned to Mielewska when the dialogue in Fury Road felt jarring. \n“We did nearly the whole film again. Everyone was doing their own accent so it was all over the place. I helped them find another rhythm.” \nMielewska was even hired to help natural born Aussies “perfect” their own accents for Russell Crowe’s The Water Diviner . \nThe explanation for why Australians are able to master the American accent more easily, she says, are two-fold. \n“Exposure plays a part. But also, American is much more muscular. So we are going from a fairly relaxed place a lot of the time to starting to do some gym work for your tongue and getting it really strong.” \nFIVE HITS \nKate Winslet — Holy Smoke Aussie debut ...

But Mielewska was also instrumental in helping Schreiber’s to perfect his Strine accent for PJ Hogan’s semi-autobiographical comedy, starring Toni Collette. Mielewska coached him. \nAlec Baldwin — 30 Rock Last laugh ... Alec Baldwin (L) and Tina Fey in 30 Rock. Source: Supplied \nAlec Baldwin embraced the opportunity to improvise in the Antipodean vernacular with a string of true blue clichés. Adding to the degree of difficulty was the fact that he pulled off the entire sequence with his tongue firmly implanted in his cheek. \nRobert Downey Jr — Tropic Thunder Out on a limb ...
