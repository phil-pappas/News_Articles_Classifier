Photo: Pat Scala \nIndie rock queen Courtney Barnett has teamed with American star Jack White to tackle a controversial song that has become sacred to alternative music fans in recent years, Shivers. \nMolly Meldrum banned the The Boys Next Door's 1979 version - sung by Nick Cave at just 18 and penned by the late cult songwriter Rowland S. Howard  when he was only 16 - because it includes the opening line \"I've been contemplating suicide / but it really doesn't suit my style.\"\nBarnett has received glowing reviews so far, which is no mean feat as Shivers  has variously been a millstone or a totem for anyone involved. The Screaming Jets were pilloried for covering it in 1992, despite doing a creditable job, while Marie Hoy was praised for her version in the movie Dogs in Space , which starred Michael Hutchence.\nNick Cave arrives at the British Academy of Film and Arts awards ceremony at the Royal Opera House in London in 2015. Photo: TOBY MELVILLE \nWhilst it was Howard's most popular and acclaimed song, he said Cave's famously pained delivery departed from the irony he intended when he wrote it. Howard didn't like playing it after that as he considered Cave's Shivers a cover version.\nAdvertisement Similarly the song came to set a template for Nick Cave's gothic stage persona and angst-ridden vocals right at the start of his career.\nIn recent years Spoon's Britt Daniel did a terrific version with his side-project, The Divine Fits. But in general, alternative music fans don't have much time for anything bar versions sung by Cave or Howard.\nRowland S. Howard.
