(Photo: Staff/File) CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nSeven chefs will be exercising their creativity with a harvest basket full of seasonal ingredients for next week's Campfire Social. \nGreenbrier Farms in Easley is putting on a party with food, beer and live music, with proceeds to benefit the Project Host soup kitchen. \nThe dinner, which will be Oct. 29, is the second annual Campfire Social. Last year's event was much simpler, featuring only one restaurant. This year, it's expanded to seven chefs, including Anthony Gray of Bacon Bros. Public House in Greenville, Tobin Simpson of Project Host, Greg McPhee of Restaurant 17, and Mike Davis of Terra in West Columbia. \nOrganizers wanted to broaden the event and \"make it a little bit more like a festival versus a sit-down dinner,\" said Amy Bishop, events and marketing manager for Greenbrier Farms. \nThe chefs will prepare seasonal vegetables and meats from the farm. In addition, an artisanal chocolatier will create the desserts. \nFive breweries, four of them from the Upstate, will offer samples of beer, and bluesman Mac Arnold will provide the music. \nGreenbrier has worked with Project Host in the past, so it just made sense for Project Host to be the beneficiary, Bishop said. \n\"We've donated vegetables to them for their garden that they do every year. We've worked with some of their culinary students, so we just felt like a good fit in terms of choosing them because they do provide food to the community,\" she said. \nThe chefs were told which meats and vegetables the farm would have available, and the rest of the menu was left to their creativity. \n\"They'll all making little sample tasting dishes that people can walk around and try. They can also sample different beers from the breweries. And Mac will be playing music in the barn. We just really wanted to provide kind of a festive atmosphere.\" \nYOU CAN GO \nWhen: 6:30 p.m. Oct. 29 \nWhere: Greenbrier Farms, Easley", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T21:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:29:29.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
