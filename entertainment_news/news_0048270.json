Everything about Bailey Matthews winning child of courage (Daily Mirror/PA) \nChild of Courage winner Bailey Matthews took to the stage and immediately declared that he’d had a late night and his mum had been “out drinking” prompting huge laughs from the assembled celebs.

When everyone learned of van driver Dee Patel’s heroics Wow wow & wow that was like something from a James Bond movie, what a brave man. A true hero, he saved countless lives @PrideOfBritain #pob \n— Gogglebox Scarlett (@ScarlettMoffatt) October 1, 2015 \nHe managed to stop a crash on the M25 by deliberately crashing into a runaway car which was careering across the road. When police arrived they expected to find carnage but no-one was hurt, not even the female driver of the car who had passed out because of a medical condition. And that was thanks to Dee’s quick thinking. 4. When we met the parents of the youngest ever organ donor Pride of Britain story of Teddy heartwrenching I'm in bits .

Teddy became the youngest ever donor in the UK and the family’s stories reduced us viewers to tears not least when they shared how the sound of Teddy’s heartbeat, recorded when Jess was pregnant, has been stitched inside an actual Teddy bear. 5. When we heard Amelia’s story (Daily Mirror/PA) \nYoung Amelia had the nation reaching for the tissues as she explained how she set about fundraising after her brother was diagnosed with a life-threatening brain condition. Months later her father was diagnosed with a tumour and has since past away. \nHaving already raised £25,000, she’s now secured a further £10,000 from sponsor Lidl and £5,000 from Simon Cowell who presented her with her award along with his X Factor colleagues. \nAmelia’s little bro Josh almost stole the show when he turned down a kiss from Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, ducking out of her reach and shouting “no!”. Pride of Britain is getting me so emotional, Amelia's story is such an inspiration❤️👼🏼", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:11:20.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
