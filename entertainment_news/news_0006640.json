Blue Jays right fielder Jose Bautista delivered the game-winning blow in the midst of a 53-minute seventh inning, sparing no mercy while blasting a three-run homer halfway to Mississauga and sparing the deciding game from lingering controversy.\nTexas Rangers reliever Sam Dyson threw his 1-1 fastball hoping it would travel some 55 feet from his outstretched hand to the catcher’s mitt, but Bautista sent it speeding away on a 431-foot detour to Rogers Centre’s second deck for what would be a 6-3 Game 5 victory in the American League Division Series, as Toronto became only the third club in 30 tries to lose the first two Division Series games at home and advance after winning the next three.\n“This was unbelievable,” Blue Jays general manager Alex Anthopolous said through a voice raspy from cheering and behind closed eyes as players interrupted to pour champagne over his head. “That game. I don’t even know where it’s going to rank, but it was just insane. I’m just glad we won.”\nBautista’s blast capitalized on several Rangers defensive failings and negated one of the quirkiest go-ahead tallies in baseball history — on a deflected catcher’s throw to the mound.\nThe resulting confusion and ruling of a Rangers run followed a series of umpire conferences, a replay review, the invocation of obscure Rule 6.03(a)(3), and it incited the Blue Jays to protest and the fans to chant vulgarities and throw debris onto the field.\nFOR THE WIN\nJose Bautista celebrates colossal home run with the most emphatic bat flip of the season\nThe mayhem went from raging antagonism to joyful delirium with Bautista’s swing, after which he stood and watched his home run ball clear the fence before forcefully throwing his bat away from the plate area where an opponent’s bat had inadvertently interfered.\n“We weren’t even thinking about it,” Bautista said of the disputed call. “Obviously it’s upsetting in the moment when it happens, but you try to flush it out of the way and try to get whatever needs to get done to win.”\nBefore the frame was complete, the benches would clear, decibel meters would soar and an intensely ebullient crowd began singing Bautista’s first name to the tune of the old soccer hymn, “Olé Olé Olé.”\nIt all started in the top of the seventh inning when a harmless throw from behind the plate back out to the mound plated the go-ahead run in a sudden-death playoff game.\nAfter a high ball two to Texas Rangers right fielder Shin-Soo Choo in the top of the seventh inning with a 2-2 score, Toronto Blue Jays catcher Russell Martin casually threw the ball back to reliever Aaron Sanchez on the mound.\nChoo happened to be holding his left arm with bat in hand out over the plate as he adjusted his elbow pad when Martin’s throw deflected off the bat and rolled toward third base.\n“The ball hit my hands, and I didn’t know what was going on,” Choo said. “Personally, I didn’t know the rule.”\nTexas’ Rougned Odor, who had been on third, alertly scampered home as home-plate umpire Dale Scott waved time and returned Odor to the base. Rangers manager Jeff Banister then hustled out to confer with Scott.\n“I felt a moment of relief,” Martin said of Odor heading back to third, “then the opposing manager comes out and pleads his case. I guess he could have been a lawyer because he said something to make them change their mind.”\nScott summoned the rest of his crew and then awarded DeShields the plate to make the score 3-2. Martin was given an error.\nThe crowd erupted, many chanting a bovine obscenity and hurling half-filled bottles onto the field, one nearly striking a police officer and another even Martin. Other rubbish chucked from recessed upper section hit fans sitting lower.\nThe Blue Jays all gathered in the middle of the field away from the projectiles as security personnel lined the field. Jays manager John Gibbons argued the call, at which point the umpiring crew initiated a replay review to New York. “I wasn’t really sure what exactly happened,” Gibbons said later. “I still don’t know.”\n“From what I understand,” Anthopolous said, “they did get the rule right.”\nIt was not, the umpires decided, deliberate interference from Choo. Scott later acknowledged an initial mistake on his part before clarifying the rule later. “If there’s no intent, if he’s not out of the box, that throw’s live,” Scott said.\nThe game was delayed for about 10 minutes as umpires sorted through the call, and the litter — from fans throwing objects onto the field — was cleared. Several players motioned with their hands for the crowd to calm down.\nUSA TODAY\nJose Bautista HR caps wild 7th inning for Jays, Rangers\n“To be honest with you, I don’t know the ruling on that play,” Toronto center fielder Kevin Pillar said. “It was one of those weird plays. No one in the dugout, no one in the front office, wanted that to be the reason we were going to lose the game.”\nThe Blue Jays began playing the game under a protest rendered moot in the bottom half of the inning. The first three batters reached on consecutive Rangers errors — two bobbles from shortstop Elvis Andrus and an errant throw by first baseman Mitch Moreland. After one out was recorded, Josh Donaldson flared the ball a little beyond where Odor was stationed at second base. That ball dropped in to score the tying run.\n“This is the toughest time of my career right now,” Andrus said. “I couldn’t make plays I’ve made a hundred times before. I feel like I let down my team, the city. And it hurts. “\n“I feel for them,” Banister said of his fielders. “And, look, one inning won’t define who this ballclub is and who they’ve been all year long.”\nBautista then batted next and delivered his game-changing blow. “Unbelievable,” Martin said. “I want to hug him forever.”\nWhile a few more objects were thrown onto the field — this time in celebration — words were exchanged between the two clubs, leading to a punchless emptying of the benches.\nStarting pitchers Marcus Stroman for Toronto and Cole Hamels for Texas matched each other for six innings, allowing two runs apiece, at which point Stroman departed for Sanchez. Hamels remained in the game and yielded three unearned runs as a result.\nFOR THE WIN\nKevin Pillar adds to his highlight reel with diving catch in Game 5\nToronto’s 20-year-old closer, Roberto Osuna, diffused an eighth-inning jam of two on and one out with two strikeouts and pitched a perfect ninth for a five-out save.\n“Guys stepped up like they’ve done all year,” Gibbons said.\nThe Blue Jays had more than a two-decade wait to return to the postseason since their back-to-back 1992 and 1993 World Series titles, a gap during which time the Montreal Expos relocated to Washington, D.C. — the Jays became the sole franchise left in the country and became Canada’s team.\nAn above-the-fold headline on the front page of The National Post read, “All Eyes on Stroman.” Leading the Toronto Star was the declaration of “Let’s Play Ball!” with a picture of Stroman, covering a quarter of the broadsheet. A widely circulated Twitter meme declared the country of Canada closed at 4:07 p.m. and lasting for nine innings. Toronto city councilor Rob Ford, seated in the first row 90 minutes before that first pitch time, said, “There’s not too many people at city hall right now.”\nNational television ratings surely soared and 49,742 fans crammed into the ballpark, standing for long stretches of the game up to and through the final out where pent-up emotion came bursting out in a final roar — until the next round of the playoffs.\nGALLERY: RANGERS vs. BLUE JAYS WILD GAME 5\nThe Blue Jays advanced to the ALCS for the first time in 22 years with a comeback victory in one of the most bizarre postseason games in memory.
