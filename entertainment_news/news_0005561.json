Roger Barto, 54, was convicted in August on felony charges of insurance fraud, falsifying business records and defrauding the government, and a misdemeanor charge of falsely reporting an incident.\nBarto told police that he was attacked while locking up Waterloo Village Court on Aug. 31, 2013. He claimed he was choked and hit over the head with a toilet tank lid.\nA photo of Barto on the evening of the alleged attack shows him lying on the ground outside the courthouse door surrounded by shards of a white porcelain.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nWaterloo justice convicted of lying about attack\nFormer judge Roger Barto lies on the ground outside Waterloo Village Court in August 2013 after claiming he was hit in the head with a toilet tank lid. (Photo: Seneca County District Attorney's Office)\nMedical evidence presented at trial showed no sign of physical injury. Barto was hospitalized for nine days, but evidence showed he was treated for gout, chronic back pain, high blood pressure and constipation.\nSeneca County District Attorney Barry Porsch alleged Barto concocted the whole story to access prescription painkillers. The county paid $41,500 for his medical care.\nBarto reimbursed the full amount on Tuesday prior to his sentencing, according to the District Attorney's Office.\nA trial date has yet to be set on two other counts Barto faces for allegedly stealing gasoline from the village in April 2014 in his role as sexton of the village cemetery.\nDANDREATTA@Gannett.com\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nAndreatta: Village judges shouldn't be village idiots", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e6fc7c2640102c8ceb46e0107183e05554e59b4c/c=1-0-619-465&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/13/Rochester/Rochester/635803466075525874-Barto.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/13/Rochester/Rochester/635803466075525874-Barto.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8d77ed13c77a1741842a236d672b47e8c9dadd28/c=356-0-1770-1413/local/-/media/Rochester/Rochester/2014/07/26/1406403803000-optiona.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/33955dee37fffaa8b1e70de8c34e0704ccda54c5/c=0-375-4000-2625&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/08/08/Rochester/B9318387324Z.1_20150808142946_000_GI9BIQE9A.1-0.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3d5569507733ca056af5edaf0a2a8036c559fb13/r=500x375/local/-/media/2015/10/13/Rochester/Rochester/635803466075525874-Barto.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-13T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:19:28.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
