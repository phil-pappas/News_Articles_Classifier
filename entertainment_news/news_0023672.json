A legal team repping the Biebs sent a cease and desist letter to the New York Daily News, which was the first outlet to post the photos. \n\"We recently became informed that your company has obtained and is distributing unauthorized photographs of our Client including images showing him without clothing,\" the letter reads, therefore confirming the photos are, in fact, of Bieber, and had not been Photoshopped to look like him, as some had suggested. \nYour guide to American Horror Story: Hotel \nOn Wednesday, the Daily News posted a gallery with a whopping 95 images of Bieber in various states of undress on a hotel balcony. Beauty blogger Jayde Pierce, his alleged girlfriend, is also in some of the photos. \nThe letter asked the photos to be taken down within 12 hours. They are still live as of right now, so do yourself a favor and by no means go look at them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:18:02.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
