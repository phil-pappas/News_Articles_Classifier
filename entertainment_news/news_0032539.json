It's a necessity, a status symbol, and a source of entertainment all in one. Demand for tablet computers and mobile devices will drive this industry's growth in the next five years.\"\n“Technology is advancing at a very fast pace and it is most apparent in the race for the best smart phone,” says Cattya Bella, Executive Vice President for the World Patent Marketing Review Team. “These technological marvels have tons of features that people use every day. Some people use even two phones on a daily basis. However, this can become cumbersome at times. Fortunately, 2 Face is a technological invention that solves this problem by having two phones in one compact package.”\n2 Face is a smart phone which contains two phones in one. With this technological invention, people will no longer have to bring two separate phones. This one phone has two sides and functions as two entirely separate phones. The phone doesn’t have a front side or back side as both sides are touch screen panels that act independently of one another. This is ideal for people who need to carry two phone numbers or have a separate work and personal number. For people who simply want to experience the freedom of having two mobile OS and platforms, this is also a great way to consume media and content.\n“Businessmen and busy people often have dedicated business lines and personal phones,” says inventor Johnathan C. “2 Face saves them the trouble of having to bring a bag or to carry two bulky smart phones on the go. This also means that they are able to communicate and check their emails easily as they always have their phones with them no matter where they go. Simply flip this technological invention over and it’s time for work. Flip it back and you can call the kids while that presentation is downloading on the other side.”\nAnthony Beckham, a sales agent and blogger from Mansfield, OH, has this to say about 2 Face: “People who need to continuously call and contact people for work have it rough. They always need to have their lines open as they never know when a prospective buyer might return a call. 2 Face is a technological invention that ensures that your business line is open while you call your kids or play a quick mobile game. This keeps the business line and personal line separate in theory but physically together for ease of use.”\n2 Face is a technological invention geared towards the busy people in the business world and for tech aficionados that want to experience both sides of the mobile platform.\nABOUT WORLD PATENT MARKETING\nWorld Patent Marketing is an innovation incubator and manufacturer of patented products for inventors and entrepreneurs.
