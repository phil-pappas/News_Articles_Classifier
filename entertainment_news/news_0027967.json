(AP) — Former teen idol David Cassidy has been charged with leaving the scene of an accident and driving with an expired tag after a crash in Florida last month.\nThe Sun Sentinel (http://tinyurl.com/oyqlj59 ) quotes police as saying that the 65-year-old Cassidy sideswiped a truck and then tried to cover his license plate before driving away with a flat tire. The charges were filed Wednesday. Authorities said witnesses identified Cassidy as the driver in a photo lineup.\nCassidy's lawyer, Jason Forman, says the police report is riddled with inconsistencies. He says Cassidy gave police his driver's license and registration before leaving the scene. A hearing has been scheduled for Oct. 27.\nCassidy, who starred in \"The Partridge Family\" television show, lives in Fort Lauderdale. He filed for bankruptcy earlier this year.\n___\nInformation from: Sun Sentinel , http://www.sun-sentinel.com/\nCrime & Justice Society & Culture David Cassidy Sun Sentinel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T13:25:30.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
