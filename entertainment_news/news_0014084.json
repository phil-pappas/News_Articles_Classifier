I don't want to have to talk ... \n\"They gave me one of those things, like a nomination, two or three times. A nomination is plenty. The idea of winning means that you're in competition with someone and I'm not in competition with anybody. I just stick to my guns and do what I want to do. Sometimes people don't like it but that's alright.\" \nMeanwhile, his close friend Alice Cooper previously revealed Depp would prefer to be a rock star than an actor and simply stars in films to \"pay the bills\". \nHe shared: \"He started playing when he was 12 years old. When he first came to Los Angeles he did not come as an actor, he came as a guitar player. He came here with his band and accidentally got discovered, because he looked great and they were looking for a young guy for 21 Jump Street , and there he was. \n\"He calls acting his day job. He said, 'I do so many movies, I crave getting out on stage with a guitar.' He's always been a rocker. He says, 'This was my first love, rock 'n' roll. Acting pays the bills but if you give me a choice, my guitar wins.'\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:52:14.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
