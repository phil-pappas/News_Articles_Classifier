The offbeat and small budget films never made it to screens abroad, while downloading them on Torrent was time-consuming and came with no guarantee of picture quality. However, of late, providers of on-demand Internet streaming media have started to legally release Tamil films for foreign audiences that can be accessed for a subscription fee anywhere, anytime. Most of them are released a few weeks after the theatrical release and in high definition quality and with surround sound. The online streaming is instant and compatible with multiple devices such as ipads, phones and televisions.\nOn Monday , HeroTalkies.com, a provider of on-demand Internet streaming media content that caters to Tamil film audiences abroad, will release `Kuttram Kadithal' (Punishment), three days after its theatrical release in India. The movie was released on the big screens on Thursday and is being made available online much earlier compared to other films as it does not have an overseas theatrical release.\nOfficials at HeroTalkies.com said it was the first time that a Tamil movie would have an almost parallel release online. The film was screened in many international and national film festivals last year. But it caught the interest of the foreign audience after it won the National Award for best Tamil film this year.\n\"Till recently, most viewers were not ready to pay for some thing that was already available through pirated prints. Producers were also sceptical. But today , there is a market. We are able to buy films from producers or overseas film distributors on an outright basis,\" said Pradeep V S, founder and CEO, HeroTalkies.com.\n\"Close to 50% of Tamil films either do not have an overseas release or have a limited release. Small budget films belong to that category and those with good content do not reach foreign audience. We fill that gap,\" said Pradeep.\n`Kuttram Kadithal', which portrays the lives of a set of characters from diverse backgrounds and looks at how an unexpected incident influences their lives, is an independent film directed by Bramma G and produced by JSK Film Corporation. \"My film casts completely new faces. So it is a risk if it is released in overseas screens. I found legal online release a good option. I not only get revenue but can also prevent my film being pirated to some extent,\" said J Sathish Kumar, producer of Kuttram Kadithal.\nA legal online release also provides the producer or the overseas film distributor an additional source of revenue. Pradeep said his HeroTalkies.com was only one of the two websites that offer legally released Tamil films online in high definition quality .\nFans can pay and watch a single movie or subscribe on a monthly or yearly basis and watch as many movies as they want in high-definition quality with a 5.1 surround sound and English subtitles. HeroTalkies.com has earlier released many big budget films.
