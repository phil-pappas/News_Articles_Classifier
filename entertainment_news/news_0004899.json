Toksvig was picked for her mixture of brains and naughtiness.\nAnd that's it from Stephen Fry Photo: qi.com \nVia Twitter, Toksvig said she had massive shoes to fill.\nAdvertisement And today's quite interesting news is that I've been announced as the new presenter of Qi. My dream telly job and I have huge shoes to fill\n— Sandi Toksvig (@sanditoksvig) October 14, 2015  \nNew host of QI: Sandi Toksvig Photo: Supplied \nFry, the polymath, wasn't hired as host of  QI (or Quite Interesting) when the show was first broadcast in 2003. Fry was to be a team captain opposite Alan Davies but stood in for Michael Palin at the last minute, \"just for the pilot [episode]\".\nWhen Palin dropped out altogether, Fry took over.\n\"For 13 years I had one of the best jobs on television,\" he said. \"Behind the camera squadrons of quite extraordinarily brilliant researchers, programme makers and uniquely curious (in both senses of the word) people making that job so much easier.\n\"In front of the camera generations of lively minds and above all of course the wonder of nature that is Alan Davies.\"\nThe brainchild of former Blackadder and Not the Nine O'Clock News producer John Lloyd, QI took a letter of the alphabet to inspire each new series.\nThe next, \"M\", will go to air in Britain on Sunday.\n\"After passing the alphabetical halfway mark I thought it time to move on, but I will never cease to be grateful to John Lloyd for devising  QI  and for everyone else for making it such fun.\"\nThe announcement came as Fry is readying to tour Australia with his show  Telling Tales next month, and it's thought he will concentrate on his own productions.\nFry's career has taken him from the Cambridge Footlights where he met his long time collaborator Hugh Laurie to appearances on  Blackadder ,  Bones ,  V for Vendetta ,  Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows ,  Live Another Day and  The Hobbit  trilogy.\nIn addition to his work in television, radio and journalism, he has written four novels and three volumes of autobiography;  Moab is My Washpot ,  The Fry Chronicles  and  More Fool Me .\nIn 2013 a former senator and the president of Friends of the ABC in Tasmania, bemoaned the frequency with which the British comedian appeared on the ABC.\nPanellist and Jonathan Creek star Alan Davies seems to be staying on despite changes at the top:\nWhat's happening? A Dane you say?We'll all have pastries and jumpers and it'll be shot in black & white. Bye @stephenfry you did very well x\n— Alan Davies (@alandavies1) October 14, 2015 A couple of weeks with a sobbing supply teacher would have been nice but no, a warm welcome to the brilliant @sanditoksvig \n— Alan Davies (@alandavies1) October 14, 2015  \nFry was touched.\nVery touched by all your kind thoughts about QI. Leaving it in the best possible hands.
