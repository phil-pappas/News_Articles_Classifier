On some days a global nuclear war seemed more likely than not. \nWe open on the Brooklyn of 1957, where a seemingly meek man of late middle age quietly goes about his daily routine, which involves painting portraits and, oh yes, working as a mole for the Soviets. In a tightly choreographed and perfectly paced sequence set in the subway system, the man eludes a battery of serious FBI men in serious dark coats and hats — but only temporarily, as it turns out. Eventually they show up at his door, put him in cuffs and turn the place upside down in search of evidence. \nThe man is one Rudolf Abel (played by the British theater actor Mark Rylance in a performance of great subtlety, dignity and droll humor). There’s little doubt Abel’s a Soviet spy, but he will be given a trial, so America can show the world everyone in the United States is entitled to a defense, even an illegal immigrant working to help bring the country to its knees. \nEnter Tom Hanks, in full modern-day Jimmy Stewart mode, as James Donovan, a genial family man and successful insurance attorney who’s almost always the smartest man in the room and doesn’t mind if others in his presence perceive otherwise. Donovan seems an unlikely choice to defend Abel — but he was a prosecutor at Nuremberg, he’s a well-respected legal presence, and he’ll mount a capable defense, even though it will make him one of the most despised men in America and of course there’s zero chance of actually winning the case. \nThe United States government and the great majority of Americans want Abel put to death — but Donovan argues passionately and successfully for an extended prison sentence, arguing Abel could be of great value in case an American soldier/spy is caught by the Soviets and there’s a chance of a prisoner swap. \nWhich is exactly what happens. \nIn a heart-thumping sequence that reminds us Spielberg is one of the godfathers of cool action sequences with cutting-edge effects, American U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers (an excellent Austin Stowell) is blasted out of the skies by a Soviet fighter, ejecting just in time to see his plane explode as he parachutes to safety — and captivity. \nNow the U.S. government has another assignment for civilian attorney James Donovan. They’d like him to go to Berlin, which has recently been split by a concrete wall, and negotiate a trade. \nWe shift from the rain-soaked film noir streets of New York to bleak, snow-blanketed Berlin, where Donovan goes deep into the rabbit hole in a series of increasingly convoluted and sometimes comically bizarre adventures as he attempts to secure a trade of Abel for Powers — along with an American student recently detained by the Germans. (The Coen brothers did an extensive polish on the screenplay, and their handiwork seems most evident in the Berlin scenes.) \nNursing drinks while stating his case with various Soviet and German officials who aren’t even honest about their actual titles, fighting off a cold, Donovan keeps telling everyone he just wants to get this thing done so he can go home and crawl into his own bed. Such fine and measured work from Hanks, who is as good as anyone has ever been at playing men of great integrity and warm hearts who aren’t to be trifled with when the heat is on. Don’t mistake the smile and the friendly handshake for weakness. \nSpielberg and his superb cinematographer Janusz Kaminski deliver some excellent visual callbacks, as when Donovan looks out the window of a train and sees Brooklyn kids climbing fences separating their backyards — and is reminded of the barbed wire-crowned Berlin Wall. The supporting cast, including Amy Ryan as Donovan’s wife and Scott Shepherd as a CIA operative who becomes Donovan’s unofficial partner in espionage, is first-rate. \nHanks will be in the conversation for best actor, Rylance will almost certainly be nominated for best supporting actor, and when the titles of the five-plus films nominated for best picture are announced, it will be a surprise if “Bridge of Spies” doesn’t make the cut. DreamWorks Pictures and Fox 2000 Pictures present a film directed by Steven Spielberg and written byMatt Charman, Ethan Coen and Joel Coen. Running time: 142 minutes.
