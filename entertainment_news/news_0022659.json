Perthverts?\" he said - Brand may want to check his sources on that call.\nIn between his hilarious, crass and sometimes philosophical interpretations of the media and society, Brand made time to stir up some home-town rivalries.\n\"Eagles and the Dockers - now typically one is a bit more bogan than the other I've found,\" he said.\n\"I'm guessing the Eagles is the bogan one from the early shouting [from the crowd].\"The Aussie rules footy, f*cking hell everyone, it's a bit odd that the word rules is in the title when that seems to be the primary thing that is dispensed with, along with sleeves.\"\nJust days after Brand's comments on Prime Minister Malcolm Turnball's Cayman Islands offshore investments made national headlines, the comedian did not hold back during the Perth leg of his Trew World Order show, making several jokes about the country's methamphetamine crisis.\n\"It ain't easy getting into your country,\" he said.\n\"[You're] unduly concerned about fruit getting in...'Have you got any fruit with you? Are you sure you haven't got any fruit?'\n\"Then you arrive and everyone's on meth - you need to reconsider your priorities.\"\nReading from a note scribbled on his hand, Brand also warned the audience about one of Perth's southern suburbs.\n\"Don't go Armadale,\" he said. \"Bit dangerous there huh? Unless you explicitly require meth.\"\nThe night ended with one lucky Perth woman being offered a one-way flight back to England with the actor comedian. Audience member Katie had her phone taken by Brand while he was interacting with the crowd.\nHe later used it on stage to call her mother Ros and thank her \"very warmly\" for his new wife Katie, whose name he joked was \"convenient\" - presumably referring to his ex-wife and pop-star Katy Perry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T05:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:29:11.062+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
