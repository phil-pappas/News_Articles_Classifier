The film, being directed by Swapna Waghmare-Joshi, is also the first Marathi production from Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Shabina Khan .\nWhen contacted, Anjana said, \"It just took a call from the production house and I was on board. I have been educated in Mumbai and am familiar with Marathi. Though I don't speak it that well, everyone on the set here is helping me with it.\"It's been just a few days since the shooting started at Lonavala and the team is tight-lipped about the film's story. \"Yes, it's a love story; an illogical love story for that matter. But beyond that, it's too early to reveal anything,\" informed Swapna, who has earlier directed Swwapnil in 'Mitwaa'.\nInterestingly, it will also be a fresh pairing for Swwapnil's fans who've been seeing him paired with Sai Tamhankar in many of his recent romantic films. \"Anjana and Swwapnil's chemistry is amazing and that's the high point of our film,\" Swapna added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:54:06.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
