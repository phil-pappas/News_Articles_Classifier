The Project Fame South Africa alumnus shared a lovely family portrait which shows him, his wife and kids all wearing broad smiles. He also talked about what his family means to him and he didn’t mince words: “When asked the question, ‘What Makes you happy’, my response is simply – Family. “My family has been such a tremendous support system in my life’s journey. My wonderful wife who has been my backbone of love and support, and who continues to push me to be a better person each day. My kids, who never cease to put a smile in my heart, and who believe that their father is Super Man (still looking for a cape that actually works lol) “I am thankful to have them in my life, and I wake up each day looking forward to being the best husband and dad to my family – More than family, they are my biggest fans! #Naked #DareyNaked #FamilyFirst “ Seen a better family portrait in recent times?
