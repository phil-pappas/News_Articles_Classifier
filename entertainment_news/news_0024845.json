Well you'd be wrong.\nBrewtein, a new product from Supplemental Brewery, is a protein packed beer, but that doesn't mean it'll change any of the above, but it will help you get more protein into you during a night out.\nThe company have enough gone to the trouble of making a light beer, for those concerned about the calories and what not. Judging by the stats, the healthier brew, Nutribeer, gives up 3g of protein and 1% of alcohol per serving, but also misses out on the extra 6g of carbs and 56 calories per bottle too, so it seems like a fair trade.\nWe're expecting to see this stuff on the shelves of your local craft beer shop just as soon as the company gets all the funding they need from their Kickstarter campaign . There's 23 days left for them to gain the remaining $31,500 of the $40,000 they need to produce the drink. So if you want to help out, you know what to do.\nVia Metro\nMORE: Pics: This graph shows just how insanely fit modern rugby players are\nMORE: Doctor claims one in 10 people can orgasm during a gym session\nMORE: 10% of male gym-goers may suffer from 'bigorexia'", "external_links": ["http://metro.co.uk/2015/10/07/someones-created-a-protein-packed-beer-for-gym-bros-who-still-like-to-party-5426556/", "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/konrardy/supplemental-brewing-protein-beer"], "published": "2015-10-07T21:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:43:59.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
