Guy Pearce , who won an Emmy for “Mildred Pierce” in 2011, deserves abundant credit for portraying a onetime defense attorney turned private eye, who in the first season of this Australian-produced series lived through the murder of his wife, Isabel.\nBased on a series of novels set in the city of Melbourne by Peter Temple , this second season, fully titled “Jack Irish: Dead Point,” finds our anguished crime fighter confronted by his late wife’s father, a judge who has uncovered criminal activity and wants Irish to track down a red-bound book, the MacGuffin, as Alfred Hitchcock would call it. And that leads Jack into a dark world of gambling, femme fatales, murder and blackmail.\nOf course, Jack is still being haunted by the death of his wife, and he renews his previously messed-up love affair with a beautiful blonde — a radio journalist portrayed by Marta Dusseldorp , who has been scoring so well in “A Place to Call Home,” another excellent Australian-made TV series. \nThere’s some nice behind-the-scenes bonus footage and subtitles, just in case the Australian accents get a bit heavy. — John Stanley \n\n\nJACK IRISH: \nSET TWO \n2014\nNOT RATED\nACORN MEDIA\n$34.99", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:14:41.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
