Now suddenly this fall, both were gone, off to college. And Megan was feeling sad.\nUntil Day 2, when Megan made a profound discovery.\n“This is the second night in a row I’ve had Cheerios for dinner,” she texted me. “Tonight I’m washing ’em down with a beer.”\nApparently there are indisputable perks in the kid-free zone, among them: Ignoring the Food Pyramid.\nMy friend Abby likewise found herself without children in the house last week when her 19-year-old daughter moved out. Abby missed Emma. She also saw an instantaneous benefit.\n“I could say there’s 33 percent less laundry,” Abby said. “But because she wears four times as many clothes, my percentages would be way off.”\nFor a parent, the dividing line between life with kids in the house and life with no kids in the house is like a railroad crossing bar. You hear the whistle. You see the warning lights. You know the train is coming. But then suddenly the bar is down. And you have to decide. You can sit there fuming at the route that trains — and life — sometimes take. Or you can find a good song on the radio.\nAn informal poll of Facebook pals found a variety of perks and benefits on the kid-free track, including more living space for Kelley when she transferred a two-dog crate from her bedroom to her missing daughter’s. Libby appreciates having the TV to herself. Amanda likes listening to her own music. For Jane, the perks involve kitchenware.\n“When my kids were last home, I thought I was going crazy. I couldn’t find a glass anywhere,” Jane said. “Until I searched their rooms. All my AWOL dishes came back to the kitchen. My kitchen is now filled with glasses, plates and flatware.”\nFor my purposes, I am thrilled with the “no mores.” No more nagging about homework. No more being late to soccer games and praying for equal playing time. No more rushing to the music store with broken cellos or looking for missing bow ties for the orchestra concert that started four minutes ago.\nOf course, there are the not-so-cherished “no mores”: No more seeing my child’s face every day. No more hanging out with my kids’ friends during impromptu gatherings in the kitchen after hours. No more watching up close and personal as my little sunflowers stretch toward the sun.\nBut lest I forget: While they’re off tasting the world without us on the great train-track of life: We get to have cold cereal for dinner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:40:52.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
