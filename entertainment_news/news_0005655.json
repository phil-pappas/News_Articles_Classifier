Their complaint was filed Tuesday in New Mexico Second District Court in Albuquerque. \nKRQE News 13 was first to report the lawsuit late Thursday. \nThe couple's attorney Randi McGinn said Friday that the Motel 6 in Albuquerque where the couple stayed in June is a haven for crime, and unmonitored security cameras give travelers a false sense of security. \nMotel 6 did not immediately return calls for comment. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Daily Reporter, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T23:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:19:12.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
