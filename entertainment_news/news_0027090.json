I was there covering that fateful game for the Tribune.\n\"Paradise Lost,\" the Tribune headline blared the next day.\n\"It's like an empty feeling,\" Cubs manager Jim Frey said in the somber clubhouse. \"It's like we got half a taste of what it was supposed to be like. We didn't get the whole thing. We had it and it just slipped away from us.\"\nCubs general manager Dallas Green added: \"I've never been a good loser. I really feel bad for our guys and all the Chicago fans. We had them by the throat but we just didn't go for the jugular.\"\nThe late Hall of Fame Tribune baseball writer Jerome Holtzman weighed in on first baseman Leon Durham's critical error.\n\"Durham's error was crucial. But it wasn't a blunder that matched the fly ball Hack Wilson lost in the sun in 1929 or Mickey Owen's dropped third strike in 1941,\" Holtzman wrote. \"To say it prevented the Cubs from winning the pennant and qualifying for the World Series would be neither accurate nor fair.\"\nTribune front page following historic sports day in '84 Open link On the Bears' front, the late Steve Daley wrote a Tribune column about Payton's remarkable feat, and his remarkable feet. Payton even received a phone call from the president.\n\"Meanwhile, under a darkening sky, in the rain, in front of 12,000 empty seats and far from the center of attention, Walter Payton toppled a monument,\" Daley wrote. \"The professional football rushing record established by Jim Brown a generation ago was assumed by the Bear running back in the third quarter of a 20-7 victory over the New Orleans Saints.\"\nPayton broke the record on a 6-yard gain after taking a pitch from quarterback Jim McMahon. It was his 2,795th carry in his 10th season with the Bears. He rushed for 154 yards on that day, marking the 59th time he had eclipsed the century mark in his career.\nThe Bears won that game, but most Chicago sports fans felt depressed. So did the Cubs players and Frey when they returned from San Diego to O'Hare Airport. Frey sidled up to outfielder Gary Matthews on the team bus.\n\"Jim had his hands on his knees and he was starting to cry, and I had to turn away from him to keep from crying myself,\" Matthews recalled in his autobiography \"They Call Me Sarge\" (Bonus Books, 1985).\nCenter fielder Bobby Dernier also recalled returning to Chicago after the disappointing loss.\n\"The one thing I'll always remember was the scene of gloom on Monday,\" Dernier said. \"It was like a ghost town. It was like everybody had just died â€¦ together. Like Gary Matthews said: 'Some days the best you can do isn't very good.' \"\nPrivacy Policy Chicago Cubs Walter Payton Chicago Bears National League Championship Series San Diego Padres World Series Cy Young Award", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5618f864/turbine/ct-tribune-front-page-following-historic-sports-day-in-84-20151010", "http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56187baf/turbine/ct-flashback-1984-cubs-payton-spt-1011-20151010", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5618f753/turbine/ct-oct-8-1984-cubs-loss-leads-over-sweetness-record-20151010"], "published": "2015-10-10T14:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T15:53:25.382+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
