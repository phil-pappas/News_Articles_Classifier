Today, the casino owned and operated by the Twentynine Palms Band of Mission Indians is called Spotlight 29. FILE PHOTO , FILE PHOTO Related article » SPOTLIGHT 29 CASINO Opened: 1995\nLocation: Coachella Valley\nOwner: Twentynine Palms Band of Mission Indians\nSize: 250,000 square feet\nSlot Machines: 1,600\nBefore there was Donald Trump the White House candidate, there was the Trump 29 Casino in Coachella.\nThe flamboyant billionaire, real estate and casino mogul lent his name to what is now Spotlight 29 Casino for a three-year stretch in the 2000s. It was part of an arrangement that had Trump’s hotel and casino empire manage the casino owned by the Twentynine Palms Band of Mission Indians.\nTrump came to the Coachella Valley in 2000, shortly after California voters passed Prop. 1A, which allowed Indian tribes to build Las Vegas-style casinos in the Golden State.\nLess than 12 hours after Prop. 1A passed, the tribe, which had 13 members at the time, announced a five-year deal with Trump to transform its casino from a bingo hall and card room into a $60 million luxury resort. Trump’s involvement -- his hotel company’s first California project -- helped secure loans for the expansion.\n“This is intended to be the type of quality resort of facility that you would normally associate with Donald Trump,” tribe attorney Gene Gambale said in April 2000. The tribe agreed to pay Trump 30 percent of the casino’s net revenue, the maximum allowed by Indian gaming laws.\nTrump was hired for “his reputation, his name and his experience,” tribal Chairman Dean Mike told The Press-Enterprise in 2002. “(Trump) is pretty sure of himself. Anything he touches will make money.”\nBy 2002, the finishing touches were being put on a 100,000-square-foot expansion with 30 table games and 1,500 slot machines. Billboards along Interstate 10 announced “Trump 29 Casino: Where the Desert Meets the Donald.”\n“The revamped Trump 29 casino ... is topped by four searchlights that pierce the desert nighttime skies beckoning players to a lofty interior inspired by the desert tones and modern stone touches of Palm Springs architecture of the 1950s and '60s,” The Press-Enterprise reported in 2002.\n“The gaming floor is framed by a ‘faux fire’ wall designed with colored light and steam to resemble a wall of flame. In the center of the room is a sculpted 25-foot tall column of falling water ... As a reminder of the hall's unique patron, an electronic poster of a stern-faced Trump himself admonishes guests to ‘Play to win.’”\nA grand-opening gala for the expansion’s second phase in September 2002 featured an appearance by Trump along with glamorously dressed guests arriving in limos, silver-clad go-go dancers and a Marc Anthony concert.\n“People come because of the name,” Trump told reporters at the event. “We’ve done a very good job and they (the tribe) appreciate it.”\nBut by December 2004, the tribe was looking to get out of its deal with Trump. At the time, Trump’s casinos were in bankruptcy.\n“They want to once and for all take it back and operate it like they did before, putting their own pride back into it,” tribal attorney Gary Kovall was Quote: d as saying.\n“This is not the result of anything that was problematic between the tribe and us,” an executive with Trump’s casino firm told The Press-Enterprise. “It’s just the right time for them to exist on their own.”\nA federal bankruptcy court judge approved the agreement’s dissolution in 2005. The casino went back to its old name, Spotlight 29 and paid Trump $6 million as part of the split.\nEarlier this month, tribal officials did not want to talk about their past relationship with Trump.\n“The tribe has no comment on Donald Trump’s brief management here,” said spokesman Adam Sak.\nContact the writer: 951-368-9547 or jhorseman@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/nwc3i3-b88526221z.120151016152006000g7ncfi2b.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/nwc3i3-b88526221z.120151016152006000g7ncfi2j.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/nwc3i3-b88526221z.120151016152006000g7ncfi2g.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwc3i3-b88526221z.120151016152006000g7ncfi2b.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwc3i3-b88526221z.120151016152006000g7ncfi2g.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwc3i3-b88526221z.120151016152006000g7ncfi2j.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:24:30.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
