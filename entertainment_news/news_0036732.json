Image 16 of 16 San Antonio TV power couple Isis Romero and Phil Anaya share baby news 1 / 16 Back to Gallery San Antonio TV news power couple -- Isis Romero of KSAT and Phil Anaya of KENS -- learned the sex of their second child Friday, and were thrilled with the news.\n“Another boy!” Romero shared in an email.\nThe anchorwoman, who’s 20 weeks pregnant and expects her second child to arrive in late February, added: \"While we would be happy with either gender, we're excited to welcome another son into our family.”\nRomero, who anchors the 10 p.m. news on KSAT, and her husband Anaya, KENS’ weekend anchorman, already are the parents of 1-year-old son Elijah.\nShe’s happy her new baby will grow up “with a brother to play with, laugh with, and learn from. It is such a blessing, and we're looking forward to the special bond our boys will someday have.\"\n\"We're so grateful and blessed that we're having another child, and giving Elijah a brother,” Anaya added. “We've received such an outpouring of support and love from viewers, and appreciate them keeping us in their thoughts during the pregnancy.\"\nRomero said motherhood has changed her. \"I don’t even remember who I was, before my son was born,” she wrote in an email last week.. “Becoming a parent makes your priorities change, and makes your entire direction in life shift course for the better. I’ve experienced such joy in my first year of motherhood, and it’s only the beginning!”\nRomero said in an earlier interview that she and husband Phil “both grew up in a family of six, with three siblings each. “So we knew we wanted to have more children immediately after our son arrived.”\njjakle@express-news.net", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/67/8764915/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/27/61/8748140/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/06/8765883/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/07/8765900/4/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/02/8765620/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/70/8764980/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/13/8766181/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/13/8766175/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/13/8766178/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/07/8765900/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/13/8766181/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/10/8766009/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/13/8766177/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/22/8766633/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/02/8765620/4/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/20/8766485/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/13/8766177/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/27/61/8748140/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/20/8766485/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/67/8764915/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/13/8766175/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/22/8766633/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/13/8766176/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/70/8764980/4/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/67/8764917/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/06/8765883/4/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/13/8766178/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/67/8764917/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/10/8766009/4/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/13/8766176/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-10T02:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:37:48.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
