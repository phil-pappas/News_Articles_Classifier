NBC News is reporting that the Donald will be hosting the November 7th episode, along with musical guest Sia. Here’s hoping they both put on nude bodysuits and recreate the “Elastic Heart” video.\nTrump has hosted the show once before, in 2004, according to NBC News. His opening monologue included a joke about his show The Apprentice : “After just one season, I am about to become the highest-paid television personality in America. And as everyone in this room knows, 'highest-paid' means 'best.'” Nice to know that some things never really change.", "external_links": ["http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/donald-trump-host-snl-november-7-n443726?cid=sm_tw&hootPostID=7d6fcea6c0b39fab44de4bfce805162b", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jh2n5ki0KE,", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWZGAExj-es"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:32:51.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
