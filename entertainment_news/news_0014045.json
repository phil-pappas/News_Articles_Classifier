The actor, who has performed breathtaking scenes in his previous films, was injured while filming a scene in his upcoming film Vedalam, on the last day of the shoot. Ajith reportedly sprained his leg while performing one of the dance moves during patch-up work for a song. Though the director suggested cancelling the shoot for the day, insiders say it was the Billa star who did not want to burden the producer by shooting for one more day, and asked to go ahead with the shoot after an hourâ€™s rest. It may be recalled that Ajith suffered a similar injury on his leg at the same spot during the shooting of a stunt sequence for his earlier flick Aarambam. But we hear all is well with the actor, and he is busy dubbing for the movie. Kollywood Ajith Also Read Nikki Galrani to act opposite Vishnu?
