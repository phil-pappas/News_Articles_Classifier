SPECIAL KELLY QUIMBY Nearly 100 employees of the city of Tybee Island will see their pay increase under a new classification and compensation plan adopted by city officials Thursday. The increases will be retroactive to the start of the fiscal year, July 1. The estimated cost to the city to bring the salaries of the 97 affected employees above the minimum level was just more than $363,000 after factoring in benefits, according to agenda documents.\nTybee officials hired Tallahassee, Fla.-based Evergreen Solutions to conduct the classification and compensation study in March. Mayor Pro Tem Wanda Doyle said the study is the first on the city’s pay structure in about a decade.\nEvergreen representative Nancy Berkley on Thursday presented the council with two options for implementing the study. One would bring the council up to a minimum competitive salary. The other would bring the city up to about midway up the market average.\nTybee council members chose the latter.\nThere will be no immediate additional cost for the current fiscal year, Finance Director Angela Hudson reported. Each department head has already adjusted budgets to absorb the additional expense, she said.\n“I want people to take responsibility for their pay increases. ... We’re a small government. Forty-five percent of our revenues come from hotel fees and from parking,” Hudson said. “For me, I want to take a team approach instead of having to come to (City Council) and pull money out of our fund balance or something like that.”\nFor the years to come, Hudson has recommended eliminating future cost of living adjustments and instead granting pay increases solely on merit. She also suggested the city put aside 10 percent of its revenues each year to fund merit increases and additional class/comp studies, according to city documents.\nThe city could then reassess its compensation scale every few years to determine if another salary increase is needed.\nIn other business:\n• The council approved contracts for the relocation of Georgia Power utilities and for the installation of a shallow well at the site of the forthcoming North Beach restroom pavilion at a combined cost of $14,000.\n• Council members approved a number of budget adjustments which should close out the 2014-2015 fiscal year. Among the changes, the council increased revenues in last year’s hotel-motel tax fund by $71,150. According to the council’s agenda, “the Hotel-Motel Fund had an unprecedented year of collections thanks to employees of the Finance Department, Heather Brown and Claire Price. The city collected a record $2.78 million in hotel-motel taxes and $98,953 in late fees.”", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-08T18:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:59:47.978+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
