(Richard Kendall/BBC/Hat Trick) \nPointless presenter Richard Osman will be one of the two guests in the opening episode. \nThe Have I Got News For You appearance will be Clarkson’s first return to the BBC since his departure, and signals the start of the show’s 50th series. (Steve Brown/BBC/Hat Trick) \nA video teaser for the new series shows Hislop and Merton spoofing Strictly Come Dancing. \nAn excited Merton can be seen practising his “dance moves” and tells the camera he’s on “an emotional rollercoaster”. \nMeanwhile, a bored-looking Hislop thumbs through a newspaper, and says of his dance partner: “He hasn’t got two left feet, he’s got two left arms…” \nClarkson had to pull out of the last series of the satirical panel show following the furore over his fracas with Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon. \nFollowing the incident, Clarkson was suspended by the broadcaster on March 10 before it announced his contract would not be renewed. \nHe and fellow ex-Top Gear presenters James May and Richard Hammond have lined up a big-money move to Amazon for a new motoring show to be broadcast on streaming service, Amazon Prime. (Amazon/PA) Share article \nAfter his previous appearance was cancelled, programme maker Hat Trick issued a statement: “On reflection, Jeremy Clarkson has decided not to host Have I Got News For You. We fully expect him to resume his hosting duties later in the year.” Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T17:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:12:28.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
