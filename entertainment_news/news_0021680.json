And as all those styles generally considered the roots of rock ’n’ roll have prospered across the Atlantic, they’ve also inspired and influenced generations of musicians over there. So it should come as no surprise, really, that one of the year’s most galvanizing Americana acts, Stephen Young and The Union, hail from Ireland. The quintet’s second album, “Eagle Fort Rumble” won’t be released in the United States until next month, but they’re doing a two-week tour to introduce themselves, including a show on October 27 at Atwood’s Tavern in Cambridge. Young admits that the first CD released under his name a few years ago, “Wilderness Machine,” was “more singer-songwriter-with-a-band” sounding than the real rock band sound of the new album. But the latest disc didn’t come without its own back story, beginning in 2012, when the quintet locked themselves away in a log cabin studio in rural Tipperary for six weeks of recording. The sessions weren’t always efficient or copacetic. One band member was replaced before the whole process was done. But even after the recording concluded, the final mixes were not exactly what was wanted, so Dublin producer Larry Hogan spent more months helping the band boil down the music to the essentials. The results have proven that all that extra effort was worth it, as Radio Nova has called them “The best Americana band this side of the Atlantic,” and the single “Duty Free 200” was selected as a Today FM Single of the Week back earlier this month. There are various elements spinning through the album, but most listeners would consider the music to be country-rock, with some folk-rock aspects. “Shiver” for example, is an amiably chugging bit of country-rock, while “Monsoon Season” is a sweeping, full band performance that elevates the country-rock to arena dynamics. The single “Duty Free 200” is a haunting, wistful and deeply poignant ballad with the instantly indelible chorus “your love is a like a cigarette, it just burned down.” But there’s also a 1960’s feel to tunes like “The Blind Leading the Blind,” where banjo plinking fuels a dreamy canter of a song. “Shadowman” absolutely feels as if the tale is being told through a foggy night, with a hypnotic piano figure floating around it all. The most rocking tune would be “Shuffle (In the Quicksand),” which carries as much roadhouse grit as any Z.Z. Top, but the sparse piano and vocal treatment of the eerie ballad “Someone You Dream Of” is equally powerful. And how can anyone classify “Teardrops,” where there seems to be three separate rhythms going on amid a spooky, otherworldy vibe? Before the band embarked for America, we conducted an email interview with Young, and started off by asking him, since most of his U.S. audience will hear his music as country-rock or Americana, is that reflected what dominated his own youthful listening. YOUNG: Roots music in general is what I listened to from my late teens on. I was blessed with the guidance I had really. My English teacher in school was a guy by the name of Tommy Halferty and he really set a few of us right when it came to music. As teenagers we were listening to Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Sonic Youth and bands like that. He used to let us use his room to jam in at lunchtimes and he would come and say “well what you’re playing there is fine but have a listen to this...” and he would play a CD, or pick up the guitar himself, and play anything from Charlie Parker to BB King to Van Morrison. Tommy was a world famous jazz guitarist at that time, and still is. He’s Bill Clinton’s favorite jazz guitarist, a fact that just blew our minds. But here he was nine months of the year teaching us English and by way of sheer luck, music. I learned a lot from him, particularly a love for the blues. So I spent a whole lot of time in my 20s delving into that and from there into country and bluegrass and beyond. We asked Young about his lyric style, which can be raw but is also poetic, impressionistic, and yet thoroughly accessible. I was reminded at spots of Tim Hardin and/or Leonard Cohen. Were those people Young had listened to? Did it take a while to find his most comfortable writing style? YOUNG: Lyrically I was always ready to jump in at the deep end, but what took time for me was learning how much of myself I wanted to give away. Songwriting’s a very personal thing and often the best writing comes from a very personal place. I tried a neat balancing act on this record where I would give melody just as much thought and reverence as I did the lyrics... Some of the songs on this album, I dug as deep as I would allow myself to go but then once I got there sometimes I didn’t like what I saw so turned around a little bit and sat down there. On something like ‘Shiver,’ I really let everything out there, that was like an exorcism in my kitchen with a guitar and a laptop. But then on other songs I really wanted to keep it light, keep to the point, and just write a straight-up love song and not get in the way of myself. A big advantage to this album is how clean it sounds – never overproduced, or cluttered up. So we asked Young if that kind of approach was something that he sought for on his first recordings, and something that evolved as he gained more studio experience? YOUNG: That sound came from a process of elimination to be honest. The big, Irish mess that was the recording process for this album meant that this set of songs really only took shape in the final couple of months before we signed off on the masters. We had spent six weeks alone in a log cabin in rural Ireland recording the basic tracks. It was beautiful setting, really perfect. We were isolated on the side of a mountain overlooking Lough Derg, we’d brought all the recording equipment to the house and thought “what could go wrong?” It was nightmare in them early sessions. The over-indulgence and late nights, parties and everything that went on led to very very little work being done and remainder of the recording process went much the same way. And if it wasn’t us that got in our own way it was dirty electricity from a farmer’s electric fence causing a ‘crackle’ in the amps – stopping any chance of tracking guitars. Even after leaving the house there was just endless problems in production that led to the early drafts of the songs sounding very different to how they are now – cluttered and over-produced. It wasn’t until we went to Larry Hogan, a very good producer in Dublin, did the album start to sound the way it sounds now. Myself, Larry and Johnny, our drummer, sat down and started stripping things back and losing all the frills until it sounded like a band in a room again and once we had that we left it there. “Shadowman” manages to evoke sonic images of haze and fogginess, and the piano is especially cool – how did that arrangement come about? YOUNG: I wanted to get across that feeling of internal and external rage and with the piano giving it all a sort of floaty lightheadedness. The song is about two friends of mine who were having difficulties with alcohol and drugs. It’s one of those things where we didn’t want to get in the way of the lyric in verses too much, so Johnny kept the drums quite sparse until that big kick, Shayne has this great eerie slide guitar that I love and Kenny on the keys just tinkling around brightens up the dark tone of the piece but as well as that I can hear The Doors or Pink Floyd in his part – they’re two bands he loves – so I’m sure he’s pretty proud of that piano line. There seem to be about three separate rhythms running through “Teardrops” and yet it all works in a spooky, otherworldly way. What was the inspiration for that and how difficult was it to bring it to fruition in the studio? YOUNG: That’s all Shayne. ‘Teardrops’ is his baby. The original demo for that was kind of a Willard Grant Conspiracy type feel. Just me playing a very simple guitar part, Kenny and the guitar playing the same run-down alongside each other then the drums and bass. Shayne wasn’t a huge fan of the original and had his own vision for how it could work and sound more interesting. I didn’t have anything to do with it besides writing the basic chord structure and singing the thing. Not that I minded ... I mean it was just funny for me to finish my part on a song and come back a few months later and hear something completely different to how I’d left it. It took a little while for me to get used to it. Johnny and Shayne were huge fans of it. Johnny loves his 80s sounds and Shayne enjoys electro and sounds like that so I was like “well I’m not gonna throw my toys out of the pram here just because I wasn’t involved in this song right the way through – and thoroughly invested in it – so if the boys like it, so be it.” We asked if Young feels his songwriting, and his basic sound, have developed and evolved since he began playing professionally? YOUNG: My writing has developed in terms of what my goal is when I sit down to write a song now. Lyric was the most important thing in the early days when I was sitting in my first apartment, having friends over and playing Dylan from 10 p.m. til 3 a.m. A lot of my early recordings where straight-up rip-offs – sounding a lot cleverer than I was! After a while, and I can’t really pinpoint the turnaround, but melody and hooks became just as important. I spent a while thinking “if I can combine the two of these then I’ll make something good!” Throughout writing this album, and now while I’m writing my next one, I’m still very comfortable writing a lyric but always striving to nail a melody. So much so, that I’d almost stopped writing lyrics just to focus on finding a catchy hook, because I knew the lyrics would be there for me when I went looking for them. This is something I’m still working on. If I master it, I may retire. Finally, we wondered if Young and the Union have played much in the United States, and specifically the Northeast, before this, and what types of venues they usually perform in? YOUNG: I’ve been to the States before but not with work, so I’m very much looking forward to this tour. Because I work mostly with the band these days I do play a lot of rock clubs and I do enjoy that. It’s great to open up a crowd, get them on your side and hopefully get them dancing and enjoying themselves. It’s been a while since I’ve played solo, probably 3 or 4 years since I’ve played a whole set by myself with a guitar, so I’ve had to knock the rust off the last couple of weeks but I can’t wait to get started. It’s a different type of show entirely. I enjoy the quiet gig. It’s just me and a guitar and some pairs of ears.” STEPHEN YOUNG AND THE UNION - 9:45 p.m., Tuesday at Atwood’s Tavern, 877 Cambridge St., Cambridge; $7. atwoodstavern.com , or 617-864-2797.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:28:41.091+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
