Enlarge... \nNorthport — Eager for substantive change in who next occupies the Oval Office, a volunteer team of Midcoast residents is planning an evening of fundraising fun and great music for Friday, Oct. 30, in support of their favorite presidential candidate, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. \nThe Bernie Sanders’ Blue Goose Bash will run from 6 to 11 p.m. at the Blue Goose Event Center on Route 1. Event organizers hope to attract a capacity crowd of approximately 300 to 400 supporters and will not be surprised if many of them arrive in costume, given the event is held the night before Halloween. \nMusic will be provided by local group People of Earth, who play rock, new wave, reggae, Latin and funk originals and covers. There will be dancing, and hot cider, coffee and other light refreshments will be available. In addition, the public is invited to bring ready-to-eat snacks and potluck finger foods for sharing with other guests. \nSuggested entrance donation is $25 per person, with all proceeds going to support Sanders' presidential election campaign. A limited number of advance tickets are available online at midcoastfriendsofbernie.com ; the remainder will be available at the door. \nWhile organizers emphasize that the primary purpose of the event is to raise funds for Sanders’ 2016 presidential election campaign, it also is an attempt to build community and raise awareness among local voters. There will be information on hand about the Maine voter registration process for people looking to vote for the first time or to update their residency or party affiliation. Also, during one of the band’s intermissions, there will be a brief presentation about the Maine caucus system, how it works and how Maine people can participate in it. \nAmong other planned activities that night are a penny social and the opportunity for guests to pose for a photograph with Sen. Sanders … or at least with a life-size cardboard cutout of him. \nBernie Sanders' Blue Goose Bash is sponsored by the local grassroots group Midcoast Friends of Bernie.
