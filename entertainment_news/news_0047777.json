The studio has acquired the rights to develop the book series by Patric Rothfuss into a movie, a TV series and a video game. The books center on a strong character named Kvothe who possesses a variety of skills that include musical mastery, lockpicking, magic, swordsmanship, hand-to-hand combat, and survival skills. The first two books have sold 10 million copies around the world and the third one is expected to be released next year. 20th Century Fox and New Regency Productions actually had been developing a \"Kingkiller\" TV series two years ago. Rothfuss later met with other studios such as Warner Bros. and MGM at Comic-Con, before striking a deal with Lionsgate. The studio described \"Kingkillers\" as the best-selling fantasy behind \" Game of Thrones \". Robert Lawrence is producing. The movie will be Lionsgate Motion Picture Group Co-President Erik Feig and creative executives Jeyun Choi Munford and Jessica Switch's field of work. The TV adaptation is under Lionsgate Executive Vice President of Television Chris Selak's responsibility while the video game will be developed by Lionsgate President of Interactive Ventures and Games Peter Levin. \"Pat Rothfuss's imaginative storytelling, the spellbinding character Kvothe and the vivid world of Temerant in 'The Kingkiller Chronicle' series have a passionate and savvy fanbase and the potential to reach an even broader audience in adaptation,\" Feig said in a statement. \"It is rare that a property comes along with a world so rich and multilayered that it lends itself to exploration across film, television and video game audiences at the same time.\" Rothfuss was happy that the deal included multiple platforms. \"That will give us the screen time to develop the characters and show off the world,\" he said in a statement. \"What's more, through this whole process, they've treated me with amazing respect. I never thought a studio would approach me as a creative partner who understands how stories work.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 Leave a Comment Required fields are marked with *", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:35:24.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
