Mason will replace Tom Bleasby who withdrew from the competition a few days ago. The return of the controversial singer is a bit of a shock considering he was almost removed from the stage during the six chair challenge after ranting at Simon Cowell about his lack of screentime during the original auditions stage. \nViewers saw Mason launch into an attack on Simon before refusing to apologise for his behaviour or remarks. The judges were visibly shocked, especially as Mason had given a really strong audition that likely would have resulted in him getting a seat. \nThe decision to bring Mason back seems to be a bid by producers to bump up the showâ€™s poor ratings. Surely Nick should have chosen to bring back Ollie Marland, Nathanael Landskroner, Papasidero or Jamie Eldridge, all of whom were originally given chairs before being swapped out for other contestants. \nThe X Factor 2015 continues on Sunday at 7pm on ITV.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T11:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:40:04.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
