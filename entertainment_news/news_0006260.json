She was arrested based on the complaint of Vadodara-based travel agency La-Raib Tours.Susairaj had allegedly promised the agency air tickets for 1,200 Haj pilgrims through her Mumbai firm. However, she failed to produce the tickets, the complaint stated.\nSusairaj, meanwhile, has claimed that she is being victimised for helping her friend.Speaking to Mirror, the starlet said the prime accused in the case, Paromita Chakraborty, was a friend she was meeting after a long time. \"Since I had not seen Vadodara before, I decided to accompany her to a business trip there last year,\" she said, alleging that a former television journalist identified as Iqbal had threatened her lawyer in Ahmedabad, when she went there to meet her lawyer to get the matter quashed.\nMaria reportedly met Pa romita during her stay at the Byculla Jail where they struck a friendship.\nAhmedabad Detection of Crime Branch initiated action against the struggling actress based on a complaint filed in Vadodara on June 6, 2015, by Zaid Ashfaq, owner of La-Raib Tours and Travels located in Panigate area of Vadodara. In the complaint, filed under IPC Sections 406, 420, 467, 468, 120B, and 114, Ashfaq stated that he had been cheated by Maria Susairaj and partner Paromita Chakraborty and swindled of an amount of Rs 2.11 crore. Zaid and his son had met the two women at Hotel Royal Orchid in Vadodara where the women introduced themselves as directors of Parapan Group Tours and Travels Company from Powai, Mumbai.\n\"Maria Susairaj and Paromita had been evading arrest since June 6. We were trying to find Paromita based on her phone number which was hot listed for tracking. When we found her number active in Naroda, we raided bungalow number A33 where she was likely to meet advocate Rajkumar Chaumal in connection with the anticipatory bail in Gujarat High Court for the same case. A team of DCB headed by Police Inspector V J Rathod reached Chaumal's bungalow for Paromita and instead found Maria Susairaj,\" said Rahul Patel, Assistant Commissioner of Police (Cyber Cell, DCB), confirming that the actress, convicted in the Neeraj Grover murder case, had reached Vadodara at around 5 pm on Thursday.Paromita, however, is still absconding, said cops.\nThe police observed that for an innocent bystander caught in the so-called circumstantial situation, Maria seemed to be very collected when speaking with DCB officials. \"Arguing about legalities with the crime branch team at Chaumal's residence, Maria asked for female officers, stating she could not be arrested at night if female officers were not present.However, when shown the arrest warrant, she clammed up and was taken to the DCB's office at Gaekwad Haveli. There were women officers and constables present with the team,\" a source from the DCB said on condition of anonymity.\nThe source added that Maria did not cooperate while giving her statement and claimed to be unaware of the developments in the case filed against her at Vadodara. \"When quizzed about her legal knowledge, Maria said that she was familiar with law and its proceedings after her three-year stint in jail,\" the source added.\nAs per the FIR filed by Zaid Ashfaq (a copy of which is with Mirror), Maria reportedly lured Ashfaq into given them a huge commission on Haj tour package. Hooked, Zaid went to Mumbai to meet the two women again and struck a deal for 1,200 tickets for Haj pilgrims from Vadodara. \"Susairaj charged Rs 17,500 to Rs 18,000 per ticket and handed over the list of tickets booked to us following which, we made the payment. However, three days before the date of travel, Susairaj cancelled all tickets and transferred Rs 2.11 crore into her personal account. The matter came to light when the Haj victims realised the PNR numbers and copies of the ticket were fake and we faced a loss of around Rs 2.68 crore,\" the FIR reads.\nWhen Zaid confronted the duo, Susairaj handed him a cheque of Rs 80 lakh. But the cheque bounced, following which Zaid filed a complaint with DCB Vadodara.\nOn June 6, Susairaj and others approached the Gujarat High Court seeking to quash the FIR claims. Justice Abhilasha Kumari, who heard their quashing plea and rejected it, granting relief to Susairaj, ordering the DCB not to arrest the actress during investigation. However, Susairaj reportedly approached the Vadodara Sessions Court in September seeking an anticipatory bail that was rejected, prompting her to approach the HC. She last approached the HC on Wednesday in the court of Justice JB Pardiwala who rejected her plea for anticipatory bail.\nMaria, who was jailed for three years till 2011 for help in destroying evidence during the trial of Neeraj Grover murder case, is a resident of Banimantap, Hanumantnagar in Mysuru.\n`Maria is the brainchild behind fraud'\nZaid Ashfaq, the travel agent who filed the complaint that led to the arrest of Maria Susairaj, claims the fraud was Maria's brainchild. Ashfaq, who runs La-Raib Tours in Panigate area of Vadodara, claims Maria was not accompanying a friend as claimed by her. She claimed to be one of the directors and met me at their Mumbai office, said Ashfaq.\nZaid said, \"I was introduced to Paromita Chakraborty through a common friend.\"\nThen, Paromita and Maria met me sometime in July last year, following which we met at Royal Orchid where Maria and Paromita told me about their travel companies -Parapan and Marigold Overseas Private Limited in Mumbai. They also explained about their plan of making huge profits by offering bulk tickets to Haj pilgrims. Following this, we went to Mumbai and struck a deal for 1,200 such tickets for Haj pilgrims from Vadodara. In this regard, I also transferred money online into the companies' account,\" said Ashfaq.\n\"In December 2014, when the group of Haj pilgrims reached Mumbai, they were informed that the tickets were cancelled. The PNR numbers and copies of the ticket sent on WhatsApp turned out to be fake. The entire loss was to the tune of around Rs 2.68 crore. I immediately called up the duo and went to meet them at their Mumbai office. On meeting Paromita and Maria, the latter showed us their cards as direc tors of the company. They also showed me demand drafts as proof of transactions to the tune of Rs 10 crore. They claimed they were not frauds and that our money was safe,\" said Ashfaq, adding, \"This fraud was Maria brainchild.\"\nSpeaking further, Ashfaq said, \"In February 6 this year, I filed a written complaint with Crime Branch, Vadodara. Following the complaint, Suraj Jaiswal -claiming to be Paromita's brother and a partner of the group -struck a negotiation and signed two MoUs with me. He also gave me cheques from his private account.However, as all those cheques bounced, I filed another complaint in June this year which resulted in Jaiswal's arrest by the Crime Branch, Vadodara. I hope the culprits are not spared.\"\n`I WAS HELPING A FRIEND'\nWearing a studded royal blue top and jeans, Maria Susairaj would have cut a pretty picture. However, her red-rimmed eyes drew everyone's eye. Proclaiming her innocence, she said, \"I have been wrongly framed. I was victimised for helping my friend.\"\nShe said, \"My friend Paromita Chakraborty was on her way to Vadodara for a business trip last year. Since I had not seen the city before, I decided to accompany her. My friend met complainant Zaid Ashfaq in a hotel in Vadodara. She also introduced me to him. I met the complainant for the first and last time there. The complainant never sent a single rupee or made calls or sent messages to me. I have been wrongly named in this case.\"\nMaria also alleged that ex-journalist Iqbal had repeatedly threatened her lawyer in Ahmedabad, when she went there to meet her lawyer to get the matter quashed.It is reported that the journalist had a hand in fixing the Haj ticket deal. \"There were problems with the deal. The falling out led to a fight between the journalist and Paromita. I rushed her to the hospital and suddenly found that I had been named a witness in that case. I had nothing to do with the incident. I was living with my parents in Bangalore where I got a diploma in banking.I met Paromita by chance in Mumbai and we became good friends. However, it has been a long time, since we talked to each other.\"\n(With inputs from Ojas Mehta, Hiren Upadhyay and Sunil Mohanty)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:22:42.283+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
