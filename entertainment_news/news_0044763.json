It also saw its fair share of drama (thanks to Len), and the highest score of the series so far!Naturally, Twitter had a lot to say, and so Digital Spy rounded up the best reactions of the evening for your pleasure. Enjoy! © BBC / Guy LevyAinsley Harriott and Natalie Lowe The opening number, being movie week, was naturally theatrical:You'd have to be a dried up piece of crust not to LOVE #Strictly's wonderful opening to Movie Week. Either that or a Daily Mail reader.— Lorna Cooper (@Coops_tv) October 10, 2015Just as well Iwan left. Don't think I could have coped with a rhumba to Chariots of Fire #SCD— Lily Tomlinson (@lilyvtomlinson) October 10, 2015How FAB-U-LOUS was dat opening number on #Strictly— Rose (@MsRoseCavalier) October 10, 2015The VTs started to get on peoples' nerves slightly:Just once I'd like a celebrity to go, \"I wish we had more time to train, but we had to shoot a silly VT instead\" #Strictly— Elliot Gonzalez (@elliot_gonzalez) October 10, 2015Anyone else think they'd enjoy this show a bit more without the inane video clips?#Strictly— Emma Salters Austin (@emmajaustin) October 10, 2015If they spent less time doing the crap skits for the VT & more time practicing they maybe able to dance better #Strictly— Anna Pickering (@ban_anna_) October 10, 2015Can't work out if the Strictly Vt's are hilarious or if they want me to throw the TV out of the window & then set fire to the living room— Matt Johnson (@Mattjohnsons) October 3, 2015Len snapped at Giovanni, and it DID NOT go down too well:\"That was awful and not even slightly a rumba. You've angered me and I will mark you harshly\" in Len Goodman terms this means a 6. #strictly— Mzebonga (@Mzebonga) October 10, 2015Len was a bit out of order there....just basically gave a work colleague a bollocking on national tv. Bit uncalled for #Strictly x— Gemma (@Gxmma_Paulette) October 10, 2015Absolutely no time for Len's disrespectful, cranky outbursts. He never fails to show his true colours each year. It's not on. #SCD #strictly— Emma Hynes (@ELHynes) October 10, 2015Len Goodman getting Medieval with Giovanni #strictly— John Turner (@JaunePeril) October 10, 2015Did Giovanni run over Len's dog? #Strictly— Strictly Dancers (@strictlydancers) October 10, 2015Len Goodman that was aggressive, bullish and rude!! If you have an issue take it aside. Out of order. Not relaxing TV. #strictly #giovanni— Jade Haunting (@jadewritesbooks) October 10, 2015However, it was all about the dancing and one of the first routines was by boxer Anthony Ogogo and Oti Mabuse set to quite a familiar tune:I'm watching Strictly for the first time this series. A professional boxer dancing to Eye Of The Tiger. pic.twitter.com/5D8iwejzTS— Pete Allison (@Pete_Allison) October 10, 2015Anthony dancing to Eye of the Tiger with a boxing theme? You'd think he was a boxer at this rate! #Strictly— Anna Dunne (@Awerka) October 10, 2015Olympics to dancing to 'Eye of the Tiger' in three years. #OlympicLegacy #Strictly— Matt.Spurs (@MattISpurs) October 10, 2015 © BBC / Guy Levy Kellie Bright and Kevin Clifton's Star Wars routine got a rather mixed reaction on Twitter:I felt a great disturbance in the Force, millions of voices cried out in terror & were suddenly silenced #strictly pic.twitter.com/4lnZmlvva3— Simon Alexander (@simon_alexander) October 10, 2015The Star Wars dance happening on #Strictly right now is a thing of demented hilarity. Luke & Leia are dancing to the Cantina band.— Helen O'Hara (@HelenLOHara) October 10, 2015just seen that on #Strictly they are doing a routine to the star wars cantina song. Its almost as sacrilegious as jar jar binks...— stellacreasy (@stellacreasy) October 10, 2015Oh my god. Charleston to the Star Wars cantina music with lightsabers. I've never loved #Strictly more— SINdy (@Tea_Wench) October 10, 2015 The Star Wars routine on #Strictly was good, but I feel it was missing some twerking Stormtroopers...:) pic.twitter.com/9Cs3CZOc4w— Miserly Investor (@miserlyinvestor) October 10, 2015Daniel O'Donnell's Danny Zuko impression didn't convince many people:The screen presence that Daniel O'Donnell brings is just magical #Strictly pic.twitter.com/i0g4LYj23l— Phillip Beauzeville (@Pablo942000) October 10, 2015I'm not sure my eyes are going to be able to take this #Strictly— Mobeenargh Khan (@mobeenakhan) October 10, 2015Daniel:I've got chills. Anyone else? #Strictly— Jane Garvey (@janegarvey1) October 10, 2015Watching #Strictly & each time I see Daniel O'Donnell all I can think of is the Father Ted episode where they all impersonate Elvis.— Peter Elston (@woodcuttersson) October 10, 2015Daniel O'Donnell is doing the Three Ages Of Elvis from Father Ted! Hurrah! #scd— Gee (@BrokenBiros) October 10, 2015Turned on strictly for the first time in my life just in time to see Daniel. pic.twitter.com/BUBK2JeLJD— Miss Rock (@moi_cheree) October 10, 2015Daniel O'Donnell as Danny Zuko from Grease is something that can never be unseen!! #strictly #SCD— Barnsey (@officialbarnsey) October 10, 2015Daniel O'Donnell's hair tonight on #Strictly be like... pic.twitter.com/oIf2xO4KTH— Rob Smedley (@robsmedley86) October 10, 2015#Strictly Daniel O'Donnel looked more like Morrissey than Danny Zuko pic.twitter.com/wo2HCDT9k6— Robin Galloway (@djrobingalloway) October 10, 2015Peter Andre looked set to be the favourite of the evening, though there wasn't too much enthusiasm:Poundland pirate #strictly— Nicola Miller (@NicMillersTale) October 10, 2015Peter Andre. The only person who looks less tanned after going through the #strictly spray tan.— Ben Cavey (@ben_cavey) October 10, 2015\"Peter Andre is dressed as a pirate tonight.\"\"Where's the plank?\"\"There. Dressed as a pirate.\" #strictlycomedancing— Ian Hyland (@HylandIan) October 10, 2015But it was ultimately Jay who stole the evening (and the series so far):Holy moly! @JayMcGuiness is on fire! Move aside Peter! #Strictly pic.twitter.com/eYaAvAcWMf— Millie Dutt (@millsheep) October 10, 2015I think that this young Jay fella's got skills and is a challenger to #PeterAndre. Just sayin'. #Strictly— Toni McDonald (@toniearlybird) October 10, 2015JAYMAZING @JayMcGuiness @AlionaVilani @bbcstrictly— Zoe Ball (@ZoeTheBall) October 10, 2015Legit do not get this \"oh it's week 3 so I'll only give it a 9 bollox\".
