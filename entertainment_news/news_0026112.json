Brothel workers found the former Los Angeles Lakers player and immediately called an ambulance. \nEditors at TMZ.com report that on Saturday his condition significantly improved, and he is now breathing on his own, but sources told the website he is still using an oxygen mask, and several of his organs are not responding to treatment. \nOdom has been communicating physically and verbally with doctors, after reports on Friday that he awoke from his coma to tell estranged wife Khloe Kardashian that he loved her. The pair split in 2013, and Khloe Kardashian filed for divorce after reports of Odom's infidelity and drug use. A judge has yet to sign off on their divorce, leaving them still legally married. \nKim Kardashian posted a photo of her dancing with her brother-in-law on Instagram.com on Saturday, writing, \"I have faith in you. I believe in the power of prayer and positive energy! Thank you all for your prayers! Lammy - I'm so happy Kendall & I could make you smile today! God is good!\" \nKardashian matriarch Kris Jenner also thanked fans for keeping the sports star in their thoughts, and shared a photo on Instagram of her with son Rob and son-in-law Odom. \"Come on Lamar!!!!\" she wrote. \"You are such a champion... I know you got this.... #ourfighter #pleasepray #love #thatsmileiseverything.\" Copyright WENN.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T19:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:38:53.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
