Models showing the collection featured Jenner again along with Gigi and Bella Hadid, Karlie Kloss and Jourdan Dunn. \n\"I think the models I chose are my friends,\" said Balmain creative director Olivier Rousteing. \"All the girls that I love that can grab my hand and just say, 'Don't worry, It's gonna be fun.' It's a night of love and of friendship and of fun.\" \nClothing ranged from beaded jackets, draped trousers and genie pants. \nAt the end of the runway portion of the presentation, the Backstreet Boys performed a medley of some of their hits. \nThe Balmain x H&M line is intended to be more affordable but that's depending on whom you ask, with some pieces priced at more than $500. \nThe collection goes on sale Nov. 5. \nFollow Alicia Rancilio at http://www.twitter.com/aliciar \nOnline:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T09:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:44:49.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
