Pictures Summary \nWhat did Captain Hook's dying words really mean? What connection does Peter Pan have to the Boy Scouts of America? These and other bits of fascinating trivia related to J.M. Barrie's classic children's character. \nScottish author J.M. Barrie’s “Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn’t Grow Up” is now more than 100 years old. Over the decades, it has entered popular culture on a level that few literary works ever do, influencing everything from movies and TV to the English language itself (as in, for instance, the term “Wendy house” ). \nThe background of Barrie’s story, though, is far more complex — and far stranger — than many realize. \nSo, just in time for this weekend’s release of “Pan,” click here for some interesting facts about Barrie and his timeless creation that even diehard Peter Pan fans might not know. Jeff Peterson is a native of Utah Valley and studied humanities and history at Brigham Young University.
