(Ma-hugot kasi tayong Pinoy!) It is such that many FM stations nowadays produce love advice shows. Even my own radio show has something similar going on.\nIt all started when a listener sent us a deluge of text messages wanting to seek advice for his love problem. (Kahit wala naman akong ganu’ng segment!) I reprimanded him on air about it, trying to make light of the situation. The next day, my boss instructed me to start giving love advice on air. (Ako pa, sarili ko lang di ko ma-advise-an!)\nI also remember decades ago, when Joe D’ Mango dominated the airwaves because of his radio program, “Love Notes.” (Na naging TV show pa ha!) He eventually became a pastor. (Maging pastora kaya ako in the future?! Afraid!)\nDJ BARBIE, DJ LINDSAY, DJ SHEENA\nThe trend continues with 106.7 Energy FM introducing radio jocks Lindsay, Barbie and Sheena, who take turns reading love letters on air every night on their program “Dear Pangga Sa Swabe All Night.” (Swabe ba kayo girls?!)\n“Love really matters to our listeners. This show is for our Pangga. We want to feature inspiring love stories. May hugot pero may aral,” Lindsay said.\nThe girls, though, have other shows on the station.\nLindsay starts Energy FM’s daily programming at 5 a.m. with her show “Breakfast On Air,” while Barbie goes on air 12 noon for “LOL.” Sheena, a newbie, covers the hit songs of the day on the show “Merienda Madness” at 3 in the afternoon.\n“Iba-iba kami ng style. So, sa ‘Dear Pangga Sa Swabe All Night,’ iba-iba din gabi-gabi, depende sa personality ng nakaupo. Minsan may pa-sweet, may palaban, may parang patawa. So, hindi nakakasawang pakinggan,” Barbie shared.\n“Swabe All Night” features selected mellow songs so expect the same when the girls go on air. “Swabe ’yun playlist namin dito. Hindi maingay. At bibigyan natin ng magandang kanta ’yung bawat sulat na babasahin. Pwede ka rin mag-request ng song mo for your letter. So lalo kang mapapa-emote dahil magkaka theme song ka,” Sheena said.\nListeners are encouraged to send their love stories through dearpangga1067@gmail.com. The chosen stories will be featured from 8 p.m. to 12 a.m. on “Dear Pangga Sa Swabe All Night,” 106.7 Energy FM. (’Pag ako sumulat\n(MR.FU hosts on 106.7 EnergyFM, 8 a.m., Monday to Friday and TV5.
