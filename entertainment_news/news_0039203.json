Dream Dance Company will present its first annual production, Genesis, in Hobart. Picture: SUPPLIED Source: Supplied \nDIRECTOR Marko Panzic’s Dream Dance Company will present its first annual production, Genesis , at Hobart’s Theatre Royal next weekend. \nPanzic, who choreographed Genesis with Stephen Tannos, said he set up the company to fill a gap in the market. \n“There are a lot of contemporary and ballet companies, but there’s not really anything that also shows off and fuses jazz, hip-hop and other styles of dance,” he said. \n“So it’s a real mashup of all those genres coming together. \n“Dance is really progressing at the moment and people are wanting more and more to be entertained. \n“We’ve also been listening to the dance schools, and the company fits well with the fact that kids are trained to be versatile and to be good at everything. It’s a voice for a new generation of dance.” \nPanzic auditioned hundreds of dancers before selecting 19 to be part of the company, 18 of whom will be at the Theatre Royal. \n“It was a huge process,” he said. \n“The first thing I looked for was work ethic. I wanted a team who all had the same goal and who would push each other. \n“And I love finding people who don’t know just how good they are. \n“There are also some who were instantly in, including Michael Demeski who won So You Think You Can Dance last year, Jesse Heskett and hip-hop dancers Rob and Dave MacLaine. \n“Having the best of the best on stage together is really awesome, and the fusion is mind-blowing. \n“You sit there expecting to see a dance show, but you walk away saying ‘What just happened?’” \nPanzic said Genesis was the company’s introduction to audiences. \n“It’s the new beginning of dance in Australia,” he said. \n“We celebrate the dancer as an athlete, and all different types of body shapes are represented. \n“You can expect different genres and more commercial music, as well as contemporary dance.” \nThe Dream Dance Company’s production of Genesis will be at the Theatre Royal at 7.30pm on October 31. Tickets are $60 for adults and $55 for groups of 12 or more.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:53:49.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
