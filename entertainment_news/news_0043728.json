By Priya Prakashan on October 10, 2015 at 9:34 AM Comments \nIn a time when people are worn out by hefty increase in petrol and diesel rates, a man has come up which seems to be a perfect solution. Although it is not yet known how it will be implemented practically on a larger scale, but a mechanic from Madhya Pradesh has designed a car which runs on water! \nYes, Raees Makrani from Sagar in Madhya Pradesh has designed a car which runs on water and calcium carbide. Makrani has now filed for a patent for coming up with this new designed car which runs on water and calcium carbide. Calcium carbide is a chemical compound that is mainly used industrially in the production of acetylene and calcium cyanamide. So Calcium carbide and water when put together , it will react to produce acetylene gas. \nThe mechanic is hopeful that the government takes notice of his brand new and creative approach and that his designed car gets noticed. Makrani said that he was inspired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Make in India initiative to come up with this creation. \nIt is quite amazing to see how Makrani is inspired by the national initiative designed to transform India. Government of India’s initiative Make in India encourages Multinational and domestic companies to manufacture their products in India. \nIt is commendable that a Makrani who works as a mechanic in Madhya Pradesh took the national initiative in the right stride and came up with something that makes us proud. His creation will indeed be helpful. It is anticipated that the Makrani will receive the patent of his creation soon. \n  10, 2015 9:34 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:20:46.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
