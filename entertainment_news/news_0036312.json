She says all her fame and acclaim is due to the love and appreciation of her fans. \nThe Bharat Ratna awardee, who is also called the 'Nightingale of India' for her melodious voice, tweeted to thank the prime minister, while she shared a short clip on Facebook to express her gratitude to her fans. \nLata turned 86 on Monday -- the same day that she lost her nephew Hemant Bhosle -- and the Hindi film fraternity wished her a year full of happiness. \nLata tweeted: “@narendramodi Greetings. I'm humbled that you took out time from your busy schedule to wish me on my birthday”. \nShe also shared a link on Twitter, which led to a video on Facebook. \nIn a video clip, the singer said: “I would like to thank you all for your good wishes on my birthday. You all have liked my songs till now and I know that it is because of your love and appreciation that I have gained all the acclaim. I'm indebted to you all and I can never forget this forget. Thank you.\" \nLata is known for songs like \"Aayega aanewaala\", \"Dil wil pyar wyar\", \"Bindiya chamkegi\", \"Tune o rangeele kaisa jaadu kiya\", and \"Aaja shaam hone aayi\". Her track to salute the valour of Indian Army with “Aye mere watan ke logo” still brings tears to the eyes. \nHer younger sister Asha Bhosle lost her elder son Hemant on Lata's birthday. He was suffering from cancer and breathed his last in Scotland.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T14:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T18:16:58.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
