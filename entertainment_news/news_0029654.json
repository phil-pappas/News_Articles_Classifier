Last year the NME cited My Life Story as one of the greatest lost bands of the 90s. \nJake Shillingford, MLS songwriter and front man, said: “In the last few years I’ve moved into writing for movies and TV (with MLS tour guitarist Nick Evans) and as much as it satisfies my orchestral and filmic bent, I don’t have much time to write spikey 3 minute pop songs anymore. \n“So I sat down with my trusty old 12-string and all these twisted couplets started to fire out, a sort of machine gun of vitriolic social commentary. I felt like I’d been reborn.” \nShillingford added, “While the orchestral line up has been indefinitely rested, I felt desperate to get out and air the new material, to the most patient and loyal fans on the planet. \n“The new songs and sound capture the New Wave influences that I grew up with. Despite the Baroque Pop and Britpop tags that were hung on us in the early 90s the heart of MLS was always the edgy passionate and honest songwriting of Badfinger, Cheap Trick and Costello.” Share article \nMy Life Story enjoyed a string of chart hits in the 90s and were at the heart of the Britpop movement, being huge live favourites with their flamboyant shows and loyal fanbase. The band scored six Top 40 hits, including ‘12 Reasons Why I Love Her’, ‘Strumpet’ and ‘Sparkle’, described by Melody Maker at the time as: “Satisfying escapism. Taking life’s mundanities and making them magical.” While Smash Hits said: “12 Reasons Why” is the best pop single of last year not to feature the Spice Girls.” Promoted stories \nThe band briefly returned in 2006, after a six-year hiatus, with a “best of” album entitled Sex & Violins. This was followed by Megaphone Theology (B-sides & Rarities). They have since performed packed-out shows at The Astoria, O2 Shepherds Bush Empire and Koko.
