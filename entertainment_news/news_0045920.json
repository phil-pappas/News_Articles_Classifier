(LOS ANGELES) -- We've already heard Mark Hamill voicing Luke Skywalker in a Star Wars: The Force Awakens trailer, talking to someone about how the force is strong in his family, possibly the next member in line. Now, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy has all but confirmed there is a new Skywalker on the horizon. \nShe was explaining the difference between the main Star Wars movies and the planned spinoffs, like Rogue One. \"The Saga films focus on the Skywalker family saga,\" she told Costco Connection , the retailer’s monthly magazine. \"The stories follow a linear narrative that connects to the previous six films. The Force Awakens follows Return of the Jedi and continues that generational story.\" \nKennedy continued, \"The Anthology films offer opportunities to explore fresh characters, new storylines and a variety of genres inside the Star Wars universe.\" \nAs for the continuation of the Skywalker story: According to The Hollywood Reporter , new character Rey, played by Daisy Ridley, is rumored to possibly be Leia and Han's daughter. Maybe uncle Luke can teach her the ways of the Force? \nLucasfilms hasn't responded to a call seeking confirmation of Kennedy's quotes in the magazine. ABC News and Lucasfilm are both owned by Disney. \nStar Wars: The Force Awakens blasts into theaters December 18. \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
