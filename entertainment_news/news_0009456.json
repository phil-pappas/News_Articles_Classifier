But as he was a late add to tonight’s episode, “Tonight” is not hunting for a replacement but will proceed with the previously scheduled lineup of “Steve Jobs” star Michael Fassbender, “Room” star Brie Larson and musical guest Cee Lo Green.\nBoehner’s resignation set off a political horse race in Washington among prospective successors.
