Last Saturday, with just under 30 seconds left in the game, a fight broke out in the stands as the Otay Ranch Broncos played the Los Angeles-based Inland Empire Ducks at Otay Ranch High School. The fight was captured on video and has been widely circulated on YouTube.\"Punches being thrown, people falling off the bleachers, all types of stuff,\" said Brandon Duncan, whose son plays for the Broncos. As a result of the fracas, both teams -- in the 14-and-under division -- were kicked out of the San Diego Youth Football & Cheer League by Commissioner Cathy Luna. The league's actions have angered parents, and Duncan said, \"Punish kids for something that you know they had nothing to do with, it's just not right.\" Duncan told ABC15's sister station, 10News, the fight never flowed onto the field and the commissioner was well aware that the Ducks were a team with a reputation for violence.\"This team has already had fights, they've had parents in the stand throwing bottles, smoking marijuana,\" said Duncan. Bronco parents, in a partnership with the National Action Network, plan to file a lawsuit against the commissioner.\"Instead of dealing with the issue, the one parent, we just take the whole team out; they knew that this L.A. team had a record of crime on this team and they still brought the team down to play against the Broncos,\" said National Action Network President Shane Harris. Some parents told 10News they don't know why an out-of-county team was even allowed to play in the San Diego league to begin with. Copyright 2015 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved.
