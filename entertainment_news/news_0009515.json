Home brewer Crigger often provided the sippable suds. One evening, he arrived with an India pale ale and pomegranate wheat beer in tow. \n\"These are really, really delicious beers,\" Troy recalls saying. \"You should make this.\" \nAL.com readers seem to agree; they voted for Rocket Republic Mach 1 IPA as Alabama's favorite signature beer. \nWithin a month, the friends incorporated Rocket Republic. Within another month, they were brewing. \nThe two beers that made such an impression on Troy remain on the brewery's menu as Mach 1 IPA and Pomegranate Planet. Rocket Republic's IPA embodies an East-Coast style, which is maltier than its West-Coast cousins. That's only one of the beer's distinguishing factors, they say. \nMach 1 incorporates rye malt, which adds a spicy characteristic and smooths out the traditional IPA bitterness on first sip. But hop heads, don't assume this is a less-hoppy IPA. As it sits in the fermenter, Rocket Republic brewers add dry Centennial and Cascade hops in a process called late hopping or hop bursting. \nThe result is a citrus-y flavor bomb that starts out easy and finishes with the pleasing bitterness for which IPAs are known. \nCrigger sometimes experiments with the IPA, adding 100-percent grapefruit juice, infusing it with tangerine slices or even Sumatran coffee beans. (If there's anything Crigger is as crazy about as beer, it's coffee, Troy says.) \nAs Rocket Republic continues to grow, its owners are exploring canning and bottling options with the hope of distributing more beer outside of Madison County. They expect that distribution to begin next year. \nCrigger says, \"Tap handles are finite. They rotate and they change at all times.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T09:05:32.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
