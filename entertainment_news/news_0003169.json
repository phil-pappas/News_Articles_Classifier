This year 164 galleries from 27 countries are in the contemporary art section of the fair, which also has an associated fair displaying old masters.\nIn another section of one of the vast marquee tents where London Frieze is held, the Hauser & Wirth Gallery has created a large, open space called \"Field\" where artworks are mounted on plinths. One of the mounted objects is a multi-coloured skull, another is a teddy bear with a funnel inserted in its bottom.\n\"What I wanted to do this year was to create a kind of open platform - a sort of democratic landscape for us to display all different artists, all different ages, different media, so I came up with the idea of 'Field',\" said Neil Wenman, a senior director at Hauser & Wirth, which has galleries in Zurich, London and New York.\n\"It is about this idea of the kind of multitude that I wanted to show,\" Wenman added. \"So we have 42 plinths, we are displaying works by 30 different artists, over a time span of 35 years. So the very earliest work is from 1960, the very latest work was finished two days ago.\"\nLast year about 60,000 people visited the two simultaneous art fairs, Frieze London, which closes on Oct. 17, and Frieze Masters, which runs a day longer.\n(Reporting by Duarte Guarrido; Writing by Michael Roddy; Editing by Mark Heinrich )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:21:28.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
