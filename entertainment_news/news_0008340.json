Dunes will be built atop a massive, man-made rock barrier, according to the newspaper. The restoration work is expected to begin in the spring. \nBroad Beach has seen decades of deterioration caused by pounding storms and high tides. \nAmong those who will be contributing to the $3.1 million annual fund for the next 10 years are \"Modern Family\" co-creator Steve Levitan, billionaire businessman Patrick Soon-Shiong and actors Dustin Hoffman, Ray Romano and Pierce Brosnan. \n\"As I understand it, what the homeowners are doing on Broad Beach is unique: We are funding the restoration totally at our own expense,\" said Michael Sitrick, a crisis-public relations man who has had a getaway home on the shoreline since 1999. \nThe plan, approved by a 7-5 vote Oct. 9, has met with skepticism from coastal advocates, who remain unconvinced that the pricey venture will work and who fear that the public could pay a high cost in reduced beach access if it fails. \nJack Ainsworth, the Coastal Commission's senior deputy director, described the plan as a pilot project subject to the vagaries of climate change. \n\"You can have the best modeling in the world but not know the effect of all the variables,\" Ainsworth told the Times. \"Certainly, this gets more difficult as time goes on and the sea level rises and we have more vigorous storms.\" \nInformation from: Los Angeles Times, http://www.latimes.com/ \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T19:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:52:24.636+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
