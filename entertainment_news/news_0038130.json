A few simple tips will help make it easy to cook up one delicious holiday season.\nPlan a menu that lets you enjoy the party, too. Serve a simple main course, and let the smaller dishes and desserts be the heroes of the holiday. Flavorful finger foods, appe­tizers and sweets are easily prepared and guests can serve themselves. Keep your kitchen stocked with a few key ingredients that can be used in a variety of dishes. For example, Philadelphia Cream Cheese makes the holidays because it's perfect in rich cheesecake and other desserts, but it also lends a creamy texture to appetizers and main dishes. Remember that special can be simple, and recipes do not need to be complex to be guest-worthy. Take care to offer a diverse selection to satisfy a range of tastes and dietary needs, and guests will be eager to enjoy the bounty of your efforts. If you'll be hosting or attending multiple events, work ahead. You can make the same dish more than once for different groups of people. Look for recipes you can prep or cook and freeze ahead of time, so you can shop once and make the most of your kitchen time. Impromptu visits add to the excitement of the season, but leave little time to serve up your culinary best. Find a few go-to recipes for flavorful appetizers, such as these Savory Mini Cheese Balls, that can be prepared in minutes when unexpected guests drop by.
