AlunaGeorge melds R&B nostalgia with futuristic beats 1  /  2 Back to Gallery Some musicians grow up with other musicians, learning all the basics together, tapping out songs in bedrooms together, starting and stopping and restarting bands together. But that was never Aluna Francis. “I didn’t have musician friends,” she says. “I didn’t know anyone in a band.”\nInstead she’d log onto Myspace, click around profiles, see who was out there, not so different from the way others might look for friends or dates. “I was very Internet generation,” Francis says over the phone from Los Angeles. You “talk about what you want to do, and you go and meet them, and it’s very risky, and then you just get involved. If you build a personal relationship, that’s great.”\nDidn’t feel weird \nAll of this to explain why, when she wound up in George Reid’s bedroom, after he’d made a remix for another band she was in, it didn’t feel so weird to be working with a total stranger. \n“The thing that struck us, mainly, was that it was easy and fun — and surprising, as well,” she told the BBC’s Annie Mac not long after she and Reid had begun to make waves as the British duo AlunaGeorge. “The music that we were coming out with just felt fresh and new to us.”\nNot long after they got together, the two posted a video for an early single called “ You Know You Like It ” on YouTube. Francis — several of her, actually — dances to glitchy computer sounds strung over a thudding bass while she provides the cool, willowy vocals. “I’m no fool, no, I’m not a follower/ I don’t take things as they come/ If they bring me down.” \nThe whole thing felt like one part electropop and one part R&B. This was around 2011, not that long ago really, but spacey, futuristic sounds — the sort they trade in — and genre terms like indie R&B or alt R&B were hardly as well-worn as they are today. The song took off.\n“There was this weird moment like a month or two later — it was like, we’re one of those things that’s been passed around the Internet,” Reid said in the same BBC interview.\nAlunaGeorge has been a fixture on indie music blogs and British charts ever since. What’s somewhat odd is that their signature sound, that melting together of genres, of past and future, wasn’t necessarily one they immediately embraced.\nIf anything, Francis has said in several interviews that she initially wanted to avoid the R&B sound. The reason was twofold. Firstly, maybe mostly, were the lyrics. “A lot of the lyrical content was very basic and just about getting into the bedroom with somebody somewhere, and, as a teenager, I was dealing with other s—,” she says. “I wasn’t really identifying with songs about ‘let me lick you up and down.’”\nSecondly, something about the vocals felt limiting. Francis talks a lot about “caricatured voices” — acts like the Knife and CocoRosie. “I would say R&B voices I’ve always found slightly restrictive. It’s about being sexy, not lovely, not much else — maybe cool — which is nothing I identify with,” she says. “Caricatured voices to me are ones that can produce all sorts of emotions: Anger, power, weirdness, depression, frustration. You know, all those things that make people human.”\nLeaning into future \nDespite all that, their sound wound up steeped in R&B nostalgia while simultaneously leaning into the future. Francis has made her peace with that. “I know the band. I know the rules. I like to bend them.”\nSome four years later, the duo — set to play Mezzanine on Wednesday, Oct. 14 — have put out the well-reviewed “Body Work,” their first LP, and taken part in a number of collaborations with the likes of Disclosure, Jack Ü (Diplo and Skrillex) and, most recently, ZHU. This summer, they also saw “You Know You Like It” get a second life thanks to a wildly popular remix from DJ Snake. \nSecond album \nThese days, Francis says, the focus is on their second album. The two spent most of the last year working on the release together. When they’re in the studio, she works on the “topline, lyrical department” while Reid concerns himself with the “musical production department.”\n“But we do often involve ourselves in what the other person’s doing. It’s like a proper sense of the word collaboration.”\nAs she sets off on a monthlong U.S. tour, Reid is going to hang back in the studio. She expects they’ll have a single out before the end of the year and a full album out in the spring. “At this point, I’d say, we’re closer than we’ve ever been,” Francis says, then laughs a bit. “I think anybody working on their second album faces the reality of, all right, are you for real? Are you doing this?”\nThey’re past that anxiety, she says. “I feel like there was a point in the process that we maybe started to stray a little bit from what people would associate with our sound, just as an exploration. At this point, we’re back doing what we do best, but I would say maybe with a more expansive sound.”\nRyan Kost is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
