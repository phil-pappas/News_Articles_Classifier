The Amit Trivedi-composed soundtrack has five tracks, four written by Amitabh Bhattacharya and one by Anvita Dutt. The title track ' Shaam Shaandaar' opens the album and has the composer himself behind the mike. The techno beats and shaadi instruments like dhol and horns make this party number rambunctious. Second song ' Gulaabo ' has a retro feel. Vishal Dadlani delivers energetic vocals as usual.\nSinger Anusha Mani matches his enthusiasm in the phataka song. ' Nazdeekiyan ' goes down the mushy route. The arrangement is dreamy enough and Neeti Mohan's vocals are on par. The lazy voice of Nikhil Paul George doesn't sit well with the overall mood. Anvita Dutt's lyrics shine. ' Senti Wali Mental ' is a lengthy qawwali, but doesn't get boring because of the switches in pace. Quirky lyrics and light-hearted banter make it a possible play option at sangeet ceremonies. Singers Arijit Singh, Mohan, Swanand Kirkire and Trivedi bring it to a grand close. ' Raitaa Phailgaya ' is a wacky gaana with Punjabi beats. The vocals of Divya Kumar have gusto. The funny lyrics and the masaledaar composition might fit the situation well, something the film's release will tell. A soundtrack that can be digested easily by one and all.\nLISTEN: Songs of Shaandaar on Gaana.com\nWATCH: Shaandaar | Official Trailer | Alia Bhatt & Shahid Kapoor", "external_links": ["http://gaana.com/search/songs/Shaandaar", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/k99-vMPh3-A"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T11:18:33.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
