Rough cut (no reporter narration). ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript \nROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) \"Star Wars\" fans were given the longest look yet at the upcoming \"The Force Awakens\" film on Monday (October 19), in an action-packed trailer which became the top trending topic on Twitter and sparked a rush of bookings which crashed a U.S. online ticket seller. The trailer, which featured franchise veterans Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher alongside a cast of newcomers, kicked off with lead character Rey (Daisy Ridley) as a scavenger presumed to be the daughter of Princess Leia (Fisher) and Han Solo (Ford). Fisher makes her trailer debut as Leia, along with the character's trademark hair buns, as she is embraced by Han Solo. Leia is heard saying \"The Force, it's calling to you. Just let it in.\" Notably missing was Mark Hamill, who reprised his role as Luke Skywalker but is yet to be seen in character. The trailer for the film, directed by J.J. Abrams, provided the vast scope the new movie will be taking and the challenges that its leading characters will face. Finn (John Boyega), a Stormtrooper on the run, says \"I was raised to do one thing, but I've got nothing to fight for,\" and is later seen battling villain Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Kylo Ren is shown alongside the charred mask of Darth Vader, saying \"Nothing will stand in our way. I will finish what you started.\" The film is expected to gross about $100 million in North America on its opening weekend, Rentrak's senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian said, adding that it could earn over $2 billion globally. \"Star Wars,\" created by filmmaker George Lucas, has grossed more than $4.4 billion globally since 1977 with six films. \"The Force Awakens\" is the first of three new \"Star Wars\" movies being produced by Disney since it purchased the Lucasfilm franchise in 2012 for $4.05 billion.
