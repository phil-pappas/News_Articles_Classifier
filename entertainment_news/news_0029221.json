Baddiel suffered anxiety attacks after forgetting names (Matt Crossick/PA) \nBaddiel told the Daily Mirror: “Almost definitely I’ve got it. Scientists are making out we’re all getting it eventually because we’re all going to live longer, and the longer you live the more likely you are to get it. \n“I’ve started already to forget names much more than I used to and although I think that is considered to sort-of be OK for someone of my age, I don’t. Every time it happens, I think, ‘OK, early onset’.” \nPick’s disease – or frontotemporal dementia – is an uncommon type of dementia which is thought to affect around 16,000 people in the UK, according to the NHS. \nThe condition tends to affect the parts of the brain that are largely responsible for language and the ability to plan and organise, as well as playing an important role in controlling behaviour. David Baddiel is best known for his work with Frank Skinner (Sean Dempsey/PA) \nBaddiel said his father’s symptoms have been severe and included the 80-year-old crudely propositioning women at a religious gathering to mark his wife’s death. \nThe father-of-two – who is probably best known for his work with fellow comedian Frank Skinner – also described his struggle with depression before his children, Dolly, 14, and 10-year-old Ezra, helped his recovery.
