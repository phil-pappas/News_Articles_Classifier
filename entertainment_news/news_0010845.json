So what the political revolution is is forcing a debate, not about trivia, but about real issues.\"\nMacFarlane spent his time on stage endorsing Sanders and commending him for his performance at Tuesday night's debate in Las Vegas. Concerning the presidential candidate's answer when asked what the greatest national security threat is, MacFarlane said Sanders was \"the only candidate...who gave the correct answer: climate change.\"\n\"Of all our biggest challenges, social inequality, healthcare, this is the one that must go immediately to the front of the line. This is the only one with a non-negotiable timetable,\" he said.\nAlready endorsed by Hollywood stars such as Sarah Silverman , Neil Young , Mimi Kennedy and Mark Ruffalo , actress Maribeth Monroe also joins the ranks of California's Sanders supporters. The Workaholics actress took to Twitter to express her anticipation ahead of Wednesday's rally, saying, \"ok senator. I'm ready to hear some revolution. #FeelTheBern.\" After MacFarlane's speech, she added a supportive, \"You killed it,\" mentioning she sat in the \"nose bleed seats.\"\nLater Wednesday night, Variety reports the U.S. Senator attended a more traditional fundraiser -- his ninth so far -- in Beverly Hills at the estate of Syd and Linda Leibovitch. With tickets at $250 each, about 300 people are said to have shown up.\n\"The truth is there are many people in this country who have money but also believe in social justice,\" he is reported to have said.\n Democrats propose free college during debate Democrats spar at first presidential debate Hillary Clinton talks email scandal, Trump on 'Tonight Show'", "external_links": ["http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/seth-macfarlane-rallies-hundreds-bernie-832312", "https://facebook.com/unitedpress", "https://www.facebook.com/UnitedPress", "http://variety.com/2015/scene/news/bernie-sanders-seth-macfarlane-fundraiser-hollywood-1201618406/", "https://twitter.com/MaribethMonroe/status/654458295348957188", "https://twitter.com/MaribethMonroe/status/654460083850514432"], "published": "2015-10-15T21:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:50:17.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
