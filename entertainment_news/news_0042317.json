Holding two jiggers in his left hand, he measures spirits into steel shakers before adding sweetening, souring, and bittering potions. A serene look settles over his face as he vigorously shakes one drink with his left hand while stirring the other clockwise with his right. The smile returns as he strains each drink into the chilled glasses and reaches out to serve them. \nAngel flexes his wings on another Church Night. \nOne of the key figures in Birmingham's booming cocktail scene, Angel Negrin runs a twice-weekly craft cocktail program at Lou's, a Lakeview hangout for a loyal, mostly beer and mixed-drinks crowd since it opened in 1987. \nIt was pure coincidence that the bar shifts Negrin inherited at Lou's in January 2013 were on Wednesdays and Sundays. \n\"As the pop-up became established, customers began asking when cocktails are available,\" Negrin says. \"To help them remember we'd tell them to think 'church nights.' We said it often enough and the guests thought it was clever enough it kind of became a thing. Only then did it get a title.\" \nChurch Night is a one-of-a-kind program in a one-of-a-kind bar. It was the city's first cocktail program independent of a restaurant (Octane, whose kitchen-free cocktail program Negrin also helped establish, was the second). Lou's, grandfathered under a license the state is no longer allowed to issue, is the only bar in Alabama that sells both drinks in-house and bottles to-go. \nThe pop-up arose from discussions Negrin had with owner Michael Carpri about ways to expand the Lou's experience by adding classic cocktails and more esoteric brands of retail liquors and mixers to the pub/store's standard brands. Church Night has expanded to include obscure vintage cocktails, personal recipes, and drinks that pay tribute to mixology mentors. \nNegrin divides the main menu into shaken and stirred drinks, plus compositions served in tall glasses. Classics (Algonquin to Vieux Carre) are listed on one side; the reverse includes Church Night specials (such as the rum-spiked Ham Shot First). Riffs on Old Fashioned cocktails might include a select whiskey from Colorado or a 15-year barrel-aged rum. \nPrices on Negrin's favorite drink are discounted from 3 p.m.-7 p.m. on Church Nights. The Daiquiri Time Out includes choices of rums from the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, Nicaragua, Haiti, Guyana, and Panama. \nThese aren't adult slushies. This is the classic recipe that seduced Hemingway. Negrin explains the appeal: \n\"Aged white rum is a noble spirit, with a depth of flavor from years of barrel-aging combined with the bright, crisp, and dry qualities of highly-rectified clear liquor. The bracing acidity of fresh-filtered lime juice and the sensitive and judicial application of pure cane sugar provide pleasing silky roundness. Absolutely precise measurements and the hardest possible shake to aerate provide lightness and space, the final two essential aspects that will invariably put a smile on the face of the guest.\" \nNegrin views classic daiquiris as a great portal to enjoy premium rums, which are experiencing the kind of renaissance that has boosted Scotch, bourbon, rye, and gin. \n\"We're getting back to where it was before it became a mass-produced, factory product,\" he says. \"White rum is the new vodka.\" \nInvented by a U.S. bartender in Cuba, the daiquiri is a reflection of Negrin, the son of Cuban immigrants. But it is more a facet in an overall personal evolution toward simplicity and brightness that affects everything from Negrin's philosophy to how he eats and drinks – even the music that moves the accomplished former orchestral saxophone soloist who taught at Samford University, UAB, and Birmingham Southern College. \nNegrin has devoted the same passion and energy to his study of cocktails and mixology as he has to music. A Church Night daiquiri special might include an experimental blend of premium rums, or new products he just got in for Lou's retail side. \nNegrin tended bar at Chez Fonfon for four years before starting restaurant cocktail programs in 2010 at Bettola and in 2012 at now-defunct Veranda. He also now tends bar on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays at the improvisation-oriented Collins Bar in downtown Birmingham. \nChurch Night may be a heavenly pour from Angel's shaker, but Negrin says it works precisely because it is at Lou's. He credits the support of Carpri and mainstay bartenders Eric Williams and Miss O. Longtime Lou's patrons mix freely with the church-nighters, and the regular bartenders are deft with the new drinks. \n\"Lou's was a successful bar for 26 years before this started,\" Negrin says. \"This has been a hangout for a wide cross-section of Birmingham – undergraduate students, retirees, doctors, lawyers, school teachers. Church Night is an augmentation of Lou's, adding to it without cannibalizing any part.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T23:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T08:04:28.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
