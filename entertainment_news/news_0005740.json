It was our moment to make our point by subverting the message using the show itself.\" \n\"Homeland\" creator Alex Gansa admits broadcasting the footage was a mistake, telling Deadline.com, \"We wish we'd caught these images before they made it to air. However, as 'Homeland' always strives to be subversive in its own right and a stimulus for conversation, we can't help but admire this act of artistic sabotage.\" Copyright WENN.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T18:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:13:11.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
