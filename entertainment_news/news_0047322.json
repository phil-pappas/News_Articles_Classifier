Buy this photo Posted: Wednesday, October 7, 2015 11:02 pm Insider: Pirates season ends quietly against Arrieta in wild card game By John Perrotto and Bill Allmann Times Sports Correspondents Timesonline.com | 0 comments \nRECAP \nJake Arrieta carried his masterful pitching over to the postseason by tossing a four-hit shutout as the Chicago Cubs beat the Pirates, 4-0, in the National League wild-card game on Wednesday night at PNC Park. \nThe right-hander struck out 11 and walked none in his first career playoff start, needing 113 pitches to finish his gem. \nArrieta went 12-1 with a 0.75 ERA in 15 starts following the All-Star break as he finished the regular season leading the major leagues in wins with a 22-6 record. He also pitched 22 scoreless while winning his final three starts. \nThe Cubs move on to face the Cardinals in the best-of-five NL Division Series, which begins Friday night at St. Louis. Chicago has won nine games in a row, including the regular season and allowed just nine runs in that span. \nThe Pirates bowed out in the wild-card game for the second year in a row despite having the second-best record in the major leagues during the regular season at 98-64. The Cardinals (100-62) had the best record and the Cubs (97-65) were third-best. \nThe top two hitters in the Cubs’ batting order, center fielder Dexter Fowler and rookie right fielder Kyle Schwarber, combined to go 5 for 7 with four runs scored and four RBIs while each hitting a home run. \nFowler was 3 for 4 as he became the first Cubs player to ever have at least three runs and three hits while hitting a home run and stealing a base in a postseason game. Schwarber went 2 for 3 with three RBIs. \nPirates ace right-hander Gerrit Cole took the loss after going 19-8 in the regular season, including winning his last three starts. He allowed all four runs and six hits in five innings with one walk and four strikeouts. \nKEY MOMENT \nThe Pirates had their one shot at Arrieta when, down 4-0, they loaded the bases with one out in the sixth inning. However, Starling Marte hit into an inning-ending double play. \nSTAR OF THE GAME \nArrieta picked up his fourth win of the season against the Pirates. \nHIDDEN STAT \n9. The Cubs have won nine straight games, including the regular season, and given up nine runs in that span. \nNOTEWORTHY \n--Utility player Sean Rodriguez started at first base despite making just 10 starts at the position during the regular season as manager Clint Hurdle opted for defense in matchup between two aces -- Cubs right-hander Jake Arrieta and Pirates right-hander Gerrit Cole. \nFirst baseman Pedro Alvarez was on the bench despite his team-high 27 home runs. Alvarez also led all major league first baseman with 23 errors -- 12 more than anyone else -- and is 2 for 17 in his career against Arrieta. \nHowever, with the Pirates down 3-0 in the third inning, Alvarez pinch hit for Rodriguez, struck out then stayed in the game at first base. \nRodriguez has made 28 regular-season starts at first in his eight-year career. \n--Rodriguez was ejected following a benches-clearing incident in the seventh inning. \nThe dugouts and bullpens emptied when Arrieta, who was working on a two-hit shutout, was hit on the right hip by a pitch from left-hander reliever Tony Watson. \nArrieta had hit Francisco Cervelli and Josh Harrison with pitchers earlier in the game. \nThe Pirates remain angry about losing rookie infielder Jung Ho Kang for the season in a Sept. 17 game against the Cubs at PNC Park when outfielder Chris Coghlan slid into him at second base while trying to break up a double play. \nKang suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee and a broken fibula in his left leg. \n--Kang joined the team for pre-game introductions in a wheelchair. \nKang will stay in Pittsburgh indefinitely to continue his rehab, but the Pirates are hopeful he will be able to return home for at least part of the offseason. \nCoghlan was heartily booed during introductions. \n--The Pirates decided to carry nine pitchers on the roster for Wednesday night’s game. One of them is left-hander Francisco Liriano, who was scheduled to start Friday night at St. Louis in Game 1 of the National League Division Series, though that became moot with Wednesday night’s loss. \nHurdle wanted Lirano, who was on his regular four days of rest after starting last Friday against Cincinnati, available in the event that something happened to Cole or someone was needed to pitch multiple innings if the game went extra innings. \n--Left-handed reliever Antonio Bastardo pitched a perfect sixth inning, striking out two, after allowing just two hits in nine scoreless innings to finish the regular season. \n--This marked only the third time in Pittsburgh history that the Pirates have appeared in three straight postseasons. The other times were 1970-72 and 1990-92. \n--The Pirates and Cubs met in the postseason for the first time. They have been divisional opponents since 1969, the first year Major League Baseball went to divisional play. \n--Cubs rookie right fielder Kyle Schwarber’s two-run home run in the third inning off Cole cleared the right-field stands and was estimated at 449 feet. According to MLB Statcast, the exit velocity off the bat was 111.4 mph. \n--Cubs center fielder Dexter Fowler’s solo home run in the fifth inning of Cole was his first in exactly one month since connecting Sept. 7 off the St. Louis Cardinals’ Lance Lynn. \nFowler’s three hits were as many as he had in his previous postseason experience, going 3 for 14 for the Colorado Rockies in a four-game loss to the Philadelphia Phillies in 2009 in a National League Division Series. \nUP NEXT", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:40:33.745+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
