He is all about his art and music.\n\"I don't actually know what my target audience is and I don’t know anything about the music business. I just do what I do, which is make music, which is what I've always done. I just like making songs that I like and that's it,\" he said.\nProduced by Electric Light Orchestra frontman Jeff Lynne and co-written with his long-time collaborator Jim Vallance, \"Get Up,\" also boasts a few gentler songs, like \"Don’t Even Try,\" and \"We Did it All.\"\nAdams, a trim father of two who turns 56 in November, also has a passion for photography, with a new book on abstract photography due out soon. It follows \"Exposed,\" a collection of portraits of entertainment and fashion celebrities, and \"Wounded - The Legacy of War,\" depicting photographs of soldiers maimed in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nAdams has lined up an extensive tour to promote the new album and admits it is challenging to focus on his passions simultaneously.\n\"I think what's nice about having another venue to be creative in is you tend to get a break from what you do ... And when you come back to it, you have a new perspective for music,\" he said, adding: \"Music is always the top of the heap. I’m not going to quit my day job.\"\n(Editing by Jill Serjeant and G Crosse)\nCanadian singer Bryan Adams performs onstage in Riga December 4, 2007.
