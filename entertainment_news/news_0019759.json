By PAN PYLASAssociated Press \nLONDON (AP) - A glitzy premiere is an inherent part of the whole Bond experience. \nAnd no doubt Monday's World Premiere of \"Spectre,\" the 24th official James Bond film, at the Royal Albert Hall in London will deliver the expected goods: royalty, celebrities, adoring fans and a photographer or two. \nJust like many elements of the films themselves, the marketing of the Bond series follows a successful template. As one Bond film ends, the quest for details about the next one begins. \nAnd those involved with the lucrative - and hugely expensive - franchise have no qualms in walking the well-trodden path so \"Spectre\" can more than recoup its hefty outlays. The media blitz ahead of the premiere started in earnest Thursday with photo shoots and TV appearances involving the cast. \nThe buzz over Daniel Craig's fourth and potentially last outing as the British secret agent with the 007 moniker started almost as soon as the well-received \"Skyfall\" hit the screens back in 2012. Now, there's almost as much anticipation about who will eventually replace Craig than for \"Spectre\" itself, which has already garnered largely positive reviews following Wednesday's first showing to the press. \nFirst came the announcement of the name of the new Bond film, followed by various photo opportunities, carefully crafted trailers, as well as slick promotional activity from the film's partners such as Heineken, Omega and Sony. \nThe process ends with official premieres around the world. This is the third time that the Royal Albert Hall will host the World Premiere, following \"Die Another Day\" in 2002 and \"Skyfall.\" Prince William, his wife Kate and brother Prince Harry are all expected to be in attendance. \nThe Associated Press has been covering the Bond franchise from its more subdued beginnings with \"Dr. No\" over 50 years ago. Here are some memorable moments surrounding the glamorous promotion of Bond films, as captured by photographers from The AP. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
