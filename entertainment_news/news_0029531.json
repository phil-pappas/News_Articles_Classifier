He said: “They were advertising in the newspaper for disc jockeys and a load of us went along. They narrowed it town to three who all took a trial and after the three months I was offered the residency. The rollerdome was a big hit in Wolverhampton \n“We worked there for two years but it was a big part of our marriage because we spent a lot of time together. \n“We actually got married shortly after starting and one of the managers wanted us to get married on roller skates, but neither of us could do it that well.” \n“It was a big big part of my life. It meant something to say you were the resident DJ, although at that time being a DJ it was something you did in an evening – you couldn’t make a living out of it.” \nDuring the day Mr Carter worked at Woden Transformer in Bilston, while Jean worked in the duplicating office at Wednesbury Tubes before hitting the rollerdrome in the evenings. \nThe building underwent a refurbishment in 1969 and the floor was replaced with Canadian maple wood – which cost £10,000. \nWhen the rollerdrome shut to the public, Mr Carter played matches for the roller hockey team. \nHe said: “It seemed like I spent my life in the place. But me and my wife have got really fond memories. The rollerdome was a big thing in Wolverhampton and the surrounding areas and when they were on about closing it the comments that came – nobody could believe that they were going to shut it.” Jade McGrath and Lucy Calrow at WV Active Aldersley \nAfter the Whispering Wheels was closed down, it was destroyed by a fire on December 23, 1976. But all these years later rocking and roller skating is back with a bang in Wolverhampton thanks to leisure centre membership team leader Kerry Williams and Jerry Mcgrath, of Jerry’s Mobile Roller Skating, who have teamed up to revitalise the movement. \nAnd due to it being such a huge hit with families, it will be extending its hours from 6pm to 8.30pm. What do you think? Be the first to comment \nMr Carter said it was a great to see and he would be more than willing to return to the decks for a night or two. \nEntry for the new events at WV Active Leisure Village Centre is £4 and skate hire is a further £1.
