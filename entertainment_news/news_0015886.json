Any misbehavior in a certain way, it depends on the sensitivity of the behavior. \n\"If you have skeletons coming out of your closet that expose yourself to abnormal or criminal behavior, then yeah, you put yourself on that blacklist. Because people won't work with you.\" \nBryan also referenced a time he had experienced the self-imposed blacklist, recalling a project he was promised in his early days as an actor. \n\"There was a time when I was told that I was up for a movie, many years ago,\" he said. \"And I was very excited about it because it was a job, and they said: 'I think they're getting O.J. Simpson to be in the movie too, and I went: 'Oh no, no.' And as actors started hearing about that, they started dropping out and the movie fell apart because it was impossible to sustain.\" \nO.J. was famously tried for the murder of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman in 1994, but was found not guilty. He was later found liable for the deaths in a civil suit.
