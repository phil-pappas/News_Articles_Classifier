The moment came on Sunday but before she could look at him properly, the infant was kidnapped after she literally handed over the child to the abductor in Bowring hospital.\nFarida, resident of Kadugodi and wife of goods autorickshaw driver Syed Mujib, was admitted to hospital around 10am on Thursday and gave birth at 4pm the same day. But as the infant was not breathing properly, he was immediately shifted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). On Sunday afternoon, Farida was finally called to feed her son.\nAround 12.40 pm, she rushed to the NICU and fed the infant sitting outside the unit. Even as she was finishing, a woman struck up a conversation with her.\n\"He's such a beautiful boy. I have three girls myself,\" the woman told Farida and asked her if she could hold the baby. A proud Farida gave the baby to the woman who started playing with him. Minutes later, when Farida looked around, the woman was gone. So was her baby.\nAs she looked around and didn't see anyone, she realized something was amiss and called her sister-in-law Salma, who had gone to the pharmacy. Salma rushed back. Incidentally, Salma passed the kidnapper on the way, but had no idea that her nephew was in her hands.\n\"I was in a hurry and the woman had covered up the baby in her burqa. I didn't realize it was my nephew in her hands. I barely noticed her,\" Salma said.\nWhen the family couldn't find the baby, they informed police who rushed to the spot.\nAlthough Bowring Hospital was searched thoroughly, they were unable to find the woman or the baby. This is the first such incident in Bowring Hospital in years, while such kidnappings are regularly reported from Vani Vilas hospital.\nPolice immediately recovered footage of CCTV in the hospital. It shows the woman playing with the baby for about 5 minutes in the NICU before leaving. Instead of using the lift, she used the stairs. At 12.43pm, the woman is seen reaching the main gate of Bowring hospital with nobody stopping her.\nPolice are trying to find if she had an accomplice. \"The footage shows the woman speaking to a man before she heads to NICU. We are verifying whether he has anything to do with the kidnapping,\" DCP (east) N Satheesh said.\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-05T13:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:24:48.981+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
