As the film begins, we are in India, with three men who are silent and grim. They are in a small tent that is attached to the windblown granite side of a mountain. Their tent hangs there, miles in the air. That mountain is Meru, a broad-shouldered behemoth of stone, ice, and snow that, into the present century, shrugged off all comers. World-class climbers who had conquered Everest and Denali later died here. Often, they perished when attempting to ascend that part of Meru known as the Shark’s Fin — a sheer rock face that is akin to a thousand Heartbreak Hills. In this film, we will inch up the Fin with veteran mountaineers Conrad Anker and Jimmy Chin, and with their less-experienced teammate, Renan Ozturk. All three, however, seem to understand what the limits of acceptable risk should be for them, as a unit, during their perilous journey. Before actually setting out on their climb, the trio establish base camp at about fourteen thousand feet — an impressive elevation that would top off any peak in our Rocky Mountains. Each man must carry two hundred pounds of gear up through the thinning atmosphere and sub-zero temperatures. These tasks require all but superhuman abilities. Triathletes and run-of-the-mill Olympic gold medalists need not apply. Would-be climbers of Meru need also possess more than precise knowledge, intuition, and strength. They must bring along some luck, too. Taking an ax to granite that is loose — or chipping into it at the wrong angle — can bring instant death. At a certain point during their painful and exhausting expedition, the trust between the three becomes nearly as strained as the ropes that connect them. Yet they know that any such distraction may prove fatal. At the same time, Conrad tries to keep his mind free of thoughts about past climbing partners of his who have died in falls. As their arduous adventure continues, Conrad, Jimmy, and Renan are challenged by debilitating injuries and other setbacks (e.g., a lingering snowstorm that depletes their food supplies). Will they be able to persevere? Every so often, we are allowed to catch our breath between this picture’s many dizzying shots . In these moments, we are guided by our own sherpa — Brookline-born mountaineer Jon Krakaurer. (One of his books was adapted into the Oscar-nominated 2007 film, “Into the Wild.”) We also glean insights from family members of Conrad, Jimmy, and Renan. (“Meru” sounds an apparent note of male chauvinism, when Krakaurer describes Conrad’s spouse as being clueless about mountain climbing’s dangers.) As our climbers approach Meru’s summit, we half expect Zeus and his ilk to heartily greet them — and perhaps fete them at a banquet hall straight from “Lord of the Rings.” Or, will Meru once again prevail? “Meru” will be shown in Room 320, Jefferson Academic Center, Clark University, at 7:30 Thursday and Saturday, and on Sunday at 1 and 2:50 pm.
