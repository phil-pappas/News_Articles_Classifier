But the actress performed her own stunts: and as much as she enjoyed it, she gave herself — and maybe others — a few injuries.\n\"It’s thrilling, because I have no experience I may have accidentally punched a few people for real, but I think they kind of like it. The stunt guys loved it, they might get paid more, \" Ritter joked to Weintraub . \"I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it, I loved the stunt guys, the whole department. I was afraid, I think I went in thinking, 'Oh, they’re gonna think I’m a little girl and can’t do this' but they were so warm and so supportive and they just made sure I looked cool.\"\nNot that Ritter needs much help looking like a badass.\nh/t Collider , Vulture", "external_links": ["http://collider.com/jessica-jones-krysten-ritter-melissa-rosenberg-interview-nycc/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/MKztuY_t9_I", "http://www.vulture.com/2015/10/jessica-jones-sexuality.html"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:59:04.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
