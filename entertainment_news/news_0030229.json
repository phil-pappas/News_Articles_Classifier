The actress and mother of one admitted some intimate details about their nuptials during an appearance on KIIS FM's \"Kyle and Jackie O Show\" . \"Sam and I got married nearly a year ago, on the 28th of December,\" she revealed. \"It was very intimate. We just popped into Melbourne with Sam's family, and we just had 10 people in a house we rented.\" \"We wrote our own vows,\" Lara added. Lara, moreover, recalled how her pregnancy made it hard for her to find a wedding dress. \"I was in London right beforehand, so it was really cold,\" she shared. \"But I ended up finding a white Louis Vuitton dress. I was six months pregnant, so it was really chilled. I cooked lunch!\" Lara and Sam welcomed the arrival of son Rocket in March. \"Rocket was born in Los Angeles, and we live between the New York and LA,\" the beauty revealed. \"But being home in Sydney now is nice. It's nice to be home everyday, and be with my mum. Rocket has the most amazing grandmothers - Sam's mum and my mum have been awesome.\" — Kyle and Jackie O (@kyleandjackieo) October 11, 2015 \n© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:41:28.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
