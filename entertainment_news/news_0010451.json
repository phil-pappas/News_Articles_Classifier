PT1M9S http://www.smh.com.au/action/externalEmbeddedPlayer?id=d-43wg3 620 349 October 5, 2015 Full movies coverage \nThe first reviews of Spectre have landed from the UK, and they are uniformly raves. \nThe Times , The Telegraph and The Guardian have all lavished the 24th James Bond film with five-star ratings, while The Sun and the London Evening Standard raved without rating the film, dubbing their assessments \"first impressions\". \nMonica Bellucci with Daniel Craig in Spectre. \nAt any rate, the unanimous praise almost guarantees a monster opening in the UK for the fourth film starring Daniel Craig as 007 this weekend. Advertisement \nIn Spectre , Bond comes face to face with a ghost from his past in the form of Christoph Waltz's Franz Oberhauser, head of the secretive and up-to-no-good organisation SPECTRE (the Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion). \nIn The Telegraph , Robbie Collin wrote that \"ghosts of Bond films past come gliding through the film, trailing shivers of pleasure in their wake\". He praised the film's director Sam Mendes, who also made 2012's Skyfall , the most successful film in the long-running franchise with global box office of more than $US1.1 billion ($A1.38 billion), for what he described as \"a swaggering show of confidence\". \nCool as cucumber, sharp as ice: Daniel Craig in the 24th Bond film Spectre. \nKate Muir of The Times said the fourth outing for Daniel Craig as James Bond \"is achingly cool, as sleek and powerful as the silver Aston Martin DB10 that races through the movie\". \nShe added that Mendes and Craig now seemed so comfortable with the terrain \"that a relaxed wit percolates almost every scene. Their recipe, like the car, now seems to be bulletproof\". \nFor The Guardian , Peter Bradshaw described the film as \"pure action mayhem with a real sense of style\" and called it \"a terrifically exciting, spectacular, almost operatically delirious 007 adventure\". \nCould the latest Bond film shatter the record set by the last, 2012's Skyfall? \nThe Evening Standard 's Ben Travis said \"director Sam Mendes has, against all the odds, delivered a film that at least matches, and perhaps even betters, Skyfall \", while The Sun 's showbiz reporter Ed Dyson effused that \"all the classic elements fans expect from Bond await in Spectre â€“ and then some\", adding that \"we were expecting you to deliver Mr Bond... and you certainly didn't disappoint\". \nWhat does disappoint, though, is the fact that Australia will have to wait until November 12 for its chance to similarly froth in collective excitement. \nHurry up, Mr Bond. We've been expecting you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T13:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T09:42:48.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
