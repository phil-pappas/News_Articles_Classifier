For, director Gadda Viji’s latest hopes to entertain its audiences. If only Viji — who seeks to probe into “prisoners of mind”— had vested in Plus the same positivity and proficiency!Plus is peopled with multiple ideas and revolves around those afflicted with psychological problems. If Ritesh suffers from narcissist personalist syndrome, Vivek suffers from misophonia and Nidhi from hemophobia. Mind-boggling madness? You said it. But the end result is far from satisfying. In his bid to provide a new spin to an otherwise stale tale of how a man, betrayed by his friends, meticulously avenges the wrong done to him, Viji simply confuses his audience. Plus revolves around Dev, a business magnate and philanthropist. While cop Kishore, pursuing the case of an attempted murder, seeks to unravel the puzzle behind the mysterious attacks and deaths, you have Vivek, Ritesh and Nidhi enacting their own drama to see Kulkarni, Subbu, Ranka, the doctor, who cheated Dev (aka Jai) and killed his scientist wife who discovers vaccine for mental problem, meet a grisly end. While veteran Anant plays his part with flamboyance, Ravi Shankar scales up on merit. But the others turn out mere caricatures, failing to deliver. Plus, promoted by Yograj Bhat, turns out a totally minus, mindless time at movies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T18:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:59:31.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
