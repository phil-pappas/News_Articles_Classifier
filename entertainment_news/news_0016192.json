He loves Sofia and wants to give her whatever she wants, but the guest list has gotten completely out of hand and the whole thing has turned into a huge production. [He's trying to] remind Sofia what the day is really all about.'' \nThe 'Modern Family' actress recently admitted she is very involved in the planning process. \nAsked if she has become a so-called bridezilla, she said: ''I think I am beyond that. \n''I am very detail-oriented so I am kind of like a nightmare. I have a very good memory. If you show me swatches of things, I can in two months exactly remember, 'What happened with the one with the little border that had the little print?' I'm like, really bad.'' Contactmusic", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:08:38.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
