Speakers at the protest said they want justice for people killed by police.. \nAccording to the Associated Press, the protesters walked past lines of police officers who had cordoned off a lane of traffic for them. As they moved, those with megaphones shouted stories of the slain as others waved signs with photos of the dead, mostly young black men, and the dates and places of their deaths. Quentin Tarantino vs the NYPD gonna be one of the greatest beefs of all time — cuillin (@notcuillin) October 26, 2015 \nTarantino told reporters he flew in from California for the protest to stand up for the victims of police shootings. \n\"I'm a human being with a conscience,\" he said. \"And if you believe there's murder going on then you need to rise up and stand up against it. I'm here to say I'm on the side of the murdered.\" \nThe protest was peaceful and there were no arrests. But the demonstration happened in the wake of another shooting of a New York police officer: Randolph Holder was shot to death last week while chasing a bicycle thief. A suspect has been charged with murder and robbery in the case. \nQuentin Tarantino holds a banner at protest of police brutality in New York Oct. 24, 2015.

It's time for a boycott of Quentin Tarantino's films.” \nA response from Tarantino was not immediately available. \nAlthough many of Tarantino's biggest hits — Reservoir Dogs , Pulp Fiction , Django Unchained — are indeed startlingly violent, he is considered an influential cinema auteur in Hollywood: He won directing Oscars for Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained . \nHis latest movie, The Hateful Eight , about bounty hunters in Wild West-era Wyoming, is due to open Christmas Day. \nOne of New York's pro-police tabloids, the New York Post , did not mince words about how it feels about Tarantino. Its front-page headline screamed \"Disgrace\" and featured a picture of a protestor (not Tarantino) directing a rude gesture at a nearby police officer.
