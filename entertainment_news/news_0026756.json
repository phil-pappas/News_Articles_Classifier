Show Caption Previous Next \nTEMPE, AZ - Two young actors have performed at small box theaters across the Valley, even toured in Broadway-sized venues across the country, but they have never performed at the one in their home town. Until now. \nRiley Glick, 14, and Ross Nemeth, 12, are not aspiring Broadway actors, you could call them professionals. They've both been cast in the ensemble of A Christmas Story, the musical , which comes to ASU Gammage next month. \nFor one performance each (which hasn't been determined yet), the Scottsdale natives will sing and dance on the same stage looking out into the audience where they've both sat and watched numerous Broadway shows before, imagining the day they would find themselves standing center stage. \n\"It's been a dream of mine to perform at ASU Gammage and now I get to,\" said Nemeth, who spoke to me very briefly over the phone Friday night because he's in another show and it was about to begin. (He playing Michael Banks in Mary Poppins, which is at Don Bluth Front Row Theatre until Nov. 7). \n\"I didn't even believe my mom,\" he said recalling the moment he found out he'd been cast. \nGlick, who toured nationally with How The Grinch Stole Christmas, the musical, said she was \"super excited\" for the opportunity and called performing at Gammage \"so special.\" \nOn. Oct. 3, about 50 young aspiring actors arrived at Gammage to audition for a \"one-in-a-lifetime\" chance to be in the Christmas movie turned show. They turned in their registration forms, were taught some choreography and then had to give it their all in front of a casting director. \nAre they nervous for their Broadway homecomings? A little, but more excited and anxious to learn from the show's Dance Captain, Brooke Martino. \nA Christmas Story, the musical , will be at ASU Gammage from November 24 to 29.
