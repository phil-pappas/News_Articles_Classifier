After reading a heartfelt plea on Facebook, a woman donated her kidney to a stranger. Louise Drewery, 37, was scrolling through her news feed when she saw a message that caught her eye.It read: \"Good evening ladies and gents, is there anyone out there that would like to donate a kidney to help my daughter?\"She has kidney disease and needs a transplant as soon as possible. She is the mother of our three-year-old grandson and finds it hard to function properly because of the illness.\" \n© Etienne Ansotte/REX Shutterstock \nStacey's dad posted a heartfelt plea online The poorly lady in question was 26-year-old Stacey Hewitt, a mum of one from Redcar, who was suffering with kidney failure. Her loving father Darren had sent the message on Facebook in the hope someone could help.Incredibly, Louise was so moved that she offered to donate her kidney to Stacey despite having never met her.She told The Daily Mirror : \"My husband Nigel and I were just sitting one night having a glass of wine and we went on Facebook. When I saw the message I knew that if I could help, I would.\"People ask me if it's for family or a friend, but they're shocked when I say it's for a total stranger. But Alfie is only little and deserves to have his mum.\"My biggest fear was not waking up [from the operation] and my kids being without a mum, when the reason I'm doing this is so another child isn't living without a mum.\"After months of tests and hospital trips, Louise, from Scunthorpe, found out she was a match for Stacey. Since the surgery at The Freeman hospital in Newcastle, the pair are recovering well – with Stacey saying she has a new lease of life thanks to her \"absolute hero\" Louise.Stacey could barely walk before the transplant, and had an uncertain future. She said: \"It's amazing and I can't thank Louise enough. She could have backed out at any moment. It takes a lot of guts to give an organ to someone you don't know. It's a nice bond we have now.\"Professor Derek Manas, director of the institute, told the newspaper: \"A lot of people just want to give to humanity and it has opened my eyes. It's amazing that people are prepared to do this.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:32:42.158+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
