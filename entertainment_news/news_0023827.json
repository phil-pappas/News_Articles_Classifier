The diva includes a portion of the track in a recently-released ad for her fragrance \"Ari by Ariana Grande\". Set in 1950s-era New York City, the ad finds Grande sitting in the back of a vintage taxi while spraying her perfume, striking some poses and whipping her hair. Based on the brief snippet heard in the clip, her forthcoming song will likely sound a lot like her 2014 hit \"Problem\" on which saxophone played prominent role. \"Focus\" is scheduled to finally come out on October 30 as the lead single off Grande's third studio album \" Moonlight \" which has yet to have an official release date. \"When I say focus on me I'm not asking to be the center of attention. I'm not asking you to focus on my clothes or my face or my body or my singing voice,\" the former Nickelodeon star recently said of the song. \"By focus on me I literally mean focus on me, on what I'm all about, on what I believe in.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T09:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:39:02.108+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
