On October 3 rd , a group of Chinese Canadians staged a second music and dance performance entitled\"Chinese Heart, Ode to Peace\" in Toronto, Canada , in remembrance of this event and of the founding of the People's Republic four years later as well as to call for the prevention of further wars and defend peace. The event received support from all sectors of the community in Toronto .\nThe show consisted of seven programs: Homeland, Fighting, the Yellow River Cantata, Heroic, Life, War Review and Epilogue, which were performed in a variety of forms, including song, recitation, dance, martial arts and chorus. Notably, the Yellow River Cantata offered an unprecedented chorus song with the participation of 200 performers, supported by a symphony orchestra of 50 musicians. The show, held at the Living Arts Centre in Mississauga , provided an inspiring art experience for the over 1,100 spectators onsite.\nLeMine Initiative, the organizer of the event, said that they decided to stage the show again as a result of the far-reaching social impact of the first successful performance. Chinese Canadians from all across Greater Toronto worked in concert to present a musical extravaganza and dance epic by bringing together and coordinating the efforts of 3,000 individuals including the organizer, several co-organizers, participating groups and volunteer performer groups, in simulation of the cohesion of the Chinese nation that was brought to the fore during World War II 70 years ago. The renaming of the event to \"Chinese Heart, Ode to Peace\" also highlighted the deep love that each and every Chinese Canadian feels for their motherland.\nHistory cannot be forgotten, peace should be cherished, and national and patriotic sentiment shall last forever.\nVideo address:\nYoutube: https://youtu.be/Mu8DEC-8rZM\nTencent : http://v.qq.com/page/a/f/3/a0168pusaf3.html\nYouku: http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMTM1NTMzNDQ1Mg==.html?from=s1.8-1-1.2\nSohu: http://my.tv.sohu.com/us/270798382/81707792.shtml\n releases/chinese-heart-ode-to-peace-epic-show-staged-in-toronto-commemorates-the-66th-anniversary-of-the-founding-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china-300158770.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://my.tv.sohu.com/us/270798382/81707792.shtml", "http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMTM1NTMzNDQ1Mg==.html?from=s1.8-1-1.2", "http://v.qq.com/page/a/f/3/a0168pusaf3.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=CN26397&Transmission_Id=201510131130PR_NEWS_USPR_____CN26397&DateId=20151013", "https://youtu.be/Mu8DEC-8rZM", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chinese-heart-ode-to-peace-epic-show-staged-in-toronto-commemorates-the-66th-anniversary-of-the-founding-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china-300158770.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:11:41.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
