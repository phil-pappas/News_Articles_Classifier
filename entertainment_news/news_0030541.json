The new pulse riffle looks much the same as the one in the original film, but there are some additional features which make the weapon more sophisticated. \"We all knew there would be pulse rifles. Obviously. Now with added RIS,\" Blomkamp captioned the photo. Based on what the director wrote, the pulse riffle will be equipped with RIS, which stands for Rail Interface System. RIS allows users to attach scopes, lights or any other elements to the riffle. Although it's almost a year since the movie was first announced, details are still scarce and story is kept under wraps. Many people dub the film as \"Alien 5\", but it appears to be a direct sequel to the second film \"Aliens\" and will likely ignore the events of \"Alien 3\" and \"Alien: Resurrection\".

Official release date has yet to be announced, but the movie is expected to arrive in the U.S. in 2017. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Untitled New Alien Movie News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:18:28.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
