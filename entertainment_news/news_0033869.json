Photo: Supplied\nThey're the beeps, clangs, squeaks and clicks dropped into TV shows so often we've managed to ignore them completely … but hear one out of context and your brain will immediately jump to the exact series every time. Here's our top 10 iconic TV series sounds.\n1. The Law & Order clang\nIt's been called \"The Doink\", \"The Chung\" and (by series star Richard Belzer) \"The sound of [series creator] Dick Wolf's cash register\", but the real name for the two-beat noise that moves moments along in Law & Order , according to its inventor Mike Post, is the Clang. Just what is it? It's a mix of more than 10 sounds, including a judge's gavel, a jail door slamming and \"500 Japanese monks walking across a wooden floor\".\nAdvertisement 2. The General Lee's air horn\nIgnoring for a moment the highly-charged fact that The Dukes Of Hazzard car has a flag painted on its roof that many believe is a racist taunt, the best-known sound from the series (ignoring Sheriff Roscoe P. Coltrane's laugh) was the car's music air horn, which blew as the car sailed past police, usually overhead. The tune was the opening bars of Dixie , another southern American icon.\n#3 Skippy's tsk-tsk\nChances are, if you're reading this, you're in Australia. So go outside and wait for the first kangaroo to walk up (shouldn't take long) and have a listen. Despite what Skippy (the series) would have us believe, Skippy (the 'roo) is a pretty quiet type and that noise from TV doesn't exist. It's a \"vocal effect\" added in. Why? Because without it, you have an animal just standing there. 4. The 60 Minutes tick\nBefore this series kicked off in the 1960s in America, the sound of a stopwatch or clock counting down was most likely an indicator that a bomb was about to go off. On screen, at least. But now, throughout the Western world it's synonymous with current affairs, a sure sign someone is about to go under the spotlight and (we'd like to believe) Michael Usher's ringtone.\n5. Road Runner's beep-beep\nReal road runners – the ones that live in the American wild and charge about at high speed avoiding real coyotes – are part of the cuckoo family, eat lizards and make a noise not dissimilar to a chicken (it's true, they're on YouTube!). So what's that \"beep-beep!\" the cartoon version does? It's a sound Warner Bros artist Paul Julian made when he couldn't see where he was going. The cartoonists liked it and used if for their creation.\n6. The Star Trek transporter\nIt's a shimmery, sparkly, chimey sound that accompanies away teams as they make use of one of the Star Trek universe's true miracles, the transporter beam. But what made the noise? According to Ben Burtt, who recreated the sound for 2009 Star Trek film, at least part was a Hammond organ. He also used a set of studio chimes for his version, but threw in some Hammond for authenticity.\n7. The TARDIS\nIf ever there was an iconic sound in the TV world, it's the throbbing sound of Doctor Who 's TARDIS appearing or disappearing. It's instantly recognisable as something only a superior alien race could create … or, in this case, a BBC sound technician could create by scraping a set of house keys over piano wire, then adding static and a bit of reverb.\n8. The Family Feud bup-bow\nIt's just two bass notes descending, the kind of simple thing anyone could replicate on a keyboard, yet the bup-bow noise used in the quiz show when a contestant gets a question wrong has become so synonymous with failure, it's been played in countless other TV shows and movies and is now actually said by everyone from kids in the schoolyard to adults. And usually, it gets a laugh from anyone it's not aimed at.\n9. KITT's whirr\nKITT, the Knight Industries Two Thousand, the talking car David Hasselhof drove in Knight Rider , was a state-of-the-art crime-fighting tool equipped with offensive and defensive capabilities, more computer power than NASA and, for reasons that were never quite explained, a red flashing light that gave off a very distinctive \"whirr… whirr…\" noise every few seconds. Which is probably not very helpful when you're supposed to be undercover. Still, it did give the car a distinctive sound to go with the look.\n10. Samantha's nose tinkle\nGiven it was the 1960s, when women – even witches – were throwing off the shackles of the past, it was never going to be cool enough for modern witch Samantha Stephens (played by Elizabeth Montgomery) to wave a wand when she wanted to make magic in the series Bewitched . So what did the producers have her do instead? She wrinkled her nose. Which looked cute, but didn't have much impact. The solution? They added a small trill created by hammering the uppermost notes on a xylophone.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/TMlle0gBZ7Q?rel=0", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/1_S7sWVm3Mw?rel=0", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/0xqTG3Y4SEo?rel=0", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/zAKksqKR3pI?rel=0", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/-tAiQueaytM?rel=0", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/1OlCVNn9ZeY?rel=0"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:24:25.517+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
