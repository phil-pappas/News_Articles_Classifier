Why did this have to happen?\"\nSly said she has not been contacted by authorities.\nMultiple residents of the apartment complex reported hearing six gunshots. Billy Ray Kelly said he came out of the apartment he shared with Isaac after he heard the shots.\nThat's when he saw his nephew bleeding in the middle of the parking lot. Isaac Kelly's uncle could hear the security guard yelling \"stay with me.\"\nParamedics and Riverside County sheriff's deputies were called to the scene at the Meadowview II Apartments . The man was transported to a local hospital, according to the Sheriff’s Department news release.\nSheriff's Department officials would not say if the security guard was arrested in the shooting. Neighbors said they saw the security guard speaking with law enforcement officers.
