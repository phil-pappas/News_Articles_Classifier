But not all cities are created equal for those looking to find someone – whether to marry or just to be single together. With this in mind, Livability.com has named the Top 10 Best Cities for Singles, 2015 . These cities offer high concentrations of singles, lots of ways to meet new people, and plenty of options for that first, second or third date.\nWhen choosing the best cities for singles, our editors started by looking at places where there are plenty of singles to choose from, looking at the percentage of unmarried people, the percentage of the population in prime marriageable age (20 to 34), and places where large percentages are living alone – all Census data. Our friends at Esri then helped us find places where people are doing single-ish things. These cities tend to have higher-than-average rates of people who go to art galleries, bars, nightclubs and pool halls. They have more residents who are likely to dance, sing karaoke and go to romance movies. We subtracted points for places where people play a lot of computer games (Get out of the house, people.) and added points for people using dating sites and apps.\nFinally, our editors added in a couple of measures to find places that are good for everyone, like demographic diversity and cost of living.\n“Some people want to stay single. Some people don’t,” says Livability editor Matt Carmichael. “These cities are great for people who are single, as well as those looking to find someone not to be single with.”\nTop 10 Best Cities for Singles, 2015\n1.
