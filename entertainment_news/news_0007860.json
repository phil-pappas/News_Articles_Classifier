Among the SNL alumni paying tribute to Murphy are Tracy Morgan, Chris Rock, Jay Pharoah, Kevin Nealon and Joe Piscopo. \nThe humor prize honors those who influence society in the tradition of Samuel Clemens, the writer and satirist known as Mark Twain. Past honorees include Jay Leno, Carol Burnett, Tina Fey, Whoopi Goldberg, Ellen DeGeneres, Will Ferrell, Richard Pryor and Bill Cosby. \nMurphy gained national attention when he joined the SNL cast in 1980 at the age of 19. He went on to become the most commercially successful African-American actor in film history and one of the industry’s Top 5 box office performers overall, the Kennedy Center said. Murphy’s films have been among Hollywood’s highest-grossing comedies, including “48 Hours,””Trading Places,””Dr. Dolittle” and “Coming to America.” \nThe tribute will be broadcast Nov. 23 on PBS. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T22:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T03:28:56.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
