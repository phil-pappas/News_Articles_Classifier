The book is called \"The Pigeon Tunnel: Stories from My Life,\" and is being billed by the publisher as \"an exhilarating journey into the worlds of his 'secret sharers' — the men and women who inspired some of his most enthralling novels.\" Le Carre, the pen name for David Cornwell, has written nonfiction before. But \"The Pigeon Tunnel\" is the British author's first memoir. \nLe Carre, who turns 84 later this month, is known for such classics as \"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\" and \"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:57:45.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
