NYU said future events are in the works. \nWilliams is just one of many celebrities drawn to NYU. Here are a few others: Karlie Kloss A photo posted by @karliekloss on Sep 2, 2015 at 4:37pm PDT Instagram/@karliekloss \nFormer Victoria's Secret angel Karlie Kloss was nervous on her first day of school this year, proving that celebrities really are just like us. (If we were taller, perfectly toned, and our hair looked like spun gold.) Tavi Gevinson Oct 1, 2015 at 3:48pm PDT Instagram/@tavitulle \nPower teen Tavi Gevinson supposedly started at NYU this year, but how she added school to her life of producing a magazine endorsed by Jane Pratt and Ira Glass, starring on Broadway , speaking to massive crowds like a tiny cult leader and hanging with her friends and taking selfies like a mostly average teen is mystifying.
