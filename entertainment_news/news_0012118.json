Who's trying to steal a pen from a bank? It makes no sense!\"Webb then complained about the time he has been amounted during the debate, before host Anderson Cooper (Jon Rudnitsky) challenges him on his \"A rating from the NRA\", which silences the candidate. © NBC Universal After Sanders criticised Clinton's email scandal, he then said: \"What's the deal with emails anyway? I forgot my password the other day, so they say 'we'll email you a new one'. But I can't get into my email to get the password. I mean talk about a ball buster!\"Later, Sanders joked: \"I don't have a super PAC. I don't even have a backpack. I carry my stuff around loose in my arms like a professor between classes.\"Clinton said of Sanders: \"I get it, he's the song of the summer. He's 'Trap Queen' by Fetty Wap. But I'm the birthday song guys, and you're gonna be singing me until the day you die.\"As a final statement, Sanders said: \"I don't understand these podiums, what are you supposed to do with your elbows?\", before joking about being Clinton's future Vice President. © Getty Images / Steve MackTracy Morgan Saturday Night Live was hosted by Tracy Morgan, making his comedy comeback after being injured in a New Jersey car crash.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:22:57.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
