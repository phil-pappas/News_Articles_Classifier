He later died from his injuries. \nLamb of God returned to the country two years later and the frontman was arrested in connection with the death. \nHe spent more than a month in jail before being released on bail and returning to the U.S. \nBlythe later returned for the trial, admitting he had ignored legal advice which urged him not to go back to the Czech Republic. \nAfter leaving Prague at the end of his trial, Blythe posted a candid message on Instagram.com. \n\"I am leaving Prague now - I hope not to return for a long while,\" he wrote. \"This has nothing to do with this city, the people who live here, or the Czech Republic itself at all. This is a wonderful place, & many people have been kind to me... \n\"But for me it is a place of great sadness. While I am relieved that my innocence was proven & apparently I shall not be going to prison, I am in no way shape or form a happy man right now... A young man is still dead, & his family still suffers... \n\"Prague, it is an amazing place... I am leaving a part of myself here, I think... Now I will go home & try to see what good I can make come out (of) the destruction that occurred here - it is the only correct thing to do. Rest in peace, Daniel Nosek.\" Copyright WENN.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T22:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:04:45.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
