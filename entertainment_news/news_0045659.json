Capitol will release the album, which is a step in a different direction for the singer.\nKelley performed seven songs on Wednesday with his newly-formed solo band, including “I Ain’t Never Leaving Nashville,” “I Don’t Want to Live Without You” and a cover of Tom Petty 's “Southern Accents.” Kelley said the lyrics of the latter tune remind him of his father, who sold bibles to earn money for medical school, and also revealed that rock legend Stevie Nicks will be featured singing vocal harmonies on the recorded version of the song.\nThough Lady Antebellum recently announced they will take some time off after their Wheels Up Tour, Kelley assured the crowd that he is not leaving the hit-making trio.\n“I wouldn’t have done this without Hillary and Dave giving me their blessing,” he said. “Lady Antebellum will always be my focus.”\nHis album will also feature “Lonely Girl,” which Chris Stapleton wrote, and he closed his set Wednesday night by inviting Eric Paslay and Dierks Bentley onstage for a song called “The Driver,” which Kelley said was the track that got the ball rolling on the entire project.\nKelley will be a busy man during Lady A’s upcoming break, since he and his wife, Cassie, recently announced they are expecting their first child . But despite his full plate, he emphasized once again that the group will always be his musical home.\n“Lady Antebellum will never break up, mark my words,” he stressed. “But I wanted to step outside of my comfort zone.\"\nSo, You Think You Know Lady Antebellum?", "external_links": ["http://tasteofcountry.com/charles-kelley-wife-cassie-baby-boy/", "http://tasteofcountry.com/tags/chris-stapleton/", "http://tasteofcountry.com/tags/charles-kelley/", "http://tasteofcountry.com/lady-antebellum-break/", "http://tasteofcountry.com/tags/lady-antebellum/", "http://tasteofcountry.com/tags/dierks-bentley/", "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/6714622/lady-antebellum-charles-kelley-solo-album", "http://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/tom-petty/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/3_xPg3S2Bzk", "http://tasteofcountry.com/tags/eric-paslay/", "http://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/stevie-nicks/"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:25:20.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
