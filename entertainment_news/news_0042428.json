Follow us on Social Media Tweet Actress Supriya Pathak is all set to enter the show 'Jaane Kya Hoga Rama Re'.. The comic actress Supriya Pathak, who has made the audience laugh with her stints as Hansa Praful Parekh on the show 'Khichdi', is now all set to join Life OK's upcoming show 'Jaane Kya Hoga Rama Re'. The show will have some modern elements to the mythological show 'Ramayan'. According to a report from a daily supplement, Supriya didn't want to do TV show for now. But the script and story-line of the show convinced her to enter the show. She was impressed with its concept and thus couldn't refuse Shobhana's (producer) offer for this role. However, it's indeed a good news for her fans to see her back on television once again. We tried reaching Supriya but our efforts went futile. Stay tuned for more updates...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T11:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T06:47:29.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
