In a video posted by AMC, the stars and executive producers of \"The Walking Dead\" spin-off talk about what to expect in the next season. Dave Alpert hints that season 2 will see how Madison evolves and reveal her back story. Kim Dickens echoses Alpert's statement, saying that it's Madison's dark past that helps her survive. Nick is a drug addict, but Frank Dillane hopes that Nick will find a way to redeem himself. At the end of the first season finale, there's a glimmer of hope that they can escape this mayhem by heading west on Strand's boat, but their exact destination is not known yet. The stars claim they are kept in the dark about this too, but there could be more dramas on the boat. But can Strand be trusted? Executive producer and showrunner Dave Erickson promised, \"We will learn much more about Strand in season two.\" He added, \"What was interesting to us was to have a character you don't see very often on 'The Walking Dead' - somebody of means, somebody who has money, a person of affluence. And we see that is his house, that is his boat. He definitely has a con man's charm, which is part of how he accrued his wealth and his fortune, but he's not somebody without his own plans and designs.\" \"Fear the Walking Dead\" will return with 15-episode season 2 in 2016. In the meantime, fans can enjoy \" The Walking Dead \" season 6 which premieres Sunday, October 11 on AMC. The network also presents web series \"Fear the Walking Dead: Flight 462\" which premiered on AMC.com October 4 and will air new episode every Sunday. One of the characters on the web series will join the cast of \"Fear the Walking Dead\" season 2. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T10:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:34:32.350+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
