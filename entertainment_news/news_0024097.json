Bill Finch \nIt may be hard for you to imagine a world without butterflies. But for the past few years, we've come perilously close to losing what is likely North America's largest and most conspicuous butterfly population, the monarchs. \nAnd that's why I went to Point aux Pins, at Grand Bay in south Mobile County, to document the return of the monarchs this fall: Because I'm not sure what next October brings. \nMonarchs are, in a very real sense, the great American butterfly, because by midsummer, these tireless travelers inhabit every state and virtually every county of the United States. Yet they are in essence tropical creatures, and must retreat every year to warm refuge as far south as Mexico. And that makes them among the world's most spectacular migrants, gradually expanding over thousands of miles each year, and then suddenly returning across as many miles each fall. \nThat's why great flocks of monarchs, headed south, were once the surest sign of the arrival of fall across the continent. Thousands of monarchs roosting in trees each night along their southward migration route was as significant and as expected as the changing color of leaves in the trees. The Gulf Coast was considered a particularly grand place for viewing the migration, where butterflies were so numerous, the trees were noisy with the flapping of their tiny wings. Can you find all the butterflies on this flat-topped goldenrod at Grand Bay? Monarchs, buckeyes and one painted lady. And you just missed the two Gulf fritillaries that flitted off as soon as I walked up. Bill Finch \nWhat? You've never seen thousands of monarchs roosting in your trees? And that's exactly what worries me. \nSince the last recorded peak in the monarch population in the late 1990s, the monarch's overwintering population in Mexico has dropped by more than 95 percent. Since 2010, the number of monarchs surviving the winter in Mexico has been reduced by nearly half each year. \nAnd that's not the worst of it. We've only been keeping tabs on monarch numbers since 1997. And we started doing that because some folks said, Hey, there sure don't seem to be as many monarchs around as there used to be. Based on accounts of monarchs darkening the sky on fall migrations, most scientists believe that even the 1997 peak is a dramatic reduction from what monarch numbers were 100 years ago. \nThere's a new national movement to restore the monarch population, and there was the least bit of good news this year. Some estimate that this year's overwintering monarch population could be twice what it was last year. That sounds like a cause for celebration, until you consider that we're still 90 percent below the average of the last 20 years and we really haven't done anything to address the long-term decline. \nIn the Midwest and Northeast, where's a big effort to replant milkweeds, a critical food of monarch young'uns – the distinctively striped caterpillars -- as the butterflies advance across the continent. There are so many flowers to tempt a monarch to Grand Bay's savannas. Some butterflies go for the pink false foxglove, others for the many golden shades of golden road. Bill Finch \nSome may be tempted – as we in the South too often are – to sit back and let others get our monarchs back for us. But even if the efforts of those in the Midwest and New England help to build monarch populations, my bet is we won't see a significant revival in butterfly populations (locally or nationally) unless we on the Gulf Coast participate. Monarchs arrive in the southeast in early spring, and many describe the Gulf Coast as the monarch's spring nursery grounds. No wonder: Our woods were once unusually rich with food for monarch caterpillars, supporting more than 40 species of milkweeds and close relatives. Almost half of these, and perhaps all of the most important ones, were associated with the longleaf pine ecosystem that has now become so rare across the Southeast. The return trip in fall through the Southeast may be just as significant. In fact, there are new suspicions that a large number of monarchs didn't bother to make the return to Mexico, but instead spent much or most of the winter within a mile or two of the northern Gulf Coast. The spectacle at Grand Bay may be one of the last remnants of that. From now through winter and spring, monarchs will be flying just where the slash pine savannas dip into the salt marshes and Mississippi Sound. \nIn these savannas, most plants seem to specialize in producing the kind of small, clustered flowers that butterflies appreciate. You know the kind of flowers I'm talking about. Those who believe they're still in Europe call them daisies. But on the Gulf Coast, we call them sunflowers, tickseeds, asters. Goldenrods and the purple wands of blazing star are closely related to the sunflowers and asters, and they are butterfly magnets this time of year. So is that amazing blue wildflower that some people call mistflower or wild ageratum. As the weather turns cooler, and these flowers recede, butterflies will stick by the hundreds to salt bush, or baccharis, as if their lives depended on it. At Grand Bay, the monarchs are acrobats, suspended between wildflowers. Bill Finch \nI've brought a little of all of these into my yard to attract butterflies, and it works moderately well. I've got fritillaries and monarch drifting drunkenly through my yard this time of year. But the honest to goodness truth is that there's nothing to compare to what's happening in the coastal prairies of Mississippi and Alabama, places like Grand Bay and Portersville Bay, where thousands of monarchs are beginning to assemble. \nIt's actually not clear why they are assembling here. Are they massing and feasting in preparation for a great trek across the Gulf of Mexico? Some may risk it, but most scientists say that it's hard to understand how and why the monarchs would fly directly across the Gulf. Is this the start of another long and arduous trek across thousands of miles of Gulf Coast lands, from Alabama to Texas to Mexico, that have been hammered by residential and industrial development? Or maybe they're actually going to stay put and brave the winter in that narrow strand of Alabama and Mississippi warmed by contact with the Gulf. Honestly, we don't know. But unless we want to imagine a world without America's butterfly, I expect we ought to start figuring that out, fast. Monarchs on tickseed sunflowers.
