The HSLANJ GLI makes it easier to afford this vital literature which directly supports patient care.\"\nManaged by medical librarian and HSLANJ Executive Director Robert Mackes , MLS, AHIP, the GLI is guided by a committee comprised of librarians from different-sized health facilities in the regions served.\nFounded in 1972, HSLANJ is a non-profit organization with the goals of encouraging the professional development and advancement of librarianship and improving the quality of library services provided by health care organizations in New Jersey.
