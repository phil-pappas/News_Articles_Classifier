Sandra Lee discusses breast cancer 1  /  1 Back to Gallery After undergoing breast cancer surgery in May and a follow-up procedure in August, Sandra Lee has resumed her busy schedule as the host of four cooking shows and the editor of Sandra Lee Magazine.\nOn Thursday, she was the headline speaker at Women's Night Out at Proctor's, an annual fundraiser to support women's health at Ellis Medicine . \nThe longtime partner of Gov. Andrew Cuomo , Lee confronted breast cancer publicly. She posted pictures on social media of dressing changes following a double mastectomy and a makeup-free selfie showing her gauze-wrapped torso following a second surgery in August.\nIn an interview last month, Lee told the Times Union the changes to her body helped her make a statement: Women are more than just their breasts.\n\"When you have a message it's important to share it,\" Lee said about her Women's Night Out appearance. \"It's our responsibility to take care of each other.\"\nThe medical community is mixed about when women should start getting mammograms; some say 40, others say 50. Medical opinion also varies on how the kind of breast cancer Lee had, a noninvasive form called ductal carcinoma in situ, should be treated, but Lee is adamant about early mammograms and aggressive treatment.\nAlthough she has no family history of breast cancer, she started getting mammograms well before she turned 40, and her cancer was detected during a routine screening. During a recent appearance on \"Good Morning America\" Lee said approaching cancer with a wait-and-see approach is \"absolutely ridiculous.\"\n\"It's like a terrorist that lives inside your body, and we're going to wait and see what it does? We know what it's going to do,\" Lee said.\nThe double mastectomy meant Lee didn't have to look over her shoulder going forward, she said. She will insist that her niece, just 25, begin mammograms this year. The technology also exists to examine breasts with sonograms that do not emit radiation the way a mammogram does.\nShe explained that she posted intimate photographs of her experience to reach her large fan base.\n\"One hundred years from now, no one will remember me laying in a hospital bed, showing people the other side. But it might be someone's great-grandmother who got a mammogram because I did that, and her cancer was detected early, and because of that they were born,\" Lee said.\n— Staff reports \nScreenwriter Black, Olympian engaged \nBritish Olympic diver Tom Daley and Oscar-winning screenwriter Dustin Lance Black have announced their engagement.\nThe announcement was published in The Times newspaper Thursday, but did not disclose a date for the marriage.\nThe 41-year-old Black is a writer and producer who won an Academy Award for his screenplay for the 2008 movie \"Milk\" about gay activist and politician Harvey Milk.\nDaley, 21, is a former world champion who first competed in the Olympics at the age of 14 and won a bronze medal at the 2012 Games in London, and his youthful exuberance made him a fan favorite.\nHe came out as a gay man in a YouTube video nearly two years ago, announcing that he was dating a man and couldn't be happier.\n— Associated Press \nKrasinski to star off-Broadway \nJohn Krasinski , who starred for nine years in NBC's workplace comedy \"The Office,\" is going back to one — onstage.\nThe off- Broadway Public Theater said Thursday that Krasinski will make his theatrical debut in playwright Sarah Burgess ' \"Dry Powder,\" which offers a behind-the-scenes look inside a private equity firm.\nThe Public says the play is \"about the people molding and messing with the American economy\" and \"about the price of success and the real cost of getting the deal done.\"\nThomas Kail , who has directed \"Hamilton,\" \"In the Heights,\" and \"Lombardi\" on Broadway, will direct. Previews begin March 1.\n— Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:14:46.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
