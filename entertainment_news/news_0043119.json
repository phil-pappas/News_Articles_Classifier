For the first time I saw a male role that had that opportunity.\" © BBC / Kudos/Nick Briggs River stars Skarsgård as John River, a police detective haunted by 'manifests' of the dead. The award-winning actor told DS that he became interested in moving into television because of the lack of \"character-driven\" projects in modern cinema.\"Films that are made now either have a budget of $100 million - and are meant to basically sell as much popcorn as possible - or you have the $3 million films that only circulate festivals.\"The cinemas don't really show any films that are character-driven anymore. There's no market for it, and so all the talent from those films - the good writers, the good directors, the good actors - are now going into television.\"One of his few previous jaunts into TV was a three-episode stint on Entourage in 2008, an experience that Skarsgård described as \"horrible\".\"I did a guest appearance on Entourage. That was horrible, because I'm used to analysing the characters, working with all the details... and they said, 'No no no, walk and talk, walk and talk! It's energy energy energy!' - so it didn't quite suit me.\" © BBC / Kudos/Nick Briggs He's turned down TV roles in his native Sweden too, including cop shows, but accepted River because \"it's a police story, but that doesn't matter much\".\"I've been offered some of those police stories in Sweden, but we do so many - Wallander and Beck and whatever it is. Some of them are very good and you probably see the best ones [in the UK].\"But there's so much of it and I'm not interested in police stories. I'm not interested in 'who did it' - this being a much more internal story about a man, and his difficulties in surviving in a reality that doesn't accept people that are different, is more interesting to me.\"River begins tomorrow night (October 13) at 9pm on BBC One.10 TV shows you must watch this week: The Apprentice, The Walking Dead and TFI Friday returnWatch the trailer for BBC One's River below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T10:17:54.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
