While she and her family (and their camera crews) publicly dropped everything to be by his bedside, this is the first time she has officially spoken out about the incident.\nTaking to her website , the 31-year-old said: \"The past week has been incredibly difficult. I am so thankful to family, friends, and fans, who have sent nothing but prayers and well wishes to Lamar. I also want to take a moment to thank everyone at Sunrise Hospital, including the amazing doctors and nurses for their kindness and diligent work. Under their amazing care, incredible strides have been made. You can never be prepared for an experience like this, but without the outpouring of love and endless prayers that Lamar has received and the strength I was given from my loved ones, it would have been difficult to endure. Thank you for your continued support. God is great!!!\"\nWhile Khloe has reportedly cooled her relationship with 26-year-old NBA player James Harden to look after Odom in his time of need, staying at his side as the LA Laker gets relocated back to LA for rehab, one of his former teammates has another take on the situation.\nMetta World Peace says \"not every Kardashian\" needs to be at Lamar Odom's side https://t.co/VNWdPiGYG1 pic.twitter.com/bB8VYOTJKy\n— Huffington Post (@HuffingtonPost) October 20, 2015\nAccording to Us Weekly, Metta World Peace (Ron Artest) said: \"The only Kardashian that needs to be there is Khloe. “Not every Kardashian needs to be around. They need to keep it simple, so Lamar’s children can see him whenever they want to see him. They’re waiting in line to see their own father... This is nothing against Khloe. This is for the celebrities that are coming to see Lamar. They should know they're taking away from Lamar's children.\"\nOdom has a 17-year-old daughter Destiny, and a 13-year-old son Lamar Jr. with ex Liza Morales.
