Sarah Ivens , @SarahIvens 8:29 a.m. EDT October 2, 2015 The view of the art show from the author's bedroom (Photo: Sarah Ivens) 291 CONNECT 8 TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nI used to be cool, which is hard to believe seeing as I now spend my time barking like a fishwife at my children in public parks or scrubbing Nutella off upholstery. But once upon a time I had a smidgeon of street cred, listening to new artists on WDJX FM (rather than Wheels on the Bus on repeat) and choosing shoes for their beauty rather than their 0-60 MPH toddler-chasing capabilities. \nThankfully, there is still a brief moment in time when I am where the party’s at. Literally . That time is this weekend, as the St James Court Art Show sets up outside my window… and most of its 300,000+ excited visitors stare in that aforementioned window for an uncomfortable amount of time, assuming that my home is somehow part of an avant-garde art installation. \nI live on Belgravia Court, the walking court that crowns Kentucky’s biggest art festival, when over 700 artists from around the country gather to sell their finest work in the nation’s largest Victorian preservation district. St. James Art Show: Times, live music & more \nNow in its 59th year, the show was originally established to provide funding to maintain the St. James Court grounds and fountain, and the proceeds from the show continue to allow St. James and Belgravia Court Neighborhood Associations to fund ongoing beautification efforts, the famous gas lamps and charitable contributions to Old Louisville institutions such as Shakespeare in Central Park, The Conrad-Caldwell House and The Cabbage Patch Settlement House. \nIt was my family’s first art fair last year, having just moved to the city a few months before, and we contemplated leaving for the whole weekend. Thousands of strangers strutting through our sweet little street, littering and yelping? No thank you! \nHello, art lovers! The author's children as art exhibition. (Photo: Sarah Ivens) \nBut our charmingly persuasive new neighbors urged us to stay and embrace the chaos — and to volunteer to try and reduce it — and it was the best decision we ever made. The art show is Old Lou’s Derby Day and Holiday Season rolled into one. It’s noisy, joyous and exhausting. As each exhibitor sets up his booth, it’s like unraveling a giant Christmas gift on your doorstep, with lots of oohing and aahing. \nAnd of course, unlike the art lovers who venture to our hood for perhaps the only time all year, we don’t have to battle to find a parking spot or stand in line for a Porta-Potty. \nEvery morning during the fair, we gather at sunrise in a neighbor’s cobble-stoned backyard for hot coffee, Nord’s donuts and a chat with the artists, before everyone gets on with the day. Every evening finishes with a celebratory glass of champagne or bourbon, a toast to the day’s success and a great tradition. The hours in between are spent rushing around hosting friends, helping the artists replenish their stock and offering them the use of our restroom. \nPorch life during the art show (Photo: Sarah Ivens) \nConnie Light, the director of Belgravia Court’s art show operation, has lived with the fair for 50 years; her husband Ric is the second longest tenured resident on Belgravia and St. James. “Every eyeball we can get on our neighborhood improves its chance of survival,” she says, referring to the much-needed funds the art show provides for its preservation. \nBut that isn’t to say living in a public fish bowl for three days doesn’t have its challenges. \n“A few years ago during the show, Ric and I were sitting in the living room, chatting with friends, when the front door opened and a woman walked in. I smiled, assuming she was a colleague of Ric’s, and she smiled back. Ric smiled, assuming she was a colleague of mine. Then she marched over to the fireplace, took an ornament off the mantelpiece and turned it over, inspecting it. ‘Do we know you?’ Ric finally asked her. ‘No, I’ve never shopped here before,' she replied, to which Ric politely asked her to leave.” \nOur porch was something of a popular picnic spot last year. Every time we wanted to venture out we’d have to fight our way through families having a leisurely lunch on our swing or front steps, who’d tut when we asked to get past, interrupting their feast. \n\"What do you mean we can't do this every weekend?\" (Photo: Sarah Ivens) \nOthers would stare through our bay window, much to my children’s amusement, discussing our chandeliers as my offspring waved. “My art party is the best,” William, 4, squeaked all weekend assuming, as any egotistical pre-schooler would, that all the commotion was centered around him. “I don’t want it to ever end.” \nHe has asked every weekend since the artists packed up and left when they’d be back. I am so happy to tell him that time is finally here. \nThe wonder of the St. James Court Art Show is something that has to be experienced to be believed. As a visitor, it is a chance to wander under a canopy of majestic trees with a beer in one hand and a bag of homemade fudge in the other, while your senses get bamboozled with all the beauty and creativity on display. \nFor us folks who live amongst it, it is a time to build strong neighborly bonds, chat with photographers and craftspeople who love the beauty of our court’s architecture as much as we do … and learn the art of bartering. \nLast year, we struck up a deal with the glassblower in the booth two feet from our front door: a beer and a sit down in return for a bauble of his choice. In our dining room now, rests a bowl full of jewel-colored crystals to remind us of this new friendship (we’ve stayed in touch) and a great weekend. A weekend that delicately paints new stories onto the 130-year canvas of this unique area. \n“One of my favorite art show moments occurred a few years ago when I was sitting out on the court,” Connie Light reminisces. “These two blue-haired ladies stopped, looked around in awe and one said, ‘you know, this would be such a pretty neighborhood if it didn't have all these tents in it!’\" \nShe’s right. Belgravia and St. James look much more beautiful without the tents, but they sure bring a lot of energy and inspiration — as well as much-needed funds — to Louisville’s historic and artistic heart every first weekend in October. \nSarah Ivens can be reached at (502) 582-4502 or sivens@courier-journal.com. \nIF YOU GO:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T15:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:22:04.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
