The new change is in the emoticons that will be available. As a Christian one endeavors to be positive about everything. That is not always possible. Some things rub you the wrong way and you have to voice your objections. Springfield friends feel free to do this all the time. They just use the comment area.\n3.bp.blogspot.com Are we so lazy that we cannot type a few words stating, \"I disagree.\" Yes that takes longer than one click. Expressing empathy or saying, \"I feel your pain.\" can also be done with a fair amount of speed. Technology is supposed to make things easier for us, but do we really want to make it that easy to be a hater?\nNot everyone who disagrees with you is a hater. Sometimes they have thoughtful objections to your views. Others just want to rant, rave and call you names. The comment button can also be used for this. There is even an area for your comments on this page. If you disagree, you can voice that below. You can also use this device to be disrespectful.\nThis brings to mind the idea that most people have that if you do not agree with them, you are wrong. As Christians truth is judged by how God views it in the scriptures. For people who believe in another religion they may disagree because of the teachings that they follow. To argue against someone's religious beliefs often leads to hard feelings.\nOften people do not have an answer, when asked what the proof is of the truth of a statement that they have made. \"Everyone knows that is true.\" Is another statement that cannot be used. Many times the other individual believes that everyone who is intelligent believes the way they do. Science can be used to prove or disprove some statements, but in the realm of religion and politics science is often useless.\nA good example of this is the origin of the universe. Those who believe in a creator cannot prove scientifically that anything was actually created. If it cannot be made by man the assumption is that God or some supreme being made it. To call anyone stupid because they believe that something came from nothing will not gain any acceptance. Your audience will turn on you in a moment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T20:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:00:55.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
