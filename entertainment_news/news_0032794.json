You're on TV.' That just really felt awkward to me,\" Gordon-Levitt told ABC's Nightline . \nGordon-Levitt, who plays French tightrope walker Philippe Petit in the new film The Walk, in theaters now, fell in love with acting as a child, and his portrayal of a man/child alien on the TV sitcom Third Rock From the Sun made him a reluctant star. \n\"I privately wished that we could go on set and do the work that I loved, but then burn the film afterward so that people wouldn't see it or recognize,\" Gordon-Levitt said. \nEven today, Gordon-Levitt keeps his private life out of the spotlight and says very little publicly about his new baby with his wife, technology entrepreneur Tasha McCauley. Being a new parent has made him feel more optimistic, he said. \n\"I look at my son and I say he's awesome. He's gonna grow up and he's going to do such incredible things. But here's the thing -- and this is why I feel private -- I don't want him to feel the pressure of me having been on TV and saying that,\" Gordon-Levitt explained. \n\"'Cause what if he just wants to, you know, go off and live in Tibet and be a monk and never be heard from again? I wanna support that and I want him to feel encouraged to do that. And I don't want him thinking like, 'Oh God, my dad went on TV and told the world that I was gonna do great things. And you know what? I actually don't wanna do anything that the world is ever gonna really hear about,'\" Gordon-Levitt continued. \"I'd like him to be able to speak for himself when he gets old enough. And I don't know if it's really my place to speak for him.\" \nFor his latest film role in The Walk , Gordon-Levitt spent eight days training with Philippe Petit on a real tightrope. Petit captivated the world in 1974 when he sneaked into the World Trade Center, rigged a cable between the twin towers, and walked back and forth 1,362 feet above ground without a net. \n\"I think my parents never emphasized fame,\" said Gordon-Levitt. \"They never emphasized, ‘Ooh, look, isn't this exciting? Everyone knows your name. You're gonna make so much money,’ you know. I think if you chase after, you know, fame and money, it's sort of a recipe for unhappiness,\" \nThe actor continued, \"But if instead -- like [Petit] -- you're really just driven by what it is that you're doing. You know, he didn't make any money doing the walk. That's not why he did it.\" \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio. All rights reserved.
