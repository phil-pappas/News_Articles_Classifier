In the last one year, I realised that I am not doing the films that I can do. I started feeling lazy even though I have the energy and the habit to work hard,\" Shah Rukh said in an interview on the sets of 'Dilwale' here.\nThe actor is working round-the-clock at Ramoji Film City to finish the Rohit Shetty film for its scheduled December 18 release. He will fly down to Mumbai for his birthday, which will be a quiet family affair barring the launch of 'Fan' trailer.\n\"I want to do different films and I want to do lots of such films like I used to do earlier. I have decided that from the age of 50 to 55, I will do 15 really nice films. The target is to do three movies a year but I manage to reach two and a half. I want to do a mad film like 'Dilwale'.\"\nRecalling the advice of actor Deven Verma, Shah Rukh said, \"Deven sir had once told me that you should do three types of films, one for the body (tann), one for the money (dhan) and one for the soul (mann). 'Chak De' was 'mann ki film', 'Fan' and Gauri Shinde's next are 'mann ki films'.\"\nThe actor, who first worked with Shetty in 'Chennai Express', said 'Dilwale', which has been produced by his banner Red Chillies Entertainments, is a wholesome entertainer.\n\"'Dilwale' will give you a happy time. It has action, romance, comedy. It is like the superhero films of the west, they are designed for the audience to come and have a good time.\"\nShah Rukh is also confident that his onscreen chemistry with Kajol will suit the tone of the movie as the audience will see them in a different set-up.\n'Rohit thought that we have not done a film like this. We play our age. I think the combination is good. Kajol is very choosy about the movies she does and she has never been in a comic-action film before.'\nShah Rukh was full of praise for his other frequent collaborator, Johnny Lever.\n\"Johnny bhai is our senior and we respect him a lot. He is the first person to come on the set and a great inspiration to all of us. He is my favourite actor in the world. He always comes up with something new. He is great in the film.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:45:53.950+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
