So much so that he does not mind wearing the clothes that his character dons, day in and day out. In his last three public appearances, the star was spotted sporting the khaki uniform and red gamcha, much to the surprise of everybody around him. When he went to meet his brother Chiranjeevi and nephew Ram Charan at their residence on Sunday, he was wearing the same uniform and this has caught the attention of everybody in tinsel town.\nTaking a cue from his Bollywood counterparts, Kalyan is promoting his film while shooting, creating maximum buzz among his fans and audiences. According to a source, he's ensuring that his character has maximum recall value before the film's release. \"Kalyan liked how Aamir Khan, during the release of Dhoom 3, made all public appearances in a bowler hat, which was an essential part of his character in the film. Since he's playing a cop, he thought why not wear the khaki uniform wherever he goes,\" a source from the film's unit told Mirror.\nThe regular shooting of the film, which has not been going the way it was anticipated, has resumed after a brief break. The team had to stall shooting after cinematographer Jayanan Vincent walked out of the project due to an alleged clash of opinion with Pawan and film's director Bobby. Despite shooting for over two months, the team has only managed to shoot two action sequences and one song featuring Raai Laxmi alongside Kalyan. Kalyan has assured that the film will release as originally planned during Sankranti festival next year.\nMeanwhile, the 44-year old star, who has been at loggerheads with his brother over the last few months, finally buried the hatched when he met him on Sunday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T06:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:06:22.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
