People started singing the superstar’s track “Perekedza Mwana” as the musician went off the stage. \nTuku performed for about 20 minutes before the choir had to do more songs. \nMadziyire later took to the stage to announce a surprise for one of his members, Wellington Kwenda. He revealed that he had bought Kwenda a car valued at $9 000. \n“I want to honour someone who has been with us since day one. He has a passion for music and I am so humbled by his works. I am giving car keys to Wellington Kwenda, he didn’t know but I want to thank you my brother. Now you can drive your own car,” he said. \nSpeaking at the sidelines of the event Madziyire said he was happy with the turnout. \n“As I always say, it is all about Jesus and I am happy with the turnout and may God bless all those who came. This is a dream come true, launching the book and the festival. This is what the people have been waiting for. We continue to grow each day. This is our first festival as many are used to the live DVD recordings. We promise to do more and improve each time,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:51:06.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
