Source: Supplied\nThe garden is made up of 300 Lindt chocolate blocks, 15 kilos of chocolate gravel, 47 kilos of flavoured chocolate, 215 kilos of milk chocolate and 152 kilos of dark chocolate. More than 100 litre of liquid chocolate has been used to paint the walls and floor.\nThe shopping centre’s air conditioning is set at 22 degrees, so the chocolate doesn’t melt.\nThe chocolate garden was designed by gardening expert and Gardening Australia presenter Sophie Thomson, along with Bracegirdle and Edible Blooms .\nThe chocolate veggie patch. Source: Supplied\n“It’s like something out of Dr Seuss, really,” Ms Thomson told news.com.au. “You wouldn’t be able to tell that the celery and carrots are made from chocolate.\n“One of my favourite parts of the garden is the rainbow tree. It has seven main branches all painted different colours and on each branch are balls of chocolate.\n“Each branch has its own colour and is on a turntable, so it spins around slowly,” she said.\nAround 322kg of mint-flavoured Lindt balls have been used in the garden. Source: Supplied\nMs Thomson says it has been incredibly rewarding to work on such a worthwhile project.\n“Just seeing little kids going through it and their eyes go wide, and the smell is amazing. The whole thing has been lots of fun and a wonderful opportunity to raise money for charity,” she said.\nWhile you can’t eat any of the display, there are chocolates available to purchase at the event. Visitors can also enter a competition to win a giant piece of the garden to take home and eat.\nThe chocolate garden is open from 10.30am to 5pm and it will be un Westfield Marion until Tuesday 6th October.\nSome of the chocolate creations from Edible Blooms.
