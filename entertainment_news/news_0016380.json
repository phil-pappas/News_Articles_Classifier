As you enter the soundstage or location, a person collects them. If you can't live without your gadget, don't enter the set. If you have to be reachable for your day-to-day professional proceedings, don't enter the set. \n\"People actually have to sign a paper.\" \nWaltz admits he subscribes to Tarantino's no-phone rules, and he insists the filmmaker is not joking around. \n\"You get fired,\" the actor explains when asked what happens to people who ignore the set rules. \"When somebody booted up a computer on set and it made that sound, Quentin got up and left without a word.\" \nWaltz adds, \"It's all part of a larger discussion, though. Our attention spans diminish more and more as we go on. Why does that happen? Because constant distractions, that's why.\" \nAnd the actor admits working with perfectionist Tarantino has heightened his own hatred of people's annoying habits, especially when they're watching films at the cinema. \n\"At the movies, I disagree with people munching nachos with some cheesy goo on top. Why would you spread a stink like that...? Nobody tells these people that they're not at home watching television.\" \nWaltz will next be seen as the villain in the latest James Bond movie, \"Spectre,\" which hits cinema screens in the U.K. this month and in the U.S. next month.
