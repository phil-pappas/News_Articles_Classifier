Here are our top tips to make sure you’re in with a good chance of getting tickets… \n1. Registration The first hurdle is an easy one - if you’re not registered with Glastonbury, then you’re not getting in. It’s already too late to sign up as a new user, but fans who are hoping to bag tickets can check if their accounts are valid here . Not registered? You’ll need to wait until the April resale. \n2. Preparation Tickets will go on sale here at 9am sharp on Sunday, so grab a cup of tea and set your alarm. Have the website open early, and begin refreshing with a few minutes to go until 9am. Eventually, you’ll reach a page to buy tickets which is when you… 3. PASTE over your pre-typed details \nLook, typing a 16 digit number under pressure is difficult, and unlike with other events, your tickets aren’t held as you take your sweet time checking the numbers over. Have your registration numbers and card number on a separate document, ready to paste across when the time comes. \n4. Unsuccessful? There are still other options… \nDon’t panic if tickets sell out. Glastonbury is a *huge* festival, and the April resale gives fan another chance to nab tickets. There are a number of ways to work at the festival, and Oxfam and Festaff both recruit volunteers for various roles nearer the time. MORE GLASTONBURY:   Glastonbury has already played host to Beyonce, and with a back catalogue of hits like Ri-Ri’s, she would surely prove just as much of a hit as Mrs Carter. Fans have been calling for the band to play the festival for years now and with Christine McVie back in the group, next year seems as good a time as any for them to finally give them what they want. Kylie was originally booked to headline in 2005, but was forced to cancel after being diagnosed with breast cancer. Having proved that she’s still got what it takes at her recent Hyde Park gig, she deserves to play the set she never had the chance to. After two successful attempts at introducing rap to the Glasto crowd with Kanye West and Jay Z, surely it’s Slim Shady’s turn next? She played the Other Stage back in 2009, and seven years on Gaga is well overdue a return to Worthy Farm. They may have only last headlined in 2009, but Blur are hungry to do it again, admitting they wanted to replace Foo Fighters on this year’s bill. As her world domination continues, surely the next logical step for Queen Taylor is the Pyramid Stage? The rockers have already been linked to a spot on the Pyramid in 2016, having been forced to pull out of their headline slot this year after Dave Grohl broke his leg. Emily Eavis has previously admitted that booking Adele as a headliner would be a “complete dream”. With new music due for release, could 2016 be the year? The Matt Bellamy-fronted band are already one of the bookies top picks to be headlining next year, having previously done so in 2004. The disco troupe may be more suited to the traditional ‘legends’ slot, but with hits such as ‘Freak Out’, ‘My Forbidden Lover’ and ‘Good Times’, Chic would be sure to bring the party. The robotic duo would be the perfect Friday night act to whip the festival up into a frenzy ready for two more days of music. Because it would be utterly incredible, right?  Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T18:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:21:18.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
