(Photo: WILL OLIVER, EPA)\n10 CONNECT 18 TWEET LINKEDIN 5 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Johnny Depp is at the top of industry watch lists for a best actor nomination this year, but that may be enough for the Black Mass star.\n\"I don't want to win one of those things ever, you know,\" Depp tells the BBC . Why? \"I don't want to have to talk,\" he says, presumably meaning the A-list star would rather avoid bounding up on the Academy stage to speak before a billion viewers.\nBesides, he's been around the Oscar block, having earned best actor nominations for 2003's Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl , 2004's Finding Neverland and 2007's Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007).\"They gave me one of those things, like a nomination, two or three times,\" he says. \"A nomination is plenty.\"\nTell that to Warner Bros. Depp, who transforms impressively as James \"Whitey\" Bulger in the crime drama Black Mass , is currently on most experts' top five lists for a best actor nomination, according to awards site GoldDerby.com .\n\"The idea of winning means that you're in competition with someone and I'm not in competition with anybody,\" adds Depp. \"I just stick to my guns and do what I want to do. Sometimes people don't like it but that's alright.\"\nRead //usat.ly/1RD5I4y TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://usat.ly/1RD5I4y", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b8a0f9f6cf01983962fc3baf831d5161812ba71b/c=0-112-1807-2521&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/635802633523068842-EPA-BRITAIN-LONDON-FILM-FESTIVAL-76666900.JPG", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/34502627/johnny-depp-doesnt-want-to-win-an-oscar-but-a-nomination-is-ok", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RD5I4y&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c23594e5e2bdb9b820e8a9667c942804009f7aa7/r=264x400/local/-/media/2015/10/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/635802633523068842-EPA-BRITAIN-LONDON-FILM-FESTIVAL-76666900.JPG", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RD5I4y&text=Depp%20would%20rather%20not%20win%20an%20Oscar%2C%20OK%3F&via=usatoday", "http://www.goldderby.com/awardshows/experts/oscars-2015-nominations-nominations/best-actor.html", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/635802633523068842-EPA-BRITAIN-LONDON-FILM-FESTIVAL-76666900.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-13T00:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:12:17.464+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
