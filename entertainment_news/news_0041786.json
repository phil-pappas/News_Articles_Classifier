In the film, Michael J. Fox's character has a futuristic bottle of the soda delivered to him via pneumatic tube. While the outside of the bottle will be different, what's inside will be an already existing version of Pepsi made with real sugar. \"Pepsi fans asked and we heard them loud and clear,\" said Lou Arbetter, PepsiCo's senior director of marketing, in a statement. \"The 'Back to the Future' trilogy was as big a moment in pop culture history then as it is now, 30 years later. We are excited to be part of this moment and to bring fans something only Pepsi could deliver – and there's no need to wait – the future is now!\" \nThe bottle will be limited to a run of 6,500 and will be sold only while supplies last.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T08:28:43.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
