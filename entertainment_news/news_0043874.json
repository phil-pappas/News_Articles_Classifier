On October 17, BAO donors, board members, and supporters take to the streets of Crestwood for what development director Jamie Whitehurst calls \"adult trick-or-treating.\" Participants buy tickets for $35 and then start on their route, which includes eight theme parties within walking distance of each other. At each house, trick-or-treaters receive a playing card and can stay and enjoy the house's food and drinks. After visiting seven locations, participants head to the after-party, where they hand in their poker cards. The top hands will receive door prizes, and the party includes food, drinks, and music. Last year BAO raised $20,000 through the crawl, and all proceeds go to the organization.\nBAO recently celebrated its 30th year and all the changes the organization has gone through since their grass-roots formation in 1985. The charity now sits in a nondescript, but classic, building on 32nd Street South. They service around 800 HIV positive clients.\nSadly, HIV/AIDS is sweeping the South. AL.com reported that in 2010, nine Alabama counties exceeded the national prevalence. Some counties even doubled it. That same year, the state ranked tenth for the most newly diagnosed HIV patients. The Southern AIDS Coalition said that while southern states account for only 37% of the United States population, these states represent half of all new HIV infections. In 2012, the Alabama Department of Public Health revealed that there are 4,083 infected people in Jefferson County alone, but only 3,344 of them had been diagnosed HIV positive.\nAlthough BAO tests and offers assistance to everyone who comes through their doors, the non-profit enforces an income restriction that means most of their clients live in poverty. Many don't have transportation, family support, proper medical care, or a steady income. All they can rely on is the warm environment and staff at BAO. The front desk receptionist, or \"Diva in Charge\" according to her nameplate, is always laughing and smiling—a big difference from most clinic's white coats and cold demeanor.\nWhitehurst said the non-profit tests around 1,300 patients a year. He explained that poverty is a large factor in many of BAO's clients. People living in poverty may be unaware they have the virus and transmit it to all their sexual partners. Those partners, who could possibly be infected, pass it on. And so it goes.\nLuckily, HIV is treatable—but not curable. HIV lowers T-cells, or CD4 cells, in the blood, and replaces them with infected cells. AIDS is the last stage of HIV, but the goal for HIV patients is something doctors call an \"undetectable rate\"—when HIV levels in those T-cells are so low that many tests cannot pick up on them. Many believe that those with an undetectable rate of HIV will not pass the virus on to their sexual partners.\nThe first stop on the Crestwood Crawl is Urban Suburban, an antique store in Crestwood, because registration is outside on their sidewalk. The owners, Chris Feagin and Jeff Richardson, have participated in the crawl for five years. \"I've never known them to say no to BAO,\" Urban Suburban employee Rick Meriwether said about the owners. He said they have many friends that are living with HIV and have a close relationship with BAO workers. The two owners also are regulars at BAO Bingo , where they have donated gift cards and other door prizes.\nAlong with Feagin and Richardson's interest in BAO is their interest in Crestwood. They open up their store to crawlers because they are proud of their neighborhood, Meriwether said. Urban Suburban is open to shoppers while guests are starting their crawl, and Meriwether said that some of their regular shoppers have seen the fun and signed up for the crawl themselves.\nWhile we wait for a cure for HIV/Aids, whether it comes quickly or it takes years, places like BAO will still be fighting. And they'll still be playing bingo and crawling with poker cards.\nB-I-N-G-O! If you're looking for a little fun on a Monday, stop by BAO for Bingo night ! The first Monday of every month, BAO's basement turns into a bingo hall complete with a disco ball, pizza, drinks, and even an appearance by a drag queen or two. The night consists of six bingo games with cash prizes for each. Beware though–if you call a false Bingo, you will have to wear the dunce cap for the rest of the night. The event is BYOB–meaning if you got it, bring it. The organization has a permit from the city for bingo night so you don't even have to smuggle it in. Doors open at 6 p.m. and the games begin at 7 p.m.", "external_links": ["http://www.birminghamaidsoutreach.org/", "http://www.birminghamaidsoutreach.org/#!crestwood-crawl/c168s", "http://www.birminghamaidsoutreach.org/#!bingo/c1hzh"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:34:56.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
