Well, that picture we ran in 2002 in the D&C with the headline, \"ONE FOR THE THUMB.\" The Rhinos were coming off an amazing run of winning titles from 1998-2001. Another ring in 2002, a fifth one, would have completed it. We've all been waiting ever since. No ring. Maybe tonight we get it. So all you fans who used to come and all you local coaches, gather your teams and for one night stick a sock in your excuses. Bundle up. Bring your energy and let's see how it feels again to support your local pro team with the stakes this high, the big trophy on the line again. I think you'll be surprised.\nThanks,\nDevo", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T18:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:04:07.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
