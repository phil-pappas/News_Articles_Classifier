It will be a thirty-minute sci-fi short film. The short film is to introduce the viewer to the four principal characters, Aaron Steele, Azzure Steele, Jason Steele and Jackie Steele, while building suspense leading to learning who they really are. The story line contains murder, mystery, and comedy, all elements known to capture the attention of an audience. These elements are revealed through contemporary, high-energy, action-packed feats, which are enhanced using high-quality CGI and compelling special effect techniques.\nWhen the universe was created a billion years after three races came into being. The first race known only as the First. The second race known as the Quaians and the third race known as the Kellians. For thirteen billion years the Quaian and the Kellian lived in peace. Now their part of the universe is invaded by an evil race known as the Egavas. There is a hidden reason why the Egavas race wants the Kellian race destroyed.\nTo bring this science fiction short film to life, they launched this Kickstarter campaign . The goal of this project is to raise $500,000 by November 10, 2015. The funds raised will go towards production costs such as cast, crew, and equipment.\nPlease visit the Kickstarter campaign by clicking here . Perks will be delivered by December 2016.\nPlease keep in mind this is an “all-or-nothing” deal, which means if the campaign does not reach the funding goal then the project cannot move forward. So know that any amount given can make a difference, and this is an incredible opportunity to be a part of a special campaign! Help StoneClan Entertainment reach the goal by sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks. The more people know about this, the more support the campaign will receive.\nName: Robin C. Stone\nphone: 702-478-9492\nE-mail: This email address is being protected from spambots.
