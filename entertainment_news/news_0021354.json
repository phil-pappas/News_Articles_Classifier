The one hitch is that it is just too wholesome. \nThe film, based on actual events, evokes memories of everything from The Third Man to The Spy Who Came In From The Cold but what it lacks is their seediness and desperate pathos. \nSpielberg is dealing with duplicity and deception, with a war that does not involve \"men in arms\" but the spinning of information and misinformation. Somehow, he still manages to make Bridge Of Spies into a rousing flag-waver which celebrates the best of American values. \nThe film opens brilliantly with a chase/arrest sequence set in Brooklyn in 1957, at the height of the Cold War. Rylance plays Rudolf Abel, a Soviet agent who lives in a New York tenement and seems as dedicated to his painting as to his espionage. FBI agents are on to him. Spielberg's recreation of Fifties New York is meticulous. He portrays a city in which all the men, Abel included, have crew cuts and dress in jackets and ties. Amid such conformity, it is very hard for the Feds to keep track of their quarry as they follow him through the subway and across packed streets. \nAs a captured Soviet agent at a time of intense Cold War paranoia and fear about the bomb, Rylance's Abel becomes a figure of loathing for the American public. \nHanks plays James Donovan, a wily but idealistic insurance lawyer who was part of the American team at the Nuremberg trials. He is assigned now to take on Abel's defence. The idea is to give the Russian a show trial and then have him executed. \nWhat is intriguing about this part of Bridge Of Spies is how negatively it portrays the American public. As shown here, everyone from cops to senior judges has a lynch-mob mentality. The Soviet agent is the \"other\" and therefore deserves to die. When Hanks' lawyer protests that everyone deserves a defence, the cynical response from his bosses is \"don't go boy scout\". \nHanks plays Donovan in his best Clarence Darrow-like fashion. The irony, though, is that it is not his rousing speeches which sway opinion but his pragmatism. The Americans are busy spying on the Soviet Union. How they treat their Cold War prisoners is bound to affect the way the Russians treat any Americans who fall into their hands. \nIn the second half of the film, the action switches to East Berlin just as the Wall is being built. Donovan has been sent there as a hostage negotiator. He is operating in a private capacity as neither the US nor the Soviets want to acknowledge official ties. \nThe Berlin scenes, which see Donovan venturing through maze-like streets in search of his contact, the elusive Mr Vogel, have a Kafka-esque feel. \nAgain, in these scenes, Spielberg's craftsmanship is breathtaking. We are in a world of subterfuge and darkness. That is why the film's patriotic optimism ultimately seems so jarring. Spielberg, it seems, just doesn't do cynicism. \nBridge of Spies opens nationally on Thursday. \nBridge Of Spies \nStars: Tom Hanks, Mark Rylance, Alan Alda, Amy Ryan, Peter McRobbie \nDirector: Steven Spielberg \nRating: M \nReviewer's last word: Director Steven Spielberg's craftsmanship on Bridge of Spies is breathtaking, but he keeps the flag flying in his first Cold War drama. \nStar Profile: Mark Rylance \nQuirky fact: He was raised partly in Kent, England, and in Connecticut and Wisconsin, USA, where his father taught at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. \nBest known for: Wolf Hall, Blitz, The Other Boleyn Girl. \nIf you like this movie you'll like these: Trumbo, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, A Most Wanted Man. \nQuote: \"One of the pleasures of being an actor is you can live in a clear narrative that's moving forward from one position to another without such random and chaotic things happening.\" cold war", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:25:36.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
