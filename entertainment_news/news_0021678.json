Lucky London 007 fans got to watch Spectre and we were there \nPress Association 2014 / / National Entertainment News Share \nJames Bond is back and fans were in 00-heaven as the agent’s latest adventure, Spectre, was shown to the audiences for the first time. \nThe first ever screening of the movie, at the Odeon Leicester Square in central London, saw hundreds of lucky fans and press packed into the cinema, cheering and clapping as the closing credits rolled. \nLasting more than two hours, the 24th Bond film – which sees Daniel Craig in his fourth outing as the MI6 agent – was introduced by producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson. (Andrew Medichini/AP/PA) \nWith a thrilling opening scene set at the Dia de Muertos (Day Of The Dead) festival in Mexico, Spectre delivered intense chase scenes, romance and some witty one-liners from Bond and his gadgets guru Q, played by Ben Whishaw. \nBut the film – which follows the agent as he confronts enemies from his past, including his nemesis Franz Oberhauser, played by double Oscar winner Christoph Waltz – received mixed reactions following the screening. \nMany fans of the action franchise gave the latest adventure their approval with Heat’s Boyd Hilton saying: “It has all the elements of a classic Bond film. It’s satisfying for fans of the genre.” Promoted stories (Jonathan Olley/Metro-Goldwyn-May/PA) \nSuper-fan Helen Newman agreed, saying: “I loved it. It’s old-fashioned Bond. The humour is brilliant.” \nHowever, others were disappointed with the latest offering. \nDamon Smith, Press Association’s film critic, said: “From Skyfall to crestfallen. It was one anticlimax to another, although it was beautifully shot.” \nShowbiz reporter Steve Hargrave said Spectre was “solid and reliable but there were no real shocks or surprises”. (Andrew Medichini/AP/PA) \nITN’s Melissa Nathoo added: “It started phenomenally with an impact but it didn’t maintain it. It tried too hard but is still one of the better Bond films in recent times.” \nSpectre reunites Daniel, 47, with director Sam Mendes, after 2012′s Skyfall became the highest-grossing Bond film in history. \nHowever, it may be their last 007 adventure together, with the film maker saying Spectre is likely to be his last Bond film, while Daniel has also dropped similar hints. \nNaomie Harris, Ralph Fiennes and Rory Kinnear return for Spectre, alongside newcomers to the franchise such as Andrew Scott, Dave Bautista and Bond girls Lea Seydoux, Monica Bellucci and Stephanie Sigman.
