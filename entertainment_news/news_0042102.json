The video introduces the central character, Clary (Katherine McNamara), who discovers \"the truth about the world\" and finds out about her fate when she turns 18. \"Nothing is you thought what it was,\" she says, \"No one is who you thought they were.\" The video also introduces Clare's love interest Jace (Dominic Sherwood), her friend Simon (Alberto Rosende), fellow Shadowhunters Alec (Matthew Daddario) and Isabelle (Emeraude Toubia), as well as Magnus Bane ( Harry Shum Jr. ), the High Warlock of Brooklyn. There's also a glimpse of Luke (Isaiah Mustafa), a gun-toting werewolf. The freshman drama follows Clary who is thrown into the world of demon hunting with mysterious Shadowhunter Jace and her best friend, Simon, when her mother Jocelyn is kidnapped. Now living among faeries, warlocks, vampires and werewolves, Clary begins a journey of self-discovery as she learns more about her past and what her future may hold. Set to premiere in 2016, the show has been used by ABC Family to promote its new brand, Freeform. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T07:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:59:48.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
