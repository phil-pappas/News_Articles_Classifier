I am also struck by the way those who’ve been through it — intense and awful grief — really get it.\nOne of my friends, who also lost her Mom but at a much younger age, said the following amazing and wise words, which I would like to offer up to those of you in grief:\n\"Hi Taylor - I want to say that I totally get it and I'm sending you so much love. This is just so, so hard. For me, it's comforting to remember that the grief I feel is a reflection of the love I had. Often it's the hardest days that I feel the most connected to the memory of my mom. If I can, I try to take some time alone and go for a walk or a drive somewhere pretty and just let myself feel it. I'm sending you tremendous amounts of love. And I'm here for anything you need.”\nFor those of you in mourning, feeling grief or sadness, or just having a shi*** day, I am sending you light, love and courage, because we all in this together.\nBe the inspiration.\nNamaste!\nTaylor plus 5", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:03:47.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
