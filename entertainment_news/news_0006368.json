Don't follow for traffic you guys got a strong reputation”. \n“When reliable sources turn to tell Lies @Joy997FM was our last hope... Hope it's a fake account,” he added. \nHis tweets followed a story Myjoyonline.com published from an interview he granted Hitz FM in which he revealed that he does not readily grant interviews because he is now grown. \nThat decision, he said, has unfortunately made enemies for him. Many people, he said, see him as arrogant when in fact that is not the case. \nThe rapper, born Michael Owusu Addo, addressing the issue in an interview on the KSM Show, said in spite of the incident, he still loves Joy FM. \n“Most times what people don’t understand is we are not that serious but then we check ourselves from time to time... because I love Joy [FM] and I will talk about Joy [FM] because I do love Joy [FM].” \nExplaining what necessitated the tweet, the Black Entertainment Television (BET) award winner said, “Just like you [KSM], I rarely will go on one show like back and forth; I come here because this feels like home, I think it’s more genuine and you bring the best out of people and that’s the best show you will like to come on. You will like to be able to express yourself well, be yourself and just have a positive energy.” \n“It’s rare you get that because when people need traffic, they need the controversies and they try to create the negative energy for people to watch because, believe it or not, people like bad news more than good news.” \nAccording to him while “the bad news is taking over” he sees Joy FM to be one that stands for the truth and does good news. \n“But then the people who choose to go with the good news if we have two of them, I feel like that’s all we have so anybody who is on that side... \n“I’m taking KSM as my number one when it comes to that and maybe one other person those are people I think I can go there and feel myself so if I lose KSM, you feel that thing within you.” \nSarkodie went on to explain that the tweet was personal and believes that the words he sent out were a bit disrespectful. \n“It’s nothing personal, it’s just maybe the words came out a bit disrespectful way but then I feel like this is something I love and I don’t want them to go on that way,” he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T05:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:54:17.289+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
