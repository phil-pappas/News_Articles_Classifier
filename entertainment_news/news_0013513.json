By Indo-Asian News Service on October 25, 2015 at 12:20 AM Comments \nHrithik Roshan said his upcoming show “Heroes” is not intended to compete with Aamir Khan’s “Satyamev Jayate” and Amitabh Bachchan’s “Aaj Ki Raat Hai Zindagi”. The show Hrithik will host is based on real stories about people who have come over their limitations and challenges and come out as heroes in real life. \n“‘Satyamev Jayate’ is a show about people, who are achievers in their own right and other problems, but ‘Heroes’ is real stories of people who overcome what they felt was their difficulty and obstacle. So it is about individual stories,” he said at the launch on friday to queries about similarities with the other two shows. \nDirector Samar Khan said: “So yes there is a certain amount of similarity and there is certain amount of difference in each show but I think it’s important for us to understand that everybody around now is celebrating these Heroes.” Reiterating it is not a competition, Hrithik said: “..the more the better. We need to spread more awareness about the positive.” \nWhile Hrithik was previously seen on the small screen as a judge for a dance reality show, with HRX Heroes he will make his debut as a host. The series will present real-life stories of men and women from across India, who did not give up on their dreams and emerged as heroes. The channel will kick start the series by featuring wrestler Sangram Singh, who was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis at a very young age. After fighting for several years, trying to overcome his illness, Singh became Commonwealth Heavyweight champion in 2015. \n  25, 2015 12:26 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T21:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:11:39.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
