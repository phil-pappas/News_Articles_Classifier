Something has to happen. We don't even get the same feeling anymore. And that's what's scary. The shock has worn off. Desensitization has settled in. Another day in the neighborhood and another mass shooting seizes another community. This time at a college in Roseburg, Oregon.\nShootings in Rochester have spiked this year.

We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones.\"\nEvery time we shrug our shoulders and chalk these mass shootings up to just a new normal, every time we let our politicians vote down another protection act or disallow them to tweak our current gun laws, we are saying that we just don't want to choose to become something different.\nUCC Roseburg, Oregon", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fdb4aa1ad7e3252650135c658a82c55a3c4859ab/c=0-19-150-131&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/02/Rochester/wp-ROC-Editorial-44480-2a6bb19c.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9e02b3769dc7b11d35a4df23b77db19827010508/r=150x150/local/-/media/2015/10/02/Rochester/wp-ROC-Editorial-44480-2a6bb19c.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/02/Rochester/wp-ROC-Editorial-44480-2a6bb19c.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-03T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:49:54.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
