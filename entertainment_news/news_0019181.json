VERTIGO (128 minutes) PG \nAlfred Hitchcock's masterful 1958 romantic thriller is a seductive yet clear-eyed study of the compulsions that rule lovers and moviegoers alike. The tricky plot lures us into identifying with an obsessive voyeur in the guise of a retired detective (James Stewart) hired to trail a mystery woman (Kim Novak) up and down the streets of San Francisco. Digitally projected. Rivoli, tomorrow, 4pm.\n2. HELLO, DOLLY! (148 minutes) G \nJohnny Depp as Whitey Bulger in Black Mass . Photo: Warner Bros \nGene Kelly's gargantuan 1969 adaptation of the Broadway hit about a fast-talking Jewish matchmaker (Barbra Streisand) represents the classic Hollywood musical in its late, decadent phase. The giddy excess of it all is hard to resist, and Streisand – in a role conceived for a much older performer – proves herself one of the most slippery and anomalous of stars. Digitally projected. Kino, tomorrow, 3pm.\nAdvertisement 3. JIM HENSON: COMMERCIALS AND EXPERIMENTS (73 minutes) Unrated 15+ \nJim Henson's real fans know that he was always much more than just a children's entertainer. This anthology of rare, innovative work ranges from TV commercials featuring early versions of the Muppets to the Oscar-nominated 1965 experimental short Time Piece , with Henson himself as an Everyman catapulted from one trying situation to another. Digitally projected. ACMI, today, 4.45pm.\nBarbra Streisand in Hello, Dolly! \n4. MIA MADRE (102 minutes) M \n​Nanni Moretti's latest genial comedy-drama follows his usual method of leaping from one tangent to another. The heroine is a high-strung left-wing filmmaker (Margherita Buy) who must tend to her dying mother (Guilia Lazzarini) while catering to the demands of an American star played by John Turturro at his most absurd. Screens as part of the Italian Film Festival. Palace Como today 4.15pm, Palace Westgarth today 9pm, and Palace Brighton Bay tomorrow, 4pm.\n5. BLACK MASS (122 minutes) MA \nScott Cooper's Boston true-crime saga borrows from Martin Scorsese classics such as Goodfellas , but feels more like horror than a conventional gangster film, with a typically strange performance by Johnny Depp as the psychopathic James \"Whitey\" Bulger. Joel Edgerton acts relatively human as an FBI agent who grew up with Bulger and unwisely makes a deal with the devil. (See review page 21.)
