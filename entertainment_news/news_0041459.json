Ms Mercy Agyapong, a government analyst at the Forensic Laboratory of the Ghana Police Service who tested the substance, Tuesday told an Accra Circuit Court that the substance proved positive for cannabis. The witness said having proven positive for cannabis, she wrote a report on the substance and submitted same to the “submitting agency”, insisting that the compressed substance weighed 127 grams. During cross-examination, Andrew Kudzo Vortia, the new lawyer for the accused, while serving notice to the court to recall an earlier witness in the case, asked Ms Agyapong whether she saw any other name apart from that of the accused on the envelope containing the substance. In response, the government analyst indicated that she was unable to recollect other names on the envelope. The trial judge, Aboagye Tandoh, adjourned hearing until Thursday, October 15, 2015 for the continuation of the cross-examination by Micah’s lawyer. The reggae musician has denied the charge of possessing narcotic drugs without lawful authority and is currently on remand.
