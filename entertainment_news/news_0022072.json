Barry, Special to The Day \nStonington — It’s natural to want to sneak a peek inside other people’s homes, especially when they’re historic or newer examples of fine architecture and design. \nSo get out your sneakers because Saturday is your chance to go inside seven diverse dwellings during “Behind Stonington’s Doors, a Walking Tour of Village Homes” to benefit the Stonington Historical Society. \nThis is the third year the Historical Society will host this event, which only happens every three years. No houses on the self-guided tour have been featured in previous tours, which says something about the extraordinary number of beautiful homes within the small scope of Stonington Borough. \n“This tour doesn’t only attract historians and old house people,” says Joyce Pandolfi, one of three event co-chairs. “It attracts those who are interested in how others have decorated their homes, and in picking up ideas about colors and furnishings and accessories.” \nThe tour sites range from a house built in the 1700s to a recently completed historic reproduction. Colonial Revival, Greek Revival, Georgian and Victorian “Italianate” are among the styles represented. \nHouse highlights \nSeveral of the houses have interesting histories regarding the people who inhabited them. \nA house locally referred to as “The Doctor’s House” that was built in 1840 is a good example of the Greek Revival style that was popular in the mid-19th century. \n“A lot of residents remember it being their doctor’s office, back in the ‘30s and ‘40s,” Pandolfi says. \nUnusual features include an off-center entrance, a double parlor with matching granite fireplaces, and a large open renovated kitchen hung with artwork painted by the owner, a local artist. A barn in the backyard that was converted into a working artist studio will be open to the public. \nAnother Greek Revival, built in 1833, is painted bright blue with a bright orange door. \n“The colors the owner uses inside and out are good examples of her love of bright, vibrant colors,” Pandolfi says. \nIn its early years, this home served as a boarding house for men who worked on the railroad that linked Boston to New York City through Stonington. Later, for unknown reasons, Pandolfi says it took a religious turn and became home to four clergymen who lived there at different times: two Baptist ministers, one Episcopal rector, and one Catholic priest. \n“It was even St. Mary’s Church social hall back in the 1930s,” she adds. \nThe oldest home on the tour is a grand Georgian style structure built in 1761. \nIt was among a number of homes in Stonington that were raised one level so shops and businesses could be put underneath. This house provided first-floor space for a succession of trades including a law office, cooper, tinsmith and general store. Now a private home, an outdoor staircase leads to the main house on the second and third floors. \n“There is wonderful art in this home by local artists, as well as one painting by Old Lyme's (19th-century American tonalist painter) Henry Ward Ranger,” Pandolfi points out. \nTwo houses on the tour are remarkable for their size and painstaking architectural details. An Italianate Victorian home built in the second half of the 19th century boasts elements that are typical of this style: tall height, octagonal cupola, low-pitched roof, asymmetrical floor plan and bay windows. Other special features include a newly renovated kitchen that takes advantage of harbor views, as well as antique decorative accessories, fine paintings and mirrors. \nAn imposing Colonial Revival home built in 1901 has a double front door that opens onto a large receiving hall. Of special note are 13 surviving stained glass windows in their original locations. The house is furnished with American, English and French antiques. \n“It’s such an interesting, wonderful home, we wanted to include it even though it’s a little further afield than the other houses,” Pandolfi says. “It’s very large — larger than most homes in the borough and has been painstakingly renovated (to include) a beautiful, large modern cook’s kitchen addition on the back of the house.” \nThe final two homes are a departure from previous years and add to the tour’s architectural diversity. \nOne home is actually new construction, but Pandolfi explains that the gambrel-roofed house, designed by a firm that specializes in historic reproductions, has traditional Colonial glazed 24-over-24 small pane glass windows and a weathered antique brick foundation. Yet, because of its proximity to the water it was built using today’s technology to withstand hurricane force winds and flooding. \n“It was built with a careful eye toward where it is, but it still looks like an old home,” she says. \nThe other home is the former coach house for the Atwood estate that was transformed into a residence. It remains traditional in style on the outside, but, Pandolfi notes, the inside has been opened up and has panoramic views of Little Narraganset Bay. \nWhere the money goes \nProceeds from the tour will be used for preservation of the Historical Society properties, including the Captain Nathaniel Palmer House, Woolworth Library and Old Lighthouse Museum. \nFunds raised also will benefit educational and community outreach programs. \n“A great and timely example of this is an elective course in Stonington history offered at Stonington High School,” says Elizabeth Wood, executive director of the Historical Society. “It provides guest speakers on a variety of Stonington history topics.” \nShe says that the class has grown to two sections of more than 20 students that visit Stonington Historical Society sites. \n“Nearly every third-grader in Stonington comes through our doors to visit these sites, as well,” she adds, “and we offer all Stonington students and school programs free admission.” \nThe Historical Society also provides a monthly series of lectures and programs free of charge to the public; pop-up exhibits at the Stonington Farmer's Market; and it is working on collaborations with the Pawcatuck Neighborhood Center, the Stonington Community Center, Stonington Garden Club and the La Grua Center. Built in 1901, this Colonial Revival home on the Stonington House Tour has a double front door that opens onto a large receiving hall.
