Photo: Paul Jeffers \n\nCumulus Inc\n45 FLINDERS LANE, CITY; 9650 1445\nMON-FRI 7AM-11PM; SAT-SUN 8AM-11PM  \nPeter Garrett is adamant he didn't sell out after he entered federal politics. The former Labor minister won't even concede that such allegations were inevitable after years spent advocating radical positions as the lead singer of the politically charged Midnight Oil.\nThe allegations came \"only from people who didn't think it through\", he says. \"And frankly, only from journos who wanted to run the line because it was such a simplistic line to run.\"\nTuna tartare with crushed green pea salad at Cumulus Inc. Photo: Paul Jeffers \nAnd no, he didn't join the ALP, as some thought, or even hoped, as a sort of environmental Trojan horse, working from the inside.\nAdvertisement \"No. No! It's very simple – people read so much into these things and the business of it is, it's like any other job. You go and do your job,\" he says.\n\"I knew people wouldn't like it, I knew I'd be called all manner of things … but that wasn't the point. It wasn't about me.\"\nHouse smoked trout, kipfler potato and mollet egg at Cumulus Inc. Photo: Paul Jeffers \nWe've met for lunch in between the dozens of speaking engagements Garrett has scheduled as he spruiks his memoir, Big Blue Sky .\nThe hefty and hotly anticipated memoir was not as explosive as many expected. Aside from his already much publicised description of former prime minister Kevin Rudd as a megalomaniac who was \"a threat to national security\", and Garrett's retraction about being offered cash by Clubs NSW in 2004, it's surprisingly controversy-free. (Regarding Clubs NSW, he says he \"mis-remembered\" while writing the book; it was actually a cheque made out to his electorate office. Publishers Allen & Unwin have had to include an insert with the retraction in every copy of the book.) \nMore than half his lyrically written memoir details Garrett's early life and foray into music and activism after his university years at ANU in Canberra. He says he'd pondered writing a memoir – no ghostwriter required – before entering politics.\nPeter Garrett describes his memoir, Big Blue Sky, as something of \"an ode to Sydney\". Photo: Paul Jeffers \n\"I thought I'd like to write about growing up and some of the things we did early on with the band. I'm a publicly spirited kind of person by default and … I've thought a lot about the places I've been and things I've done and figured here's a chance to try and get it down.\"\nGarrett, who lives in Sydney (he describes Big Blue Sky as something of \"an ode to Sydney\"), has chosen Cumulus for lunch. During the years, on and off, he spent here in his role of (youngest ever) president at the Australian Conservation Foundation, it was a favourite breakfast spot.\nHe's not, he says, a \"big eater during the day\", but this transpires to be something of a falsehood as our shared plates – Ortiz​ anchovies and toast, cured kingfish, smoked trout with kipfler potatoes and mollet​ egg, fresh asparagus and tuna tartare with smashed peas – arrive, and then leave, in quick succession.\nThe bill, please. \nHe went through a phase of vegetarianism but rescinded after getting sick while touring with the Oils. But he says he's not a big meat-eater.\n\"Although people who have been on the road with me might laugh if they heard me say that. I also like Japanese food. We realised we'd sort of made it in Midnight Oil when we graduated from hamburgers to sushi – that was a momentous day!\"\nHe professes a weakness, though, for a proper barbie; polling days were a breeze.\n\"A series of sausage sizzles altogether – my idea of heaven!\"\nHe's not much of a cook and is mystified by the current interest in food.\n\"I'm not someone who turns straight to the  [food] section and figures out where to eat tomorrow night,\" he says. He recalls the time a journalist asked him what his favourite meal was, and he replied that it was the rissoles and mashed potato his mum used to make.\n\"They asked  'how can a creative person like that kind of meal?' Well, actually if you'd tasted it, you'd know why – it's the associations that come with food. Like music, it's a total memory trigger.\"\nGarrett –  as physically imposing in person as you'd expect – is warm, engaging, but, like his memoir, circumspect with his answers; it's clear he's not going to add much to what he's already addressed in Big Blue Sky .\nHe bristles at the suggestion that the political chapters in the book have an almost apologetic air, listing in chronological order the issues on which he was accused by many of backflipping. \n\"I don't believe it's apologetic,\" he says. \"I think I had to explain things and if explaining sounds like that … Certainly, it's a good opportunity for people to read through and get a sense of it.\"\nAnd he says his stance, overall, hasn't changed; he describes himself in the memoir as \"an activist in a suit\".\n\"I never stopped being an activist, not for a second,\" he says. \"If you look at the environment portfolio and what we did, that was somebody who had an activist background. Maybe the superficial story doesn't tell that story – it's all slogan politics and grabs and bytes and social media – but if you have a serious look at it, and dive into the detail, that's what was happening.\"\nHe talks passionately about his political victories – although he doesn't refer to them as such, saying \"that's for other people to decide\" – like his successful campaign against \"scientific whaling\" in the Antarctic, the resale royalty scheme for visual artists and, in his second term as Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, the education reforms he helped secure.\nHe sets me straight on parliamentary entitlements (he doesn't receive a pension; doesn't believe they're too generous, and thinks it's a particularly \"Aussie thing\" to say politicians get paid too much), his thoughts on Kevin Rudd (\"I discovered what I thought of him as I wrote and reflected in the book\")  and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.\n\"He's gotta be better than Abbott,\" he says. \"It'd be impossible to be worse. I don't see much policy change yet, but it's early days. He's still in the long honeymoon.\"\nAbout more private matters, Garrett is, as he has always been, less forthcoming. I ask if any of his three daughters, aged between 25 and 30, look likely to follow him into either politics or music and he says \"that's a question you'd have to put to them\".\nHe doesn't feel his 62 years; he listens mostly to the music he grew up with – he loves the blues – and is liking \"a couple of Aussie hip-hop and rap artists, people like [Indigenous rapper] Briggs\". He gets out to the occasional gig; he just laughs when I ask if he's a thoughtful fan and stands at the back.\n\nAnd no, he says emphatically, he's not disillusioned with politics.\n\"Not at all,\" he says. \"But I'm not going back. I've done my bit, I've done 10 years – and how can you be disillusioned with serving people?\"\nA touch jaded then?\n\"I certainly don't feel jaded. And I can parry the jaded question in a thousand different ways but the short answer is no,\" he says. \"As I say in the book, I have no regrets.\"\nNow he's retired from politics (although remains a member of the ALP), he plans to spend more time involving himself in Indigenous affairs (\"my connection to places like the Western Desert has been a really rich thing in my life\") and environmental lobbying. But what does he actually do now?\n\"What I've always done – get out and about, follow my passions in my heart, work with people,\" he says.\nDoes he have an actual job? \"That's pretty rude,\" he laughs. \"I'm a writer-stroke-musician-stroke-activist and I'll continue to do those things.\"\nWhich is still kind of vague. \"I'm not trying to be vague –  I just don't have a lot of immediate plans other than to keep doing what I do. I'll do a little bit of [unpaid] work in the Western Desert with communities there.\"\nHe talks passionately about closing the Indigenous gap, about his ministry's implementation of Indigenous Ranger Cadetships, slamming John Pilger's 2013 documentary Utopia (\"It was wrong and overtly simplistic\") and citing Canada as an inspirational model of handling Indigenous issues (\"There's a great deal more participation by native Indian people in councils and governments\").\nHe's been approached with various job offers which he declines to name, but \"wants to stay in Australia\".\n\"I'm into being useful, and happy to not have to be at the front of things at all,\" he say. \"I'm not trying to be deliberately fuzzy, it's just open at the moment.\"\nAnd then, of course, there are the rumours of a Midnight Oil reformation. \"A surprising byproduct of getting to the end of a day of writing words to suddenly find music coming back was nice,\" he says.   Big Blue Sky ends with what appears to be a song – although Garrett says \"it's just some lyrics\" at this stage. \"Maybe…\"\nAny talk of the Oils reforming is just that, he says. \"They're rumours that are generated by us saying, 'We're not saying we won't'. It could happen – but it may not,\" he says. \"We did the bushfire fundraiser at the MCG, that was incredible but it was for the right reasons … Look, it could happen.\"\nBut whatever they do, should it happen at all, will be low-key, he says. \"I want to have a creative life that's satisfying but low-key.\"\nAre we talking a solo career? The next James Reyne​?\n\"Now you're just teasing me.\"\nBig Blue Sky, published by Allen & Unwin, is out now.
