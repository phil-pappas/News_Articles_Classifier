The folk singer and retired restaurateur wants to help elevate World War I to a more prominent place in our collective consciousness. He lauds the newfound attention to World War II and “The Greatest Generation.” Yet he shudders at the notion of The War to End All Wars seemingly plummeting into the dust bin of history. “In Europe, it’s a big deal,” says the English immigrant, a longtime Peoria resident. “ .. .It’s a pity World War I doesn’t have the place in (American) history that it really deserves.” Inspired by last year’s centenary of the outbreak of World War I, Cheesman has created an album, concert and program that breathe renewed life into the war and its era. Soon, he’ll take the program on the road, but not before hosting a local performance Nov. 9, in honor of Veterans Day. “People have had their eyes opened by the show,” says Cheesman, 69. “The show really hits hard.” As a younger man, Cheesman worked as a policeman in his native Godalming, about 40 miles outside London. In 1979, the budding folk singer took his guitar to America, where he eventually made his way to Peoria. He and wife April raised a family here before opening the English-themed Fox Pub and Cafe in Far North Peoria, in 2009. Though the eatery is now in the hands of one of their sons, the couple still frequents the place. There, in 2013, Cheesman and a pal were shooting the bull when they realized the 100th anniversary of the onset of World War I (July 28, 1914, to Nov. 11, 1918) was approaching. Cheesman felt a tug back to England. Cheesman — whose parents served in the Royal Air Force but did not much talk about their service — did not serve in the military. But he has harbored a deep respect for troops’ service and sacrifice, ever since his childhood. England, as well as the rest of Europe, is dotted with memorial after memorial from both world wars. Like many kids, Cheesman grew up marveling at the multitude of markers, which survive today. He says that’s one reason why World War I retains high recognition across the pond. “It’s not the same in America,” he says. “Then again, the war lasted only 18 months for America.” He pauses, then adds, “America saved our butts in World War I, just as it did in World War II.” In 2013, Cheesman wondered if he could help spark interest in World War I the best way he knows how: by song. Still, he can’t sing about things he doesn’t know. He recalled a few long-lost tunes from that era, like “It’s a Long Way to Tipperary” and “Pack Up our Troubles.” But he wanted to go deeper. So he launched a year-long research project, digging into the war from various angles. His readings touched on many curiosities of the war, the last fought with horses and without antibiotics. Indeed, World War I marked a horrific turning point in the science of war. “These young men had no idea what they were getting into: poison gas, planes, flame-throwers, tanks,” Cheesman says. “It was a brutal, brutal war.” In the end, he cobbled together a collection of songs written at various points over the past 100 years, with vantages ranging from the battlefield to homeland. Those songs comprise his CD “The Soul of a Soldier,” which includes the assistance of local musicians Bruce Burton and Shannan Sullivan. Further, leaning on his newfound insight, Cheesman crafted a two-hour program that weaves spoken word and song. It’s neither a lecture nor a concert — more like a two-hour portal back 100 years. “We have songs that have a bit of humor in them,” Cheesman says. “We have songs that are sad. It’s not a history lesson. I don’t want to hit people over the head with facts.” The journey was emotional for Cheesman, and continues to this day. He points to “The Gift of Years,” a song by Eric Bogle, which commemorates the Battle of Gallipoli, in Turkey. The ill-fated Allied operation, spearheaded by Winston Churchill, waged for nine months, a slaughter and stalemate that ended with 250,000 casualties on each side. The pointless human carnage weighs heavily on Cheesman’s mind. “I choke up introducing it,” he says quietly. Other stories and songs that grip Cheesman: “Geordie McCrae” : In 1914, the Hearts of Midlothian Scottish Football Club was enjoying an unbeaten season when the war broke out. As recounted by songwriter Robin Laing, 16 players gave up their privileged lives as pro athletes to enlist together under Sir George McCrae, a Scottish politician and hero. Most of the battalion, including seven teammates, died at the Battle of the Somme. Each year, their sacrifice is marked on Remembrance Sunday in Edinburgh, where services are attended by the current Hearts squad. “Letters from Wilfred” : This ballad by Alan Bell focuses on Wilfred Edward Owen, a language tutor in England who joined the fray in 1915. Between heavy action, including a gunshot to the head that sidelined him just briefly, he wrote 664 letters to his mother, including poems that graphically depicted the horror of trench and gas warfare. He died a week before the end of fighting, and news of his death reached his parents on Nov. 11, 1918 — Armistice Day. His verses, mostly published posthumously, earned him renown as the war’s greatest poet. “In Flanders Fields” : This simple poem (“In Flanders fields the poppies blow/Between the crosses, row on row”) succinctly captures both the courage and ache of war. The work was penned by Canadian physician Major John McCrae, who enlisted at age 41 and bypassed the medical corps to pick up a rifle. After burying a close friend killed during a battle in Belgium, he later noticed how quickly poppies grow at grave sites, inspiring the poem. On Cheesman’s album, McCrae’s verses are accompanied by a melody created by Cheesman. Cheesman has performed the program locally, but soon will hit the road, with stops outside Chicago and in Florida. But before he leaves town for a bit, he’ll perform a show Nov. 9 at the Fox Pub, with a portion of the proceeds going to help veterans. Cheesman invites people to come for a glimpse into a fascinating history that seems to get short shrift in school and our consciousness. “It’s sad this stuff isn’t taught much,” he says. “Some of these stories are gut-wrenching.” PHIL LUCIANO is a Journal Star columnist.
