Besides, in a new interview for the October issue of Allure magazine, Roberts opened up about how fortunate she was to be able to work together with her husband on the set of new movie \" Secret in Their Eyes \". Moder worked as the film's cinematographer. \"I don't know if I would have succeeded in some of the efforts that I made if he hadn't been in such close physical proximity to me,\" Roberts explained, suggesting that they didn't live \"separate lives.\" \"There's something about having the safest place in the world for you in the same room.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:35:04.178+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
