Allred and her law firm are representing Judy Huth in the lawsuit against Cosby.\nHuth is among 50 women who have accused Cosby of raping, molesting or abusing them during his years in the entertainment business. Cosby's attorney has denied the allegations.\nWhat was said in the deposition will remain under seal at least until Dec. 22, when U.S. Superior Court Judge Craig D. Karlan will review the testimony. The judge then will hear attorneys' arguments over what portions of the deposition will be made public.\n\"We will also be seeking to take a further deposition of Mr. Cosby at a later date,\" Allred said.\nHuth is due to be questioned in the case Oct. 15.\nHuth has said that she and a friend were in a park in San Marino, Calif., in 1974 when they wandered over to a movie set where Cosby was working.\nAccording to the lawsuit, he approached the teenagers, invited them to sit in his director's chair and asked how old they were. Cosby later invited the girls to his Los Angeles County tennis club the following Saturday.\nThey met him there, the suit said, and then followed him to a house, where he served them alcoholic beverages and played billiards with Huth, who was required to drink a beer every time Cosby won a game. Later, the girls followed Cosby to the Playboy Mansion, where he told Huth and her friend to say they were 19 if anyone asked their ages.\nAt one point, Huth used a bathroom and emerged to find Cosby sitting on a bed, the suit said. Cosby asked the girl to sit down on the bed beside him and attempted to \"put his hand down her pants.\"\nHe then took her hand in his and performed a sexual act on himself \"without her consent,\" the suit said.\nHuth's lawsuit, filed in December, is the first significant court case against Cosby since he was sued in 2005 by Andrea Constand, a Temple University employee. After being deposed in that case, Cosby settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.\nCosby's attorneys contend that Huth once tried to sell her story to the National Enquirer and that it is \"absolutely false.\" They also say another lawyer for Huth tried to get up to $250,000 from Cosby.\nAnother woman, Chloe Goins, sued Cosby in federal court this week, claiming he molested her in 2008 at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles. Her allegations were investigated by the Los Angeles Police Department and are being reviewed by prosecutors.\n(c)2015 Los Angeles Times\nVisit the Los Angeles Times at www.latimes.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1735837&h=Bill+Cosby+questioned+in+molestation+case", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1735837&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1735837"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T01:27:19.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
