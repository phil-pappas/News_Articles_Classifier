The 'Lately' hitmaker split from second wife Kai Millard Morris in 2009 after eight years of marriage, but their union has now been officially dissolved. According to TMZ, under the terms of their settlement, the 65-year-old singer - who filed for divorce in 2012 - has agreed to pay $25,000 a month in child support for their children Kailand, 14, and 10-year-old Mandla. The former couple will share joint custody of the boys and have agreed that Stevie can take them on the road when he tours on a limited basis. The blind singer used his thumbprint instead of a signature to sign off on the settlement. It was previously claimed Stevie - whose girlfriend Tomeeka Robyn Bracy gave birth to his ninth child, daughter Nia, last December - thinks he is a better father now he is older. The legendary crooner - who has children with five different women - is said to have told friends he hasn't always been available for his kids when they needed him, but as he has grown older, he has developed closer bonds with his brood, who range in age from one to 39 years old. A source said: \"Aisha [his oldest] enjoys her dad quite a bit, they get together and eat and joke.\"He's been helping [his son] Mumtaz with some of Mumtaz's music and he always talks about how talented his son is.\"He knows that being a father is a full-time job and now that he's a little older, he feels like he's up to the task and he doesn't want to let any of them down.\" celebrity", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:40:13.358+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
