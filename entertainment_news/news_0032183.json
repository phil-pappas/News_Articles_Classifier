It also prohibited the sale, trade or transfer of the whales. \nAnimal rights activists say the vote was a death blow to the use of killer whales at the California park. \nSeaWorld says the commission overstepped its authority and the decision has \"no legal basis.\" \nThe company says the federal government regulates the whales' care, not the commission.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:45:00.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
