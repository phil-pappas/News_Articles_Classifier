Still, Murphy declined an opportunity to perform a sketch about Cosby's fall from grace for Saturday Night Live 's 40th anniversary special.\n\"There’s nothing funny about it,” he told The Washington Post. “If you get up there and you crack jokes about him, you’re just hurting people. You’re hurting him. You’re hurting his accusers.”\nClearly, Murphy had a change of heart. But until we see the full routine when the broadcast of the Mark Twain prize ceremony airs on PBS on November 23, we won't know if Murphy addressed the assault allegations directly or just used the opportunity to do a spot-on Cosby impression. Either way, we're happy to see Murphy back on stage.", "external_links": ["http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/10/eddie-murphy-bill-cosby-standup/411277/"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:26:37.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
