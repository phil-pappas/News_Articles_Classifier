Related Stories Savannah candidates in place: Now the tough battle begins Chatham County State Court judges recuse themselves from Commissioner Yusuf Shabazz case READ: Chatham County commissioner cited with leaving scene of accident Editorial: County commissioner believes he's above the law Chatham County 'whistleblower' to run for Savannah City Council's 5th District seat Fired Chatham County \"whistleblower\" challenging termination By Eric Curl A candidate running for the fifth district of Savannah City Council says her opponent’s husband, Chatham County Commissioner Yusuf Shabazz, flashed a handgun at her after a debate Thursday night.\nShaundra McKeithen said Shabazz gave her a “menacing” look and pulled his jacket aside to show the gun at his side when she was getting ready to leave the Ralph Mark Gilbert Civil Rights Museum, where the forum for the fourth, fifth and sixth district candidates took place.\n“I really felt fearful,” McKeithen said.\nIn the report she filed (above) with Savannah-Chatham police that night, McKeithen said the gun looked larger than a .22 and had a black handle.\n“The complainant advised that she felt that he was trying to intimidate her even though he did not verbally say anything,” according to the report.\nAfter the incident, McKeithen said she had David Self, who is running for the District 6 seat, and some others walk her out to her car.\nSelf said he did not see Shabazz flash the gun but could tell she was concerned when McKeithen asked her to help.\nMessages left on Shabazz’s voicemail and given to his wife, Savannah Alderman Estella Shabazz, asking him to respond to McKeithen were not returned.\nThe alleged incident comes as Shabazz faces charges in Chatham County State Court of leaving the scene of an accident with injuries, reckless driving and driving on the wrong side of the road, all misdemeanors.\nPolice said Savannah employees were unloading a piece of heavy equipment from the back of a flatbed truck June 1 on Holland Drive and Holland Court when Shabazz drove up in what Savannah-Chatham police said was a non-emergency medical transportation vehicle.\nInstead of stopping, the commissioner went around an employee who was serving as a flag person, and a mirror on his vehicle struck her arm, causing minor injuries, according to police. Shabazz apparently kept going, but later returned. Workers told him they had called the police and that he needed to stay. He responded with: “Tell the police I’m Commissioner Shabazz” and left again, police said.\nChatham County’s three State Court judges have recused themselves from hearing the traffic charges against Shabazz, which means a judge will be selected from outside Chatham County. Under the state’s uniform rules of court, Liberty County State Court Judge Leon Braun will select the judge to hear the case.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/Shaundra", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/Shaundra", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/Estella", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/Estella", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/Shazam!_Crop.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/Shazam!_Crop.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-02T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T18:07:01.767+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
