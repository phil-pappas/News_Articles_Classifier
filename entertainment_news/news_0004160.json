Acting, she said, \"chose me.\"\nBlanchett starred in two films at the festival: Haynes' 1950s-set lesbian romance \"Carol\" and James Vanderbilt's \"Truth,\" in which she plays TV news producer Mary Mapes, who was fired over a story about former U.S. President George W. Bush's military service.\nAmerican director Robert Eggers' Pilgrim horror film \"The Witch\" won the festival's first-feature prize. Jennifer Peedom's Himalayan study \"Sherpa\" was named best documentary and \"An Old Dog's Diary\" by Shai Heredia and Shumona Goel took the short-film trophy.\nThe 59th annual London festival aimed to put strong women centre stage, opening with Sarah Gavron's political drama \"Suffragette\" and featuring 46 female-directed films among its 240 features.\nThe 12-day event brought a slew of awards-worthy female performances, including Blanchett and Rooney Mara as clandestine lovers in \"Carol,\" Brie Larson as a mother in an extreme situation in \"Room,\" and Maggie Smith as a redoubtable eccentric in \"The Lady in the Van.\"\nFounded in 1957 to show the best of the year's world cinema to a British audience, the London Film Festival has boosted its profile in recent years with bigger movies, more glittering stars and prizes to boost emerging awards-season contenders.\nIts prize-winners have a strong track record at the Oscars. The last two London winners, Andrey Zvyagintsev's \"Leviathan\" and Pawlikowski's \"Ida,\" faced off in this year's foreign-language Academy Award race. \"Ida\" won.\nThe festival wraps up Sunday with Danny Boyle's \"Steve Jobs,\" starring Michael Fassbender as the Apple founder.\nRelated Stories Feminist drama 'Suffragette' opens London Film Festival", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:26:54.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
