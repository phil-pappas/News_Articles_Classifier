Pixelmator 3.4 Twist introduces full support for OS X El Capitan, adds the new Split View feature, brings a new Photos Extension with Metal-based Distort tools, and more. Pixelmator 3.4 Twist is available today as a free upgrade from the Mac App Store.\n“Pixelmator always takes advantage of the latest Mac and OS X features and technologies, and today we’re thrilled to introduce Pixelmator 3.4 Twist with full support for new OS X El Capitan, the ability to work in Pixelmator and a second app without any distractions via Split View, and a new, Metal-based Pixelmator Photos Extension,” said Saulius Dailide, one of the founders of the Pixelmator Team. “Pixelmator Photos Extension features a collection of powerful distort tools, which allow users to distort images with stunning quality and incredible speed right inside the Photos app.”\nSplit View support lets you work with Pixelmator and any other app side-by-side in full screen. This means that users can edit their image and use the second app at the same time without any distractions.\nThe new Pixelmator Photos Extension brings powerful, Metal-based Distort tools to the Photos app. Now users can reshape areas of their images to retouch photos, create artistic effects, or simply have fun with their images without leaving Photos. Pixelmator Photos Extension is built from the ground up on Metal, Apple’s incredibly powerful and fast graphics-processing technology that allows users to distort images inside Photos with stunning quality and speed. Pixelmator Photos Extension features an instantly familiar user interface and feels right at home inside the Photos app.\nPixelmator 3.4 Twist features other improvements, including San Francisco as the new user-interface font, and enhanced support for the Force Touch trackpad, which makes painting with the trackpad even smoother.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13013885.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13013885.htm"], "published": "2015-10-15T13:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:12:33.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
