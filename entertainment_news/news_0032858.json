Doc Brown is back just in time for the 30-year anniversary of \"Back to the Future\" in a teaser trailer for the trilogy's Blu-Ray and DVD release in October. It's a 48-second clip from Universal Pictures Home Entertainment starring the DeLorean and Christopher Lloyd playing Doc Brown in his perpetual herky jerky state of amazement, all recorded on what looks to be 30-year-old video recording technology, which has a decent amount of battery life left. He only says, \"starting audio visual tracking\" in the clip, and maybe with a little more mumbly elocution than 30 years ago, but it was still good to see Doc alive and well. His white hair may no longer be a prop. But he's still got his lab coat, Hawaiian shirt and some nice new shoes. The release of the trilogy is set for Oct. 21, which is the date in the movies. The original \"Back to the Future\" came out July 3, 1985, making more than $200 million at the box office. In the film, Marty McFly, living in 1985 goes back in time 30 years to Oct. 21, 1955. In \"Back to the Future Part II,\" Marty travels 30 years into the future, to Oct. 21, 2015. So that's why the trilogy is going to be released on that date, which is a Wednesday -- not the usual release day for DVDs.
