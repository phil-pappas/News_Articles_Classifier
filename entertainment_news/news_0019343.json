FIAC as it was when she took over was \"humdrum,\" ''boring\" and \"insignificant,\" she says, adding that most of the major galleries had deserted it. For FIAC's 30th birthday in 2003, the front-cover of the prestigious art magazine \"Beaux Arts\" poignantly read \"FIAC: Birthday or Funeral?\" and the stakes were raised further when a rival arts fair, The Frieze, was launched the same year in London.\nIt was her grassroots knowledge of the gallery world and international contacts book that helped her rally support over the years. But more important, she says, was the fact that she was a foreigner.\n\"Not being French actually helped me as my Anglo-Saxon approach to things — more business-like, more pragmatic — got FIAC back on the map,\" Flay told The Associated Press .\n\"It helped me not only get round obstacles, but ignore some that I didn't even know existed,\" she added.\nFlay was awarded France's highest award, the Legion d'Honneur, and has never looked back to her pre-accident life as a gallerist.\n\"I had this near death experience: broke my neck, coma, head injuries,\" she said.\nFlay added that the life-changing experience had taught her \"about the meaning of working and being alive\" and that she wanted to try to give something back to society and to take risks.\nShe joins the long hall of fame of foreigners who have shaken things up in the City of Light. The founder of Paris' haute couture industry, Charles Frederick Worth was English. American Julia Childs popularized French cuisine. Paris-based artists Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso were Spanish. And France's most famous trend-setting queen, Marie-Antoinette, was Austrian.\n\"Paris is porous and is a place that's always welcomed and thrived with foreigners, even with the current debates about immigration,\" she said, referring to the migrant crisis which has seen hundreds of thousands of displaced spill into Europe because of crises such as Syria's civil war.\nOne of FIAC's greatest strengths is that is acts as a barometer to the world around it.\nOn Wednesday one artist, Rashid Johnson recreated a Berlin-type wall in front of the fair's main venue, the Grand Palais. The mortar between the bricks is Shea butter — a metaphor ridiculing the childishness of prejudice.\nAsking to sum up the FIAC in a few words, Flay displays her trademark mix of confidence and self-deprecation, that has served her well in the snooty Paris salons.\n\"Exciting, and powerful,\" she hesitates, before laughing. \"Was that pretentious? Let's say a work in progress.\"\nFIAC runs from Oct. 22-25.\n___\nThomas Adamson can be followed at Twitter.com/ThomasAdamsonAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T16:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:42:18.895+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
