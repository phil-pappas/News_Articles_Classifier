Plus, it has a heady smokiness from Spanish smoked paprika. The flavor combination matches the taste experience that bacon typically provides in such recipes, but in a much more healthful way.\nOne key to the dressing is to use sun-dried tomatoes that are dry, rather than oil-packed. They are rehydrated in hot water, and you use that soaking liquid, which takes on a deep tomato-y flavor, in the dressing as well, along with extra-virgin olive oil and a splash of sherry vinegar.\nThose ingredients meet in a skillet where the mushrooms have been thoroughly browned and tossed with garlic and the paprika.\nOnce the dressing is warmed through, it is poured over a mix of baby spinach leaves and thinly sliced red onion, then tossed so the greens and onions surrender a bit.\nThe result is a big-flavored salad that's hearty enough for an evening meal.\nâ€¢ Ellie Krieger's most recent cookbook is \"Weeknight Wonders: Delicious Healthy Dinners in 30 Minutes or Less\" (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2013).
