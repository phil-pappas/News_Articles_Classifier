He's between albums at the moment so he's spending a lot of time building things in my house. \n''We bought a wardrobe this week which took ages to put together! It's really cool, I needed it because I'm running out of space. He built it and I was doing more of the clearing away, getting rid of the packaging and then organising everything else that was going in the wardrobe so it was a team effort, I think! \n''We also went to Ikea the other night and we spent two hours there and came away with one scrubbing brush. Going to Ikea is more about going for the meatballs, isn't it? Who doesn't enjoy Ikea meatballs! He had never been to Ikea before so it was great; it was the best day ever. I drive a little Fiat 500 so I was never going to fit anything in it anyway.'' \nWhen asked if he minds doing so much DIY for her, Ella said with a smile: ''He's got to be OK with it! Well, he's still around so he must be.'' \nAlthough Lewi spends a lot time at Ella's London apartment, he is yet to officially move in and that suits the 21-year-old pop beauty because she loves staying at his home in Manchester. \nShe said: ''It may as well be the two of us living there, but he still lives in Manchester and I love it in Manchester so I'm always back and forth.'' \nAlthough Ella and Lewi have to miss out on time together because of their busy careers she has devised a plan to use their jobs so they can hang out with one another. \nShe said: ''I drag him to events, it's just nice to spend any time that we can together really.'' \nElla is up for Best Female at the 20th MOBO Awards which take place on Wednesday November 4 at Leeds' First Direct Arena.
