At AMC Loews Boston Common, Regal Fenway Stadium and suburban theaters. Grade: D First, “Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension,” the sixth and supposedly final installment in the “Paranormal Activity” series (yes, please!), is only occasionally in 3-D. If you paid the 3-D price to see it, you’ve been snookered.\nI kept those horrible 3-D glasses off most of the time and wore them only when necessary, which was not often. This installment is set in December 2013, two years after the previous film, and the family about to get its Christmas-season paranormal activity on is the 30-something Fleeges: video freak Ryan (Chris J. Murray), attractive wife Emily (Brit Shaw), tween daughter Leila (Ivy George), Ryan’s brother Mike (Dan Gill) and Emily’s sexy sister Skyler (Olivia Taylor Dudley).\nThe Fleege family has just moved into a lavish rented home that was a deal almost too good to be true (redrum). But when Ryan finds a box full of old VHS tapes (ruh-roh) and an old, but custom-made video camera capable of seeing what the naked eye cannot he starts filming with it, and Leila starts talking to an imaginary friend she calls Tobi. On the tapes are images of two girls, cult members, who used to live in a home on that site, a house that burned down. One of them seems able to gaze through the screen and see Ryan watching her (They’re heeee-eere).\nThe film’s screenplay, attributed to five people, is derivative, idiotic and full of behavior so ridiculously stupid, you cannot possibly believe any of it, especially the part about someone filming all the action. At one point, Mike tries to explain a strange noise to Skyler by saying, “It’s just the wind,” which got a laugh at least. In scenes lifted from “The Exorcist,” a Catholic priest dabs holy water on Leila, while she gazes at him like he’s a Big Mac in a collar. But increasingly these “found footage” “Paranormal Activity” films, which got their start with Oren Peli’s truly frightening 2009 minimalist gem “Paranormal Activity,” are not for people seeking credibility. They are for people who enjoy films in which things leap in front of the camera and make them jump in their seats and grab one another. First-time director Gregory Plotkin, who favors tilted Dutch angles, gives it to them over and over again, and the trick never gets old with them. To paraphrase Ryan and Mike: What the heck, dudes?\n(“Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension” contains profanity, frights and grotesque stupidity.)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?text=%E2%80%98Ghost+Dimension%E2%80%99+worse+than+%E2%80%98Paranormal%E2%80%99"], "published": "2015-10-24T23:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:33:10.524+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
