Andrew Cuomo again railed against Congress for not passing stronger gun laws after 10 people were killed and another seven were injured Thursday after a 26-year-old gunman opened fire in a classroom at a community college in Oregon. The shooting at Umpqua Community College is the \"latest in a series of terrible, heartbreaking tragedies resulting from gun violence,\" Cuomo said.\nThe Democratic governor has become more stern in his call for stronger national gun laws in recent months , particularly after one of his aides, Carey Gabay, was killed by a stray bullet last month in Brooklyn.\n\"The prevalence of gun violence in this country is a sickness that continues to claim innocent lives and threaten our communities seemingly at random on a daily basis,\" Cuomo's statement Thursday said. \"We have seen too many of these pointless, brutal tragedies, and the sad truth is that, in spite of it all, Washington has done nothing.\"\nIn 2013, in the wake of the school shootings in Newtown, Conn., Cuomo got the state Legislature to pass a series of gun-control laws, called the SAFE Act . The measures, which include stronger background checks and mental-health reporting requirements, has been derided by gun-rights activists and lost Cuomo some electoral support, particularly among upstate voters last year when he won re-election.\n\"We passed the smartest gun control legislation in the nation in this state and yes, it was hard, and yes, it cost me political capital, but it's probably one of the proudest things I've ever done because that law saves lives,\" Cuomo said Friday on NY1.\nCuomo has taken his ire out on Congress recently, saying it has failed to pass gun-control laws as the number of mass shootings continue to rise.\nHe said that as part of the presidential debate and the fight in Congress over a potential government shutdown, gun control should be a top issue.\n\"I mean you have a congressional discussion where they want to shut down the government if the Republicans don't get a tax cut for the rich, I would love to see the Democrats stand up and say, \"We are going to shut down the government or threaten to shut down the government if we don't get real gun control legislation,'\" Cuomo said.\nPresident Obama offered a similar critique of Congress last night.\n\"Each time this happens I am going to say that we can actually do something about it, but we're going to have to change our laws,\" the Democratic president said in an address. \"And this is not something I can do by myself. I've got to have a Congress and I've got to have state legislatures and governors who are willing to work with me on this.\"\nThe state Rifle & Pistol Association has panned New York's law, saying it hasn't made the state safer -- pointing to a spike in shooting this year across the state. The group has said that the problem is illegal guns, but Cuomo has countered that a national gun policy would help eliminate illegal drugs being shipped across state lines.\nRochester \"Mayor Lovely Warren championed Cuomo's gun law. With the results showing the whole thing blowing up in her face, is Mayor Warren going to call for it's repeal?\" Tom King, president of the group, said in a statement in August.\nJSPECTOR@Gannett.com\nwww.twitter.com/gannettalbany", "external_links": ["https://soundcloud.com/nygovcuomo/governor-cuomo-calls-into-ny1-on-october-2-2015", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/10/01/officials-active-shooter-oregon-college/73153610/", "http://www.lohud.com/story/news/politics/albany-watch/2015/09/08/cuomo-calls-national-gun-policy/71879220/", "http://www.lohud.com/story/news/politics/albany-watch/2015/06/26/change-new-york-safe-act-gun-groups-disappointed/29332913/", "https://www.nysrpa.org/pressreleases/"], "published": "2015-10-03T04:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:10:58.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
