Francis Maguire reports.   \nWe're just weeks away from the release of the latest Bond film \"Spectre\" But it sounds like it might just be the last time we see Daniel Craig playing the British spy. In a recent interview with Timeout Magazine a reporter asked Craig if he could imagine doing another Bond film. The British star replied, \"I'd rather break this glass and slash my wrists. No, not at the moment. Not at all.\" Craig added he's ready to \"move on\" and that he'd only do another Bond film \"for the money\". So, if that's the case it seems James Bond isn't forever for Craig and \"Spectre\" could be the actor's goodbye to the franchise. The Sam Mendes directed movie is released in the UK on October 26th.  //reut.rs/1Mgm4vk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:29:11.614+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
