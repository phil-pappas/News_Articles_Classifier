I was away shooting Britain and Ireland’s Next Top Model , so I couldn’t see my doctor and I was really panicking,” the Australian beauty told Mail Online. \n“It was four weeks before I got the biopsy results, so it was a long-drawn-out and stressful period of not knowing. \n“I was lucky — it was a fibroadenoma [a benign growth of fibrous tissue], but it was a really big warning. I did some soul searching and realised that maybe I was taking the wrong vitamins and minerals, not eating properly and was too stressed.” 'The Body' \nMacpherson, who is married to American billionaire Jeffrey Soffer, said she was burning the candle at both ends and only getting up to four hours sleep a night. \n“I’d put the boys to bed at 9 or 10pm and work until 2am because that was the only quiet time,” she said. \n“Then I’d get up at 6am. I did that for years. I thought I was incredibly productive; I didn’t realise I was burning out my adrenals and hurting myself just from not getting enough sleep.” \nAs she approached 50, Macpherson said she realised she needed to maintain her body “from the inside.” Loved up ... supermodel Elle Macpherson with billionaire Jeffrey Soffer.
