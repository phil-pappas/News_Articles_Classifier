They seemingly pushed through the crowd to make their exit. The security at the strip club was clearly unhappy with their action. The security then pushed them back.\nTheir scuffle ended up in the street where Kevin's car was waiting for him. A lot of people rushed around his car. Some of them took time to film the incident.\nThe 36-year-old actor apparently did not like a fan filming the incident. He could be seen in the video grabbing the cell phone and throwing it away.\nAt the end of the video, there was a lady approaching Hart's car.\nApparently, she was a waitress who got stiffed by the actor. He reportedly had not paid the USD 65 bill. The annoyed waitress knocked his car's window but there was no response.\nThe car left the scene instead and the waitress walked back without receiving the money.\nMeanwhile, the strip club manager said Hart is a good guy. Of what Kevin did at the club, the manager said it was just misunderstanding and the actor would cover the bill.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:07:36.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
