To date, four soundtracks have been awarded this honor, a win by Forever Strong! would be the first time the honor would be bestowed upon a complete symphonic movement.\nForever Strong! tells the story of the USS Indianapolis, a flagship of the United States Navy's WWII battles across the Central Pacific, which was torpedoed by the Imperial Japanese Navy, on July 30, 1945, sinking in 12 minutes, never to return to San Francisco's Golden Gate; her last view of American soil before embarking upon that final mission. The photos of lost crewman Alfred Joseph Sedivi, the ship's photographer whose works survived because he secretly sent them home to his family, dynamically bring to life the crew of the ship they affectionately called \"the Indy Maru\" along with treasured pictures donated by veterans, and an original painting created by artist Irene Krauss in Forever Strong!.\nForever Strong! musically sculpts a moving tribute to the brave crew, both survivors and the 880 heroes who lost their life on that fateful voyage, as vivid swells and crescendos of Melillo's music wash over the listener. \"In Heaven and in our hearts,\" says Melillo, \"the ship and her crew will always be coming home to loving, waiting arms. With that message and in that purpose, this work is lovingly offered.\"\nThe premiere screening of Forever Strong! took place at the official USS Indianapolis Survivors 70th Reunion on July 26, 2015.
