Bruce Rauner planted a \"for sale\" sign Tuesday on the James R. Thompson Center, angling to get a good price for taxpayers on the prime downtown real estate. His administration hopes to sell the building within the year and move government offices elsewhere.\nWatching Rauner make the announcement felt a little like watching a used car salesman try to sell a lemon. (\"Just imagine this beauty with a new coat of paint! It could be yours for a mere $99! Sign right here ...\")\nBuilt in 1985, the Thompson Center represented a new era of open office space. Walls and doors and ceilings? Who needs those? The 17-story building was designed by Helmut Jahn atrium-style and renamed in 1993 to honor the former four-term governor.\nThe Chicago Architecture Foundation describes the building this way: \"When you first encounter the Thompson Center, you might wonder if a UFO has landed in the middle of the Loop. The Helmut Jahn-designed center of state government is unabashedly Postmodern, with colorful details and a shape that references the dome of the state's capitol. In addition to making a bold first impression, its design is intended to communicate a message. The openness and transparency of the building are meant to symbolize the state's commitment to serving the people.\"\nThe building has symbolized the \"openness and transparency\" of a state in which two of the last four governors have gone to prison. But we digress.\nThe building has outlived its usefulness. It is inefficient and out of place. Rauner predicted that whoever buys the building would likely demolish it rather than try to make use of its, um, unique design.\nWait. We know exactly who should buy it: George Lucas.\nWhy build a weird homage to \"Stars Wars\" on the lakefront when we already have a weird homage to \"Star Wars\" in the Loop? This is the perfect home for the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art.\nThompson Center for sale Scott Stantis Scott Stantis \"This is one of the most valuable, nicest blocks in the entire state, let alone the city of Chicago,\" Rauner said.\nHear that, George?\nHard to figure what it's worth. In 2003, then-Gov. Rod Blagojevich thought he could collect $200 million in a sale/lease-back of the Thompson Center, but that idea never got launched.\nA sale of the Thompson Center to Lucas at almost any price would be better for taxpayers than the deal being pushed by Mayor Rahm Emanuel: The Chicago Park District will hand lakefront property to the Lucas museum on a 99-year lease for $10.\nYes, the all-glass structure is expensive to heat and cool. More than $100 million would need to be spent fixing it up. And there are other problems. State workers who report to the Thompson Center are subjected to a myriad of scents from restaurants on the lower level. (Nobody should be subjected to onions and burritos at 9 a.m.) The building is noisy from shoppers and visitors, which makes it harder for employees to get their business done.\nRauner looking to sell Thompson Center Gov.
