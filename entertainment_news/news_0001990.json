On any given weekend night, you'll find a line of people waiting to order snaking through the surrounding tables. But this isn't just average bar food.\nHotbox, the plop-down restaurant behind Parkside Café, dispenses Asian-inspired small plates from a permanently installed, converted Airstream. Since opening in May 2014, Hotbox has enjoyed a symbiotic relationship with Parkside, a former antique store across from Avondale Park whose current owner reopened it as a bar on New Year's Eve 2010.\nThe independent businesses are linked by a recently built, multi-level patio/courtyard decorated with leftover antiques. On warm evenings people fill the patio tables, ordering drinks from the bar and plates from the silver Airstream.\nEdward Stacey, Hotbox's owner and a former manager at La Paz restaurant in Crestline, talked with Parkside owner Michael Dykes for more than a year about adding hot-food service at the Avondale bar.\n\"Finally we decided we either need to do it or stop talking about it,\" he says. \"I bought the trailer from a dude in Florida and brought it up here.\"\nThe inspiration to use an Airstream for Hotbox came from food trailers in Seaside, a Florida-panhandle resort town.\n\"That's where I got the idea,\" says Stacey, who also works for a seafood distributor. \"I was doing business along (Florida Highway) 30A and had seen Airstreams used for food service.\"\nSince opening with two Bottega-trained chefs (one has since departed), Hotbox's bar food has been anything but typical. Bacon jam adds savor to the namesake burger. A chicken sandwich comes dressed with the spicy pickled cabbage, kimchi, and extra-rich Japanese mayonnaise.\nBeer and drinks from Parkside take on an entirely new dimension when enjoyed with ginger-spiked beef lo mein, fried chicken seasoned with lemongrass and coconut, or hand-made pot-sticker dumplings.\n\"We try to keep it diverse,\" says Ryan Champion, a partner and head chef. \"It's easier to please a wide variety of people when you have a wide variety of food.\"\nThe menu changes weekly. But the Hotbox Burger, Lemongrass Fried Chicken, and variations on both pot stickers and the Drunken Noodle bowl are constants due to popular demand.\nChampion likes cooking food from Asia and Latin America, but has experience in a variety of cuisines.\n\"I was at Commander's Palace for a long time,\" he says. \"I did the Michelin-star French fine-dining. I've done Italian – a little bit of all of it.\"\nBut the chef was looking for a change when the Hotbox opportunity came along after a gig in Las Vegas.\n\"I have done fine-dining most of my life,\" Champion says. \"I wanted to cook that level of food for a quarter of the price and serve it to people from the neighborhood without all the pretension that comes along with fine-dining in a big restaurant.\"\nThe meat at Hotbox comes from many of the same sources as those served in the city's top restaurants. But instead of filet mignon and foie gras, Hotbox uses more proletarian cuts like thighs and brisket. All dishes sell for less than $15.\nIt took a little while for Hotbox to get off the ground, though. Officials needed months to sort out how to regulate and permit a kitchen that was neither a food truck nor a brick-and-mortar restaurant. Parkside had been a pioneer in the fast-growing Avondale entertainment district, but word got out slowly about the Hotbox Airstream hidden out back.\n\"We didn't have money to advertise,\" Stacey says. \"But Parkside has a lot of regulars. It started with word of mouth, and then we got some good press. We've seen the clientele change a little bit from mostly local people to more over-the-mountain people coming in to check us out.\"\nAs Hotbox enters its second winter in business, the owners will break out space heaters and light the fire pit on the patio. Look for soups and other warming dishes like ramen. To-go orders, delivery inside Parkside, and an expanding catering operation should help carry the business until warmer weather.\nBecause it is part of a bar, Hotbox is adult-only; no one under 21 allowed. But it still draws plenty of parents and their offspring. \"We see a lot of regulars bringing their parents in to eat,\" Champion says.\nHotbox has established a niche among the diverse array of restaurants, bars, music venues, and the craft brewery that have opened over the last five years along and adjacent to 41st Street South in Avondale.\n\"There is a certain nostalgia involved with the Airstream trailer,\" Stacey says. \"But a lot of people that dine here for the first time are really surprised by the quality of the food that comes out. It's just a different experience.\"\nHotbox is behind Parkside Café\n4036 Fifth Ave. South (Avondale)\nOpen Tue. - Thur., 5 p.m. – 11 p.m.,\nFri.-Sat., 5 p.m. - 1 a.m.\nhotboxbhm.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:43:36.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
