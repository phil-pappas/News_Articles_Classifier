Something he says he made British intelligence services aware of.\nI didn't expect to be in prison accused of waging war against India, I mean, me personally waging war against India...I looked it up in the law books and looked at the particular charge. This had a death sentence attached to it. It was quite a shock!\n– Peter Bleach Surviving in an Indian jail took all of Bleach's cunning and resourcefulness. Firstly he grew a moustache, a key status symbol in gaining the respect of the men he was imprisoned alongside. Then, he set about using his ability to read and write to help fellow prisoners draft their letters of appeal against their sentences.\nPeter Bleach in 2004 as he arrived home in the UK following his imprisonment in India Credit: Press Association After eight years of incarceration, much of which spent in solitary confinement, a surprise intervention from Russian President, Vladimir Putin, meant Bleach was released with a pardon to come home to Scarborough and an attempt at a return to normality.\nIt's strange how your brain protects you, I was back in my mother's village and the next day I hopped into the car to head to town to get a few things and it was as if I'd been in the UK all along and the Indian experience was like a distant memory.\n– Peter Bleach Now, nearly ten years after his release, he is able to look back at his story through the big screen. Niels Holck is wanted for extradition to India for his part in the arms drop, so the story is still very much in the public consciousness there. Bleach, however, holds no ill-feeling towards Holck, and has even testified in Danish court about the conditions in prison to help Holck avoid extradition.\nNiels Holck (played by Andreas Führer) in 'The Arms Drop' Credit: Fridthjof Film I have mixed feelings these days about Niels. I don't want him to go to Indian prison, it wouldn't achieve anything. But I do believe as a Danish citizen he should stand trial in his home country.\n– Peter Bleach The film centres around Bleach's narration of events leading up to his imprisonment, which was filmed on several occasions over a period of years. This meant that Bleach had to dig out the same outfit he was wearing each time, have his hair exactly the same, and reset his home exactly the same too.\nBleach during his incarceration in India Credit: ITV News Along with Bleach's narration, the film features re-enactments of events in 1995 using actors. Bleach was played by fellow Yorkshireman, Paul McEwan, who spent several days capturing the former arms dealer's mannerisms and accent.\nThe resulting film, Bleach feels, is an accurate portrayal of events, and one that tells his story in a way he thinks captures the complexities of the events leading to his being jailed, \"like stepping back in time\". The attention to detail even extended to finding the sister aircraft of the plane Bleach was in during the drop in 1995, and crewed by those who knew the original crew.\nPeter Bleach being interviewed in 'The Arms Drop' Credit: Fridthjof Film The filming process also helped Bleach to get in touch with people who knew snippets of information about the drop, and piece together his own story.\nWith the film released in the UK this week, Bleach says he's happy with his quieter life these days, although he is still fighting to get his conviction for waging war against India overturned.\nI believe you've got to move on in your life, and I very much have moved on. If you want an AK-47 these days, you certainly won't get it from me!\n– Peter Bleach Last updated Wed 7 Oct 2015 Entertainment Peter Bleach Scarborough", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T23:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:06:53.613+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
