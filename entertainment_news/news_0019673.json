(AP) - Police say a Pennsylvania woman has eaten some of the heroin she bought while working as an undercover informant for investigators.\nThe Altoona Mirror ( http://bit.ly/1iR4bf4 ) reports that 33-year-old Pamela Laich was working with Altoona police Sunday night when she bought heroin from the target of the investigation.\nPolice say Laich was instructed to buy five bags for $80 but after a long delay came back with only three. The undercover officer supervising Laich made her go back for two more bags, but police thought what she returned with looked odd. Police say they later determined she had switched the heroin out with dry baby cereal.\nPolice say Laich then sneaked the heroin into a holding cell, where she ate it.\nCourt records don't list an attorney for her.\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1iR4bf4"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T02:50:38.315+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
