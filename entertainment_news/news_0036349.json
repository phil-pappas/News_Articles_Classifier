The first time we worked together was in a commercial. So it wasn’t in a movie or TV show. We were working as commercial models,” Dawn shared.\nDawn Zulueta and Richard Gomez\n“We go around the same circles. We have the same friends even up to now. Parang ang feeling ko… dun pa lang, ’yung ganu’ng klaseng history, malalim na ’yun, eh,” she added.\nThe bond between the two has transcended a romantic relationship that fell on the sideways.\n“I’m just very grateful that even inspire of hurt, ’yung pinagdaanan namin before… medyo ininda ko ’yun ng mga dalawang taon, eh. Going back, kahit na nagkaroon (kami) ng ganoong episode sa buhay, pasalamat na lang na we were able to shift back to being friends again,” she said.\nRichard echoed the sentiment. “Hindi nga maiiwasan nu’ng maghiwalay kami ni Dawn – dahil nga we go around the same circle – nagkikita-kita pa rin kami,” he noted, pointing out, “Comfortable kami sa isa’t isa. Up to this day we have remained friends.”\nAWKWARD MOMENT\nDawn recalled feeling jittery when they both found themselves working together years after their split.\n“I felt awkward kasi after naming (maghiwalay), I got married, he got married. (Then) we did ‘Filipinas’ (where) we played brother and sister… Ang weird,” she said.\nRichard cut in, “Tama lang ’yun.”\n“Oo nga, tama lang ’yun pero ang awkward,” Dawn instantly replied.\nYears after their separation, the former couple was asked if they harbor any regrets.\n“I think naman hindi mawawala ‘yun,” Dawn admitted. The fact that they have remained friends means to her that “siguro naman kahit papaano there’s something na I still like (in him).”\nWhile many ex-lovers don’t readily forgive each other or have come to not like one another, neither is true with them.\n“I like him as a person. There are things pa rin naman that we still share up to now like our sense of humor, para kaming mga bata, mapaglaro. Those qualities we enjoyed prior to having a relationship, during the relationship, and even now, we still enjoy that,” she explained.\n“I agree,” Richard said. “The nice thing about me and Dawn (is) we’re the type of ex-couple na good friends na we can talk about a lot of things. Minsan we talk about other people; we talk about ourselves. Nag-level up na ’yung relationship namin (into) a more mature stage of friendship.”\nSPOUSES SAY…\nAs Richard and Dawn are being paired anew on ABS-CBN’s “You’re My Home,” they were queried about the reactions of their spouses, who both happen to be members of the House of Representatives – both Congresswoman Lucy Torres-Gomez and Congressman Anton Lagdameo.\n“Si Lucy kasi, she’s always been a fan of Richard and Dawn. She loves watching our movies… seeing (us) in a teleserye. Ganu’n si Lucy sa amin. Siguro pati na rin ang fans namin. Although alam nila na may kanya-kanyang kaming pamilya, the fantasy sa kanila lives on,” Richard said.\nDawn, meanwhile, said Anton is really a movie fan. “He’s able to differentiate kasi (between) what my onscreen persona is and what I am at home.” She stated her husband appreciates what they do onscreen on a level that “(it’s) a kind of fantasy, (a) pairing that is special to me and Richard.”\nShe added, “Hindi naman siya naba-bother sa ganu’n because he knows that he and I have our own also. Secure siya sa fact na iba naman kami. First of all, I married him… so, relaxed siya doon. Ang tingin niya (sa pairing namin), it’s a product, which is appreciated by a lot of people. And he also appreciates it.”", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T11:26:46.796+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
