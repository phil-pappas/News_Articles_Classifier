The German and Swedish ambassadors also attended, as did Mia Couto, a prominent Mozambican author. \nCouto says Mankell had \"one foot in the snow and one foot in the sun,\" a reference to how he divided time between Sweden and Mozambique. \nMankell died Oct. 5 in Sweden after a battle with cancer.
