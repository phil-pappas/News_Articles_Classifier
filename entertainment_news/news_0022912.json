It proves to be an ultra-sensitive device to elucidate specific molecular processes and pathways and reveal the nature of cell heterogenecity. Hospitals, academic institutions, government bodies, as well as pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms are increasing their focus on application of cell analysis as a modern emerging tool in research, drug discovery and diagnosis. The cell analysis techniques global market is segmented into molecular approaches, image-based approaches and others. The molecular approaches include the PCR, NGS and Microfluidics, cell isolation & separation techniques performed at cells genomic level, where as the image-based approaches include microscopes, FISH, FRAP, tracking, high content screening (HCS), cytometry techniques etc. The cell analysis products market is mainly segmented into consumables and instruments. \n\nThe consumables include reagents, assay plates and microplates where as the instrument segment comprises of microscopes, flow cytometers, --**spectrophotometer, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR), microfluidic devices, cell counters, high content screening (HCS) systems and cell microarrays.\n\nBy application, the market is segmented into by processes, by feild and by therapeutics. By processes is segmented into Cellular processes, Signal transduction pathways, Circulating tumor cells, Single cell analysis, Epigentic target analysis, Subpopulation Characterization, Drug and candidate screening. By field is further segmented into forensic Science, therapeutics, cell imaging, biomarker research, genomic analysis, stem cell analysis, and diagnostics. By therapeutics is further segmented into cancer research, infectious disease diagnosis, genetic testing, immunology, others.\n\nBy end-users, the market is segmented into Hospitals, Academic and Research Institutes, Contract Research Organizations (CROs), Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology Companies, Cell Banks, Diagnostic Laboratories and others. \n\nBy geography, the market is segmented into North America , Europe , Asia Pacific and Rest of World. North America holds the largest market share, followed by Europe and Asia . The APAC regions tend to be an emerging market with an opportunity for growth and are likely to be a destination of investment for new investors in the cell analysis market. Drug discovery services outsourcing and government funding for novel screening technologies has resulted in growth of Asian markets.\n\nThe cell analysis market is expected to grow at a rate of 9.6% during the forecast period. The major factor influencing the growth is enhanced precision of cell imaging and analysis systems which in turn reduce time and cost of drug discovery process. In addition, the factors like increasing incidence of cancer, increasing government investments, funds and grants, availability of reagents and cell analysis instruments are driving the growth of the market. However, the major market restraints include high capital investments and shortage of skilled labour for high content screening procedure. The biggest opportunities for this market is the emerging APAC market, high content screening services provided by contract research organizations, automation in cancer research for its early diagnosis and reduction of cost in the cancer treatment. \n\nThe global cell analysis market is a competitive market and all the active players in this market are involved in innovating new and advanced products to maintain their market shares. The key players in the global cell analysis market include Agilent Technologies, Inc. (U.S.), Becton Dickinson and Company (U.S.), Bio-Rad Laboratories (U.S.), Danaher Corporation (U.S.), GE Healthcare (U.K.), Merck KGAA ( Germany ), Olympus Corporation ( Japan ), PerkinElmer, Inc. (U.S.), Promega Corporation (U.S.), Qiagen N.V. ( Netherlands ), Sigma-Aldrich Corporation (U.S.) and Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. (U.S.). In order to offer the products with better software, most of the players in the cell analysis market are collaborating with companies and educational institutions.\nDownload the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/2840412/ \n\nAbout Reportbuyer\nReportbuyer is a leading industry intelligence solution that provides all market research reports from top publishers\nhttp://www.reportbuyer.com \n\nFor more information: \nSarah Smith \nResearch Advisor at Reportbuyer.com \nEmail: query@reportbuyer.com  \nTel: +44 208 816 85 48 \nWebsite: www.reportbuyer.com \nSOURCE ReportBuyer\n\n\nRELATED LINKS\nhttp://www.reportbuyer.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T23:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:07:05.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
