The actress and comic has more than 2 million Twitter followers, and nearly as many on Facebook and Instagram. \nHer cousin, Sen. Charles Schumer, knows that. \nOn Sunday, they stood in front of New York's City Hall for what they call their \"crusade on guns.\" \nIt started in August, when the two teamed up days after a gunman fatally shot two women in a Louisiana theater showing \"Trainwreck,\" starring Amy Schumer. \n\"On Thursday, July 23rd, a man sat down for my movie, \"Trainwreck.\" I don't know why he picked my movie,\" she said on Sunday. \"It is something I live with every day.\" \n\"Schumer & Schumer\" — as the cousins whimsically dub themselves — urged lawmakers to back a proposed gun control bill sponsored by the New York Democrat. \nIt would close the loophole allowing weapons to be sold without background checks at gun shows and online; fill gaps in the background check system itself; and stop arms trafficking of weapons across state lines. \nIn New York City, 85 percent of guns used in crimes come from out of state, the senator said. \nThe two Schumers want Americans to call, write, tweet, post on Facebook and march to stop gun violence. They say that could create a groundswell forcing a vote early next year. \nOn Sunday, Amy Schumer introduced the hashtag #AimingForChange to give people a voice across social media. \n\"Live from New York: We're aiming for a change,\" the senator added, playing on words that kick off television's \"Saturday Night Live,\" recently hosted by Amy Schumer. \nThe senator believes at least 40 other senators support him, but he hopes for votes from the 60 needed to pass a bill. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:05:51.384+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
