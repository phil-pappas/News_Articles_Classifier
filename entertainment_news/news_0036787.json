The election on October 18 will determine who holds the coveted positions in the South Indian Film Artistes' Association (SIFAA), popularly known as Nadigar Sangam. Meanwhile, Sarathkumar's team held a press meet a couple of days ago and Radikaa Sarath Kumar had lashed out at Vishal trying to break the unity of the actors. In her speech, Radikaa repeatedly chose to address actor Vishal by stressing on his family name 'Reddy'.\nCondemning Radikaa's tactics of trying to bring in caste and religion, Vadivelu asked, \"Why did Radikaa Sarath Kumar call Vishal as 'Vishal Reddy' again and again? What is the necessity? Is there a language for actors? Isn't it wrong? What is reason for her to keep repeating that. She was sitting next to Urvashi. Isnt' she a Malayalee?\"\nFurther lashing out, he quizzed, \"Because Vishal is against your team, you are calling him Vishal Reddy. Will you call Rajinikanth as Sivaji Rao, if he contests against your team? Will you try and bring in caste and religion against whoever is against you?\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:16:02.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
