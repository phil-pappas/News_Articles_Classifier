The lovey dovey duo walked their first carpet together Sunday, October 4 at The New York Film Festival premiere of his movie \" Bridge of Spies \" at Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center in New York City. Dobrev looked chic and sleek in a black Versace dress with red side panel that showed off her long and slim legs. She completed her look with Charlotte Olympia clutch, H. Stern jewels, and Casadei black stilettos with a silver ankle strap. She, moreover, wore her pretty brunette hair down in soft waves. Stowell, meanwhile, looked dapper in grey shirt, black pants, tie, and suit. Dobrev and Stowell walked the red carpet hand in hand and at one point even shared laugh as they posed for the awaiting photographers. Dobrev, 26, and Stowell, 30, were first linked in June, when they got cozy during a comedy show in Hollywood. They jetted off to Saint-Tropez for a PDA-filled vacation the following month. Back in August, the two were photographed packing on amorous PDA in New York. Stowell, moreover, was Dobrev's date at her former \" The Vampire Diaries \" co-star Kayla Ewell 's September wedding . \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:32:54.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
