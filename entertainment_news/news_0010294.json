With the lights down there is sparkle and spectacle. But when the music fades and the lights come up, the worn stage is exposed, a crumbling framework around the sequins, feathers and pots of greasepaint used to craft the mirage.\nTo the audience's eyes, a large-scale stage production like the Disney musical  Aladdin , staged on the grand stage of New York's New Amsterdam Theatre, is a whirling dervish of colour, movement and sound. In truth, what is happening backstage is infinitely more complex.\nAladdin (Adam Jacobs) and Jasmine (Courtney Reed) come together through love, luck and a little bit of magic.

In a sense, the audience only sees the tip of the iceberg and that, Disney's maestro of musical theatre Thomas Schumacher says, is an illusion as old as theatre itself.\nAdvertisement \"This is where [the musical]  Funny Girl was staged, where [performer] Fanny Brice did her thing,\" Schumacher says, sitting in the dress circle of the New Amsterdam and gesturing down to the now empty stage. \"There were as many as 125 ladies in those shows, plus the specialty acts, dogs, ponies. They disappeared elephants in this theatre. Where did it all go?\"\nIn  Aladdin , mercifully, there are no real elephants, though the complexity of the backstage operation is nonetheless breathtaking. \"This show, particularly, is designed to have that feeling,\" Schumacher adds. \"The creative tension of the show is very contemporary, but at the same time, classic, old-fashioned stuff, and I think that's what makes you feel good about it – it's the familiar.\"\nJames Monroe Iglehart won a Tony for Best Featured Actor in a Musical for his role as the Genie in Aladdin.

It was first compiled in Arabic, though it is widely accepted the tale of Aladdin was not added to the collection until the 18th century, under the editorship of Antoine Galland.\nDisney turned it into a spectacular (and lucrative) animated film in 1992, telling the story of a poor street urchin, Aladdin, who falls in love with Jasmine, the daughter of the Sultan of Agrabah​. Their love is thwarted by the ambitious machinations of Jafar, the Sultan's Grand Vizier, who has designs on the throne. Things are ultimately put right with a bit of luck, a lot of love and the enchanted touch of Aladdin's friend, the Genie, released from the wondrous lamp.\nThat tale is essentially retained for the stage musical, which premiered in 2011, featuring music by the iconic Disney songwriter Alan Menken​ and lyrics by Howard Ashman and, later, Tim Rice and Chad Beguelin. The stage musical features the songs from the film, several songs written for the film which did not make the final cut, and new material written only for the musical.\nAladdin is a whirling dervish of colour, movement and sound.

The first conversation, Schumacher says, is in some respects the most practical: booking the venue. Then come questions about the spectacle itself – can the stages in Australia replace the complex system of lifts and rigging used on Broadway?  Aladdin , perhaps more than most musicals, involves a lot of mechanics, he says. \"You subtly shift things. It's a living organism.\"\nNot everything will go to plan, of course, though Schumacher is unfazed by the challenges. He recalls a conversation he had with the tennis champion Billie Jean King at a party. She had caught him preoccupied with production issues for another show he was working on. \"Suddenly alone with Billie Jean King, I explained I had a fairly hard thing going on. She said, 'Well, you know Tom, champions adjust, champions adjust'. That's some of the best advice I've ever gotten.\"\nIt freed Schumacher up mentally to focus on the maintenance of what he considers the most important thing in theatre: the show and its relationship with the audience.\nThe stage show closely follows the plot of Disney's 1992 film.

The job isn't just to make a show and walk away, it's not like a movie. You nurse this baby, but it can fall off its bike, it can crash, it can get sick.\"\nAt the heart of the staging of  Aladdin  is the magic carpet, a spectacular effect that allows Aladdin and Jasmin to fly across the stage. How the carpet actually functions is unclear, and despite the question, Schumacher isn't saying a word. It does seem commercially sensible to imagine it is a case of the Broadway stage protecting its trade secrets, but Schumacher says the reason for his silence is far simpler.\n\"I'm a big believer in hide-in-plain-sight, and I'm a big believer in no secrets,\" he says. \"I'm not going to tell you how the carpet's done, not because it's some big, giant trade secret, but because it wouldn't be fun for you.\"\nAdam Jacobs as Broadway's Aladdin.

It doesn't work like that,\" he says, laughing. \"It's fun for you to play with it, but it's not any big piece of rocket science, it's just fun. I don't want to create something where it's someone's job to poke holes in it. It's an illusion, but I don't explain it because that takes the fun out of it.\"\nIndeed, the show employs a raft of vanishing tricks and optical illusions, though they seem based more on sleight of hand than high-tech effects. In that sense,  Aladdin  is a modern Broadway musical with a tangible nod back at old-fashioned theatrical magic. \"Every trick in the show is old-fashioned magic, every one of them, including the flying carpet ... old-fashioned magic, as opposed to some real high-tech thing,\" Schumacher says.\n\"There are a couple of reasons for it, including that if we did really complex illusions the whole show would have to be designed around that,\" he says. \"There are certain things like smoke and mirrors that are key to magic, vanishing illusions, things like that, that have been around for a long time, back in the 19th century and earlier. We just want it to be fun.\"\nAlan Menken composed some of Disney's most iconic musical soundtracks, including The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin.

The thing here is the humanity of this piece, the fundamental humanity is a simple story that actually resonates. We're not doing A Moon for the Misbegotten .\"\nDespite its simplicity, Schumacher says the show's emotional impact is profound. \"I find it very moving at the end when Aladdin gives the genie his freedom. I love that moment,\" he says. \"I like that the dad loves his daughter. I like that they like each other, and I think that the audience takes great pleasure in seeing that.\n\"We all live in the same world,\" Schumacher says. \"As the emcee says in Cabaret , leave your troubles outside. Here life is beautiful. The girls are beautiful, even the orchestra's beautiful. That's  Aladdin .\"\nAladdin opens at the Capitol Theatre in August 2016. \n\nTHE MUSIC MAN \nAs a young boy, the acclaimed composer Alan Menken would sit at his piano and go \"where the music went\". His family would watch and though he says he was never certain whether they weretruly transported with him, \"that was my earliest experience of creating a musical journey and having people go on that journey with me\".\nAround the same time he saw the Disney film Fantasia , which comprised eight animated sequences set to a soundtrack of classical music. Originally released in 1940, it has endured in popular culture, notably for an appearance by Mickey Mouse in one of the sequences, The Sorcerer's Apprentice .\n\"A young boy who loved classical music, seeing and hearing, experiencing the combination of music and visuals together in the most incredible way,\" Menken recalls. \"I never heard music the same way again. I began to attach sort of imaginary visuals to every piece of music. That probably affected how I felt about music and how I felt about writing music in a very intrinsic way.\"\nThe impact has been profound. In addition to Little Shop of Horrors , Menken has composed some of Disney's most iconic musical soundtracks, including The Little Mermaid , Beauty and the Beast ,  Aladdin , Pocahontas , Hercules and Tangled . For Menken, though each score exists as a finished piece of work, they are never wholly completed.\n\"It's incredibly organic,\" he says. \"Each moment of the show has a string attached with an endless number of thoughts, memories, emotions that are personal to me. So the soundtrack is an end-product or a snapshot of a moment, truly a snapshot for me. But it's nice to have a finished form, very, very nice.\"\nIn bringing  Aladdin  to the stage, Menken felt there was an opportunity to reinstate several songs he had co-written with the production's original collaborator, Howard Ashman, who died in 1991. \"It's unthinkable to do a stage musical of  Aladdin  and not bring in the songs that he and I wrote that couldn't make it in. And as it is, we didn't get all of those in,\" he says.\nThough each composition, and each suite, is unique, the question of what defines a Disney musical is a complex one. Menken is not sure where the parameters sit. \"There is a Disney ethos that exists on a subjective level, [but] I don't know objectively how to describe what is uniquely Disney as opposed to musical theatre, or as opposed to MGM or as opposed to another kind of film or musical,\" he says.\n\"Has anybody interviewed Disney and asked about what is Alan Menken music?\" he asks. \"The truth is, I don't even know where one starts and the other starts or stops. Disney music is Disney music. Alan Menken music is Alan Menken music. I know the influence goes in both directions. I've influenced a lot of what Disney music is now and they've influenced a lot of what I am.\"\nAs a composer, Menken is aware of the way sound can manipulate the emotions. \"And they're not ripping your heart out in an isolated way,\" he says. \"You have to have a sense of what your tools are too. You're painting with music. It's a vocabulary.\"\n\nOne question he cannot answer is which of  Aladdin's tracks is most beloved. \"It's pretty impossible,\" he says. \"There's Arabian Nights , with a camel coming over the dunes and that sense of the mysterious East. There's Friend Like Me , which is the jazz and the ebullient homage to Harlem jazz. There's A Whole New World , which is the sense of flight and pop wonder.\n\"They're all equally important to the blend, it's like creating a stew,\" Menken says. \"What's your favourite, the garlic, the beef or the tomato? It's a stew.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T11:20:01.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
