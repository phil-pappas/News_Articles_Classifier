The global residential diesel portable market to grow at a CAGR of 8.2% over the period 2014-2019. \nThe report includes the present scenario and the growth prospects of the global residential diesel portable market for the period 2015-2019. The market can be segmented into three divisions on the basis of product range: <3 KW, 3 to 10 KW, and 10 to 15 KW portable generators. The report includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market. \nNext-generation generators are expected to play a vital role in complying with eco-friendly regulations, as they have built-in electronic governors and automatic voltage regulators. These technologies automatically control the speed of generator engines as needed, thereby making the generators more energy efficient. Also, smart generators possess additional features that enable them to be monitored remotely via the Internet. Therefore, the emergence of next-generation generators is a trend in the market and is expected to have a positive influence on market growth. \nAccording to the report, residential and commercial end-users were the two major end-users in the global portable diesel generator market in 2013. Portable generators offer more benefits compared to large and stationary generators, especially for residential consumers. Portable generators emit less noise and require low initial investment and minimum maintenance. These generators are user-friendly and portable, and users do not require special technical knowledge to operate them. In addition, these generators are relatively safe and fitted with circuit breaker protection to prevent overloads. Most portable generator models are being introduced with inverter technology, which is used to generate clean energy. The energy generated by these devices is safe for the operation of electronic devices. \nFurther, the report states that many large end-users have begun to adopt gas generators instead of investing in diesel generators due to their limitations. \nKey vendors \nBriggs & Stratton Cummins Generac Holdings Honda Motor Kohler Other prominent vendors \nCaterpillar Eaton GE Honeywell International Perkins Pramac Key Topics Covered: \nPart 01: Executive summary \nPart 02: Scope of the report \nPart 03: Market research methodology \nPart 04: Introduction \nPart 05: Market landscape \nPart 06: Market segmentation by product range \nPart 07: Geographical segmentation \nPart 08: Market drivers \nPart 09: Impact of drivers \nPart 10: Market challenges \nPart 11: Impact of drivers and challenges \nPart 12: Market trends \nPart 13: Vendor landscape \nPart 14: Key vendor analysis \nPart 15: Other reports in this series \nPart 16: Appendix \nFor more information visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/kxt353/global  \nMedia Contact: Laura Wood , +353-1-481-1716, press@researchandmarkets.net \n \n\nSOURCE Research and Markets\n\n\nRELATED LINKS\nhttp://www.researchandmarkets.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T14:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:25:26.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
