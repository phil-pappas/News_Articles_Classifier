But with the Mets now two games away from the World Series — and with Cubs ace Jake Arrieta thrown way off his game on Sunday night — I'm settling in for at least another week of October baseball. \nAnd what better way to cheer the home team to victory than alongside hundreds of other fans at one of New Jersey's sports bars? \nOf course, just about every bar and restaurant these days has a television, and you can expect them all to be tuned to Games 3 and 4, on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. \nBut not all sports bars are created equal. \nRELATED: Neighborhood hangout in South Jersey named N.J.'s best bar \nEarlier this year, I went on an epic search to determine N.J.'s best bar , considering everything from upscale wine bars to downmarket dives, and everything in between. And while no sports bars made my list of the ten best bars in the state , there were five standouts in the category — all great spots to drink a beer and watch the Mets (or any other team, for that matter). \nHere they are, along with one bar that did make the finals, which — although not a sports bar — will have some resonance for Mets fans. THE BEST \nJack's Goal Line Stand , 149 Brighton Ave., Long Branch, (732) 870-8800. \nMy selection for the state's best sports bar may come from way out in left field, but no bar does the sports viewing/food experience better than Jack's, in a building that once housed a hostel and a steakhouse. The current owners transformed what one staffer called a \"dingy little college dive bar'' into an open, comfortable space several years ago. There are 50-plus TVs and an impressive craft beer selection, with more than 50 brews on tap. They do wings like nobody's business; about 10,000 were cooked for Super Bowl Sunday. The menu covers all the sports bar food bases and then some. One must-try: the baby-back ribs. BEST OF THE REST \nBig Apple Sports Palace , 414 Broadway, Bayonne, (201) 858-1075 \nLively combination of sports bar and neighborhood hangout, with a cast of characters worthy of a reality show and in a city that once boasted 200-plus bars. Owner Vinny Bottino is an engaging, down-to-earth owner. He is proud of the four \"monster'' satellite dishes on the roof and likes to point out the autographed shirts and jerseys on the wall, including one signed by James Gandolfini (an episode of \"The Sopranos'' was filmed in Bayonne). There are more than 40 TV screens, two dining rooms and — don't forget — the outdoor tiki bar in the summer. The pizza is thin crust and good. \"This is my home away from home,'' says regular Danny Delbridge. \"I go home, come back here, go home. Maybe ShopRite in there somewhere.'' A old Wheel of Fortune pinball game sits in the corner lit up and waiting for be played at Big Apple Sports Palace. Bayonne, NJ 2/13/15 (Saed Hindash | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com) Saed Hindash \nFireside Grill and Bar , 133 Main St., Marlboro, (732) 780-7900 \nPart of the new, showier generation of sports bars, the Fireside boasts seating for 300, several bars, an outdoor patio, a smoker for barbecue and tons of sports memorabilia; the entrance is a re-creation of Yankee Stadium's facade. Monday is craft beer Monday; $3.50 craft beer pints all day. I'm not a huge fan of Cobb or Caesar salads, but Fireside's Chop Chop Cobb, with romaine, tomato, red onion, avocado, bacon, roasted turkey, hard-boiled egg, cheddar jack cheese and a tasty lemon vinaigrette dressing, is first-rate and served in a cylindrical tower you almost don't want to disturb. Good barbecue, too; of all the rib sauces, the mango jalapeño sauce was my favorite. \nMiami Mike's Sports Zone , 130 Route 10, East Hanover, (973) 887-1300 \nProbably the state's best-known sports bar, Miami Mike's is owned by Dolphins fan Mike Minervini, who greets customers with a throaty \"Game On!'' There's nothing subtle about his menu; wings, Philly fries, the 2-foot-long Stadium Dog (\"biggest hot dog in any sports bar'') and the Godzilla wrap (skirt steak, salsa, sour cream, guacamole, shredded cheese, rice and beans rolled into three overlapping tortillas) are among the cholesterol-raising menu items. There are 50 TVs — you'll even find them in the rest rooms — and loads of sports memorabilia. Recommended: the nachos with chicken and the chili. Thai chile calamari served up at Plank Road Inn. Seacaucus, NJ 2/25/15 (Saed Hindash | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com) Saed Hindash \nPlank Road Inn , 1538 Paterson Plank Road, Secaucus, (201) 865-9516 \nWhat was Chris Rock doing standing on a table at the Plank Road Inn in 1985? Stand-up, what else? The comedian performed for $30 and taxi fare back to New York City; his photo is on the wall of this bar, minutes from the Meadowlands. It's been around since 1910, when it was known as Mosey's, after owner Charles Mosey. Jeff Rennie is now the bartender; his father and uncle are the owners. \"I've been hanging out here 30 years,'' Kevin Lord says. The house shot is the Shooter McGavin, after the character in \"Happy Gilmore,'' a summer-smooth concoction of Jameson, sweet tea vodka, peach schnapps and lemonade. The Frankenstein wings — so named because they combine three sauces — are excellent, and so is the Thai calamari. BONUS PICK \nMurphy's Tavern , 17 Ward Ln, Rumson, (732) 842-1600 \nOK, so this isn't a sports bar — it's a former speakeasy , located in the basement of a neighborhood home, with a lively jukebox and old-school cocktails. But with Daniel Murphy hitting home runs like crazy, I figure anything named Murphy is worth patronizing during the playoffs. As I wrote earlier this year: \nThe food, made in a tiny, cramped kitchen, is good. We had a truffle white pizza last night and in our first visit sampled the pork roll fries, one of the best foods sampled in my three weeks of visits. The jukebox rocks — Johnny Cash to Neil Young to 50s hits. The Ward Lane bar opened in the midst of Prohibition, and quickly became a familiar haunt to rumrunners and smugglers navigating the nearby Navesink River. \nAt what sports bars will you be watching the game?
