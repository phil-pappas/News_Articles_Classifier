It is not something which is specific to one culture. It is something universal to human beings,\" he said.\n(Reporting by Kirsti Knolle and Harro ten Wolde; Editing by Mark Trevelyan )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:26:31.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
