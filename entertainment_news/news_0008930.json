Close your eyes and let the sounds take you back to Greenwich Village during the 1950s and 60s.\nThe folks behind the “Folk City: New York & The Folk Music Festival” have put together a celebration of the city sounds that brought audiences and artists together in the neighborhood with wonderful street names like Bleecker and MacDougal. From now through next January 10th, at the Museum of the City of New York on Fifth Avenue and 103rd Street, you can rediscover —or discover— the kind of music that captivated a generation of beat loving, guitar strumming folk fans.\nThe exhibit showcases a number of the former Robert Zimmerman aka Bob Dylan ’s hand written penciled lyrics and posters. A copy of the Western Union telegram from talent agent/manager Harold Leventhal to Theodore Bikel happily reports that their friend Pete Seeger is now a “free man” following the U.S. Appeals Court dismissal of his indictment. Harold Leventhal was instrumental in bringing Bob Dylan to that non-Village arena known as Carnegie Hall. A $3 ticket to that Dylan concert back in 1963 is on display, as is a $2.75 ticket to Dylan’s Town Hall concert from the same year.\nUptown’s Carnegie and Town Halls notwithstanding, it was the narrow streets around Greenwich Village’s Washington Square Park that became known for hosting the true folk music scene. The exhibit reinforces that fact with maps, original signage, black and white videos, photos and lots of memories. The exhibition takes note of the well-known Cafe Feenjan at 117 MacDougal Street. It was an Israeli-owned folk cafe that featured Yiddish folk music along with Israeli, Greek, Turkish, and Armenian sounds. Talk about music uniting the nations!\nDownstairs at 152 Bleecker Street was Cafe au Go Go, Harold Solomon’s basement nightclub. Folk music was king here, as was comedy, especially after the performances, obscenity charges, and finally the arrest of comedian Lenny Bruce, who by the way, was born Leonard Schneider in nearby Mineola.\nSpeaking of Long Island—and Port Washington to be specific—the Folk City exhibition also features an original album and story of singer-songwriter Jean Ritchie, who performed with many folk music legends including Pete Seeger. She was also well-known for her involvement with the popular Newport Folk Festival. I remember visiting her home down the block from the Port Washington Library after she had left the town to move back to Kentucky. She unfortunately died this past June at age 92. Can’t you just imagine the kind of concerts she and Pete Seeger (who passed away last year at age 94) are giving now up in Heaven?\nAs you’ll realize after you leave this wonderful Museum of the City of New York exhibition, the folk music scene has basically left the small stages and basements of Greenwich Village. But if you’re a folk music fan like me and you still crave live performances, here’s good news. The Port Washington Library has a Sound Swap series. Add to that Port’s Landmark on Main Street Fabulous Folk series, plus Garden City’s Our Times Coffeehouse and Garden Stage Coffee House, also in Garden City. They are just some of the local area venues that are helping to keep live folk music front and center…and strumming along.\nThat's all folks!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:54:11.112+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
