Dan Debuf and Maz Compton failed to get off the starting block in ratings since beginning the slot in January. Their predecessors, Mel B, Sophie Monk, Merrick Watts and Jules Lund, who started in January 2014, also underwhelmed, facing a tough ride in following Kyle and Jackie O who decamped to KIIS at the end of 2013.  \nMcManus has worked regularly in radio, beginning as a guest host with Triple J in 1999 and with other stints on Triple M. \nThe position would put him back in rivalry with Kiis FM's Kyle Sandilands and Jackie Henderson. Sandilands once labellled Rove a \"piece of sh-- cable host\".\nSpectrum", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T12:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T15:53:37.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
