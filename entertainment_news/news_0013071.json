(AP) — Atlantic City taxpayers have been left on the hook for about $65,000 in security costs from this year's Miss America pageant parade.\nThe city was forced to cover the tab after organizers said they couldn't pay, The Press of Atlantic City reported (http://bit.ly/1jekvY0).\nThe Miss America Organization says the Boardwalk parade is like other major events that rely on public agencies for security and that it wasn't privy to costs.\nAtlantic City is usually responsible for paying for the parade's police detail and subsequent cleanup of the Boardwalk.\nThe newspaper obtained cost-related emails through an open records request.\nRecords show the Miss America Organization ran an $882,278 deficit in 2013, the year the pageant returned to Atlantic City from Las Vegas.\nThe organization now says it's on firm financial footing.\nState officials helped lure the pageant by promising a $7.3 million subsidy package through the end of this year.\nTalks of a contract extension for the pageant are clouded by a proposed five-bill package designed to stabilize Atlantic City's finances.\nPlans calls for allocating roughly $25 million to $30 million in annual Casino Reinvestment Development Authority funding to the city to help pay off municipal debts. Part of the authority's funding helps bankroll the pageant.\nJosh Randle, chief operating officer for the Miss America Organization, couldn't provide an estimate of how much the pageant costs the public.\n___\nInformation from: The Press of Atlantic City (N.J.), http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com\nSociety & Culture Atlantic City Miss America pageant", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:56:38.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
