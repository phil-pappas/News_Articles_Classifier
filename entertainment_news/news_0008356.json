Neverland is where adventure awaits and child play never grows old. However, the primal beginnings of Neverland are explained in the new 2015 film “Pan.” “Pan” is set during World War II in England. The film opens with a woman, running through the streets with a baby in her arms. She leaves the baby on the steps of an orphanage — the child later turns out to be the famous and mischievous Peter Pan. The movie flashes forward to Peter as a young boy. One night, he’s abducted from his bed by pirates and taken aboard a flying ship. After escaping the real world, the ship is transported to the infamous Neverland. The difference is that this Neverland is not the same at the colorful, Disney version. This Neverland is a mining area full of orphans from all around the world. It is at the mine that Peter encounters Blackbeard, the pirate who is in charge of Neverland, played by Hugh Jackman. Peter learns that the orphans are taken as slaves, mining for an element produced by fairies called pixum, which is used to stop aging and growing. There, Peter makes friends, discovers new abilities and fights for his life and the lives of the other young boys with him. What really impressed me with this movie was all the foreshadowing to the future events that we all understand to be true in the Disney version of “Peter Pan.” A few examples include when Tiger Lily, Pan, and Hook are in mermaid lagoon and Hook asks why pirates don’t dare come to mermaid lagoon. Tiger Lily responds by saying that pirates are afraid of the mermaids and the crocodiles. As soon as Hook hears her say the word “crocodile,” he jumps back, showing his fear for the predatory animal. Another example of foreshadowing is toward the end of the movie. Hook and Pan are having a friendly discussion of who is in charge of the island and Pan says, “Don’t worry. We’ll have plenty of time to argue over that.” Since I have always been a huge fan of “Peter Pan,” even now, I absolutely fell in love with this movie. We all know the story of the boy who never grows up, who has found no limit to childhood. However, we never know the origins of the story. This movie gave a lot of insight as to how the enchanting tale all began. It shows Neverlands humble and grim beginnings to the reign of Hook and Pan. If you are a Peter Pan fan like myself or if you are a lover of Disney, this is the movie for you. It has truly changed the perspective I held on Neverland. Page 2 of 2 - Many efforts were taken to secure Neverland’s youthful reputation. I love how this movie gave me a new outlook on my favorite story. If you believe in faith, trust and pixie dust, you should definitely escape to Neverland and see Panin theaters. — Kate Ross is a senior at Sacred Heart-Griffin High School. ***", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T09:15:07.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
