The \" The Pursuit of Happyness \" actor revealed the tour plans during a new interview on Beats 1 Radio. \"Jeff and I actually have never done a full tour,\" the 47-year-old entertainer said in the interview. \"I was always on 'The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air', or making a movie. So I'm looking this summer to be the first time we go out on a full world tour.\" Asked about recording new songs, Smith said, \"I'm pretty much poppin' in the studio everyday and I'm looking for artists to collaborate with.\" He then added, \"I've probably recorded 30 songs. I have six or seven that I really, really like.\" During the interview, Smith also admitted to be feeling \"terrified\" to get back into the world of music after such a long hiatus.
