(Supplied photo) Article Report an error \n\\If anyone was born to dance it's Calgary's own Ryan McCaffrey. \nHe's been dancing for 29 of his 32 years and, by the time he was 10, McCaffrey had made his mark as one the finest Irish dancers in North America and five years later he received world-wide acclaim. \nWhen he was 16, McCaffrey was in England for a dance competition when something happened that changed his life forever. \n\"They were holding auditions for a dance show called Dancing on Dangerous Ground. \n\"My parents said I could audition just for the experience but they were taken aback when I was offered a job,\" says McCaffrey. \nAfter much discussion his parents allowed him to take the offer and, not surprisingly, McCaffrey was the youngest member of the company. \nHis stint in Dancing on Dangerous Ground led to a role in Riverdance on Broadway and in the Riverdance international touring productions. \n\"When I was 19, I came back to Calgary to finish my high school at Bishop Carroll and then went back into Riverdance. \n\"In 2009 I came back to Calgary to get my degree in communications,\" says McCaffrey who now works for Calgary Opera. \nIn 2013 he received a call from the London producers of a new dance show called Heartbeat of Home. \nThey wanted him to perform as the principal dancer in the Irish dance section. \n\"I was completely blown away when that offer came. I never thought I'd be in a major dance show again because I was 30 years old and I had a partner and a life here in Calgary.\" \nMcCaffrey's partner urged him to return to the stage which McCaffrey admits \"is the hardest thing I've ever done. \n\"I was now the oldest Irish dancer in the show and I had to get into the same physical condition as all those younger dancers but it was definitely worth the pain once I got back on stage for those 18 months.\" \nMcCaffrey received another call earlier this year asking him if he would make a special guest appearance in Riverdance: The 20th Anniversary Tour that is scheduled to play the Jubilee Auditorium for five shows Oct. 9 through 11. \nMcCaffrey will perform for the 7:30 p.m. show Oct. 11 only. \n\"I couldn't say no. It's one night only and it is such a nice way to cap off my long and colourful career by being able to dance at the Jubilee in front of friends and family.\" \nRiverdance is one of the most beloved and successful dance shows ever created. \nThrough its numerous international companies, Riverdance has played to more than 25 million people worldwide over the course of 20 years. \nRiverdance: The 20th Anniversary Tour is being sponsored by Broadway Across Canada and tickets are available through Ticketmaster.
