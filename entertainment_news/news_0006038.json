LOUIS , Oct. 14, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Every year, over 5 million U.S. homeowners replace their roof. It's usually a decision Mother Nature forces people to make. Every roof has a finite life; however, wind, rain, temperature extremes and weather events such as hurricanes and tornadoes can go a long way toward making that life shorter. Some roofs last less than ten years. That means the homeowner forced to replace an asphalt shingle roof now must almost immediately begin to figure out when it will need to be replaced again.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151013/276466\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151013/276467\nThe desire for a more durable, permanent roof is driving many homeowners to choose metal roofing. As Dave Yoho and Jim Cory point out in their recently published e-book, Above All You Need A Great Roof , today's metal roofing offers homeowners the opportunity to cover their house with a roof that lasts for as long as they live in the home. The book walks consumers through the entire process of replacing a roof, including identifying the need for a roof, choosing a quality installer, and comparisons of various roofing systems. Download a free copy of the e-book .\nOf all the different materials a homeowner could choose for a roof, metal offers the best track record when it comes to durability and longevity, and offers a wide variety of styles, colors and looks. The book points out that unlike asphalt shingles, which begin to degrade immediately on installation, metal roofing-much of which is galvanized steel-remains intact for decades. That quality is reinforced by some of the strongest product warranties in the roofing industry.\nThe Metal Roofing Alliance (MRA), a not-for-profit group, has tracked the growth of residential metal roofing from low single digits in the early 90s to more than 10% today. The product continues to gain popularity as more contractors become familiar with installing it, and builders now offer metal as an option on new homes. Consumers can download the free book, learn more about metal roofing, and even upload a photo to see how their home would look with a metal roof on the organization's website, www.MetalRoofing.com .\nContact:\nMarybeth Morsberger\n919-636-8091\n releases/need-a-new-roof--free-e-book-consumer-guide-now-available-300159215.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=PH27074&Transmission_Id=201510140835PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH27074&DateId=20151014", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/need-a-new-roof--free-e-book-consumer-guide-now-available-300159215.html", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151013/276466", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151013/276467", "http://www.metalroofing.com/v2/content/metal-roofing/above-all-book-download-form.cfm", "http://www.metalroofing.com/"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:37:08.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
