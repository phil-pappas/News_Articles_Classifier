She chose to harness all of her energy and try and do something creative as opposed to negative,\" he said. \n“I mean, I wish that sheer act of creativity could have changed the course of her illness but it couldn’t.” \nHere's another trailer for \"A Woman Like Me:\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:43:32.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
