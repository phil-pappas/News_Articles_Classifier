The 25-year-old superstar is said to have pocketed around $317.8 million since January this year, meaning she's been making more than 1 million dollars per day. In addition to her massively successful \" 1989 \" album and the \"1989\" world tour she's been on, the singer's money came from a handful of lucrative endorsement deals with brands like Elizabeth Arden and Diet Coke. \"Right now, Taylor is untouchable, \" said L.A.-based media analyst Mike Raia. \"She is so far ahead of everyone else in the industry that she has become not only a powerhouse entertainer but also an important mover and shaker on the commercial side on the music business.\" Prior to the Express report, Forbes announced Swift and her boyfriend Calvin Harris as the world's highest-paid celebrity couple of 2015 . With $146 million they collectively earned over the last year, the duo beat out reigning power couple Beyonce Knowles and Jay-Z . Showing no sign of slowing down, Swift is expected to reach billionaire status before she turns 30. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T09:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:30:13.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
