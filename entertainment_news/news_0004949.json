In an interview with the latest issue of Allure, she revealed about why she and the Muse frontman decided to call it quits after getting engaged in April 2011. \"Relationships ending are painful, and you can choose to carry that or you can choose to reframe it,\" the 36-year-old movie beauty shared to the magazine. \"If Matt and I had a great relationship, we would still be together, but we chose to move on because we had different visions of how we wanted to live our lives,\" she continued revealing, adding, \"That doesn't mean, though, that we can't rebuild something that would be the best thing for the kids.\" A photo posted by @allure on Oct 15, 2015 at 4:35pm PDT \"We said, 'We need to try to create something for the kids where they feel like they're gaining something rather than losing something,'\" Kate told Allure . \"It's been a seamless transition. Kids just want to see their parents be cool. Everybody's cool; everybody's good.\" Despite the broken engagement, Kate admitted that she is not ruling out the chance of finding new love in the future. \"Being someone who has come from a broken family and has a stepfather, I really benefited from having that very consistent [presence] in my life,\" she said. \"It's something I am mindful of and want in my life.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T17:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:47:58.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
