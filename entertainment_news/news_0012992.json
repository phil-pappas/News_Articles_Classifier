The 2015 AFROFUTURISM Series will be Renegade Performance Group's first season in the company's founding city, Brooklyn, NY.\n\"Much of the work and ideas engaging AFROFUTURISM have existed in artistic mediums outside of the body such as music, film, literature, and visual art. Our aim with the AFROFUTURISM Series is to use dance and performance to create new narratives and intersect technology using the living body as a medium,\" Renegade Performance Group's artistic director and interdisciplinary artist, Andre Zachery , shares. \"RPG's new works examine various actions, traditions, and innovations that constantly establish a new framework for Black existence -- one beyond usual stereotypes, tropes or expectancies. The idea of the future and its possibilities exist in everyone from every culture. Our hope is to allow the audience to experience something unknown about this possibility!\"\nThe AFROFUTURISM Series features collaborations with sound artists and composers Ivonne K. Paredes and Jeremy Toussaint-Baptiste, graffiti & visual artist Aaron \"Spazecraft\" Lazansky, and costume designer Joy Havens. The performers of RPG including Sarah Chien, Shiloh Hodges, Cameron McKinney, Candace Thompson and Nehemoyia Young, represent the diversity of Brooklyn in nationality, identity, gender and dance backgrounds. RPG is building a new future with every artistic venture.\nCoined by cultural critic Mark Dery in the 90s, Afrofuturism refers to the growing artistic movement that incorporates cultural aesthetic that combines artistic elements of science fiction, historical fiction, fantasy, Afrocentricity, and critiques narratives of people of African descent in a sci-fi, futuristic treaties. Renegade Performance Group's collective body of work for the season seeks to inspire and forge a stronger self-identity and respect for humanity AFROFUTURISM as a movement expresses new and progressive narratives, ideologies and symbols representative of Black culture from a global Diasporan perspective. With dance and new media innovation, Renegade Performance Group is poised to lead a critique of the evolving identity and present-day dilemmas of people of color using dance and performance art as the framework for the next phase of the AFROFUTURISM movement.\nThe performance season will run four nights, from 4-7 November at the Irondale Center, located at 85 South Oxford Street Brooklyn, NY.
