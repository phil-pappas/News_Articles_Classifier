By Alex Osborn \nHead of Xbox Phil Spencer is unsure as to whether or not Microsoft will be able to catch up to Sony's \"huge lead\" with PlayStation 4, thanks in large part to Xbox One's rough start. \n\"You know, I don't know,\" Spencer replied at the 2015 GeekWire Summit (via Videogamer ) when asked whether or Xbox One will be able to surpass PlayStation 4. \"You know, the length of the generation,\" he continued. \"They [Sony] have a huge lead and they have a good product. I love the content, the games line-up that we have.\" Got feedback on our player? We want to hear it. \nWith regard to why Microsoft has so much ground to gain, the Xbox boss continued: \"One thing that probably I didn't realize as much as I should have when I started in this role was the impact that the launch had on our team here in Redmond, the Xbox team. Because it's easy to read the blogs and the sites and my Twitter feed and see what the customers think of our brand and our product, but the team in Redmond took as much of a hit as the external community did around the launch.\" \nSpencer went on to cite the addition of backwards compatibility as a major step forward in reclaiming support from the gaming community, as Microsoft's focus isn't necessarily about beating the competition, but rather winning over consumers. \"So I would never question the ability of our organization, but I'll say we're not motivated by beating Sony, we're motivated by gaining as many customers as we can,\" he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T20:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:01:30.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
