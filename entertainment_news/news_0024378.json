(Gene Page/AMC) (SPOILER ALERT: The following post contains significant plot points from Sunday night's episode of \"The Walking Dead\" on AMC): \n\n\"The Walking Dead\" was back at it Sunday, delivering another intensely riveting episode titled \"JSS\" that jacked up the body count and just might have influenced your stance on the whole gun-control debate. \nAnd, yes, now we know what caused that God-awful horn to pierce the Virginia air. \nIt turns out that, while Rick and his rock quarry gang were off trying to herd the zombie horde westward, those hostile scavengers known as the Wolves decided that this was the perfect time to attack Alexandria. What they didn't count on was the staunch resistance of Carol, Morgan, Carl and a few others. Christian Serratos as Rosita Espinosa in 'The Walking Dead.' (Gene Page/AMC) \nWhen it was all over, the Wolves -- what remained of them -- were beating a hasty retreat. But they left plenty of damage (and several casualties) in their wake and that horn may have been blaring long enough to throw Rick's risky plan into complete disarray. \nOnce again, \"Walking Dead\" showrunner Scott Gimple and company have given us an episode that slyly plays with narrative structure and the time frame. It starts with a flashback involving Enid and her parents, who were the victims of a zombie attack that left Mom and Dad dead. For a while, it fooled me into thinking we were watching a stand-alone episode devoted solely to Enid. And though I was intrigued by the prospect of finally learning more about this moody, closed-off teen, I was miffed that we weren't immediately returning to the action precipitated by last week's tension-filled opener. Advertisement \nBut after watching Enid make her way through the woods and learn to survive on her own -- while leaving, in some form, the letters JSS everywhere she goes -- the opening credits roll and we return to Alexandria -- just before the Wolf attack goes down. \nHere we get immediate hints that Carol is starting to resist the fake Susie Homemaker persona she has exuded since arriving in the so-called safe zone. While in the pantry, she barks at a woman about her smoking (a \"nasty habit\" that will kill you). And later, she snaps and poor mopey little Sam, who is hanging out on her porch and still mourning his dead father, Pete. \n\"Your dad hit you. It got him killed,\" she snarls. \" ... Move on. Go home!\" \nAh, some heavy-handed foreshadowing here. The writers are letting us know, in an overly obvious way, that Carol is shifting back into bad-ass mode and her fierceness will help Alexandria's residents survive the coming attack. \nSure enough, moments later Carol sees a grubby intruder hack the smoker woman with a machete. Then, suddenly someone is firebombing the walls of Alexandria. There's smoke and chaos and violence. Carl grabs her assault rifle. Morgan grabs his big stick. It's on! \nAnd how ruthless is Carol? When one of the Wolfs stabs an Alexandria woman in the abdomen, she kills him from behind. But then, as the woman collapses into her arms, moaning and making too much noise, Carol kills HER! (Gasp). \nFinally, we learn how all that horn blaring started. A semi truck is quickly approaching the walls of Alexandria. But Spencer, armed with a rifle up in the watch tower, opens fire on the truck. Its driver is hit. The truck veers out of control and slams into a wall and, yes, the horn goes off because the driver has become wedged up against it. Now, we are finally back in the time frame where we left off last week -- seeing the action from the perspective of the townspeople (while Rick and his crew are kept off-camera). \nFrom here on, most of the episode is devoted to the combat between the Wolves and the Alexandria residents and we again see that Morgan is repulsed by the kind of violence he is witnessing. Last week, he bristled while watching Rick in coldhearted bad-ass mode. This time it's Carol who is unnerving him. \nMorgan, after all, is the proverbial speak-softly-and-carry-a-big-stick kind of guy. He doesn't want to kill anybody. He just wants to bop 'em on the head a few times, tie them up and then, apparently, rehabilitate them, or something. Carol thinks that's a load of crap. She's a fan of guns and bullets. The better to defend herself and others. The NRA would love this woman. \nCarol also is a fan of cosplay. Fans will remember that, earlier in the series, she disguised herself as a zombie to fool the people in Terminus. For tonight's performance, she plays the role of a Wolf, painting a blood-red \"W\" on her forehead and donning a dark hood, etc. It works like a charm as Carol continually gets the jump on her unsuspecting enemies and guns them down in cold blood. \nMeanwhile, Morgan is doing his thing with the stick. Bap.! Bap.! Bap.! he goes, as if this was one big Whack-a-Mole carnival game. A couple of the Wolves recognize him. He's the guy they tried to attack earlier in the woods. One of them tells Morgan that \"we're freeing you,\" that \"people don't belong here anymore.\" \nWhatever. Bap.! Bap.! Bap.! \nAs all this is happening, Carl is doing his part to put down the invasion. He tells Enid to stay in the house with baby Judith while he hunts the Wolfpack. At one point he kills a Wolf who is about to kill Ron. But Ron, still ticked off at Carl's dad, Rick (and perhaps jealous of Carl's relationship with Enid), refuses to heed Carl's plea to come inside the house. Off he goes. \nFinally, the battle ends, but Morgan is in no mood to reflect, or take stock of things. He passes Carol in the street and neither utters a word to the other. (I practically expected Carol to do a mic drop here). Morgan keeps walking toward the fence. Is he outtta here for good? \nMeanwhile, one person has, indeed, left the premises. Enid is gone, which isn't al that surprising. You always got the idea that this place wasn't her kind of hangout (\"It's too big to protect. Too many blind spots.\"). So she split, leaving Carl only a terse three-word note that explains what the \"JSS\" stuff was all about. \nJust Survive Somehow. \nSome random notes and observations: \n-- The show has smartly devoted just enough time to those who suffered major losses in last season's finale. Deanna is still in a major funk, even though Maggie is trying hard to pull her out of it. And it makes sense that Jessie and her boys, Ron and Sam, are reeling in various ways. But it was good to see Jessie take a major step in defending her home from intruders. \n-- That said, it will be interesting to see if Deanna will rally, or just fade into the woodwork. She sat out the entire battle, preferring to retreat and hide. There appears to be a power vacuum in Alexandria. Rick surely will be the one trying to fill it. \n-- Do you think we'll see Enid again? If not, will Carl go all mopey now? As I stated earlier, I, for one, remain at least somewhat interested in her back story. But will you miss her? \n-- We've seen this whole hardened survivor (Rick, Carol) vs. the maintain-my-humanity pacifist (Morgan) dynamic over and over on \"The Walking Dead.\" It's a beat that the show keeps playing and will probably continue to play in various forms. But are you tiring of it? \n-- Carol shedding a few tears near the end of the episode was as inevitable as it was predictable. It's the writers way of reminding us that, yes, there are still some shreds of humanity left in this character we so adore. \n-- Key question: If you were near death, would you rather be tended to by the surgeons of \"Grey's Anatomy\" during a Code Black situation, or by Denise during a Wolf Attack? \n-- So what now? Did that horn blare enough to sabotage Rick's zombie-herding plan? Or can he and the others get it back on track? Speaking of that plan, how do you feel about it? I saw a lot of reaction from viewers who thought it was ridiculous. One wondered why they just wouldn't set all the rock quarry zombies on fire. \nSo what did you think of \"JSS.\" Is the show still keeping you intrigued in Season 6? Or is starting to wear on you with its repetitive themes and storylines? \nContact Chuck Barney at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.ChuckBarney , or Twitter.com/chuckbarney", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T13:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T15:29:58.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
