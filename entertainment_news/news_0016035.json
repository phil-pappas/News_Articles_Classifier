The Whitney received 550 artworks by more than 75 American artists and the Pompidou got about 300 by some 40 European artists. \nThe Whitney exhibition will show about 100 works from both gifts, including pieces by Robert Adams, Diane Arbus, Cindy Sherman and Christopher Wool. \nAn exhibition at the Pompidou will follow, opening June 9, 2016. \nThe Wagners acquired many of the works when the artists were relatively unknown. They continue to collect. Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:57:16.306+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
