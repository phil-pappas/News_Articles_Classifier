It's a feeling … I for the first time went through and it's not fun.\"\nThe next day Saad got the word: He was no longer a Blackhawk. He had been traded to the Blue Jackets. Suddenly, one of the building blocks of the Hawks' future was sent packing in the most surprising move of the summer.\n\"You never think it's going to be you until it actually happens,\" said Saad, who will face his former Hawks teammates for the first time when the Blue Jackets visit the United Center on Saturday night. \"Going back and forth with numbers, years (and) things like that, we didn't see eye to eye so at the end of the day it had to be done.\"\nNot long after the trade, Saad signed a six-year, $36 million deal with the Blue Jackets that was believed to be worth considerably more than Hawks general manager Stan Bowman was offering.\n\"I don't think we really ever got too close,\" Saad of talks with the Hawks. \"At the end of the day it's a business. You see how many other guys left Chicago; guys you never think that would leave. As players, that part is never fun. You just want to get on the ice and play hockey.\"\nSaad is playing hockey at a high level for the winless Blue Jackets, leading them in goals with three through the first four games. The welcome he has received in Columbus has eased the transition.\n\"The guys have been great so that helps, but any time you're moving cities and moving teams it's definitely an adjustment,\" Saad said. \"But they've made it feel like home.\"\nIn the Jackets dressing room at Nationwide Arena, Saad's stall is flanked by those of captain Nick Foligno and one his alternates, Brandon Dubinsky. The veterans are getting a full dose of the player the Hawks nicknamed 'Man-Child' because of Saad's maturity level at a young age.\n\"He's wise beyond his years,\" Foligno said. \"It's kind of funny to say that (because) he's only 22, but he conducts himself and acts like a really veteran guy. You can see it in the way he prepares himself. What I was most proud of is he came in here and didn't change anything about himself. He's just trying to play his game and sometimes for a younger guy who has a big contract or comes to a new team, it can be intimidating. But he's been solid on his values. It's been enjoyable sitting next to him.\"\nSaad, who expects to receive his 2015 Stanley Cup championship ring before Saturday's game, credited much of the growth in his game to playing with former Hawks linemates Jonathan Toews and Marian Hossa.\n\"You learn everything, really, playing with guys like that who do all the little things, play both sides of the puck and have been around so long with the championships and the gold medals,\" Saad said. \"Both guys have so much and they're so humbled and so grounded, and they bring it every day and compete. It's really something special. I was fortunate to play with them.\"\nThe change in location spurred a maturing process for Saad. He went from renting a furnished apartment in Chicago to buying a house and the furniture to go with it in Columbus.\n\"That made me feel old,\" Saad said with a laugh.\nHe's also taking the time to discover the city, including attending the Paul McCartney concert on Tuesday night. Saad called Columbus \"up and coming\" and that he is \"settling in and I'm feeling more comfortable.\"\nAs far as his return to the United Center, the two-time Cup winner during his three-plus seasons with the Hawks expects to feel tugging on his heartstrings.\n\"There will be a lot of emotions going back and with getting the ring before the game and seeing old friends and faces,\" Saad said. \"It's going to be emotional for sure but exciting as well.\"\nckuc@tribpub.com\nTwitter @ChrisKuc\nPrivacy Policy Ice Hockey Brandon Saad Chicago Blackhawks Columbus Blue Jackets United Center Nick Foligno Brandon Dubinsky", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56210d24/turbine/ct-brandon-saad-blackhawks-blue-jackets-spt-1017-20151016"], "published": "2015-10-16T17:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:53:28.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
