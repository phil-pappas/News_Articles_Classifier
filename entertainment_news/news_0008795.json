The theory goes that coming of age during a severe market downturn will put you off stocks, and the risks they entail, for good.\nBut a recent study by the Vanguard Center for Retirement Research finds that technology can help us overcome past experiences.\nAccording to the report, the median allocation that millennials had in stocks in 2003 was 82 percent. In 2013, the allocation actually increased to 89 percent.\nMillennials are defined as those 18 to 34. Vanguard's study was based on 393 employer-sponsored retirement plans that were available in 2003 and 2013, and encompasses as many as 1 million plan-eligible employees.\nSo what happened? According to Vanguard, the answer is automation.\nIn 2003, less than 1 percent of the plans in Vanguard's study offered automatic enrollment, a feature in which employees are automatically enrolled in their workplace retirement plan, no signing up required.\nA decade later, the figure had jumped to 40 percent.\nOn top of that, more young people are now taking advantage of all-in-one funds, like target-date funds, that hold a balance of stocks, bonds and other investments.\nAs the author of the Vanguard study, Jean Young, noted in the report, \"millennials are more risk-averse than both Gen Xers and late boomers.\" But, she added, \"The data suggest that automatic enrollment and the rise of target-date funds have played substantial roles in changing saving and investment behavior.\"\nWhat if you're automatically enrolled in your employer's retirement plan? Here's what you can expect.\nThe Vanguard study found that, typically, the default contribution rate for those who are automatically enrolled in a workplace retirement plan is 3 percent.\nWhile that's better than not participating at all in your 401(k), it's a long way from the 10 percent or more that most financial advisers suggest putting away for retirement each year.\nThe good news is that the majority of 401(k)s with auto enrollment also have an auto-increase feature for contributions. In fact, according to Vanguard, 70 percent of auto-enroll plans automatically raise workers' contribution rates annually.\nKeep in mind, too, that by starting to save early in your 401(k) you get to take advantage of any matching contributions from your employer.\nAs such, in 2013, millennials who had automatically been enrolled in their company retirement plan were saving an average of 7.6 percent of their annual salary when the employer match was included.\nAuto enrollment not only helps you get started saving for retirement, it can also lead you to smart investment choices.\nIn many auto enrollment plans, target-date funds, which hold a balance of stocks, bonds and other investments that are appropriate for your age, are the default investment option.\nFor 20-somethings, a target-date fund will invest mostly in stocks, which are riskier than cash and bonds but usually produce higher returns over long periods of time -- key for young savers trying to build a nest egg.\nSo in 2013, the median allocation to stocks among millennials who had been automatically enrolled in their 401(k) was 89 percent. In 2003, the median allocation, whether a young person was auto-enrolled or not, was 82 percent.\nAnd thanks to target-date funds, fewer young people now have portfolios with zero or 100 percent stocks, what Vanguard calls \"extreme\" portfolios.\nIn 2003, 42 percent of millennials had extreme portfolios. A decade later, the percentage had dropped to just 3 percent for those auto-enrolled.\nAbout The Writer\nCarolyn Bigda writes Getting Started for the Chicago Tribune. yourmoney@tribune.com.\n(c)2015 Chicago Tribune\nVisit Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/business/businessnews/s-1740250&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/business/businessnews/s-1740250&h=Getting+Started%3A+Automatic+401%28k%29s+boost+savings+for+millennials", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/business/businessnews/s-1740250"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:15:42.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
