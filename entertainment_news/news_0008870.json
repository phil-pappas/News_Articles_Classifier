California is forecast to get more than the usual precipitation during the critical time its reservoirs usually fill, but there's no guarantee. Only northern tier states, the Ohio Valley states and Alaska should be dry.\nForecasters see a milder, warmer winter north of the Mason-Dixon line and for all of California and Nevada. Texas and the Deep South are forecast to be cold.\n Nation/World Science Lifestyle Associated Press", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-15T18:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:38:35.454+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
