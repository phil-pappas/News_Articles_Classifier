It made me feel validated and like I accomplished something because the Queen thing was a big challenge and kind of intimidating. So coming off of that and feeling like it was a victory was really good.'' \nAdam is known for his flamboyant image and admits his outer confidence means people often unfairly assume he's a diva. \nHe told Sch√∂n! magazine: ''I think when you wear eccentric clothing and you perform confidently on stage it's easy to assume someone is an asshole or a diva or whatever and I don't think I am. I'm sure I've had my moments but I think I'm pretty friendly.'' \nAnd the 'Ghost Town' singer - who shot to fame when he competed on 'American Idol' in 2009 - also finds it frustrating that he doesn't get enough credit for his ideas. \nHe added: ''I think one of the other misconceptions is that a lot of the ideas and creativity doesn't come from me. Maybe because of where I came from with 'American Idol' or whatever. I think sometimes people go 'Why is the label making you do this.' No one's making me do anything. OK, I'm doing it. It is a team effort.'' Contactmusic", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T18:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T19:07:50.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
