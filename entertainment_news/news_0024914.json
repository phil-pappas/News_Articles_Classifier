Throw in some fancy footwork by a high-energy ensemble, and you have all the ingredients of a brassy, jazzy, carefree visit to the era of bobby-soxers and ballroom dancing. \nWhich this is — to a point.\nBut this world-premiere musical by Richard Oberacker (music, lyrics, book) and Robert Taylor (book and lyrics), directed by \"Hamilton's\" Andy Blankenbuehler, at the Paper Mill Playhouse through Nov. 8, also has something else in mind.\nThere is something serious, even dark, underlying this show about World War II vets who form a combo. \nThe plot has a family resemblance to \"The Full Monty.\" The castoffs here are not unemployed factory workers, but guys who fought in the Pacific and liberated Dachau, who watched their friends die, but have returned home to an America that rewards them with a company handshake and a request to kindly shut up about their problems. \nWhat brings them together, helps them bond, give them new purpose and new self-respect, is not — in this case — the prospect of reinventing themselves as male strippers, but the notion of forming a swing band and competing in a radio contest.\nHappily for them, the actors in \"The Bandstand\" are not required to strip down to their so-to-speak for the climax. What they are required to do is really play the piano, saxophone, trumpet, trombone, bass and drums.\nThere are two bands in \"The Bandstand.\" There is a 12-piece ensemble in the pit, conducted by David Kreppel. And there are the six principal actors — seven, if you count the singer who signs on to become the chanteuse of the outfit — who do their own actual music-making. All of them are terrific players. The overall effect — especially when the musicians up top join forces with the players down below — is often electric.\nCorey Cott, last seen in this neighborhood in the musical \"Newsies,\" is Donny, the hothead pianist who forms the band. His chops are great, in the playing and singing department, in songs like \"Right This Way\" and \"Donny Novitski.\"\nHe's flanked by a talented group of musician-actors. There's Brandon J. Ellis as Davy, the bass player with a penchant for drinking, quoting Shakespeare, telling bad guy-walks-into-a-bar jokes, and losing his temper. There's Joey Pero as Nick, the irritable trumpet player, and Geoff Packard as Wayne, the big stiff of a trombonist. There's James Nathan Hopkins as Jimmy, the bookish saxophonist whose knowledge of the law proves crucial to the story. And there's Joe Carroll as Johnny, the hapless, war-damaged drummer who asks questions like \"What day of the week is Sunday?\"\nThen there is Laura Osnes as Julia, the lady with the pipes — and a tragic back story about a husband lost in combat, reminding us that war is hell on the home front, too (the show's concern with veterans' issues is, of course, timely).\nOsnes, late of \"Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella,\" knows how to put over a tune. Even one as intense as — but let's not spoil the ending. \nDo we need to say that Julia the singer and Donny the bandleader eventually make beautiful music together? We do not.\nThe love story, predictable but not unpleasant, has another key component. The winning Beth Leavel (\"The Drowsy Chaperone\") plays Julia's canny mom, who has wise counsel about guys (\"Men Never Like To Talk\") and other things. Her big second act song, \"Everything Happens,\" about the senselessness of life's tragedies, reminds us that existentialism was also part of the fallout of World War II: \"The Stranger\" came out in America in 1946, a year after \"The Bandstand\" takes place.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:29:07.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
