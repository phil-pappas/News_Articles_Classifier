The benefit of being naked, presumably, being that no one’s clothes are ruined by said white stuff.\nCyrus and the Lips are going out on the road in November and December as Miley Cyrus & her Dead Petz, playing six theatre and club shows in Chicago, Detroit, Washington DC, New York, Philadelphia and Boston. It is not known if any of those will be designated the naked show.\nBoth the Flaming Lips and Cyrus have previously disrobed in the name of art. Cyrus appeared naked in her video for Wrecking Ball , while Coyne was stripped of his clothes in the video for the Flaming Lips’ Watching the Planets .\n Oh fuck..!!! @mileycyrus is planning a show where her, the band ( us ) and the audience are all COMPLETELY naked with milk ( well white stuff that looks like milk) is being being spewed everywhere .. It's a video ( in the works) for #mileycyrusandherdeadpetz song The Milky Milky Milk... @stevendrozd @derek_levi_brown @mileycyrus @katyweaver @spacefacemusic @rockworth @leochandler @fantastic_ley @jgeeezus @zacharyancox @alphachanneling @mugglinstagram @monamuseum @happyhippiefdn @waynez__world @weirddestiny @drc3p0 @damienhirst #flaminglips #waynecoyne #mileycyrusandherdeadpetz #theflaminglips\nA photo posted by Wayne Coyne (@waynecoyne5) on Oct 13, 2015 at 9:14am PDT\nThis article was written by Guardian music, for theguardian.com on Wednesday 14th October 2015 08.40 Europe/London guardian.co.uk © Guardian News and Media Limited 2010", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/p/8yLorpp-7l/", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/4658593/04-noNetworks-noAdsense-mpu&sz=300x250&t=vertical%3Dhome&mob=js&c=", "http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/06/miley-cyrus-dead-petz-kitty-empire-review-wayne-coyne", "http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/03/01/poweredbyguardian.png", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My2FRPA3Gf8", "http://gu.com/p/4d9pf", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/4658593/04-noNetworks-noAdsense-mpu&sz=300x250&t=vertical%3Dhome&mob=js&c=", "http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/sep/29/miley-cyrus-10-of-the-best", "https://vimeo.com/7117985"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:21:08.179+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
