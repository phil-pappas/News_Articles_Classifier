Has Mulligan ever had to fight for equal pay during her career? \n\"Probably, but without knowing,\" she answers. \"Because I'm not, I haven't sort of done lots of big blockbuster films so there's not sort of an obvious discrepancy I don't think, but I'm sure it's happened and I just haven't known about it, because it is so rife in our industry.\" \nSuffragette is slowly rolling out across the country, starting Friday. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
