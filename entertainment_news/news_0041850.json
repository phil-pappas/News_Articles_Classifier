In movies, it's really sort of the opposite. \nIt's actually sometimes easier, seeing a film, to see where it went wrong. Why did the studio insist on doing this as a PG-13? Whose bright idea was it to cast Adam Sandler? Often, figuring out where it first went seriously right, though, is a harder task. \nWith \"Goosebumps,\" though, I think the first success was getting an original story by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. \nThey're the offbeat screenwriting team that, over the years, has given us everything from \"Ed Wood\" to \"The People Vs. Larry Flynt\" and while some of those projects went awry – I was not the big fan of \"Big Eyes\" I wanted to be – the trouble was never in their concepts. \nAnd their concept for \"Goosebumps\" is a smart one. \nHow do you make a movie about an entire library full of YA horror books? By writing a story about an entire library full of YA horror books coming to life – and their real-life author, R.L. Stine, trying desperately to round his characters up and get them safely back between covers before they destroy everything.As story gimmicks go, that one's scary good. \nAlexander and Karaszewski just did the story, though; after them it became a screenplay by Darren Lemke, directed by Rob Letterman and, frankly, a few problems popped up, mostly with tone. Yes, this is a horror comedy. No, no actor should ever be playing it as if they knew it were a comedy. \nThat advice is lost on a number of the supporting actors, and especially on star Jack Black. Black (who was also in Letterman's awful \"Gulliver's Travels\") plays this fictionalized version of Stine (who himself gets a quick cameo at the end), and he spends most of the movie snacking noisily on the scenery. \nOf course, this is Black, through and through – an old-style entertainer who craves your affection, or at least attention. But someone needed to get him to rail in the manic eyebrows and the prissy diction. The more seriously he took this, the funnier it would be. \nBut the two young leads – Dylan Minnette, who is our hero, and Odeya Rush, who looks a little like a baby Mila Kunis and is our heroine – are appealing without being cutesy or smart-alecky. And the pace is great, with the last hour being an all-out monster attack, as all of Stine's creatures – a werewolf, zombies, a mummy, murderous garden trolls and a particularly sarcastic ventriloquist's dummy – go on the rampage. \nA word to parents though. Despite the PG rating, this is not a movie for the very small. Although there's no gore, there's plenty of peril, and even if Black is having a giggle, these fiends are playing it straight – especially those undead creatures who crawl out of the graveyard at night. If you take a little one, expect them to have some unpleasant dreams. And don't blame me if you join them. \nRatings note: The film contains scary monsters and a few shocks.
