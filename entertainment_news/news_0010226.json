I have been racking my brain about what more could have been done or should have been done. I will continue to speak out and do whatever I can from whatever position I’m in to honor the memory of those we lost and to work as hard as I know to try to create more understanding and cooperation between the State Department, our diplomats, our development professionals from USAID and the Congress, so that the Congress is a partner with us, as was the case in previous times.\n\"I would like us to get back to those times,\" she added. \"I’m an optimist, congressman. I’m hoping that that will be the outcome of this and every other effort so that we really do honor not only those we lost but all those that right now as we speak are serving in dangerous places representing the values and the interests of the American people.”\nPhoto: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\nThree hours earlier, when the hearing began, Clinton said, “I’m here. Despite all the previous investigations, and all the talk about partisan agendas, I’m here to honor those we lost. My challenge to you, members of this committee, is the same challenge I put to myself. Let’s be worthy of the trust the American people have bestowed upon us.”\nRight before the hearing adjourned, committee chair Trey Gowdy and ranking Democrat Elijah Cummings yelled at each other about the emails of Clinton friend Sidney Blumenthal. It felt like the hearing had briefly turned into a therapy session for all the frustrations each had about the committee: Gowdy's worries that no one was taking it seriously, and Cummings's complaint that it shouldn't have existed in the first place.\nPhoto: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\nClinton watched the back-and-forth with a smile — a rare departure from the array of unimpressed, bemused, or frustrated facial expressions she appeared to have prepared specifically for today. Those looking for confirmation of Clinton's ability to convey all of her disapproving thoughts about a congressional committee in one stare — a gift she showcased in the last hearing on Benghazi — have been rewarded with a veritable feast of photographs to unpack.\nClinton as Gowdy and Cummings fight pic.twitter.com/gpTIUUcnJm\n— Jose A. DelReal (@jdelreal) October 22, 2015 When asked about the Blumenthal emails, Clinton responded, “I don’t know what this line of questioning does to help us get to the bottom of deaths of four Americans.\"\nThe \"let&apos;s keep our voices down to about here\" versus the \"I&apos;m leaving through that door over there right now.\" Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\nGowdy defended the committee — which has faced heat from those who think it has done little but attack Clinton — several times during the hearing. “This is not a prosecution,\" he said. \"I’ve reached no conclusions.” At another point, he reiterated that — despite Clinton's presence in the room — Gowdy had higher aims. “There are people — frankly in both parties — that have suggested that this investigation is about you. It is not.\"\nI&apos;ve had it up to here with these questions. Photo: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\nThere have been few surprises in the hearing so far; Republican members of the committee have asked aggressive questions about Clinton's emails, while the committee's Democratic members have worked on mentioning their disapproval of the committee or fact-checking the remarks of their colleagues. Clinton has responded to the many queries in a voice so calm it might put a devoted NPR listener to sleep. The hearing seems unlikely to change any opinions on Benghazi — those who agree with Trey Gowdy will likely come away from today thinking that he won, and those who think Clinton is facing an unfair congressional prosecution will find evidence for their belief. The many voters who haven't been paying attention to the Benghazi or private-email controversies are unlikely to find a reason to tune in today.\nThe &apos;Oh God, Why Did I Ever Go Into Politics\" face.
