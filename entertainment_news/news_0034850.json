Dutch Safety Board (DSB) chairman Tjibbe Joustra briefed reporters Tuesday on the findings of the final report into the incident — which does not say who was responsible — and showed them a reconstruction of the front of the Boeing 777.\nThe investigators found the surface-to-air missile exploded less than a yard from the cockpit, killing three crew members. The front of the plane broke off and the aircraft came down over eastern Ukraine, where a conflict was raging between Russian-backed separatists and government forces.\nUkraine should have closed its airspace to civil aviation, Joustra said. “None of the parties involved recognized the risk from the armed conflict on the ground,” he said.\nVery confronting.

Russia has denied involvement in the incident on July 17, 2014, that killed all those aboard.\nUkraine says the missile was launched in Snizhne, an area controlled by Russian-backed separatists.\nOn Tuesday, the Russian state-controlled manufacturer of Buk missiles said its own investigation contradicts that report's conclusions.\nClaudio lost his husband Glenn - this is the first view of aviation report #MH17 pic.twitter.com/Q5mwtXSnsd\n— anna holligan (@annaholligan) October 13, 2015 Almaz-Antey, said it conducted two experiments — in one of which a Buk missile was detonated near the nose of an airplane similar to a Boeing 777 — that dispute the report's conclusion. The experimental aircraft’s remains showed a much different submunitions damage pattern than seen on the remnants of MH17, the firm said in a statement, the AP said.\nSpeaking at a news conference before the Dutch report's release, the firm's head Yan Novikov said: “We have proven with our experiments that the theory about the missile flying from Snizhne is false.\" He said evidence shows that if the plane was hit by a Buk, it was fired from the village of Zaroshenske, which Russia says was under Ukrainian government control at the time.\nRobert Latiff, a retired Air Force major general who is now a professor at University of Notre Dame, said if separatists launched the missile, they probably lacked training in the weapons system, which includes radar and communications technology to track a plane’s transponder identification code. Russian troops would have been too professional and disciplined to make that kind of error, Latiff said.\n“The people who ‘pulled the trigger,’ so to speak should have, as a matter of training, insured that the target was not a commercial aircraft by checking for this code first,” Latiff said. “I suspect this was not the case, and some nervous, anxious, or trigger-happy soldier was at fault.”\nThe Dutch Safety Board investigated the incident because 193 of the people on board were from the Netherlands. The plane’s voice and data recorders were recovered within days of the crash.\nThe cockpit voice recorder offered no clues that the crew was aware they were about to be shot down. Two bursts of sound were captured in the final 20 milliseconds of the recording, with each lasting only four one-hundreds of a second. “Crew communication gave no indication that there was anything abnormal with the flight,” the Dutch report said.\nUSA TODAY\nWhat caused Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 disaster? We'll know more Tuesday\nUkraine received information in June 2014 that “illegal armed units within the area” possessed portable surface-to-air missiles, according to the report. Ukraine’s military aircraft were being shot at and shot down.\nOn June 5, Ukraine ordered civil aircraft to fly at least 26,000 feet above the conflict territory. By July 14, three days before the Flight 17 incident, Ukraine raised the order for planes to fly at least 32,000 feet high. The order came the same day a Ukranian Antonov An-26 military transport aircraft was shot down.\nBut European air traffic control found that the restrictions did little to reduce flights over the region, a popular route for flights between Europe and Asia. After the airspace was closed where Flight 17 was shot down, the number of flights over all of Ukraine fell from about 1,300 daily to 700, according to the report.\nWreckage also helped investigators piece together what happened. But investigators found it difficult to reach the crash site and gather evidence because fighting continued in the area.\nIn this July 17, 2014 file photo people walk amongst the debris of Malaysia Airlines flight 17, at the crash site of a passenger plane near the village of Grabovo, Ukraine. (Photo: Dmitry Lovetsky, AP)\nThe governments of Netherlands, Malaysia and Australia, which each lost travelers in the incident, have asked for an international tribunal to prosecute whoever shot down the plane. Russia vetoed the proposal at the United Nations Security Council, but Ukraine’s foreign minister said in July that another attempt would be made after the Dutch report was published.\nUSA TODAY\nMalaysia Flight 17 'black box' will not answer why\nThe incident was the second disaster in one year for Malaysia within a few months. Flight 370 went missing March 8, 2014, on a trip from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing and the search continues off the coast of Australia for the plane, after a wing part washed up on an island near Africa.\nThe Ukraine incident sparked a worldwide effort to get governments to share more information about conflict zones where planes should avoid flying. The issue is complicated because intelligence agencies that could warn where it is dangerous to fly don’t want others to figure out how they got their information.\nThe International Civil Aviation Organization, a branch of the United Nations that sets policies, set up a web page to check which countries have been declared no-fly zones.\nICAO\nConflict Zone Information Repository\nThe decisions about where to fly are hotly debated. For example, the European Aviation Safety Agency issued a warning Friday that warships were launching long-range missiles from the Caspian Sea at Syria, leading to flight risks above the Caspian Sea, Iran and Iraq. But the agency didn't urge airlines to avoid the region.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/annaholligan/status/653881288475209729", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c05fc816d491fb035461ae13eef58f569488979d/c=0-0-750-750/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/07/22/1406065524000-AFP-MALAYSIA-BLACK-BOX.JPG", "http://imgur.com/mml5gbd.jpg", "http://t.co/Q5mwtXSnsd", "http://cdn.onderzoeksraad.nl/documents/report-mh17-crash-en.pdf", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/10/12/what-caused-mh17-disaster/73808502/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/635802816018315074-MALAYSIA-17-WRECKAGE.JPG", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/MH17?src=hash", "http://t.co/Ofj3WEpazH", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bff476cf41fb4d1315a543652acb245d8a9830d5/c=50-0-973-694&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/635802816018315074-MALAYSIA-17-WRECKAGE.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a57cb87523081f89514984f1cf4f0c13e0b2f571/r=500x338/local/-/media/2015/10/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/635802816018315074-MALAYSIA-17-WRECKAGE.JPG", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/mh17?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/LisaMillar/status/653889167953395712", "http://www.icao.int/czir/Pages/default.aspx", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2014/07/22/malaysia-airlines-recorders-black-boxes-investigation/13012551/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4ae7b66041eede1bbe3998cefe4b1451e0b29ef5/c=1271-0-5111-3840/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/11/15/635516553858480009-AFP-535256265.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-13T10:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:04:01.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
