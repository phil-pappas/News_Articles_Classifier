Amid a terrible fire season, the U.S. Forest Service has had to transfer hundreds of millions of dollars to its firefighting budget, shifting money away from accounts that pay for fire-prevention and forest-restoration programs. KURT MILLER , STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Related article » The cost to extinguish the tens of thousands of fires that have burned millions of acres in California and across the country in 2015 has pushed the U.S. Forest Service budget past a tipping point.\nThis year, for the first time, more than half of the Forest Service’s fire budget will be spent on fighting fires, rather than preventing and preparing for them, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report.\nThat is forcing officials to transfer money from accounts that pay for fire-prevention and forest-restoration programs that help reduce the threat of catastrophic fires.\nThese transfers have taken place for years, but they have gone from an emergency measure to a standard practice. In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, a record $700 million was transferred to the firefighting budget, U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell testified to the House Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Subcommittee on Thursday, Oct. 8.\nThe transfers leave less money for the protection of watersheds and cultural resources, upkeep of hiking trails, programs and infrastructure that support thousands of recreation jobs and billions of dollars of economic growth in rural communities, the report said.\nMaintenance is being deferred on some roads that the public uses to access recreation areas and rural homes, and that fire crews drive on to reach fires.\nThose ripples are being seen – how much is unclear – in the San Bernardino National Forest, which includes much of the San Bernardino and San Jacinto mountains, and the Cleveland National Forest, which stretches from Corona almost to the Mexico border.\nAs of Sept. 29, the most recent date available, 50,030 fires have burned more than 9,084,655 acres in 2015, according to the National Interagency Fire Center, which tracks wildfires.\nAs climate change helps drive temperatures higher and humidity lower, the six worst fire seasons since 1960 have all occurred since 2000, said the Department of Agriculture report. Washington state has experienced its worst fire season ever in 2015.\nMeanwhile, a companion report said the effects of the budget transfers over the years have already been felt. The report listed projects that had been delayed by a lack of funding. Among them, the purchase of Fleming Ranch in the San Bernardino National Forest and land in the Santa Ana Mountains in the Cleveland National Forest.\nOfficials in the Inland forests referred questions about those projects and any other negative effects of the budget transfers to the Forest Service’s national office. Despite repeated requests for comment, spokespeople in Washington, D.C. could not find anyone to respond.\nCHANGE SOUGHT IN FIRE FUNDING The U.S. Forest Service’s budget related to fires is about $2.52 billion. The two largest components are $1.14 billion for preparedness and $708 million for suppression. So far this fire season, suppression has run up a record $1.7 billion tab, Tidwell said.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Forest Service, has called on Congress to change the way fire suppression is funded. Currently, fires – even those started by natural causes such as lightning – are not considered natural disasters. So suppression costs are not eligible to be paid for by the same Congressional appropriations that provide relief for disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes.\nThe California Legislature has endorsed the federal Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which would authorize the Federal Emergency Management Agency to request federal dollars to pay for wildfire suppression.\n“Fire borrowing was intended to be an extraordinary measure, but as fire seasons have grown more destructive, it has become common practice,” Rep. Michael K. Simpson, R-Idaho, the act’s lead sponsor, wrote in a letter to colleagues in Congress seeking co-sponsors. “Fire borrowing has created a devastating cycle that prevents agencies from doing needed hazardous fuels removal or timber harvests, leading to worse fires.”\nThe most recent action on the act, HR 167, came in March when it was referred to the House Subcommittee on Federal Lands in March. It has 138 co-sponsors.\nContact the writer: brokos@pe.com or 951-368-9569", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvxhdt-b88480239z.120151008175611000g1ucfvk4.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvxhdt-b88480239z.120151008175611000g1ucfvk4.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:18:14.899+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
