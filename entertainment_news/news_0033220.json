Veteran Shiv Sainik and State Environment Minister Ramdas Kadam trained his guns towards the minorities living in Maharashtra, demanding the government to send them to Pakistan. Labeling serious charges against the Muslim youth of Marathwada, Kadam alleged that they are being sent to the neighboring country where they receive training in arms and ammunition, only to return here and cause turmoil in the state. \n“A lot of Muslim youngsters from Marathwada are being sent to Pakistan,” Kadam claimed demanding Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis to take action in the matter. “I know we are in the government and need to act. I have asked the chief minister to hand over the charge of home ministry to me for a few words to address this problem,” he added. The Home department has been kept by Fadnavis himself.

The members of this community should be sent to Pakistan.” \nFollowing the scathing attack from Ramdas Kadam, Shiv Sena supremo Uddhav Thackeray also pitched up the ante, demanding the Centre to immediately begin the construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya and declare India as a ‘Hindu Rashtra’. \nThis is not the first instance when Shiv Sena chose to lambaste the Muslims living in Marathwada. Early, the far-right outfit’s patriarch Bal Thackeray made similar allegations. “Marathwada, which was earlier known as the land of saints, is now becoming the land of terrorists. It is soon turning into mini-Pakistan,” the late leader wrote in party’s mouthpiece Saamna in 2012. \n  9:34 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:11:01.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
