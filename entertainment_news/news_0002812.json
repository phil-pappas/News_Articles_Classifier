Oprah Winfrey beamed with pride Wednesday night at a private screening of her new seven-part TV series, “Belief,” which highlights faiths around the globe and how humans are all connected.\nWalking on stage following a screening of Episode 1 of “Belief: The Seekers,” Winfrey scanned the faces of the viewers, saying “wow!” to heavy applause before moderating a panel with producer David Shadrack Smith .\nIn the audience was Arianna Huffington , who discussed her own beliefs with Confidenti@l.\n“Yes, I believe in God, and as the series shows, even people who don’t believe in God believe in something beyond money and power, which are the two big goals in most people’s lives,” Huffington said. “What is clear in the series is that that’s not enough.”\nThe digital doyenne went on to say that even though she’s achieved both great money and power, “something higher” is a constant in her life.\n“(God has) become more and more important,” she said, adding that faith has helped her with her daughter Christina’s addiction issues, which she has been open about.\n“Well, I believed in something, and that made it much easier to feel that there must have been a hidden blessing,” she said. “Christina still writes every night, even now, and she’s been sober for almost four years. She writes down three things that she’s grateful for and she shares them with three friends.”\nWinfrey (inset), coming off 25 years of her own talk show, was at a professional low, she said, when at first her network, OWN, wasn’t turning a profit. “Belief” became an “ah-ha” moment for her.\n“Telling these kinds of stories is what I created a network to do so I thought regardless of what else, whatever demands are on my time, whatever else is going on, this is what I want to do,” she said.\nProducers Michael Davie and Eric Strauss , who spent three years flying around the world making the series, spoke about trusting the long and arduous process of making the show. Reshma Thakkar, who appears as one of the seekers in the first episode, told us she was startled to see her hands on a giant billboard for the show in Times Square.\nBEAT Magazine Beyonce pays tribute to Old Glory in pages of Beat magazine.

Guests on the rooftop of Gary’s Loft gazed up at illuminated water tanks with the Empire State Building just a block away. Editor-in-chief Carla Sosenko told Confidenti@l, “This party harnesses a lot of what we’re about-eating and drinking and dancing and music — so it’s been pretty unreal to get all these people in a room together who are totally into what we’ve been doing for two decades.”\nLIVE!

But when it turned out that the CNN host had a previous engagement and couldn’t make it, the missus took care of business. “His wife filled in beautifully and made the toast to the 18 people at the dinner,” we’re told.\nSTRIKING CLOSE TO ‘HOMELAND’ Artists hired to paint Arabic graffiti on the set of “Homeland” didn’t follow orders — and their disgruntled messages were broadcast to millions Sunday night. Angry with its portrayal of the Muslim world, the team scrawled “Homeland is racist” and “#blacklivesmatter,” among other messages. Alex Gansa , creator of the show starring Claire Danes , told the Daily News in a statement, “As ‘Homeland’ always strives to be subversive in its own right and a stimulus for conversation, we can’t help but admire this act of artistic sabotage.”\nGot some hot gossip for us?\nTipline: 212-210-1616\nE-mail: confidential@nydailynews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:57:24.555+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
