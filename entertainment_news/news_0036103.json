Kimberley Lim reports.   \nAward-winning singer Adele made her much-anticipated return on Friday. The British songstress unveiled her latest ballad after a three-year hiatus from the spotlight, featuring soaring vocals and plenty of heartache. She described \"Hello\" as \"intimate\" in an interview with BBC Radio 1. SOUNDBITE Singer, Adele, saying (English): \"I just obviously want people to like it. I really like it and when I wrote it, I knew that this would be the first thing that everyone heard from me because obviously even though it's not like, I hadn't even made up a lyric or anything like that 'Hello it's me everyone says', that is how you say 'Hello it's me', like when you call up someone, so it's sort of that reintroduction, I felt like when I started singing 'Hello it's me' I was like OK, this is what I'm going to say to everyone when I come back.\" The singer-songwriter surprised fans earlier this week when she tweeted that she would be releasing an album called \"25\". And she already looks set to storm back in to the charts with the tearjerker -- \"Hello\" is now one of the most in-demand songs on iTunes UK.  //reut.rs/203HxBJ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:41:21.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
