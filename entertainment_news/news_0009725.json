Millions of these fans have seen Joel perform live shows during one of his many massive world tours. But the opportunity to see him in the popular Florida locale on New Year's Eve will be the first of its kind. Joel played two shows at the venue back in January 2014, and he has also played the American Airlines Arena in Miami on a number of occasions. Florida fans are very good to the Brooklyn-born musician who has cemented his place in the rock 'n roll history books.\nIn the 1980s, he cemented his place as one of the most important global musicians by sharing his music with the world while taking political stances and traveling to distant countries that other superstars would not have dreamed of.\nThe BB&T Center is currently configured to hold between 15,000 and well over 21,000 fans for live concerts. It is not yet clear what type of stage configuration Billy Joel will be using, but it is safe to say that between 19,00 and 20,000 fans will witness the New Year's Eve show.
