He was 75.\nMayor Mitch Landrieu sat in the second row near chef Leah Chase. Behind him were two rows of Prudhomme's fellow restaurateurs, many wearing white kitchen jackets. John Folse, Tory McPhail and John Besh were just a few of the Crescent City culinary stars in attendance. Dozens of Prudhomme's restaurant employees were recognizable in black shirts and blouses adorned with white roses. Jacques Rodrigue, son of the Cajun artist George Rodrigue who died in 2014 and whose blue dog paintings grabbed the attention of the world at the same time Prudhomme's cooking style went global, attended as well.\nMarty Cosgrove, who was born, like Prudhomme, in Opelousas, and worked as an executive chef in Prudhomme's culinary empire for a quarter century, described the chef as a leader of the Cajun food craze in the 1980s. Prudhomme \"changed the image of a cook from a job to a career,\" Cosgrove said. And, despite his success as a restaurateur and the fame as a television culinary guru, Prudhomme remained \"the same gentle giant off camera as on.\"\nLegendary Paul Prudhomme laid to rest with second line parade (video) New Orleans Chefs, friends and family gather at St. Louis Cathedral at Jackson Square in New Orleans for a Mass for famed Chef Paul Prudhomme.\nPrudhomme, who started his career began as a teenager with a hamburger joint just Opelousas, went on to be the first non-European chef at Commander's Palace, before he and K Hinrichs, the woman he would marry, opened their restaurant, K-Paul's Louisiana Kitchen in July 1979. The chef's fame spread through tours, cookbooks and cooking shows and videos as well as his own spice line. He cooked for world leaders, while helping to kick-start the careers of chefs, such as a young Frank Brigtsen.\n[ Paul Prudhomme, an appreciation of a New Orleans culinary titan ]\n\"The human side of us grieves,\" the Rev. Robert Cooper said in his remarks, but \"we thank God for 75 years with Chef Paul.\"\nCooper went on to weave details from the story of Lazarus with details of the Last Supper into an allegorical tribute to the chef. He concluded by imagining St. Peter and Mary welcoming Prudhomme at the gates of heaven, where he probably began looking for the nearest kitchen to get back to work. Jesus, he said, would congratulate Prudhomme on a job well done.\nAs the Mass neared its end, Monsignor Andrew Taormina captured the congregation's attention when he addressed the mayor directly. He said he was reluctant to weigh in on the issue of removing certain of the city's Confederate monuments. If, however, that eventuality were to come to pass, he said, the city should consider replacing one with a statue of Prudhomme holding a blackened redfish. The late chef's extreme searing technique, called \"blackening\" became and remains a worldwide culinary phenomenon.\n[ Paul Prudhomme: An oral history chronicles a revolution in New Orleans food ]\nPallbearers hefted Prudhomme's coffin into a waiting hearse, as the Uptown Strutters brass band began \"St. James Infirmary Blues.\" Washboard maestro Rockin' Dopsie added rasping percussion and whistles to the sound that floated across Jackson Square.\nAs hundreds of spectators looked on, those who'd attended the service followed the hearse as it exited the square and rolled slowly toward the nearby restaurant at 416 Chartres St., with Prudhomme's wife Lori Bennett near the lead under a broad black umbrella.\nChef Paul Prudhomme, second line for a superstar Chartres Street saw a sentimental send off for Paul Prudhomme, a superstar among celebrity chefs, Monday (Oct. 12) morning, starting with a service in St. Louis Cathedral and finishing with a second line parade to K-Paulâ€™s Louisiana Kitchen restaurant. Prudhomme died Thursday (Oct. 8).\nWhen the memorial parade passed Toulouse Street, the brass band erupted into a joyous reprise of \"Just a Closer Walk With Thee,\" as scores of smart phone cameras captured the sudden change of emotional tone. The crowd, which included Ti Martin of Commander's Palace restaurant, where Prudhomme first found New Orleans fame, and pianist Ronnie Cole, slowly funneled into the legendary restaurant for a private lunch.\nA chant went up: \"Paul, Paul, Paul.\"\nBefore the memorial service had begun, in the bright October sunlight on Jackson Square, newspaper cameramen and television videographers staked out spots near the cathedral entrance, prompting passersby to ask what was going on. When they were told that a Mass for Prudhomme was about to begin, nearly all immediately recognized the name.\nAt the conclusion of the parade, chef John Folse, said that Prudhomme's success was measured in the number of people he touched with his generosity. \"I don't think I've seen a rock star get this much attention,\" Folse said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:32:07.338+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
