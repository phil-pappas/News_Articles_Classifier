So there went Mattea, with her mother, grandmother and sister in January. \nAs Mattea watched the show from their orchestra seats, though, she couldn't help but feel a tinge of disappointment. While Mattea was impressed by the acting and dialogue — especially that of the precocious lead character — she could so easily see herself in the starring role. \"I could have done that,\" Mattea told her family at the musical's end. \"Why didn't they pick me?\"Mattea had auditioned for \"Matilda\" at an open call in September 2014, at the encouragement of a family friend, but had not received a call back. \nLess than two months after she saw the show, however, the call came — and her journey from the audience to center stage began. \n\"Because she is a dancer, we naturally assumed that they wanted to see her for an ensemble role, because those kids do a lot more dancing than (the character of) Matilda,\" said Mattea's mother, Nicole Conforti. \n\"But we were confused, because she is so small, and (we) knew that she was not tall enough for any of those roles.\" Mattea Conforti, one of four young girls who share the title role in \"Matilda The Musical,\" poses in front of the Shubert Theatre. (John Munson | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com) \nActually, the role Mattea landed was much bigger. She is one of four young girls who share the title role of Matilda, a quick-witted youngster, with the gift of telekinesis. \nMattea did not have any formal training in acting or singing before being cast in \"Matilda,\" although she does take classes now. Before \"Matilda,\" her only experience on stage was as a performer with the Essex Dance Academy in Fairfield. \nThe musical is based on the children's novel by Roald Dahl. \"Matilda\" follows a young girl who loves to read and excels in her studies, despite being neglected by her parents. Matilda's gift ultimately helps her teacher to reclaim her life. \n\"As soon as I stepped on stage, my nerves went away, and I didn't need to worry anymore,\" Mattea said. \"That's when I knew that I could do it.\" RELATED : N.J. seamstress gains fame with BET Awards show dress \nMarie Fischbach, director of the Essex Dance Academy, describes Mattea as \"naturally very funny, animated, smart and witty.\" \nFischbach said Mattea's talent and huge personality were apparent from the time she joined the dance school at age 3.

(Joan Marcus) \nIn the eight weeks Mattea spent preparing for the role, she relied on advice from her instructors — on Broadway and back home in New Jersey — who told her that nervousness and excitement are the same thing. \nMattea is the smallest — just 4 feet tall — and youngest of the girls who play Matilda, so joining the show was a big adjustment. Mattea is on stage for 105 minutes of the 135-minute musical. \nFrom the time she was cast in May to her debut in July, Mattea rehearsed six days a week, working with everyone from choreographers to vocal coaches and diction teachers, who helped develop the \"nearly British accent\" required of her character. \nMattea said she tried to picture the scenes in her head as she studied the script, which helped her to memorize the lines. During the rehearsal process, she would also get homework for the show every night. \nBecause the show can be demanding on its young performers, Mattea's parents have made some adjustments, too. On performance nights, at least one of them always attends the show. They also try to drive Mattea into the city, so that she can sleep on the way home, her mother said. \nMattea performs in two shows each week and is on standby for two other shows. On the days that she works, Mattea leaves Jefferson Elementary School in Caldwell, where she is now a fourth grader, about 2:45 p.m. and returns home between 10 and 11:15 p.m., depending on curtain time. \nThe family always leaves room for Mattea to enjoy downtime at McCaffrey Playground near Times Square. The small park is a popular hangout for Broadway child stars. \n\"The show spends a lot of time trying to keep the kids kids,\" Nicole Conforti said. \"Which is why they're not allowed to take pictures or sign autographs after the show.\" \nNone of the children wear makeup and Mattea spends about five minutes getting her hair done before each show. \n\"They tease it a lot,\" she said. \"It's supposed to look like a mess, because her (Matilda's) parents don't care about her.\" \nIt is unlikely that Mattea will play Matilda for long, because of the age and height requirements for the starring role. \nBut until her contract expires in January, there will always be a couple of familiar faces looking up at her when she performs. \n\"It's still so emotional,\" Nicole Conforti said. \"I don't think it's ever going to get old.\" \nJanelle Griffith may be reached at jgriffith@njadvancemedia.com.
