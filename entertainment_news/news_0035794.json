Their annual dinner and auction was located at Blue Chip Casino for the first year ever and was also the first year that called for high-end Masquerade attire. The event serves as Housing Opportunities biggest single fundraiser and opportunity to bring awareness to what their services do for their community. \nHousing Opportunities is a non-profit organization that provides low income housing, housing for the homeless, a food pantry, and other services within Northwest Indiana. The Masquerade Ball is Housing Opportunities biggest fundraiser each year, and with a silent auction, electronic donations, and live auction the organization raised thousands of dollars during the event. It was also a black tie gala with dinner and dancing, but CEO Caroline Shook didn’t want the glitz to overpower the true reason for the Ball. \nClick here to see all the photos from the Masquerade Ball. \n“What we really wanted to do is to let people understand who is really homeless, because most people’s vision of who is homeless isn’t always who we serve - so that’s how we came up with the idea to go with the Masquerade theme to ‘unmask homelessness’.” Shook explained. “The event itself goes directly to funding our programs but in particular our temporary housing, and without tonight we wouldn’t have as many units for families to live in. So tonight is a celebration and a phonomenal night, but it’s also extremely important to our organization.” \nWith their message of unmasking homelessness rightly leaving a serious undertone throughout the night, Board Chair for Housing Opportunities Bradley Sweet said that the Ball was also a great opportunity to thank their donors by allowing them to have some fun. \n“Part of tonight's thanking all of these people for supporting our cause, because helping out the ones who need it the most is their interest as well.” Sweet stated. “It’s really important to give thanks one on one for what they do for our clients. Their support really lets them have a life that they wouldn’t of had otherwise. It means the world to Housing Opportunities to have so many guiding us along.” \nBesides the mingling, dinner, and bidding the focal point of the event was the ceremony that allowed Housing Opportunities to shine the spotlight on the people who have benefited from their services, and one who has aided in their mission. CEO Caroline Shook handed out awards to Volunteer of the Year, Success Story of the Year, and Business of the Year. \nAlyssa Bickett, who was named Success Story of the Year, also took a moment to speak about her experiences with Housing Opportunities. After her family had gone to the organization for help because of her mother's poor health when she was in middle school, Bickett is now in college for fashion design. She explained that though it’s nice being in the spotlight for a night, the real focus should be on what Housing Opportunities did for her and what they still do for others. \n“It’s actually really amazing to be recognized because most of the time I think I’m someone most people don’t look at, so being awarded for my accomplishments is really reassuring.” Bickett stated. “In the end, though, I really want people to know what Housing Opportunities does for so many. There are a lot of people out there who are disabled or have nowhere to go, and if it wasn’t for them a lot would be without a home. I think this is a very important and good thing to have in our community and more people need to put the spotlight on them.” \nThis may be the first year for Housing Opportunities’ Masquerade Ball, but because of the success of its first year the event will surely become a welcome tradition for the organization. \nWith women dressed in gorgeous gowns, men spiffed up in suits, and a venue that was fit for a elegant night, the Masquerade Ball on the surface was one that made all of the people who attended glad to be at on a Friday night. Underneath it all the fundraising and charity of the event shined through the glamour, and an organization like Housing Opportunities’ couldn’t of wished for anything better.
