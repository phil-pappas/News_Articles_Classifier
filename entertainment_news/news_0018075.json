Bob Casey, D-Scranton, says members of Congress opposed to raising the nation's debt ceiling should \"set aside their ideology and be focused on paying our bills.\" Now is \"not the time for games\" on nation's debt ceiling, Casey says 0 Lauren Victoria Burke/The Associated Press \nU.S. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Scranton, says members of Congress opposed to raising the nation's debt ceiling should \"set aside their ideology and be focused on paying our bills.\" \nWith the deadline for Congress to raise the nation’s debt ceiling less than two weeks away, U.S. Sen. Bob Casey said Wednesday that not doing so could have disastrous consequences for the economy and Americans. \n“This is not a debate that we should be having,” Casey, D-Scranton, said in a conference call with reporters, “because we should have more people willing to work in a bipartisan way to solve the problem.” \nCongress has until Nov. 3 to raise the country’s $18 trillion debt ceiling or the federal government could be left with only enough cash to pay its obligations for a week. Those obligations include Medicare, Social Security, veterans’ benefits, pay and benefits for active duty service members and supplemental security income. \nOfficials at the Treasury Department and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office also have said that Congress should raise the debt ceiling, Casey said. \nCasey, along with economist Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden who was also on President Barack Obama's economic team, stressed that raising the debt ceiling does not authorize additional spending, but only assures that the government can pay the bills it has already incurred. \nThe debt ceiling has been raised nearly 100 times since its inception in 1917 under presidents from both parties, including 14 times since 2001. It was only in recent years under Obama that raising the ceiling became a partisan fight with more conservative Republicans opposing the move and withholding their votes as leverage on other issues. \nJust threatening to not raise the ceiling “is bad for the economy and wasteful of taxpayer money,” Bernstein said. Some Republicans have proposed prioritizing payments, but Bernstein said that makes no sense when the government has 80 million separate payments to make each month. \n“Prioritization is simply the Republican word for default,” he said. \nBernstein said it is “incredibly hypocritical” for members of Congress to oppose raising the ceiling. “They’re basically saying that they don’t want to pay for things that they themselves have authorized,” he said. \nCasey said debt ceiling crises in 2011 and 2013 showed the negative effects uncertainty over America paying its bills can have on the economy. If the current ceiling is not raised it would hurt consumer confidence and rattle financial markets, Bernstein said. \nHome buyers would see interest rates spike and it would affect families financing their children’s college education, Casey said. “This is not the time for games,” he said. “This is the time for folks to come together and try and solve the problem like adults are supposed to.” Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:08:24.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
