(March 20 - April 19): You resent walking on eggshells, but make the extra effort today. Tensions say more about others' insecurities than yours.\nTAURUS. (April 20 - May 20): You find just the thing you've been looking for thanks to the Moon/Venus conjunction. Maybe it's a one-of-a-kind item or the final piece needed to complete a treasured collection.\nGEMINI. (May 21 - June 20): Did you give someone the impression you said yes when you meant no? Clear it up now before you wind up in hot water later.\nCANCER. (June 21 - July 21): There's a lot of disinformation being floated around this week. It will take careful sleuthing to distinguish fact from fallacy.\nLEO. (July 22 - Aug. 22): There has been so much back-and-forth lately that you may have a hard time remembering what you finally agreed to. Ask.\nVIRGO. (Aug. 23 - Sept. 22): You wrote off an acquaintance as a snake in the grass, so imagine your shock when she pulls your fat out of the fire. You'd best apologize - and fast!\nLIBRA.

(Oct. 23 - Nov. 21): You suspected something was up, but today's revelation is still a surprise. You'll need some time to ponder the repercussions.\nSAGITTARIUS. (Nov. 22 - Dec. 20): You tried being friends with someone but it's not clicking. Do a slow fade and maybe she won't notice.\nCAPRICORN. (Dec. 21 - Jan. 19): There's more to a romantic interest than meets the eye. Expect things to get deep. You'll appreciate the added dimension to your life.\nAQUARIUS. (Jan. 20 - Feb. 17): The Moon/Venus conjunction shows you choosing between two equally important relationships. Think personally rather than politically.\nPISCES. (Feb. 18 - March 19): Even you're mystified as to why you're obsessed with tracking down an obscure piece of trivia. Sometimes it can't be helped.
