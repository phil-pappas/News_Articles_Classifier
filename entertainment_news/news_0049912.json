I was a huge admirer of everyone who is in it. Nicola Walker as DCI Cassie Stuart and Sanjeev Bhaskar as DS Sunil Khan in Unforgotten (John Rogers/ITV) \n“What that doesn’t tell you is what they are like on set, and they are all terrific – not just lovely people, but fun. That was extraordinary to be around. It felt, very much for me, like I was getting acting lessons on a daily basis as well.” \nUnforgotten centres around a “cold” murder case committed 39 years ago, with the investigation prompted by the discovery of the bones of a young man, beneath the footings of a demolished house. \nSanjeev explained: “It’s like a bunch of dramas in one. It’s a police procedural thing, it’s a crime thriller, it’s a whodunnit. But it’s also a kind of family drama and a social drama. \n“What I really loved about it when I read the scripts was that you have the whodunnit elements – the reader and the viewer will try to guess who is the culprit or culprits. \n“But also the impact of carrying a lie for over 40 years… The knock on the door by the police opens up this Pandora’s box,” he added.
