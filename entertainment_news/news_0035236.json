By William Kerns A-J MEDIA ENTERTAINMENT EDITOR \nAny book about Lubbock music would include far too many chapters to be adapted into a one-hour documentary film. \nThat is why the closing film at the 11th annual Flatland Film Festival has the somewhat cumbersome title of “Flat Land and Open Skies: A Lubbock Music Story,” according to co-director Paul Allen Hunton. \nThe film will be screened at 7 p.m. Saturday at the Firehouse Theatre at LHUCA, 511 Ave. K. For those who did not purchase festival passes, tickets are $15 for the general public and $10 for students. \nConsider, too, that Hunton and co-directors Daniel Ballard and Jonathan Seaborn purposely kept the film at a length that would increase its chances of being picked up nationally by PBS. \nHunton knew that some topics, members of the Flatlanders being an example, had been covered before. “We know we’re leaving out many great stories, so we don’t call this a history of Lubbock music. This is just one of Lubbock’s musical stories,” he said. \nHunton, general manager at KTTZ-TV, already had some background in the form of the local public broadcasting station’s series of short documentaries called “24 Frames.” \nFilmmakers were aided immensely when many musicians on their list happened to be in the audience when Natalie Maines and Jo Harvey Allen were inducted into the West Texas Walk of Fame on Sept. 17. \nThe final film touches on Jack Thorp, Odis “Pop” Eckles, Norman Petty, Mac Davis, Terry Allen, the Maines Brothers Band, the Nelsons and the Thrift Store Cowboys. \nHunton feels there is a direct line from the old cowboy songs that Thorp began collecting in the late 1800s to the Thrift Store Cowboys almost a century later. \nN. Howard “Jack” Thorp published the first book of Western music, titled “Songs of the Cowboys,” in 1908. Containing only lyrics and no musical notations, most of these cowboy songs are of unknown authorship. \nLocal singer-songwriter Andy Wilkinson sings one of Thorp’s discoveries for the film. \nThe film also deals with radio influence “Pop” Eckles, who also was a member of the original Stamps Quartet, and the area’s gospel quartets, including the Lubbock Texas Quartet, which was active from 1929 to 1943. \nRather than centering solely on Buddy Holly, filmmakers opted to visit Norman Petty’s studio in Clovis, New Mexico. \nIt was at Petty’s studio, said Hunton, that the sound of popular music was changed and rock ’n’ roll gained a foothold. \nSeventy-five percent of the film is comprised of brand new material, Hunton said. Approximately 25 percent was filmed during the past three years for use on “24 Frames.” \nHe added, “One of the things I love about this area is how open and willing people are to share stories about the history of West Texas. A lot of that history comes from talking with musicians.” \nHunton would say later, “I don’t think everything we learned is new. Rather, I would say that we unearthed material that people have not thought about for a long time. When you grow up with this music, you tend to forget just how special it was. \n“Maybe some history had been forgotten, or maybe it was underappreciated. What we did was shine it up, brighten it up so people can see how special it was.” \nHunton finds Terry Allen underappreciated, saying, “Rolling Stone (magazine) called Terry’s “Lubbock (on everything)” one of the most important albums of the 1970s, and he made that album right here in Lubbock. He influenced an entire genre. \n“For an outsider like me, that’s an incredible story. I’m not saying people here took it for granted. But I’m not sure they realized the specialness of it.” \nHunton also feels the story of local band The Nelsons, formed by John Sprott, “is gigantic in scope and relevance.” \nThe Nelsons won an MTV Basement Tapes competition — back when MTV aired primarily music videos — and the band became one of approximately 90 invited to perform at Farm Aid II in 1986 at Manor Downs outside Austin. \n“That story is fascinating,” said Hunton, “That’s Sprott playing guitar in front of 80,000 people.” (Most accounts estimated attendance in 1986 at between 45,000 and 50,000, but the point is made.) \nSprott continues to play in Lubbock. Hunton recognizes that he is “beloved. But in Lubbock, he’s a great guitar player. When he played with the Nelsons, he was a worldwide rock ’n’ roll star.” \nThe Maines Brothers Band continues to be a great story, explained the filmmaker, and “not just because first brothers, and then sons of brothers, worked hard by day and played great music at night.” \nHe feels Kenny, Lloyd, Steve and Donnie Maines provide an “example of the kindness and generosity of people in Lubbock.” \nPicking and choosing topics for “Flat Land and Open Skies” never was easy. \n“A great documentary called ‘Lubbock Lights’ already dealt with the Flatlanders,” said Hunton. “We wanted to use them, but felt that story has been done before. It was hard leaving out D.G. Flewellyn, and difficult to not include Junior Vasquez. There are a lot more stories to be told.” \nHe took advantage of access to Allen and Mac Davis. Plus, he found footage from the last Thrift Store Cowboys performance in Lubbock, not to mention vintage footage of the Maines Brothers Band performing at a Kerrville Folk Festival in the 1980s. \n“I hope what people take away from this film,” noted Hunton, “is just how special Lubbock music is. \n“... And I hope today’s Lubbock musicians know they are standing on the shoulders of giants. And if they work just as hard, they can achieve just as much.” \nwilliam.kerns@lubbockonline.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T08:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:09:30.731+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
