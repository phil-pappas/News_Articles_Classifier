To put that in comparison, the final of the BBC show had around three million more UK viewers than saw Australia put paid to England’s Rugby World Cup dreams or vote for the winning party, the Conservatives, at the last UK election. \nNo wonder then that British Prime Minister David Cameron jumped on the Bake Off bandwagon saying last week that he loved the show and wanted Mrs Hussain to win because “she is so cool under pressure”. \nEven the British Finance Minister, George Osborne, got in on the act, tweeting his support for the 4ft 11” cake baker from Leeds in northern England. Go Nadiya!! A brilliant Great British Bake Off final — George Osborne (@George_Osborne) October 7, 2015 \nFrom early on in the series Mrs Hussain stood out on the show which, with its setting in a garden marquee and with its conveyor belt of Victoria sponges and strawberry shortcakes, is seen as British as, well, tea and cake. \nHer sense of humour, myriad of facial expressions, obvious journey of self-discovery and, of course, her talent at creating fizzy pop cheesecakes and eclair mountains in the shape nuns, have all been noted.

She is what we might define as ‘quintessentially British’. Deeply humble — tick. Self-deprecating — tick. Unintentionally funny — tick.” \nNot everyone was as effusive. Mrs Hussain’s victory, “does not represent a watershed in British race or religious relations” or make any contribution to immigration debate, said the Telegraph ’s Kulei Hartley-Brown. \n“It was just a baking contest and she’s the woman who won.” \nMrs Hussain has, herself, has been acutely aware that her appearance and religion might be confronting for some. \nTalking to the Radio Times , she said: “I was a bit nervous that people would look at me, a Muslim in a headscarf, and wonder if I could bake. \n“I hope that week by week people have realised that I can bake — and just because I’m not a stereotypical British person, it doesn’t mean that I am not into bunting, cake and tea. I’m just as British as anyone else.” \nOne of the Mr Hussain’s biggest fans has been her husband Abdal, a technical manger, who has been tweeting his support throughout the series. I am the proudest husband on the planet tonight. Maybe now you can believe in yourself Nadiya like I believe in you! #gbbo #BegumNadiya — Abdal Hussain (@AbdalAbuMDM) September 2, 2015 \n“I am never going to put boundaries on myself ever again,” Mrs Hussain said clutching her prize of a crystal cake stand, “I’m never going to say ‘maybe’, I’m never going to say ‘I don’t think I can’. I can and I will.” To the amazing people who gave me this opportunity. To my gorgeous baker friends. What a ride .
