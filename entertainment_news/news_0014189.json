She writes: \"Do you know or can find out if Petit was the one who walked across the Mississippi River for the '84 World's Fair? ... I think it was him. I was there to see it but think the photos were (lost) in Katrina!\"\nThe short answer to your question is no, V.M., Philippe Petit did not traverse the Mississippi River on a cable strung over it in the early 1980s. That's because no one did.\nOh, there was an attempt, all right. It took place in 1983, as part of a pomp-and-circumstance-filled kickoff to a \"One Year to Go\" celebration counting down to the opening of the 1984 World's Fair in New Orleans (formally the 1984 Louisiana World's Exposition), and it wasn't some timid affair. Church bells rang. Balloons were liberated. Fireworks exploded overheard, sharing the skyline with F-4C Phantom jets buzzing the riverfront and a huge digital clock counting down to the fair's opening, according to a story published at the time in The Times-Picayune / The States-Item.\nThe headline attraction, though, was that wirewalk, which would have set a world record as the longest tightrope walk over water. The daredevil in question, however -- Canada's Jay Cochrane, not Petit -- never made it to the other side.\nOn the other hand, he sure made headlines -- and not just on the front pages of New Orleans' newspapers, but around the country.\nAs excited as the city was about it, the whole stunt was apparently doomed to failure, with signs of trouble cropping up even before it began. Turns out, the logistics can be tricky when it comes to raising a 13,000-pound, 2,670-foot long metal cable over one of the world's busiest rivers.\nThat didn't dissuade crews from trying anyway, as they set out to position Cochrane's cable, measuring an inch and a half in diameter, over the river on May 12, 1983 -- the day before the performance was scheduled to take place.\nFor hours, they succeeded only in blocking river traffic. After being towed across the river by a tugboat and then slung atop cranes set up on each bank, the cable was supposed to be stretched taut some 170 feet above the surface of the river. It stubbornly refused to budge higher than the 80-foot mark, however, cutting off shipping lanes.\nToronto aerialist Jay Cochrane, in a publicity photo during an unidentified event. Cochrane planned to walk across the Mississippi River as part of the Louisiana World's Fair's 'One Year to Go' celebration, Thursday, May 12, 1983. He never made it to the other side, after an unsteady wire prompted a Coast Guard rescue of him. (The Times-Picayune staff archive) Nobody could figure out why. Numbers were re-crunched. Heads were scratched. And river traffic stacked up, waiting to pass for a total of eight hours, as river pilots fumed.\n\"We've had tie-ups for bad weather and ship fires and fog before. But for a tightrope? No, sir. Never,\" Crescent River Port Pilots Association spokesman Rudy Logrande told The Times-Picayune / States-Item reporter Bridget O'Brien for a front-page story in the next morning's editions.\nAfter hours of no movement from the cable, four bulldozers were used to reposition one of the cranes supporting it. It was a low-tech solution, but it was all that was needed to get the cable to the correct height -- and with just one minute to spare before a U.S. Coast Guard deadline that would have forced the scrapping of the whole stunt.\nThe inspired headline: \"Cable goes up under the wire.\"\nThe next morning, things seemed normal enough for the thousands of onlookers gathered along the riverfront to witness what they hoped would be history. Some 170 feet above the river, however, things weren't so calm.\nWorking without a net, and wearing enough sequins to make a Carnival queen blush, the 42-year-old Cochrane slid his slippered feet out onto the cable shortly after 10 a.m. Clutched in his hands: a specially designed carbon-steel balance pole measuring 48 feet long and weighing more than 70 pounds. It was twice as long and twice as heavy as the pole to which he was accustomed, but a singular stunt apparently deserves a singular balance pole.\nIt wasn't long before Cochrane realized things wouldn't be going according to plan.\nWith his cable unsupported by guy wires -- which would have anchored the cable to the ground at 45-degree angles every 25 feet or so, reducing any swaying and twisting -- the tightrope began moving beneath his feet. In retrospect, wirewalking experts would call Cochrane's stunt foolish. \"I wouldn't walk 12 feet above the ground without sway guides,\" aerialist Jenney Wallenda, a member of the famed Flying Wallendas family, told the paper after Cochrane's attempted river crossing.\nBut Cochrane soldiered on, knuckling down and hoping to get past the midway point, where he calculated the wire movement would begin decreasing. From down on the ground, he appeared to be doing just fine -- to the untrained eye, anyway.\nTo former swaypole dancer Lexie Bruno, who worked in the same circus with Cochrane, there were clear signs of problems. \"He's in trouble,\" she told a reporter when she saw Cochrane's balance pole wobbling noticeably. \"Any time you see a balance pole gyrate that much, you know there's trouble because you never move it except to balance yourself. When you have to move it like that, you're in trouble.\"\nBruno was right. Before things could get any better for Cochrane, they got worse. About 1,000 feet into his walk, and with 1,670 feet to go, the cable begin turning, rolling like a steel log under his feet. The continued wobbling of his balance pole only made matters worse.\nFinally, at 10:37 a.m. and with the wind gusting, Cochrane decided it was too dangerous. He ditched his balance pole into the river and dropped to a straddling position on the wire, hanging on for dear life. Using a two-way radio, he made but a simple request to his ground crew: \"I said, 'Get me down off this, please,'\" Cochrane recalled at a post-event press conference.\nA disconsolate Jay Cochrane sits on the bow of the Coast Guard boat that rescued him from a tightrope over the Mississippi River in New Orleans on Thursday, May 12, 1983. Cochrane tried to walk 2, 670 feet across the river as a stunt to promote the one-year countdown to the opening of the 1984 World's Fair but lost his balance pole and had to be lowered to safety. (G. Andrew Boyd/The Times-Picayune staff archive) As he dangled, crews slowly lowered the cable until part of it touched the water. Cochrane then slid and shimmied his way toward a waiting Coast Guard cutter, which ferried him to shore. Embarrassed, he pushed past reporters -- reportedly knocking a WDSU cameraman to the ground -- and put off any questions until a press conference scheduled for later in the day at Spanish Plaza.\n\"I kept thinking, 'God, you know if I get down and I don't finish this thing, all those people are going to laugh at me,\" Cochrane said in describing what as going through his mind while on the wire.\nIt wasn't long before his fears were proven correct. Cochrane quickly went from daredevil to punch line. \"Aerialist Jay Cochrane failed in his attempt to cross the Mississippi River because he ran into an unexpected problem -- the highwire went haywire,\" wrote James Haddican in his \"Picayunes\" column, a collection of bon mots that ran on the editorial page.\n\"(He) just couldn't get his act together,\" Haddican continued. \"He was trying to do the two-step while the cable was doing the twist.\"\nIt was easy to see why Cochrane was distraught. His aborted river crossing would stand as a decidedly ignominious chapter in an otherwise impressive career as the so-called \"Prince of the Air.\"\nAfter learning to walk a tightrope at age 8, he had run away with the circus when he was just 14. In the years that followed, he would complete a number of successful stunts, including living for 21 days on a highwire above San Juan, Puerto Rico; walking for 53 minutes above China's Yangtze River; traversing a cable stretched between the towers of Las Vegas' Flamingo hotel; and walking a wire stretched between two resorts at Niagara Falls.\nHis website lists a series of world records he set during his career. There is no mention of the doomed Mississippi crossing.\nIn fall 2013, Cochrane died at age 69 of pancreatic cancer. In an obituary that ran in the Los Angeles Times , fellow aerialist Nik Wallenda called him \"a man of amazing visions.\"\nThat's something that isn't often said about organizers of the World's Fair that Cochrane had been hired to publicize. In fact, in retrospect his botched stunt ended up being something of an omen. With attendance far lower than expected, the fair would be saddled with deep financial difficulties, culminating in organizers declaring bankruptcy even before it was over.\nTo this day, it remains the last World's Fair ever held in the United States.", "external_links": ["http://www.jaycochrane.com/world-records", "http://articles.latimes.com/2013/nov/04/local/la-me-jay-cochrane-20131105"], "published": "2015-10-08T15:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:15:11.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
