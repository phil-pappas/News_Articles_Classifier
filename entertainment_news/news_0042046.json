He said his wedding ring got caught when he tried to break his fall after tripping on a rug. \nFallon had received a humor award from the Harvard Lampoon in Boston earlier Saturday. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T22:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:07:00.492+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
