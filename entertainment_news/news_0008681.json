The song made its way to the White House and caused outrage within the Iranian Government, banning Salami from ever returning to his native country again.\nFarzam Salami has birthed a new sound that will revolutionize all genres of music. From Classical, R&B, Hip Hop, Gospel, Pop and even Country, Farzam is one of the most diverse and gifted musicians of our times. Until recently, there was little interest in America in regards to the use of Iranian instruments in musical production, until a sudden flurry of inquiries from known musical artists begin to come in. As a multi-instrumentalist who plays more than 32 instruments, Salami is excited about the opportunity to share his knowledge and gifts with industry, some of whom will attend the concert.\n\"Music is the pure manifestation of the truth, and through my music I talk about peace and humility. It's an absolute mixture of two different cultures that meet in a calm musical place. I call it truth told through music. On this musical journey I would love to collaborate with artists like Jay Z, Beyonce, Madonna, Kanye West , Pharrel, Hans Zimmer , Yani and Keyhan Kalhor ,\" says Salami.\nAt the concert, Farzam will introduce a multiplicity of unique sounds and compositions created by a complex fusion of musical instruments from Iran with those of North American, producing an explosive new sound. Joining him in concert will be high octave songbird/recording artist Kadesh (aka Desiree Coleman Jackson ), wife of NBA sports analyst Mark Jackson . She too will showcase a new brand of music.\n\"Being both a performer and composer for the past 25 years, and collaborating with many great master musicians and virtuosos, I find Farzam Salami to be an extraordinary talent! I foresee a bright future in his musical career and a high potential to be recognized worldwide,\" says internationally acclaimed musician, Pejman Hadadi .\n\"Farzam Salami has brought a new sound to America's pop culture. A captivating sound of hot beats played on 'Tombak' drum mixed with the ancient sound of 'Tar,' beautifully accompanied by his classic versatile style of piano. I am thrilled to be part of this historical event of an Iranian star crossing cultures here in America,\" says Kadesh.\nMORE ABOUT FARZAM SALAMI\nFarzam Salami was a well accomplished and sought after bestselling composer/musician in Iran for much of his life.
