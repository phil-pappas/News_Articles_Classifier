The 50-year-old actor/comedian reportedly is in \"serious talks\" to host the 2016 telecast. A spokesman for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences declined to comment on the matter. Meanwhile, according to Deadline, \"there are some issues to be resolved after about a week's worth of negotiations, but a deal is expected to happen in the next couple of days.\" Rock, in fact, is no stranger to hosting the Oscars. He previously hosted the show back in 2005, which has become the second-most-viewed Academy Awards ceremony of the past 10 years. The fact that he is a former colleague of the new Oscar co-producer Reginald Hudlin makes it possible for Rock to seal a deal for the hosting duty one more time. The 2016 Oscars, which will be the 88th, is scheduled to air on February 28 live from the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More 2016 Academy Awards News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:41:42.464+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
