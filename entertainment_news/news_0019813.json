What happens will change their lives forever. \nThe Road to Glory is a new play by Neil Duffield, commissioned as part of The Berry Theatre’s Road to Agincourt project and forming part of the venue’s specialism in new writing. \nThe cast is made up of local young actors from across Hampshire. \nIt combines both fact and fantasy in a fast-paced, physical production that’s takes us from rural England to the bloodshed of the battle of Agincourt itself. \nThe Berry Theatre presents The Road to Glory on October 30 and 31. And on October 31, playwright Neil Duffield will discuss his career and the process of writing the play with its director Daniel Hill. \nThis will also be an opportunity to ask questions in an open discussion with the writer himself. \nNeil Duffield has written more than 50 plays and adaptations, which have been staged extensively throughout Britain and abroad. Share article \nIn 2006, his play The Lost Warrior won the Arts Council England Children’s Award ‘for work which displays excellence, inspiration and innovation in children’s theatre ’. \nCall 023 8065 2333 or visit theberrytheatre.co.uk.
