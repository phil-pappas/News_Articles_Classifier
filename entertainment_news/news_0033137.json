In Norway, you braved subzero temperatures overnight to make sure you were among the first to see the film,\" the company said. \"Fortunately, there are still plenty of tickets to be had for opening weekend and beyond.\" \nThe response around the trailer caused ticket seller sites like Fandango and MovieTickets.com to crash on Monday night. \nWith 56 days to go until the film's December 18 premiere, the excitement around the film should continue to grow. \n\"The Force. It's calling to you,\" the company added. \"We can't wait for you to let it in, again, this December.\" \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource . All rights reserved.
