Randy Taraborrelli claims. \nBeyonce Knowles secretly separated for a year from her husband Jay-Z in the wake of rumors he's cheating with Rihanna , according to an unauthorized biography \"Becoming Beyonce: The Untold Story\". The author of the biography, J. Randy Taraborrelli, claimed that Queen Bey was incredibly hurt by the cheating allegations. \"Beyonce didn't know what to make of this, and it actually ended up breaking them up for a time,\" the author wrote in the biography. \"They spent maybe a year apart from each other because Beyonce just wasn't sure of what to make of the situation with Rihanna.\" Jay-Z even allegedly wanted to go to the 2014 Met Gala after-party hosted by Rihanna. It explained why Beyonce's sister Solange Knowles had a fight with him in elevator at Met Gala. \"It was a whispered married couple's argument that would have gone by completely unnoticed had not Solange overheard it... Solange has always been Beyonce's biggest protector,\" read the biography. However, Taraborrelli wasn't completely sure about the elevator incident as saying, \"I think it's safe to say the only people who know for sure what happened are Bey, Jay, Solange and the bodyguard who were in the elevator.\" He also said of Beyonce's relationship with Rihanna, \"It's safe to say that Rihanna and Beyonce are friends.\" In the biography, Taraborrelli also addressed how protective the \"Run the World\" singer is to her daughter Blue Ivy. \"She's really a control freak, let's be honest,\" he told ET Online about the book's claims that nannies had to sign a contract including stipulations like not allowing the 3-year-old girl to fall asleep to music. \"So if you're a nanny coming into her household you have to adhere to this.\" According to Amazon, \"Becoming Beyonce: The Untold Story\" is \"the first comprehensive biography ever published about America's favorite living pop icon, Beyonce.\" It is set to be released on October 27. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:44:29.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
