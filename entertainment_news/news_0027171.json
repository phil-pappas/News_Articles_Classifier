I have a lot of outlets for my musicality, and not all of them have to do with jazz. It’s just nice to be a musician, be someone who’s been through a lot, be an artist, and also be a survivor.” Hersch has earned the title. He’s one of the best known pianists of his generation and a lion in the jazz world, and has played with – and mentored – a who’s who of industry names. About seven years ago, Hersch developed dementia related to AIDS and was comatose for a time, unable to swallow and severely limited in motor function. A year later, in 2009, he finally regained full use of his hands and legs and returned to music. Hersch will perform a free solo recital at New England Conservatory’s Jordan Hall on Thursday, October 29. It marks not only his 60th birthday but also the 40th anniversary of his arrival at the conservatory as a student. He has a new album to celebrate, a collection called “Solo,” as well as the world premiere of a song cycle called “Rooms of Light,” and a forthcoming memoir, tentatively titled Good Things Happen Slowly. Hersch is on record describing “Solo,” which is his 10th recording in the format, as his best all-around solo album – and it’s a deeply gratifying listen. Recorded in the Catskills during the 2014 Windham Chamber Music Festival, it’s as good a showcase of what Hersch is all about as any other, applying his supreme improvisational gifts and inventive style to tunes by Thelonious Monk, Duke Ellington, Antonio Carlos Jobim, Jerome Kerr and Joni Mitchell, along with Hersch originals. Hersch had gone into the studio this past January in hopes of making a solo album, but turned to the Windham set seeking fresh inspiration. “I got a good album from those sessions, but all that stopping and starting, I just wasn’t really in the zone,” he said. “About 10 days later I was in the car and I put on this set from Windham. I had listened to it before and knew it was really strong but was hesitant to put it out because I was thinking I should have a CD of all new material. But then I remembered things like how many version of Green Dolphin Street or Autumn Leaves that Miles Davis put out, and he managed to get something different from all of them. This is my 60th birthday – I want my best playing out there. And as I’ve gotten older and gone through all those experiences, my playing has gotten deeper and more patient.” Added Hersch, “I felt like I really connected in each piece. I’m definitely a two-handed player and my left hand was working particularly well that night. It was one of those nights where you feel connected to your material, your audiences, the acoustics are right, and it’s just magic.” Hersch’s recital at Jordan Hall will be a bittersweet affair. After 35 years, with a few breaks, teaching at the conservatory, Hersch is ending his current role with the school and will focus on his other pursuits full time. Those include “Rooms of Light,” for which he worked with poet Mary Jo Salter, as well as work with the vocal ensemble Roomful of Teeth, and a wide range of jazz engagements, including performances with his trio, his ninth annual duo invitation series, appearances at the Newport Jazz Festival and Jazz at Lincoln Center, and, yes, his memoir. “I came to New York in the late 70s, which was a really fascinating time to be there, and I was there for some really historical times,” he said. “I came out in the jazz world when that was still a very difficult thing to do. The gay world was a non-stop party until the early 1980s when the blanket of AIDS descended and changed all of us forever. It’s a multi-faceted story – it’s not just another jazz memoir, though I’ll certainly remember playing with so and so and killing at the [Village] Vanguard some nights. It also has a lot of my thoughts on music, and how I arrived at my musical philosophy.” He’ll still perform here, sure, but his departure from the conservatory inevitably means less Fred Hersch in New England. “I have so much respect for my fellow faculty and for the creative orientation of the school,” he said. “I felt like it was time to go, but that doesn’t at all change my love for the institution itself.” Music preview FRED HERSCH At Jordan Hall, New England Conservatory, 290 Huntington Ave., Boston, Thursday, October 29 at 7:30 p.m. Free. fredhersch.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:04:52.494+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
