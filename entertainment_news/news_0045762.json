(Photo: Dan MacMedan, USA TODAY)\n453 CONNECT 42 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Had John Fogerty managed to get every important story into Fortunate Son: My Life, My Music (Little, Brown), \"you'd have 15,000 pages.\" Instead, the memoir, out Oct. 6, runs a little more than 400, covering the singer's childhood, his years as frontman for Creedence Clearwater Revival and the often difficult years that followed the group's acrimonious breakup.\nFogerty, 70, elaborated on some of the book's stories during a recent conversation with USA TODAY.\nThe long history of Creedence-related litigation has not ended. In 1968, the members of the band signed an infamous contract that gave Fantasy Records near-total control over Creedence's songs and recordings. \"From the signing of that contract forward, we were doomed,\" Fogerty says. \"It was like having absorbed radiation.\" The bad blood created led to Fogerty's not performing Creedence songs for several years, as well as an unsuccessful lawsuit against Fogerty, accusing him of plagiarizing his own songs. While the record-label issues have been resolved, the three surviving Creedence members â€” Fogerty, bassist Stu Cook and drummer Doug Clifford -- have active lawsuits against each other over use of the band's name.\nFogerty usually starts writing a song by creating a melody, a habit that might have come from his childhood love of instrumentals. \"I think that might have something to do with it,\" says Fogerty, who writes at length about the favorite instrumentals of his youth, including Bill Doggett's Honky Tonk , Freddie King's Hide Away , Duane Eddy's Three-30 Blues and, most frequently, Ernie Freeman's Lost Dreams . \"Now that I think of it, probably 99% of the instrumentals I loved over the years did have a very strong melody.\"\nThe opening chords of Proud Mary were inspired by Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 in C Minor , but Steve Cropper of Booker T. & the M.G.'s inspired the guitar solo. \"I didn't know all the real chords to Beethoven's Fifth; I never heard the real classical music,\" he says. \"I didn't have the timing until a Stars on 45 record in the '80s; I had the beat backwards.\" As for the guitar solo, \"Cropper was doing that kind of stuff all the time, and I loved what he played. His solos were based on rhythm. He didn't do a lot of single-note things the way a lot of people did.\"\nCreedence Clearwater Revival around 1970: from left, Tom Fogerty, John Fogerty, Stu Cook and Doug Clifford.

Creedence's first hit was a remake of Louisiana rock-and-roller Dale Hawkins' Susie Q , and the group also recorded tunes by the likes of Lead Belly, Little Richard, Wilson Pickett and Screamin' Jay Hawkins. Mitchell's ballad might seem like a choice out of left field, but Fogerty believes his band could have made it work. \"It would have had the rock-and-roll sound to it, something like Proud Mary , perhaps,\" he says. \"I thought it was a beautiful song. No one had done a version quite like that, though the way Judy Collins sang it was angelic.\"\nIn retrospect, maybe he should have allowed Creedence's Woodstock footage to be used in the movie about the 1969 festival. \"I'm gonna say yes,\" says the singer. Creedence played between the Grateful Dead and Janis Joplin, though many people don't know that because Fogerty vetoed the use of the band's performance because \"we weren't really that good. Although my son says some of those guitar solos were incredible. But people weren't reacting to us. Everyone was asleep. We didn't come off in a good light, I didn't think.\"\nHe's not a fan of the Grateful Dead. \"The way the Grateful Dead and bands like that performed just seemed so sleepy,\" Fogerty writes in Fortunate Son . \"In my world I couldn't have my music be as unstructured as that. It makes me uncomfortable.\" He also blames the Dead for putting the Woodstock audience to sleep before Creedence's set. \"I see it as two divergent approaches to making entertainment, let's say,\" he tells USA TODAY.\nHe sometimes wishes Creedence had signed with Arhoolie Records instead of Fantasy Records. A teenaged Fogerty approached San Francisco-based Fantasy on a whim after watching a TV documentary about the label. \"There's many a time I wish we'd walked into Arhoolie Records,\" he says. The label, which specialized in folk and roots music, was based in El Cerrito, Calif., where Fogerty lived at the time. \"They were really in the same position. Chris (Strachwitz, the label's founder) probably would have been more fair.\"\n'Fortunate Son' by John Fogerty (Photo: Little, Brown)\nHe believes in stricter control over gun ownership but also believes an armed citizenry could act as a deterrent to a corrupt government. \"Or any other faction of that government, absolutely,\" he says. \"I grew up with a love of guns, even though we didn't have any.\" In the book, \"I tried to point out what I think are some of the underlying pressures: Somewhere, somebody's making a lot of money on guns. Maybe we should have more intense psychological testing (required before purchasing a gun), but who are we putting in charge of that, the government? As one of my hunting buddies told me years ago, you know they'll screw that up.\"\nHe destroys outtakes of his songs so nobody else can release them. \"From where I'm coming from, an artist works his way toward one presentable version of a song,\" he says. \"I know the collectors want to have three different takes, even when one is clearly better. I don't see any reason for the other two, any more than I want to see a movie with all the wrong things that happened before they got the right take.\"\nHis favorite part of his memoir comes when his wife, Julie, begins contributing sections in her voice. \"I think it's very important that Julie's voice is there,\" he says. \"Most people will think I'm going to tell about my music and those struggles with the band, but the book ends up not being about that, as far as I'm concerned. To me, it ends up being fairly inspiration. The power of love and healing: That's what the story is.\"\n453 CONNECT 42 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1Le5e3D TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Le5e3D&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1749c82cf9197b09fcb114c8e097a7296438d62f/c=110-0-2890-2090&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635796416613336846-d0-Creedence-FOGERTY-ecov-.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6177174bf73115cbfbdc89954e3546f05eba974e/c=0-288-3456-4896&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635796415656420578-JOHN-FOGERTY-John-Fogerty-jy-7814.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635796415656420578-JOHN-FOGERTY-John-Fogerty-jy-7814.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Le5e3D&text=%27Fortunate%20Son%27%20Fogerty%20dishes%20on%20book&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b2e9b23cd767d8a10443c055f0220c24d0200e88/r=266x400/local/-/media/2015/10/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635796415656420578-JOHN-FOGERTY-John-Fogerty-jy-7814.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6d578352b3593f906804d2553b83cfd01e0bd4e3/c=0-253-1836-2701&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/10/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635796421441754748-Fogerty-FORTUNATESON.JPG", "http://usat.ly/1Le5e3D"], "published": "2015-10-05T20:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:02:41.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
