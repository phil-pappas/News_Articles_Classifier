Ku Klux Klan members are appealing to a fler power in New Jersey to recruit members.\nRecruitment pamphlets from the hate group turned up on Lyndhurstâ€™s doorsteps and driveways last weekend.\nThe flyers asked neighbors to \"Join the Klan and Save our Nation,\" and were stashed in clear sandwich bags with rocks to weigh them down, cops said.\nThe pamphlet also included a link to the KKK's White Knights page, and a phone number for the group in North Carolina.\nThe Knight's grand dragon Robert Jones said the neighborhood's Klansmen had a meeting where they decided to send out the recruitment flers. He said they wanted to let white people know they had \"another alternative out there.\"\n\"The blacks have the NAACP. The Jews have the ADL and the JDL and the Southern Poverty Law Center. And whites, they've got no group working for their interest but the KKK,\" he told The Record.\nJIM LO SCALZO/EPA The hate group has tried recruiting through fliers in other places as well, including the Hamptons, Georgia, South Carolina and Florida.
