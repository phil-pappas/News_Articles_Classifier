When I first started going to parties in three-piece suits about eight years ago, people thought, 'Who is this guy in the three-piece suit?' But now it's a normal occurrence, as the suit and tailoring have made a huge comeback. \n''You never want to be at a party underdressed, so I always tend to overdress. Some people think it is cool to turn up to a big event in a T-shirt but I think that is a little disrespectful. If you have been invited somewhere, it is polite to dress well. It will also give you confidence.'' \nDavid - who has modelled for brands including Dolce & Gabbana, Hugo Boss and Marks and Spencer - also claimed he's not the type to spend hours getting ready. \nHe told The Guardian newspaper: ''I know so many people who, when they get ready for an event, spend two days working with their stylist, calling in outfits and having their hair, makeup and everything else done. That makes me laugh. I go the opposite way. The last event I went to, I had 25 minutes to get ready before I was out of the door.''
