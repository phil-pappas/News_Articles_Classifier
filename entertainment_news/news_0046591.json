Because of this, local law enforcement will be on high alert for drivers while intoxicated.\nIncreased patrols are expected this Halloween in Houston, similar to last year’s No-Refusal weekend in Harris County, Corso said, pointing to the fact that Texas law enforcement has been implementing no-refusal initiatives for almost every recent major holiday, including Labor Day earlier this year.\n“Halloween is a holiday celebrated by all age groups and with it falling on a weekend, adults are going to have more of a reason to go out and drink,” Corso said. “Law enforcement knows drinking tends to increase on the weekend, especially when a holiday is included, so they’ll be out in full force this Halloween.”\nA weekend holiday also means a deadlier one. According to MADD, 31 percent of fatal crashes on Saturdays and Sundays are alcohol related, compared to 13 percent during weekdays.\nUnfortunately, Texas has been one of the worst states for drinking and driving. According to The Texas Department of Transportation, a person is either injured or killed by an alcohol-related accident approximately every 20 minutes. That’s more than twice the national average of 52 minutes, according to MADD.\n“Weekend holidays are active times for police when it comes to DWIs and other traffic violations,” Corso said. “If law enforcement initially pulls you over for speeding, but suspects you’re intoxicated, they’ll immediately test you.”\nCorso Law Group is an experienced team of legal professionals who have handled thousands of DUIs in Arizona over a combined 30 years of practicing law.
