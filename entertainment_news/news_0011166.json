The lamp seen in this photo was purchased by my grandmother at an estate sale. It has two light bulbs in the shade, and the base lights up as well. I cannot find any marks to identify the maker. Other than a few cracks in the metal on the shade, it is in very good condition. As far back as I can remember, it was in my grandparents' living room. Thank you for any information you can provide regarding the vintage and insurance value.\nA. You have an electric slag-glass lamp with metal overlay. The lighted base makes your lamp more desirable. It was made around 1920. Even though some were marked, many were not. Collectors prefer those that were marked.\nYour lamp should be insured in the range of $500 to $1,000.\nQ. This mark is on the bottom of a porcelain figurine of a young woman. She stands on a base, is about 9 inches tall and is in mint condition. She is wearing an 18th-century gown trimmed with lace, has an elaborate hairstyle and is holding a basket of flowers.\nI inherited this figurine and know nothing about it. What can you tell me about its age, maker and value?\nA. Scheibe-Alsbach, a porcelain manufacturer, made your figurine. They have made porcelain in Thuringia, Germany, since 1838.\nYour figurine was made around 1972 and would probably be worth $100 to $150.\nQ. I would appreciate knowing the value of my mother's 1920s purple glass dresser set. The pattern is \"Grape and Cable\" and includes a small tray, a larger tray, a hatpin holder and two covered containers. It has been packed away so long I can't remember if there are more pieces.\nA. Your dresser set is an example of purple/amethyst carnival glass. Sets often included a pin tray, a larger jewelry tray, a hatpin holder, a puff box for powder, a hair receiver and two perfume bottles. Carnival glass is pressed glass with an iridescent finish. It was created by American glass factories and inspired by Tiffany glass. Carnival glass was not expensive and often given away at carnivals, thus the name. The purple \"Grape and Cable\" pattern was extremely popular and was made by several companies including Northwood, Fenton and Imperial. Some pieces were marked and others were not.\nYour dresser set would probably be worth $500 to $1,000.\n• Address your questions to Anne McCollam, P.O. Box 247, Notre Dame, IN 46556.
