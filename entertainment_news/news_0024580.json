Wells'\"War of the Worlds.\" Meanwhile, Columbia Broadcasting System made public the transcript of the dramatization, which was aired the night of Oct. 30 and caused thousands of listeners to panic because of the realistic broadcast of an imaginative invasion of men and machines from Mars. (Photo: AP) \nWith \"death rays\" of fire and poison gas, the invaders were attacking New Jersey, killing and burning, as they made their way toward New York City. \nMany anxious listeners, especially those who had tuned in late from the popular Charlie McCarthy program, missed announcements that the broadcast was a dramatization based on a Victorian-era H.G. Wells novel. \nApparently, some people in the local region were swept up in the resulting waves of mass hysteria that urban legend has depicted as springing up that night. <!--iframe--> \n\"Some thought the world was coming to an end, others prepared to flee for their lives and pray,\" stated an article in the next day's Vineland Evening Times. \n\"Local police, newspaper offices and the telephone exchange answered scores of telephone calls last evening from excited residents into whose hearts terror was struck by a fantastic radio broad-cast ...\" reported the Millville Daily Republican. \nAccording to local accounts, at least two alarmed Millville families were preparing to retreat into the marshes at East Point, and a nearby state police officer ordered road patrols to stand by for service in \"stricken\" areas. \nOrson Welles, left, photographed with Mr. H.G. Wells, Nov. 30, 1940.

It was no joke.\" \nJoke or not, the scare would have at least one beneficial effect, surmised Vineland columnist Gordon J. Hart, in that it would stimulate interest in the \"gripping tales\" of H.G. Wells. Local History: Mystery of abducted boy remains unsolved \nIt also proved a catalyst for the career of Orson Welles, who made his major motion picture debut with \"Citizen Kane\" in 1941. \nFirst known as a book, and then an infamous radio broadcast, \"War of the Worlds\" is probably best remembered today for its Hollywood screen adaptations. \nMost notable of these is the 1953 Technicolor spectacle starring Gene Barry and Ann Robinson, and Steven Spielberg's 2005 blockbuster starring Tom Cruise, in which both Barry and Robinson make a cameo appearance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T17:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T02:18:10.835+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
