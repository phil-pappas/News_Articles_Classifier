Posted: Sunday, October 11, 2015 11:15 pm Ellwood City native's husband recognized for Nobel contribution By Louise Carroll For The Ledger EllwoodCityLedger.com | 0 comments \nThe 2015 Nobel Prize in Physics, which will be awarded Tuesday, has an Ellwood City connection -- through marriage. \nPhysicists at the University of California, Irvine played a key role in the experiment recognized with the prize. Leading the team of physicists was Henry Sobel, who is married to Ellwood City native Toni Choff Sobel. \n“Hank and I just celebrated our 50th wedding anniversary in June,\" Toni Sobel said. \nNow it’s time to celebrate something else. \nHenry Sobel is a professor of physics and astronomy at UCI and co-spokesman for the Super-Kamiokande (Super-K) experiment. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm, Sweden, awarded the prize to Takaaki Kajita of Japan and Arthur B. McDonald of Canada for their roles in the experiment and \"the discovery of neutrino oscillations, which shows that neutrinos have mass.\" \n“This year’s Nobel Prize in Physics would not have been possible without the UCI contributions of Professor Henry Sobel and his team,” said Kenneth Janda, dean of the UCI School of Physical Sciences. Sobel’s group handled part of an experiment detector’s operation and analysis. \nToni Choff Sobel was born and raised in Ellwood City, the daughter of Anthony and Sara Choff. She graduated from Lincoln High School in 1960 and later from Thiel College in Greenville, with a major in biology. \n\"We return to Ellwood City routinely to attend my high school reunions, visit with family and renew lifetime friendships,\" she said. \nThe Sobels live in California. They have two daughters and three grandchildren.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:34:33.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
