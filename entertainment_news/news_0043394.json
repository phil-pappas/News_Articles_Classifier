(Paul Sakuma / AP) Tribune wire reports Contact Reporter \nNetflix is raising the price of its Internet video service by $1 in the U.S. and several other countries to help cover its escalating costs for shows such as \"House of Cards\" and other original programming. \nThe new price of $10 per month for Netflix's standard plan won't affect most of the service's existing 42 million U.S. subscribers. \nSubscribers who have been with Netflix since May 2014 will still pay $8 per month under a two-year rate freeze adopted when the company last raised its U.S. prices by $1. Customers who signed up since the last price increase will pay $9 per month until October 2016. \nNetflix Inc. is charging new subscribers more in anticipation of its programming costs rising from $3 billion this year to $5 billion next year. \nAssociated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:38:30.991+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
