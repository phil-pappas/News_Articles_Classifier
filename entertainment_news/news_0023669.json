He also just got a home in Vegas that he was moving to on Tuesday, but never got to even see it in person.” \nHardcore rap collective Three 6 Mafia formed in the early 1990s in Memphis, releasing their first album “Mystic Stylez” in 1995. \nKoopsta Knicca, real name Robert Phillips, recorded his solo album “Da Devil’s Playground” in 1999 before parting with the band. The group went on to achieve mainstream success with its Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2006 for “It’s Hard out Here for a Pimp,” featured in the film “Hustle and Flow.” \nKoopsta Knicca reunited with several band mates in 2013 to form Da Mafia 6ix. \nBandmate Juicy J posted a tribute to the rapper on his Instagram, saying “Koopsta Knicca we made history! You will be missed.” Hundreds of fans added their own tributes on social media.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T05:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:37:34.496+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
