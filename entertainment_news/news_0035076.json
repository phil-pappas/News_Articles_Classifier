Although he well enough to appear the following night, it's a sign that a rest cannot come soon enough for all four, who have crossed the world many times over in efforts to satisfy their global fanbase. \nSimon Cowell has been steering the band since they formed in 2010, but he admits he has no idea what the plan is \n\"They're going to decide what they want to do next,\" said Simon, who had to admit, \"I don't think any of them have got a plan right now.\" \nThis might come as a disappointment to one of them, at least, with Louis Tomlinson admitting freely that he'd like to join the 'X Factor' lineup next year, following his guest stint on the show this weekend. Simon revealed that Louis was feeling \"really, really nervous\" about his debut on the other side of the judging panel. Louis and his bandmates found fame following their appearances on the 2010 series of the talent show, when Nicole Scherzinger came up with the bright idea of putting him together with four other lads who'd all failed to get through on their solo auditions. \nSimon will have his hands full, anyway, over the next couple of months, with his 2014 winner Ben Haenow set to release his album, including a compilation with Kelly Clarkson, AND the highly-anticipated album from Fleur East. Fleur came second to Ben, but arguably stole the entire series with her rendition of Mark Ronson's Uptown Funk. She is also signed to Simon Cowell's label. Close One Direction's Most Controversial Moments of   It might be surprising to recall that Zayn's inclusion in One Direction wasn't actually all that well-received, given that he'd refused to dance at boot camp, walking out rather than finishing his choreographed routine. Even Mary Byrne gave it a jaunty shimmy, Zayn! One Direction and short-lived rivals The Wanted had a long-standing feud, which peaked when Zayn called their lead singer, Max George, \"chlamydia boy\" during a heated Twitter row. Eventually Jay McGuinness stepped in, urging Louis Tomlinson and Zayn to \"stop mentioning us in your gigs\", adding: \"We certainly no longer mention you and it's time to let dead dogs lie.\" Liam was forced to apologise to fans over this photo, which showed him standing on a window ledge, overlooking East London. He tweeted: \"You may have seen a photo of me today taken on top of a building. I regret being there and having the photo taken. \"It was a stupid and irresponsible thing to do. I am sorry...\" Zayn and Louis landed themselves in hot water last year, when a video surfaced online, showing the twosome smoking a dodgy-looking cigarette, while Louis said to the camera: \"So here we are, leaving Peru. Joint lit. Happy days!\" Louis can also be heard joking that “Mary J” - a slang term for marijuana - is “one very very important factor of Zayn’s warm up”. Harry Styles' Twitter followers weren't impressed with this photo, showing him sporting a traditional Native American headdress, with many accusing him of cultural appropriation. He later deleted the picture from his social media accounts. Miley might have provided one of the most outrageous moments in VMAs history back in 2013, but it's often overlooked that she actually left the ceremony early. Hinting on Twitter that something may be afoot, she wrote: \"Leaving the VMAs. No it's not over. I'm no psychic but congrats @onedirection #songofthesummer\" Call her Mystic Meg, because 1D only went and won, didn't they? We're sure it was just a coincidence... A journalist for The Independent noticed that Louis was sporting a t-shirt with the Apple logo on, but emblazoned in rainbow colours, she speculated it might be a mark of solidarity with the company's CEO, who had recently come out. Louis, unfortunately, totally misread the situation, and took it as accusations that he himself was gay, tweeting the journalist directly and writing: \"I am in fact straight... Fucking ridiculous I even have to tweet that shit!\" You know what, Louis? You didn't have to. Zayn Malik found himself on the receiving end of death threats, after tweeting the message #FreePalestine out of the blue to his 13 million followers. Keep in mind this was before Zayn's Twitter page became a haven for, well, every thought that enters his head, as it currently is. Shortly after his fling with Caroline Flack, it was reported that he'd slept with another woman over a decade older him, this time radio DJ Lucy Horobin, who was married at the time. However, an insider later told the Sunday Mirror that Harry \"had no idea she was still married\". They might have been BFFs when they were still in One Direction, but once Zayn was gone from the group, he and Louis fell out spectacularly on Twitter, over music producer Naughty Boy. Zayn publicly told Louis to \"stop bitching\", writing to him publicly: \"Remember when you had a life and stopped making bitchy comments about mine?\" The two were later reported to have made up, but when Zayn fell out with Calvin Harris, Louis was there to make it clear he was on the DJ's side... Niall was at the centre of a controversy, after a video showed him greeting fans at Dublin airport with the unusual salutation of: \"You shower of c**ts.\" Although that sounds bad on paper, Niall did wish the same fans a 'happy birthday' in the video, and later insisted his comments were \"just banter\", tweeting: \"Really sorry if I caused any offence. It was just banter with fans who I think of more as mates. But I understand that it's not a word I should be using at all.\" The intros to 'What Makes You Beautiful', 'Live While We're Young' and 'Best Song Ever' all struck a chord with music fans, for their similarities to other songs. However, Hayley Williams took it a step further when she heard 'Steal My Girl' for the first time, tweeting: \"[The] beginning of that new 1D song couldn't sound any more like the beginning of @newfoundglory's \"its not your fault\" but...\" This behind-the-scenes snap from the 'Steal My Girl' video upset animal rights' activists, who were angered that the group had a chained monkey on the set of their music video. Although a 1D spokesperson was adamant that no animals were harmed, UK-based charity Wild Futures called for the video to be pulled altogether.
