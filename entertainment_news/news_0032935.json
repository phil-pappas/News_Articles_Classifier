Don't play with me, bitch.'\nNow, in a new interview with The New York Times , Minaj has explained why she did what she did when she did. \"I saw [Cyrus] just looking at me, with her face screwed up, and I thought, What the!,\" she said.\nShe added : \"The fact that you feel upset about me speaking on something that affects black women makes me feel like you have some big balls. You’re in videos with black men, and you’re bringing out black women on your stages, but you don’t want to know how black women feel about something that’s so important? Come on, you can’t want the good without the bad. If you want to enjoy our culture and our lifestyle, bond with us, dance with us, have fun with us, twerk with us, rap with us, then you should also want to know what affects us, what is bothering us, what we feel is unfair to us. You shouldn’t not want to know that.’\"\nMORE: Watch: Still confused re Miley and Nicki's VMA spat?
