India', Bollywood's 'Badshah' Shah Rukh Khan sent across a collection of his films to Paulo Coelho to introduce the celebrated author to the world of Hindi films.\n\nShah Rukh Khan. Pic/PTI \nThe author, who has written several books such as 'The Alchemist', 'Brida' and 'Eleven Minutes', was confused over which one to watch first.\n\nPicture courtesy Paulo Coelho's Twitter account \n\"What a Monday morning gift, @iamsrk! Now I need to know where to start,\" Coelho tweeted from Geneva, along with an image.\nIn the photograph, DVDs of Shah Rukh's films like 'Swades', 'Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna', 'Ra. One' and 'Om Shanti Om' can be seen sprawled on the floor.\nThe 49-year-old actor, who has earned epithets like 'King of Romance', also took to the micro-blogging site to ask his fans and followers to help Coelho make the right choice.\n\"Just sent some movies to @paulocoelho. Please tweet him your suggestions which one to watch first,\" SRK posted.\nThis is not the fist time the two noted personalities of different fields exchanged remarks on the social medium. Earlier this year, Coelho praised Shah Rukh's 2010 film 'My Name is Khan', saying it is the best film that he has watched this year.\nHe also expressed his desire to watch more of his film by posting \"@karanjohar @iamsrk Congrats for 'My name is Khan'. I wish we could see more of your movies in Europe. I had to wait 6 yrs to watch this.\"\nAnd Shah Rukh has now fulfilled Coelho's wish.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T11:00:49.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
