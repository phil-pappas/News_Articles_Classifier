When two long-time friends meet to discuss one’s vision for a different economy, the conversation that ensues sets fantasy against reality. The economic problems of society today are then seen more clearly, and we realize the folly of our economic discourse. But as the conversation progresses, the friends start to see that the fantasy isn’t so far out of reach.\n“Capitalism offers the best potential for human flourishing,” Taft says. “While we culturally preach freedom and free markets, we don’t have the rules in place to attain them. We need a different foundation of economic rules if we are to be truly free people, with minimal ties from government.”\nThrough his book, Taft submits his opinion that capitalism can be done better. His conversational presentation approaches this sensitive topic with diplomacy and conviction.
