Even in the recently released Baahubali , she had revealed enough skin to make men feel weak at their knees. \nThat being said, the chassy actress in one of her latest interviews has urged her female fans to understand the difference between dressing on screen and off it, thereby requesting them to dress responsibly in their habitual life. \nAccording to a report, Tamannaah has said that fans might get carried away after seeing their favourite actresses sporting sleazy and revealing outfits on screen, which might in turn make them wear similar dresses in their real life. \nIt's indeed wise and a bold gesture by Tamannaah which shows her concern towards the society. On the movies front, the Veeram girl will be seen in the upcoming Tamil-Telugu bilingual featuring Karthi and Nagarjuna. She will also be essaying her character 'Avantika' in the second part of Baahubali .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:25:50.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
