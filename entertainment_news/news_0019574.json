Haunted House & Haunted Hayride features over 100 ghouls, goblins, witches & strange creatures from the depths of the old Grove. (Photo: Submitted) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nNo holiday exhibits particular tastes like that of Halloween. While some lawns feature welcoming scarecrows dressed in overalls, others have ghastly corpses dragging themselves out of the dirt. \nNot everyone wants to cry in fear, but few would be opposed to giving out an excited shriek. Here’s your guide to finding the best thrills, chills, and bloody spills in the Valley. \nThe Haunted Doom \nWhile some things go bump in the night, The Haunted Doom has formed a reputation for making a bang. A very loud bang courtesy of a civil war cannon. \nIt very nearly lost that bang when the beloved cannon was brought before city council members as a nuisance, and yet, it persevered as the community expressed their delight for the haunted warehouse that would nevertheless keep some up at night with the sounds of screaming visitors. \nFor the past eight years, The Haunted Doom has delighted guests with a delightful assortment of ghastly scenes. \n“It’s a maze of themed rooms,” Rollin George, The Haunted Doom coordinator, explained. “Maybe it’s a psychotic welder, or a clown room, it can be anything.” \nThe horror show has been in the works since early April when Rollin George and his sons Kevin and Conner regularly survey the 3,000 ft space and begin brainstorming on what new nightmares they can incite for the brave guests that decide to enter. \nIn previous years, the house of horrors invited student volunteers from Mount Whitney High School to lend their hands at creating the set pieces, but this year Rollin George decided to switch things up by inviting the students of El Diamante High School instead. \n“The kids don’t know me and the parents don’t know me, so I did an open house for them to walk through the Doom and get a feel for it,” he said. \nHe described seeing the maze with the lights on feeling as though he were a magician who was revealing his secrets, and rightly so. Nevertheless, an appreciation for the horrific creations is well-deserved. \nSome of the most creative animatronics include elements that require no wires at all, one of which being a ghastly corpse that reaches out once visitors step on a concealed water bed. \nEven though the walk through revealed some of those treasured secrets, once the sun set a second walk-through resulted in no less screams and laughs. \n“When kids come running out of the back of the Doom, that’s validation,” George said. “You have these guys trying to be all tough for their girlfriends, and they come out screaming even louder than the girls do.” \nThe screams promise to be even louder this year courtesy of the student volunteers, many of whom are art students. \n“It’s been phenomenal,” George said. “They’ve been building animatronics and creating these tremendous works of art. We’re simply giving them a venue to display it and allow the public to view it.” \nApart from providing a creative outlet for students, The Haunted Doom additionally serves to benefit their education and provide more opportunities for their creativity by donating a portion of all entrance fees to extracurricular activities at El Diamante. \n“Our motivation isn’t to line our pockets,” George said, “It’s for the students who find themselves asking, ‘What is there to do around here?’” \nThe question is fully justified considering that The Haunted Doom is the only fully indoor Halloween attraction between Bakersfield and Fresno. \nFor those anxiously wondering, a dreaded clown room is fully present. \n“It’s the brightest-lit room in the house, and yet it is the worst room in the house,” Rollin explained, his emphasis being that the worst is also the best. “What I appreciate the most is all the artwork. I solicited students who were taggers and said, ‘How about getting paid for your work?” \nThe house itself functions as a place of collaboration, but equal in importance is the fact that the annual event allows those students whose darkest fear is stepping into the spotlight a chance to let their inner circus freak flag fly. \n“If makeup provides anonymity, then they’re able to scare someone who’s bigger or more intimidating,” George said. “We want to give these students memories that they can share as they look back over the years.” \nDetails: The Haunted Doom is open 6:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. Thursday, and 6:30 p.m. - 10 p.m. Friday, and Saturday at 6420 S. Mooney Blvd. \nVossler Farms \nTelling a friend to get lost isn’t very nice, that is, unless you’re offering to join in. \nOver the past 16 years, Vossler Farms in Visalia has annually invited friends and families in Visalia to get lost in their sprawling corn maze and pluck a fresh gourd from their pumpkin patch littered with Halloween decorations and photo opportunities. \nVisits to the patch have practically become a local tradition for residents across Tulare County, and this year promises no less excitement. \nNow, spread across two acres of land, there are roughly 15 different varieties of pumpkins to choose from. On another two acres, there is the corn maze, haunted trail, as well as food vendors on the weekends, a petting zoo and face painting for the children. Vossler Farms also offers train and hay rides. \n“We take a lot of pride in [the pumpkin patch] because it’s a big tradition for a lot of families,” Kirk Vossler said. “There’s a lot of good people here, a lot of good traditions, and this is one of them; we like being a part of that.” \nThe pumpkin patch is open Monday through Saturday, from 10 a.m. to dusk, and Sundays from noon to dusk. Admission is $1 per person, children 4-and-under are free. Admission for the maze is $9 for adults, ages 12 and up; $7 for kids, ages 5-11, and $5 for seniors, ages 55 and up, and for those with current military ID. Ages 4 and under are free. \nFor those who are a bit older and looking for scares, The Haunted Trail is especially a highlight. \nThis year’s theme is “Field of Screams,” and just like Kevin Costner, if Vossler builds it, horror fans will come. Spooky surprises hide around every turn of the maze once night falls with goblins and ghouls waiting to give visitors on the trail a good scream. \nThe Haunted Trail runs on select days throughout October. Admission is $12, and $10 for children 11-and-under. \nInformation: Vossler Farm’s Pumpkin Patch opens daily at 10 a.m. It is located at 26773 S. Mooney Blvd., in Visalia. For more information on hours and prices, visit www.vosslerfarms.com . \nHowl-O-Ween Pet Costume Contest \nAfter a long night of trick-or-treating most kids feel doggone tired, but the pups that they left at home shouldn’t feel gypped out of missing on the long walk. \nThe Valley Oak SPCA accounts for this discrepancy by inviting all pets out for a jaunt at Plaza Park 10 a.m. Saturday in their finest Halloween attire for Howl-O-Ween. \nPrizes are awarded for those best dressed. \nThe first category “Most Likely to Make You Howl” -- in laughter of course -- for the funniest and cutest costume. \nThe second is “Most Likely to Make Your Fur Stand on End” for the spookiest pet in the crowd, a difficult feat to achieve considering how every fluffy face elicits an adoring “daww” of affection. \nLastly are awards for the Dynamic Duo of best dog and human pair, and the Grand Supreme of the judges’ overall favorite. \nThe competition is fierce, but there will hardly be a growl heard as much as a friendly yelp. \nDetails: Howl-O-Ween is 10 a.m. Saturday, Oct. 31, at Plaza Park, 700 S. Plaza St. Visalia. For more information call 651-1111. \nFifth Annual Exeter Trunk-or-Treat \nEveryone is well aware of the tough streets of Exeter. Well, okay, the streets aren’t exactly “tough” but they can be very dark. \nTo provide children with a safe place to gather candy and take part in the fun activities of harvest time, the Faith Tabernacle Church is hosting Trunk-or-Treat 6 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 31, at 515 S. Filbert Road. \nIn previous years, the event has attracted over 2,000 children and adults, so many in fact that the event ran into a candy shortage. \nThis year the city of Exeter is well prepared, and even if candy does run in short supply has provided plenty of activities to keep kids busy including bounce houses, hay rides, R/C car racing, face painting, and a haunted house composed of Exeter Union High School students. \nHowever, in order to insure against the unlikely disaster of a candy shortage, the Exeter Responds organization is asking for sweet donations from the community. All donations are accepted at SaveMart, Exeter Unified School District Office, the Exeter Police Department, Tricia Kirksey Real Estate and Exeter Hobbies, located at 130 E. Maple St. \nDetails: Trunk-or-Treat is 6 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 31, at the Faith Tabernacle Church, 515 S. Filbert Road. For more information contact Lt. Rabena at 804-9661. \nTrunk or Treat at Houston Neighborhood Park \nRemember that scene from “Pulp Fiction” when they open the trunk of their car and then peek into that suitcase? Contrary to popular opinion, that was candy glowing in there. \nKind neighbors are invited to bring their own trunks filled to the brim with candy during Trunk or Treat at Houston Neighborhood Park in Visalia 9 a.m. Saturday, Oct. 31. \nInstead of celebrating all-hallows eve, celebrating early allows a safe and fun opportunity for children to trick-or-treat alongside their fellow community members. All volunteers are welcome to join. \nDead of Night Zombie Run \nIf you want to guzzle down a pile of M&M’s, then you better work up an appetite. The Visalia Parks & Recreation is providing that opportunity by hosting the Dead of Night Zombie Run 6 p.m. Friday, Oct. 30 at the Valley Oaks Golf Course. \nIn partnership with the Central Valley Horror Club, the run offers something a tad bit more morbid. Rather than just run for candy, these athletes will run for their lives as they are chased by brain-hungry zombies over the course of a 2.5 mile trail. \nAll runners are provided with a waist belt with two “life flags” that must be protected at all times while each runner flees from the hoard on their heels. Those who lose both will still finish the race, but only as one of the undead. \nRegistration is $45 for the living and $10 per zombie. All registrants, both live and undead, receive a t-shirt, finisher medal and entry to the post-race party complete with live music and ghoulishly great food provided by the Homicidal Homemaker. \nDetails: To register, visit www.active.com and search “Visalia Zombie” or register in-person at the City of Visalia Parks & Recreation Business Office, 345 N. Jacob St. Registration can be taken during regular office hours, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. \nSpooktacular Seniors \nGrandparents, and great-grandparents for that matter, have seen their own share of Halloweens. After all, they had to walk five miles -- uphill both ways -- to get their candy back in their day. Now you can share in the experience by spending time with fellow Halloween pros during Spooktacular Seniors 11:15 a.m. Friday, Oct. 30 at the Visalia Senior Center. \nThe lunch event invites all to come fully dressed for a day of entertainment, tricks, and a whole lot of treats. \nDetails: Lunch tickets are $4 per person. For more information call 713-4381, or email recreation@visalia.city. \nHobb’s Grove’s Haunted House \nDoes Visalia not offer enough frights for you? Make a trip to Hobb’s Grove’s Haunted House, a hopelessly cursed haunted forest that has attracted guests both near and far. \nMaimed clowns, crawling zombies, and countless other dreadful sights hide within the parlors and corridors of insanity that the grove has assembled. \nAs for the younger adventurers in attendance, they can follow a similar path with the help of their parents by riding along in the haunted hayride. After all, as horror films have taught us, there is safety in numbers, and what’s more comforting than a bed of hay? \nThe last two weekends that Hobb’s Grove’s Haunted House operates are expected to sell out fast, so all potential wanderers are requested to buy their tickets in advance either online by visiting www.thegrovehaunt.com or by visiting Sierra Vista mall in Clovis, Tower T-shirt Factory in Fresno, or at Roller Towne in Visalia. \nLocal Haunting Grounds \nTrue horror doesn’t need a costume. Are you looking for something true to life? Here are some local haunts that may be worth visiting. \nSite of Cinema 1-2-3: True to its name there have not been one, two, but three different children that have been seen roaming and following the visitors of the cinema that once resided behind the Sequoia Mall. \nLittle is known of the two other children, but according to legend, a boy was apparently thrown off the roof of the building and had been seen by others as being tossed off the roof by a shadowy figure years later. As the theater was demolished in 2010, there is reportedly no site for the spectral souls to roam through, but don’t go blaming us if you rent a Quija board, take it to the parking lot for the night, and find yourself requesting an exorcist the next morning. \nHillman Health Clinic in Tulare: The Hillman Community Health Center in Tulare provides access to primary and specialty medical care, but it also might provide access to otherworldly dimensions. \nThe second floor and the basement appear to be the general destinations for ghostly appearances and the elevator apparently opens and closes between the two floors with no one inside. \nIncidents have been reported of shadowy figures moving through walls, heavy footsteps heard in empty hallways, and even a case with a nurse sporting a white cap with a red cross appearing one moment, and then disappearing the very next. \nSome cleaning crews refuse to work beyond 9 p.m. \nThe Haunted Railroad Crossing: It’s never a good idea to stop on the railroad tracks, but it might be an especially good idea never to stop at the crossing where Avenue 271 turns into Santa Fe Ave. \nThe railroad line appears to be abandoned by now, but apparently not by another presence. Several haunting sights have been reported at the site with many claiming that if a car is parked on the tracks the sound of an approaching train can also be heard, as well, we should mention, ghostly images of people approaching the vehicle. \nTo make matters worse, the effort to make the engine turn over appears to take longer, as though the battery itself is being drained by something not of this realm. \nIt’s unclear if any such instances are true, but considering that the crossing occurs after two 90 degree turns within 250 feet of each other, it’s not hard to believe that some had previously met a disastrous dead end, and maybe now they are just making up for it. \nThe Headless Tulare Motorcyclist: What a fun gag. You just tie a rope across a bridge and wait for your motorcyclist friend to come driving along. \nIt’s not so much fun when the rope is tied a bit too high, decapitates said friend, and then leaves him to roam the bridge in a ghostly form for the rest of time. \nThat’s at least the story behind “The Ghost of Bardsley Road” which became a common fable in the 1940’s after a young man apparently crashed into a house and was reported dead without any outward sign of trauma. \nHis only sign of death, according to the legend at least, was that he was scared to death. \nIf you want to hear all about it, listen to Tulare Union High School grad Dane Sturgeon with his song “Ghost of Bardsley Road” off of his album “Wild ‘n’ Tender.” \nThe Legend of Snake Road: Are you up for a drive? Please be slow. Otherwise you might end up as the woman who, according to tales, drove along Snake Road in Sanger and veered off of the path along with her two daughters. \nThere in the Kings River, she and her two daughters drowned, and yet, one of them may still be amongst us. \nIn the past, there have been reports of a woman dressed in white and weeping as she walks down the windy road calling out to her lost children. \nThe chilling scream of the mourning woman is reportedly still heard to this day. \nSome have called her the “River Witch,” but regardless of any title posed upon her, her voice is supposedly still heard nearby the Herndon Bridge and Hwy. 99 late at night. Just try not to follow that siren song, as you may too be swept along with the tide.
