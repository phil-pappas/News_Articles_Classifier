By Jenel Few Public school teachers Melissa McCoy of Jenkins High, Sheila Lamb-Lindblad of Bloomingdale Elementary, Mark Case of Oglethorpe Charter, Angel Harlin of White Bluff Elementary and Amanda Hallman of West Chatham Elementary were named finalists for the 2017 Savannah-Chatham Teacher of the Year Award on Wednesday.\n“I’m proud of you, and I’m proud of the schools you represent,” said Superintendent Thomas Lockamy. “You make our school district successful with the work you do day in and day out.”\nSchool Board President Jolene Byrne told the teachers they make a tremendous impact on the lives of their students.\n“If you are here today you aren’t just a good teacher,” she said. “You are an excellent teacher; you are an incredible teacher.”\nMcCoy is a 10th grade and advanced placement literature teacher. During her nine years as a teacher she has tried to introduce students to books that they can identify with while engaging them in activities. McCoy is successful because of her deep affection for her students.\n“I think of all of them as my kids,” she said. “They make my day better.”\nLamb-Lindblad is a fourth- and fifth-grade gifted resource teacher who also team teaches fourth-grade math. She has been teaching for 30 years.\n“Every day is an adventure,” Lamb-Lindblad said. “I try to tap into their creativity, give them choices and do everything I can to help them be successful and have fun.”\nCase is a computer technology teacher at Oglethorpe Charter School with 13 years of teaching experience. He also coaches soccer and serves as Oglethorpe’s athletic director. He said he works to make a personal connection with his students.\n“I just try to keep it fresh and make it relevant, important and rewarding for them,” Case said. “I love it when they hang on every word.”\nHarlin is a second-grade teacher in her 8th year. She does lots of hands-on activities and engages families by assigning take-home projects and inviting parents in for the presentations. Her primary goal is for all of her students to believe in their academic capabilities.\n“I always loved school and learning,” Harlin said. “I had teachers that inspired me, and I want to do the same.”\nHallman is a fifth-grade math and science teacher who goes to great lengths to motivate her students — from using funny accents to dressing up like “Aunt Sally” to get them to remember that Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally is an acrostic for the order of mathematical operations.\n“I go to extreme lengths,” Hallman said. “I’m always putting on a show so they enjoy learning.”\nThe finalists for district Teacher of the Year are named a year in advance because the district’s selection process is so rigorous and time consuming. Candidates write essays and undergo a series of classroom visits and panel interviews with a committee of educators, community leaders and former teachers of the year. One of the finalists will be named Savannah-Chatham’s District Teacher of the Year at a gala in January, just in time for the state Teacher of the Year competition.\nSusan Catron, executive editor of the Savannah Morning News and savannahnow.com, greeted each of the 55 school-level Teacher of the Year nominees Wednesday during a reception at the Savannah Morning News.\n“It’s important for us to celebrate success in our community, and if there is anyone at the root of success, it’s you guys,” Catron said.\n2017 SCCPSS Teacher of the Year Finalists\nMelissa McCoy of Jenkins High, Sheila Lamb-Lindblad of Bloomingdale Elementary, Mark Case of Oglethorpe Charter, Angel Harlin of White Bluff Elementary and Amanda Hallman of West Chatham Elementary are the finalists for the 2017 Savannah-Chatham Teacher of the Year Award.
