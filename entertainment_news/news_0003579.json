That was how she got through her problems – by laughing. Related content Amy Winehouse family condemn documentary about tragic singer \n“That film, they think Amy died in July 2011 which is true. But it might sound like a cliche, but she comes to work with us every day. That’s what we have got to concentrate.” \nAnd he appeared to confirm rumours that he is planning to put together his own film about Amy’s life. \nHe said: “It is not going to be a revenge attack on Asif Kapadia, we are looking to do something positive and to talk about some of the positive things in Amy’s life – like the foundation, all of Amy’s wonderful friends who were ignored in the film, and the other creative work Amy did. \n“There are so many great things in Amy’s life that were missed in that film. It was a great opportunity that Asif Kapadia had and he didn’t grab it. \n“Everyone had heard that rubbish. Let’s hear something new about Amy, and this is what this is about – creativity and positivity.” \nHe made his comments at the annual Amy Winehouse Foundation Gala, where a string of stars including the singer’s friend and collaborator Mark Ronson and Barbara Windsor were among the guests in attendance. \nThe foundation works to combat drug and alcohol abuse among young people. \nAmy died in 2011 aged just 27 after a long-publicised battle with drink and drugs. \nHeld at The Savoy hotel in central London, the gala included performances and an auction to raise money for the charity. \nSpeaking on the red carpet, Mr Winehouse said: “I hope this is her legacy - obviously her music legacy will look after itself. She was a wonderful singer and a great song writer as well as being a great human being.” \nAnd he told of the “deep friendship” his daughter had with her long-time friend and collaborator Ronson, who has become a patron of the charity. \nMr Winehouse told The Press Association: “Mark Ronson and Amy made musical history – and their relationship was a deep and loving relationship. \n“I don’t know how they ever managed to get any work done because they were just laughing the whole time.” \nAnd he offered an insight into his daughter’s charitable streak, telling how she once found a burglar in her home and offered to make him dinner. \n“A burglar broke into her house and she heard him downstairs,” he said. \n“She went downstairs and he saw it was Amy and he said ‘sorry I didn’t know it was you, if I had known it was your house I wouldn’t have burgled it’. \n“She said ‘well, can I get you something to eat?’ She ended up looking after him.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T09:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:44:06.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
