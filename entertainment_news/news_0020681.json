Posted just a moment ago \nChuck Hodes/FOX (NEW YORK) -- On Wednesday's episode of Empire , special prosecutor Roxanne Ford was on a mission to put Lucious Lyon back in jail for the murder of Cookie's cousin, Bunky. She had the FBI raid Lucious' business -- Empire Records -- along with his home and even Cookie's Lyon Dynasty. Sadly for the prosecutor, the witch hunt turned up empty so instead she brought Cookie in -- thinking she would break. \nAfter days apart from her boys, Cookie did spill the beans. Sadly, it just wasn't the truth. Cookie told Roxanne that Lucious and Bunky got into an argument about Lucious' recent radio deal to buy all the urban music stations. (If you remember from last episode, Lucious bought the stations and hasn't been playing any of Cookie's artists. Oh, Lucious.) The prosecutor was thrilled by the news and told Cookie her investigation would put an end to the deal. \"It's as good as dead,\" she promised Cookie. \nCookie won this round as clearly that's not the reason why Lucious and Bunky got into an altercation and in fact, she just wanted to get her artists radio play. Very genius move, Cookie. \nMeanwhile, her son, Jamal was getting his very first Rolling Stone cover so a photographer stopped by his home to shoot the cover photo. The photog dressed Jamal up in an odd blue gown. Needless to say, Jamal was living up to his album's name, The Artist. \nAcross town, Lucious' eldest son Andre was still trying to get his old job back at Empire as the CFO of the company. Lucious was hesitant because Andre is living with bipolar disorder. But Andre asked his dad that if he could make the prosecutor's investigation go away, could he have his job back. His father agreed. \nSo Andre went and dug up the body of his \"Uncle\" Vernon, whom his wife accidentally killed last season. Andre felt that if he could reveal Vernon, the star witness for the case, was dead, the case would be closed. So after digging up his body, Lucious put the body in the prosecutor's car. Talk about shock value! \nBut why do we feel that just created more problems? Find out next week when Empire returns to Fox at 9 p.m Eastern. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
