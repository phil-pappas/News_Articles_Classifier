It was our moment to make our point by subverting the message using the show itself.” \nThe artists said it was lack of oversight and the use of Arabic script as set dressing that allowed their messages to make it on air without being detected, saying, “The content of what was written on the walls, however, was of no concern. In their eyes, Arabic script is merely a supplementary visual that completes the horror-fantasy of the Middle East, a poster image dehumanizing an entire region to human-less figures in black burkas and moreover, this season, to refugees.” Homeland is racist. pic.twitter.com/vRvOt3viCQ —¿Fluffy White¿¿ (@whiteliquidppr) October 15, 2015 \nIn a statement released Thursday, “Homeland” co-creator and show runner Alex Gansa said of the controversy, “We wish we’d caught these images before they made it to air. However, as ‘Homeland’ always strives to be subversive in its own right and a stimulus for conversation, we can’t help but admire this act of artistic sabotage.” \nSIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter >> \nThis is not “Homeland’s” first brush with controversy, including criticism for comparing the Israeli prime minister to a Taliban leader in the Season 4 finale and accusations that the show’s fourth season unfairly disparaged Pakistan, about which Nadeem Hotiana, press attache for Pakistan’s embassy in Washington, D.C., released a statement saying, “Insinuations that an intelligence agency of Pakistan is complicit in protecting the terrorists at the expense of innocent Pakistani civilians is not only absurd but also an insult to the ultimate sacrifices of the thousands of Pakistani security personnel in the war against terrorism.” \n“Homeland” is currently in its fifth season and will next air Sunday night at 9 p.m. on Showtime. \nFollow me on Twitter at @midwestspitfire .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:41:02.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
