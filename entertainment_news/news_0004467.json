Pic/Santa Banta \nMcCarthy made the announcement during her talk show \"Dirty, Sexy Funny with Jenny McCarthy\" on Wednesday, reports aceshowbiz.com.\nThe star admitted she's disappointed with Playboy's decision to stop publishing nudes next year.\n\"This is the thing I have a problem with. Playboy to me...is a classy magazine...a lot of people really do read it for the articles,\" she declared, noting that Hugh Hefner \"worked hard on trying to find that Girl Next Door.\"\nThe former \"The View\" co-host worked at a Polish grocery store when she first posed for the magazine.\n\"When I did my test shoot there, I had one uni-brow and a giant bush to my knees. And they were like, 'You're in',\" she recalled.\n\"They really captured that innocence of the women... almost like art...there was nothing ever skanky about the photos. I would always pick up the Playboys and think, 'God these women are so beautiful and it's so beautiful',\" she added.\nShe said that the shoots never felt \"embarassing\" or \"gross\".\n\"It kind of breaks my heart that it's the end of that era, that we have to lose what I would consider very classy nudity in a magazine,\" she added.\n\"I would totally be willing to just take it all off one more time - just to say I'll be in the last one.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:26:16.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
