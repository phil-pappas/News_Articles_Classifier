The ( maybe? ) childhood friends certainly share a strong bond, and on primetime dramas, that usually translates into romance. But don't expect Blindspot to drag out a will-they-or-won't-they situation over several seasons. Series creator Martin Gero has promised rapid answers to the show's mysteries - and has delivered, thus far - and we're guessing the potential Weller/Jane relationship will be no exception. \"They have a very deep and powerful emotional connection, and they're both very good-looking people, so you never know,\" Gero told TVGuide.com at Comic-Con earlier this month. Still, should sparks fly between Weller and Jane, or would that be too much of a clich√©? Check out the video above to see what Gero and Stapleton have to say, and share your thoughts on a Weller/Jane romance in the comments!
