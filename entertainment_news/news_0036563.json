With Masterpiece nearing its final shoot schedule and the post-production work on in full swing, his fans have something to look forward to. We recently caught up with the actor for a quick chat. Excerpts from the conversation...\nWe hear Masterpiece has just the songs left to be shot... Barring a couple of days of patchwork shoot, we are done with the talkie portion of the film. We will be heading outside Bengaluru from October 25, for a nearly 10-day schedule for the songs for Masterpiece. We plan to release the film in December. The post-production is happening simultaneously so that we keep our date.\nYou're quite involved in your films from start to finish... I need to be. After all, I am responsible for my audience's money; I will make sure that they are entertained. This is why I always ensure that they are satisfied and the end product is good. Most of the time, they trust me and get into theatres to spend their hard-earned money for a few hours of entertainment. I don't want to lose that credibility.\nDo you harbour plans of directing a film some day? I really don't understand that thing. Direction is a different thing altogether. I am not talented enough for something like that. More so, that is not my cup of tea. As an actor, you need to do certain things, and one is to understand my director. Hence, I spend a lot of time with him. This way, we have a rapport that works for the product.\nBut most actors think their work ends with dubbing... Basically, I am from theatre and this is how we work there. You really don't categorize things as 'This is his job and this is another's job'. We do it together and our whole intention is to entertain people and we make sure everything is right. So everybody takes care of all things. It is not like, 'This is my job and I am done.'", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:04:30.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
