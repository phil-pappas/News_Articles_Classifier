It's the subject of the popular podcast, \"Welcome to Night Vale,\" which began streaming in 2012. The podcast is set up as a radio news program, with host Cecil Palmer, played by Cecil Baldwin, telling listeners about the happenings in the strange town.Now, a live version of the podcast will come to The Paramount Theatre in Denver in early November.The fictional radio host describes the live show as a form of \"the model of an old-fashioned radio show.\"It brings Night Vale to life, a town of bizarre and strange happenings, such as the appearance of a mysterious glowing cloud, or a cat just hovering in men's room of the radio station.And there's the episode where authorities are tracking a five-headed dragon wanted for insurance fraud.There will be a live band, as well as background music played during the performance.\"Actors come out wearing normal clothes,\" he said. \"We kind of create the story live in front of the audiences. It's a very effective way to tour, without a big set. It allows the listeners to still build the world Night Vale in their own heads. We're not doing all the work for them.\"Baldwin said he originally got involved with the podcast while working in a theater company in New York. He was in a company with Jeffrey Cranor, who went on to co-create the podcast with Joseph Fink.\"(Fink) happened to see me in a show quite frequently and had an idea for a fictional radio show,\" Baldwin said. \"He told me I had a great radio voice.\"Baldwin agreed to help the two with the show, and three years, nearly 80 episodes and one book later, \"Night Vale\" shows no signs of stopping. Baldwin said he was blown away by its popularity.\"It hit at a good time when nerd culture is on the rise,\" Baldwin said. \"We kind of fit into that a little bit.\"He said the bi-monthly podcast became a hit because it doesn't pull any punches with its view on life and \"underlying theme of life is terrifying and horrible.\"\"The podcast is kind of dark often,\" he said. \"I think that resonates with a lot of people. There's characters that come and go. People are killed. Something new and horrifying happens.\"However, just because odd things are happening in the desert town, doesn't mean Baldwin is always privy to what's going on inside the writers' heads, saying that can happen when performing an ongoing story like \"Night Vale.\" He said when performing as Cecil Palmer, he tries to react as honestly as he can.\"When you're performing on the radio, it's almost like playing Shakespeare,\" he said.
