Every haunted house at CMC is different, with changing scenes and characters. This year, there wasn't enough time to develop a brand new haunt from scratch.\n\"We love doing it and we're feeling really bad not to do it this year for the town,\" Taylor said. \"We hire police officers to help us and everything. This year, parents felt they would be way too stressed to pack it all in a short time.\"\nHaunted house preparation usually takes four to six months at the studio. This year would have been the 14th annual haunted house.\nTaylor said not to worry, though, because the popular haunt will return next year \"bigger and better than ever\" in the newly-renovated space.\nCMC Dance Company is located at 6092 Route 31, Cicero. Taylor's husband, David, owns the property.\nFind another haunt: 56 spooky places to visit in Upstate NY\nKatrina Tulloch writes features and entertainment stories for Syracuse.com and The Post-Standard.
