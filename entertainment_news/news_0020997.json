More than 20 were wounded.\nBenghazi has become one front in Libya's multi-sided war, with General Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army forces fighting an alliance of Islamist fighters and former anti-Gaddafi rebels.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T16:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T19:29:31.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
