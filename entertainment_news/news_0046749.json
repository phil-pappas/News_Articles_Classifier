These new apps are being developed and deployed for popular, syndicated radio personalities and programs as a way to better engage listeners and monetize their mobile audience.\nThe Clip Interactive personality apps provide an exclusive channel tied directly to specific syndicated shows. Anything over broadcast and streaming radio now has a digital asset tied to it, with which users can engage. Making the audio content of their program fully interactive allows radio personalities to increase the effectiveness of their promotions and sell advertising at premium rates. The app also serves as a portal to all the show’s affiliate stations so users can listen to and engage with other programming from stations carrying their favorite shows.\n“From Wolfman Jack to Howard Stern, popular personalities have always been an important part of the radio experience. Listeners love and trust them just as much as their local station personalities. Developing branded apps for these popular personalities is the next evolutionary step for Clip Interactive to further radio’s reach in today’s on-demand market while also increasing revenue for both radio stations and personalities,” said Bill Freund, chief revenue officer at Clip Interactive.\nClip Interactive expects radio personalities to experience the same benefits and success as its radio station partners who recently reached $10M in new and incremental revenue. In the coming weeks, Clip Interactive will announce the launch of mobile apps for several radio personalities that have already signed up.\nAbout Clip Interactive\nClip Interactive is fundamentally changing the way the world interacts with radio. The company specializes in creative digital solutions that allow radio stations, artists and radio personalities to directly connect with their fans through an interactive digital platform tied to radio.
