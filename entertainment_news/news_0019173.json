In fact, there was a conversation at one point that went: 'Let's film two movies back to back.' I just went: 'You're out of your . . . [expletive] minds.' In the nicest possible way. They're just too big.\" \nHe added that he doesn't care who succeeds him as Bond. \"Good luck to them! All I care about is that if I stop doing these things we've left it in a good place and people pick it up and make it better. Make it better, that's all.\" \nComing soon: Newsday's Entertainment newsletter, for the latest on celebs, TV, more.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:40:46.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
