Imagine a field divided into two, wheat growing on one side and the other side filled with weed. Which side would look more attractive to you? I bet the field full of wheat grains. \nJust like the field, one who doesn’t forgive is like a field full of weed. When seeds are scattered on that part of the field, they either grow and look thin and wither or do not grow at all. Why? Because the environment is not conducive enough for the seed to grow. The weed connotes the fruit of unforgiveness. Unforgiveness sucks up anything good that God has in store for you to live a fruitful and joyous life. When you forgive, you are clearing the weed and the weed in turn nourishes the soil as they decompose; if any seed is planted on that soil, it grows fast. When you forgive, you are doing yourself more favor than harm; you’re relieving yourself of heaviness and rather embracing nimbleness and an easy flow of blessings into your life. \nUnforgiveness makes you feel so empty and unfulfilled inside. God does not want us to live the rest of our lives in unforgiveness of those who have hurt us. It is difficult to forgive but definitely worth it. \nConsider reconciling with that past or situation by forgiving those who have hurt you; forgive yourself in order to enjoy a happier, more fruitful life.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T11:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:34:48.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
