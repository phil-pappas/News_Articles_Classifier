One bit into an apple, thought it was too sweet. He threw it out the window. The second guy bit into a rock. That's it! That's terrible. Not funny,\" Silverman said on \"The Late Show.\" \nNow, we did warn you that these jokes weren't funny enough to make the Bad Kids Jokes page. But it's all about the delivery, right? \nIn all honesty, while the jokes that do make the cut aren't all that laugh-out-loud funny, readers do get to learn some fabulous new spellings of words. Which totally makes it worth it. \nThis video includes Getty Images.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T15:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:18:07.654+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
