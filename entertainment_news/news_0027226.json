Same-sex marriage wasn’t yet legal.\nSo Laurel’s request is put before the Ocean County, N.J., officials, the all-male Freeholders (who include Josh Charles of “The Good Wife”) and is summarily rejected.\nA political battle, one that despite its seriousness has many comical overtones, erupts.\nLaurel’s partner, detective Dane Wells (an excellent Michael Shannon), is initially flabbergasted that she’s a lesbian and hurt that she hadn’t confided in him.\nBut as the going gets rough, Wells steps up as her biggest supporter in a police department that seems shamefully reluctant to support one of its own and includes a closeted homosexual and a loudmouth bigot.\nAfter local news broadcasts the women’s plight, the story quickly expands nationwide, led by the self-described Jewish gay activist Steven Goldstein (a very funny, very broad Steve Carell), who likes nothing more than unloading a bus of demonstrators to disrupt these once-staid Freeholders hearings.\nDirector Peter Sollett wisely keeps the focus on the two very private women at the center of a storm that never should have broken.\nNine months after Laurel’s death, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled same-sex couples have the same rights as heterosexual ones.\nThe film is adapted from Laurel and Stacie’s story as told in Cynthia Wade’s “Freeheld,” which won an Academy Award as best documentary short subject in 2008.\nThis dramatization, scripted by “Philadelphia” scribe Ron Nyswaner, is especially thanks to Moore, a worthy coda.\n(“Freeheld” has an adult relationship and issues as well as language.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:41:24.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
