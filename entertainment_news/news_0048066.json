The movie will be available on the WATCH Disney Channel app, WATCH Disney Junior app, Disney Channel on Demand and Disney Junior on Demand the following day, Monday, November 23. \"The Lion Guard\" television series will premiere in early 2016. Both the movie and series will roll out globally through 2017 on Disney Channels and Disney Junior channels. Set in the African savanna, \"The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar\" introduces Kion, the second-born cub of Simba and Nala, who is destined to become leader of the Lion Guard, a team of animals comprised of the Pride Lands' fiercest, bravest, fastest, strongest and keenest of sight. As Kion looks to assemble the members of the new Lion Guard, he does not call upon a group of lions to serve with him as tradition dictates, but instead chooses some of his friends whom he believes best exemplify these heroic qualities - Bunga, a fearless honey badger; Fuli, a confident cheetah; Beshte, a friendly and good-spirited hippo; and Ono, an intellectual egret. Throughout the movie and subsequent series, the diverse team of young animals will learn how to utilize each of their unique abilities to solve problems and accomplish tasks to protect the Pride Lands and maintain balance within the Circle of Life. The Education and Science experts at Disney's Animal Kingdom theme park serve as consultants, advising on the characteristics, behaviors and habitats of the African animal species featured and inspiring original stories based on their first-hand experiences. Author and Swahili expert Sarah Mirza is the language and cultural advisor.
