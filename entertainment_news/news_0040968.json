Hugh Hefner works on the first issue of Playboy magazine in his Chicago apartment in 1953. Company officials announced this week that as part of a magazine redesign coming next year, Playboy will no longer feature photos of nude women. (Playboy Enterprises) Playboy will drop photos of naked women beginning with March issue \nWhat next? \nThe New Yorker without cartoons? \nIllinois politics without corruption? \nThe world is an increasingly wild and ever-changing place and we understandably become comfortable with — cling fast to — certain things and we expect them to remain. \nBut Playboy without photos of naked women? \nThat was the announcement, that as part of an overall redesign of the magazine to be unveiled in its March issue (available in February), Playboy will no longer feature images of fully nude women in its magazine. The official statement read: \"The magazine will still feature women in provocative poses, but they will no longer bare all.\" \nEven those who haven't seen a copy of the magazine since they graduated from high school were gripped by a certain nostalgia that prompted a collective sigh. (My colleague Phil Rosenthal has all the commercial details and the motivation behind this decision, in Business). (Phil Rosenthal) \nBut, oh, dear — venerable, Chicago-born Playboy without naked women? \nFor a couple of generations of red-blooded men, starting in 1953 with Marilyn Monroe as the cover girl (and naked inside), these photos meant something special and dare we say, something extremely personal. (It's certainly personal to Hugh Hefner. Monroe is buried in a drawer at the mausoleum in Westwood Village Memorial Park in Los Angeles. And some years ago the now 89-year-old Hefner bought the drawer next to hers, to be his final resting place, for eternity.) \nThe magazines were pinched from newsstands and drug store racks by teenage boys, snuck home and buried under mattresses or placed at the bottom of clothes drawers for later, private perusal, pleasure and fantasies. It was not exclusively about naked women, but also a lifestyle. As magazine founder Hefner once told me, \"I wanted to create a men's magazine devoted to subjects I was interested in — the contemporary equivalents of wine, women and song, though not necessarily in that order.\" He offered a new set of ethical values for an urban society and all of its toys. The message was loud and clear: Enjoy yourself. Candace Jordan: Say it ain't so, Hef Open link \nI know that you, or most of you, know what that meant: the cool apartment, the great stereo, the hip clothing and ... to borrow a couple of lines from \"Lolita\" novelist Vladimir Nabokov, Playboy was for many a young fellow, \"Light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.\" \nNabokov wrote for Playboy. So did some of the other great literary names of the last half of the 20th century: John Updike, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, James Baldwin, Margaret Atwood, Norman Mailer, Ray Bradbury ... a list long enough to fill a library with their books. \nYes there were some of us, many of us, who did read Playboy for the articles — OK, also read some of the articles that accompanied the photos. \nPlayboy was also a virtual art gallery. Art Paul, who designed the famous Bunny logo, was the magazine's first employee. Working closely with Hefner (still editor in chief), he designed Playboy's pages and made it a canvas for artists, commissioning the work of famous ones like Salvador Dali and helping nurture (creatively and financially) a new generation that included Andy Warhol, LeRoy Neiman and Brad Holland, along with such Chicagoans as Ed Paschke, Shel Silverstein, Roger Brown and Ellen Lanyon. There were hundreds more. \n\"The magazine is given credit for the sexual revolution,\" says Christie Hefner, daughter of Hugh Hefner, and a former chairman/CEO of the company. \"Art deserves the credit for the illustrator's liberation. He helped redefine the whole notion of commercial art as being able to be as well-regarded and legitimate as high art.\" \nChristie, ever diplomatic and gone from the magazine since 2009, declined to comment on the recent no-nudity news. Paul is a still lively and productive 90 years old and recalls working with Hefner in selecting the nude photos that became centerfolds or were featured in other —\"Girls of the Big Ten\"— spreads. They saw millions of photos and their aim, Paul says, was to try \"to make the girls look more real and less plastic.\" \nThey looked \"real\" enough for most of us. \nPaul left the magazine in 1982, but shared these thoughts Tuesday: \"What will Playboy be without nudes? From the start we had far more content than just nudes. But also our emphasis was never about more, but better. Quality. Innovation. Surprise. In everything. The many awards that came our way were not for the sexy pictorials, but for very innovative illustration of a great amount of first-class reporting, interviews, articles and stories in each issue. And certainly in the early years, there was less nudity, more intimacy: Sex is about more than nudity. We saw our competitors then as more magazines like Esquire, not Penthouse. Come to think of it, there was even, back in the day, a pictorial about a reverse striptease: putting clothes back on. \n\"So these changes sound right to me. And in keeping with what I think Playboy at its best always was. I'm very glad in particular that there will be renewed emphasis on artwork, for magazines today have become all photo, no art. In its early years, and at Playboy magazine's peak, our emphasis was on artwork of high quality. I was credited with leading a revolution in illustration, and certainly from the '50s through the '80s were the golden age of American illustration. There's a documentary in progress on me that emphasizes Playboy's part in this golden age of illustration. And there's also continued interest in Hefner's activism and the broader scope of his efforts at social change. I'm happy to see these aspects of Playboy emphasized, and the revamp of the magazine seems a part of this long-overdue examination of the whole, historical picture of the phenomenon that is Playboy.\" \nThere were those who long railed against the magazine: \"Pornography!\"\"Objectification of women!\" \nThese folks might have had more than a whisper of argument after Playboy hit the newsstands and mailboxes in 1953, and that argument might have echoed for a couple more decades. \nBut really, have you watched TV? Surfed the Internet? \nSex, in forms that make you want to wash your brain out with soap, has been readily available at the click of a few buttons for some time now. What's there for the viewing has long made Playboy seem tame and, dare we say, almost wholesome. \nThe first issues of the magazine sold about 70,000 copies, and it quickly reached a circulation of 1 million and then 2, 3 ... topping out eventually at more than 8 million in the early 1960s, and spawning magazine racks full of imitators. \nIn 1967, a Time magazine cover story noted that, \"Hefner was the first publisher to see that the sky would not fall and mothers would not march if he published bare bosoms; he realized that the old taboos were going. ... He took the old-fashioned, shame-thumbed girlie magazines, stripped off the plain wrapper, added gloss, class and culture. It proved to be a sure-fire formula.\" \nIndeed and now, with most of the \"old taboos\" going, going and gone, Playboy circulation has been on a steady decline, now holding at about 800,000. \nOver the decades, millions of words have been written about Playboy and its appeal, its meaning. \nAmong the most intriguing came from Barbara Ehrenreich in her book \"The Hearts of Men: American Dreams and the Flight from Commitment\": \"(The real message of Playboy) was not eroticism, but escape — literal escape from the bondage of breadwinning.\" \nThe images of naked women, she wrote, \"were necessary not just to sell the magazine, but to protect it. When, in the first issue, Hefner talked about staying in his apartment listening to music and discussing Picasso, there was the Marilyn Monroe centerfold to let you know that there was nothing queer about these urbane and indoor pleasures. And when the articles railed against the responsibilities of marriage, there were the nude torsos to reassure you that the alternative was still within the bounds of heterosexuality. Sex — or Hefner's Pepsi-clean version of it — was there to prove that a playboy didn't have to be a husband to be a man.\" \nCandace Jordan was a Playboy centerfold in the magazine's December 1979 issue — yes, naked and proud of it. Now a contributor to the ChicagoNow.com blog and author of the lively Candid Candace column in the Sunday Tribune, she tells me, \"I am heartbroken and think this is a ridiculous decision.\" Her further thoughts can be read at http://bit.ly/1Ozww5N . \nAnd so, the world will continue to spin and you will always have your memories.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T00:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:10:56.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
