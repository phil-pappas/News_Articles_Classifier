Fox sports 'Back to the Future' shoes on Kimmel show Shoe company selling more Nike MAGs to support Parkinson's research By Frank Pallotta and Kristen Hamill POSTED: 9:38 AM PDT October 21, 2015 UPDATED: 4:02 PM PDT October 21, 2015 From NBCU via CNN NEW YORK (CNNMoney) - \nMichael J. Fox wore a brand new pair of self-lacing \"Back to the Future\" sneakers to the \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" show Wednesday. More From KTVZ.COM Welcome, 'Back to the Future' Day \nHe didn't just show up in the futuristic shoes. \nHe arrived on stage as Marty McFly, a passenger in a DeLorean driven by Christopher Lloyd in full Doc Brown mode. \nThe spectacular arrival was the culmination of Back to the Future Day to mark the date Marty and Doc landed in the 1989 \"Back to the Future II\" film. \nThe possibility of Nike actually marketing the shoes had sneakerheads and \"Back to the Future\" fans full of anticipation. \nNike did produce one pair of the shoe and sent it to Fox Wednesday. \nThe shoe company said it was making additional pairs to be auctioned in 2016 with the money going to support of the Michael J. Fox Foundation. The foundation does research into Parkinson's disease, which Fox was diagnosed with in 1991. \nAn auction of \"Back to the Future\" shoes in 2011 raised $9.4 million. \nWord of the shoe got out when Fox tweeted, \"The letter I received from Tinker today. Thanks @Nike.\" \nTinker appears to be Tinker Hatfield, a Nike shoe designer. \nIn his note, \"Tinker\" writes, \"As the first most celebrated wearer of the Nike Air Mag, we wanted you to be first to receive a 'living pair.'\" \nThe note, which includes a drawing of Fox holding the new sneaker, went on to say, \"In addition to your personal pair we're creating more pairs for support in aid of the Michael J. Fox Foundation.\" \nNike president and CEO Mark Parker said in a statement, \"We started creating something for fiction and we turned it into fact.\" \nIn the film, McFly tries on a pair of grey Nike high-tops, known as \"Nike MAGs,\" that to McFly's surprise self-lace. \n\"Power laces! Alright!\" McFly says in the film. \nNike's tweet had fans exclaiming \"great Scott!\" on social media over the possibility that the shoes are on the way. \nSince the film's 1989 release, the shoes have become a longed-for item for the movie's fans and sneaker enthusiasts. \nThe company patented an \"automatic lacing system\" in 2008. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource .
