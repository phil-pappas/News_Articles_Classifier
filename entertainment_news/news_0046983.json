Murs is single since breaking up with property manager Francesca Thomas. According to “The Xtra Factor” presenter Melvin Odoom, Cowell is playing Cupid, trying to get Murs and Flack together. “Simon wants Olly and Caroline to get together. He’s always trying to make them admit they fancy each other and make things awkward for them,” The Sun quoted Odoom as saying, reports mirror.co.uk. Sharing that the couple has incredible chemistry, Odoom said that the duo has a bond like nobody else. “They have this incredible chemistry. There’s not a presenting duo around that has that kind of bond. They know what the other is thinking and they are always laughing and joking on set but there is that kind of will-they won’t-they tension which they’ve always acknowledged and played with,” he said. Flack has previously admitted that she fancied Murs when he auditioned as a contestant on the show, but according to Murs, working together means they have to keep things strictly friends. \n  3:20 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T00:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T01:38:02.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
