British actress Emilia Clarke has been declared the Sexiest Woman Alive by Esquire magazine, which described her as having that ability to \"play queen and kid sister, dominatrix, and pal.\" Like Us on Facebook \"She manages to bring together a number of opposites, to make them natural: sweetness and toughness, emotionalism with a kind of cold-blooded determination,\" Esquire said in a piece for its November 2015 issue dedicated to the Mother of Dragons. \"Something in these contrasts explains her sex appeal, too\" \"Half pal, half dominatrix. Half kid sister, half sexy queen. The movie star who plays, in her real life, an anonymous, funny beauty. This is the gorgeous balance of Emilia Clarke,\" the publication declared. And that is why she's on top of Esquire's list this year. Last year, Penelope Cruz had that honor. Clarke's cover story had her recounting her experience auditioning for the role that made her a household name, and a woman for men to drool over. \"I had two scenes which told me nothing and not very much time in which to read all those (George R.R. Martin) books,\" she revealed, as noted by CNN . \"So I did what every good actor does and Wikipedia'd the living crap out of it.\" Clarke plays aspiring queen Daenerys Targaryen on HBO's \"Game of Thrones,\" which has gone on to be a monster TV series hit that has also reaped a bucketful of awards along the way. This is not the 28-year-old's first time to be feted as the most alluring among the females in showbiz. She had been declared \"Woman of the Year\" just this year by another men's publication, GQ, and had accepted such an award recently in September. Apparently, her role as the Mother of Dragons and as the younger version of Sarah Connor in \"Terminator Genisys\" earned her the honor. These recognitions may warm the hearts of women who share a similar physique as Clarke. In an industry that has been accused of glorifying supermodel looks, the acknowledgment of Clarke's beauty, even though she is \"short and round and brown,\" could serve to reassure women that curves are indeed beautiful. \"The actress's fans now have the challenge of adding 'Sexiest Woman Alive' to her Thrones character's very long title: 'Daenerys of House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lady Regnant of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons,\" USA Today noted.
