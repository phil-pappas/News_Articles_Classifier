Rashid had claimed that he did not want to offend anyone but wanted to send a message that “no courts or legislature can prevent the people from eating what they want”. Condemning the state government for allegedly facilitating Rashid to organise “beef party” in the MLA Hostel and to deliver highly provocative speeches during the said party, JKNPP Chairman Harsh Dev Singh sought registration of criminal cases against him. Singh also sought immediate arrest of Rashid for what he termed the most heinous offences openly committed by him in a government institution. Activists of Hindu Shiv Sena also held a protest at B C Road area here demanding stern action against the MLA. They also burnt his effigy. The VHP condemned Engineer Rashid for holding the beef party and said Rashid had hurt the sentiments of the Hindu community across the globe. VHP state president Ramakant Dubey demanded immediate arrest of Rashid. Others including Kranti Dal, Shiv Sena Hindustan, Sri Ram Sena, Rastryawadi Shiv Sena and Freedom Fighter Association also denounced the MLA for holding the beef party. \n 10 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:17:25.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
