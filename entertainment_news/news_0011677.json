There is one common thread between the two sides; both started off well, with victories, both had an attacking ethos and followed a good initial burst with losses. ISL 2015: Full Fixture list and match schedule \nThe bad has outweighed the good for both these teams and the problems have been similar too. Their strikers have not scored enough goals and their midfield has shown enough creativity in the final third. FC Goa though, roared back to form against NorthEast United in what was a complete display from Zico’s men. The 0-4 thrashing at the hands of Chennaiyin FC was a big wakeup call, especially for their defense, which was ripped to shreds by Elano and Stiven Mendoza. Also Read: FC Goa Team Profile \nIn Goa’s last game, it looked like they had devised a formula that would work for the side as the tournament heads into the business end. Dropping Brazilian World Cup winner Lucio was a big step and suddenly, the defense had more pace in their ranks and was far more compact and assured. Leo Moura and Reinaldo, two big name players who had underperformed in the tournament so far were back in a big way. Their shooting though, left a lot to be desired. It was the worst that ISL 2015 had seen so far. Against stronger opponents, Goa could have been ruing their misses. Also Read: Kerala Blasters Team Profile \nAfter their emphatic display in the opening game, Kerala have been struggling for form in the following games. Dearth of creativity in midfield and then lack of goals has hurt the side. The only silver lining so far has been Peter Ramage and co’s solidity at the back. Reinaldo is a striker who drifts to the left flank and lets players in the middle take up dangerous positions. He plays off the shoulder of the defenders and will be Kerala’s biggest threat going into the game. Leo Moura, after a poor start is looking good. \nPrediction \nKerala Blasters are struggling for goals. It will be a cagey encounter that will end up in a 1-1 draw or FC Goa shading the game by a solitary goal difference. \nSquads: \nKerala Blasters \nShilton Paul, Stephen Bywater, Sandip Nandy, Ramandeep Singh, Peter Ramage, Carlos Marchena, Sandesh Jhingan, Gurwinder Singh, Bruno Perone, Saumik Dey, Marcus Williams, Rahul Bheke, Cavin Lobo, Joao Coimbra, Ishfaq Ahmed, Shankar Sampingiraj, CK Vineeth, Mehtab Hossain, Antonio German, Peter Carvalho, Pulga, Josue, Chris Dagnall, Sanchez Watt, Manandeep Singh, Mohammed Rafi \nFC Goa \nElinton Andrade, Luis Barreto, Laxmikant Kattimani, Keenan Almeida, Gregory, Nicolau Colaco, Narayan Das, Raju Gaikwad, Lucio, Debabrata Roy, Luciano Sabrosa, Mandar Rao Desai, Devadas, Romeo Fernandes, Pranoy Halder, Jonatan Lucca, Leo Moura, Jofre, Bikramjit Singh, Joaquim Abranches, Daryl Duffy, Victorino Fernandes, Thongkosiem Haokip, Reinaldo, C Sabeeth, Vicor Simoes \nPhoto Courtesy: FC Goa’s Facebook page \n  5:04 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T14:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T15:30:36.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
