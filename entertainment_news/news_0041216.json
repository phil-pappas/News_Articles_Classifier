The Huffington Post UK | By Caroline Frost reddit \n21 October 2015 - just another ordinary day, except it's enshrined in cultural history as the destination for Marty McFly and his eccentric scientist travelling companion Doc Brown in the 'Back to the Future' sequel. \nAs the internet goes into flux capacitations working out what they got wrong and what they got wonderfully right when the filmmakers were trying to predict the future back in 1989, we've found this wonderful clip (above) of co-stars Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd reuniting to see what inventions did survive. And we've discovered that, much to our delight, one of them does indeed still own a fax machine. \nThe day has finally arrived... we've finally caught up with Marty McFly and Doc Brown \nChristopher Lloyd has never really let Doc Brown go, either, playing him in a whole catalogue of video games, voiceovers, whenever he's asked, basically. And he'd most definitely be up for doing it again on screen, although it seems director Robert Zemeckis has some bad news for him, telling Digital Spy recently that a fourth film is most definitely not on the cards. \nAnd Michael J Fox has gone from strength to strength, winning a string of awards - four Golden Globes, five Emmys, even a Grammy for his memoir audiobook - and raising millions of dollars for research into Parkinson's disease through his foundation. \nBut what about the rest? We catch up with the whereabouts of some of the original cast from Robert Zemeckis's ground-shattering trilogy... Dave McFly The McFlys' eldest child, Dave started work at Burger King but later got himself a white-collar job at a local accounting firm. Marc McClure Most famous for this role and for appearing in the 'Superman' films, Marc went on to 'Freaky Friday' in 2003. TV appearances have included 'Once an Eagle', 'Happy Days', 'Hunter', 'The Shield' and 'Cold Case'. Linda McFly The McFlys' middle child, Linda originally had boy trouble but was later seen in a boutique fighting them off. Wendie Jo Sperber Following her appearance in BTTF, Wendie opted to concentrate on TV, starring in series 'Babes' and 'Hearts Afire'. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1997, and died in 2005, with her last role being voicework for 'American Dad!'. Following her diagnosis, she founded weSPARK Cancer Support Center and is the subject of 'The Show Must Go On', which shows her working through her illness. Jennifer Parker, Marty's long-suffering love Claudia Wells Replaced by Elisabeth Shue for the sequels, Claudia... George McFly A man hampered only by terrible clothes and low self-confidence, George was rescued by wingman Marty and finally proved come the hour, come the man... \"You are my density!\" he proudly told his wife-to-be, and thus history was rescued. Crispin Glover Because Crispin didn't opt to appear in the original film's sequels, producers fudged his likeness using disguising shots and another actor. Crispin sued, leading to a permanent change in all actors' contracts. He remains one of the industry's most offbeat characters, appearing as Andy Warhol in 'The Doors' and producing, directing and creating his own music. Most recently, he has been filming 'The Brits Are Coming' alongside Uma Thurman, Tim Roth, Sofia Vergara and Stephen Fry, due for release next year. Lorraine Marty's mum, who got over her wonder at his Calvin Kleins to fall for George and safeguard Marty's destiny. Lea Thompson Since appearing in the trilogy, Lea Thompson has never really stopped working, with film appearances including 'All the Right Moves', 'The Beverly Hillbillies', 'Howard the Duck', 'Jaws 3-D', 'Red Dawn' and 'Some Kind of Wonderful'. She starred as the title character in 1990s TV sitcom 'Caroline in the City'. For the last four years, she has co-starred as Kathryn Kennish in the series 'Switched at Birth'. Biff Tannen The town's resident Romeo and bothering bruiser, made to see the error of his ways by an inflated George McFly. Thomas F Wilson Wilson's biggest role since the 'Back to the Future' trilogy has been that of Coach Ben Fredricks in 'Freaks and Geeks'. He has lent his voice to many an animation series, and appeared in TV series such as 'Bones', 'Boston Legal' and 'House'. He has also created a 'Big Pop Fun' podcast, involving him interviewing showbiz friends. Because he has been asked so often about his role of Biff, Wilson has created a 'Biff's Question Song' which he performs as part of his comedy stand-up routine. Doc Emmett Brown A man whose dreams came true, courtesy of a curious young man, a lightning-struck clocktower and a DeLorean. Christopher Lloyd A longtime actor most famous for this role as well as TV comedy 'Taxi', Lloyd was reunited with Michael J Fox in a 1999 episode of 'Spin City'. He's also appeared in 'Numb3rs', and was a regular in 'Stacked'. As well as frequent theatre roles, Lloyd has reprised his eccentric scientist for multiple voiceovers, animations, commercials and games. It seems Doc Brown is the role he was born to play. He's been married four times, and sadly lost his Californian home in a wildfire in 2008. Marty McFly Was anybody ever more perfectly cast? (Just don't mention Eric Stoltz, the actor originally chosen before Robert Zemeckis changed his mind and recruited Michael J Fox) Michael J Fox Actor, author, producer, activist, Michael J Fox has proved himself many times both on screen and off. A stack of Awards to his name for 'Family Ties' and 'Spin City', he revealed in 1998 that he'd had Parkinson's Disease for the best part of a decade. Since then, he has raised millions of dollars and increased awareness of the illness through his Michael J Fox Foundation, released three volumes of memoir and continues to act. He has lobbied Congress for funds for stem cell research. In 2007, his work led him to be named one of the 100 people \"whose power, talent or moral example is transforming the world\" by Time magazine.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T21:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:54:55.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
