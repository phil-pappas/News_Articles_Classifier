The series' creator Amy Sherman-Palladino had left the show before the final season, and the consensus opinion was that the series' final season suffered mightily in her absence. The announcement that Netflix plans to revive the series offers hope that fans will get what they've been longing for. \nNetflix announced this week that it would produce a limited revival of Gilmore Girls in the form of four 90-minute episodes. Sources say that the series' stars, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel, will return for the revival, as will Scott Patterson and Kelly Bishop. Edward Hermann, who died last year, will of course be written out of the show, and Melissa McCarthy, whose career has skyrocketed since her involvement with the series ended, will almost certainly not return. \nMost significant, though, is the involvement of Sherman-Palladino, who will likely write at least some of the new material. No word yet about a potential release date for the episodes, but production is expected to begin near the start of 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T16:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:52:40.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
