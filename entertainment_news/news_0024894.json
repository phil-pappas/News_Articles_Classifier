North Hunterdon High School and Voorhees High School students access the program by downloading an app or by accessing a mobile-optimized website. Parents will be invited to participate at a later date.\nThe programs, which are known to users as North360 and Voorhees360, are built on Evolution Labs’ H360 and P360 platforms. The platforms enable high schools to offer a highly immersive content experience that can be tailored to individual schools, while drawing on nationally recognized best practices. The programs use an array of content vehicles, including short, expert-written topics, engaging videos, interactive self-tests and curated social media content. Program topics include: recognizing violent relationships, helping parents cope with a bullied (or bullying) child, bystander intervention, stress management, substance abuse, diet, academic honesty, college prep and concussion education for student-athletes.\n“These innovative programs promise to be vehicles that will allow us to provide both students and parents with the right content at the right time throughout the school year,” said Ron Peterson, Principal, Voorhees High School. “Web and social media have brought their share of challenges to high school students. Programs like North360 and Voorhees360 provide an opportunity for us to tap into the power of digital media with a positive message,” said Rich Bergacs, Principal, North Hunterdon High School.\nThe platforms deliver new topics throughout the year, via email, SMS and in-app messaging. Each month, students must also complete a required topic, including a pre- and post- assessment to determine the extent to which they’ve absorbed the subject matter.\n“North Hunterdon-Voorhees is a pioneer among school districts in embracing new technologies,” said Peter Kraft, Co-Founder at Evolution Labs. “The teams at both high schools continue to impress us with their commitment to employing the full range of features in our platform in order to make a material impact on how students (and their parents) experience high school.”\nAbout Evolution Labs\nEvolution Labs is changing the way students engage with schools and the way schools engage with students. Its proprietary software platform helps high schools and colleges recruit, enroll and retain students and their parents (driving key institutional goals and student learning outcomes).
