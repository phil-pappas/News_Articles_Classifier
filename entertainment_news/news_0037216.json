In his eyes, people are worthless, family is a nuisance, employees ungrateful and all no more so than at Christmas, when the insanity of love and forgiveness is allowed to run amok. But this Christmas Eve is going to be different, as Scrooge is visited by three spirits sent to offer a vision of what was, what is and what shall be. Is there time for him to repent and discover the true meaning of Christmas? \nDale Rooks, Chichester’s Youth Theatre and Education Director co-directs this production with Jake Smith. Rooks’s widely praised Youth Theatre productions include Running Wild, The Hundred and One Dalmatians, Noah, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, The Firework-Maker’s Daughter, Peter Pan and Toad of Toad Hall. Promoted stories \nJake Smith has been a Chichester Trainee Director since 2014.
