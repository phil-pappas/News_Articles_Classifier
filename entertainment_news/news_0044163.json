Getting away attracts them not as an adventure, but as a last resort. They both wonder how else “can we keep this going?”\nHughes never explicitly says what has upended this family, but reveals it through disconnected memories and other clues, beginning with Jean’s recalling a Thanksgiving spat with her husband and his walking away, maybe to visit their son Cubbie’s old room.\nPiecing together moments like these, we eventually arrive at the devastating loss that has shattered their lives: Cubbie, Lily’s younger brother, died of cancer about a year ago.\nIt’s as if this tragedy is too overwhelming to be captured in a simple summary. Its effects are scattered throughout the novel and everywhere in the lives of Jean, Nick and Lily, like the aftermath of an explosion they will never finish sorting through.\nLondon turns out to be not a fresh start but more of the same. In different ways the three family members wrestle with Cubbie’s death: remembering it, setting it aside, responding to the comments of others about it.\nBrooklyn-based Hughes — author of the bestselling novel “Wavemaker II,” a New York Times Notable Book, and the acclaimed collection “Double Happiness,” which earned a Pushcart Prize — is a superb observer and listener, finding meaning in the smallest gesture and most casual comment.\nWe see Jean, Lily and Nick struggling on their own and yet still together, intertwined and isolated at the same time. They remain capable of startling cruelty to one another as well as unexpected kindness.\nTolstoy famously observed that every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. This family is unhappy in a way that is consistently moving and human.\nThe book concludes back in New Jersey in the winter of 1971, with the marriage between Nick and Jean at “a flexible moment.”\nThe family hasn’t figured everything out, but they aren’t stuck in their grief, either. They are stumbling ahead, each at a different pace, still together.\nI admire the honesty of “The Loved Ones” and the complexity of Hughes’s characters. This is a novel that addresses a serious subject with sensitivity and care. Be patient with this sometimes frustrating novel, and you will treasure what you take away from it.\nMichael Fischer is vice president for faculty and student affairs at Trinity University .
