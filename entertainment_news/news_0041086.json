A defeat from here will mean that South Africa will walk away with the ODI series win as well. (Also Read: India vs South Africa 4th ODI – Top 5 Players to Watch Out For in Chennai ) Despite India trailing by just one match in the series, they have been outperformed by the touring sides. If not for their spinners and South African batsmen’s inability to counter spin well, India would have had a far tougher time. Shikhar Dhawan and Suresh Raina have not been getting runs. MS Dhoni has not been able to finish matches, Virat Kohli has not contributed with the bat the way he would’ve liked and Rohit Sharma, despite being in fine touch, has been running out too many batsmen. India haven’t won a match chasing since the 2015 ICC World Cup. Even in Rajkot, two of the greatest modern-day chasers in world cricket – Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni made a meal of what should’ve been an easy chase. South African pacers are doing well with Kagiso Rabada giving good support to Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel. The lack of fifth bowler has hurt them quite a bit and with doubts over JP Duminy’s availability for the fourth ODI, the pressure to find an able replacement will only mount on them. India ODI Squad: MS Dhoni (C), Virat Kohli (VC), Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Suresh Raina, Ajinkya Rahane, Ambati Rayudu, Stuart Binny, Gurkeerat Singh Mann, Axar Patel, Ravichandran Ashwin, Amit Mishra, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohit Sharma, Sreenath Arvind. South Africa ODI Squad: AB De Villiers (C), Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock, Faf Du Plessis, JP Duminy, David Miller, Farhaan Behardien, Chris Morris, Khaya Zondo, Aaron Phangiso, Imran Tahir, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Kyle Abbott, Kagiso Rabada. \n  4:59 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T14:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T15:31:11.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
