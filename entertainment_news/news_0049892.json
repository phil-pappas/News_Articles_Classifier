Prosecutors are reviewing an LAPD investigation into the 2008 alleged assault at Playboy Mansion to decide whether to charge the comedian. Jane Robison, a spokesperson for Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said on Thursday, October 1, \"The LAPD presented a case regarding Bill Cosby to our sex crimes division yesterday. It's under review. That's all I'll say.\" Chloe previously accused Bill of drugging and raping her at the Playboy Mansion when she was 18. The 24-year-old woman claimed Bill gave her a drink which caused her to black out during a party. When she awoke, she allegedly found herself naked on a bed with the 78-year-old comedian biting her toes and his pants around his ankles. Chloe was interviewed by an LAPD detective for two and a half hour back in January. Lawyers for the star of \"The Cosby Show\" later denied the allegations and insisted he was not at the party. On Wednesday, September 30, three more woman came forward with their sexual assault allegations against Bill. Sharon Van Ert, Pamela Abeyta and Lisa Christie were in tears when they shared their stories during a press conference held by Gloria Allred. Bill is due to attend a deposition in a separate sexual assault lawsuit next week. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:36:55.945+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
