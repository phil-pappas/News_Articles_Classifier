Jones Posted: Thursday, October 8, 2015, 11:43 AM \nPhilly rapper Freeway was unexpectedly diagnosed with kidney failure in September. As a result, the State Property artist had to withdraw from his September Freefest appearance, but he’s also doing something positive with his diagnosis. \nOn Sunday, Oct. 11, Freeway, whose real name is Leslie Pridgen, will be speaking at and leading Philadelphia’s Kidney Walk at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The Kidney Walk is a National Kidney Foundation initiative to raise awareness and funds for kidney disease. \nFreeway received his shocking kidney failure diagnosis after going to the doctor for a routine check-up. He was advised to get to an emergency room. From there, Freeway had to receive emergency dialysis and has received additional treatment since then. \n“I was in tears trying to understand it all,” Freeway said in a press release for the fundraising walk. \nSo he has decided to take action and raise awareness about kidney disease to the Philadelphia community. It's important to not miss your doctors appointments!! 14th annual kidney walk this Sunday in Philadelphia starting at the art museum I will be there I would love to see all of you!!!
