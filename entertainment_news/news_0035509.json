Sunny was accompanied to the event hosted by animal rights organisation People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) by her husband Daniel Weber.\nThe gala saw music legend Paul McCartney -who was joined by American singer and multi-instrumentalist Beck -perform for a sell out, star studded crowd, read a statement. \"When I first heard the name, that's what appealed to me, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. I thought that was really a very dignified, very cool title. They've got 35 years of saving so many animals. And we love them,\" McCartney said during his performance. He performed a number of hits, including Let it Be, Hey Jude, Lady Madonna, Drive my Car (performed with Beck), and an animal rights-themed song that he wrote called Looking for changes. The concert followed a humanitarian awards show hosted by Anjelic Huston and Pamela Anderson.\nMany celebrities like Bill Maher , Jason Biggs , Tommy Lee , James Cromwell , Alicia Silverstone , Noah Cyrus, Kate del Castillo, and Jillian Michaels accepted awards for helping PETA US halt cruel animal experiments, bring down the marine mammal theme park SeaWorld, and pressure Ringling Bros. circus to retire its elephants.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:14:02.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
