Aquarius is set in Los Angeles in 1967, but it has to be, because it tells the story of the early days of Charles Manson.\nThere's nothing wrong with Wicked City being set 33 years ago, but it isn't based on a real story or anything. It seems to be set in 1982, you know, just because.\n“It is inspired by the time period of Los Angeles in the early '80s when it was both the murder capital of the country and also the serial-killer capital of the country,” said creator Steven Baigelman.\n“People come (to L.A.) for fame and recognition, not only to be actors and musicians, but somehow, oddly, serial killers came here as well for that same reason.”\nAnd I guess L.A. always feels like L.A.\n“When you go drive down the (Sunset) strip on Saturday or Friday night (in current times), you see a whole lot of people out there, hoping to be discovered,” said Jeremy Sisto, who plays Detective Jack Roth. “They are looking their best, and they are full of ambition.\n“A place where people are slightly blinded by their own ambition makes for an easier world for nefarious characters to operate within.”\nThat's the setup for Wicked City, in which the nefarious character is Kent Grainger, played by Ed Westwick.\nKent is a slick and resourceful dude who is adept at pretending to be different people. He has a way with women, right up until he murders them. “I was you,” Kent says repeatedly to wide-eyed females. “People helped me out, so kill me, I like giving back.”\nAs women continue to perish, Detective Jack Roth and his ambitious new partner Paco Contreras (Gabriel Luna) are assigned to the case. They catch a break when they come across Karen McLaren (Taissa Farmiga), a struggling journalist who – unbeknownst to her at the time – was approached by Kent at a club.\nMeanwhile, Kent's stalking takes an eyebrow-raising turn when he hooks up with Betty Beaumontaine, played by Erika Christensen. At first viewing Betty merely as another potential victim, Kent may have found someone who is just as twisted as he is.\nDating back to his days on Gossip Girl, Westwick obviously has the perfect sneer for playing bad guys. But Christensen's Betty is more chilling, in a subtle way.\n“Of course, part of being an actor is really wanting to explore humanity, and it was a good 180 (-degree turn),” said Christensen, referring to her previous role on the long-running Parenthood.\n“(Betty) goes down the rabbit hole with (Kent), and I find that really interesting from where she starts, a nurse and single mom, kind of a cowed person, not super confident, not super comfortable in her own skin, and she may blossom.”\nWell, blossom in a wicked sense.\nWicked City is yet another TV show about serial killers, so if that's a deal-breaker for you, there's no way around it. Otherwise, Wicked City is fairly decent, I guess, for network fare in 2015. I like the cast more than the story at this point, so I'll have to see where things go.\nAgain, I'm not sure setting it in 1982 necessarily adds much, outside of wardrobe and pay phones and music. But hey, what do I know? Maybe I'm just dancing with myself.\nTwitter: @billharris_tv\nbill.harris@sunmedia.ca\nABC's 'Wicked City' set in the 1980s - but did it need to be?\nBy Bill Harris , Postmedia Network First posted: Sunday, October 25, 2015 01:00 PM EDT\nThe very first thing you hear is Billy Idol, singing the praises of dancing with himself.\nThe new series Wicked City is set in 1982 in Los Angeles, and it wastes no time trying to get you in the mood.
