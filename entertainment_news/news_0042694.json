Sean’s mum, Lisa Tarala, died last year.\nConnell, a human resources manager, claimed she fell and hurt herself when Sean, excited to see her, leapt into her arms at his eighth birthday party four years ago.\nDespite admitting she loves the youngster, who has always been “very loving, sensitive” toward her, the New Yorker wanted him to cough up $US127,000 ($173,000) in damages.\nOther Stories The horror of MH17’s final 90 seconds News 0 comments Who were Playboy’s Aussie stars?

And we all know how crowded it is in Manhattan,” she told a Connecticut court on Friday.\nShe told the jurors that the broken wrist still gives her problems even now.\n“I was at a party recently, and it was difficult to hold my hors d’oeuvre plate,” she said.\nScene ... Jennifer Connell was injured at the Connecticut home of her nephew. Picture: Googlemaps The court heard Connell attended Sean’s birthday party at his Connecticut home on March 18, 2011. When the boy saw his aunt, he ran toward her, exclaiming, “Aunty Jen, Aunty Jen.”\n“All of a sudden he was there in the air, I had to catch him and we tumbled on to the ground,” Connell, who doesn’t have children, testified. “I remember him shouting, ‘Aunty Jen, I love you,’ and there he was flying at me.”\nMs Connell said she didn’t complain about her injury at the time because she didn’t want to upset Sean. But now she claims her life has been turned upside down.\n“The injuries, losses and harms to the plaintiff were caused by the negligence and carelessness of the minor defendant, in that a reasonable eight-year-old under those circumstances would know or should have known that a forceful greeting such as the one delivered by the defendant to the plaintiff could cause the harms and losses suffered by the plaintiff,” Connell’s bizarre lawsuit claims.\nA six-member Superior Court jury decided on the lawsuit.\n— with The New York Post\nOriginally published as ‘I love you, but you owe me &#36;173k’", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/28af8dadff31cd3b6307af5dec4ba8cb?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/47d0ba3dcfc7d0e1945efb38c38f5fd8", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c425d8e603a72200be1a612f0e2f9ce2", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/aunt-sues-12-year-old-nephew-for-173000-for-accidentally-breaking-her-wrist-while-greeting-her/story-fnq2oad4-1227568194734?sv=22f64f87394b422aae836cd6152b8bfe", "http://www.ctpost.com/news/article/8-year-old-boy-on-trial-for-exuberance-6566757.php", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/29aa8c9e7df2fc3d60f1cedc5efbb1b7", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/4239c7afe20d17751cdd8315329319d8", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0b6982a1678b0da22950bcaee37eaf7c", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c80d0385f326782e548c83e83205d9f1", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-10-14T08:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:10:54.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
