While Jayachandran apparently expressed concern over the fact that the movie also has Ramesh Narayanan's songs, the Hindustani musician called him up and said that shouldn't be a problem. All the songs of the film became chart busters soon after its release.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:50:47.167+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
