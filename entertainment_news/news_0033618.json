Quirky stories in verse, these Beastly Tales come from across the world. Here, the animals are the protagonists and the fables familiar, but wait a minute, for the surprising twists and turns will keep you hooked until the end. Amusing, perceptive and sometimes scary, these tales meld the human and the animal, reflecting the best and worst of both. They help explore the essence of Motley's philosophy over the last 15 years to perform on stage without any trappings and let words alone convey these wonderful characters and great stories. This is a show for all ages but specially geared to convey to children that there is more to poetry than just rhyming couplets. The play is scheduled to take place on October 8 (7.30 pm) at Chowdiah Memorial Hall, 16th Cross, GD Park Extension, 2nd Main Road, Malleswaram.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T11:46:34.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
