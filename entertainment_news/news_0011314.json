And today's quite interesting news is that I've been announced as the new presenter of Qi. My dream telly job and I have huge shoes to fill \n— Sandi Toksvig (@sanditoksvig) October 14, 2015 \nBut it seemed fitting to pay tribute to Stephen’s wit, charm and anecdotes over the years that have made QI one of the BBC’s best loved programmes. \nAnd thankfully resident panellist Alan Davies, the punchline of many of Stephen’s jokes, will also remain as right-hand man and font of useless knowledge. \nHere are some of our top Stephen Fry moments: \n(Watch out for strong language) \n“They say of the Acropolis where the Parthenon is…” \nWhen Stephen got tongue-tied, it led to Bill Bailey, Jimmy Carr and Alan start chanting “They say of the Acropolis where the Parthenon is…”, leaving Stephen in hysterics. \nStephen puts Alan in his place \nWait for Alan’s face when he realises his ‘pink polenta’ mistake, and Stephen doesn’t miss a beat to disagree with sparring partner. But Alan gets his own back which he finally gets something right. Promoted stories \n“Posh biscuits are those that are cooked for you by your pastry chef” \nDon’t question Stephen’s Abbey Crunch. \n“You cannot be that stupid!” \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duqlZXiIZqA \n“Are you incapable of rational thought?” A flabbergast Stephen (wearing a wizard’s costume) scolds Lee Mack for not understanding the I before E except after C rule. Plus, this clip contains Daniel Radcliffe. \nStephen’s Scottish accents \nYou won’t be able to put your finger on quite where these all originate, but they’re nonetheless perfect. Just like Stephen. \n“What kind of hellish quiz is this?” \nPhil Jupitus does a spot-on impression of the host when the QI elves decide that there’s no odd-one-out on the odd-one-out round. \n“Labrador groomer: rumour” \nStephen’s attempt at Cockney rhyming-slang is a little too middle-class for his panellists to cope with. \n“You’re saying I have more ancestors than people there have ever been” \nSean Locke couldn’t get a grip on Stephen’s latest “mind-blowing” fact. \nStephen’s QI elves get the better of David Mitchell Share article \nWatch Stephen sit back in glee as David Mitchell goes on an angry rant about the origins of the name WWI.
