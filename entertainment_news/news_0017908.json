The Mask Orchestra was seen not only as an exciting new band, it was ground breaking. Twenty-five years on, Colin Towns Mask Orchestra is back. The new double album Drama will be the group's seventh release and boasts a line-up featuring a veritable who’s who of jazz’s finest, alongside handpicked players of the new generation.
