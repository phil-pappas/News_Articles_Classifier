Comment Posted Oct. 24, 2015 at 9:08 AM Updated at 12:49 PM Posted Oct. 24, 2015 at 9:08 AM Updated at 12:49 PM Two more women have come forward accusing Bill Cosby of drugging and sexually assaulting them, People reports. One of the women, who chose to only be identified as Dottye, says that she went to Cosby's New York City brownstone to audition for The Cosby Show in 1984. Cosby allegedly gave Dottye a drugged drink, took off Dottye's clothes and put them in his washing machine. Cosby then washed Dottye before raping her. The following day, Cosby called Dottye and tried to engage in phone sex, but the aspiring actress declined. Dottye later attended a taping of The Cosby Show a nd introduced Cosby to her parents after one of his performances in Las Vegas. \"I did not realize until last year when the other women started telling their stories that I was drugged that night,\" she said. \"I went home ashamed, hating myself for 'letting him have his way.' I thought he was wrong but at that time I thought so was I.\" Bill Cosby fires lawyer Martin Singer The other woman, Donna Barrett, claims she was officiating a track meet at the University of Pennsylvania in 2004 when Cosby grabbed her from behind and held her to him. \"He had his arm on my waist and forcefully pulled me onto his private area saying, 'Hey, back that thing up here girl, back it on up!,'\" she wrote in a statement. \"I felt his private parts against my backside.\" Barrett says she tried to pull away, but Cosby held her arm down and gripped her waist. After Cosby left, Barrett says she complained to officials \"but no one knew what to do.\" More than 50 women have accused the comedian of sexual assault, with the alleged incidents dating back nearly 50 years. Attorney Gloria Allred, who is representing the two women as well as nearly half of the alleged victims, said she has been contacted by even more women who plan to go public. \"Each story must be told because there can never be accountability without truth and there can never be enough truth,\" Allred said in a statement. \"[Cosby] must hope that this scandal would end so that he can try to repair his public image and perhaps continue to attack victims who have come forward by having his representatives tell us that they are not to be believed because they have waited so long to speak their truth. I can assure Mr. Cosby, however, that there are still more victims who will be courageous enough to come forward in the future.\" Page 2 of 2 - Other Links From TVGuide.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T20:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T17:36:12.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
