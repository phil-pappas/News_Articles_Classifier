As the largest launching pad to the fall movie season, the Toronto Film Festival which begins on Thursday, Sept. 10, 2015, is a regular home to the biopics and other true-life tales that usually populate awards season. Documentaries inspired two of the most notable films set to premiere: Freeheld, in which Moore and Page play a humble New Jersey lesbian couple fighting for the rights of married couple, and Our Brand Is Crisis, David Gordon Greens dramatization of the intrusion of American campaign politics into a Bolivia election.

This took place in 2005 and 2006 in New Jersey, where inheritance rights for domestic partners were not guaranteed at the time.\nYet for about half of “Freeheld,” the movie is not about a court case but a courtship. Laurel Hester ( Julianne Moore ) is a career investigator with the police department in Ocean City, and her private life is a mystery to her co-workers, even her partner ( Michael Shannon ), who is rather hopelessly attracted to her. She meets Stacie Andree ( Ellen Page ) while playing volleyball, and the two gradually become a couple.\nMore Information Freeheld\n★★★\nQuick take: A solid formula film\nCouples that last usually have an interesting power dynamic in which one partner can never completely dominate the other. Stacie is bolder in her sexuality — she’s completely out in a way that Laurel isn’t. At the same time, Laurel is about 20 years older and more advanced in her career, which gives her a certain edge in the relationship.\nThe give and take between Laurel and Stacie (and Moore and Page) is complicated and appealing. We’d like being around them even if the movie weren’t heading somewhere, though, alas, “Freeheld” never does let us forget where it’s heading. As Laurel, Moore is smoking almost constantly, by way of preparing us for the lung cancer that takes over the story.\nBeyond the specifics of the case, “Freeheld” is really a document in favor of gay marriage, making an argument in the most unimpeachable terms imaginable. (It also, typical of movies, makes the argument after public opinion has already shifted on the issue and the cause is already won.) Laurel is not just a nice person who deserves rights, but an honest cop with a long history of public service. To deny her what a straight person would get as a matter of course, and to fill her last days with anxiety, seems obscene.\nIt would be an interesting exercise to compare “Freeheld” to “Philadelphia” to measure the movement in public opinion. During the depths of the AIDS crisis in 1993, “Philadelphia” reduced the awfulness of the protagonist’s imminent and untimely death into a court case about his losing his job. Losing his job was the least of his problems, but it was as if the general public needed that element rather than have to face directly what was happening to gay people in that dark time.\nYou might say “Philadelphia” was a way of acknowledging the humanity of the protagonist (and those he stood for) obliquely. “Freeheld,” in contrast, recognizes that humanity as a given and makes the case for complete legal and social equality — but again, by using a terminally ill protagonist as a kind of insurance against censure. Societies change, but the movies stay the same.\nMoore gives us a proud woman dragged unwillingly into the abyss of illness, and she is emotionally and physically convincing as someone in her last days. But after “Still Alice,” I’m getting a little sick of watching Moore get sick, and I would like her to stay healthy for an entire film.\nAs Stacie, Page is lovely, giving us someone who is boyish and bashful and not afraid to show when she feels in over her head. Also worth noting is Shannon, who has the iciest stare in the business. Has he ever broken gaze first? No, but then why should he?\n“Freeheld” is formulaic, but some formulas are good if you do them right, and it helps knowing that it all really happened, or most of it. During the closing credits, they show pictures of the real Laurel and Stacie, and it’s clear that these images informed the making of the film.\nRunning time: 103 minutes\nMPAA rating: PG-13 (thematic elements, profanity, sexuality)", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793655/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793656/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793660/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793659/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793654/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/40/74/42/8636553/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793660/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793653/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793653/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793657/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793659/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793656/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/40/74/42/8636553/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793654/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793657/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793655/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T13:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T13:46:41.699+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
