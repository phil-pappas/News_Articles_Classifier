A few years ago I went back to school for screenwriting; so I have three working scripts that I’m working on getting produced.”\n“Boy Meets World” had a steady fan base during its seven-year run, and it has only grown in popularity since the show went into syndication. With spinoff “Girl Meets World” in its second season, Ward couldn’t be more proud of the show she worked on.\n“I think it’s great for a new generation of kids especially because their parents watched all of us on the show,” she explained. “To raise your kids with the same thing, except a different version, I think it’s a really cool thing, and it’s a great moral show and good values for kids to grow up with.”\nMany of the show’s former stars have headed to the spinoff for cameos and guest spots. Ward revealed her character may make a comeback on “Girl Meets World.”\n“Yes, it’s always in the possibility coming up. I’ve had a lot of talks about it. Definitely a possibility.”\nAnd Ward couldn’t be happier re-connecting with her old cast members.\n“Ever since the new show came around, everybody got in touch again –even though I had talked to them over the years quite a bit but separately. The show has really brought everyone back together, and that’s what really special about it too.”\nRecently Ward has shed her good girl “Boy Meets World” image, as she’s been photographed in revealing outfits and costumes at red carpet events. She said dressing up is like playing a character.\nMy Grand Finale! Cosplay Mashup.

It feels like I’m playing a character and I kind of transform into what that character is.”\nShe advised that confidence is the key.\n“I try to be confident. I think it’s important for women to be confident and secure in their bodies no matter what. Just own yourself,” she said. “Just go out there and be brave and confident and do what you want, no shame!”\nAnd right now Ward is focusing on her future and her upcoming professional endeavors.\n“I’m working on getting my own stuff together. I’ve been putting a lot of time and energy into that so I’m also going to start another movie soon within the next month, a comedy, and I actually play a not so nice character, which is unusual for me. I usually play more of a nicer person.”", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/p/7lvtjCx5t9/"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:34:25.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
