But the determination to play hard cost her a spot in the game when the 32-year-old San Francisco Yahoo executive became the second castaway eliminated from Survivor Cambodia: Second Chance this week.\n“It was a much more lighthearted season for me,” Oskooi told Postmedia Network after the Ta Keo tribe snuffed out her torch. Straight out of the gate upon landing on the beaches of Cambodia, Shirin and ally Spencer Bledsoe were immediately focused on the strategic elements of the experience and were ultimately responsible for the season’s inaugural ouster of yoga instructor, Vytas Baskauskas. But it was that accelerated game-play that made her a main target when old-school player Jeff Varner looked to take out the focused castaway early in the game.\n“After I won that Vytas vote, I should have just laid low and then let things pan out the way that they were going to and stayed out of the crosshairs, but there was so much strategy talk going on constantly,” Shirin said.\nShirin Oskooi talks 'Survivor'\nAnd when Abi-Maria Gomes felt ostracized by her majority alliance, following a major blowout with Peih Gee, the “Brazilian Dragon” raised concerns that Shirin hadn’t come to her aid, especially considering the Yahoo exec had faced so many vicious personal attacks last season from her Survivor: Worlds Apart tribe-members. Using the opportunity to his advantage, Jeff and Terry Deitz managed to scoop up Abi’s vote against Shirin heading into tribal council, giving them the majority votes against her.\nDuring council, however, host Jeff Probst compared Abi’s post-blowout tribal exclusion to the controversial issues Shirin faced last season, comparisons Shirin insists are invalid.\n“I actually was viciously attacked on a personal level and in ugly ways by a number of people on Worlds Apart, whereas Abi was the one doing all the personal attacking in our season. You didn’t even see a fraction of it. She was constantly lashing out at every single person,” Shirin says.\nBut as reprimanding as Probst’s comparisons were, Shirin admits she was still in the midst of dealing with the cruelty she faced last season which remained fresh in her mind after travelling directly from the heated Survivor: Worlds Apart finale to the beaches of Cambodia, a rapid cycle that acted as a blessing and a curse for her new game.\n“On one hand, playing the game was really fresh for me and I knew which instincts of mine to trust and which ones not to trust. I was ready to go right away. On the other hand, my experience was unusually emotional and opened up some really deep wounds and I didn’t have enough time to heal from those wounds. I certainly didn’t have enough time to process everything that happened to me.”\nNext week, the tribes are divided into three entirely new groups.
