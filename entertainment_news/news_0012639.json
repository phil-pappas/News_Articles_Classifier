Sixty percent — 60! — of all the Williamses on the roster are sidelined. Keep your head on a swivel, Duke and Mario.\nAnd that revamped offense? It's probably in the whirlpool.\nHeading into Week 7, multiple Bills are sidelined or questionable for the game Sunday against the Jacksonville Jaguars in London. Here's a recap of some of the key players who are out and why.\n– QB Tyrod Taylor , who was already dealing with a bum ankle, injured his knee against the Titans and was inactive against the Bengals.\n– WR Sammy Watkins left Sunday's game at the end of the first half with an ankle injury and did not return.\n– DT Kyle Williams suffered a knee injury in the fourth quarter and could be out several weeks.\n- RB Karlos Williams suffered a concussion in the Bills' loss to the Giants and has been put under the NFL's concussion protocol.\n– WR Percy Harvin was inactive Sunday due to an ongoing hip injury.\n- FS Aaron Williams suffered a neck injury against the Patriots, missed two games, then returned to play well against the Titans. But, he aggravated the injury and the decision was made to shut him down and place him on Injured Reserve (designated for return).\n– OT Seantrel Henderson left Sunday's game in the first quarter with a concussion and did not return.\n- Special teams ace Marcus Easley is dealing with a shoulder injury he suffered against the Titans and did not play in Week 6 against the Bengals.\n– WR Marquise Goodwin reinjured his ribs in the third quarter Sunday and did not return.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nSammy Watkins injures ankle on TD catch", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/301c94b647cdf22e31e809ad526b9d1966985540/c=282-0-2106-1824/local/-/media/2015/10/18/Rochester/Rochester/635807893175986459-JG-101815-Bills-10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-20T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:03:50.619+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
