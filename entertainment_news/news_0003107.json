October 8th 2015 25 minutes ago /video/video.news.com.au/Entertainment/ \nGordon-Levitt’s highwire act is all in the name of dramatising and recreating the most famous performance of French tightrope artiste Philippe Petit, who was the subject of the 2009 Oscar winner for Best Documentary, Man on Wire . \nIn 1974, Petit strung a wire between the two towers of the World Trade Centre in New York, then spent 45 minutes up there — 411 metres off the ground — crossing between the two buildings, dancing, kneeling, even laying down on the wire. \nThe Walk , directed by Robert “ Back to the Future ” Zemeckis, comes on like a heist film, showing how Petit (Gordon-Levitt) and his crew (which includes Charlotte Le Bon as girlfriend and Sir Ben Kingsley as mentor) evaded guards to get into the towers, before culminating with the stunning, jaw-dropping feat.

In The Walk , Zemeckis’ 3D recreation has turned out to be a little too realistic for some — reports out of early screenings in the US have audience members feeling queasy and anxious or, in the worst cases, vomiting. \nGordon-Levitt has evidence to back these claims up: When he watched The Walk with his dad, Dennis Levitt would “yelp out in fear, frequently,” says his son. \nAnd that is exactly what Zemeckis was going for. \n“I really wanted to evoke the feeling of vertigo in the audience,” says the director. “I worked hard to do that. I spent a lot of hours looking at films and standing on the ledges of high places ... The audience had to feel that they were up there on that wire. So I had a lot of fun creating this illusion.” If you truly want to experience the magic of cinema, go see #TheWalk in 3D @IMAX . It was SPECTACULAR!!!

He found this old, unused warehouse and set up a real steel cable. We spent eight days straight, all day, practising,” the actor explains. \n“He was insistent that at the end I would be able to walk on the wire, which sounded ambitious to me, but that actually happened. It’s an addictive physical activity, because when you’re hitting it, you get this rush of positive reinforcement; you don’t want to stop even though it really kills your feet.” \nAt first Petit had Gordon-Levitt on a wire barely a metre off the ground. \n“There,” he says, “there is no fear of heights because you can just step off whenever you lose your balance.” \nBut when he’d got the hang of that, Petit raised the wire to 3.7 metres (or 12 feet) — the same height at which Gordon-Levitt performed for filming. The same height the fear set in. \n“Obviously 12 feet is not nearly as high as what Philippe did atop the World Trade Centre,” says Gordon-Levitt, “but you’d be surprised how big a difference that extra 10 feet makes. My whole body felt tighter and anxious.” Charlotte Le Bon, as Petit’s girlfriend, hitches a ride in The Walk (Sony Pictures) Source: AP \nNot that Gordon-Levitt was able to articulate those anxieties. Petit’s first rule of tightrope club is: you do not talk about fears in tightrope club. \n“One of the things I find really interesting about Philippe is how he manipulates himself,” Gordon-Levitt elaborates. “One of the first lines in the movie, he mentions death then he says, ‘But I never say this word; you will never hear me say it again’. \n“His use of language helps him focus. When he was teaching me, when I would fall off he would say, ‘No, you don’t fall . You never fall . I never want to hear you say the word fall . You decide to step off when it’s time’. \n“At first, it’s performance: you’re thinking ‘I’m falling’ but you don’t say it. After a while, you stop using that word and you start feeling differently. It really works.” \nPetit’s New York stunt followed similar efforts at the Notre Dame in Paris in 1971 and between Sydney Harbour Bridge pylons in 1973. \nGordon-Levitt reckons the Frenchman does have fear, but that it is what drove him to such feats: “He would be less attracted to hanging a highwire between the two towers of the World Trade Center and walking on it if it weren’t so impossible, if it weren’t so terrifying.” Gordon-Levitt, seen here in Inception, is no stranger to mind-bending, hair-raising stunts (Roadshow) Source: Supplied \nAnd what percentage of it is simply insanity? \n“A significant percentage, yes,” Gordon-Levitt says with a laugh. “And he’d be the first to admit it. But that’s part of what makes the character so interesting for me to play as an actor — to play someone who on the one hand is this brilliant, courageous artist and on the other hand is losing his mind. There you have the makings of a character you can really sink your teeth into.” \nPetit also has a reputation as being a perfectionist and control freak ... \n“Oh, he’s an enormous control freak. Again he would be the first to admit it,” says Gordon-Levitt. “Am I a perfectionist? Sometimes I can be. But I try to remain aware that if you focus too uniquely on perfection it can be paralysing. If you only wait for perfection, you’ll wait your whole life.” \nGordon-Levitt’s next trick of turning a real life icon into grist for the dramatic mill will be to play CIA whistleblower Edward Snowden in the Oliver Stone biopic Snowden , due for release next year.

He did tell AP that he sees parallels between whistleblower and highwire walker: “Philippe is the quintessential artist who believes in beauty and whimsy. Edward Snowden is the quintessential engineer who believes in logic and facts.” \nAs for his own parallels with Petit, Gordon-Levitt admits he has felt like he’s facing the mental hurdle of taking that first step onto the wire in many facets of his career, including when he made the leap to directing on 2013’s Don Jon . \nEven just his day job, something he’s been doing since he popped up aged seven on Family Ties , still causes that rush of adrenaline. \n“Every time they say ‘rolling’ there’s something a little bit magic that happens for me,” he says. “It’s certainly not as intense as being 110 stories up in the air and taking your first step out onto a wire between two towers, but ...” \nTHE WALK SCREENS IN ADVANCE PREVIEWS TOMORROW-SUNDAY, THEN OPENS OCTOBER 15", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T05:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T05:21:48.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
