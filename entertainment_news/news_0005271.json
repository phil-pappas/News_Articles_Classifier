But reports claiming that my brother Sharath Mandava is directing the remake is what shocked me. I just want to clarify that Sharath isn't even distantly related to me. We just share our surnames,\" explains Prashanth.\nInterestingly, the confusion might have begun considering that Prashanth had worked with another Sharat (Varma) who was the co-director for Pratinidhi . \"He is a very close friend and almost like a brother to me! But I never thought that people would confuse him with Sharath Mandava,\" he laughs.\nPratinidhi is being remade in Tamil as Ko2 featuring Prakash Raj and Bobby Simha in key roles. Sharath, in a recent interview, shared that 60 per cent of the film's script has been altered for the remake.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T13:48:21.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
