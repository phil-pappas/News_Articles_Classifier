The singer gave BBC Radio Two the green light to premiere \"Lost and Found\" on Wednesday, October 21 before she releases it on iTunes later this week as the LP's latest promotional single. The mid-tempo pop tune was co-produced by hitmaker Max Martin, who's also behind Goulding's most recent hits \"On My Mind\" and \"Love Me Like You Do\". \"Is there anybody out there waiting for me on my way?\" she sings on the chorus. \"If that somebody is you, then baby, I just wanna say/ Tonight, nothing will bring us down/ Tonight, we're at the lost and found.\" Goulding's \"Delirium\" album is scheduled to arrive on November 6 as a follow-up to her 2012 full-length \" Halcyon \" and its 2013 re-issue \" Halcyon Days \". In addition to lead single \"On My Mind\" and \"Love Me Like You Do\" which is also featured on the \" Fifty Shades of Grey \" soundtrack, the forthcoming set has also spawned \"Something In the Way You Move\" that's available as instant download for fans who pre-order the album. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T12:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:54:49.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
