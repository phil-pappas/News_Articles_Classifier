He said branches were also deliberately kept smaller so that those who wanted to manipulate membership registers could easily manage to do so.\n“These tendencies make voters unhappy. They create a perception that the ANC has become a self-serving organisation, or one that deviates from its core values,” said Zuma.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T22:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:36:59.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
