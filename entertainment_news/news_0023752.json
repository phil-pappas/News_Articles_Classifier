Break out the candy corn and try these Halloween picks from across the globe. Edith Scob as the masked Christiane in Georges Fanu's thoughtful horror film \"Eyes Without a Face\" (1960). \n'Eyes Without a Face' (1960)French title: \"Les yeux sans visage\" How can a movie be so very French, and yet still titillate as only a horror film can? An imperious surgeon (Pierre Brasseur) who specializes in organ transplanting just so happens to have a daughter (Edith Scob) whose face is destroyed in a car accident. (Daddy was at the wheel; daughter accuses him of making her his guinea pig.) Scob's masked Christiane lives like a ghost in her own home, moving virtually unnoticed while her father and his fatally devoted assistant (Alida Valli) lure the next unwitting facial donor. \"Eyes\" became infamous for its gory face-transplant sequence, but at heart, Georges Franju's film is artsy, weird, sad and quite beautiful. The face of Barbara Steel dominates this movie poster for Mario Bava's \"Black Sunday\" (1960). \n'Black Sunday' (1960)Italian title: \"La maschera del demonio\" Noir-ish period horror is the best phrase to categorize Mario Bava's \"Black Sunday,\" his preeminent film. Bava has a penchant for composition, camera movement, atmosphere and good \"shocks.\" Saucer-eyed beauty Barbara Steel is magnetic in dual roles as a 200-year-old witch and an innocent princess. You'd swear British Steel was born in, and never left, Italy. (\"Black Sunday\" is the first in a string of horror films she made there.) The story involves a witch and her master (Arturo Dominici), who were executed in the 17th century; for good measure, spiked masks were nailed into their faces. The duo returns to wreak vengeance upon her family, which organized their messy deaths. Peter Cushing plays Victor Frankenstein as a stinker in Hammer Films' \"The Curse of Frankenstein\" (1957). \n'The Curse of Frankenstein' (1957)Directed by Terrence Fisher, the first of Hammer Films' stylish color horror movies spawned a filmic movement, and still holds up as a genre classic. Peter Cushing plays Victor Frankenstein as a stinker. His maid-turned-mistress (Valerie Gaunt) knows it; his tutor-turned-lackey (Robert Urquhart) knows it; even his patch-quilt monster (Christopher Lee) knows it. If Victor needs a brain for his unholy experiments, he simply invites one of Europe's greatest minds to dinner, and then pushes him off a staircase. The only one in the dark is Victor's trusting fiance, Elizabeth (Hazel Court). Lee pulls off a small miracle as the tortured monster, somehow garnering sympathy beneath the scabs, scars and Beatle wig. German Robles made his film debut as the title fiend in the Mexican horror film \"El Vampiro\" (1957) \n'The Vampire' (1957)Mexican title: \"El Vampiro\" Azteca Films' horror movies never got a fair shake in the States, thanks largely to the English dubbing, which was often unintentionally funny. Fernando Méndez's \"El Vampiro\" (the Spanish-language original) is a morbid, moody piece that pays homage to the old Bela Lugosi films, then ramps up the vampiric clichés: bigger fangs, bigger cape collars, bigger bats. It also magnifies the religiosity that lurks in vampire movies; one character clutches a three-foot crucifix at all times. In his film debut, Germán Robles is a fully formed talent as Count Lavud; he's sinister and wears the cape-and-tuxedo well. Abel Salazar (who also produced) has a light chemistry with Ariadne Welter, as charming hero and virginal heroine. Zombie emerge from a musty tomb in the Spanish horror film \"The Blind Dead\" (1972). \n'The Blind Dead' (1972)Spanish title: \"La noche del terror ciego\" Here is a unique zombie movie with a decidedly Spanish sensibility. The zombies are ancient knights who gained immortality via that magic elixir found in so many horror films: virgins' blood. But the knights were convicted and hung until crows pecked out their eyes — making them blind zombies. (Be careful, though; they can hear your heartbeat.) When the zombies ride horses in slo-mo, it's pretty creepy, but most entertaining in Amando de Ossorio's film is the modern-day setup involving two women who were once college roommates. They had a little fling way back when, and now finds themselves vying for the same man. However, once the zombies arise, all bets are off. Despite its ludicrous plot about head-transplanting, the German horror film \"The Head\" was written and directed by an Oscar nominee. \n'The Head' (1959)German title: \"Die Nackte und der Satan\" A fat, sweaty surgeon (Michel Simon) promises to operate on a pretty nurse (Karin Kernke) who has a cruelly deformed body. Then he hires a Dr. Ood (Horst Frank), who promptly cuts off the surgeon's head, keeping it alive with tubes. Ood later beheads a stripper (Christiane Maybach) from the nearby Tam-Tam nightclub, grafting the nurse's head onto the stripper's body. They don't make movie like this any more. Written and directed by Victor Trivas, an Oscar nominee for his story about post-war Nazis in Orson Welles' \"The Stranger\" (1946). More history: The production was designed by Hermann Warm, who 39 years before art-directed one of the earliest horror films, \"Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari.\" \"Gojira\" is a dark monster movie with strong themes of pacifism — that is, before the Americans got ahold of it. \n'Gojira' (1954)In 1956, a monster movie starring Raymond Burr about a giant lizard that attacks Japan played American theaters. \"Gojira\" ain't it. That was \"Godzilla, King of the Monsters,\" a version of \"Gojira\" which was \"Americanized\" via the insertion of English-language footage with Burr (alongside every Japanese extra in Hollywood). Ishirô Honda's darker 1954 original is a much different film, with strong themes of pacifism. Prof. Yamane (Kurosawa player Takashi Shimura) argues against killing Gojira, while Dr. Serizawa (Akihiko Hirata) doesn't want his superweapon — the only hope to stop the monster — to fall into the hands of politicians. One can't help but think \"Gojira\" is making a statement about Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The green, skull-faced monster from the Filipino horror film \"The Mad Doctor of Blood Island\" (1969). \n'The Mad Doctor of Blood Island' (1969)Second in the so-called \"Blood Island trilogy,\" \"Mad Doctor\" was produced for the American drive-in market, but make no mistake: This is a Filipino movie, directed by two natives (Eddie Romero and Gerardo de Leon) with a Filipino cast, save for a couple of white Americans (\"Beach Blanket Bingo\" player John Ashley and \"Star Trek\" player Angelique Pettyjohn) thrown in to, again, \"Americanize\" the movie. \"Mad Doctor\" is like \"The Magnificent Ambersons\" with blood; it has more than its share of soap opera-like secrets. Characters withhold information from the audience, exchanging meaningful glances that imply: We have history. Even so, a green, jack-o'-lantern-faced monster remains this film's bread and butter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T16:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:45:00.681+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
