That’s about the price of three to fifteen months of a gym membership, depending on where you live and whether your gym has a cold-pressed juice bar. My daily(ish) routine consisted of a 30-minute run in my neighborhood followed by 30 minutes of flexin’. There are three undeniable advantages to owning a home gym:\nThey’re cheaper. You’re bound to save in the long run, especially when you factor in the price of gas and the “I’m a weak, weak man” churros you buy outside the gym and eat in your parked car. They’re more convenient. You can theoretically work out at any hour, and the longest commute to the gym is up a flight of stairs. You control the environment. Don’t want to lift to “Call Me Maybe”? Great. Want to lift exclusively to “Call Me Maybe?” Even better. The only sweat on the machine is your own, and the only judgmental stares are from your cats. Especially that haughty Sir Catrick Stewart. The disadvantages of a home gym, however, are as varied as they are personally embarrassing, and I leave it to you, dear reader, to determine if it’s worth the cost. Let’s dive in.\nHome gyms are not a turn-on. I thought owning a home gym would project an air of health, much how I thought as a college freshman that making origami projected an air of mystery. I was wrong on both counts. A home gym isn’t going to make your date think you look like Ralph Fiennes in Maid in Manhattan. Instead, you will look like Ralph Fiennes in Red Dragon . (Or maybe it’s just me thinking of Ralph Fiennes all the time?)\nHome gyms are noisy. At a crowded gym, the clanging and grunting and wheezing sounds of your workout are lost amidst the general cacophony. But not at home. You will realize that the sound you make while working out is eerily similar to the sound Guy Fieri makes while having a real love affair with a malted milkshake.\nYour hygiene will slide. The ritual of a trip to the gym encourages regular post-workout showers. But with your gym next to your bed, you might decide to answer some emails before showering, then get a bowl of cereal, and the next thing you know you’ve been sitting in your stink for three hours. “I’m dry already, so why shower?” you’ll ask yourself, which, oddly enough, is an anagram for “I can’t wait to die alone.”\nIf you run on the street, every single day a different person will shout, “Run, Forrest, run!” at you, and then laugh at their own hilarious, topical joke. On the other hand, if your building installs a few treadmills on the roof, they will all be occupied from 5:00 AM to 10:00 PM. After 10:00 PM only one will be in use, but the elderly man using it will smell like sausage and have sweat stains in unspeakable places.\nWhile regular gyms are death traps, home gyms are solitary death traps. If you’re using traditional weights, at some point you’ll overextend yourself and get trapped beneath them. It’s just a fact. Best case scenario, you’ll wriggle free and take the secret to your grave. And even if you own a fancy Bowflex with its resistance rod technology, you’re still going to end up, at least once, hopelessly tangled in the cords, reenacting some sort of Hannibal Lecter death tableau — like a scene from Red Dragon or something!\nWithout scary men and women there to intimidate you, you might eventually revert to some strange, socially unconscionable workout habits. Some people scream. Others sing. More still smell themselves way too frequently. As for me, I discovered I kinda liked working out in as close to total darkness as possible. Creepy, right? Whatever, I don’t have to explain myself to you. I am the Dragon.\nWhen you eventually abandon your lifelong dream of not being shaped like a potato, your regular gym membership can die a quiet death, with your membership card discretely slipping to the back of your wallet. When you give up on a home gym, however, and its weight racks become makeshift clothes hangers, its padded bench now your room’s least comfortable chair, you’ll be reminded of your failure every day. That is, until you lug the thing out to the curb, but that type of workout really defeats the point of giving up on fitness.\nSo what do you think? Stick with a normal gym? Buy one of your own? Gradually meld with your couch? The choice is yours. As long as it isn’t CrossFit.\nSee the full story at www.Savings.com </p", "external_links": ["http://www.savings.com/blog/post/home-gym-ownership.html"], "published": "2015-10-18T10:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T21:04:28.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
