Marietta's Zach Seabaugh will go into it armed with cowboy boots and his grandfather's dog tags. \nWhen asked about the moment all four judges turned their chairs for him, Seabaugh told 11Alive's Vinnie Politan and Chesley McNeil , \"I don't really remember much of it. They weren't really turning around, and I was planning on going home.\" \nWithin the last few seconds of his performance, those plans changed dramatically. Seabaugh wasn't lured by Adam Levine's flattery; he called him \"Superman\". He wasn't drawn in by Gwen Stefani comments about his good looks. Instead, he went with country music star Blake Shelton. \"The reason I love country music is the story it tells,\" Seabaugh said. Marietta's Zach Seabaugh is on Blake Shelton's team on The Voice.

It's why he wears his grandfather's dog tags from the Korean War around his neck. Seabaugh said it's his way of giving the man credit. \nThe 16-year-old said he was drawn in to drama and music, but didn't embrace it at first because he worried he wouldn't fit in. \"It wasn't the coolest thing,\" he said.
