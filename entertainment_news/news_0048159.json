Anyone whose footage is included will be listed as \"co-director,\" a press release from Google Inc. said.\nScott, who will serve as an executive producer with Kashyap, said it did not matter how small or personal the footage was — from riding a bike to calling your mum. \"It just simply needs to bear witness to what life is like in today's India — that's magical enough,\" he said.\nMehta, a Canadian filmmaker who directed \"I'll Follow You Down,\" said the project was so personal to him that he believed that film was a perfect way to showcase what makes India \"so extraordinary and dispel its myths.\"\nIndian filmmakers R. Balki, Shekhar Kapur and Zoya Akhtar will serve as creative consultants.\n\"Tell us what you love, what you hate, what worries you, what you hope for, what you want to change,\" said Kashyap.\nArts & Entertainment Movies Anurag Kashyap Google Richie Mehta Ridley Scott India", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:21:17.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
