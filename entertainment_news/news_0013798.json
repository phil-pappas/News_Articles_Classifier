But on Tuesday, October 13, the two were spotted holding hands in LA as they reunited days after his very public arrest in Texas. The seemingly on-again couple stepped out to grab coffee and never let go of the other's hand even as they each carried a cup of the hot brew. 22-year-old Mia was seen to be still wearing the large diamond ring, which she was first spotted sporting on her left hand finger in the spring. Mia and Shia, who were believed to get engaged in March, opted to wear casual outfits during the outing. She wore a tiny black tank top and low-slung floral pants that exposed her bare midriff, while the 29-year-old actor wore a Harley Davidson t-shirt and brown shorts that were cut above the knee and revealed his lower thigh tattoos. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:24:12.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
