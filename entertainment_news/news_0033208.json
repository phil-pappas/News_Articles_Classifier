By Indo-Asian News Service on October 23, 2015 at 5:27 AM Comments \nThe US dollar increased against most major currencies as investors were digesting better-than-expected jobless data from the country as well as the outcome of just-ended European Central Bank (ECB) meeting. \nIn late New York trading on Thursday, the euro fell to $1.1112 from $1.1337 in the previous session, while the dollar bought 120.71 Japanese yen, higher than 119.95 yen of the previous session, Xinhua reported. \nThe rupee ended marginally lower by one paise to 64.75 against the American currency on mild dollar demand from banks and importers. The domestic currency opened lower at 64.82 per dollar as against Fridayâ€™s closing level of 64.74 at the Interbank Foreign Exchange market on initial dollar demand from banks and importers. \nLater, it gained on dollar selling by exporters to Rs 64.69 before concluding at 64.75 per dollar, showing a mere loss of one paise or 0.02 per cent. The domestic unit hovered in a range of 64.88 and 64.69 per dollar during the day.
