The publisher said Wednesday the series will have three chapter books; the first is scheduled for January 2017. The work is currently untitled.\nPlay Video Entertainment What it's like to star in \"Annie\" Quvenzhane Wallis tells CBS News about the upcoming \"Annie\" reboot and what she wants to be when she grows up.\n\"Reading is very important,\" Wallis, whose other films include \"Annie\" and \"12 Years a Slave,\" said in a statement issued through her publisher. \"It allows people to form a visual experience in their minds of what is going on in the story. I hope all readers enjoy using their imaginations along with me and take a journey into my books.\"\nBoth the series and the picture book should remind readers of the actress herself, now 12. The series features a \"precocious and talented\" third grader with star potential; the picture book will have a \"spunky young heroine\" anxious to attend an awards show.\nWallis will have a co-writer, still to be determined, for the chapter books. Illustrators for her picture book and chapter series also have yet to be chosen.\nWallis will be among the youngest authors in years. Last decade, pre-teen Mattie J.T. Stepanek wrote several best-selling poetry books.", "external_links": ["http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/10/20/9701a033-23ac-460e-81da-6d60ea1f7a20/thumbnail/220x140/89f1233b26ad1a8b84056660598de9d8/ent101514qwfinal297168640x360.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T01:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:04:03.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
