Known for their indie pop, the Glasgow-based sextet formed in 1996 and has released nine albums to date. During the last almost two decades, they have toured the world continually growing stronger as a live act and gaining a cult following around the world along the way.

They debuted in the city in 2001 as part of the Free Jazz Festival lineup and returned in 2010 to perform in Lapa’s Circo Voador, arriving at that time also with the help Queremos. \nFounded shortly before that show in 2010, Queremos has aided in bringing more than eighty shows to the country during the past five years. Following a Miike Snow concert in Circo Voador during September of 2010, the Belle and Sebastian concert marked the organization’s second successful show in Rio de Janeiro. \nStuart Murdoch and Stuart David had created Belle and Sebastian fourteen years earlier in 1996. First releasing demos and singles, they caught the attention of producers and would go on to release of their debut album, Tigermilk in 1996. Following its release, the two officially enlisted additional members and turned the group into a full-time project. \nWhile the reception of Tigermilk had been warm, it was the release of 1996’s If You’re Feeling Sinister that cemented Belle and Sebastian’s indie cult status. Praised for beautifully capturing moments of life and wrapping them in indie and baroque pop sounds with introspective lyrics, many critics have included the album in many of the best albums of the 90s lists. \nDuring the years that followed If You’re Feeling Sinister ‘s release, Belle and Sebastian released seven more studio albums including 1998’s The Boy with the Arab Strap ; 2000’s Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant ; 2002’s Storytelling ; 2003’s Dear Catastrophe Waitress 2006’s The Life Pursuit ; and 2010’s Belle and Sebastian Write About Love . \nAdditionally, as their reputation as a strong live act grew, they also released three live albums including The BBC Sessions , which featured their songs from the beginning in 1996 to 2001. \nDuring its almost twenty-year history, Belle and Sebastian has faced record label changes and lineup changes. Current members are Stuart Murdoch, Mick Cooke, Richard Colburn, Bobby Kildea, Chris Geddes, Stevie Jackson, and Sarah Martin. \nAs part of the concert on Friday, there will be an after-show party with the Manie Gang, the resident DJ Crew of the Manie Dansante parties, spinning live. While the DJs are known for their mixes of electro-swing, swing and retro beats, the parties are also known for guest performers including jugglers, clowns, contortionists and acrobats and Lindy Hop Dancers. \nBelle and Sebastian will go on play in São Paulo’s Audio Club on Saturday, October 17th, as part of the Popload Festival lineup.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T21:00:50.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
