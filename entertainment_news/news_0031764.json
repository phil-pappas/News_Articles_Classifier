County Walk to Defeat ALS. \nMiley Cyrus was more than happy to spread positive vibes at the 13th Annual L.A. County Walk to Defeat ALS on Sunday morning, October 18. The \"Wrecking Ball\" hitmaker made a surprise appearance at the charity event aimed to benefit people living with the disease across the nation. The 22-year-old singer joined Mari Winsor, a celebrity Pilates instructor who is battling the disease, onstage to lead a warm-up session for the 2,000 participants. \"I'm already sweating,\" Miley told E! News, before gushing over her pal Mari. \"She had us doing a happy warm-up and she kicked my a** once again. She's done it for years and she's already done it this morning and it's only 11!\" Reese Witherspoon also participated in the event to support her publicist friend Nanci Ryder who was diagnosed with ALS two years ago. \"I'm just happy to be here supporting Nanci but also just raising awareness and raising money for ALS,\" she said. \"There's so much that's not known about this disease and watching our friend progress every single week with something different and not know is so horrible... It's time that we start doing something to create a cure.\" Foto kiriman Reese Witherspoon (@reesewitherspoon) pada Okt 18, 2015 pada 1:03 PDT Other celebrities in attendance included Renee Zellweger with her musician boyfriend Doyle Bramhall II, Courteney Cox , Angie Harmon , Daphne Zuniga and Justine Bateman .
