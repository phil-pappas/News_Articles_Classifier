Whereas earlier historians limited their writings to detailed accounts of Indian raids and massacres in chronological order, Dekker’s book explains the underlying causes of two centuries of conflict, deprivation, and suffering: the ongoing conflict between the French and British for control of Maine; friction between the Massachusetts government and the Scotch Irish settlers in our immediate area; and the no-win situation of the Indians who were being displaced from their lands. \nDekker gives more attention to the problems faced by the Indians and gives them gentler treatment than have earlier writers; and he explains much of what is now known about their political organization and culture. Dekker traces his interests in the 18th century to his time at Thomaston Grammar School, when he learned that Thomaston was once the frontier of British settlement in the 1700s. \nDekker has had a lifelong passion for 18th-century American history and material culture, and he presents educational programs for local historical societies, state historic sites and the public. Portraying Maine soldiers of the French and Indian War and the American Revolution as a living historian, he endeavors to relate the stories of forgotten individuals and their world. He teaches at Spurwink School in Brunswick and resides in Dresden. \nEveryone is invited to attend what should be an exceptionally interesting program. Dekker has been asked to bring copies of his book for sale. The program will be preceded by a 6:30 p.m. potluck supper; the public is invited to both supper and program. There is no charge, but a collection will be taken. For more information, call James Skoglund at 372-8893. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
