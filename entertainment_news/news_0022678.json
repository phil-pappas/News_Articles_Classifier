Fox's Marty McFly and Christopher Lloyd's Doc Brown traveled forward in time in Back to the Future Part II . Their mission was to prevent Marty's future son from landing in trouble with Biff Tannen's grandson, Griff. They succeeded, albeit with unintended consequences. \nThe sequel, released in 1989, made several memorable predictions about what life would be like in the year 2015. Unfortunately, some were off the mark, like the existence of flying cars or the type of hoverboard that Marty rode while being chased by Griff and his gang. \nHowever, Back to the Future Part II screenwriter Bob Gale points out that his film's version of the future was accurate in some respects. \n\"We got the fingerprint technology right, the biometrics. The voice-activated stuff, [the] Skype call that Marty makes with Needles and all the data that's going by, it's kind of like Facebook,\" he told ABC Radio. \nIn the version of 2015 depicted in the film, Gale added, \"[Marty's] kids are wearing something like Google Glasses,\" and Marty's son has the ability to simultaneously watch multiple TV channels. \nOne prediction from the movie that has received a lot of attention lately: the Chicago Cubs winning the World Series. When he included the gag in the film, Gale said, he thought there would be \"zero\" chance that the Cubs -- a team that hasn't won a championship since 1908 -- would actually go all the way in the year 2015. \nBut lo and behold, the Cubs are currently playing in the National League Championship Series against the New York Mets. (Their World Series chances are now bleak, however, with the Mets currently holding a three-games-to-none lead in the best-of-seven series after last night's game.) \nAs it happens, Gale is a fan of the St. Louis Cardinals, the Cubs' chief rival. Though the Cardinals were eliminated from the playoffs by the Cubs earlier this month, Gale wouldn't mind seeing the Cubs win the World Series, just as his film anticipated. \n\"Look, everybody knows that the Cubs never get there. Particularly if you're a Cardinals fan, you know that. And now they might get there, and I certainly will be rooting for them,\" he said before the Cubs' series with the Mets began. \nMichael Klastorin, the production publicist for the second and third Back to the Future movies, and the author of the new book Back to the Future: The Ultimate Visual History , explained to ABC Radio the intention for Part II wasn't to predict the future, but rather to deliver a fun story. \n\"Some of the things were natural extensions of the time period [when Back to the Future Part II was made],\" he said. \"And you say, OK, in 1989 what's nostalgic right now? Those would be '50s cafes. So in 30 years, the '80s will be a place of nostalgia, so we'll do the Cafe 80's.\" \nA new documentary on the Back to the Future trilogy, Back In Time , will premiere digitally and on Netflix today to coincide with Marty and Doc's 2015 adventure. It includes interviews with Fox, Lloyd, co-star Lea Thompson, Gale, and others who were involved with the original film -- which is celebrating its 30-year anniversary -- and its sequels. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
