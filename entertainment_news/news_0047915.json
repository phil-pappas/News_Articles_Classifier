There are no blackout dates, meaning the pass can be used 365 days a year. \nThe Gold Pass and above also includes free parking and free downloads from the photo-taking service Disney PhotoPass. \nA single-day, non-Magic Kingdom base ticket is $97 for ages 10 and up. But the daily cost comes down depending on length of stay. \nThe cost of a Magic Kingdom one-day base ticket is $105 a person. \nAs for Disneyland, on the West Coast, one annual pass introduced Sunday will cost more than $1,000 per person, but that pass will allow visitors to go to Disneyland and California Adventure on any day of the year with no blackout dates, The Los Angeles Times reported. \nA Premium Pass, which cost $779, has been discontinued. \nThe new Signature Plus Pass also includes parking and unlimited PhotoPass downloads for $1,049, the Times reported. \nA Signature Pass was also announced and costs $849, but it has two weeks of blackout days during the Christmas to New Year holiday time, Disney spokeswoman Suzi Brown told the Times . \nThe park's other passes increased from 9 to 31 percent. Some will only be permitted to be renewed, not purchased new. \nThe price increases come two months after Disney officials announced major construction projects, in both Florida and Los Angeles, related to the new Star Wars films, the Times reported.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T20:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:29:49.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
