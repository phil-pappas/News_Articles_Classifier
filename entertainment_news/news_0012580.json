The tour provides complimentary rides for 24-cities over 12-months; a new city every other week ET | Source: BeMyDD photo-release \nLOS ANGELES, Oct. 12,   BeMyDD (Be My Designated Driver), the nation's largest designated driver service, today announced it will be offering free designated drivers to residents of Tampa on Saturday, November 7th to get them and their cars home safely. The 24-City Designated Driver Tour, presented by BeMyDD and program partners Jack Daniel's Gentleman Jack Whiskey and Total Wine & More, provides free drivers to take both the customer and his/her car home safely. During the event, customers can request a car pickup at no charge from any location within a 50-mile radius from the city center with the BeMyDD smartphone app, available for iOS and Android devices. A team of drivers will arrive at the customer's location, one to drive the customer and their car home safely, and the other to retrieve the driver afterwards. The program continues a long-term initiative from BeMyDD to lower the rate of drunk driving deaths and promote social responsibility throughout the 76 markets it serves. \"Social responsibility is a huge priority for us\" said Arthur Simanovsky, BeMyDD president and CEO. \"We're always looking for ways to make finding a designated driver easier than getting behind the wheel. The 24-City Designated Driver Tour is our biggest opportunity yet to positively impact communities all over the United States, and we are excited to make Tampa, and the rest of West Florida an important stop on our tour across the country.\" According to statistics from the U.S. Department of Transportation, a drunk driver kills someone every 52 minutes. Targeted specifically for people in the suburbs, for whom taxi rides downtown can quickly get expensive, BeMyDD aims to give consumers an affordable and safe transportation alternative by using the customer's own vehicle. Fully-screened and insured drivers with over 10 years of professional experience are available on demand for a variety of driving services, including event transportation and hourly personal drivers. In addition to the potential lives saved through the use of designated drivers, services like BeMyDD also help avoid the expense of getting a DUI, which can cost around $16,000, according to AAA. \"The 24-City Designated Driver Tour is an excellent opportunity to promote responsible consumer enjoyment, which is one of our core brand values,\" said Rob Frederick, Director of corporate responsibility at Jack Daniel's parent corporation Brown-Forman. \"This is a unique campaign that has our full support.\" Likewise, Matt Indre, Senior Manager of Public Affairs & Corporate Responsibility at Total Wine & More, points out the program's potential for having a positive impact. \"We strive to be a responsible corporate citizen and make a difference in our communities through our corporate philanthropy and social responsibility programs,\" he says. \"We are committed to responsible enjoyment of alcohol and the 24-City Designated Driver Tour supports that goal.\" Tampa residents can learn more about the program, see the other cities on the tour schedule, and read instructions for receiving free car pickup on November 7, 2015 by visiting www.BeMyDD.com/DDTour . Free pickup service will be available between the hours of 9 p.m. and 2 a.m. on the specified date and will be offered on a first-come, first-served basis. As an added bonus, new customers anywhere in the country can get $20 off their first ride on any day by using promo code DDTOUR through the BeMyDD mobile app. About BeMyDD BeMyDD (Be My Designated Driver) is the nation's largest designated driver service, currently operating in 76 markets in 31 states.
