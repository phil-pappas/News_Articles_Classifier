In a vacuum oven, the thermal process occurs in a chamber where the atmospheric pressure is lowered using a vacuum pump and the unit can achieve temperatures of up to 2,500Â°C. The underlying principle of the vacuum oven is that at a reduced pressure (25-100 mm Hg), the temperature drops leading to vaporization of water leading to more efficient drying in comparison to a conventional oven. The oven is used for a wide range of purposes such as electroplating, desiccating, vacuum embedding, dry sterilization, outgassing liquids, and electronic component processing.\nTechnavio's analysts forecast the global vacuum ovens market to grow at a CAGR of 7.59% over the period 2014-2019.\nCovered in this report\nIn this report, Technavio covers the present scenario and growth prospects of the global vacuum ovens market for the period 2015-2019.
