Red and black were the big statement colours – but some of the outfits had better things to say than others. \nHere are 11 of the best and the worst dressed: 1. Worst – Justin Bieber Justin Bieber at the MTV EMA Awards (Yui Mok/PA) \nRed is a great colour, there’s no denying it – but it’s also the colour for “stop”, as in –“stop with the head-to-ankle colour coordination, please, Justin”. 2. Best – Jason Derulo Jason Derulo and guests at the MTV EMA Awards (Yui Mok/PA) \nIt may have been dark outside, but Jason unapologetically kept his shades on – along with a stylish fur-collar jacket. 3. Worst – Ellie Goulding Ellie Goulding at the MTV EMA Awards (Antonio Calanni/AP) \nEllie just looked really awkward and uncomfortable in this dress, and we’re not super-keen on the new hairdo either. 4. Best – Jess Glynne Jess Glynne at the MTV EMA Awards (Yui Mok/PA) \nOkay, after what we said about Justin’s outfit, we have to admit – head-to-toe red can really work, if you get it right. 5. Worst – Mark Ronson and Josephine de la Baume Mark Ronson and Josephine de la Baume at the MTV EMA Awards (Antonio Calanni/AP) \nA matching shiny black satin dress and suit? Couple-dressing at its worst. 6. Best – Eric Nally, Macklemore and Ryan Lewis Eric Nally, Macklemore and Ryan Lewis at the MTV EMA Awards (Yui Mok/PA) \nTop marks really go to Macklemore, with a classic grey woollen overcoat. 7. Worst – Ruby Rose Ruby Rose at the MTV EMA Awards (Yui Mok/PA) \nFlattering in some parts and not-so-much in others, this red carpet look for the co-host just didn’t quite work. 8. Best – Talia Storm Talia Storm at the MTV EMA Awards (Yui Mok/PA) \nIt’s hard to pull off Jedward-style hair, but this who look was so weird it was actually wonderful. 9. Worst – Martin Garrix Martin Garrix at the MTV EMA Awards (Yui Mok/PA) \nWe’re not sure if the electronic music star arrived on a motorbike and just didn’t have time to change? 10. Best – Laura Whitmore Laura Whitmore at the MTV EMA Awards (Yui Mok/PA) \nThe TV presenter really pulled off this long-sleeved mini-dress – which was set off with bright blue shoes. 11. Neutral – Ed Sheeran Ed Sheeran at the MTV EMA Awards (Yui Mok/PA) Share article \nThis is so inoffensive it’s hard to call Ed one of the best-dressed, but he was still looking fairly smart. Good one Ed. Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T23:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:54:25.126+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
