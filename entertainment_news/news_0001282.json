(What, just me?) \nCabo earned a four-chair turnaround with his assured, pitch-perfect take on Whitesnake's '80s classic \"Here I Go Again,\" and won the backing of coach Adam Levine. \"Hearing you sing the crap out of that song ignites me, because that's where I come from,\" the Maroon 5 frontman told Cabo. \nCabo is the only New Jersey singer to make it through the blind auditions of \"The Voice,\" which has elevated several Garden States singers over the years, including Matt McAndrew of Barnegat Light (runner-up), Christina Grimmie of Marlton (third place) and Jacquie Lee of Colts Neck (runner-up). The battle rounds begin tonight at 8 p.m. on NBC. \nIn an interview with NJ Advance Media, Cabo says his age was never a factor with \"The Voice\" producers. \"They embraced me and they took me in wholeheartedly, they didn't question me. They didn't hesitate to say, 'You have the talent, period. That's where it ended.\" \nCabo makes a living as a fashion photographer and has his own line of T-shirts but has been singing on and off since his 20s, when he was invited to hear a band at Old Bridge's now-defunct Birch Hill Nite Club; the band was looking to replace its frontman. He played with them for about three years, and their big break was supposed to be a heavily promoted concert in New York â€” scheduled for the night of Sept. 11, 2001. The concert never happened. \n\"That was kind of a moment, it was a wake-up call for me,\" Cabo says. \"As much as I love music, there are other things in this world.\" \nHe took a break from music but eventually returned and currently plays in the cover band Ultrafuze , although his personal tastes range from Justin Timberlake to Cee Lo to Bon Jovi. (During our conversation, he obliged us with an impassioned verse of \"Wanted Dead or Alive\"). \nAn '80s boy who loves his hair bands (though he no longer has the hair), Cabo says \"Here I Go Again\" has special meaning for him. \"I've gotten beat up so many times. I've fallen on my face but I've gotten back up again, and here I go again, trying one more time at the age of 45.\" \nAnd since his performance, he says many people his age have reached out to him. \"If I had a dollar for every text that I got or every message, 'Dude, because of you, I picked up my guitar, I called my friends, \"Let's start jamming out.\"' I inspired these people to just reinvent the wheel for themselves and just ignited and rekindled a flame that died a long time ago.\" \nYou can listen to Cabo's interview on TV Hangover , NJ.com's new television podcast with TV critic Vicki Hyman and TV super fan Erin Medley right here: TV HANGOVER, EP. 4: 'The Leftovers' returns, 'Quantico' soars and Vicki interviews 'The Voice' contestant NJ.com TV critic Vicki Hyman and super fan Erin Medley agree to hate \"Dr. Ken\" but are divided on drama \"Quantico.\" New Jersey's Manny Cabo talks about wowing judges on NBC's \"The Voice.\" Subscribe to the podcast on iTunes or Stitcher . \nVicki Hyman may be reached at vhyman@njadvancemedia.com .
