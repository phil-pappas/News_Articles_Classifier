Related Items Cars For Sale \nCATE Blanchett thinks selfies are \"pathetic\" and says social media \"sets up rivalry and jealousy\". \nThe 46-year-old actress isn't a fan of the photo sharing app Instagram and thinks too many of people worry \"about what other people are going to think\" about their appearance. \nThe Cinderella star said: \"People constantly are taking pictures of ourselves to send them to people to see if they like me, 'Do they like me?' \n\"It's pathetic, the whole thing about people worrying about what other people are going to think. I just can't handle it. \n\"Of course you want people to go see the film that you make, of course you want them to enjoy them. But I'm not out there saying, 'Do they like the way I look?'... You have to say, 'This is what I'm doing right now.'\" \nThe Oscar winner also doesn't understand why people use other forms of social media, such as Twitter and Facebook, because she believes it \"sets up rivalry and jealousy\". \nShe told Yahoo! Beauty: \"It's this huge thing. 'Like me! Like me!' The like and the dislike is just totally primary schoolyard. I cannot for the life of me work out why adults are participating in that s**t.\" \nBut the Oscar winner admits \"there is so much great stuff on social media\" in terms of entertainment. \nShe said: \"There's a subversive quality to the Internet, and I do think there's a genuine ability to connect. \n\"But the downside with social media is it divides people really quickly and sets up rivalry and jealousy and a sense of the life over there is better than the life over here.\" cate blanchett", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:23:30.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
