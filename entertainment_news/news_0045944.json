And she doesn't like to wash her hands after going to the bathroom. I'm going to leave that one alone.\n But this video is really all about the marshmallows. Taking a dare, Jennifer guesses she can fit about eight of the gooey treats in her mouth. I'm already a little nauseous thinking about that. She manages to get A LOT of marshmallows into her mouth and then (of course) shares a story about how it reminded her of an embarrassing dating experience.\nBless you, J-Law and your enviable marshmallow game.\nMore From Cosmopolitan\n​Follow Rebecca on Instagram .", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/rebeccaburtrose/", "http://www.mtv.com/news/2284824/hunger-games-camp-mockingjay-jennifer-lawrence-marshmallows/"], "published": "2015-10-02T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:53:02.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
