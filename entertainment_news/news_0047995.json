The Chicago Tribune reports ( http://trib.in/1PYAsf6 ) that Friends of the Parks' filing Friday focuses on a ground lease agreement that the Chicago Park District has signed with the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art. The agreement gives the Lucas museum a 99-year lease on the lakefront property for $10. A judge ordered the group to file an amended complaint because the museum recently released revised plans that include more green space and a scaled-back design. Mayor Rahm Emanuel offered the land along Lake Michigan for the project to the \"Star Wars\" creator, who chose to build in Chicago over San Francisco.
