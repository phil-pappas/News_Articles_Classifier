Such was the inexplicable nature of the error that the action appeared to descend into slow motion as Williams watched the ball drop over the line and into the net, her desperate dive to clear the ball in vain.\nBlackburn’s 11th minute goal doubled a lead already held by the home side thanks to Tameka Butt’s eighth minute strike. Canberra was never able to overturn the two goal deficit, with Michelle Heyman’s 39th minute effort salvaging some pride for the visitors.\nThe 2-1 scoreline means Brisbane shares top spot on the W-League ladder with fellow round one winners Perth Glory, with Sydney FC and Melbourne City still to face off on the opening weekend.\nOther Stories Awesome All Blacks lay Cardiff ghosts to rest Rugby 0 comments Will Geoffrey ever find love again?
