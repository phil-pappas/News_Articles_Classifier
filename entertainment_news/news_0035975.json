The song has peppy beats with the sound of guitar, drums along with mild kuthu interludes. There's also something for Kamal fans in the song, patched interestingly by Imman, who has become a pro in this. Aanaalum Indha Mayakkam is a lilting melody effortlessly rendered by Sathya Prakash. The rhythmic pattern of the song has been well composed, but despite the Hindi-chorus in the second charanam which distracts the listener, the song sustains its melodic quality.\nThis is followed by the racy title track by Vishal Dadlani and Emcee Jesz. The song is full of vigorous beats, which is the trend in Kollywood right now. With stylish singing by Vishal and rap by Emcee Jesz, this one works well with the theme of the film. The song's female version, rendered by Vaikom Vijayalakshmi, is more likeable though. Her singing is not too slow or fast, and the song, too, moves at a steady pace. Gaana Gaana , an item number, is rendered by Shreya Ghoshal and Anand Aravindakshan. Starting stylishly with jazz by Anand, Shreya then takes over to bring the kuthu element rendering it in her style. What's interesting is that it doesn't follow the stereotypical item number format as Imman has experimented quite a bit in this number. But that doesn't really make the song any better. Clearly, this album is not in the typical Imman format.
