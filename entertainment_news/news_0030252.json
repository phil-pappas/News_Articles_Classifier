This working orchard is only one of a few in the area that is certified organic by the USDA. Approximately 6000 trees produce about 115,000 pounds of fruit each season. 65% of the trees are mature and producing fruit. The other 35% will be producing fruit in 1-2 years, which will significantly increase production. The harvest is wholesaled to popular retail stores, and is also sold at farmer's markets, special events, fundraisers, and at a free-standing retail store on the property. All of the buildings are about six years old, including a beautiful 2014 sq. ft. home, corral, packing shed, and storage facility. There is also a separate bunkhouse/office with its own bathroom. Installing a kitchen would be simple and then the facility could be rented out for additional income. The real estate was appraised at $980k during the recession of 2009. There are many financing options available for this opportunity. We believe this business would make an excellent acquisition for an industry buyer, a microbrewery, a winery, or an entrepreneur looking for a start-up business in the Rocky Mountains.
