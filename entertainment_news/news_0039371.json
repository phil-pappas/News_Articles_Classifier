You have a place on your official website for suggestions!\" Stephen laughed. \n\"I genuinely did not know we had a website,\" John admitted. \nThat's right, when Stephen asked John if he would ever cover topics from the viewers' suggestion section of his official website, he admitted he didn't even know he had a website at all. (Video via HBO / \"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver\" ) \nFor instance, take this Leap Second Countdown Clock that automatically wastes a second of your time with a randomly generated, one-second video. Amazing. \nFortunately, John's interview with Stephen definitely wasn't a waste of time. \nViewers at home loved seeing the two back together again, calling the show \"fantastic\" and \"the most awesome thing.\" \nHere's to hoping we see a lot more of them in the future! And that John learns how to use the Internet. \nThis video includes images from Getty Images.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T08:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T11:30:03.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
