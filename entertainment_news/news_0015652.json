Contributed Cars For Sale \nAS ONE domino falls, the rest will follow. \nThat's the idea behind Rockhampton filmmaker Ian Westley's latest short film titled Dominoes, which will premiere at a private screening in town tomorrow night(no tickets are available to the public). \nStarring three local actors, Ian describes the film as a heist flick, about a bank robbery gone wrong. \n\"It's about three guys who've committed a robbery but you never find out what they've taken,\" Ian told Pulse yesterday. \n\"One of them is late getting to the job and as a result it all goes wrong and they end up hiding out in an old paint shop trying to figure out what their next move is.\" \nAlso a performer and part of the local performing arts scene in CQ since 2004, Ian said he'd made eight or nine short films so far. \n\"This one is by far my best work from a technical point of view,\" he said. \n\"I used special effects that I've never done before and invested quite heavily in a really good audio system and I had a really great team working around me. \n\"I love it (the filming process) from start to finish. I've got to the point now where I have to be either in front of the camera or behind it, I can't do both, so it's a lot less stressful.\" \nIan said the premiere would also feature work by other local filmmakers including Dean Netherwood and TJ Wickham. \n\"That's why we do it,\" he said about including locals in his filmmaking process. \n\"We all get together and only want to use local people and the fantastic locations around Rocky and the Coast.\" \nThe film stars local performers Tony Doak, Dean Netherwood and Christos Aristidou. \nMORE INFO \nFor more information, find Blue Eagle Productions (CQ) and CQ Encompass Art Productions on Facebook film", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:22:47.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
