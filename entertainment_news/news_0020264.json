To build the anticipation for the Halloween event, FOX has released the first trailer for the said special. It appears that Ichabod Crane's ( Tom Mison ) outfit will attract a lot of attention from the Jeffersonian team. \"[Is] there a cosplay competition going on?\" Hodgins (T. J. Thyne) asks Crane, who isn't too happy with the remark. Booth ( David Boreanaz ) also can't help commenting on Crane's vintage coat as he says, \"Nice coat.\" Together with their respective partners, Brennan ( Emily Deschanel ) and Abbie ( Nicole Beharie ), Booth and Crane team up to solve a case following the discovery of human remains that leads to the return of one of Crane's enemies. During their investigation, Brennan and Crane are trapped in a place which is full of ancient stuff. The 2-episode crossover airs Thursday, October 29 starting at 8 P.M. on FOX with a \"Bones\" episode. In it, \"a case involving a 200-year-old headless corpse gets some help from Ichabod Crane and FBI agent Abbie Mills, who travel from Sleepy Hollow to claim the body but wonder what it has to do with a contemporary murder victim. Meanwhile, Brennan and Booth surprise each other with Halloween pranks.\" It's followed by a \"Sleepy Hollow\" episode at 9 P.M. The story will see the FBI being flummoxed by a strange death, but Abbie and Ichabod search for supernatural reasons to make their case to Dr. Temperance \"Bones\" Brennan and Agent Seeley Booth. Meanwhile, Pandora ( Shannyn Sossamon ) resurrects a British general, and the town is threatened by an army of undead soldiers. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:06:03.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
