USA Today pays tribute... \nMusic fans eager for news about Adele's long-awaited third album, reportedly due by the end of the year, got a surprise update Wednesday from the reclusive British singer herself. \nIn a personal statement posted on her official social media accounts , Adele hinted that the album, apparently titled \"25,\" will explore her journey to adulthood and self-acceptance. \n\"My last record was a break-up record and if I had to label this one I would call it a make-up record,\" she said. \"I'm making up with myself. Making up for lost time. Making up with everything I ever did and never did.\" \nThe singer also offered an apology of sorts for the delay in readying the new album, which has been rumored to be coming, oh, any time now since about 2013. \n\"25 is about getting to know who I've become without realizing,\" she said. \"And I'm sorry it took so long, but you know, life happened.\" \nReleased in early 2011, Adele's sophomore album, \"21,\" sold more than 11 million copies in the U.S. alone and is the biggest-selling record this decade. The album swept the 2012 Grammy Awards, winning album of the year and song of the year for \"Rolling in the Deep.\" \nSince then, Adele, 27, has kept a low profile, giving birth to a son with businessman Simon Konecki in 2012 and resurfacing for occasional projects such as the theme song to the James Bond movie \"Skyfall,\" which won her an Oscar. \nBut now it appears the publicity machine for \"25\" is gearing up. Wednesday's statement followed a teaser promo, likely for for a new Adele song, that aired last weekend on British TV.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T18:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:33:40.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
