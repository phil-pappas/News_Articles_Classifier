Her new single, \"Focus,\" drops Oct. 30, and she's promoting her new fragrance, Ari. So, naturally, her makeup artist Daniel Chinchilla couldn't be working much harder, creating that winged eye that has become a Grande signature. \"The whole '60s mod look is her vibe,\" Chinchilla said. \"Obviously for the stage, we go a little heavier.\" For everyday beauty, though, he shared some tricks from his makeup kit before his 11 a.m. call time Friday with Grande.\nQ: For women in their 20s, often the cheekbones haven't emerged from the fullness of youth. Is there a way to create some angles?\nA: It doesn't have to do with age necessarily; anyone at any age can have a rounder face. That's why contouring has become such a big thing, but it's also become such an impossible thing to do for the everyday girl because they look at these tutorials on Instagram and say why would I ever put this much makeup on my face? It's funny because all you really need is some bronzer and a blush brush. You carve out cheekbones by going right under the hollows of the cheeks; you start at the temples and blend down toward the corner of your mouth, not all the way, and obviously if you smile it's easier because you can see the cheeks better. It's a lot more foolproof than videos where they tell you to put a really dark cream foundation around the face and in the hollows, then put a light foundation on the cheeks and blend it all together. That becomes such an ordeal.\nQ: Are there bronzers and brushes you like?\nA: I love the Too Faced powder bronzers ($30, ulta.com ). A lot of bronzers have a really saturated orangey look to them, whereas these are very neutral, browny and warm. For the everyday girl, a powder would be easier to blend than a cream. I like a tapered blush brush from Real Techniques; it's pretty inexpensive ($8.99 at ulta.com) and really great quality. You want to put the bronzer on a smaller blush brush as opposed to a bigger powder brush.\nQ: Do you add blush after the bronzer?\n'Scream Queens' Steve Dietl / AP Ariana Grande, from left, Emma Roberts, Abigail Breslin and Billie Lourd appear in a scene from \"Scream Queens\".\nAriana Grande, from left, Emma Roberts, Abigail Breslin and Billie Lourd appear in a scene from \"Scream Queens\".\n(Steve Dietl / AP) A: Yes, if you do a powder contour, do a powder blush. I love Urban Decay's ($26-$32, ulta.com). There's also a great NARS blush called Orgasm ($30, narscosmetics.com ). Literally anyone can wear it. Do the contour in the hollows, then the blush you do the opposite — on the apples of cheeks and up toward the temples — go in the opposite direction. Adding a pop of color on the cheeks gives you a bit of dimension.\nQ: You also have done the makeup of Betty White. How do the steps change if you're older and you're facing different challenges?\nA: For more mature skin, in general, I always say less is more. Stay away from any matte foundation; go with something a little more luminous and hydrating. Stick with matte colors for the eyeshadow; anything shimmery will accentuate fine lines. Black mascara and a little bit of brown eyeliner — those are the essentials to wake your eyes up. And maybe a bit of cream blush, as long as you know how to blend it. The warmth of the fingertips will warm the product and make it blend better. Put it on the apples of the cheeks, then in little patting strokes buff it into the skin, little by little. Rushing is how you mess up. Like my mom, she grabs her lipstick in the car and slaps it on her cheeks. I say, Mom, that's fine, but calm down. Little by little. As long as you do baby steps you're not going to go too far.\nWinged eye Marion Curtis / AP Ariana Grande performs during an appearance at Macy's Herald Square showcasing her new fragrance, Ari by Ariana Grande.\nAriana Grande performs during an appearance at Macy's Herald Square showcasing her new fragrance, Ari by Ariana Grande.\n(Marion Curtis / AP) Q: Do you have favorites for foundation, and do you use primer?\nA: I love the Too Faced Born this Way foundation ($39, ulta.com). It looks like skin, it gives a really nice glow. For someone with more oily skin, I love Tarte Amazonian Clay foundation ($39, ulta.com). Priming is very underrated, and honestly, I was five years into my career before I used primers. I thought, wow, I can't believe I didn't use them. They keep makeup on and give you such a firmer finish. I love Smashbox primers ($16-$42, ulta.com); they have several for different skin types, which I think is super important. Also for eye shadow, you need a primer. Urban Decay has an amazing primer, called Eyeshadow Potion ($13-$24, ulta.com). It's great for controlling the oily lid thing, which makes shadow slide off and eyeliner and mascara smudge. Even if you don't wear shadow, put on a little primer to control the oil.\nQ: Powder on top of foundation always?\nA: For the most part, but someone with more mature skin, you might find the perfect foundation and not need powder. For someone who has more oil in the skin, Maybelline has a translucent powder that I love. And their Fit Me pressed powders ($7.99, ulta.com) have such a nice smooth finish, not cakey.\nQ: Beyond the cat-eye, Ariana's brows are straighter than when she first came on the scene with Nickelodeon. How does someone achieve that shape?\nA: The arched thing was big for a while — everyone had to have the perfect arch — then you started to see the straight brow. She saw it and liked it. It became a really big trend, not because of her, but in general. It's kind of a rule for me that if you need to fill in or create a shape, start with a pencil, create the shape, then fill it in with a little powder to soften it up. If you have fuller brows, skip the pencil and just use a powder to fill in, because a pencil can go harsh. And go lighter than your hair. I have black brows; I would use a dark or medium brown. You want to create shape but soften also. It sounds like a contradiction, but there's a way to create shape without looking harsh.\nQ: Any mascara preferences?\nA: I have two. L'oreal Voluminous ($7.99) and Too Faced Better than Sex mascara ($23, ulta.com); they're both amazing. If you try those two you'll fall in love with at least one. I think always black. Lashes are the one thing that I feel you always can't have enough of; they open up the eyes.\nQ: How about adding lashes?\nA: It's tricky, but Ardell Demi Wispies ($9.99, ulta.com) are a makeup artist's tool. I haven't met anybody that these look bad on. The band is flexible, so they're easy to put on -- put a little glue on the band, give it 20 seconds to get sticky and put it as close as possible above the lashes, so they look like they're yours. They take a little bit of practice, so don't try it the day of the wedding. Start a week before. For somebody who has a really hard time putting lashes on, cut the strip in half, and just put it on at the outer corner. Or put on the outer and then the inner separately. It will be a lot easier.\nQ: Any go-to lipsticks?\nA: I love Maybelline Superstay 14 Hour lipsticks ($8.99, ulta.com); they last and are really creamy, and the pigments are amazing. NARS has a new line of matte colors that are amazing ($27, narscosmetics.com). For a really quick lipstick to slap on, Too Faced Melted lipsticks ($21, ulta.com) come in squeeze tubes; they're a liquid lipstick, but they stay on and are hydrating and really pretty colors.\nwdonahue@chicagotribune.com\nTwitter @wendy_donahue\n Nickelodeon (tv network)", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-560ed809/turbine/ct-apphoto-tv-fall-season-jpg-20151002", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560ed809/turbine/ct-apphoto-people-ariana-grande-jpg-20151002", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560ed808/turbine/sc-fash-1026-ariana-grande-makeup-artist-20151002"], "published": "2015-10-02T22:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:16:24.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
