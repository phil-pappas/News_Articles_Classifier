The Martha Stewart Living mogul recently agreed to sell her lifestyle company to Sequential Brands Group, whose brands include Ellen Tracy and Linens â€˜n Things, in a stock-and-cash deal worth $353 million. \nPhoto: Getty", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:52:23.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
