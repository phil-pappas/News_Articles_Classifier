Mobster offers inside look at Lufthansa 'Goodfellas' heist Associated Press | \nNEW YORK (AP) — The robbery crew that pulled off one of the biggest heists in U.S. history — the $6 million Lufthansa theft immortalized in \"Goodfellas\" — was elated at first but became fearful of being robbed itself, a turncoat mobster testified Tuesday at the trial of his former Mafia boss. \nThe defendant, Vincent Asaro, was \"very happy, really euphoric\" when he learned about the mountain of $100 bills scored in the armed holdup, Gaspare Valenti told a jury in Brooklyn federal court. \"We thought there was going to be $2 million in cash and there was $6 million.\" \nBut Valenti testified that the joy quickly evaporated when Asaro warned him, \"We've got to be real careful now. They'll look to rob us. They'll look to kill us. It could be anyone who hears of the score.\" \nThe testimony marked the first time Valenti has given his blow-by-blow account of the heist. Prosecutors say he voluntarily came forward in 2008, implicated Asaro and agreed to testify against him in violation of the Mafia's once-sacred vow of silence. \nAfter taking the witness stand Tuesday, Valenti, 68, was asked to point out Asaro in the courtroom and describe an article of clothing he was wearing — a blue V-neck sweater. He then described how he met the 80-year-old defendant in the 1960s and starting working for him as a devoted Bonanno organized crime family associate. \n\"I was very close with him. ... We had, like, a bond,\" he said. \nValenti testified that his involvement in the heist orchestrated by James \"Jimmy the Gent\" Burke — played by Robert De Niro in the movie — began when Asaro told him, \"Jimmy Burke has a big score at the airport coming up, and you're invited to go.\" \nThe plan called for Valenti and another robber to take a stolen black van to the airport terminal and use bolt cutters to break into a side entrance, he said. Once inside the terminal, they teamed up with other armed and masked bandits who were holding several workers hostage in a lunch room, he said. \nThe crew forced one of the workers to open a safe, where they discovered dozens of boxes containing packets holding $125,000 each, bags of gold chains and containers with precious gems that they threw into the van, he said. They then fled and rendezvoused with Asaro and Burke, who were in a car about a mile away, he said. \nAsked if the crew had an escape plan, Valenti responded, \"No. It's amazing — a robbery that big and nothing was discussed about where to go afterward.\" \nAsaro and Burke decided the haul should be put in the basement of Valenti's house in Brooklyn before it was moved to various stash houses, the witness said. Burke \"gave very little money out at the beginning,\" he said, and when he did, it was with a caveat: Don't spend it in a lavish way that would draw the attention of law enforcement. \nStill, he said, Asaro used it to buy a second home, a boat and a Bill Blass designer addition of a Lincoln Continental. Prosecutors have said Asaro also gambled away a big chunk of his $750,000 cut at the racetrack. \nThe defense has accused Valenti and other admitted mobsters expected to testify at the trial of framing Asaro to win leniency in their own cases. If convicted of racketeering conspiracy and other charges, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T21:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:25:59.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
