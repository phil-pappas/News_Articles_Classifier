Duran Duran with yet another award (Ian West/PA) \nDuran Duran, originally comprising Simon Le Bon, Nick Rhodes, John Taylor, Andy Taylor and Roger Taylor, released a statement about their accolade. \n“It is no coincidence that our rise was paralleled by the growth and ultimate world domination of MTV.

We are really proud to be the recipients of this new award. Thank you, MTV.” Promoted stories \nMeanwhile, a good deal of anticipation surrounds Justin Bieber’s forthcoming performance because he broke down in tears at the MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs) in August. \nThe Canadian pop star explained why he had been so overwhelmed on Jimmy Fallon’s The Tonight Show: “I just wasn’t expecting them to support me in the way they did. Last time I was at an awards show, I was booed.” \nAfter confirming his appearance at the EMAs, Justin said: “I’m excited to share this performance and this new material with my fans around the world. The EMAs are always a blast. I’m glad to be back and it’s going to be fun”. \nThe star is due to release his new album Purpose on November 13, the same date as One Direction’s much-anticipated fifth studio album, Made In The AM. Ed Sheeran ( Joel Ryan/Invision/PA) \nSinger Ed Sheeran and model Ruby Rose will host the EMAs, which promises an intriguing battle between Taylor Swift, who has nine nominations, and Justin who has scored six nods.
