They looked completely stressed out in their Monday workout, with the music blasting, rookie power hitter Kyle Schwarber dancing, and their entire batting practice Monday consisting of nothing more than guys standing around fielding bunts.\nGo ahead and think what you want, and they’ll quickly remind you they’ve won 101 games this season, and don’t plan on their season ending until they wind up with 109, sometime in early November.\nSure, they may be down 2-0 in the National League Championship to the New York Mets, and now have to face Mets ace Jacob deGrom on Tuesday night in Game 3 at Wrigley Field, but they appear as stressed out as a yoga instructor in Maui.\nUSA TODAY\nFor Cubs, facing Jacob de Grom not a totally hairy situation\n\"We’re not scared of anyone,\" Cubs veteran catcher David Ross said. \"This is a group that’s not afraid of losing, and doesn’t approach the day like that. They attack the day, attack the group.\n\"There’s no panic in the group. No panic in the manager. No panic in the organization. Nobody here is worried.\n\"We’re just going to be ourselves.\"\nHistory has been cruel to teams losing the first two games of a best-of-seven series, with those losing two on the road to start coming back to win only 10 of 47 times.\nYet, don’t talk about obstacles with Cubs president Theo Epstein. He was the Boston Red Sox GM when they trailed the New York Yankees 3-0 in the 2004 American League Championship Series, only to come back and make baseball history by winning four consecutive games.\nThen again, he was also that 12-year-old kid standing on his parents’ couch with his twin brother, Paul, watching Game 6 of the 1986 World Series between the Mets and his beloved Red Sox, ready to celebrate the Red Sox’s first title since 1918.\n\"We decided that we wanted to be connected to the earth when the last out went into the glove,\" Epstein said. \"So we stood on top of our parents’ couch with two outs in the (10th) inning. We were going to jump off when the last out went in the glove.\n\"We were on that couch for about 25 minutes.\"\nThey watched in horror as the Red Sox blew their two-run lead, and ultimately lose, when Mookie Wilson’s grounder trickled through first baseman Bill Buckner’s legs.\n\"We ended up crumbling to the ground pathetically,\" Epstein said. \"We just sat there for half an hour.\n\"That one hurt. That was a tough one to recover from.\"\nEpstein felt the same pain 17 years later when New York Yankees third baseman Aaron Boone homered in Game 7 of the ALCS, ruining the Red Sox’s season again.\nYet, along came that glorious 2004 season, and even down 3-0 in the ALCS, Epstein never lost hope, with his scouting director, Jason McLeod, boldly predicting before the game that if the Red Sox would won Game 4, they would go to the World Series.\n\"There are so many similarities that are impossible to ignore,\" Epstein said. \"From the passion to the heartbreak to the hope.\"\nFOR THE WIN\nCubs president Theo Epstein weighs in on the secret to winning the World Series\nSo, if you really want to hear the Cubs laugh now, tell them they’ve got no chance.\nThey heard the same thing in spring training when Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo predicted in January they would win the division. And again in mid-summer when they were struggling to stay in the wild-card race. And even last week playing against the mighty St. Louis Cardinals in the NL Division Series.\nYet, here they are, believing that even with the lopsided pitching matchups on paper in the next two games with Kyle Hendricks and Jason Hammel going against deGrom and Steven Matz, they can still get this series back to New York, giving them a bigger stage to celebrate.\n\"Rocky set a great example in 1976 for all of us,\" Cubs manager Joe Maddon said, who actually had the theme to that movie blaring inside the Cubs’ clubhouse Sunday night. \"When you get behind the eight ball a little bit, sometime you just go pound on some big slabs of beef in the cooler, and obviously you come back and you’re fine.\n\"I promise you, guys are ready to play. We've been through those moments in the past. You've got to throw that jab. You've got to stagger the other guy a little bit and get momentum going back in your favor.\n\"So anything's possible, man.\"\nCertainly, the Cubs have to make adjustments at the plate, or pray that the Mets’ pitching staff can’t stay this dominant with their power arms, and pin-point control of off-speed pitches.\nThe high-powered Cubs have been gasping for air, scoring just three runs in the first two games, batting just .159 with a .221 on-base percentage and .238 slugging percentage. They hit 10 home runs in their four-game NL Division series against the Cardinals, and have managed just three extra-base hits. And, oh, have they seen their share of fastballs, with the Mets throwing 103 pitches clocked at 95 mph or faster compared to the Cubs’ three pitches of 95.\n\"It’s been impressive,\" said Texas Rangers pitching Mike Maddux. \"Their front-line guys keep coming at you with a lot of fire power. People keep talking about their velocity, but they more than that. They’ve got different ways to get you out.\"\nYou know the Mets have got something special going when rookie Noah Syndergaard faces Schwarber with Dexter Fowler on second base, and on a full count, has the guts to throw a changeup that left Schwarber swinging at air.\n\"We’ve got to adjust, and do it in a hurry,\" Cubs infielder Javier Baez says. \"We know what we can do, but we’ve got to do it.\"\nCertainly, the Mets are aware that the Cubs can recover at any time. They watched the Cubs beat up on them all season, winning all seven games they played against one another. And no National League team has greater young raw power.\n\"The minute you think they’re naïve enough to think this is over,\" Mets manager Terry Collins said, \"you’re making a big mistake. They know exactly what they’re facing.\"\nThe Cubs have proven all year how dangerous they can be, and as Jon Lester reminds his teammates, don’t even think about what’s at stake.\n\"I’ve always been a big believer in playing stupid,\" he said. \"We have nothing to lose. We weren’t supposed to be here. We were supposed to be in the rebuilding stages.\n\"Here we are.\"\nSo, no reason for the Cubs to go home early now.\n\"This is nothing new to us,\" said Cubs third baseman Kris Bryant, the NL’s presumed Rookie of the Year. \"There’s no sense of desperation. No one’s panicking. There’s no pressure.\n\"Look at the Red Sox that year. Anything’s possible in the playoffs. We win, it will make this story that much better.\"\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter: @Bnightengale\nGALLERY: THE CUBBIE CORPS\nThe Cubbie Corps consists of the six core players on the Cubs who are under the age of 27.
