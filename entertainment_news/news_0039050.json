I will not stop doing that. Ever. Believe me when I tell you this: ever stop doing that. That being said, I’m not going to subject this team to any further distraction.”\nWhile commendable to take the high road, his response could also have been interpreted as defeatist, his fate indeed having been sealed by bullpen and discipline mismanagements.\nOn Monday, the news was confirmed: the Nationals had fired Williams after two years, with the 2016 season guaranteed on his contract.\nUSA TODAY\nNationals fire manager Matt Williams\nThe 49-year-old, five-time All-Star third baseman with Giants, Diamondbacks and Indians had been named Washington’s manager prior to the 2014 season in which his club won 96 games and the National League East. Williams even received NL Manager of the Year honors but lost his job after the consensus most talented team — which added free-agent ace Max Scherzer to already potent rotation and roster — won just 83 games and finished seven games behind the Mets.\nThere are two major demands of a manager: the managing of people through communication, encouragement and discipline and the managing of the game through strategy. Williams appeared to fail at both.\nIn a conference call Monday, Nationals general manager Rizzo said Williams had “steadiness to him, a calm to him” and that “he led by example.”\nThe Washington Post cited players describing Williams as “tense” and that “he doesn’t talk to people in” the clubhouse, which was deemed a “terrible environment.” When closer Jonathan Papelbon choked star Bryce Harper in the dugout, Williams admitted he didn’t ask enough questions about what happened and allowed Papelbon to keep pitching. He even clumsily said he was benching Harper, even though he was the victim and already scheduled to get that next game off.\nSimilarly obvious were his tactical blunders. The discussion around Williams’ bullpen usage began in NLDS Game 4 last October when he didn’t use his best relievers — Tyler Clippard or Stephen Strasburg, who was available in the bullpen that day — in a pivotal seventh inning against the Giants’ best hitters, instead turning to rookie Aaron Barrett and demoted closer Rafael Soriano.\n“Not one single incident was the tipping point of making the decision,\" Rizzo said Monday.\nUSA TODAY\nJonathan Papelbon attacks Bryce Harper in dugout fight\nFurthermore, Williams was too rigid in when to deploy his best relievers, closer-turned-setup man Drew Storen and acquired closer Papelbon, often declining to use them in anything other than their prescribed roles of protecting leads in the 8th and 9th innings. Most glaringly, on Sept. 1, Williams used Casey Janssen in the ninth inning of a tied game even though Janssen had pitched poorly and taken the loss the night before and Papelbon remained available. Williams’ next-day explanation in a radio interview with 106.7 The Fan didn’t help matters, when he insisted of Papelbon, “He’s our closer,” as if he couldn’t pitch at any other time. Williams added a hypothetical: “Let’s say, for instance, Pap throws a clean ninth and we score in the 10th. Who’s closing the game for us? I guess it’d be ‘Somebody,’ right?” Again, there’s that rigidity.\nSimilarly, when facing the division rival Mets on July 31 and Aug. 1, Williams didn’t use either Storen or Papelbon in a pair of one-run losses. The Mets won the first game in 12 innings and the second when rallying for runs in the seventh and eighth innings — all high leverage situations.\nAlso, when Strasburg was visibly uncomfortable on the mound in an early May start, grimacing in the first inning without a visit from the trainer, manager or pitching coach. He ultimately was removed after three innings with an ailment.\nAdmittedly, Washington suffered an undue number of injuries this season — Strasburg didn’t miss a start then but was out a month later in the season; position players Ryan Zimmerman, Anthony Rendon, Jayson Werth and Denard Span all missed appreciable chunks of the season, as did starter Doug Fister.\nThose disabled-list stints and a series of players under-performing when healthy couldn’t overcome Bryce Harper’s historic and likely MVP season. Williams alone probably couldn’t have turned this club into a contender, but it seems clear his continuing as manager would be detrimental to the Nationals moving forward.\nWilliams had served on Arizona manager Kirk Gibson’s staff for a few seasons before taking over in Washington, where he was thrust into the manager’s office of a club with high expectations — a difficult place for someone new to the role.\n“Everybody learns every single day,” Williams said when asked to reflect on his growth. “You’re faced with challenges, whether it’s day one or the end of the second year — it doesn’t change as long as you manage. That being said, we work hard. We take this very seriously, and we want to win as many games as we can. I look forward to that on an every day basis, and that’s part of the grind. That’s part of the pleasure of the job, is to have those bumps and get over them. Learn. Be better.”\nWilliams did have one division crown in Washington, but a loaded Nationals expected far more than a distant second-place standing with negativity engulfing the franchise. Williams may well learn and be better down the road — it just won’t happen in Washington.\nGALLERY: MANAGERIAL CAROUSEL\nOct. 5: The Nationals fire Matt Williams, who won the NL manager of the year award in 2014.
