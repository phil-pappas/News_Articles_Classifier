(AP) - Authorities say a man and woman left the woman's name and telephone number in the guestbook of a South Florida art gallery before stealing about $6,000 worth of jewelry.\nPalm Beach police say 24-year-old Megan Ohara and 19-year-old David Ziskowski took a bracelet and a ring Sunday from the Attila JK exhibition at the ICFA Gallery. They were spotted a short time later at a nearby grocery, and police reported finding the jewelry in the woman's purse.\nOfficers found multiple fake email addresses and at least one obscene drawing in the gallery's guestbook. The South Florida Sun Sentinel ( http://goo.gl/UEPiqq ) reports that two of the fake emails included the name \"Meg\" and one included Ohara's phone number.\nOhara and Ziskowski were arrested and charged with grand theft. Jail records didn't list attorneys.\n___\nInformation from: Sun Sentinel , http://www.sun-sentinel.com/\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
