The desert tortoise is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.\nIn the past nine years, 475 baby desert tortoises have been raised at the 6-acre site known as the Tortoise Research and Captive Rearing Site, or TRACRS.\nThe compound is located at Sand Hill, in the southwest corner of the base near Landers; the area has the largest population of desert tortoises on the base.\nBut until this point, the slow-growing tortoises weren’t big enough to be outside their fenced compound that is covered with nets to keep out birds of prey.\nThere they got supplemental water from sprinklers meant to mimic rainfall and a steady diet of shrubs and wildflowers that grow naturally in their spacious pens. That helped them grow faster than they would in the wild, Henen said.\nResearchers discovered in earlier efforts that releasing tortoises before they are at least 4 inches long almost ensures they will become lunch for ravens, coyotes or kit foxes.\nOnce they reach that size, their shells harden and they no longer risk becoming what one scientist called “walking ravioli” for predators.\nTwo Dash Four was the last of 35 young tortoises to venture out into the big, wide world. The others were released over the past couple of weeks.\nBeing larger, they also are better equipped to cope with the desert’s heat and lack of water.\n“There’s all sorts of advantages to being big,” Henen said.\nFINDING A BURROW\nLike its mother, Two Dash Four has a small radio transmitter attached to its shell. Scientists planned to follow its movements in the hours after release to make sure Two Dash Four found a burrow.\nOn Wednesday, before two dozen reporters, state wildlife officials and base personnel, Two Dash Four made its way directly into a burrow surrounded by creosote bush, one of the desert tortoise’s favorite foods.\nA few minutes later, the young animal was outside again, heading across the dusty, barren landscape at a surprisingly brisk clip.\nThat might indicate the tortoise was uncomfortable in the burrow, or it might mean it was curious about its surroundings, said Ken Nagy, a UCLA professor emeritus and lead investigator on the program.\n“The burrow is critically important to their success out here because it protects them from the two main causes of death: overheating and predation,” he said.\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:06:26.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
