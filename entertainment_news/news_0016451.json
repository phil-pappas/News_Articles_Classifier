Austin police are casting Shia LaBeouf as a drunken antagonist.\nThe “Transformers” star was detained Friday night after stumbling into a roadway against the light and stopping traffic with two female companions in tow, his arresting officer testified in an affidavit.\nThe officer, identified in the affidavit as Sgt. Jelesijevic, wrote that he observed a “strong odor of an alcoholic beverage” coming from the actor at the time he was detained at the city’s famous 6th St. nightlife strip.\n“While speaking with Sgt. Jelesijevic, LaBeouf stated that if stopped by Los Angeles Police Department he typically walks away because Police had killed a friend of his,” according to the affidavit.\n“And he became increasingly confrontational, aggravated, profane and verbally aggressive with Sgt. Jelesijevic throughout the stop, calling him a ‘silly man’ three times.”\nAfter he spotted a bystander filming the incident, LaBeouf further lost his cool, puffing out his chest and attempting to walk towards the unidentified male in a “threatening manner,” according to the arresting officer.\nHe then turned to Sgt. Jelesijevic and continued his verbal tirade against the officer while “staring intently,” cops said.\nThe 29-year-old actor claimed he was a National Guard member and told the officer he needed to “do whatever the f--k you gotta do!” the affidavit reads.\nLaBeouf was ultimately arrested and later charged with public intoxication.\nAnthony DelMundo//POOL The actor has had a tough legal run in recent years including a June 2014 arrest in New York City for disrupting a Broadway performance of Rob Kim/Getty Images FILE - OCTOBER 09: Actor Shia LaBeouf was arrested at the Austin City Limits music festival in Austin, Texas.
