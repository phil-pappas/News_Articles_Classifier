The Badger State also boasts the nation's highest level of binge drinking.\nThose incidents related to excessive alcohol cost an estimated $6.8 billion each year. That's $1,200 for every man, woman and child in the state, reports CBS New travel editor Peter Greenberg.\nOn game day at the University of Wisconsin, Badger fans get an early start. There's no alcohol allowed in the stadium, so the party outside is in full swing before 10 am. Tailgates will happen all weekend across the country.\n\"We have one of the biggest problems in the nation, and yet we have some of the fewest solutions to correct it,\" State Sen. Tim Carpenter said.\nCarpenter co-authored four of six bills this year to toughen drinking and driving laws. None have made it to the state senate for a vote.\n\"The dirty secret is the assembly passed legislation last time, it came in front of the transportation committee, but then Sen. Fitzgerald wouldn't schedule any of the bills,\" Carpenter said.\nScott Fitzgerald is majority leader of the state senate.\n\"If you had everyone appear before a judge, it would be very difficult for the system to deal with that right now,\" Fitzgerald said.\n\"What you are saying, if I can interpret this correctly, there are so many people drunk out there, the system can't handle them,\" Greenberg said.\n\"Yeah, if you went to a felony conviction. I'm not sure what difference that would make,\"Fitzgerald said. \"We are trying to take an approach that is more measured and will get these people clean.\"\nBeyond the politics, but often in the debate, are the families forced into advocacy.\nJudy and Paul Jenkins lost their daughter Jennifer, granddaughter Courtney and the unborn granddaughter Jennifer was carrying in a 2008 accident. The man who killed them, Mark Benson, was sentenced to 30 years in prison. It was his fourth offense for operating a vehicle while intoxicated and among the state's stiffest rulings.\nBut the Jenkins' say mandatory minimum sentences on first-time offenders may have prevented their tragedy.\nPaul Jenkins said when someone gets pulled over for a DUI, the offender gets a traffic ticket. He or she doesn't lose his or her license or car.\n\"You don't even have to show up in court to answer the ticket,\" he said.\nJulia Sherman is the coordinator for the Wisconsin Alcohol Policy Project. She says despite little action in the state legislature, progress is happening in town after town and through volunteer programs like police saturation patrols. \"This is a task force. They let the public know when they are going to be on the road,\" Sherman said.\n\"It's a show of force, and they can pull anyone over for any violation,\" she added.\nIn a state that prohibits sobriety checkpoints, saturation patrols have shown success. Since Brown County launched the federally funded program in 2011, year-over-year reductions have been realized in alcohol-related crashes, injuries and deaths.\n\"More and more communities are adopting things and it's going to come down to communities lead the way and people in Madison will end up following them,\" Sherman said.\nBut Carpenter, in the state legislature for 31 years, says any significant change to Wisconsin's drinking and driving laws will take some time.\n\"I would say, to be honest with you, I don't see legislation passing in this session or next session, probably after the next gubernatorial election in 2018, maybe it will happen,\" Carpenter said.\nA new bill was introduced just this week, but it's considered a compromise bill because even if it passes, it would only revoke a person's driver's license after five DUIs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:37:09.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
