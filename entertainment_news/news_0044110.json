However, the film-maker was forced to deny rumours of a rival male-fronted Ghostbusters film led by Channing Tatum in July, stating: “ There is only one new Ghostbusters movie and that is the Paul Feig-directed version coming next July, presently filming and going fantastically. The rest is just noise.”\nAn animated version would be an innovative way of delivering fresh Ghostbusters material on the big screen. It might also be possible for the film to focus on the original spirit-spiting quartet introduced more than three decades ago, with Aykroyd, Bill Murray and Ernie Hudson returning to voice parapsychologists Ray Stantz, Peter Venkman and Winston Zeddemore. The fourth original ghostbuster, Harold Ramis (Egon Spengler) died in February last year.\nNo director or writer is currently attached to the animated concept. Murray, Aykroyd, Hudson, Sigourney Weaver (Dan Barrett) and Annie Potts (secretary Janine Melnitz) are all returning for Feig’s film, some in cameos and others in newly created roles.\nThis article was written by Ben Child, for theguardian.com on Friday 2nd October 2015 17.59 Europe/London guardian.co.uk © Guardian News and Media Limited 2010", "external_links": ["http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/31/female-ghostbusters-producer-ivan-reitman-denies-all-male-remake-rumours-paul-feig", "http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/03/01/poweredbyguardian.png", "http://gu.com/p/4dx59", "http://variety.com/2015/film/news/ghostbusters-animated-movie-sony-1201607981/", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/ghostbusters-animated-movie-works-828766"], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T14:29:41.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
