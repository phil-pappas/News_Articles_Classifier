In the meantime, we've got the brand new poster to pour over.\nTake a look.\nCheck out the new official poster! Tune in to @ESPN ’s Monday Night Football for a new look at #TheForceAwakens . pic.twitter.com/NTRWLlVyID\n— Star Wars (@starwars) October 18, 2015 The poster comes as pre-sales go online tomorrow at most major cinemas across the globe. Here in Ireland, cinemas such as Lighthouse Cinema in Smithfield, Dublin have already announced they're taking bookings and planning events for December 17th.\nNow, let's start hyper-analysing every aspect of it. Turn away now if you don't want to see any potential spoilers.\nWe begin with that big giant Death Star-like thing behind Daisy Ridley. Is that a third Death Star or is it so-called Starkiller Base that we've heard so much about?\nThere's no Luke Skywalker OR General Hux anywhere that we can immediately see. Are they secondary characters? Do they not feature as much as we thought they would or is just a case of there wasn't enough space on the poster for them?\nWe're also noting that Rey and Kylo Ren are literally side-by-side, almost as if they were... TWINS... Is this a possible confirmation of that \"Kylo and Rey are actually the son and daughter of Han Solo and Princess Leia\" we've been hearing for so long?\nThey've also abandoned any kind of subtlety about Finn / John Boyega not being a Jedi because... well... there's his lightsaber and all. Also, check out Leia's new hairdo. WURK IT GURL.\nWe'll have more insanely detailed analysis for you tomorrow when the new trailer drops.\nMORE: Mark Hamill says that near-death experience on Skellig Michael never happened\nMORE: Doctor Who actress Gugu Mbatha-Raw cast in Star Wars: Episode VIII\nMORE: Luke Skywalker throws his support behind Kerry, so Dublin has...
