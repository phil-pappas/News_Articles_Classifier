I'm feeling better now. I really hope everyone can make the rescheduled date on Friday. \n''Thank you so much for all the trends and lovely messages you guys did for me it really shows how amazing u guys actually are. \n''As I said I'm feeling much better now and I really can't wait to perform and make it up to everyone later (sic)'' \nThe cancelled concert has now been rescheduled for Friday (23.10.15) but band member Harry Styles recently admitted he was ''disappointed'' the group had to cancel for the first time in their five-year career. \nHe said: ''[Liam's] ok; he was just very, very ill. To be honest, we feel kind of lucky that we've got to this point and never cancelled one (a show). So obviously, we're all very disappointed and very, very much apologise to everyone who was there. \n''But it happened so late because we were trying to get on and it was just impossible. He wasn't well enough. We very very much apologise to everyone. We're disappointed ourselves as well.''
