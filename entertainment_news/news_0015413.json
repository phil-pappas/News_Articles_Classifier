Farwell Ave. (also 1 p.m. Oct. 8, Oriental) \nVeteran character actor John Ashton plays a Wisconsin farmer with a dark secret who's really determined to keep it that way in this thriller, filmed by Steven Piet (in his feature-film debut) mostly in Prairie du Sac and Lodi. Ashton, Piet and cinematographer Mike Bove are scheduled to attend. \n\"A Hard Day,\" 9:45 p.m., Times Cinema, 5906 W. Vliet St. (also 9:30 p.m. Oct. 4, Landmark Downer Theatre, 2589 N. Downer Ave.) \nIt seems every year I manage to catch at least one of the film festival's fast-paced crime-movie imports; this year's leading contender is this Korean black-comedy thriller about a police detective trying to make the best of the worst day of his career, as he wrestles with everything from his mother's funeral to deadly corruption in his own department. In Korean with English subtitles. \n— Chris Foran \nLook for continuing coverage and more picks for this year's Milwaukee Film Festival at jsonline.com/movies.
