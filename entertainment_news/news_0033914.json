By accepting this Project assignment, you may be required to do any of the following: appear fully nude; wear a pubic hair patch; perform genital-to-genital touching; have your genitals painted; simulate oral sex with hand-to-genital touching; contort to form a table-like shape while being fully nude; pose on all fours while others who are fully nude ride on your back; ride on someone's back while you are both fully nude; and other assorted acts the Project may require. The Project will also include language and sexual situations that some may consider personally objectionable or uncomfortable.\" Mobile users, please view here. \nHBO did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nThe one-hour drama, inspired by the 1973 film of the same name, is \"a dark odyssey about the dawn of artificial consciousness and the future of sin.\" The series, set to air in February, stars Anthony Hopkins, Ed Harris, Evan Rachel Wood, James Marsden and Thandie Newton. \nJonathan Nolan serves as executive producer/writer/director and Lisa Joy is executive producer/writer.
