Have more sex ladies, it boosts your immunity! By Sakshita Khosla on October 8, 2015 at 7:18 PM Comments Mumbai, October 8 : That sex is good for the health is a fact well known. Another fact very well known is that having sex, even during the infertility points in the menstrual cycle, increases the chances of a woman conceiving. But for the longest time, scientists had not been able to tell why exactly is this so. But now the mystery has been solved. According to a recent research study, frequency of sex has a direct connection with the immunity of a woman’s body. The more the sex, the more positively will the immune system be triggered, which in turn will kickstart the physiological changes in a woman’s body, boosting her chances of conceiving.

The research findings in Fertility and Sterility show that sexually active women had higher Type 2 T-cell counts during the phase when the uterine wall is thickening to receive the embryo, after the end of ovulation and before the start of the period. This period is called the Luteal Phase. Presence of Type 2 T-cells creates a more hospitable environment for conception- without functioning Type 2 T-cells, the body’s the immune system would otherwise attack sperm cells and an emerging embryo. The study also showed that there is a further boost in the Type 1 T-cell count in sexually active women, during the period before ovulation- follicular phase- which prevents the woman from contracting any diseases or infections, further improving her chances of conceiving. The second paper compared the immunoglobulin antibody levels of sexually active women with sexually inactive women. The findings again showed higher presence of certain antibodies during various phases of the cycle, and a general reflection of greater efforts of preparing the body for the implantation, in sexually active women. The findings can go a long way for physicians trying to help couples with fertility issues, to conceive. \n 18 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:18:12.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
