So what do I get? Excommunicated from Sox Nation. Told to moutza myself by both Cubs and Sox fans. And accused of bandwagon jumping. As if.\nYou're excommunicated, John . Michael Bartello .\nHell freezes over! Kass wishes Cubs well John Kass With the Cubs in the playoffs against Pittsburgh on Wednesday and crazed Cubs fans so amped up, what are White Sox fans to do?\nSome people insist they are Chicago fans, loving the Cubs and the Sox equally.

And to such people I say, please moutza yourself before someone beats me to it.\nYou're either...\n(John Kass) What's next? You'll deny me fire, water and shelter from Madison Street to Kankakee?\nMichael, Michael, Michael. The South Side is all about love.\nJohn Kass were you waterboarded and left wet in a cold room until you wrote this article? Pat \"Cubs Fan\" Fitzmaurice.\nYes, but they gave me a warm towel. And some chocolate.\nI was watching Wednesday night's game with my twin 10-year-olds and even though I enjoy explaining the intricacies of playoff baseball, why must I be tortured with the abundance of Viagra/Cialis commercials? Jim \"Mr. Cub\" Nicholas.\nJust wait. Before you know it, your boys will pick up on the announcer fast-talking through the part about calling a doctor if there is a particular swelling lasting for four hours or more. Then try to deal with that one between innings. Been there with my sons. Commercials are a problem.\nI'm 76 and a Cub fan since I could hold a baseball, even though I haven't lived in Chicago since 1961. Being a Cub fan is a genetic disease. My grandfather was a Cub fan as was my father. Thanks for pointing out that we Cub fans are people too.\nAnd you're correct. I don't give a rat's ass for the Sox. Larry Savage.\nCubs, Cardinals fans found in surprising places, according to Facebook data Rachel Crosby Illinois is a swing state.\nIn the north, it's bright blue. A belt in the middle is mixed. And across the south, it's overwhelmingly red. But this isn't politics mapped. It's baseball.\nThough Chicago is home to two teams, the Cubs and the Cardinals dominate the state. A look at Facebook user data...\nIllinois is a swing state.\nIn the north, it's bright blue. A belt in the middle is mixed. And across the south, it's overwhelmingly red. But this isn't politics mapped. It's baseball.\nThough Chicago is home to two teams, the Cubs and the Cardinals dominate the state. A look at Facebook user data...\n(Rachel Crosby) Cubs fans have a genetic disease? Hmm. Filling a ballpark for more than 100 years to watch lovable losers is perhaps less a sign of genetic abnormality than just a sign of a lot of people being cuckoo. On the South Side, things are all too real all the time. Thanks for the honesty about the rat.\nIt is only fair Mr. Kass to take those five fingers of yours and give yourself a prolonged Moutza. Unfortunately, the curse of the goat is still upon the Cubs, it will cease to exist only when the Cubs win the National League championship. Thanassis Varros .\nI say good luck to Cubs fans and you moutza me by my own hand? In my own column? Such aggression cannot stand, man.\nAs long as the Cubs fans I know understand that I am not a fan of the Cubs or a \"Chicago fan\" and that I wish them well, then I support the view you have taken. We are dogs and they are not of our world. So I'll sit near my soon to be fiancee and watch the game without saying Bartman, making goat noises or risk getting stabbed by a kitchen utensil. You don't deserve a moutza, the idiots from both fan bases do. Great story once again . Ross Meister, Sox fan .\nThanks Ross, it sounds like a plan. Only one thing would make it nicer. Make some goat soup for your fiance. You know why.\nTakes a big man. Now how do we get a Cubs hat on you? Bas Rigas .\nI was at Wrigley when a Cubs fan tried sneaking a Cubs hat over my head without my knowledge. And one inning later, a fly ball was hit to left field. And a guy named Steve reached out his hand and stepped into legend. So watch it.\nJohn, are you going soft? Lisa Monty Krick .\nLike a bleepin' grape.\nIf you say something nice about Boss Madigan, I know the world will be ending soon! Michael Jakubiec .\nDon't worry. The world won't end soon.\nI wouldn't write it — even after torture . Dan O'Keefe .\nMaking my two younger Cubs fan brothers happy isn't torture. But they won't let me watch the games with them. I don't think they quite trust me.\nWow. Sounds like you're taking the high road of The Great Costanza: If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right. Either that or there's some Greek folklore about kissing the enemy for good (bad?) luck. Go Cubs! Chip Marshall.\nNothing like a Cubs \"Seinfeld\" reference when the pressure's on. But you have a point. From now on, whenever a politician is indicted, I will kiss their hands in respect. When the mayor says something snarky to me, I'll say, 'Good one, little guy! Let's have a hug!' When some evil Cardinal throws at a Cubs head, will I say, \"I'm sure it was an accident.\" Or, in the words of Joe Maddon, \"Maybe Tony Soprano was in their dugout.\"\nBah. I say bah because of the abuse we take at the hands of Cubbie fans and the media, whether they are (in the case of fans) sneering and bashing everything about the team or (in the case of many media members) ignoring, abusing or flat-out rooting against the Sox. Sorry. And funny you should post your Bartman pic. After what the media put that guy through (I won't say specific names) I have no desire at all to wish the Beloveds well.\" Daniel Grillo .\nThere's no 'bah' in baseball, is there?\njskass@tribpub.com\nTwitter @John_Kass\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Major League Baseball Chicago Cubs Chicago White Sox Commentary National League St. Louis Cardinals Opinion", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56170c72/turbine/ct-cubs-cardinals-nation-met-20151008", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56140662/turbine/ct-kass-cubs-met-1007-20151006", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56170bcd/turbine/ct-cubs-letters-kass-met-1009-20151009"], "published": "2015-10-09T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:33:44.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
