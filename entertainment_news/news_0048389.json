They sat on a recreation field at the Marysville facility as Etheridge sang a few songs and offered encouragement from a small stage. \nShe says she'd been moved by a video of inmates in an addiction-recovery group singing \"A Little Bit of Me.\" She closed with the song and invited members of the group to come up and sing with her. \nShe later visited their dormitory, where she left her autographed handprints in paint on the wall and encouraged them to contact her when they're released. \nThink your friends should see this?
