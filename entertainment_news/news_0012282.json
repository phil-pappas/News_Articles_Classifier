The lines in practice:\nEvan Rodrigues-Cal O'Reilly-Jason Akeson\nAllan McPherson-Phil Varone-Nick Baptiste\nJerry D'Amigo-Matt Ellis-Jason Bailey\nWilliam Carrier/Justin Kea/Jean Dupuy/Jack Nevins\nI'm assuming Catenacci slides into the left wing spot on Varone's line, since that's where he was in the preseason game on Thursday. I'm guessing Schaller moves between D'Amigo and Bailey.\n* * * * * * *\nAmerks players and coaches are out delivering season tickets this afternoon.\nCunneyworth rode his motorcycle to the rink for practice this morning and also took it out for his deliveries.\nHe rides a Yamaha Super Tenere 1200, a bike he says is great for off-rode riding as well as the streets.\nHis love for motorcycles began when he was a player with the Amerks in the early 1980s, and he teamed up with teammates Lou Crawford and Dirk Rueter, as well as Steve Bartlett for a few rides. Bartlett at the time owned Cycle Enterprises. He has been an agent for hockey players for the past 30 years and is president of his firm, Pittsford-based Sports Consulting Group.\nWhat's different about riding now than then?\n\"I am much slower,\" Cunneyworth said. \"I enjoy the scenery more than anything and you have to go slow to see the scenery.\"\n* * * * * * *\nConcessions at Blue Cross Arena at the Rochester Community War Memorial have a few new items.\nNow on the menu:\nMeatballs in a cup (three varieties; Swedish, barbecue and marinara). At Riverside Rohrbach's, behind section 106. Poutine fries (topped with cheese curds, gravy and bacon bits). At International Stand, behind section 102. Rochester fries (topped with meat hot sauce and onions). At International Stand. Grilled chicken sandwich. At Court Street Grille, behind section 128. Taco salad. At Mexican Stand, behind section 126). Chili cheese fries. At International Stand. Perry's Ice Cream. At Sweet Spot, behind section 102. * * * * * * *\nThe opening night \"mystery\" puck will feature the 60th anniversary logo.\nEach is signed by a player and they'll be on sale game night.\nThe \"mystery\" puck that will be on sale at Friday's Amerks season opener.
