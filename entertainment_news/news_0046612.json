The most logical way to repeat the success is to make some more follow-up movies. In an interview with TopGear.com, director George Miller revealed the obstacles to make the movie while also hinting that there would be two more sequels, but not in the near future. Miller opened up that bringing \"Fury Road\" to the big screen needed a lot of energies and it was a long onerous process. \"This film was green lit three times and fell over three times over a decade,\" Miller said. \"We went to shoot with Mel Gibson back in 2001, but then 9/11 happened, and the American dollar collapsed against the Australian dollar close to 30 percent, so we lost that amount of budget overnight.\" He chronicled a lot of unexpected events that halted the filming process. \"We were then rained out of Australia,\" he opened up. \"The desert rained for the first time in 15 years, and we ended up in South West Africa, Namibia. But in this process, we had dug down deep into the backstory, not only of the characters, but of every vehicle. How the steering wheels became religious artefacts and things like that.\" With those unpredicted events happening, the team behind the movie had to adjust the story and they ended up having two scripts rather than revising the existing one. \"So we ended up with two scripts, without really trying,\" he added. \"We're talking to the studio [Warner Bros.] about it as we speak, but which one of the two stories will happen next, I'm not so sure.\" The director then slipped an interesting statement. He hinted that there would be two more \"Mad Max\" movies coming, but he wanted to do a small movie first before he did \" Mad Max: The Wasteland \". It is presumably because the director is too tired to shoot the movies back-to-back. \"I want to do a small film without special effects before I do any of that, just to do it quickly,\" Miller said. \"We shot 'Fury Road' for eight months... that's a lot. Every day in the heat and the dust, doing these stunts, it's very wearing. We've got two more planned, but at some point in the future.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Mad Max: Fury Road News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T10:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:34:32.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
