The 10851 awards program pins, named as such because of the California Vehicle Code \"Section 10851\" which states individuals may not take or drive vehicles they do not in fact own or have permission to take or drive, were given to Deputy Alexander Brust and Deputy Tyler Eikermann.\nStating that both officers \"worked hard for this,\" the CHP representative acknowledged Deputy Eikermann's finding \"three rollers\" and nine abandoned vehicles, all worth \"about $131,000.00\" and Deputy Brust's finding \"six rollers\" and \"19 abandoned vehicles\" recovered, al estimated to be worth \"$164,000.00.\" Both officers did so in a 12-month period. Brust got a pin and a certificate.\nKofC Tootsies\nThe Mayor proclaimed the dates October 17, 18, and 19 to be \"Knights of Columbus Tootsie Roll Drive Days” in the City of Vista, in recognition of the organization's involvement with fund raising activities to help intellectually disabled children and adults.\nBlood Donors\nIn a presentation to city officials by David Wellis, Chief Executive Officer for the San Diego Blood Bank, it seems \"the walls are up\" already for their new facility being built here and there is an expectation that it will be completed in December this year.\n\"Thank you for the opportunity. I just wanted to provide the council with an update on how we're doing, and why we're so excited to be building this facility in Vista.\"\nWellis stated that the mission remains the same. \"We were founded in 1950 ... to save lives in partnership with our community with quality blood services. We've been serving the San Diego, Imperial, Orange county and L.A. counties for a very long time. And we have an incredibly dedicated donor base in Vista, which is why we're so excited to put this new facility in this city.\"\nIn times of emergency the Blood Bank also is able to serve the country. Wellis informed the council that, with the help of the United States Navy, the SDBB managed to send hundreds of pints of blood to New York on the afternoon of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in 2001. They were also able to get donated blood up to Oregon after the recent shooting attack there.\nA new direction is also planned. \"While our core mission is to collect, [test and process] blood and to have it ready for those patients in need, we're also extending our capabilities to haveeven more impact in our communities health.\" Health, wellness, clinical trials, research and such.\nWellis also mentioned that the Blood Bank has just received funding from UCSD, and they will have a \"telemedicinel suite\" in the new facility. So people can come in, if they are part of a clinical trial, and be \"seen\" by physicians down in UCSD La Jolla up here in Vista.\nA ribbon-cutting ceremony is planned for December with the Chamber of Commerce.\nDr. Vodicka, VUSD Superintendent\nMore effective \"collective impact\" was on the mind of Dr. Devin Vodicka, Vista Unified School District Superintendent, in his fourth year now. Thirty different agencies were looking to make a difference in Vista but were unaware of the others.\n\"It seemed to me there had to be a better way to organize...\" Vodicka stated. He provided an overview of the collaborative program titled Vista Partnership for Children. (Click on the link for more information.)\nYield\nThe council then got down to calendar business. Two items were pulled for discussion: c-5 and c-7.\nThe first of those two items was regarding a proposal for a \"two-way stop at the intersection of Warmlands Avenue and Calle Sinaloa to control traffic on Calle Sinaloa.\"\nSam Hasenin, the City's traffic engineer, presented the issue. \"It was a concern that was brought up a few years ago and then a few months ago.\"\nDeputy Mayor John Aguilera said he read the complaint letter, and he figured that the traffic volume seemed low, but he ventured to guess that \"90 percent\" of the traffic was just due to the neighborhood there. \"It just seems like ... there's a car speeding through there.\"\nHasenin replied that this was not brought up as a factor. \"In this case the volumes were not considered.\" There's a point where volumes becaome an issue, however, he said. Everyone in the neighborhood was contacted on the matter.\nCouncilmember Amanda Rigby observed from the letter in her packet mentioned that \"the speeding is coming from down off of Warmlands\" and she questioned how stop signs on Calle Sinaloa on \"side streets\" would resolve the problem. She noted drivers maybe could not see and they do have a problem where they must \"inch out\" until it is safe to proceed across Warmlands. \"So ... if the traffic problem is coming down Warmlands, that should probably be where the stop sign is.\" She didn't believe it would be \"helpful\" to have stop signs on Calle Sinaloa.\nAguilera said he agreed with Rigby, and later on Mayor Ritter spoke and said she saw the same thing.\nCouncilmember John Franklin proposed a \"Yield\" sign instead. Hasenin answered the situation, even with low volume traffic, warranted some kind of control. Councilmember Cody Campbell then stated in his remarks that a yield sign is great for responsibility and insurance purposes, but he believed that what they needed to accomplish was more about preventing safety issues from occuring. \"I don't think this particular section ... would warrant a four-way stop.\"\n\"It could be considered,\" Hasenin said. The Mayor called on Aguilera then for remarks. He did not think a four-way stop would be effective.\nRigby asked about tickets to speeders or accidents on this road. Alternatives needed to be recommended, said City Manager Patrick Johnson. The yield sign seemed the best option and the council needed to choose where to put those. Council approved yield signs unanimously.\nTat kerfuffle\nDuring discussion items, a bit of a kerfuffle came about in the naming by Mayor Ritter of councilmembers to sit on a committee for the assignment of one more Tattoo business being allowed into downtown. The selection process was discussed. Applicants would be reviewed by the committee for the granting of a Special Use Permit for the tattoo establishment. All applicable standards must be met and a fee of $7,135 for processing required.\nWhen the issue of the committee came up, however,\nBret Schanzenbach, CEO for the Vista Chamber of Commerce spoke. He worried about \"quality control\" in the selection process and suggested \"option three\" out of the three choices.\nDeputy Mayor Aguilera said he agreed and wanted hours of business and criminal background checks done as well. Chris Ivan a tatoo business owner asked council for the consideration as one of two businesses in the city for five years as also in consideration for the location change.\n\"We had to go through [a lot of] regulations,\" he said and he wanted \"some consideration\" as a Vista business owner. Mayor Ritter answered that the selection committee could handle that.\nCampbell agreed with Aguilera's concerns. He wanted to add a Chamber of Commerce representative to the committee and also volunteered to be council rep on it and motioned that concern.\nRigby also wanted to be the committee. Mayor Ritter asked Councilman Franklin if he wanted to be on the committee as well. The City Manager needed to know which two council members would be on the committee. Mayor Ritter chose Aguilera for volunteering first. And then ignored Campbell and Rigby's willingness to serve. She asked Franklin if he would serve if she chose Agilera and Franklin.\n\"Actually, my motion does not include the Mayor making the appointment,\" Councilmember Campbell then stated.\nMayor Ritter asked Campbell \"who does then?\"\n\"The council does,\" answered Campbell. \"We can vote on it.\"\nMayor Ritter moved that she appoint the members for this committee and Rigby seconded. Campbell stated they needed to vote on the other motion first, regarding the addition of the Chamber of Commerce representative for this committee.\nSo both motions were approved unanimously.", "external_links": ["http://uwsd.org/Vista-Partnership-for-Children"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:24:36.985+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
