The daring spectacle, currently part of The SUPERNATURALISTS’ production, has gained Horsman notoriety in his failure to complete the escape during multiple public attempts. \n\"Spencer must put it all on the line if he wants to conquer this life threatening challenge once and for all!\" said Angel, who revealed that Horsman will retire the act from the show if next Monday’s performance is similarly unsuccessful. \nThe performance precedes The SUPERNATURALISTS’ return to Foxwoods this fall, as the show – starring Angel himself in an exclusive world premiere – will reappear at The Fox Theater for two limited runs in November and December. \n“Criss Angel’s genius in creating many of the most difficult stunts ever witnessed in the history of magic will make this event truly unforgettable,” said Felix Rappaport, President & CEO of Foxwoods Resort Casino. “Although Spencer Horsman, a member of The SUPERNATURALISTS is a world-class performer, his willingness to even attempt this feat is unimaginable.” \nThe SUPERNATURALISTS: A Limited Engagement featuring Criss Angel will take the stage at Foxwoods from November 11th through 15th, and December 16th through 20th. Tickets for all shows start at $65 and may be purchased online at www.foxwoods.com , or by calling the Foxwoods Box Office at 800-200-2882 or Ticketmaster at 800-745-3000.
