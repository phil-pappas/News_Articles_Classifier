From 1964 through 1966, Bob Bonis was the American tour manager for both The Beatles and Rolling Stones, accompanying both bands on their historic first U.S. tours – coming to and conquering America, and heralding The British Invasion.\nDuring his career, Bonis shot more than 5,000 photographs of the most legendary acts in music history including: 2,700 Rolling Stones photos, 800 Beatles photos, plus an eclectic mix of images encompassing Frank Sinatra, The Lovin’ Spoonful, Simon & Garfunkel, Chicago, Cream, The Hollies, Peter and Gordon and many of the jazz greats with whom he worked over the years.\nMost of these recently discovered photographs have never before been published, made available for purchase, or ever even seen by fans and collectors. Bob Bonis’ contribution to rock history is a magnificent collection of more than 3,500 historic photographs of two of the greatest bands in the world – The Beatles and the Rolling Stones. The unguarded and personal nature of these images reflect Bonis’ close friendship with the bands and offers a private, behind-the-scenes look into the early days of the historic British Invasion era of rock ‘n’ roll.\nThe Bob Bonis Archive has partnered with Rare Photo Archives to present, for the first time, the images of Bob Bonis as limited edition fine art prints, each hand numbered, embossed with the Bob Bonis Estate seal, and accompanied with a Certificate of Authenticity from The GRAMMY Museum® at L.A. Live, and to make these images available for sale to fans and collectors around the world.
