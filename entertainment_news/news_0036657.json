Canada, our biggest trading partner and close ally, has been led for nearly a decade by a Conservative prime minister, very able guy, running things up north since way back in 2006. You've seen him shake hands with the president and, um, his name is ….\nOh yeah, his name is Stephen Harper and he's just been swept out of the prime minister's office by a rock star: Justin Trudeau, a charismatic former snowboard instructor and nightclub bouncer, amateur boxer, relative newcomer to politics whose father was Pierre Trudeau, Canada's first rock star prime minister.\nIn parliamentary elections Monday, Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party unexpectedly pulled away from the competition. There was no big anti-incumbency push or political revolution to explain the victory. Canadians appeared happy enough with the status quo that the race for a while looked like a toss-up. Rather, Trudeau said he offered a \"positive, optimistic, hopeful vision\" that was \"not a naive dream.\"\nPlease note: We didn't call him dreamy. The Conservatives sort of did at one point, in an attack ad that said Trudeau, 43, wasn't ready for leadership; one would-be voter chimed in with, \"Nice hair, though.\"\nIt's hard to avoid focusing on the next Canadian prime minister's looks and personality. Not because that's a crucial benchmark for success but because of some uncanny similarities to his father, a brilliant, magnetic politician who took office in 1968 as both prime minister and cultural icon. They called the phenomenon \"Trudeaumania.\" Teen girls chased after Pierre Trudeau, and older women, the Tribune reported, were smitten. \"He's not the prime minister, he's Frank Sinatra,\" said one of the smitten.\nPierre Trudeau, who took office as a 48-year-old bachelor, was more dashing than conventionally handsome. He crushed hearts at age 52 by marrying 22-year-old Margaret Sinclair. When Trudeau lost a re-election bid in 1979, Margaret was partying with the Rolling Stones. The marriage, and Trudeau's second run as prime minister, ended in 1984. But the couple had three children, the eldest of whom is Justin.\nPolitically, Pierre Trudeau was a liberal powerhouse whose achievements included passing a bill of rights, establishing bilingualism and fending off separatism in Quebec. Justin Trudeau said his father's legacy was enough to make him leery of politics — for a while, anyway. He won a seat in parliament in 2008 and took over leadership of the Liberals in 2013.\nJustin Trudeau, expected to take office in several weeks, starts off with a few policy differences from the United States but also promising to repair relations with the U.S. that he said were hurt by the argument over the Keystone XL pipeline. Trudeau, like Harper, supports construction of the pipeline, in opposition to President Barack Obama. Trudeau also wants to end combat missions as part of the U.S.-led coalition attacking Islamic State.\nPolitics is always more about the future than the past, but here's one more historical footnote: In 1972, when Justin was 4 months old, President Richard Nixon attended a state dinner at the prime minister's residence and made a toast: \"Tonight we'll dispense with the formalities. I'd like to toast the future prime minister of Canada: to Justin Pierre Trudeau,\" Nixon said.\nPierre Trudeau responded, saying that if his son ever becomes leader, \"I hope he has the grace and skill of the president.\"\nLegacies.
