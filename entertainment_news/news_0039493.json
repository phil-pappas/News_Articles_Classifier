Following last year's Maleficent , the next Disney villain to get her own movie is Cruella de Vil, the fur-loving monster from ​101 Dalmatians ​. That's not really a surprise, since a Cruella movie has been in the works since at least 2013, but the big news is who's co-writing it: Kelly Marcel, who wrote the screenplay for ​Fifty Shades of Grey ​. It all makes sense, because if you think about it, Cruella has all the same personality traits as Elena, Christian's ex-lover and coach in the ways of bondage: manipulative and evil with a taste for expensive things.\n According to ​ The Hollywood Reporter ​, the Cruella movie has been fast-tracked, though no release date has been announced. Last week, Disney announced release dates for four untitled live-action movies in addition to the ones they're already working on, so this trend won't be going away anytime soon. Just hope that it culminates with a live-action edition of ​The Lion King ​, because who wouldn't pay good money to see real warthogs singing about their life mottos?\n​Follow Eliza on Twitter .", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/thompsonplaid", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cruella-fifty-shades-writer-kelly-830467"], "published": "2015-10-12T18:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:58:31.345+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
