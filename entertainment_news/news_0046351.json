Editors coo over every collection he produces — Vogue called his Spring 2014 show a “joyous assault on fashion orthodoxy”.\nAnna Wintour may be a fan, but I’m calling it: Rick Owens is trolling us all.\nIn January he sent male models down the runway in January with their junk hanging out. A few months later, he released his Spring/Summer 2016 footwear collaboration with Adidas.\nHere are some of his designs. They are devastatingly ugly.\nPhoto: Rick Owens/Adidas.

The New York Times called them “human knapsacks” , which were supposed to be a representation of the strength and power of womanhood.\n“I see [my vision for the collection] being more about nourishment, sisterhood/motherhood … Women raising women, women becoming women, and women supporting women,” Owens said in a statement.\n“Straps can be about restraint, but here they are all about support and cradling. Straps here become loving ribbons.”\nCool story, Ric.\nThis looks so uncomfortable. Picture: Francois Guillot/AFP. Source: AFP\nW ! Picture: Francois Guillot/AFP. Source: AFP\nIt’s frustrating to watch a fashion designer send confusing, impractical and overpriced looks down the runway and then hear them invent a tenuous existential theme to justify their collection.\nAnd what’s worse, is when the fashion press lap up the bulls***.\n“It felt like there was something profound and emotive to Owens’ vision,” wrote Ted Stansfield for Dazed .\n“It was a comment on incredible female strength and sisterhood — the weights women have to carry, their ability to support and nurture each other.\n“This was quintessentially Rick Owens, artful, provocative and profoundly innovative.”\nWell, this looks awkward. Picture: Francois Guillot/AFP. Source: AFP\nYou’ve got to be kidding me.\nHis clothes look like glorified Bonds or Lululemon basics. With a Kathmandu backpack strapped on top.\nYes, fashion is art. Yes, it’s not always designed to be worn on the high street. And yes, luxury fashion is expensive.\nBut let’s stop pretending that designers like Rick Owens offer up anything of substance — or clothes we’d actually wear.\n“Look normal. Be normal. Pretend like you aren’t carrying a whole human on your back”. Picture: Francois Guillot/AFP.
