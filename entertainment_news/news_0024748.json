From the circumstances of my birth, to the chance meeting of my wife, to taking on the largest state agency in Texas, and even miraculously surviving a vehicle rollover with my family; an event that inspired me to tell this story.” A story which led to the changing of state law affecting Engineers which passed unanimously in the Texas Legislation.\nPublished by New York City-based Page Publishing, David V Day, P.E’s gripping tale follows David as he takes on real life villains, exposing incompetence and corruption at the highest levels of the state government and courts. He does this with the help of two experienced attorneys and numerous engineers who have faced similar persecution from TDI. A must read for anyone who has ever struggled against corruption or had a bad experience with their insurance company, permit office or any unaccountable bureaucrat.\nReaders who wish to experience this revealing work can purchase “Defying the Odds” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708.\nAbout Page Publishing\nPage Publishing is a traditional New York based full-service publishing house that handles all of the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
