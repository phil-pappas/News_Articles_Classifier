Nothing seems out of bounds to her, but she doesn’t go out of her way to find something offensive, either.\nIn the special, directed by Chris Rock and taped last May, Schumer mocks being labeled a “sex comic” because she’s “a girl,” and then wryly reminds the audience “we have all been disgusting.”\nThat’s what makes her relatable to everyone. While Schumer slyly plays off of her own girly persona, she also is willing to take just enough time to make a joke real — use the “cold hard facts,” as a sports channel says.\n“I think sex is explained incorrectly as far as men’s and women’s roles,” Schumer notes.\nShe brings that home later when she talks about woman enjoying sex. When she asks the audience if they knew any sex acts that would please a woman, I think she proves it when a young man answers.\nWhile Schumer’s act was hilarious (we’ll let her tell the jokes), that moment (not repeatable in a family newspaper) was un-be-liev-able.\nWhere to watch\nWhat: Emmy-winning comedian does a stand-up special, directed by Chris Rock and taped at New York’s iconic theater.\nWhen: 10 p.m. Saturday.\nWhere: HBO.\nAbout the Author Reach the author at rob.lowman@dailynews.com or follow Rob on Twitter: @roblowman1 .\nFull bio and more articles by Rob Lowman Back to top", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/roblowman1", "http://mn1-laweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/persbilde?Avis=LA&ID=10"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:42:07.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
