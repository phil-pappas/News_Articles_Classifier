Although Christmas movies mostly deal with family and holiday stories, this one seems to be a little bit raunchier as it focuses on unusual behaviors of the lead characters played by Seth Rogen , Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anthony Mackie . The one-minute video features a reference to Tom Hanks ' \"Big\" as Ethan (Gondon-Levitt), Isaac (Rogen) and Chris (Mackie) play Kanye West 's \"Runaway\" on a giant piano with their feet. The scene channels an iconic scene from \"Big\" in which Hanks played \"Chopsticks\" on similar music instrument with co-star Robert Loggia. Ethan and Isaac step on the keyboard and grab people's attention as they make goofy movements. They are seemingly in a toy store as they are surrounded by toys and parents who buy their children gifts. Chris then joins them with his toy megaphone and makes everyone at the room dance. The movie centers on the three best friends who have spent many nights of Christmas with debauchery and hilarity. Now that they're entering adulthood, the three grown-up men try to end their unusual Christmas tradition. Directed by Jonathan Levine, \"The Night Before\" is scheduled for a U.S. release on November 11. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More The Night Before News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T07:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:58:52.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
