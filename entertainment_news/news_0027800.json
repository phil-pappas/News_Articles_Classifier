Cinema Detroit has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise $50,000 for projection equipment capable of handling the piracy-fighting security encryption that’s become commonplace for films from major Hollywood studios and many smaller art-house distributors. \nFor now, the Guthats can screen unencrypted titles, which usually are lesser-known films that may not have the budget for the process or as much need to battle piracy. But without proper decrypting equipment (which they used to rent through their former landlord), they won’t be able to show popular alternative and offbeat movies like “Grandma” with Lily Tomlin or the mainstream movies that could join their mix. \n“I’d love to show the new James Bond movie ‘Spectre,'” says Paula, envisioning a lineup where major titles rub shoulders with — and help subsidize — the smaller quality films that Cinema Detroit helps bring to the city.

He says now that a disaster didn’t happen and prices have dropped for projectors that used to cost $100,000 apiece. \nStill, $50,000 is a hefty price tag for a smaller operation like the one launched by the Guthats, who both quit their jobs to pursue their dream of bringing indie flicks to Detroit. \nWhat started as a pop-up theater for them has grown over roughly two years into a dependable source of eclectic films -- the kind screened regularly in places like New York, Chicago or Los Angeles but often not here. \nThey were the only theater in the region, for instance, to show “Lost River,” the film that Ryan Gosling directed in Detroit. Now, they are one of two movie theaters operating seven days a week in Detroit, with the other being the Bel Air 10 on the northeast side. \nAnd along with the venerable Detroit Film Theatre, they've become synonymous with indie fare. \nThe Guthats say they are committed to staying open for the long haul. At the moment, they’re working fast. Since their final screening at their old location on Sept. 30, they’ve had just over a week to get their new theater room up and ready for two films starting Friday: “A Better You,” a dark comedy directed by Matt Walsh of HBO’s “Veep”; and “Mississippi Grind,” a road movie about two gamblers played by Ryan Reynolds and Ben Mendelsohn of “Lost River.” Buy Photo \nThe new location of Cinema Detroit on Third Street in Detroit's Midtown is seen on Wednesday October 7, 2015.

Most recently, it had served as a theater performance space. \nThe site is a short walk from Midtown favorites like Avalon Bakery, the Selden Standard restaurant and Slows To Go barbecue takeout. There is room to add a café, which was always part of the Guthats' vision. When their lease at the Burton International School ran out, “we liked the vibe here, and the (potential) café offers a lot more possibilities to mingle, whether it’s with filmmakers or other film lovers,” says Tim. \nThere also are no more flights of stairs for patrons to navigate, as there were at their former home. Cinema Detroit now will be on one level and have a handicapped-accessible rest room, according to the Guthats, who plan to expand to two theater rooms if they meet their crowdfunding goal. \nFor now, there is one theater instead of the two auditoriums they used to have, and movable chairs. They expect to have seating for more than 100 by Friday, or roughly the number in their previous main screening room. Free parking is available in a lot next to the building. \nThe Patronicity campaign runs through Nov. 4 and offers benefits for different levels of giving, from recognition on the Web for the $1 level to a package that covers a private event for the $2,500 level. Unlike with crowdfunding sites that only accept online donations, says Paula, supporters have the option of contributing in person to Cinema Detroit with a check, cash or even a bottle-return ticket.

With nearly 7,000 tickets sold so far this year, he calculates that if each of those patrons made a donation equal to the price of one ticket, Cinema Detroit would meet the $50,000 target. \nAs for what will happen to Cinema Detroit's former home, Burton building owner Joel Landy told the Detroit Free Press about a month ago that he hasn’t ruled out the idea of showing movies at his soon-to-be-vacant auditoriums. “I need someone like the Guthats with the same dedication and passion for good movies,” he said. \nThe Guthats hope the community support they’ve experienced so far will carry over to their Patronicity drive. \nIf their goal is reached, “it makes a statement to the world that Detroit cares about movies,” says Tim. \nContact Detroit Free Press writer Julie Hinds: 313-222-6427 or jhinds@freepress.com. \nCinema Detroit", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:56:13.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
