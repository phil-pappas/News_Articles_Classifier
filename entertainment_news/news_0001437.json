Like I haven’t seen their jive before they did it? If I’m worried about the jive, what about the pasodoble?” Sean Ward attending the 2015 TV Choice Awards (Ian West/PA) \nHe pointed out that they are both in the acting business, and added: “That curse of Strictly rubbish happens with sports personalities … as actors we’re used to it.” \nThe much-referred to “Strictly curse” has seen marriages and relationships ruined when celebrities fall for their professional dance partners. Georgia May Foote arriving at the launch of Strictly Come Dancing 2015 (Ian West/PA) \nThe curse has supposedly blighted contestants’ relationships, with Countdown host Rachel Riley splitting from her husband to start a relationship with dance partner Pasha Kovalev; Susanna Reid separating from partner Dominic Cotton weeks after finishing her stint on Strictly; and Joe Calzaghe confirming he was in a relationship with partner Kristina Rihanoff after splitting with his girlfriend. \nSean’s Corrie character, Callum Logan, was killed off during the nail-biting live episode last week.
