Ebenhack, File) \nLOS ANGELES — Los Angeles prosecutors are reviewing an investigation into a model's accusations that Bill Cosby sexually abused her at the Playboy Mansion, an official said Thursday. \nDistrict attorney's spokeswoman Jane Robison said Thursday that police detectives presented evidence Wednesday afternoon for a possible criminal case. \nThere's no timetable for when a decision will be made on whether to charge the comedian, and it is unclear what charges could be filed. \nModel Chloe Goins met with detectives in January and has accused Cosby of drugging her and accosting her in a bedroom of the Playboy Mansion in August 2008, but the comedian's lawyer has denied the claims, saying Cosby wasn't in Los Angeles at the time. \nAn email seeking comment from Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, was not immediately returned. \nCosby has been accused by dozens of women of sexual misconduct, but most of their claims are barred from being filed as civil or criminal cases due to statutes of limitations. \nGoins was the second woman to meet with Los Angeles police detectives to detail accusations against Cosby. \nProsecutors rejected filing charges against Cosby based on allegations by Judy Huth, a Riverside County resident who is suing the comedian, alleging he abused her in the early 1970s when she was 15 years old. Huth's lawsuit also states the abuse happened at the Playboy Mansion. \nHuth's claims were rejected for a criminal case because the statute of limitations had expired. \nCosby, 78, is scheduled to be deposed in that case Oct. 9. \nFallout from the allegations against Cosby continues, with the University of San Francisco, a Jesuit Catholic school, revoking an honorary degree it presented to Cosby in 2012. The school announced the decision Wednesday, the same day Brown University revoked a doctorate of humane letters it granted Cosby in 1985, and days after Fordham and Marquette universities rescinded degrees they bestowed to Cosby. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:05:47.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
