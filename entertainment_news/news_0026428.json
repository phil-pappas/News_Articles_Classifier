Hide Caption 9 photos: TV reunions we'd like to see Fans are about to get their wish with the revival of \"The X-Files\" in January. Hide Caption 2 of 9 9 photos: TV reunions we'd like to see Claire Danes, left, is likely too busy (fighting terrorism as Carrie Mathison on \"Homeland\") to play Angela Chase on a \"My So-Called Life\" reboot, but we'll settle for a reunion special. What do you think, Danes? (Bess Armstrong, who played Patty Chase on the series, is also pictured.) Hide Caption 3 of 9 9 photos: TV reunions we'd like to see Loyal fans of Paul Feig's \"Freaks and Geeks\" have been waiting for a reboot since the show was unceremoniously canceled in 2000, after just one season on NBC. Some of the cast, such as Seth Rogen and Jason Segel, went on to appear in Judd Apatow's \"Undeclared,\" which also only ran for one season -- this time on Fox. Hide Caption 4 of 9 9 photos: TV reunions we'd like to see The cast members of \"Party Down,\" including Ken Marino, left, and Adam Scott, have been hard at work on their respective film and TV projects since the Starz series was canceled in 2010. Despite low ratings, the comedy received rave reviews. Hide Caption 5 of 9 9 photos: TV reunions we'd like to see Fans of Joss Whedon's \"Firefly\" have been begging for a reboot of some sort since the drama went off the air in 2003. Nathan Fillion, center, now stars on ABC's \"Castle.\" Hide Caption 6 of 9 9 photos: TV reunions we'd like to see Before you note how upsetting \"Saved by the Bell: The College Years\" was -- and don't even get us started on \"The New Class\" -- a \"Saved by the Bell\" reunion could be pretty spectacular. Mark-Paul Gosselaar must think so, too. Why else would he have appeared on \"Late Night With Jimmy Fallon\" as Zack Morris in 2009? Come on, Tiffani Thiessen . Do it for us. Hide Caption 7 of 9 9 photos: TV reunions we'd like to see We love watching Connie Britton, left, on the small screen as Rayna James in \"Nashville,\" but we'd be lying if we said we didn't miss Tami Taylor in \"Friday Night Lights.\" And maybe series star Kyle Chandler, right, could take a break from appearing in movies such as \"Argo\" and \"Zero Dark Thirty\" to appease us? Hide Caption 8 of 9 9 photos: TV reunions we'd like to see Debra Messing is currently solving \"The Mysteries of Laura,\" but maybe she'd be up for reprising her role on \"Will & Grace.\" The comedy -- starring Megan Mullally, Sean Hayes, Messing and Eric McCormack -- ran for eight seasons on NBC.
