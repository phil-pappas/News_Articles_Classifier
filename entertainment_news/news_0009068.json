Questions are raised but not resolved about how Fulgencio Sánchez (a mannequin in a coffin) died and how intrigues among family members will play out. It’s a reminder of how complicated interwoven lives can be under a deceptively smooth surface.\nPatrons receive a flower as a ticket to the home where they’re welcomed as guests at the funeral. Esteban (Robert Moreno) passes out a program and leads the group in praying for the soul of his late father. Esteban’s mother, Fulgencio’s widow, Ana Louise (Phyllis Cicero), wails as she mourns trips they won’t take and an expensive fur she won’t get.\nAna Louise hugs and thanks patrons for paying respects. She launches into a tirade about who she thinks killed her husband. More theories will ensue from her three children, brother-in-law and mother-in-law, along with revelations of family secrets and resentments. The actors usher the guests from one elegant room to another as the drama unfolds.\nUnder the direction of Cora Cardona, the ensemble weaves an impressive sense of reality in this earthy translation by Sara Cardona. Cicero, who can be blisteringly funny as the pampered widow, does a clever split-second pivot from crying to scheming, poking suspiciously at one son, Ernesto, played with simmering, then explosive rage by Omar Padilla, while favoring Esteban (Moreno, revealing telling insecurities under proper demeanor).\nThe daughter, Monica (Jamila Marie, with spitfire anger), is convinced she’ll be cheated out of her due. Meanwhile, Fulgencio’s brother Joaquin (Armando Monsivais, with an opportunistic glee akin to Claudius in Hamlet ), makes his play for his sister-in-law and the house she inherits. Doña Martha (Trich Zaitoon), the mother of Fulgencio and Joaquin, steals her scene as the ill, paranoid matriarch lying in bed upstairs, begging for help and, then — well, we won’t give it all away.\nYou won’t get answers to all your questions at The Wake , but you will get coffee, soda, water and cookies, as Ana Louise serves guests out of her lovely serving set. It’s just a slice of life, but a tasty one.\nAudience members are asked to wear black; the audience and actors will vote on three of the best black outfits after the Oct. 31 performance.\nPlan your life\nContinues through Nov. 1.
