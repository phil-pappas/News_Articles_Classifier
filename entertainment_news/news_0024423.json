The actress-singer told Us Weekly she had to seek therapy after she was fat-shamed following snaps of her in a skimpy bikini back in May. \"I've been working in therapy,\" she told the publication (via Daily Mail Online). \"I'd land at the airport and people would yell out, 'You're fat!' It was awful.\" \"I've been working since I was seven,\" Gomez continued saying. \"This was the first year I ever dealt with anyone talking about my body.\" She then said of her bikini snap that she uploaded on Instagram page, \"Even if I did gain weight, I'm fine. That's what the picture represents.\" A photo posted by Selena Gomez (@selenagomez) on Apr 16, 2015 at 5:39pm PDT Notwithstanding the hurtful fat-shaming, Gomez admitted to Us Weekly that she did draw a silver lining from it. \"Each year, I'm becoming more who I am.
