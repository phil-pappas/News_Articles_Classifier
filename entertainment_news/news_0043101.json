No, I’m not referring to the weather, but to the EcoMobility World Festival 2015 being held in our province’s financial hub this month. Touted as a view of the city in the future, it gives residents and commuters a glimpse of three things: an active street life, social inclusivity and of course, sustainable public transport ( http://www.ecomobilityfestival.org ).\nBut really and truly, how has this blatantly forced initiative gone down? Let’s face it, the last time government compelled us to buy into one of their ideas, we ended up with R1.3 billion worth of eTolls. Do they provide pretty purple lights on the way to Pretoria? Yes! But was it the roaring success that government had hoped it would be: obviously not. As debate rages on, I was helluva sceptical when old Mayor Councillor Parks Tau told the privileged inhabitants of Sandton that he’d be closing some of their roads for the entire month of October.\nBy all accounts, the festival has been a relative success thus far. Speaking to Nokwe Nzimande, accountant at Barclays Capital, she relayed that the flow of traffic into the Sandton CBD has been surprisingly smooth from Bryanston. While I don’t work in the business district itself, I noted with astonishment the distinct absence of cars on the Grayston off-ramp on my way to work this week – there are definitely fewer vehicles on the streets.\nThis links back nicely to one of the festival’s key success factors: showing people the viability of public transport. Nina Mancha, also a Sandton-bound employee, commented that both Park and Midrand Gautrain stations were fuller than usual, with the train being the mode of choice for many. The beauty of public transport extends further than just less traffic though. Carbon emissions are also reduced when people carpool or travel en-masse. Mayor Councillor Tau asserts that Johannesburg contributes 56% to national carbon emissions and is the 13th highest carbon-emitting city in the world, and these are certainly no statistics to brag about (unless of course you work for VW… too soon?).\nI’m acutely aware of the pretty picture I’ve painted – speak to others on the street and they’ll share a different side of the story. Concerns over infrastructure and crime top the list and are undoubtedly valid distresses. Public transport systems need to be improved in order for Sandton to become a truly ecomobile city. Construction of the Rea Vaya route along Katherine Street appears to be well underway, but this is only expected to be finished by late 2016. This, while Sandton’s 100 000 commuters collectively pull their hair out in the interim…\nThe Gautrain debate is an interesting one. Early in 2005, the project was slammed by leftists as a ‘train for the rich’ and when you look at where the stations are positioned, you can’t really argue with them. Areas like Rosebank, Sandton and Hatfield are upper-class (read: white) locales and this breed of Joburger is frankly unaccustomed to plebeian mass mobility. But with this prospect comes the ‘taxi tax’. Include a viable and preferable alternative and watch these economic numbskulls throw their toys out the cot faster than a 2 year old with a shit-filled diaper.\nI glossed over crime a little bit earlier, but it’s also a point that warrants discussion. Many Sandtonites have expressed interest in using public transport but hop into their BMWs anyway when they think about the walk or bike ride into Africa’s richest square-mile. Irony of this aside, how can a lady pedal along merrily with her handbag in tow? How can a young lawyer walk the streets with his technology-chock laptop bag? Once again, valid concerns with EcoMobility addressing these through the widespread placement of JMPD officers on the streets. Crime prevention is going to be a pillar of ecomobility success, and certainly is one that we omit at our peril. Until people are comfortable walking to the bus station at 7.00pm, it’s unlikely they’ll forgo their private vehicles and the comforts that they bring (central locking included). Crime prevention is not an insurmountable hurdle. One need only look at the mass of unemployed people and match that with the need for more policing; it’s the economic equivalent of strawberries and cream.\nAs the calls of “so what!?” begin to louden, I can’t help but ask myself the same question. Where does this put us on 1 November 2015, when the orange cones are removed, the contingencies are abandoned and the train schedules are normalised? While I think that EcoMobility will be lauded as a success, it should serve less as a politicking manoeuvre and more as a window… a window into the future of our money-making metro. With the concerns in this article addressed, Sandton is perfectly poised become the eco-hub it so richly deserves to be: one that is thriving, fluid and mobile, with an eco-echo resounding.\n- The Kraken for www.joproblog.com/blog", "external_links": ["http://www.ecomobilityfestival.org/"], "published": "2015-10-13T15:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:04:12.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
