Both shows will not bow until 2016 and these videos are surely expected to tide fans over until the premiere dates. In the first four minutes of the \"Liars\" winter premiere, fans get to see where the girls are, five years after the summer finale. Ali is teaching and she's writing a letter to the Liars asking them to return to Rosewood just in time for a court hearing for Charlotte abuse case. Aria is on a book tour, Spencer is in D.C., Hanna is on a plane, and Emily is a bartender.

Ashley Benson said Hanna had moved to New York to get into the fashion world. Troian Bellisario dished on her character, \"Spencer's an incredibly intelligent character and she hasn't gotten to realize her full potential [in the past]. For her to be so successful in her career and be in a political world was very exciting for me.\" Emily is attending Pepperdine University while also working as a bartender. Shay Mitchell explained, \"She moves away, too, and I think out of all the girls her time away is probably the hardest. She goes through some things during those five years.\" Of what kind of teacher Ali is, creator I. Marlene King said, \"She's such an inspiring teacher.\" She's also responsible for bringing the girls back together. Moving on to the \"Shadowhunters\" trailer, the video includes a backstory of the main heroine Clary (Katherine McNamara). She initially refuses to accept that she's part of this supernatural world, but later is ready to become a Shadowhunter. Other characters like Clare's love interest Jace (Dominic Sherwood), her friend Simon (Alberto Rosende), fellow Shadowhunters Alec (Matthew Daddario) and Isabelle (Emeraude Toubia), Magnus Bane ( Harry Shum Jr. ) and gun-toting werewolf Luke (Isaiah Mustafa) were previously introduced in a teaser . \n\"You're more powerful than you know\" #Shadowhunters Posted by BuzzFeed Entertainment on Friday, October 9, 2015 \"Pretty Little Liars\" returns with new episodes starting January 12 at 8 P.M.
