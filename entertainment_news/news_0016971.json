Speaking to DC, she said, “The film is female-oriented, and is centred around a ghost (which is me). The story is about the travel tales of of two different people at different times running for their lives, haunted with fear. Usually, ghosts are stereotyped, but in Bayam Oru Payanam, this ghost has a purpose. I chose to work in this film because I wanted to try my hand at something different. When the director narrated the script to me, I was sure this character would click with the audience. Since I had complete faith in my role, I went ahead with it. We shot extensively in Munnar. The film has now been wrapped up. We’re occupied with post-production, and the film is expected to hit screens sometime in December.”\nAccording to Vishakha, this is the most challenging role she has played in her career so far and in fact, the most liberating experience ever. Asked why, Vishakha smiles and answers, “Because I had less makeup in this film.” The actress, who’s busy with projects from Hindi as well regional — Tamil and Telugu industries, says she wants to do more challenging roles. “I neither want to repeat myself nor be typecast. I am not the typical kind of actress. I only do roles that give me satisfaction, and I am very clear about what I want. So, I am quite choosy with my films,” she says. Currently, Vishakha has Valeba Raja with Santhanam coming up.\n entertainment Kollywood Vishakha Singh Oru Payanam Also Read Shah Rukh loves being exploited by me: Farah Khan R.I.P Archie, you will be killed off this July Kapil Sharma is Amitabh Bachchan's first guest on 'Kaun Banega Crorepati 8' BB8: Here's why Gautam Gulati and Sonali Raut were spotted in a supermarket", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151020/entertainment-kollywood/article/vishakha-neither-wants-repeat-herself-nor-be-typecast", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/VISHAKHA%20CUTOUT.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/VISHAKHA%20CUTOUT.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-21T01:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T15:20:09.247+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
