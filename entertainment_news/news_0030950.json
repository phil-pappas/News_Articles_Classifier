He continues to make miraculous progress, taking a few steps in Los Angeles. We couldn't be more overjoyed! We realise Lamar's continued improvement will not be easy, however his unrelenting strength and faith in GOD will pull him through. To everyone from across the nation and around the world who continued to send your love and prayers, we THANK YOU sincerely.\" kidney transplant", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T18:41:54.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
