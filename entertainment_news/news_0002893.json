(Photo: Okeechobee Music Festival) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWhen the inaugural Okeechobee Music and Arts Festival in South Florida was first announced in September , organizers promised a Bonnaroo-type event with a Bonnaroo-type lineup -- and they didn't disappoint. \nMumford and Sons , Kendrick Lamar and Skrillex will headline the first Okeechobee Music Festival, March 4-6 at Sunshine Grove, a campsite in Okeechobee, about a 2 1/2-hour drive from Tampa. Lamar and the Mumfords were literally two of this year's Bonnaroo headliners, in case you were wondering. \nOther acts on the bill: Miguel, Future, Fetty Wap, Big Grams (a.k.a. Outkast's Big Boi and Phantogram), Grace Potter, Jason Isbell, Portugal. The Man, Dr. Dog, X Ambassadors and more. More will be announced soon. \nThree-day passes to Okeechobee went on sale Thursday morning starting at $249.50, which includes tickets to all three days, primitive camping, a \"Pre-Festival\" day on March 3, and more. VIP and RV passes start at $599.
