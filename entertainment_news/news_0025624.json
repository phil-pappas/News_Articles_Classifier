Photo by: Facebook / Helen Wright 3rd October 2015 \nHadley described the comments as \"abhorrent\" on air on Monday morning after the historic NRL Grand Final on Sunday from which Johns was excluded.\nAdvertisement Channel Nine sports director Steve Crawley confirmed the decision to stand Johns down Saturday afternoon.\n\"He will not be on air for any part of our coverage,\" he said at the time.\nThe relationship with Nine was also mentioned by Hadley, who is a paid commentator for Nine's Today Show .\n\"It couldn't have come at a worse time for him,\" Mr Hadley said. \"He's in negotiations with both Channel Nine and Foxtel about his broadcasting future.\"\n\"I hope Andrew understands why he was suspended.\"\nHadley also urged Johns to see this moment as a turning point.\n\"Andrew Johns is at a crossroad in his life and his career. He's 41. And I know he seeks counsel from some wise heads. He needs to wake up to himself. He needs to start behaving himself in a manner befitting one of the game's immortals.\n\"I can't imagine how the other immortals are feeling in light of the comments passed by Andrew Johns. They'd be mortified by them. Mortified.\"\nFoxtel and Channel Nine declined to comment on Monday.\nNine was under pressure last week over AFL Footy Show personality Billy Brownless who described a woman and her daughter walking past a venue as \"strippers\". \nThe AFL subsequently put stars of the AFL Footy Show on notice that management \"doesn't accept\" sexist remarks against women.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T10:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T15:53:37.642+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
