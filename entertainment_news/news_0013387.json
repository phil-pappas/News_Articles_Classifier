Jennifer Lawrence was originally attached to take on the role but she was forced to leave the project after the studio had difficulty to find the male lead. The upcoming movie will center on former MSNBC gossip columnist named Jeannette Walls. The script is based on the journalist's memoir which focuses on her difficult childhood with her \"dysfunctional but vibrant\" family. If Larson takes the job, it will reunite her with director Destin Cretton. He previously directed the critically acclaimed drama \" Short Term 12 \" where Larson earned early awards consideration. Brie Larson will soon be seen in drama thriller \" Room \".
