According to the agreement, Mongolian and Chinese artists are about to unveil an exhibition titled “Melody of Steppe” in the Forbidden City. \nA lot of tourists visit China every year, and they usually go to the Forbidden City. It’s a big opportunity for Mongolia. \n\nWhat’s special about “Melody of Steppe” exhibition? \n\nThe Forbidden City is located behind the Tiananmen Square. Tiananmen Square is the heart of China. Many tourists go to see Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City every year. Tourists will see “Melody of Steppe” while they tour around the Forbidden City. Mongolian traditional arts such as khuumii (throat singing), long singing, and dance will be performed at the opening ceremony of the exhibition. It will attract tourists for sure. \n\nHow many artists will participate in the “Melody of Steppe”? \n\nA total of 40 artists from Mongolia and China will attend the exhibition. They will display over 160 artworks illustrating traditional lifestyle, customs, culture and development of their country. “Melody of Steppe” exhibition will be unveiled at the Mongolian National Modern Art Gallery on December 1. \nChinese artists are skilled in the execution of artwork, and Mongolian artists are more open-minded. I think people will gain positive outlook on Mongolia through this exhibition. \nThis exhibition will help promote Mongolian fine arts, expand relations between Mongolian and Chinese artists, and develop tourism. \n\nCan you tell us which Mongolian artists are participating in the exhibition? \n\nSure. Renowned artists are taking part in the exhibition, namely State Honored Artist and Culture Merit Worker Sh.Chimeddorj, Cultural Merit Artist L.Bumandorj, Cultural Merit Artist D.Gungaa, famous painter D.Badam, who lives in Germany, director of Blue Moon Art Gallery Z.Uyanga, State Honored Artist and sculptor L.Gankhuyag, and T.Nurmaajav. \n\nHow long will the exhibition continue? \n\nThe exhibition will be open to the public from October 20 to November 4. During the exhibition, artists will tour Datun city of China, and will paint the city’s lifestyle and ancient monasteries. An exhibition illustrating the lifestyle of Chinese and Datun people will be displayed in Beijing in 2016. \nIn addition, four Mongolian artists will open their exhibition in Xi’an from October 25 to November 24. \n\nWho is funding the Mongolian artists? \n\nWe have no support. The Mongolian National Modern Art Gallery can’t afford the expense. We are talking to people who are interested in artworks. Mongolians are highly appreciative of fine arts. That’s why we want them to support us. \nShort URL : http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=16570   18  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T15:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:03:29.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
