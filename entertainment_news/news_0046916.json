That lyric, from “Crooked Teeth” off 2005’s “Plans,” seemed to sum up what Gibbard battled with all night.\nPerhaps that song had a significant bite during the first of three hometown sold-out concerts because Gibbard and his bandmates seemed more animated than usual. Saturday’s show made the argument that Death Cab is still evolving, two decades into its career.\nSome of the added punch came from context, since much of the night consisted of songs from the new album “Kintsugi.” Many of these are breakup songs, so even oldies like “Crooked Teeth” found new meaning in a set with significant darkness.\nGibbard began with “No Room in the Frame,” from the new record, and over the course of a two-hour set, Death Cab played nearly every song from “Kintsugi.” Gibbard often added searing guitar riffs, as on “Black Sun.” At times the new material seemed more out of the playbook of Neil Young (who plays Sunday at WaMu).\nMost Read Stories Our state’s greatest gift to the nation just got canceled Roads could be a mess this weekend — and Monday New GM Jerry Dipoto provides more insight into how he’ll turn Mariners around Seven things to know about Seahawks rookie Tyler Lockett Survivor: Gunman spared 'lucky one' to give police message Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. But a softer, kinder Death Cab also showed up Saturday with Gibbard’s solo take on “I Will Follow You Into the Dark.” Even that, though, along with the ethereal “Cath … ,” seemed more vulnerable in the context of heartbreak and lyrical venom.\nGibbard only said a few things from the stage, joking at one point that a friend had asked him to play “Bread of Peasants,” one of the first songs he wrote as a high school student. He didn’t do it, but joked that the song inspired Seattle superband Temple of the Dog’s “Hunger Strike.”\nIt was the kind of humor that can only play in your hometown.\nThe main set ended with another only-in-Seattle moment, straight out of grunge, when Gibbard threw his guitar to the ground before walking offstage. This being Ben Gibbard, he respectfully threw it to the back of the stage away from the audience.\nThe only injuries of the night, either real or imagined, were ones that showed up in the hearts of the characters in Gibbard’s lyrics.\nCharles R.
