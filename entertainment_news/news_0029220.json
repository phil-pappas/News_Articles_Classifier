After movies on boxer MC Mary Kom, sprinter Milkha Singh, athlete Paan Singh Tomar, there are more biopics coming on cricketer Mahendra Singh Dhoni and even hockey legend Dhyan Chand. \nTalking about this trend, Big B said: \"I am not in that league\". However, he said he would welcome a biopic on his father, the legendary poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan. \n\"I will not stop any one who wants to make a film on my dad's life,\" he said. \nThe actor also said that he is spending more time with his family on his birthdays. \n\"Earlier I used to work on my birthday, but of late my family wants to spend time with me... so now the birthday has become a family affair,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T13:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T18:34:15.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
