Emmerdale’s Robert Sugden played by Ryan Hawley (ITV) \nAt the end of October, three secrets will be revealed that will rock the village forever. \nLast week, viewers saw the tables turn for Robert when a mystery assailant shot him in the chest leaving him fighting for his life. \nThe villain of the Dales has many enemies after cheating on wife Chrissie (played by Louise Marwood), not to mention killing Katie Sugden (Sammy Winward) and letting his lover Aaron Livesy (Danny Miller) think he was responsible. Emmerdale’s Lawrence White played by John Bowe (ITV) \nThe main list of suspects also includes Robert’s foster brother Andy Sugden (Kelvin Fletcher), now a widower following Katie’s death. \nLet’s not forget Chrissie’s son Lachlan White (Thomas Atkinson), who feels his step-dad Robert has also betrayed him. As for Katie’s friend Chas Dingle (Lucy Pargeter) – she has vowed revenge. Could Aaron be the one #WhoShotRobert ? @DannyBMiller gives a possible motive and asks YOU to decide… #Emmerdale pic.twitter.com/KAbX3l8Qii \n— Emmerdale (@emmerdale) September 29, 2015 \nLawrence White (John Bowe), Chrissie’s father, has never liked Robert and tried to stop his daughter from marrying the estate manager. Aaron’s close friend Paddy Kirk (Dominic Brunt) has been trying to stop Robert from hurting his pal for some time. \nTalking about the forthcoming episode reveal, producer Kate Oates said: “This won’t be the first time Emmerdale has broken its ‘house style’ of storytelling; but it will be the first time we’ve told a story in a non-linear way. Share article \n“What makes this ‘rewind’ episode special is that we won’t just learn who shot Robert, but two other big secrets that will propel the show into an exciting, emotional and dramatic winter.” Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T20:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:02:14.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
