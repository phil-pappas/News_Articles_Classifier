Patrons of the arts donned hats and mittens to stroll around downtown Battle Creek as the sun set. \nArtists set up in businesses, showing off everything from photography to fibers to tire sculptures. Nick Jakubiak's Tired Pandas, which were a favorite at ArtPrize in 2013, were parked outside of Pastrami Joe's. Fire artists spun and spat flames in front of a crowd at Wave Square. The Battle Creek Model Railroad Club opened the doors to their working train display in the basement of the Worgess Building. \nThis was the first year Battle Creek Chamber of Commerce hosted the event. BCreative sponsored a people's choice award.
