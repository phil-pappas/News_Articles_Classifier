X \nCopy link to paste in your message / Comments (0) \nAuthor J K Rowling has turned down an invitation from her former university to attend a sex themed ball - saying she's too old. The Harry Potter writer, who studied at Exeter University in the 1980s, was offered a free invitation to its Safer Sex Ball - in which students party in their underwear for charity. Organiser Pierre G H Keyzar said: \"If you fancy re-visiting Exeter, hit us up Jo-Jo.\" But Rowling, 50, replied to say she was \"three decades too old\" to enjoy the event. She wrote on Twitter: \"Thanks for the kind invitation! I've got a feeling I'm three decades too old to enjoy this, but you have fun!\" The controversial ball was banned by the university in 2013 amid a scandal involving a sexual act between two students during the 2012 event. It returned last year as a privately run event, and raised #10,000 for Devon sexual health group the Eddystone Trust.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T06:23:44.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
