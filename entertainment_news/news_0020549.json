Is The ‘Twilight’ Star Too Busy With His Career To Walk Down The Aisle? Perry Carpenter \nDespite announcing their engagement earlier this year and the promise of a wedding, it now seems as though Robert Pattinson and FKA Twigs might have to cancel their plans to exchange vows. According to Deadline , the former Twilight stars’ career is getting in the way of the couple’s plans to marry. \nApparently, Pattinson’s busy production schedule is the main reason why the couple have been unable to tie the knot. Along with his upcoming films, which include Queen of the Desert and Life , Pattinson is getting ready to work on his most recent project, High Life . Robert Pattinson has been in Belfast with ‘Sons of Anarchy’ star Charlie Hunnam filming ‘The Lost City of Z.’ [Image via Instagram] \nThe movie centers on the story of a gang of crooks who undergo an experiment in space involving reproduction. The film is directed by Claire Denis, with Pattinson starring alongside Mia Goth. \nAs if these films weren’t enough for the former Twilight star, Pattinson is also set to appear in two more movies, including The Childhood of a Leader in 2015 and The Lost City of Z in 2016. \nWith so many projects in the works, it is clear that Pattinson is working hard on his career in Hollywood and breaking out of the Twilight mold. After all, Pattinson has admitted in the past that he always feel the need to demonstrate his worth. \n“I’ve always had the feeling I need to prove myself: as an actor, a star, a person. That might be how I’ve managed to keep my feet on the ground,” Pattinson told Sunday World . “Although I’ve often wished I had a bigger ego — maybe it would have helped me cope with all the things around me.” \nIs it possible that his busy work schedule is getting in the way of his relationship with Twigs? It could be likely, especially considering Pattinson has had difficulties with managing his personal and professional life in the past. \nAs fans will recall, Pattinson rose to superstardom after his role as Edward Cullen in Twilight . According to Design & Trend , it was during this time in his life that Pattinson first faced his troubles with fame. \n“What is terrible is that I became famous when the world changed. In 2008, everybody had a cell phone, it was the explosion of social media,” he stated. “As a result, the freedom to protect [privacy] has become ultra thin. Not only were all these paparazzi camping outside my house but [there was] this new horde of fans who relayed information on social media. It became unmanageable.” \nSpeaking of dealing with fame, Pattinson recently admitted to NME magazine that he still has issues dealing with fans. \n“It really does affect you,” he admitted in regards to reading online comments from fans. “It’s always that person who’s needling away at you, who you either want to destroy, or convince them to love you.” Since the news broke about their engagement Robert Pattinson and FKA Twigs have been hounded by rumors of a breakup.

That being said, KDramaStars is reporting that their plans to wed had been delayed until later in the year. With Pattinson’s busy filming schedule looming, it is not known when the couple will finally tie the knot if they can find the time to do so at all. \nAlthough Pattinson and Twigs have yet to respond to any of these reports concerning their relationship, an inside source recently told Hollywood Life that there is nothing to be worried about. \n“Don’t take the news as a bad thing – they just want to get it right because they only want to do it once,” the insider stated. “FKA wants it to be perfect and she keeps going back and forth on ideas. She definitely wants it to be amazing, so she keeps thinking of things to add to the festivities!” \nTell us! Do you think that Robert Pattinson and FKA Twigs will make it down the aisle?
