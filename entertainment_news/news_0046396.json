The publication released its first ever 100 Best Workplaces for Women survey results and four local companies made the list. Financial services firm Sage Rutty was No. 26 among a national list of companies. Grocery store Wegmans Food Markets is No. 54; marketing company Dixon Schwabl is No. 58 and ESL Federal Credit Union is No. 59.\nThe magazine's ranking is based off a 58-question survey passed out to 135,689 women who work for 637 different companies. The questions centered on how fair their company promoted workers, if female employees have access to information and leadership, the level of support they get for their personal lives and how inclusive and connected they feel with colleagues. The survey results showed a 95 percent confidence level with a 6.5 percent margin of error.\nRochester wasn't the only New York locale to make the list.\nDumbo Moving & Storage in Brooklyn is No. 61. Marketing firm Peppercomm in Manhattan is No. 64. Syracuse IT firm TCG Player is No. 73 and Westchester County's Acorda Therapeutics was No. 75.\nKJBROOKS@Gannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T19:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:12:55.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
