David and Victoria with sons Brooklyn, Romeo and Cruz (Chris Radburn/PA) \n“It’s interesting going out with him because he gets so much attention,” David said. \n“We normally get people now coming up and saying, ‘Would you mind taking a picture with me?’ and they’re actually talking to Brooklyn rather than myself. And I’m the one that takes the picture!” he told Mike Toolan and Chelsea Norris on Manchester radio station Key 103. \nCheeky Brooklyn’s got so big for his (football) boots, he’s even offered to take his old man out for a slap-up meal. Promoted stories \n“He hasn’t [taken me out] yet but he actually said to me at some point, ‘I will treat you to dinner, Dad’,” the 40-year-old said. \nLike every good dad, Becks was on hand to embarrass his eldest son by revealing they’d had “the talk”. \n“I’ve definitely given him relationship advice. Obviously he’s 16 years old so a few years back we had the talk. But Victoria was in the room and we kind of had a chuckle and he was kind of looking at me as if to say, ‘Why you doing this in front of Mum?’,” he laughed. David and a baby Brooklyn (Phil Noble/PA) \nDavid admitted earlier this year that he’d chaperoned Brooklyn’s first date, sitting just five tables away from the courting couple. \nBut Harper, his only daughter, isn’t about to get such lax treatment when it comes her time to date. \n“Don’t worry about that, when it comes to my little girl’s first date I’ll be right next to her!” he joked. Harper Beckham takes after dad David (Jason DeCrow/AP) \nDavid added that Harper ”can definitely handle herself but I think I’m very happy that she’s got three bigger brothers and her dad as well to look after her.” \nPregnant co-host Chelsea asked the dad-of-four for some tips on parenthood and David waxed lyrical on the soporific effect of Take That’s dulcet tones. \n“Get your sleep in. But then again my little girl actually slept really well and she always has slept well, whereas the boys they hardly slept. \n“With Brooklyn, and we were living in Manchester at the time, every time that it came to night-time you know I literally had to put him in the car and drive around for two hours listening to Take That, because he used to fall asleep to one of the songs.” Brooklyn gets a hug from dad back in 2012 (Mark J Terrill/AP) \nAny guesses which one? \nDavid did get a collective round of “aahs” from listeners as he confessed fatherhood was “hard work but it’s the most pleasurable work that you could ever wish to do”. \nHe chatted to the radio show before his return to Old Trafford on October 14 for a Unicef charity football match.
