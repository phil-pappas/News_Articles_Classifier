Written for the latest \"James Bond\" movie \" Spectre \", it becomes the first theme song in the franchise's history to reach No. 1 in the U.K. singles chart. Smith scored the other record after his debut album, \" In the Lonely Hour \", spent 69 consecutive weeks in the top 10 of the U.K. albums chart. The LP got kicked out of the region just last week, when it dropped to No. 11. The record was previously held by Emeli Sande whose \" Our Version of Events \" spent 63 weeks in the top 10. \"This is so amazing! It's such an honor to be recognized by Guinness World Records,\" said Smith of the feats. \"It's been an unbelievable eighteen months - the album exceeded even my wildest dreams thanks to the incredible support of my fans, and to record the first ever 'Bond' theme to reach No 1 in the U.K. is a real privilege.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T09:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:28:35.089+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
