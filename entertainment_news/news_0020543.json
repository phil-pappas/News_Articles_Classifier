Dahil nga sabi ko, ’pag namatay ako hindi ko na madadala eh,” he told select entertainment press flown in via one of his own planes.\nThe “Happy Life” team searches for the most deserving beneficiaries recommended by local officials, social welfare and civil groups. They have already taped three episodes, Chavit said, with nine more to go to complete the first season.\n“(Halimbawa), pinakamasipag na farmer, na ipinag-aral ’yung anak ng masigasig,” he said. “Tapos iimbitahan ko sa Maynila, bibihisan, patitirahin sa hotel, pakakainin ng masarap. Lahat ng buhay (na nararanasan ng) mayaman…(for) three or four days. Pagbalik n’ya, bago ’yung bahay n’ya. Bibigyan ko ng bagong bahay.”\nChavit stressed, though, that he’s not giving away money just like that.\n“Ayaw kong dole out eh, gusto ko reward system. ’Yung masipag lang, ’yun ang bibigyan.”\nAnd who are his co-hosts on the show? Chavit laughed then quipped, “Iba-ibang magagandang babae!”\nAside from the show, the 74-years-old focuses on managing his many, many businesses.\nOn producing films\nHis life story was depicted in the movie “Chavit” in 2003. After more than a decade, he mulls producing films and eventually making the second part of that bio film.\n“Para matulungan ang industriya (ng pelikula), para matulungan ’yung mga artistang walang hanapbuhay, walang trabaho, kaya gusto kong ituloy,” he said.\nAsked on the kinds of film he has in mind, Chavit said, “Depende sa director ’yan, depende sa story. Pina-process ’yan, pinapag-aralan ’yung theme. Kung anong maganda, ’yun ang gagawin.”\nChavit was introduced to filmmaking by his mother Caridad Crisólogo, a movie producer during her time. On local filmmaking nowadays, he all is for continuous learning and education here and abroad.\n“Kung ikukumpara mo ang mga foreign films kesa dito, maraming dipirensya. So maganda na mag-aral tayo (kung saan nag-aral ang) mga foreign producers para matulungan tayo…”\n“Marami, magagaling nga. (Pero) mas maganda nga kung nag-aral sila. Sabagay, may kasabihan nga na experience is the best teacher, sa kasanayan na lang nila gumaling sila,” Chavit said. (With report from Jojo P.
