In an interview with DJ Whoo Kid, the rapper explains why he refuses to vote for female president. \"Not to be sexist but, I can't vote for the leader of the free world to be a woman,\" he says. \"Just because, every other position that exists, I think a woman could do well. But the president? It's kinda like, I just know that women make rash decisions emotionally - they make very permanent, cemented decisions - and then later, it's kind of like it didn't happen, or they didn't mean for it to happen\" He continues, \"And I sure would hate to just set off a nuke. [Other leaders] will not be able to negotiate the right kinds of foreign policy; the world ain't ready yet. I think you might be able to the Lochness Monster elected before you could get a woman.\" On the contrary, T.I.'s peer, Pharrell Williams , believes \"it's time for a woman to be in there.\" During a visit to \" The Ellen DeGeneres Show \", the R&B singer says, \"Women think about things in a holistic way, it's not so individual. I'm saying I'm happy to be a man, but I love women. The thing is, if we had somebody looking after our country that thought about things as a whole, I just feel like it just would be different.\" \"Not that I don't love our current president, I just feel like it's Hillary time,\" he adds. \"People are like, 'Okay, we need a president that we can play Scrabble and Celebrity with,' but that's not who's gonna solve your problems. You need someone that's gonna take it [seriously].\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T21:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:42:38.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
