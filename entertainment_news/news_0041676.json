A report published by hollywoodlife.com claimed that the divorced couple is expecting a baby, saying “there may be a little bun in the oven”. \nResponding to the report, a representative for the 43-year-old actress denied the rumours. ”It’s not true,” the representative was quoted as saying by Gossip Cop magazine, reports aceshowbiz.com. \nGarner isn’t currently pregnant with her fourth baby and they are not going to dismiss their divorce paper. The two announced their divorce in late June after 10 years of marriage. Following their divorce announcement, the two were said to continue on living in the same property here, though in separate houses, to co-parent their children. \nModified Date: October 11, 2015 5:43 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:11:09.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
