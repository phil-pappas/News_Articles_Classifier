The deduction is in case of senior citizen is Rs 60,000 and Rs 80,000 for very senior citizen (above age of 80 years). The tax benefit is given to the assessee or dependents. The dependents include spouse, parents, brother and sister.\nUnder the existing provisions, a certificate in the prescribed form from a specialist working in a government hospital is required. That specialist can be a neurologist, oncologist, urologist, haematologist, immunologist or any other doctor.\nThe requirement of a certificate from a doctor working in a government hospital was causing undue hardship to the persons intending to claim the deduction.\nGovernment hospitals at many places do not have doctors specialising in such branches of medicine.\n“For this and other reasons, it may be difficult for the taxpayer to obtain a certificate from a government hospital.\n“In view of the above, it is proposed to amend section 80DDB so as to provide that the assessee will be required to obtain a prescription from a specialist doctor for the purpose of availing this deduction,” the Ministry had said in the Union Budget 2015-16.\nThe tax benefit was announced by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in his last Budget speech.\n 14, 2015 6:46 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T02:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:18:18.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
