Blood-stained snow. A triple homicide in a Midwest waffle house. Ah jeez, it could only be the return of Fargo (Channel 4) , the blackly comic crime drama inspired by the Coen brothers’ 1996 film . \nSet in 1979, this was a loose prequel to last year’s debut run which starred Billy Bob Thornton and Martin Freeman. As it’s an anthology series - all the rage on American TV at the moment (see also American Horror Story and True Detective ) - it has a standalone plot, populated by a predominantly new cast of characters. \nHollywood star Kirsten Dunst comes to the small screen as Peggy Blomquist (Photo: FOX) \nTwitchy, trigger-happy aspiring gangster Rye Gerhardt (Kieran Culkin, younger brother of Macaulay ) went to The Waffle Hut diner, hoping to persuade a judge to change her mind about freezing a business associate’s assets. She refused to budge. Things escalated quickly. Soon there were three dead bodies and a fourth still to come, courtesy of a gardening tool. \nPrimary protagonist and state trooper Lou Solverson (father of series one’s Molly, played by Patrick Wilson) investigated the bloodbath, along with laconic local sheriff Hank Larsson ( Ted Danson ). Will Lou trace the murders back to the town’s sinister crime syndicate? And how come hairdresser Peggy Blomquist ( Kirsten Dunst ) was so eerily calm when confronted with a corpse on her car bonnet? \nSon of a birch: Brad Garrett as Joe Bulo (Photo: FOX) \nSuch crime fare was punctuated by bittersweet scenes of both Lou and Peggy’s home lives: kitchen suppers, sick spouses, bedtime stories with young Molly. The period of post-Watergate, post-Vietnam paranoia was evoked via beige interiors, souffle recipe cards and new-fangled IBM electric typewriters. Serial killer John Wayne Gacy and president Jimmy Carter appeared on the TV news, while a certain Republican candidate called Ronald Reagan is set to appear as a character later in the run. \nPerformances were universally excellent. Dunst and Danson were terrific but outshone by Wilson, who was winningly phlegmatic and wearily wise. He looks like being the soul of the show, just like his screen daughter (Allison Tolman) last time out. \n'Winningly phlegmatic and wearily wise' - Patrick Wilson as Lou Solverson (Photo: FOX) \nThis opener didn’t immediately grab viewers by the puffy parka lapels. The opening 10 minutes meandered somewhat bafflingly, before the story sparked into action to become a pacy thrill-ride. It felt like an arthouse take on a cowboy film, with goodies and baddies being slowly drawn together for a reckoning. \nThere were stylistic nods to the Coens, as you’d expect, but also Tarantino (in the B-movie designer violence), Scorsese (cocaine-snorting gangsters) and Coppola (the King Lear-like mob family rivalry). The diner scene was shot partly from outside, lit like an Edward Hopper painting. Further flourishes included use of split-screen and a prominent, coolly curated soundtrack. \nBreaking Bad fans will recognise Jesse Plemons as Ed Blomquist (Photo: FOX) \nAll this was combined with the now-familiar Fargo tropes: cars driving down deserted snowy highways, small-town hopes and frustrations, sudden bursts of brutality and characters with neighbourly “Minnesota nice” accents: “The what now?”“Well, this is a deal.”“Sure is.” \nLast year’s debut series was an unexpected treat, going on to win a cabinet full of Emmy and Golden Globe gongs . This follow-up is already equally promising. Oh yah, you betcha.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T07:16:07.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
