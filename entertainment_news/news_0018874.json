My husband was earning $75,000 a year at a startup. Within a year, he had a lot of business travel. Over the next few years we had two children, now ages 5 and 7. When our first child was born we bought a big house and lived in it while I hired and directed contractors to pull out the core and construct a modern home inside a 100-year-old facade.\nAt this point my husband started his own company. He spent more time on the road. Eventually a few employees told me, you should excuse the expression, what was up. When confronted, he admitted he had an affair, claimed he still loved me, and dumped the Trixie. Now, three years on, he is rarely home. I want a divorce. He tells me his company is worth about $4 million. Others tell me the number is north of $20 million. What is my best way forward?\n— H.S., West Roxbury\nA You need an experienced family law lawyer who hires a top-notch business appraiser. We often retain Steve Bravo, Apogee Business Valuation. He knows what he’s doing and is a straight shooter who calls it as he sees it, no matter who hires him. Then the value will be the value.\nAnd if the judge finds the facts as you’ve told them to me, you should get, net of mortgages and loans, half the value of the business and your husband should get half the value of the house.\nYou may want to keep half of your husband’s shares hoping the company will go public so you’d end up with tons of money. But your husband will want to keep control over the business by having your shares put into a trust. He’d have the right to vote the shares. You’ll have the right to decide how to spend trust assets and the right to sell the shares — maybe with your husband having a right of first refusal. There are many other things that the trust needs to say to protect you.\nThere are other things to work out such as alimony, child support, who will be the primary custodial parent, and how much parenting time the other parent will have.\nOf course you might want to cash out now because you think the company won’t last too long. If so, your husband would likely only want to pay you an amount that is less than half the value. But you may believe $1 million in the bank is better than $5 million in the bush. If you go that route, and in a few years the company goes public and is a big hit on Wall Street, don’t think you could go back to court and get a re-do. If that happens, pray you can learn to live on your money in the bank based on what you thought, back then, was a good deal.\nGerald L.
