The psychedelic posters are from the period 1969-74. A wonderful, if preposterousy turbulent, period in Stockton history. The Bay Area rock scene spilled over into Stockton in all its revolutionary, paisley-clad, hallucinogenic glory. “In Stockton, that was the very first poster we did,” recalled artist Thomas Morris, 69, of Pleasant Hill. “We all got in a big VW van, higher than a kite, and drove down. It was quite a deal.” Morris, sometimes working with a partner, designed most of the posters for San Joaquin events of that era. They rolled off Jelly Roll press, the manifesto-publishing heart of hippiedom. The posters chronicle a procession of great rock acts playing Stockton and surroundings, at venues such as Pacific’s stadium, Oak Park’s ballpark and the Civic Memorial Auditorium: Santana, Ike and Tina Turner, Bo Diddley, Sons of Champlin, Jefferson Airplane, Steve Miller, Cold Blood. Concord poster collector Kent Wood spent years searching for Morris’ posters before digitizing them and issuing the Blue Moon prints. “Actually, I did go to some of the shows,” said Wood, 68. “That Gold Rush poster? That was the best one-day concert that I ever went to.” My personal favorite beyond any doubt is the poster for the 1973 Fleetwood Mac concert at Billy Hebert Field, which I attended. It’s a lovely poster. That was the infamous concert in which Stockton police tear-gassed concertgoers. A riot broke out. The pandemonium was crazy. Rolling Stone magazine did a big article on it. The ballpark was trashed, scads of cops were injured, the hoosegow filled with concertgoers, citizens were terrified and the benighted city manager outlawed music in the parks. Ah, memories.
