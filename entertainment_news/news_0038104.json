Over the course of a nearly 45-year career, the singer-songwriter has touched on a wide range of musical genres — from folk and jazz to blues, pop and rock — without giving a thought to what was popular at the time. \n\"I don't buy a lot of records or constantly listen to music, but I like different things,\" Armatrading said by phone. \"When I'm writing I don't generally think, 'I must write a blues song or I'm going to write a rock song.' \" \nArmatrading, who performs on Thursday in South Orange, is in the midst of her final major world tour, during which the singer-guitarist-pianist is performing without a backup band. \nIt's the first time Armatrading is touring without accompaniment since the Caribbean-born, England-raised musician's first American shows in 1973. The career-spanning concert will feature such hits as \"Love and Affection,\" \"Drop the Pilot\" and \"Me, Myself I.\" \nArmatrading will also narrate an intimate photo montage of her career. \n\"For the last major tour it makes sense to go solo since I only did it once before in the beginning of my career,\" she said. \n\"I write all my songs on piano and guitar, and I just had to rewrite the arrangements on some of them.\" \nWhile several bands in recent years have said they would cease extensive touring only to book long engagements within a couple of years, Armatrading said that won't happen with her. \n\"I will play again,\" she said. \"But my tours have always been extensive. I began this tour when I was 64, and I will be 65 two weeks after the tour ends. After the age of 65, I don't want to be on the road 18 months or a year, or even six months.\" \nArmatrading began playing the piano in her family's home as a child, though not at her parents' urging. \"My mother bought a piano because she thought it would be great as a piece of furniture,\" she said. \"As soon as the piano arrived I started playing it. \n\"I didn't have a clue whether I was playing a D chord or a C-minor, but it sounded nice. \"I just knew that if I put my hands on the keys and then moved them somewhere else it would make music. I started making up these little tunes.\" \nShe soon taught herself to play guitar as well, and began performing at age 16. At age 22, Armatrading released her debut album, \"Whatever's for Us.\" She broke through commercially on her self-titled third album in 1976, which hit No. 12 on the U.K. album charts. The record was driven by the British No. 10 single, \"Love and Affection\" — the ballad remains arguably her most popular song. \nArmatrading made a further splash in 1980 with \"Me, Myself I,\" an upbeat collection of rhythm-and-blues-infused rock and pop. Buoyed by the title track, the album reached No. 5 on the British albums chart and No. 28 in America, her highest career chart rankings in both countries. \nThe 1983 follow-up, \"The Key,\" featured the buoyant \"Drop the Pilot,\" her most successful U.S. single (No. 33). Later popular efforts included \"Hearts and Flowers\" (1990), \"Square the Circle\" (1992) and \"Lover's Speak\" (2003). Armatrading's last three albums are a trilogy, the only discs in her career that focus on a specific style of music. \"Into the Blues\" (2007) hit No. 1 on the Billboard Blues chart and earned a Grammy nomination. \"This Charming Life\" (2010) embraced rock, and \"Starlight\" (2013) focused on jazz. Armatrading said her next album will not be tied to one genre. \"I have no idea what it will sound like,\" she said. \n\"I have to wait as much as everyone will.\" © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T07:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:10:07.178+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
