Photo: JasonSouth \nSometimes he's a demon, sometimes he's a man. The recurrent figure in the late artist Andrew Sibley's last series of drawings, a nursing attendant named Felix, appears different and distorted, depending on Sibley's mood.\nAs Sibley recovered from a bad fall earlier this year, and shortly before a decline that led to his death in September, he started to draw again – residents of the rehab hospital in which he was recuperating, his grandchildren, Felix. His memory shot and his concentration affected, Sibley astounded his loved ones by his ability to put pen to paper.\n\"Even though he so struggled with his actual enunciation and formatting of sentences...the mechanics of drawing, the eye and the hand, the ability to compose stuff and to format stuff on paper just never diminished,\" his son, Ben, said. \"He's always had it.\"\nThese drawings form part of a new exhibition at Collingwood's Kick Gallery, Andrew Sibley: Early Paintings Last Drawings . They are the bookend to a show that looks back at work from as early as the 1960s, about a decade before Sibley moved into a more radical, contentious period that divided local audiences.\nAdvertisement Jacob Hoerner​, a long-time friend of Andrew's son Ben and the director of Kick Gallery, said his drawings show how essential art still was to Sibley, even at the end of his life, and how they seemed to strip his work away from the colourful and romantic palette he'd experimented with in recent years and back to his moody origins.\n\"I thought Andrew's output of drawings came from a very fundamental, primary response to the world around him,\" he said. \"He'd fallen into a manner which he said in his career that he'd never do but then this hit on the head sort of reset everything.\"\nSibley suffered a fall in January and was in hospital, rehab or a nursing home from that point until his death in September. By April, his son had set him up with easels and paper, hoping that it would help with his recovery.  \n\"As soon as I saw him do his first couple of drawings I thought this is a way for him to still express himself,\" he said. \"For example, you might be in conversation with him and he would be on a different topic area within two sentences but he would be able to draw for an hour without breaking concentration. His muscle memory would just kick in.\"\nSibley, an Archibald finalist more times than his family care to remember, noted lecturer at RMIT and Monash universities and a dedicated figurative painter through his five decades-long career, has enjoyed a resurgence of interest in his work after Hoerner staged some major exhibitions of his shows.\nThe plans were already in place for an exhibition in October but Sibley's unanticipated health issues and subsequent death created a more poignant dimension.\n\"He was always driven to paint, he would have painted anyway,\" Ben Sibley said. \"If you locked him away in a castle he would still be painting.\"\nAndrew Sibley: Early Paintings Last Drawings is at Kick Gallery until October 18.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:23:31.286+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
