Horn Theatre on the College of Southern Nevada campus in North Las Vegas.\nIt was the most ambitious project Director Emily Rawlings and her assistant directors, Erika Comparoni and Bailey Hinz, had planned with the group.\nRawlings' company, Dynamic Music Therapy, conducts an hourlong music therapy class for Down syndrome students every Wednesday. Her students are from 16 to 50 years old. Music is used to encourage interaction and teach social skills.\nThe \"Beauty and the Beast\" production involved auditions and weekly rehearsals. There also were several \"build days,\" for cast members and volunteers to create the colorful background scenery.\nThe production included scenery, costumes, makeup, music and a professional stage with theater sound and lighting. The actors and actresses knew their roles, but they only saw the large Horn Theatre stage the day of the performance, and for some of the cast, the large stage caused a bit of confusion. Therefore, as scenes progressed, assistance from the directorial staff quietly placed the actors correctly.\nFamily members in the audience said their Down syndrome relatives were so excited about the opportunity to be onstage that they insisted weeks ago that the families be available to attend the show. As a result, the 524-seat theater was at least three-quarters full for the free show.\nKatie Kremer narrated \"Beauty and the Beast\" between pre-taped musical interludes. Katie's mother, Jenny Kremer, said her 32-year-old daughter originally wanted to play the lead part of Belle, but was cast as the narrator, an important role that kept the story moving. Katie practiced her part every day, Mom said. Her speech therapist also attended the show.\nThe cast clearly loved the large ensemble songs, with the highlight seeming to be, \"Be Our Guest.\" That scene involved people, candlesticks, silverware, plates, teapots and characters all moving to the music. The audience reaction was so enthusiastic some of the cast members even took bows as the song ended.\nMost of the actors had multiple roles. Cierra Bain, for example, was a townswoman, horse, silverware and candlestick. Megan Oyler was an enchantress, townswoman, plate, tree and silverware. Bookie Williams, Brianne Treants, David Abraham, Kevin Rutter, Lee Wittke, Matt Fiscus, Noah Martinez, Sara Beldy and Tina Tiberi also all had multiple roles. Because of illness, Natalie Benda was not in the show \"though she really wanted to be,\" the director said.\nThe main characters were Belle (Sara Novak), the Beast (Peter Holmquist) and Gaston (Troy Watkins). Other named characters were LeFou (Ryan Scrivens), Lumiere (Matthew Tan), Cogsworth (Owen Largon), Mrs. Potts (Chantale Hicks), Chip (Nick Calarco) and Maurice (Edwin Solano). At the end of the show, director Rawlings gave each cast member a red rose.\nDuring the long preparation period for the show, the students became friends, often greeting each other with hugs. If the gossip among the parents and grandparents is to be believed, two cast members, David and Tina, have become boyfriend and girlfriend. The two consider themselves \"dating,\" but because they don't drive, family members drive to a restaurant and let David and Tina sit at a separate table.\nThe families of Down syndrome children became friends, too. As the audience members entered the theater for the show, many of the adults greeted each other as longtime friends, asking about their families.\nThe audience applauded after each scene in the show. The production ended with a standing ovation.\nLocal music therapy classes for Down syndrome students began more than a decade ago. Rawlings started working with the group through another company in 2007. When that company dissolved, she established her own company in 2011 specializing in working with the disabled. Today, her classes with the Down Syndrome Organization of Southern Nevada regularly have 25 students.\nHer satisfaction? \"Working with a group that generally has a positive outlook whenever they are in class, and then seeing the students blossom,\" she said.\n\n6 things to do on a budget...
