Matthew Gilmour (son of David and Ginger) releases his album titled 'The Grey'. David Gilmour releases his solo album 'Rattle that Lock'.\n\"Despite living in separate houses, separate lives, the Family Affair still carries on creatively,\" says Ginger with a smile. \"It is such an energetic period to be living, especially watching our children's artistic flowering within the wings of our support,\" she adds.\nMatthew Gilmour has released his first solo album titled 'The Grey' which has received high acclaim from all who have listened. \"I am extremely proud of him. He has climbed a great mountain,\" says Ginger. \"It has been amazing to watch him grow into the artist he has become. It is only the beginning,\" she adds. Matthew's website is www.matthewgilmour.com\nThe album contains 11 cuts containing 10 of Matthew's original material, recorded in Texas at the private recording studio of musician/producer Danny Johnson of Steppenwolf and tweaked and mastered by James Guthrie of Pink Floyd fame. \"Matthew is someone to be reckoned with. The world needs to hear his music!\" says James.\n'Memoirs of the Bright Side of the Moon' is Ginger's personal way of thanking David for such a wonderful adventure-filled life (a story never told before).\nIt consists of 653 pages, 140 photographs and 90 descriptive stories as she walks us thru individual chapters of her life ... glimpsing her heart as you meander down the hallways of her life, pausing & peeking inside a closet or two. A one of a kind life that takes you to secret beach hideaways in the Greek Islands to a remote Middle Eastern village where the likes of Mick Jagger frolic within a hidden world unknown to fans. Ginger's life has crossed paths with a list of Rock n' Roll's biggest stars, spiritual teachers, therapists, friends AND adversaries who have helped to guide her to Live, Let go, Forgive and Love God.\nHer self-published book itself has been described as a work of art by fans who have already received it. The book is Not a Tell-All but a collection of self-revealing stories of love, truth, motherhood and creativity. Through her artwork and self-belief that she shares, it is evident Ginger's passion is to uplift others' hearts beyond the challenges and to remember the Beauty that they are.\nIt is a must have for those who want to glimpse the other side of the Wall. It is brimming with content that will enlighten anyone who was part of that Rock n Roll Era or has ever dreamt that they could have been.\n'Memoirs of the Bright Side of the Moon' can be ordered thru Ginger's website: www.angelscript.com .\nWant to discover more?\nGinger is available for print, radio, television and SKYPE interviews.\nContact Information :\nIsaac Ian\nT: +1 800-681 1358\nE: Isaac@angelscript.com\nW: www.angelscript.com\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151014/277133\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/return-to-the-bright-side-of-the-moon-memoirs-of-ginger-gilmour-300160164.html\nÂ©2015 PR Newswire.
