COTTER Posted Oct. 19, 2015 at 12:09 PM » Social News For its first concert of its 56th season, the Hudson Valley Philharmonic, under the direction of Randall Craig Fleischer, presented “This Land,” composer David Amram’s variations of Wood Guthrie’s “This Land is Your Land” and “Red River Valley.” Amram was on hand at the Bardavon in Poughkeepsie Saturday night to introduce his work and comment on its origins: He wanted to tell the story of Guthrie’s travels from the west to New York City and how his music mirrored the places he visited and lived in. Also on the program were Samuel Barber’s Adagio for Strings and Shostakovich’s Fifth Symphony. “This Land” opens with “Theme and Fanfare for the Road: Oklahoma Stomp Dance,” a powwow drum roll that sets off at a galloping pace, followed by “Sunday Morning Church Service in Okemah,” Guthrie’s hometown. A slow mournful hymn develops “This Land” as a reverent tribute to the religious past with oboe, harp and horn sharing the melody. “Texas Barn Dance” sounds a hoedown and Irish folkdance with trombone leading the tune, while “Dreaming of Mexico” calls on trumpet and tuba in jubilant Latin rhythms. For “Dust Bowl Dirge” strings evoke the swirling dust and oppression. The work closes with “Street Sounds in New York” with a set of variations on Caribbean festival march, Jewish wedding, Salvation Army hymns and jazz to end on an upbeat flourish. Amram’s “Themes and Variations on ‘Red River Valley'” featured flute soloist Marcia Gates in a virtuoso performance that followed the melody through sonorous configurations and colorful climax. Samuel Barber’s Adagio for Strings is a justly popular audience favorite with its haunting melodic lines and taut harmony. It rises slowly on an arch to a heart-stopping climax that falls to a short repetition of the dominant chord. The orchestra strings played it with quiet feeling and perfect pacing. Photographs of the dust bowl were projected to accompany the Adagio. After intermission, Fleischer led the Philharmonic in an exciting version of Shostakovich’s Symphony No. 5 in D minor (1937). With the first four-note theme announced by the violins listeners are immediately caught up in an emotional journey of personal anxiety, hope and resolution in triumph. A second three-note theme underlines the conflicting aspirations that lead to a march that first attempts to drown out the dream and then moves to support it. The composer then shows his humorous side with a brief extroverted scherzo of skipping phrases. The largo runs deep with strings expressing a sorrow and longing for fulfillment, with wind interludes breathing relief. After a resonant climax, a coda with harp and celesta brings ultimate rest, before the storm of the final allegro. Timpani recall the first theme and build to a full tutti with xylophone bridging the way to a finale of immense scope and resonance with brass and drums marching to a last forceful recapitulation. Fleisher and company well deserved the standing ovation of the audience. He conducted with focus, genuine expertise and energy, and they responded accordingly. By JAMES F.
