(508) 869-6887; www.calliopeproductions.org \" 'Waiting for Godot' frankly jettisons everything by which we recognise theatre. It arrives at the custom house, as it were, with no luggage, no passport and nothing to declare: yet it gets through as might a pilgrim from Mars.\" The English theater critic Kenneth Tynan's review of Samuel Beckett's \"Waiting for Godot\" 50 years ago helped set the stage for the work to be considered by many the most significant play of the 20th century. However, Dave Ludt, artistic director of Calliope Productions in Boylston, recently discovered that Beckett's own revision of his play in 1975 is \"a version that most theater-goers have never had the chance to see.\" Rather than waiting around, Ludt went to the British Library in London, England, to see things for himself. Calliope's production of \"Waiting for Godot,\" which opens at 7:30 p.m. Oct. 15 at the Calliope Theater for seven performances, will use a specially revised version of the script based on Beckett's hand-written notebook for the 1975 staging of the play he directed at the Schiller Theatre in Berlin, Germany. Ludt directs a cast of Dwight Patten, Mark Durrenberger, Michael Casey, John Goodale and Elizabeth Schwartz. Putting on \"Waiting for Godot\" is \"something that's totally unlike anything we've done at Calliope in the past 30 years,\" Ludt said. Calliope usually stages musicals and comedies. Nevertheless \"Waiting for Godot\" is a play that's \"been in the back burner for a while because it's one of those seminal works of modern literature,\" Ludt said of his own intentions to stage a production. In the play two men, Vladimir and Estragon, are waiting for a person named Godot on a barren road by a leafless tree. They pass the time with mundane activities, trivial conversations, and more serious reflection. They also contemplate whether they should hang themselves. Their conversation is interrupted by two passers-by, a slave/servant, Lucky, tethered by a rope to his master, Pozzo. Pozzo has Lucky do a dance and a \"think,\" which descends into incoherence. They leave, and Vladimir and Estragon are still waiting. A boy arrives to say that Godot will not be appearing that evening \"but surely tomorrow.\" At the start of the second act, the tree has sprouted some leaves and Vladimir and Estragon are back, waiting for Godot … Beckett (1906-89) was an Irish playwright, poet and novelist who spent many years in France, including during the Nazi occupation, during which he served with the Resistance. In bleak post-war Europe, \"Waiting for Godot\" struck a nerve. It was first performed in French in 1953 and in English in 1955. Beckett subtitled the English language version of his play \"A Tragicomedy in Two Acts.\" Ludt had already decided to put on \"Waiting for Godot\" as part of Calliope's 2015 season and was doing research, \"toying with doing a modern adaptation,\" when he read about Beckett's theatrical notebook for the 1975 production. He said he could not find a published version, so \"I set about trying to find out where I could access Beckett's notes, so that I could take advantage of the 'updating' that Beckett did. After a few weeks of searching, I discovered that the British Library in London has copies of Beckett's notebooks for not only 'Waiting for Godot' but also all the other plays that Beckett revised and directed in the 1970s and 1980s,\" Ludt said. This was \"fortuitous\" since Ludt had already planned a vacation trip to London for this past August. He applied for and received a library card at the British Library and spent two days reading Beckett's own production notes. \"The experience was like looking over Beckett's own shoulder and hearing his own thoughts as he was in the act of polishing and perfecting his play,\" Ludt said. \"Waiting for Godot\" was Beckett's first play, and Ludt said he had acknowledged his inexperience and expressed a desire to \" 'give shape to the confusion of the play.' \" Also, \"We know that he was not very happy with some of the productions he saw.\" Ludt said. \"That was a motivation.\" What Ludt found was \"The re-thinking that Beckett did in order to direct this play in Berlin resulted in hundreds of changes - in the form of cuts and revisions, as well as changes in stage directions and reinterpretations of characters.\" Beckett eliminated about 100 lines, including at the end of the first act, making the ending \"more mysterious,\" Ludt said. \"There is less violence, less anger. There seems to be greater bonding between Vladimir and Estragon.\" Time is \"Not only 'waiting,' but how much time factors into life.\" Speaking of time, the revisions make for a shorter play. \"I think it's a much better play. Tighter,\" Ludt said. \"I think the audience will be able to relate a little more to the characters. And it's a little more reflective.\" With regard to the \"tragicomedy\" subtitle, he said, \"there is a comic element to it. By de-emphasising the violence, it makes the comedy come forward a little more.\" Nevertheless, the play remains \"a bear to learn. So many non-sequiteurs, so many esoteric references. It's a challenge, and it's also an accomplishment when you do it.\" There have been plenty of discussions with the cast about what it is all about. \"With every rehearsal we know a little more,\" Ludt said. \"Beckett himself said he doesn't know who Godot is - 'If I had known who Godot was I would have said so.' It's like a jigsaw puzzle. You may not have the whole picture but you have a general concept.\" One concept among some observers is that Vladimir and Estragon are waiting for God. \"If they are waiting for God in a theological and philosophical way, why would someone who lives outside this world lower himself to visit?\" Ludt pondered. \"I think it's kind of interesting to have these conversations with the cast.\" There is ambiguity in the play and our conversations about it, Ludt acknowledged. \"The ambiguity as in waiting for an explanation. But I think it's good for the soul.\" Contact Richard Duckett at Richard.Duckett @telegram.com.
