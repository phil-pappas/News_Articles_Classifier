The actor who plays Cosby's son on the sitcom tells The Associated Press that sexual assault allegations against Bill Cosby has destroyed the show's legacy. \"My biggest concern is when it comes to images of people of color on television and film, no matter what ... negative stereotypes of people of color, we've always had The Cosby Show to hold up against that. And the fact that we no longer have that, that's the thing that saddens me the most because in a few generations the Huxtables will have been just a fairy tale,\" he says. Warner says that he has been in touch with Cosby but refuses to reveal their conversation. \"I think the things that we discussed really have to stay private between us. But it's just a bad situation all around - for him, for his family, the women, their families, the legacy of the show,\" he says. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T20:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:33:39.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
