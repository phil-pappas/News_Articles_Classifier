He is unafraid in his artistry,” added Motion Picture Academy Chief Executive Dawn Hudson. \nSIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter >> \nRock, who previously hosted the show in 2005, killed it on the awards circuit last year. He earned plaudits for his comic-in-crisis movie “Top Five” and made a number of seasonal appearances, including a scene-stealing turn at the National Board of Review ceremony, where his remarks were as sharply funny as these appearances get. (Sample line, regarding the Sony hack: “Scott Rudin is not a racist. Scott Rudin hates everybody.”) He also continued to show he's right in the thick of a boundary-pushing zeitgeist when he directed Amy Schumer's recent HBO special at the Apollo. \nWhether that edginess will resonate in at the at-times thin-skinned Dolby Theatre room, however, is an open question. Pressing buttons, with either the assembled talent or on larger cultural issues, is what Rock is especially good at -- and what the Oscars are famously resistant to. Rock could tone it down, of course, but then he wouldn’t really be Chris Rock. \nChristopher Julius \"Chris\" Rock III has been called one of the greatest stand-up comics. He's also a producer, director, writer and actor. Let's look at career highlights. \nThe performer's first turn, though filled with comic gems, is often remembered for the onstage sparring with Sean Penn, who took umbrage at Rock’s take on the viability of Jude Law, of all people. Rock's performance was beloved by his hard-core fans and many critics, but ended up on some lists of questionable award-show hosting turns. \nAnd edgy didn’t go over so well at the Oscars in recent years with Seth MacFarlane or Neil Patrick Harris; more popular and well-received was the softer, selfie-taking precincts of Ellen DeGeneres. \nAlmost as important for ABC and producers as the Hollywood reaction are the audience numbers. The Oscars showed double-digit drops last yea r among total viewers and adults 18-49, part of a larger downward pattern in recent years, and the hope is that a new host and producers can stem the tide. \nRock does have some mainstream drawing power — possibly. His 2005 turn was a bridge of sorts from an era when many people watched the awards to an era when not so many people watched the awards. The roughly 42 million people who tuned in to his first show set a high mark for the eight years that followed, unbroken until DeGeneres’ telecast in 2014. \nBut Rock’s Oscars also showed a decline from what came before — dropping by about 1.5 million from the prior year and proving the fourth lowest total of the previous 15 years. (And one of the others year was the weird Iraq war-set ceremony of 2003.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:36:35.927+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
