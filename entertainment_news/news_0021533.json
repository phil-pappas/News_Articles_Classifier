Rough Cut (no reporter narration).   \nROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) Bill Cosby testified under oath for about seven hours on Friday in response to a civil suit brought by a woman who accuses the veteran comedian of sexually abusing her when she was 15, a lawyer for the plaintiff said on Saturday. It was the first time Cosby, 78, testified under oath since dozens of women came forward over the past year with accusations of sexual misconduct, some of which date back to the 1960s. He has never faced criminal charges over the allegations. The plaintiff's attorney Gloria Allred gave few details of the deposition in Boston, the exact location of which was not disclosed. Due to a protective order by the judge, she said she could not answer questions about Cosby's testimony. \"We'll be filing motions with the court in connection with the deposition,\" Allred told reporters. \"We'll also be seeking to take a further deposition of Mr. Cosby at a later date.\" Friday's deposition related to the California civil suit brought by Judy Huth, who accuses the former star of \"The Cosby Show\" of forcing her to perform a sex act at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles in 1974 when she was aged 15. Lawyers for Cosby, who have previously called Huth's allegations \"false and defamatory\", could not immediately be reached for comment. Cosby, who played a beloved father figure in the sitcom that ran for years on U.S. television, previously gave a deposition in a Pennsylvania case that he eventually settled out of court nearly a decade ago. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Craig Karlan has said he would seal the depositions in the California case until he can review the transcript and decide which parts to make public. He is expected to make that decision by Dec. 22.  //reut.rs/1Zqdbc7", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T06:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:25:09.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
