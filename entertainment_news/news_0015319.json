When I meet fans, they're quite creative and intelligent, kind, sensitive. Some are old ladies, witch doctors from Louisiana, kids that have just left art school. Gay or lesbian couples, straight middle-aged couples...I'm honest, and that comes out.\"\nAs for remaining shtum regarding her very famous fiancee, and the backlash she received since news broke of their relationship, the singer added: \"I’m not affected by what fans would think, or by people critiquing what I do.\" That aside, she was happy to reveal her life plan, and it's - in her own words - very traditional.\n\"I grew up in Gloucestershire, and there's a certain format that people fit into. And I'm actually quite happy with that format. I'm quite happy to say, ‘Go to school, work hard on your GCSEs, do your A-Levels, get married, have children. I just like working hard and learning things. I do this because I want my children to have a nice life, and I want my children's children to have a nice life. And I want my grandkids to be proud of what I've achieved. And I want to be a role model, but not for the world. I don't mind about that -- that'll come or it won't come. It's no different from being a car salesman. Imagine if I said to a car salesman, ‘Why are you doing that?’ [They'd say] ‘Cause I want to work hard, and I want to have a nice life, and when I have kids, I want to be able to buy a house.’ It's still the same values.\"\nMORE: A lot of people are saying that this guy's viral cover of 'Shake It Off' is better than the original\nMORE: Watch: Julianne Moore, James Corden act out soap opera only using Taylor Swift Lyrics\nMORE: Pics: Brad Pitt (who's reportedly in Co.
