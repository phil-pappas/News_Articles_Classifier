Its convex and concave forms are used to give the viewer an experience of \"the connectedness of existence,\" according to the gallery. \n“Seeing, touching, and the physical sensory engagement is the way into my sculpture,” Pepper said in a statement.” [M]y intention is that the meaning of my work rests in experiencing it, similar to the performing arts where listening and seeing the moments of a performance where meaning is revealed through experience.” \nPepper was born in Brooklyn in 1922 and trained as a painter, but a 1960 trip to the Angkor Wat temple complex in Cambodia inspired her to begin working as a sculptor. \nA recipient of the International Sculpture Center’s Lifetime Achievement Award, Pepper has displayed her work in museums and galleries near and far, including the Brooklyn Museum, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and most recently, Museo dell’Ara Pacis, in Rome. \nThe installation in Union Square is a result of the combined efforts of the Union Square Partnership , the Parks Department, and Marlborough Gallery.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T22:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:02:02.630+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
