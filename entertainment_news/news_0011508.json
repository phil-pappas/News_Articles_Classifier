The reason we are still proceeding with it because it was not planned after the unfortunate demise of Kalamji. The team had planned the song earlier and we had plans to make Kalam Sir launch them.\nUnfortunately, we lost him. But we are continuing with the plan and are launching the song on Dr APJ Abdul Kalam's birth anniversary.\" The film stars Irfan, Deekshitha, JP and Riyaz Khan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:29:41.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
