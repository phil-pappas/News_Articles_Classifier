Some of the activities enjoyed most by young ‘uns include face painting, pumpkin painting, a bounce house, and other fun pastimes. Of course, there is also plenty to see and do for attendees of all other ages too.\nCrafters will present a great variety items and homemade goods and products. There will also be loads of food vendors onsite to meet your every epicurean need and desire during the day.\nOne of the highlights of Harvest Day is the big parade through town.
