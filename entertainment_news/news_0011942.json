The movie is “Woodlawn,” a Christian-theme sports drama based on the true story of black high school football player Tony Nathan integrating Birmingham’s Woodlawn High School in 1973. Nathan later played for the University of Alabama and the Miami Dolphins. “There are two major themes,” Trinity Associate Pastor Roger Barefoot said, “a life-changing experience through Jesus Christ, and racial reconciliation.” Having seen a sneak preview, Barefoot said it’s also a great football movie with well-shot, realistic and dramatic game scenes. “The footage of the football plays is amazing,” Barefoot said. “It’s going to fire up any football player that sees it.” Barefoot calls this adopting the team for a day. Each player who comes will get a ticket to the movie, popcorn and a soda. Afterward at Trinity, there will be a barbecue and barbecue-chicken dinner for the players, and small-group discussion about the movie and what it meant to them. He thinks “Woodlawn” has an important message this year considering the recent series of racially charged shootings. “It just seemed to stir up racial tension, and I think there’s been an attempt to reopen a wound where there’s been a significant amount of healing over the decades,” Barefoot said. He hopes other churches or businesses will sponsor teams in the area to see the movie. He would be willing to help set that up. He has done this before, booking theaters at reduced rates for movies like “God’s Not Dead,”“Do You Believe?” and “War Room.” While he wants to see all local teams go, he especially hopes players from Williams, Cummings and Graham high schools will see “Woodlawn.” “Because of the particular, I guess, mix of races on the teams,” Barefoot said. “Again, it’s so much about the racial reconciliation and the unity.” Any organization wanting Barefoot’s help can contact him at roger@trinityworship.net.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T01:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T14:23:32.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
