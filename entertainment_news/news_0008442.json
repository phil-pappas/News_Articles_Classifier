Jason Chaffetz of Utah, said he was \"absolutely stunned. [I] did not see that coming.\"\nSome lawmakers were even in tears following McCarthy's abrupt announcement, upset that what should have been an orderly transition of power has descended into what many of them called chaos.\nMcCarthy had faced opposition from the same 40 hard-line conservatives who wanted to unseat the current speaker, John Boehner.\nTim Huelskamp of Kansas said McCarthy's exit from the race is a victory for the American people.\n\"They want Congress to respect conservatives and other members of Congress and that hasn't happened very much in the last four and a half years,\" said Huelskamp.\nBut not everyone saw it that way, like New York congressman Peter King.\n\"We can't allow a small minority of 30-35 people to hijack the House of Representatives,\" said King.\nFlorida Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen called it \"a fight for the soul of the GOP.\"\n\"We need somebody who's willing to negotiate and talk to the other side, and those are not bad ways to govern,\" Lehtinen said.\nThree days ago, North Carolina Republican Walter Jones sent a letter to Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers saying if any candidate for speaker has committed any \"misdeeds,\" he should \"withdraw\" from the race.\nMcCarthy denied that this was behind his sudden move. \"No. No. Come on,\" he remarked to reporters.\nThe chaos surrounding the speaker election comes as Congress faces looming deadlines, including the vote to raise the debt ceiling by Nov. 5 and finding a way to fund the government by December.\nBoehner says he will stay on until a new speaker is elected.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T14:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:28:18.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
