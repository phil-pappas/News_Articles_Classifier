(Thames/Syco/Fremantle) \nThe crowd loved the performance, but it all went wrong when the music stopped. “I’ve got something to say. Y’know what? I invite you all to film this, or put up your phones. They ain’t going to throw four or five thousand people out,” Noise said. \nThe X Factor supremo immediately objected: “Mason, just one second. What gives you the right to say that?” Cowell queried. \n“The first audition I watched on Saturday, people had 10 minute slots, and I went to 47 seconds,” the singer replied. \n“Mason, y’know what? You are five seconds away from getting thrown off this stage. And I mean it,” an exasperated Cowell insisted. “You are being a complete a e. Don’t tell me how long you should have on this show. If you’ve got a problem, then just go.” Promoted stories (Thames/Syco/Fremantle) \nBoos erupted around Wembley’s SSE Arena as Noise argued with Cowell. He ordered the R & B singer to apologise, but the young man refused. “Well then, go,” the head judge ordered. Noise dropped the mic and left the stage, still protesting. \nBBC Radio One’s Nick Grimshaw, who is mentoring the Boys, said he would have given Noise a seat. \nIn this controversial stage of boot camp, each judge cuts their category down to six finalists for Judges’ Houses by granting one a seat on stage if they’re considered good enough. (Thames/Syco/Fremantle) \nWhen all six seats are taken if a better choice comes along, a seated contestant can be swapped out of their seat – and possibly out of the ITV competition for good. \nGirls mentor Rita Ora already has her six finalists and now Grimshaw’s line-up is complete. \nOne of the three stand-out Boys on the night was Che Chesterton from Essex. The 19-year-old impressed with James Brown classic It’s A Mans Mans Mans World. (Thames/Syco/Fremantle) \nMechanic Josh Daniel, 21, from County Durham was also given a seat following his emotional rendition of Emeli Sande’s Clown. \nFlamboyant 24-year-old Australian Seann Miley Moore made it through to the Judges’ Houses stage with ease. He sang a Shirley Bassey song in a gold dress and high heels. \nTom Bleasby, a 19-year-old from Leeds, slipped into the next round by the skin of his teeth after being seated, un-seated and then seated again. Completing Nick’s final six are Coventry’s Ben Clark, a 25-year-old-receptionist, and 23-year-old Simon Lynch from the Isle of Man. (Thames/Syco/Fremantle) \nCheryl Fernandez-Versini faces an intriguing problem as she puts her finalists together. Two gospel groups are competing against each other. As if that wasn’t enough, it’s also sibling versus sibling. \nSilvertone’s Rachel McIntosh will go up against her brother Nathan, a member of Bekln, when the Six Chair Challenge concludes with the Groups and Simon Cowell’s Overs next week.
