The pair even appeared on Saturday Night Live together in 2009, and played up to a rumoured rift with a faux catfight. Feud skewed ... Lady Gaga and Madonna mocked their disharmony on Saturday Night Life Source: Supplied \nBut when Gaga released Born This Way in 2011, Madonna noticed that it sounded “very familiar”— and drew comparisons between the song and her own hit single Express Yourself . \nSpeaking to 20/20 on ABC, Madonna said the song “felt reductive”. \n“She references me in a lot of her work and sometimes I think it’s amusing and flattering and well done,” Madonna said. \n“There’s a lot of ways to look at it. I can’t really be annoyed by it because, obviously, I’ve influenced her.” Star rising ... The similarities between Lady Gaga’s songs and her own music angered Madonna. Picture: Jordan Strauss/Invision Source: AP \nIn retaliation, Madonna even performed a mash up of Born This Way and Express Yourself on her MDNA tour. \nGaga, who was famous for keeping quiet about drama, told Howard Stern that Madonna was “more aggravated that I’m not upset that she doesn’t like me”. \n“Because I don’t care that she doesn’t like me — no, I don’t care. There’s always this pissing match, ‘did she take her torch? is she the new her? is she going to outlast her?’ There’s this thing with some people that I’m a threat to the throne. I don’t want your f*cking throne and no thanks. I have my own and I don’t actually want a throne at all.” \nGaga also told Attitude magazine that she had always hoped to “piss Madonna off” with her talent. \n“I’ve basically been hoping that I would become so good that one day I would p*ss off Madonna.” \nIn a candid interview with Rolling Stone, Madonna said she only ever criticised Gaga when she “blatantly ripped off” one of her songs. \n“It’s got nothing to do with ‘she’s taking my crown’ or ‘she’s in some space of mine’— she has her thing. I do think she’s a very talented singer and songwriter. It was just that one issue. And everybody’s obviously run with it and turned it into a huge feud, which I think is really boring, quite frankly. I don’t care anymore.” \nThe two blondes seemingly mended fences this year after the MET ball, taking selfies with Gaga’s other enemy, Katy Perry . \nBritney Spears v Christina Aguilera \nThey started out starring together on the Mickey Mouse Club as kids and both released their hugely popular debut albums in 1999 so it was expected that Aguilera would be compared with and pitted against Spears. Healthy rivalry ... Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera have grown up in the spotlight together. Picture: Suzanne Plunkett Source: News Corp Australia \nThe pair even performed alongside their idol Madonna at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards, shocking the world when the three famously locked lips on stage. \nBut Aguilera later revealed that Spears was “distant” during rehearsals, despite attempts to speak with her. \n“Every time I tried to start a conversation with her — well, let’s just say she seemed nervous the whole time,” Aguilera told Blender magazine. \n“She seems to me like a lost little girl, someone who desperately needs guidance.” \nIn true pop royalty fashion, Spears then did an interview with Blender magazine, and slammed Aguilera for her comments. Controversial kiss ... Britney and Christina made headlines after kissing Madonna at the VMAs Source: Splash News Australia \n“She comes up to me in a club in front of all these people and tries to put her tongue down my throat! I say, ‘It’s good to see you,’ and she goes, ‘Well, you’re not being real with me.’ I was like, ‘Well, Christina, what’s your definition of real? Going up to girls and kissing them after you haven’t seen them for two years?’ \n“A lost girl? I think it’s probably the other way around. I can’t believe she said that about me. When someone has been rude to you so many times, it’s like, ‘You know what, Christina, I’m really not about the fake anymore’.” \nAfter Spears married her back-up dancer beau Kevin Federline in 2004, Aguilera told US Weekly that Britney is not trailer trash “but she sure acts that way”. \n“I can’t believe that girl bought her own engagement ring,” she added. \n“I’ve seen it up close — it looks like she got it on [shopping television network] QVC.” \nThen in 2012 when Aguilera worked with Max Martin, who produced hit records for N’Sync and Britney Spears, she told Billboard magazine that they were the sort of records she “wanted to stay apart from”. Bad blood ... Katy Perry and Taylor Swift used to be friends.

After ... Katy Perry has been in an on-and-off relationship with Mayer ever since Source: Supplied Before ... Taylor Swift briefly dated John Mayer Source: Supplied \nFor the first few years of their careers, they seemed like good friends — tweeting each other and being photographed together at events. \nBut the feud seemed to kick off when Perry started dating musician John Mayer in 2012, mere months after he broke up with Swift. \nFor the uninitiated, Swift didn’t take the break up well and even penned the heartbroken song Dear John in his honour. \nThough according to Swift, it all started when Perry allegedly poached three of her dancers during an arena tour. \nIn true Swift fashion, she wrote a song about the incident called Bad Blood . \n“For years, I was never sure if we were friends or not. She would come up to me at awards shows and say something and walk away, and I would think, ‘Are we friends, or did she just give me the harshest insult of my life? [Then] she did something so horrible, I was like, ‘Oh, we’re just straight-up enemies.’ And it wasn’t even about a guy!” Katy Perry Threatens Taylor Swift in New Interview 1:01 \nKaty Perry finally responds to Taylor Swift's diss in Rolling Stone. Katy chooses Billboard magazine for her rebuttal. January 31st 2015 8 months ago /video/video.news.com.au/Entertainment/Celebrity/ \nPerry took to Twitter to comment on the feud, and even managed to drop a Means Girls reference. Watch out for the Regina George in sheep's clothing... — KATY PERRY (@katyperry) September 9, 2014 \nAfter Swift became embroiled in a debate on Twitter with Nicki Minaj, both Perry and actor Camilla Belle (who Swift previously wrote an offensive song about) weighed in on Swift’s hypocrisy. @katyperry Couldn't have said it better... — Camilla Belle (@CamillaBelle) July 23, 2015 \nMadonna v Elton John \nWhen Madonna recorded the theme song for the 2002 James Bond film Die Another Day, John labelled it “the worst Bond tune ever”. \n“It hasn’t got a tune. James Bond themes are usually very camp and this one’s different,” John told Sky News. \n“I don’t think it’s the best Madonna record and I’m a big fan.” \nThen John took aim at Madonna again at the Q Awards in 2004 , accusing her of lip-synching during her Re-Invention tour. \nWhen he took the stage to accept an award, John said: “Madonna (is the) best live act? F*ck off! Since when has lip-synching been live? I think everyone who lip syncs on stage in public when you pay like 75 quid to see them should be shot.” Best of friends ... Lady Gaga and Elton John are very close friends. Picture: Jason DeCrow Source: News Limited \nAt the Golden Globes in 2012, John’s husband David Furnish said Madonna’s best original song win “ shows how these awards have nothing to do with merit ”. \n“Her acceptance speech was embarrassing in its narcissism,” Furnish said. \nBefore Madonna’s much-anticipated Super Bowl gig in 2012, John offered Madonna some advice: “Make sure you lip-synch good”. \nBut it seems like the pair have buried the hatchet, with John recently announcing they had made up in a restaurant in France . \n“I apologised profusely because what I said should never have appeared in public,” John said. Washed up ... Christina Aguilera’s current career is “talent show host” Source: Splash News Australia \nChristina Aguilera v Lady Gaga \nWhen Gaga was just starting to make a name for herself in 2008, Aguilera was accused of copying her looks. \nGaga even acknowledged that there was an obvious resemblance between their looks “whether she was inspired by my work [or not]”. But an offended Aguilera quickly denied that she had copied Gaga. \n“I’m not quite sure who this person is, to be honest. I don’t know if it is a man or a woman.” Aguilera said. \n“I just wasn’t sure. I really don’t spend any time on the internet, so I guess I live a little under a rock in that respect.” \nIn another interview, Aguilera said the comparisons “come with the territory” and that it was “not even worth wasting the breath to comment on”. \n“I’ve been around for over a decade and I think my work speaks for myself. [When I was younger] I would have engaged, been a little upset [about the comparisons],” she said. \nGossip monger Perez Hilton, who was previously good friends with Gaga during her early days, accused her of previously running a campaign to sabotage the careers of her peers like Aguilera, Katy Perry and Natalie Kills. \nBut that didn’t stop Aguilera and Gaga making amends in 2013 after Gaga asked her to feature on her single Do What U Want , and they performed the track on The Voice . Do What U Want - Lady Gaga and Christina Aguilera \nTalking about Aguilera after their duet, Gaga said she had always been a “very big fan” of Aguilera and she had felt the copying controversy was “very unfair to her”. \n“Christina is an incredible vocalist and an incredible artist, and from me to her I’m so sorry for anything that anyone ever said to her because of my existence, and I hope that she never felt any way about it,” Gaga said. Obsessed ... Mariah Carey has had some words for Madonna over the years. Picture: Peter Kramer Source: AP \nMariah Carey v Madonna \nBack before the baby popstars first entered the scene, there was one young diva making her way on the scene in 1995. \nHer name was Mariah Carey and she immediately got Madonna off-side. \nMadonna was once quoted as saying Carey was “not particularly bright” and that she would rather kill herself than be her. \nCarey bit back and told an interviewer that she hadn’t paid attention to Madonna since 7th or 8th grade . \n“... when she used to be popular,” Carey said, with a laugh. \nIn an obvious dig at Madonna in another interview, Carey said she doesn’t like it when Americans move to England and suddenly develop an accent. \n“Sorry I can’t help jumping into the little joke English accent, have a laugh, but when I do it I know I’m joking, clearly I’m from New York. It’s not like let me coming here and pretending I’ve got an English accent cause I want to pretend to be fabulous.” \nThen this year, Carey’s new billionaire beau James Packer spoke about music legends with impressive vocals. \n“Who else is there? There is Barbra Streisand, Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey. Not Madonna — those [other] three can sing five octaves.” \nOther great sledges: \n* In an interview with Spin magazine in 1996, Madonna said drugs had “destroyed [Courtney Love’s] brain, or are slowly destroying her”. Madonna added that she is fascinated by Love in the same way she is “by somebody who’s got Tourette’s syndrome walking in Central Park. She fascinates me on that level ... I feel sorry for her” \n* When asked about the similarities between Madonna’s music and her own, Janet Jackson said the only similarity is that they're dance music. “How do I put this? I think what I do has class to it,” she said. \n* When asked about Mariah Carey on Sunrise, Katy Perry said “she’s fabulous — for a throwback.” \n* While talking about Gaga, MIA said her music is not “reflective of how weird she wants to be or thinks she is”. “She models herself on Grace Jones and Madonna, but the music sounds like 20-year-old Ibiza music, you know?” \n* And you could be forgiven for not remembering who exactly Ciara is, considering none of her five albums have managed to rate higher than #35 on the ARIA charts. But that didn’t stop the Queen of Shade, Rihanna, from being offended by Ciara telling the hosts of Fashion Police about her alleged attitude problem.
