The pair will show the movie Saturday night at Palace Theater as part of the 2015 Syracuse International Film Festival.\n\"I've had this marked on the calendar for a long time,\" Crimmins, who now lives in the Southern Tier, said in a phone interview.\nBarry Crimmins performs standup comedy in a vintage clip featured in the documentary \"Call Me Lucky.\" Video still \"Call Me Lucky\" starts out as a funny look at Crimmins' career as a stand-up comedian and political satirist, telling angry jokes on stage with a beer and cigarette in his hand. Comedians like David Cross, Patton Oswalt, Margaret Cho, Billy Bragg, Marc Maron, Tom Kenny , Goldthwait and others talk about his influence and his sharp, angry wit.\nThen the film takes a serious shift as it follows a big change: Crimmins' realization that he had repressed memories of being sexually abused as a 4-year-old child in North Syracuse.\n\"I remember him touching my curly hair,\" an emotional Crimmins recalls in the documentary. \"This guy would come over, he would take me down in the basement and rape me.\"\nAt one point, a camera follows Crimmins into the basement where the father of his then babysitter molested him. He said it was important no one thinks of it as a \"this place of evil.\"\n\"[Bobcat] didn't want to make me go in the basement -- he couldn't have made me,\" Crimmins said. \"[But] it's been so many years, I wasn't going to walk away from it... It was hard going in there, but it would've been a lot worse for me not to.\"\nCrimmins told The Post-Standard in 2005 he thought his comedy was a defense mechanism for dealing with the traumatic experience. The abuser died years ago without ever facing criminal charges, but he said he was no longer angry about it.\nIn fact, Crimmins now considers himself a fortunate survivor as he later found the courage to help other child abuse victims. The film shows footage of Crimmins testifying to Congress in the mid-'90s about child porn he saw being shared in AOL chat rooms, including evidence he collected while posing as a young child.\n\"People say 'wow it took a lot of courage'... it would've taken a lot more courage for me to not do something about it,\" Crimmins said. \"I couldn't live with myself had I not done something.\"\nCrimmins says Goldthwait originally wanted to do a movie about Crimmins' battle with AOL and child pornographers in the early days of the Internet, but friend and fellow comic Robin Williams suggested making it a documentary. (During the credits for \"Call Me Lucky,\" a brief scene with a famous actor telling classic Crimmins jokes hints at what a dramatic film would've looked like.)\nDoing it as a documentary also enabled Crimmins and Goldthwait to reminisce on how they met in the late '70s when Crimmins hosted comedy nights at the Old Stone Mill in Skaneateles. Goldthwait and Kenny, then students at Bishop Grimes High School, responded to a newspaper ad showing \"Bearcat\" Crimmins seeking local comics and started calling themselves \"Bobcat\" and \"Tomcat\" in tribute.\n\"They were mocking me,\" Crimmins says with a laugh. He never personally called himself \"Bearcat,\" though the nickname \"Bobcat\" stuck with Goldthwait through his career as a standup comedian and \"Police Academy\" cop with a gruff, high-pitched voice.\nComedian and author Barry Crimmins, a former Skaneateles resident, is pictured in 2008 in front of the Old Stone Mill, where he ran a comedy club in the 1970s. Gloria Wright | The Post-Standard Crimmins still does standup comedy -- in fact, he'll perform at ArtRage in Syracuse on Friday at 7 p.m. -- and he still talks politics, though don't expect him to make Donald Trump jokes.\n\"I like broader things to talk about than just the electoral process,\" he explains.\nHoping many come out to @ArtRageGallery tmrw night to disprove the adage that the 3 toughest places to play are 3-LA 2-NYC 1-Your Hometown\n— Barry Crimmins (@crimmins) October 15, 2015 He's also very open with his dislike of the Catholic Church. In a Reddit AMA this week, he said Pope Francis is \"much better than the last guy at obfuscating the problem the church doesn't want us to talk about - the centuries old child abuse scandal.\"\n\"I tweet the pope every day to demand an excommunication,\" he says in the film. \"You know, you got to have a hobby.\"\n\"Call Me Lucky,\" now available on DVD and Blu-ray, will be shown at 9:30 p.m. Saturday at the Palace Theater, with a Q&A by Crimmins and Goldthwait. Goldthwait will also show his 2011 film, \"God Bless America,\" at midnight. Tickets are $10 for general admission and $8 for seniors and students to each screening; an \"all night Bobcat special\" pass for both films costs $18.\nFor more information on the Syracuse International Film Festival, visit www.filminsyracuse.com .\nPlease excommunicate me.
