(Photo by Wade Payne/Invision/AP) \nNASHVILLE, Tenn. – Christian rapper Lecrae was named artist of the year at the 46th annual Dove Awards on Tuesday night for bringing new fans to the genre, while also breaking the mould for gospel artists. \nThe Grammy-winning artist made history last year when his seventh album, “Anomaly,” became the first title to top Billboard’s Top 200 and Gospel Albums charts in the same week. He also won awards for rap/hip hop album of the year and rap/hip hop song of the year. \nNewcomer Lauren Daigle also took home three awards, including new artist, song of the year and pop/contemporary song of the year for her anthem single, “How Can It Be,” which she also performed during the show, held at Lipscomb University in Nashville, Tennessee.
