Examples included:\n• Five WMBE subcontractors, who initially were reported on the first WMBE list that Mr. Huttinga complied as receiving contracts totalling $772,259, were nowhere to be found on Mr. Huttinga’s second list. Among them was Champion Fire Protection, which, as it turns out, is not owned by women or minorities.\n• Ten WMBE firms originally listed as receiving $9.6 million in contract awards were down to $7.5 million on the second list, marking an initial overstatement of $2.1 million.\n• The originally listed contract awards to Willie J. Harswell and W & W Custom Cabinets were double what they should have been, and the originally reported contract award to William Henry Trucking was quadrupled.\nThe first question school board members, including capital improvement committee chairman Shawn Kachmar, should ask Mr. Huttinga is what Chatham County taxpayers are getting from the Parsons Team for the public’s money.\nThe school district is paying Parsons, a California-based construction management company and its two local partners, Thomas & Hutton and Vanguard, $6.5 million to monitor and manage portions of the ESPLOST II building projects. Vanguard is a partnership made up of Savannah businessman Sylvester Formey and Savannah City Alderwoman Estella Shabazz. Parsons team members rate and recommend all companies that seek new construction contracts — about $327 million worth of work. The team reports directly to Superintendent Thomas Lockamy and replaces the district’s facilities management staff, which formerly bird-dogged the school construction contracts. Dr. Lockamy and Mr. Kachmar, whose capital improvement committee serves on the frontline in determining where millions of public dollars are spent, must insist on accurate WMBE numbers. Otherwise, it’s impossible to accurately determine whether this program is achieving its noble goals of creating more local jobs and opportunities and whether it must be reformed, as some business owners and elected school board members believe.\nSo what is the problem in getting accurate data? Mr. Huttinga suggests that it’s laziness on the part of companies that manage the school construction projects — known as construction managers at risk. These managers are required to regularly update their WMBE reports with the Parsons Team and verify their numbers with the team and “provide us with what they see as their final numbers,” Mr. Huttinga said. Those aren’t unrealistic expectations. But Mr. Huttinga suggested that some managers are sloppily or lazy, not checking their own numbers before turning them in. There should be some kind of penalty for such shoddy reporting. If a company can’t be trusted to shoot straight on how they’re spending the public’s money, maybe they don’t deserve a piece of the public’s pie.\nBut if part of the Parsons Team’s job is to rate and recommend companies for school work, how did Champion Fire Protection get past their eagle eyes? Checking out the gender or races of a company’s owners isn’t rocket science. But not all of the discrepancies were clerical errors. In fact, Mr. Huttinga said, other discrepancies were caused by last-minute contract changes. Mr. Huttinga downplayed the discrepancies, calling them minimal when you look at the big picture. ESPLOST II construction contracts worth $90 million have been awarded, he said, and the discrepancies in WMBE reporting only amount to about $3 million. Maybe so. But $3 million amounts to a lot of paychecks and jobs for smaller companies, and they’re still the public’s dollars, not the Parsons Team’s dollars.\n“Sometimes subcontractors do more and sometimes they do less than expected,” he said. “One subcontractor might get replaced with another subcontractor when it comes time to do the job, and that is another reason for the change. … Work scopes change and new names drop on and off the list as a result, or the agreements the subcontractors have can change if the vendor or subcontractor can’t perform the work.”\nThat’s understandable. But that’s even more reason to keep accurate statistics. Otherwise, costs can quickly inflate, creating doubts in the public’s mind about whether their tax dollars are properly spent.\n“Parsons is being paid $6.5 million,” Superintendent Thomas Lockamy said in September 2013. “Let them earn it.” He was right then. And he’s more than right now. And if they haven’t earned it, then the Parsons Team should face some consequences.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-19T17:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:04:16.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
