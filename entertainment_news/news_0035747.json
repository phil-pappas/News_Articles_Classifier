New to DVD: Week of Oct. 20 \nIf you believe the movie — and by all accounts the film nails the tech titan’s deeply flawed character, if not all of the historic record of his life — Jobs was a visionary in the tech world but a horrible human being. \nJobs treated just about everyone he encountered — friends, work colleagues, romantic partners and even his own daughter — shabbily, as they were irksome creatures to be barely tolerated and most assuredly could not understand his vision of the future. \nThink about it. If this guy could rationalize treating his own daughter like an interchangeable part, how would Jobs handle a bunch of people in China putting together the iPhone? \nNo wonder the iPhone plant had to put up nets around the building to prevent its workers from jumping off the roof. \nStudents of history shouldn’t be surprised by that revelation, though. Other epoch-changing business titans were as flawed as Jobs. \nHenry Ford was a virulent anti-Semite. William Randolph Hearst used his mammoth newspaper holdings as a personal piggy bank. And Andrew Carnegie had the blood of the Homestead Strikers on his hands, even as he gave away his vast fortune for admirable public projects. New to streaming: Week of Oct. 20 \nBoyle and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (“The West Wing” and “The Social Network”) construct “Steve Jobs” as a sort of trial. The first half of the film is a prosecutorial brief laying out all of Jobs’ character flaws. The second act of the film is his defense. Boyle and Sorkin leave it up to the audience to deliver their own verdict. \nThe film’s story is built around the launching of three different major tech products: The Macintosh, the NEXT computer and the iMac over a 15-year period. At each product launch a series of characters — akin to the ghosts who visit Scrooge in “A Christmas Carol” — come to cajole, lecture and prod the executive. \nMost prominently, there’s Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen), Jobs’ lifelong friend and co-founder of Apple, John Sculley (Jeff Daniels), his father figure and eventual mortal enemy and Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet), his conscience and den mother, of sorts. \nMichael Fassbender, left, as Steve Jobs and Makenzie Moss as a young Lisa Jobs, appear in a scene from the film “Steve Jobs.” (Photo: Universal Pictures) \nBoyle weaves all these characters together brilliantly as they spout Sorkin’s rapid-fire and razor-sharp dialogue. All the actors have their moments to shine as they deliver Sorkin’s brilliant screenplay, which throws verbal darts at the Apple CEO, who mostly deftly deflects criticism with charisma, showmanship and brilliance. \nAt the center of the movie is a towering performance by Fassbender, who makes Jobs alternately fascinating, repulsive and inspirational depending on his character’s mood. Spielberg, Hanks cross 'Bridge of Spies' in high style \nWatching Fassbender’s performance, you understand why so many people put up with Jobs. He was a world-class jerk, yes, but Jobs also held out the promise to be part of something that transforms the world. \nWhat “Steve Jobs” compels you to do is take pause and ask this important question: In this new world of information at your fingertips and the ability to connect with anyone in the world in an instant, is it equally important to be a decent human being? \n★★★★ \nNow playing: Tulare Galaxy 10; Visalia Stadium 10 \nMPAA rating : R for language \nFilm facts: Stars Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen and Jeff Daniels. Directed by Danny Boyle. 122 minutes. \nBOTTOM LINE : Director Danny Boyle and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin do a brilliant job painting an impressionistic portrait of the late Apple co-founder and tech guru Steve Jobs. The performances, especially by Michael Fassbender, are brilliant. 7 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://vtd-tar.co/1RWticA MORE STORIES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T09:33:00.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
