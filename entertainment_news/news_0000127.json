KALAMAZOO, MI, October 01, 2015 /24-7PressRelease/ -- For their second symphonic series concert, the Kalamazoo Symphony Orchestra presents Mozart and Haydn. Guest conductor, Edwin Outwater makes his KSO debut leading a diverse program of contemporary and classical highlights.\nThe concert opens with Nico Muhly's So Far So Good. One of today's most celebrated young composers, Nico Muhly (b. 1981) is a composer of chamber music, orchestral music, sacred music, opera, ballet, and music for collaborators across a variety of fields. So Far So Good alludes to the classical ideals of Mozart and Haydn while exploring contemporary musical language.\nJames Austin Smith, also making his KSO debut, will play Mozart's famous Concerto for Oboe in C Major followed by Pedrollo's lesser known but charming Concertino for Oboe.\nHaydn's Symphony No. 102 in B-flat Major rounds out the program. Completed in 1794, this symphony contains Haydn's characteristic wit and humor along with episodes of poignant, dream-like music. At the premiere, a chandelier fell from the ceiling. Miraculously, the audience escaped unharmed because they had rushed the stage. Because of this incident, Haydn's Symphony No. 102, is often referred to as \"The Miracle.\"\nABOUT THE ARTISTS\nEdwin Outwater\nEdwin Outwater is Music Director of Ontario's Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony (KWS), Director of Summer Concerts at the San Francisco Symphony (SFS), and a regular guest conductor of the Chicago, San Francisco and New World Symphonies. Equally adept at interpreting canonical masterworks, premiering new commissions, and creating outside-the-box audience-building initiatives the American conductor is, as San Francisco Classical Voice recently observed, \"headed for a top-tier future.\"\nIn the 2014-15 season, his eighth as Music Director of the KWS, Outwater led the orchestra in a characteristically diverse array of programs. These included \"The Mozart Phenomenon\"; a program focusing on Stravinsky and another of works inspired by Shakespeare; and works by contemporary Canadian composers. He also continues the orchestra's groundbreaking \"Intersections\" series of cross-cultural and interdisciplinary collaborations. In 2011, Outwater directed the KWS in its first commercial CD release in over a decade, From Here On Out on Analekta, with music by Nico Muhly, Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood, and Arcade Fire's Richard Reed Parry, the last piece a KWS commission. This past summer, in his inaugural season as Director of Summer Concerts at the SFS, Outwater directed jazz-inflected works by Bernstein, Gershwin, and Ravel; an all-Beethoven program; and collaborations with pianist Makoto Ozone and Broadway star Cheyenne Jackson, among others.\nA native of Santa Monica, California, Edwin Outwater attended Harvard University, graduating with a degree in English; he received his master's degree in conducting from UC Santa Barbara. Outwater was Resident Conductor of the San Francisco Symphony from 2001-2006 where he worked closely with Michael Tilson Thomas.
