Photo: Pat Scala \n​Swan Street, Richmond, early Spring: the sun is out and the air is perfumed with souvlaki grease and coffee grounds.\nNick Gadd, author and psychogeographer, is showing me a ghost sign on the facade of a tall Victorian building. The faded type on the parapet reads: The Australian Mont De Piete Loans & Deposits. Along the side of the building more type can be detected beneath layers of graffiti. While shoppers amble by, we squint, trying to decipher missing letters – it's like playing street hangman. \nGadd was born in Yorkshire but has lived in Melbourne for 20 years. For the past 18 months he has been walking a slow circle of the inner city, finding ghost signs and lost histories and writing about them on his blog, Melbourne Circle.\nWhen he first conceived of the project he thought it would take a year, but he still has kilometres to go. His wanderings have led him to a former explosives site in Avondale Heights, a forgotten modernist factory in Maidstone and the bluestone stock routes of Kensington's sale-yards. He will end where he started in Williamstown South, by ferry.\nAdvertisement The term psychogeography was coined by the Marxist theorist Guy Debord​ in 1955 to describe the effect of a geographical location on the emotions and behaviour of individuals.\nThe Situationists undertook \"derives\" (drifts) through urban environments as a \"mode of experimental behaviour\". The practice has gained popularity through the work of writers such as Will Self and Iain Sinclair. Gadd credits Melbourne writer and academic Tony Birch with introducing him to the subject and defines it as \"an attempt to understand a place by experiencing it at close range, and seeking to make a connection with the lives and the stories embedded in the place\".\n \"It's about curiosity,\" he says. \"It's about finding particular things in the landscape, and then they trigger the imagination. I'm a creative writer, not a historian.\"\nMy fantasies of secret handshakes among furtive searchers of street quiddities are a little misplaced.\n\"Anyone can do this.\" It's an undertaking that requires little more than curiosity and sensible footwear.\"\nWhen investigating ghost signs, Gadd looks to clues from the surrounding buildings. He might refer to Sands and McDougall, the annual Melbourne street directories that were discontinued in the 1970s, or Trove, the National Library's archives. Or he'll pitch it to his network of ghost sign enthusiasts.\n\"I'll tweet a photo. More often than not someone knows something.\" \nAs we head south past East Richmond station, Gadd notes some occupational hazards. One can arouse suspicion: \"Occasionally, people don't like it when they see you walking past their house with a camera.\" \nOnce, with his partner, Lynne, he was taking photos of old carnival equipment in an otherwise empty yard \"…and this bloke emerged from somewhere and says 'What are you doing?' We didn't want to say anything with the word 'psycho' in it – so we told him it was a history project. The bloke said, 'What f---in' history? There's no f---in' history here except for people getting stabbed!'\n\"We told him about the peanut butter factory down the road, and then he got interested and started recounting his own memories.\"\nOn Church Street, two women ask us for directions. (\"I often get asked for directions. I must look like I know where I'm going,\" says Gadd.) We send them to the Queen Victoria Market and I think about how it was built on top of the old Melbourne cemetery, a fact often overlooked in the tourism brochures. \nWe enter the site of the former Bryant and May Industrial complex. The match-making factory was established in 1909. We stare up at the clocktower.\n\"That's a statement: whoever made this knew it was going to be here for a long time,\" Gadd muses.\nThe typographic clock (letters for numbers) was replicated by Dimmey's Department Store (Richmond institution, much missed) in the 1960s.\nBryant and May were equable employers. Their staff enjoyed a dining hall and sports facilities, including tennis courts and a bowling green. Walking around the site, the air feels serene. It could be the silence after the bustle of Church Street, or it could be the sunshine, but I like to think it's something of the spirit of the past. \nGadd and I talk about the recycling of institutions into residential apartments, about the psychic weight a building might hold in its bones. The social history of Melbourne can be found in its streets and architecture. In the outer suburbs, the feeling can be one of emptiness and shadows, the sense that you could walk for hours and never actually get anywhere.\n\"It's remarkable how different one suburb feels to another. In Essendon they made a conscious decision that they didn't want any factories.\n\"You walk around and there's little trace of industrial history. Instead there's lots of evidence of wealth, mansions built by wealthy pastoralists or businessmen in the 1880s or earlier, some of whom ended up losing the lot in the economic crash around the 1890s ... you can imagine loss and struggle there but of a different kind.\"\nFrom the calm of Bryant and May, we walk under the railway bridge to the former Rosella factory. The signage is peeling, pastel blue.\nIt memory-flashes me to backyard barbecues and sausages in squashy white bread. You can think you know a place and really know nothing about it at all.\nWe are in Cremorne, a corner of East Richmond bordered by the Yarra and Hoddle, Church and Swan streets. In 1853, Cremorne was a pleasure garden – maze, fireworks, lagoon, menagerie.\nThis arcadia was later adapted into a lunatic asylum, and then later still redeployed as residential apartments. It's home to perfectly sane young families and several heritage-listed neon \"skysigns\". \"Another way to read the city – I learned about this from Stephen Banham, an expert on neon signage.\" \nGadd shows me the sign for Slades Knitwear factory – cursive script, vintage cool –  then we're craning for a glimpse of the Nylex sign.\nThe Nylex clock has associations outside its original purpose of spruiking plastics and letting you know how long you've been sitting in Punt Road traffic. Paul Kelly famously used it as his stage in his video for Leaps and Bounds .\nThe sign has been non-operational for years now. Earlier this year an anonymous group calling themselves the Nylon Clock Collective secretly switched the lights back on, but it was just a fleeting illumination.\n\"Making connections is the other thing I really like,\" Gadd says.\n\"One of the first ghost signs I saw was  for Velvet Soap. In Kensington, there are two ghost signs next to each other for Velvet Soap and Electrine Candles. I looked into that and found out they were both made by the same company, J. Kitchen & Sons, who had a factory in Footscray.\n\"Soap and candles are both made from tallow (animal fat). And where do you get tallow? From animal carcasses. In the 19th century the abattoirs used to sell the bones to companies like Kitchens, who boiled them down for tallow.\n\"For a time in Melbourne' s history, everything was connected to the stock industry. I'd never have known that if I hadn't started with the sign.\"\nOur walk ends with a mystery: high on a wall in Cubitt Street is a ghost sign for Champion Footwear Components – a man in a footy jumper having a kick. The illustration is old-fashioned and ill-proportioned – his leg looks like a ham-hock, his head, a pin.\n\"I've been trying to find out the name of the player. He must have been someone. Someone must know.\"\nmelbournecircle.net", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:30:34.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
