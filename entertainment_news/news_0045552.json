What about a real black President who can properly address the racial divide? And much else.\"\nWhat would make Carson a \"real black President\" in Murdoch's estimation probably has nothing to do with President Barack Obama being biracial, or with both of Carson's parents being African-American.\nFor Murdoch, this is purely about Carson's views and values, which aren't just ultraconservative, like Murdoch's, but downright wacky, like Murdoch's.\nLast month, when Carson said he doesn't believe a Muslim should be president, most thinking people found his comments objectionable and more evidence that he can't possibly be viewed as a serious presidential candidate.\nBut perhaps not Murdoch, whose tweet earlier this year suggests he shares a similar prejudice against Muslims: \"Maybe most Moslems peaceful, but until they recognize and destroy their growing jihadist cancer they must be held responsible.\" (What? As if all Catholics should be held accountable for the sins of the Catholic church.)\nRupert Murdoch tweets Obama isn't 'real black president' Associated Press The founder of the global News Corp. media empire, Rupert Murdoch, is suggesting that President Obama isn't a \"real black president.\"\nMurdoch was praising Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson and his wife on Twitter on Wednesday evening when Quote: : \"Ben and Candy Carson terrific. What...\nThe founder of the global News Corp. media empire, Rupert Murdoch, is suggesting that President Obama isn't a \"real black president.\"\nMurdoch was praising Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson and his wife on Twitter on Wednesday evening when Quote: : \"Ben and Candy Carson terrific. What...\n(Associated Press) That Murdoch believes Carson can be a \"real black president\" is not surprising. The conservative idea of diversity tends not to be about diversity of thought. So, you can be a person of color (Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas), or even a woman (presidential candidate Carly Fiorina), as long as you toe the ideological line.\nAnd that Murdoch believes Carson \"can properly address the racial divide,\" well, that's not surprising either.\nMy conservative readers are constantly recommending that I immerse myself in the writings of black conservatives. If only I had a dollar for the number of times I've heard this, or received interest based on how much these readers truly believe that conservative musings coming from blacks somehow would make them more palatable to me.\nThey're not. Who was it that said, \"Different bottle, same whine?\"\n(News flash, people: Conservatives do not corner the market on the vaunted principles of personal responsibility or rugged individualism, or the need for a more fiscally responsible and agile government.)\nFolks like Murdoch love African-Americans like Carson because, as I've written before, Carson has a great bootstrap story. He grew up in a Detroit ghetto with a single mom and would go on to become a Yale-educated neurosurgeon. Folks, Carson included, make the mistake of believing that he had some formula, some secret sauce for achievement, when the reality is that for every kid like him who climbs out of poverty, so many others fall by the wayside.\nMurdoch continues to view Carson as a shining example, and it doesn't matter that the candidate has said things that have made even some conservatives cringe.\nCarson has talked about abortion being the no. 1 killer of African-Americans; Obamacare being the worst thing that's befallen blacks since slavery; homosexuality being \"absolutely\" a choice because, as he explained, people \"go into prison straight.\" He later apologized for the last one.\nCarson's latest backpedaling came in response to a comment he made about last week's shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon. He said he wouldn't have cooperated with the gunman and he would have done more to stop his killing spree.\n\"I would not just stand there and let him shoot me,\" Carson said on Fox News. \"I would say, 'Hey guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me, but he can't get us all.'\"\nThis sounds like misguided armchair quarterbacking from an eccentric uncle, not someone with presidential aspirations.\nDespite this, Murdoch continues to be a fan.\nLast month, he tweeted: \"Ben Carson polls improving every week. Maybe the one to beat. Irreproachable on background, achievements, character, vision.\"\nLast week, Murdoch tweeted: \"Reputable IBD poll surprises with Carson at 24 and Trump at 17. Allowing fullest possible margin of error, they would be even.\"\nAnd there was this one from last week: \"Everywhere pundits keep underestimating Ben Carson. But public understand humility as admirable, listen to the multi-faceted strong message.\"\nYup, Murdoch has lots of Carson love. But what's telling is what conservatives and others don't say about why they like Carson. He's appealing because he's nonthreatening. He speaks softly, sometimes in a near-whisper. And he's proselytizing their message. For them, this is what mutes his color. And they feel good about themselves and their color-blindness.\nIf this is what's required for a postracial America, I'd humbly tweet: No thank you.\ndmturner@tribpub.com\n Rupert Murdoch Ben Carson Opinion Clarence Thomas Commentary", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5616addd/turbine/ct-rupert-murdoch-ben-carson-dawn-turner-20151008", "http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/ben-carson/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5615fd9a/turbine/la-rupert-murdoch-obama-20151007", "https://twitter.com/rupertmurdoch/status/651924724960874497"], "published": "2015-10-08T22:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:47:48.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
