Monday’s session will be held from noon to 4 p.m.; the Tuesday through Friday sessions will run from 2 to 6 p.m.; and Saturday’s from noon to 3 p.m. in the museum’s Gamble Education Center, on the corner of Grace and Union streets. \nAll ages are invited to learn the process of creating, designing and building a personal mask. Participants will be expected to use their wildest ideas about creatures and myths when designing their work. Puppets will be executed sculpting clay, paper-mache and wire, in addition to adding hand-sewn costumes to create creatures both magical and scary. \nThere also will also be an ongoing, group project of building a large parading puppet. These will be part of the Fall Family Festival Parade, which will depart from the Farnsworth’s Gamble Education Center Saturday, Oct. 17, at 5:30 p.m. \nWhile the mask & puppet-making studio times are flexible, participants should be willing to commit to multiple visits in order to complete a personal mask and allowing drying time in between sessions. Participants should be old enough to work independently, or have adult supervision. The workshop also is open to adults without accompanying children. \nAlthough drop-ins are welcome, advance reservations are greatly appreciated; email the Farnsworth’s Education Department at kfinlay@farnsworthmuseum.org. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
