Dr. Fred Baker runs out of antibiotics and he phones an old friend in Minneapolis to plead for help. But pneumonia had plagued the big city, and antibiotics and help are in short supply.\nAlready dead on his feet from a hard day at the mill, Jim Borden agrees to make the trip to Minneapolis to retrieve the medicine. He borrows a little Chevy coupe and drives through freezing rain to reach the hospital. During the exhausting trip, the car becomes stranded at the bottom of a steep hill. Tired and exhausted, Jim closes his eyes. When he opens his eyes, he sees the blurred team of horses being hooked to the coupe. Jim puts the car in low gear and lets out the clutch. The back tires grip; the car climbs the hill, and the spectral team vanishes into the ice and snow.\nA harsh blizzard drops several feet of snow over the small town of Black Eye, and the town gets totally cut off from the outside world. Travel becomes impossible. Power line are down. The town’s only gas pump is dry, and the shelves in the one little store are bare. Several families gather under one roof to survive the bitter cold. Families begin to barter for food, and even an armful of firewood is traded for a morsel of food. What transpires can only be described as the amazing power of people working together for the same common goal.\nReaders who wish to experience this inspiring work can purchase “Black Eye: A Battle to Survive” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708.\nAbout Page Publishing\nPage Publishing is a traditional New York based full-service publishing house that handles all of the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
