It’s not just a festival celebrating a fish. The festival, in its 61st year, is about community. “Even when I wasn’t living here I came back for the Mullet Festival every year,” deBeaumont said. Although the festival was full of people, it didn’t seem as crowded as usual, she said. “But the food is good, there’s a lot of good vendors and the music is good.” Her favorite thing about the Mullet Festival is running into old friends, she said. Friendship is the reason Mandy Johnson, Fredda Willis, Angie Shore, Elaine Reece and Pam Williams got together at the festival. The group was celebrating a birthday, a friend who is gone and being together, Willis said. “I’m having the time of my life,” she said. They also planned to see Jim Quick & Coastline play at the Pavilion, Willis said as the group went back to dancing. Ken Knox & Co. and The Tams were also scheduled to play. In addition to live music, there was plenty of funnel cake, ice cream, cotton candy and fish to go around. An area was dedicated to children’s activities and crafts, and there were several free wine tastings available. Sherrie Stoll, with Personal Touch Groom & Board in Hubert, said that they had a lot of activity at their booth. This is the fourth Mullet Festival she’s been a vendor at and Stoll and her team, and several family members, enjoy it. “Every year it grows better and better,” she said. The Mullet Festival continues Sunday from 11 a.m. until 5 p.m. For more information, visit swansborofestivals.com .
