The network did say it would air specials to keep fans up to date with the family's progress; the first of these, Jill & Jessa: Counting On , will premiere in December . (It's been widely reported that TLC sees Jill and Jessa, as well as their respective husbands Derick and Ben, as their new reality TV money makers.)\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below A new teaser for the three-part special starts with Jessa and Jill discussing their brother's other big scandal — that he'd developed an addiction to pornography, kept accounts on Ashley Madison and OkCupid, and cheated on his wife Anna. \"We were devastated,\" Jessa says, adding that \"you have to wonder how did this happen?\" Presumably she means that question rhetorically, but a lot of people out there sure have answers! (Like that Quiverfull teachings on sexual conduct are messy and dangerous, for example.) Jill says she was \"angry and hurt,\" and still is; she's \"cried a lot of tears,\" she continues, and still is. She really is, because she's tearing up as she says that.\nMore From Cosmopolitan\nBut they're moving on, the teaser notes, and focuses on Jessa's pregnancy, her first with husband Ben Seewald. \"There are a lot of exciting milestones ahead,\" Jessa says, while Jill is \"excited for what the future holds.\" TLC notes this refers to the missionary trip to Central America she her husband Derick Dillard have taken with their son Israel, but then they're currently offering refunds on donations made to their cause after donors reportedly became concerned their monies were being used frivolously (for travel expenses, as Jill and Derick flew back and forth multiple times between the U.S. and El Salvador for Duggar family get-togethers and weddings over the summer, for example) rather than for proselytizing. That'll be another tabloid mess in the making, then.\nFollow Alex on Twitter . ​", "external_links": ["http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3276753/Jill-Derick-Dillard-offer-refunds-online-donations-questions-arise-missionary-work-Central-America.html", "http://twitter.com/maybealexislost", "http://www.tlc.com/embed?page=163425", "http://www.tlc.com/tlcme/welcome-back-jill-jessa/"], "published": "2015-10-19T20:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:06:49.970+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
