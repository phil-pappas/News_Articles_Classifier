The ceremony, which is due to take place on February 28th of next year, has slowly fallen in ratings.\nLast year's broadcast fell 16% on the previous year's ratings, with many citing the stodgy atmosphere and Neil Patrick Harris' comedy falling flat with audiences and online.\nRock, on the other hand, is considered to be a solid choice. His stint during 2005's ceremony was generally well-received, especially considering Rock threw various amounts of abuse at Hollywood, the industry and Jude Law in particular.\nSo, thoughts? The Oscars needs something to combat the decline, especially since more people are watching and enjoying the Golden Globes instead. Rock is always a great presence and he knows how to work a room, so yes, he'd be a good choice to host.\nHe's done it before, sure, and he can get in a few barbs when he wants to. You could also give it to Louis CK? I don't think any of us would mind seeing Louis take a shot at hosting the Oscars.\nWhat do you think?
