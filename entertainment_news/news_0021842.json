We're backstage at San Francisco's Davies Symphony Hall. The usual suspects, including a figure of conscience, Mac collaborator Andy Hertzfeld (Michael Stuhlbarg), return for a final reckoning, to discuss finances, betrayals, grudges and Jobs' failings of character. The guru at the shiny center of \"Steve Jobs\" has one way of dealing with any threat to his loss of control over any situation: He wires money at the problem, before shutting down emotionally. \nBut daughter Lisa (Perla Haney-Jardine plays the 19-year-old edition) calls him on his issues, at long last. This is just after Daniels' Sculley returns to discuss the Freudian implications of Jobs' own adoptive childhood. Chagrined yet godlike, Jobs is sent off by director Boyle into a bath of glorious white light, to a promised land of iMacs, iPods, iPhones and the rest, shining like the spotless glass windows of an Apple store just before opening.

Jobs' accomplishments are fantastic, of course, and omnipresent, and they did change the world. But having seen \"Steve Jobs\" twice now, I'd like to ask Sorkin what he really thinks of the man. Sorkin's equally ambitious but far wittier script for \"The Social Network\" was infinitely tougher on its subject, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. I'm not sure that's why that film ended up stronger and more clear-eyed than \"Steve Jobs,\" but with this one — which cares no more for biographical facts than \"The Social Network\"— Sorkin's exchanges often go nowhere, floridly. \nFans of the whole truth and nothing but the truth (count me out) will freak out about the biopic liberties taken. I didn't care about that part, at least until the final scene, in which Jobs and his Harvard daughter reconcile over dad's promise to invent the iPod someday soon. At the time Jobs was married with three more children, and Lisa had lived with her dad for several of her teen years. Whatever; Sorkin owes no one the facts, simply his own idea of what makes a compelling fictionalized version of Steve Jobs. \nThe dialogue has a theatrical zing, at its best; at its weakest, the thesis lines regarding Jobs' need for \"end-to-end control\" in every aspect of his life, and his product line, get a little thick. \"Go make a dent in the universe, Steven,\" whispers Winslet at one point. Jobs did, but lines like that don't help anybody's cause. The movie, a formidable technical and design achievement, has everything going for it except a sense of Jobs' inner life. On the other hand, with a charismatic actor on the order of Fassbender staring off into the middle distance in between hissy fits, communing with the gods of tech and commerce, the whirligig of an outer life may be enough. \nPhillips is a Tribune critic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T17:39:00.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
