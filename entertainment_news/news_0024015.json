Fox was torn over Cubs winning World Series prediction in 'Back to the Future II\" By JOHN CARUCCI AP Entertainment Writer   22, 2015 - 12:58 amLast Updated: October 22, 2015 - 12:58 am   \nPeople: Photo Gallery: \nClick to view (6 Photos) \nNEW YORK â€” While some of the predictions made in \"Back to the Future II\" eventually came true like, Skype and fingerprint scanners, one of them did not: The Chicago Cubs winning the World Series. \nAt a special screening for the film Wednesday, star Michael J. Fox admitted on the red carpet that he was a little torn over that one. \n\"It's tough because I'm a New Yorker and I would love to see the Mets do well. But I'd love the see the film be right. So I'm torn,\" Fox said before the game ended, adding \"Whatever happens, happens.\" \nChristopher Lloyd who played Doc Brown said he didn't really follow the predictions, except for that one. \n\"I'm hoping the Cubs win tonight and go into the series, that would be the ultimate prediction,\" Lloyd said with a bit of trepidation. \nBut that was not to be. \nThe New York Mets defeated the Cubs 8-3 Wednesday in the National League Championship series. They will advance to the World Series. \n\"Back to the Future Part II\" envisioned more than baseball. It depicted a colorful 2015 with flying cars, hoverboards and self-tying shoelaces. While those doodads are hardly prevalent today, the film did accurately tease the rise of flat-screen televisions, biometric scanning and hands-free gaming. \nAccording to writer and co-creator Bob Gale, most of the predictions, including the one about the Cubs \"were intended to be jokes.\" \n\"The most far-fetched prediction was that lawyers would be abolished in the future. We didn't expect that would happen, but you put stuff in the movie you're going to enjoy,\" joked Gale. \n\"Back to the Future\" Day was celebrated around the country on Wednesday. It marked the day in 1985 that Marty McFly, along with Emmett \"Doc\" Brown and Jennifer Parker traveled in their souped-up DeLorean time machine to 2015 in the sci-fi film trilogy's second installment in 1989. \n\"Back to the Future\" filmmaker Robert Zemeckis' trilogy has left a lasting impression on pop culture in the 30 years since the original film debuted, spawning a theme park attraction, video game and animated series. \nThe town of Reston, Virginia ceremoniously changed its name to Hill Valley, McFly's fictional hometown. Washington, D.C.'s Washington West Film Festival featured a marathon screening of the trilogy and will have a Sunday screening of the original film. Stars Christopher Lloyd and Claudia Wells, as well as screenwriter-producer Bob Gale will attend. \nOther celebrations in California included a tour of the Hill Valley town square on the Universal Studios lot, an \"Enchantment Under the Sea\" dance at the Hollywood United Methodist Church and a screening in the parking lot of the Puente Hills Mall, where McFly famously blasted off in the DeLorean. There also was the Million McFly March, a gathering of fans dressed as McFly that began at the Burbank, California, location of the Burger King restaurant depicted in \"Back to the Future.\" \nFor those who didn't want to leave home, the trilogy was streamed on Amazon Prime. Universal also is releasing a special edition trilogy box set in light-up packaging resembling Doc Brown's flux capacitor. \nOnline:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:58:00.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
