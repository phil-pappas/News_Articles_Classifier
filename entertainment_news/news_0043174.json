Instead we're going to tell you that doctors have said so, thus absolving ourselves of any of your future medical problems.\nA recent Annals of Internal Medicine study has said that a glass of red wine once a day is the perfect amount for your body, as it allows you to avail of its health benefits without the side effects of overdoing it.\nResearchers from the Ben-Gurion University in Negev, Israel, set out to find how safe it was for people with type-2 diabetes to drink in small amounts, as they are more likely to develop cardiovascular disease than those with the condition.\nThe study was done with 224 diabetics who didn't drink wine. Well, they didn't when they started, but after being prescribed five ounces of the stuff per day, they probably do now.\nThe group was divided between people who would drink red wine, white wine, and water. They would also adhere to a Mediterranean diet that involved calorie restrictions.\nOver the course of two years, the researchers checked the biomarkers of glycemic control, lipids and liver function, and found that those who were on the red wine significantly increased their levels of good HDL cholesterol, something diabetics generally suffer from.\nThey also had the components of metabolic syndrome drop, and had a better nights sleep than the other two groups.\nRight, a lot of that even went over our head, basically what we've taken from it is drink some red wine and eat like we're Italian. Seems like a diet we might be able to stick to.\nVia Metro\nMORE: Wetherspoons to double their number of pubs in Ireland over the next 18 months\nMORE: There's a Harry Potter themed cocktail bar and we're already reserving out seats\nMORE: This is what beer does to your body an hour after drinking it", "external_links": ["http://metro.co.uk/2015/10/13/drinking-red-wine-every-day-could-keep-the-doctor-away-5438576/"], "published": "2015-10-14T19:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T15:47:42.559+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
