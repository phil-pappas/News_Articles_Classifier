The eleven-time recipient of the Bronze Star Medal died in Kirkuk Province.\nMaster Sgt. Joshua L. Wheeler, 39, a native of Roland, Oklahoma, died Oct. 22, 2015, from wounds received by enemy small-arms fire during a mission with the Kurdish Peshmerga Forces to rescue hostages who were said to be in imminent danger. Master Sgt. Wheeler was assigned Headquarters U.S. Army Special Operations Command, Fort Bragg , North Carolina.\nThe Special Forces Soldier's death is the first combat loss since Sgt. 1st Class Dennis R. Murray, 38, of Red Boiling Springs, Tennessee, died Nov. 21, 2011. Sgt. Murray died when insurgents attacked his unit with an improvised explosive device. He was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 34th Armor Regiment, 1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division at Fort Riley, Kansas.\nNBC reported today that Master Sgt. Wheeler graduated from high school Muldrow, Oklahoma, in 1994, and entered the infantry one year later where he trained at the Army's Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia. He was deployed overseas five times with the Ranger Regiment and 12 times with the Army Special Operations Command.\nNews sources reported earlier today that the special ops commander on the ground made the ultimate decision for his troops to enter the compound where the hostages were being held. Seventy people were rescued in the mission, some of whom were ISIS fighters who had been imprisoned by their own commanders.\nKurdish intel said the prison was holding captured Kurdish troops, however the rescue instead freed several local Arab civilians, approximately 20 Iraqi soldiers or security forces and six ISIS/ISIL fighters accused of being traitors to the terrorist cause.\nAdditional information on Master Sgt. Wheeler, including previous deployments and commendations, is available to media sources by contacting the U.S. Army Special Operations Command Public Affairs Office in North Carolina, 910-432-6005.", "external_links": ["http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/respectful-american-commando-killed-iraq-was-no-stranger-war-n450041", "http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/10/23/defense-secretary-absolutely-prepared-for-more-u-s-ground-combat-in-iraq/", "http://archive.defense.gov/Releases/Release.aspx?ReleaseID=14943", "http://www.defense.gov/News/News-Releases/News-Release-View/Article/625690/dod-identifies-army-casualty"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:42:44.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
