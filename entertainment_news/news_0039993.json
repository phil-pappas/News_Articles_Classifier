More important, McCann's remarkable range of color, texture, tone and nuance very nearly overwhelmed the ear. How could this much sonic variety and interpretive imagination possibly issue from a single artist's voice?\nChicagoans already are aware of McCann's gifts, her profile having risen steadily here and across the country during the past few years. But, true to form, McCann caught listeners a bit off-guard in several regards.\nFor starters, her ongoing partnership with Chicago guitarist Mike Allemana deepened the impact of this performance, McCann often duetting with Allemana while the rest of the band played along. To hear an instrument as sumptuous as McCann's riffing alongside Allemana's buoyant lines on guitar was to savor two first-rate jazz improvisers reveling in spontaneous interaction.\nThen, too, several of the evening's arrangements cast welcome new light on the familiar music at hand, rendering just about everything freshly urgent. Perhaps the welcome fact that this performance was being recorded for a forthcoming \"Live at the Jazz Showcase\" album heightened McCann's long-running interest in keeping listeners guessing.\nTammy McCann Chris Sweda / Chicago Tribune (L to R) Jeremy Kahn, Tammy McCann, Marlene Rosenberg, Mike Allemana, and Clif Wallace, perform at Jazz Showcase in Chicago on Thursday, October 8, 2015.\n(L to R) Jeremy Kahn, Tammy McCann, Marlene Rosenberg, Mike Allemana, and Clif Wallace, perform at Jazz Showcase in Chicago on Thursday, October 8, 2015.\n(Chris Sweda / Chicago Tribune) Nowhere was McCann more persuasive than in her slow-and-sensuous account of \"You Go to My Head.\" Though offered as a tribute to this year's Billie Holiday centennial, McCann's version sounded unlike Holiday's or anyone else's, thanks to McCann's dusky tones, tautly controlled vibrato and phrases that seemed to stretch on forever. The romantic infatuation that the song was penned to convey radiated from every passing note.\nDuke Ellington's \"Sophisticated Lady\" does not need many more retellings at this point, but McCann tested herself — and her audience — with a daring version. The Latin instrumental undercurrent put rhythmic accents in unexpected places, while the band's aggressive accompaniment provided considerable tension with the vocal line. Though the instrumentalists were over-amplified here (and elsewhere), there was no denying the fascination of hearing McCann wend her way through a maze of ensemble sound.\nPart of the pleasure of any McCann performance derives from her scat singing, and she took flight in Rodgers and Hart's \"I Didn't Know What Time It Was.\" The flurry of pitches McCann produced didn't merely spark vocal pyrotechnics, however, the singer giving weight, meaning and shape to her fast-flying lines. Her partnership with guitarist Allemana shone here, the two creating jazz counterpoint that sustained a propulsive sense of swing.\nTammy McCann Chris Sweda / Chicago Tribune Vocalist Tammy McCann performs at Jazz Showcase in Chicago on Thursday, October 8, 2015.\nVocalist Tammy McCann performs at Jazz Showcase in Chicago on Thursday, October 8, 2015.\n(Chris Sweda / Chicago Tribune) In \"Tea for Two,\" of all things, McCann and Allemana gleefully toyed with rhythms and expectations, finding intriguing ways to subvert a four-square tune. They were joined in their mischief by pianist Jeremy Kahn, bassist Marlene Rosenberg and drummer Clif Wallace, who kept pace with McCann and Allemana throughout the set.\nIf McCann's classic dance-band tempo on \"Body and Soul\" made one wish to hear her ballad rendition of the tune, there was something to be said for her bracingly unsentimental approach. And McCann wasn't kidding when she announced that her salute to this year's Frank Sinatra centennial was going to take Ol' Blue Eyes to the South Side of Chicago, her blues-drenched reading of \"I've Got the World on a String\" rich in throaty low notes and raspy, gritty growls.\nNow that's singing.\nHoward Reich is a Tribune critic.\nhreich@tribpub.com\nTwitter @howardreich\nWhen : 8 and 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday; 4, 8 and 10 p.m. Sunday\nWhere : Jazz Showcase, 806 S.
