The little ones will love it, the adults have better movies to see. --THV11.com 10/09/15 KTHV \nPan is the story of an orphan boy named Peter (Levi Miller) who is whisked away from his orphanage to the Neverland. Why is he whisked away? So he can work in the mines controlled by the pirate Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman). What are they mining for? A mineral called Pixum i.e. Fairy Dust and they never explain why. Peter makes a friend in the mine named James Hook (Garrett Hedlund) who helps him escape to the forest where he encounters the natives led by a young warrior named Tiger Lilly (Rooney Mara) where he learns of his true destiny and along with his new friends sets out to stop Blackbeard from destroying the Fairy Kingdom. \nI have a few problems with this movie. I don't know where to start. First of all, I don't know that anyone was jumping out of their seats to make a prequel to Peter Pan, or that there was even a desire to have a reboot of it. Second, there were technical issues in the film. Some shots were out of focus, there were scenes that cut abruptly from one location another. In one moment the Neverland Tribe is excited that Peter might be the \"Pan\" but the scene abruptly cuts to everyone gathered around the memory tree. In another, Blackbeard is standing on the edge of a tree bridge watching Peter fall to the ground and when Peter falls to the ground, Blackbeard is suddenly standing right next to him. Speaking of memory trees, Neverland seems to be filled with memory objects since our trio of heroes end up in a \"memory charged\" lagoon. It really seems as the writers or director either couldn't figure out how to make those transitions or they just made it up as they went along. Third, can someone explain how Nirvana lyrics have anything to do with the story of Peter Pan? Specifically, the song \"Smells like Teen Spirit\"? I can't figure that one out either but all the pirates and miners are engaged in a sing-a-long of it when Peter arrives in Neverland. Fourth, this movie as a prequel lets you down on every expectation you have for it. \nYou'd expect to see how Captain Hook and Peter became enemies, right? Doesn't happen. You'd expect to at least see how Captain Hook lost his hand to a Crocodile, right? Doesn't happen. You'd at least expect there to be some sort of direct confrontation between Peter (the hero) and Blackbeard (the villain), right? Doesn't happen. It's clear at this point that the studio is hoping to turn this into a trilogy and by doing so they have robbed the audience of anything they would hope to see in this movie. \nHere's the bottom line, kids will like Pan and that's the audience it is intended to reach. As for adults, there are far better movies to see this weekend.
