Russell directing them, because I'm a creep and so is he): \"I guess the question has to be answered: When are you two going to have sex? Everyone's been waiting for that.\"\nCooper answered with a firm and rather convincing \"Never.\"\n\"It just didn't happen,\" he said. \"It's not the way we are together.\"\nA few years back, Cooper dismissed a red carpet question about a J. Law romance by pointing out that she is in fact 15 years younger than him. \"And that became a thing because the girl I was seeing was as young as she was.\"\nStern didn't miss an opportunity to get in a dig: \"In a way, is she on the verge of being too old to be with you?\"\n\"Absolutely not,\" Cooper said. \"That's a bit insulting. That hurt.\"\nJoy , the next installment of the Bradley Cooper-Jennifer Lawrence show, opens on Christmas Day.\nh/t BroBible", "external_links": ["http://www.brobible.com/entertainment/article/bradley-cooper-jennifer-lawrence-wont-do-it/", "https://soundcloud.com/howardstern/bradleycooper_jenniferlawrence"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:26:23.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
