The show has been both a creative and ratings triumph for the network. On the Sunday before its final episode, PBS will air a marathon of the season up to that point and a behind-the-scenes program on how the show was made. The network will also try to use \"Downton Abbey\" as a launching pad for \"Mercy Street,\" a Civil War drama premiering Jan. 17 directly after an episode of the outgoing hit. PBS also has a new two-part Ken Burns documentary on Jackie Robinson that will premiere in April to coincide with the start of a new baseball season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:00:11.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
