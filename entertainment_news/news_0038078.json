As the only mobile repair service of its kind in a sizable geographic area, this business is positioned for sustainable and high growth into the future. The owner focuses on less automated equipment that most farmers and ranchers still operate and have trouble getting serviced at reasonable rates. The seller currently operates at approximately 60% of most area service rates and the opportunity to quickly increase profits can be realized with a simple rate increase. The seller also commits zero resources to marketing but could materially increase sales with a simple customer outreach program. While the seller has chosen to remain small with no employees, the new owner would have the opportunity to grow the service significantly and quickly, making this business a fantastic opportunity for the mechanically inclined individual. Selling Price: $140,000 For more information, please contact Dexter Sherman @ 406-655-3285.
