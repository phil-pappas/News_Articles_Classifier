Gwyneth Paltrow has opened up to say how she felt when she met Oprah Friday. \nPaltrow posted an image or herself and Oprah to her Instagram account, with the comment that she was “sh***ing in her pants” when she met up with the media and talk show icon at a luncheon event Friday. A photo posted by Gwyneth Paltrow (@gwynethpaltrow) on Oct 9, 2015 at 2:42pm PDT \nGwyneth was with Oprah Winfrey at the 2015 Variety Power of Women event. Presented by Lifetime, the event was a luncheon held at the Four Seasons Beverly Wilshire hotel in Beverley Hills. \n— Janine Lew (@varietyjl) October 9, 2015 \nGwyneth Paltrow and Oprah Winfrey were both there to be recognized for their work in raising awareness to a variety of different charitable causes. As can be seen in the video below, Gwyneth looked fresh and beautiful in a crisp and smart white dress. <noscript><iframe id=\"molvideoplayer\" title=\"MailOnline Embed Player\" src=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/embed/video/1220401.html\" width=\"698\" height=\"573\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></noscript> It seems Oprah isn’t the only celeb to cause Paltrow to get that “star-struck” feeling. She also admitted to being intimidated when she met the James Bond star Daniel Craig last month. Strangely, it seems they were friends before he became James Bond, but for some reason after he achieved that status, he made her nervous. \n“If you’re friends with someone before they become James Bond, and then they become James Bond and you’re nervous to see them at a party because they are now James Bond, is that weird?” \nGwyneth Paltrow posted a photo on Instagram of that meeting too. A photo posted by Gwyneth Paltrow (@gwynethpaltrow) on Sep 13, 2015 at 3:32pm PDT \nOn a more serious note, in an interview with Variety for its Power of Women issue, Gwyneth Paltrow spoke up about the imbalance in salary between female and male actors, saying that being paid less than her male co-stars makes her feel “sh*tty.” She explained how painful it can be. \n“Your salary is a way to quantify what you’re worth. If men are being paid a lot more for doing the same thing, it feels sh*tty.” \nSpeaking of her role in the highest-grossing film franchise of all time, she said she is uncomfortable with the discrepancy between the salaries. Paltrow plays the role of Pepper Potts in the Iron Man films alongside Robert Downey Jr. and while she is aware that his role is more important than hers, she doesn’t feel the salaries are fair. \n“Look, nobody is worth the money that Robert Downey Jr. is worth, but if I told you the disparity, you would probably be surprised.” \nReportedly Paltrow is the 12 th highest-paid actress worldwide this year and has earned $9 million, while Jennifer Lawrence is the number one highest-paid actress at $52 million for the year. However, Downey Jr. clocks in as the highest-paid male actor at an annual salary of $80 million. \nWatch: Gwyneth Paltrow’s inspirational speech at today’s #PowerOfWomen luncheon http://t.co/1JLvsxM3Ux pic.twitter.com/r0vVNGwO85 \n— Variety (@Variety) October 10, 2015 \nIn what was dubbed an “inspirational speech” at Variety’s Power of Women event, Paltrow said there is still a long way to go, but that Hollywood is finally on the verge of creating a new archetype for women who can be both maternal and sexual. \nAccording to E! Online , Gwyneth explained that when she was a young woman in Hollywood , if you were focused on building your career you were “labeled ‘ambitious’ and it was a bad word.” \nShe said that was said with disgust, so she personally adopted “a kind of an oh-how-did-this-happen-to-me approach” believing that wanting success was somehow a bad thing. However today she says the power of women “rings a bit differently and you could feel the shift.” \nWatch her speech below where she explains the work of L.A. Kitchen, in which she is involved and how so-called unattractive food, normally discarded is used to feed the needy. <noscript><iframe src=\"http://video-cdn.variety.com/players/iMlFDsSk-plsZnDJi.html\" width=\"320\" height=\"260\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"auto\"></noscript> \nIt seems the fact that she gets star-struck with Oprah Winfrey or Daniel Craig does not take anything away from the excellent work Gwyneth Paltrow is doing towards the power of women and other people in this world. \n[Photo: Gwyneth Paltrow by Frazer Harrison /Getty Images Entertainment]", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T17:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:36:56.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
