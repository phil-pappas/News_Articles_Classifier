There have been over 598,882 free downloads in 218 countries. Soon there will be millions. This model will be followed by many other organizations and the vast distribution of free ebooks will change the world.\nNEW YORK , Oct. 8, Around 1440 Johannes Gutenberg devised a printing system that made books far less expensive than handwritten manuscripts. Many others followed and this increase in communication was monumental. Today the International Psychotherapy Institute (IPI) has shown how books can be downloaded free to computers, tablets and phones throughout the world. As other organizations follow this model, there will be an immense increase in communication.\nHow is this possible? Ebooks have no costs for paper, printing, binding, warehousing, or shipping, and, since in return for extensive distribution, authors are often willing to give up royalties, these books are free. Readers in 218 countries have already downloaded over 500,000 ebooks from the IPI site. Soon there will be millions. Just as Gutenberg's printing press, this will change the world.\n\"My symbol books were offered on the IPI Website. Within weeks 11,000 volumes had been downloaded.\" - Charles Sarnoff M.D .\n\"I now have readers all over the world. Cumulatively, I have 35,000 downloads.\" - Jerome D.
