(Hopper Stone, SMPSP / Sony Pictures) Katie Walsh, Tribune Newspapers \"Goosebumps\" is spooky good. \nSilly, spooky monster mash-up \"Goosebumps\" doesn't have to be as good as it is. Slyly smarter and more entertaining than it appears, adults might have just as much fun as the kids who will undoubtedly gobble up this Halloween treat. A sort of PG version of \"Cabin in the Woods,\" this adaptation of R.L. Stine's series of young adult horror novels is bolstered by a stellar comedic cast, headed up by the inimitable Jack Black in the role of the author. \nWith so many \"Goosebumps\" books to choose from, story writers Larry Karaszewski and Scott Alexander (with screenplay by Darren Lemke), chose to reverse engineer all of the titles into one film, with author Stine as a main character. The result is a clever, meta take on monster tales and what purpose they can serve for the writer. \nNew kid in town Zach (Dylan Minnette) befriends his beguiling next door neighbor Hannah (Odeya Rush), despite the disapproval of her intimidating dad (Black). When he suspects Hannah's in danger and the bumbling local police can't help, Zach breaks into her house with his delightfully goofy friend Champ (the excellent Ryan Lee). Inside the creepy mansion, Zach and Champ discover a stash of \"Goosebumps\" manuscripts, that when unlocked, release the monsters from the pages and into the world. Turns out Hannah's dad is one Mr. R.L. Stine, who took his own personal demons and put them on the page, before they eventually became real. \nAnd so begins the wild goose chase through the tiny town of Madison, Del., as Zach, Hannah, Champ and R.L. Stine attempt to stuff the rampaging monsters back into the books. This is complicated by the leadership of revenge-happy villainous ventriloquist dummy, Slappy, who doesn't appreciate being locked up on the bookshelf. \nThe script is funny and sharp, and filled with references that most older horror fans will appreciate, from \"Teen Wolf\" to \"The Shining,\" but the film errs more on the side of slapstick than scary. A murderer's row of comic talent backs up Black who, in his scenery chewing best, sets the tone and the standard for the rest. \"Workaholics\" star Jillian Bell is a hilarious stand-out as Zach's kooky aunt, and comics such as Ken Marino and \"Veep\" player Timothy Simons pepper the supporting roles.

Some of the resolutions are a bit too neat and facile, but \"Goosebumps\" is chockablock with humor, heart, and whole lot of fun, thanks mostly to the committed cast, who are game for anything. \"Goosebumps\" is a fun, nostalgic popcorn flick that reminds us that monsters can still be child's play. \n\"Goosebumps\" â€” 3 stars", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:16:49.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
