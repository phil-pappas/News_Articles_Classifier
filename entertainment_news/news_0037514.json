In the 1960s, when the twins were the gangland kings of London's East End, David Bailey photographed them gazing insouciantly into the lens, taking their place as subjects alongside models, pop stars, actors and aristocrats. Monty Python referenced them as the Piranha Brothers in a 1970 sketch, and in Peter Medak's 1990 film The Krays they were played by Martin and Gary Kemp from New Romantic poster boys Spandau Ballet. \nAdvertisement For Legend , writer-director Brian Helgeland has an attention-grabbing casting trick up his sleeve: Tom Hardy plays both brothers. Hardy is an adventurous actor, physically assertive and seemingly drawn to roles that require transformation and challenge. And there are precedents for this kind of double act, most memorably Jeremy Irons in David Cronenberg's Dead Ringers . \nBut the movie never really gives Hardy enough to work with. It sets the template early, and feels oversimplified from the start. Ron – a dangerously volatile figure who ended up in a psychiatric institution – is a loose cannon, while Reg seems to be  something akin to a romantic lead, undone by fraternal loyalty. \nVisually, Hardy and Helgeland have created a sense of difference between the brothers. Reg is handsome and debonair; he's got James Dean swept-up hair and looks sharp in a dinner jacket.\nRon wears glasses and holds himself very stiffly. He's expressionless and unpredictable, an autodidact who often sees himself and his world in mythic terms, who seems incapable of filtering his thoughts. Hardy speaks in a deep, muffled voice that sounds as though he's talking underwater.\nThe film begins with the brothers on top of the world, fronting night clubs, sought out by the rich and famous, as well as major gangland figures from the US. Ron, who is gay, hosts parties that attract figures from the British establishment  – contacts that turn out to be extremely helpful at a certain point.\nMedak's version emphasised the importance of the twins' mother, played by Billie Whitelaw. In Legend , Helgeland gives us a key female figure, Frances (Emily Browning), the young woman who became Reg's wife. Her significance is established a little awkwardly: she has another kind of double role, constructed as a melancholy onlooker who's also a narrator.\nHer knowing, wry voice-over explains about the Krays and their world, but the self-reflexive narrative persona is rather different from the character we see on screen: a phantom presence, a wide-eyed figure unable to escape her fate, whose fragility is referred to but never really explored.\nFrances was 16 when she caught Reg's eye, and he wooed and married her. She is eager to leave the East End, but drawn to Reg. She thinks he's beautiful, and she wants him to be good. She knows what he is but would like him to be something else. He makes half-hearted promises to change his life, but there's nothing Helgeland shows to suggest he wanted to. \nThe film has a certain sameness. The violence at the beginning is jaunty, verging on comical, even at dangerous moments. A vicious fight that marks a dramatic fracture in the brothers' relationship becomes a spectacle, a bravura special effects moment accompanied by drum solo.\nHelgeland, who wrote the screenplay for LA Confidential and whose films as a director include A Knight's Tale and 42 , gives us some familiar BritCrim tropes and the odd GoodFellas moment. He can be too literal or too obvious far too often. Music cues – Chapel Of Love for the wedding, I'm Into Something Good for the upbeat times – are hardly subtle, and the narration often explains what we see. \nThe cast members have graced many a British gangster movie. Most of the supporting roles are straightforward, one-note affairs or calculatedly overheated turns, but David Thewlis​ gives a relaxed performance as the twins' key offsider, the man who tried – with increasing difficulty – to put the emphasis on the \"organised\" part of organised crime.  \nLegend is currently screening.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T13:18:52.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
