Enlarge... \nBelfast Creative Coalition’s Cultivate: Belfast Area Farm and Art Fall Tour is set for Saturday and Sunday, Oct. 10 and 11, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. each day. The Columbus Day weekend tour includes open studios, farm tours and special workshops and demonstrations. \nTour-goers can visit artists working in their studios, watch a glass blowing demonstration and learn how farmers are entrepreneurs creating artistic consumer products from what they cultivate. This year, the tour is divided into two areas: Southern Waldo County locations (including a Knox County inclusion in Appleton) will be open Saturday and Northern Waldo County’s on Sunday. \nWaldo County has a rare combination of farmers and artists: the farmers are creative and the artists keep a hand in the dirt. There are farmers that make fiddles, print original woodcuts or create their visions on canvas; and there are artists raising sheep, making cheese, harvesting and processing food. The love of place, embracing the handmade and being “local” are ubiquitous. The Cultivate Fall Tour celebrates and appreciates this universal spirit. \nFarming and art-making are creative, responsive acts, and both farmers and artists are deeply involved in process. These entrepreneurs work on a small, human and local scale. Their work requires discipline and careful time management to create the fruits they share with their community. \nHighlights this year include the studios of David Estey, Kenny Cole, Betsy Levine and David Jacobson. Visitors are encouraged to bring their families and visit artists’ working in their studios, see a glass blowing demonstration or learn how to make soap. \nThe Belfast Creative Coalition website has full descriptions and images of the tour sites and suggested nearby attractions. All locations are within 30 to 45 minutes driving time from Belfast. \nThe self-guided tour is free, although donations are appreciated. Maps are available for download at belfastcreativecoalition.org and can be picked up at the Belfast Visitor Center, 14 Main St., Belfast. For more information, visit the BCC website; call 323-8692; or check out the tour’s Facebook page . \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
