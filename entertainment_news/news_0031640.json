However, he has struggled to break through in a crowded Republican primary where voters are so far rewarding unorthodox candidates such as billionaire Donald Trump and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson.\nThe moves announced to staff on Friday will reduce the campaign's payroll by 40%, while also cutting travel costs by 20% and eliminating extraneous overhead costs.\nThe changes will predominantly affect staff at Bush's Miami campaign headquarters. Only about 25% of campaign staff will remain in Florida. Another one-fourth of the staff was already in early voting states, and the remaining Bush aides will either be offered jobs there or other posts at reduced salaries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:26:02.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
