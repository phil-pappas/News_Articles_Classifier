The former NBA star has been in a medically induced coma since he was found face-down and unconscious at the Love Ranch brothel in Nevada on Tuesday, but Rev. Jesse Jackson says there's \"some responsiveness now.\" A new source tells ET that he may be improving, briefly fluttering his eyes open and Khloe's sister Kim Kardashian thinks he squeezed her hand. TMZ notes it could be involuntary movement, and their sources say his condition has deteriorated. Multiple reports say he's suffered kidney failure and has a 50-50 chance of survival, but doctors are hopeful as more tests are being performed.\n» Read more at the New York Daily News .\nRumors about \"Fantastic Four\" are flying, suggesting Marvel Studios has reached a deal with 20th Century Fox to take over the superhero quartet for a 2020 movie in exchange for X-Men TV rights to planned \"Legion\" and \"Hellfire\" projects. After this summer's reboot flopped, fans were excited Marvel could rescue the franchise like it plans to do after acquiring \"Spider-Man\" from Sony. However, sources at Marvel and Fox both say it's not true and \"Fantastic Four 2\" is still (probably) happening.\n» Read more at Den of Geek .\nChristopher Lloyd says he'd do \"Back to the Future 4\" even if it's not likely to happen. \"I would love to do Doc again, no question,\" the 76-year-old actor said. But the story must be as good as the original time travel trilogy, and all the major players -- including Michael J. Fox -- would have to be involved: \"I think regardless of the Parkinson's, he'd probably jump on [playing Marty McFly again] and he'd be great. I can't see doing another sequel without him. I would certainly want Bob Zemeckis directing it, Bob Gale writing it and the other principals being involved.\" Great Scott!\n» Read more at Slash Film .\nSpeaking of \"BTTF,\" a new College Humor video explores \"Back to the Future\" in the real 2015 . A cartoon Marty McFly is disappointed to discover there are no flying cars, hoverboards or Nikes with power laces -- just Crocs and Internet bullying. Next week marks the date \"Part II\" traveled to in the future, and a lot of its predictions are wrong... though there's still a chance the Chicago Cubs could win the World Series.\nAnd Showtime's \"Homeland\" was sabotaged by artists hired to draw Arabic graffiti on the set of a Syrian refugee camp. They took advantage of the opportunity to criticize the Claire Danes show's \"highly biased depiction of Arabs, Pakistanis, and Afghans\" by writing \"Homeland is not a series,\" \"#blacklivesmatter\" and \"Homeland is racist\" on the second episode of the current, fifth season. Showrunner Alex Gansa said he wished they caught the images before they aired, but he \"can't help but admire this act of artistic sabotage.\"\n» See photos and read more at the Daily Mail .\nMore Buzz:\n» NY school principal in hot water over raunchy rap video with Trey Songz ( AP )\n» 'Fargo' creator Noah Hawley developing X-Men TV show 'Legion' for Fox ( SF )\n» Khloe Kardashian slams brothel owner for using Odom for publicity ( NYDN )\n» Travis Barker recalls dating Paris Hilton, flirting with Kim Kardashian in '06 ( FW )\n» Video: Young Katy Perry sings backup for Christian rap metal band P.O.D.
