Photo: Elesa Kurtz \nCanberra is on its way to becoming the pop-up capital with the phenomenon so far giving us shops, galleries, bars and restaurants.\nBut the brains behind the latest pop-up venture hopes to bring design and art together with an open air theatre in the heart of the city for two weeks in November.\nAspen Island Theatre Company artistic director Julian Hobba​ said the theatre's design at Civic Square would hark back to the classical Greek theatre, but would come to life with common materials like scaffolding and clear roofing to create a light box effect.\nAn artist's impression of the Public Theatre at Civic Square. Photo: Cox Architecture \n\"All these stars kind of aligned, this urge I had to do an outdoor theatre project, a possibility to incorporate it into Design Canberra [festival] in a way that expanded Canberra's growing reputation for pop-up architecture but in an original incarnation… it's kind of been a bit more about retail up until now,\" he said.\nAdvertisement \"I wanted a space where we could concentrate on great ideas, great words and the power of the body, performances that don't rely on big sets or props but just really concentrate on the human experience at the heart of drama.\"\nHobba said the pop-up theatre and bar would offer a unique theatre-going experience where no two performances in the line-up of plays, films, gigs and spoken word acts would be the same.\n\"It will be unlike the experience you have in the Canberra Theatre Centre or the Street Theatre… it could be quite magical to sit in this space and have a different relationship with the performer… with art and public space,\" he said.\n\"There might be moments that really don't work and other moments that will be pure bliss… it's got a lot more variables to it.\"\nOne of the variables the open air theatre will have to contend with is the weather.\nIn the event of rain Hobba said most shows would be cancelled and refunded but the show may go on for some.\nHighlights of the fortnight run include Sappho , a one-woman play in homage to its Ancient Greek lesbian love poet namesake, a one-man \"sci-fi cabaret musical\" Bomb Collar by Canberra writer Nick Delatovic​ and a comedic one-man version of Hamlet .\nThere will also be a poetry night from BAD!SLAM!NO!BISCUIT!, orations on Australian Republicanism and significant speeches from Greek democracy, and gigs from Canberra bands Young Monks, Cracked Actor and new folk duo Cass & Dave featuring Cassidy Richens​ and Dave O'Neill.\nThe public theatre from November 17 to 29 will also coincide with the SpringOUT Pride festival and Design Canberra, the second annual event showcasing Canberra's design arts culture.\nFor the full program and to buy tickets visit: AITC.org.au.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:48:09.331+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
