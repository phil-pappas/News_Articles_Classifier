James Van Der Beek and Patricia Arquette in CSI: Cyber (Monty Brinton/CBS) \nShe said: “Basically what I’ve learned is everything can be hacked so everything can be repurposed from how it was originally intended into something else. \n“My phone is just a phone, I don’t do email on my phone. I always tell people when they’re taking pictures to turn off their locations on their apps because people don’t know there’s metadata on those photographs. I don’t do online banking. But this (show) has made me more nervous than I was before.” \nPatricia, who stars alongside James Van Der Beek in the Channel 5 crime drama, said she is glad to pave the way and be the first female lead on a CSI show, following William Petersen, Gary Sinise, David Caruso and Ted Danson in previous programmes. \n“I was proud to be asked to be the first female lead on CSI. This franchise is a huge global franchise that changed entertainment television, so to be part of it is great,” she explained. Promoted stories \nThe Boyhood star made a passionate speech at the 2015 Oscars after she won the best supporting actress prize, where she called for wage equality between men and women. \n“Really, what I was talking about in that speech is the millions of women who aren’t in Hollywood and women in the world having to deal with this,” she explained. \n“A lot of those women are just sole breadwinners for their children and when they’re being economically suppressed because of their gender or colour, then they’re really at a terrible disadvantage and we should not allow that to happen any more.” Patricia Arquette (Rich Fury/Invision) \nPatricia plans to help change things by doing her bit. \nShe said: “I want to play all different kinds of women, and I love men very much. I love coupling and I love being in a relationship. I love all of that, I love family but there’s so many different women’s stories to tell and I’ll never be able to tell all the ones I’d like to. \n“I’m working on trying to get the rights for a couple of things as a director. I’d like to direct other women and support them.” Share article \nCSI: Cyber continues at 10pm on Channel 5 on Tuesdays.
