He has three CMJ shows, all of which are sold out, so get there early if you're using a badge.\" \nS , Knitting Factory, 9:15 p.m. (also performing Sat. at Knitting Factory) —\" Carissa's Wierd singer Jenn Ghetto has been making music under the moniker S since before Carissa's Wierd broke up,\" Sacher said. \n\"Last year she released her first full-band album under that moniker and it's really great stuff. S played last year but we didn't get to catch her, so we're glad to get another chance.\" \nThe Gotobeds , Knitting Factory, 10:25 p.m. (also performing Fri. at Cake Shop) —\"Former tourmates, [The Gotobeds and Protomartyr] share a similar worldview (and love of The Fall) and bleak sense of humor,\" said Pearis. \n\"The Gotobeds are playing multiple times during CMJ too, definitely worth catching.\" \nProtomartyr , Knitting Factory, 12:10 a.m. (also performing Weds. at Santos Party House and Fri. at Rough Trade) —\"Few current bands channel the pent-up vibe better than Detroit's Protomartyr who just released their masterful third album, 'The Agent Intellect',\" Pearis said. \n►Friday, October 16th \nCar Seat Headrest , Rough Trade, 7:30 p.m. (also performing Weds. at Pianos and Santos Party House) —\"[This is] one of the bands we're most excited to see,\" said Sacher. \"They just signed to Matador Records, and [are] playing a bunch of shows,\" Sacher added. \nDestruction Unit , Baby's All Right, 8 p.m. —\"[These] Arizona psych punks are truly one of those bands who are different every time you see them. If you can, catch them twice or maybe three times at CMJ. It's a real trip,\" said Sacher. \nShopping , Music Hall of Williamsburg, 9:15 p.m. (also performing Weds. at Pianos) —\"[Their] brittle, herky-jerky rhythms and shouted choruses recall early-'80s post punk,\" said Bill Pearis. \nThe Band Called FUSE , Littlefield, 10:30 p.m. (also performing Sat. at Littlefield) —\"An exciting fusion band, mixing rock, hip hop, funk and doing it the right way. They'll be recording their first live abum over these two nights. This is my pick of the entire festival,\" said Faces. \nPhony PPL , The Wick, 11:30 p.m. (also performing Weds. at Arlene's Grocery) — Phoney PPL's exceptional live instrumentation could bring some high energy to [the festival],\" said Faces. \n►Saturday, October 17th \nThe Wonder Years , Webster Hall, 7 p.m. —\"The Wonder Years are a polished pop punk whose ambitious new record 'No Closer to Heaven' is good enough to win over people who otherwise never listen to polished pop punk,\" Sacher noted. \n\"It's a cathartic release that anyone who's ever lost a loved one can relate to, and it's even more intense live.\" \nCross Culture , Black Bear Bar, 10 p.m. —\"This show should be a good catch. [This] act is part of a burgeoning alt-hip hop vibe that is producing a lot of cool genre-blending bands and music around NYC,\" said the Birthplace editor-in-chief. \nStro , Drom, 10:30 p.m. —\"Former boy wonder and X-Factor competitor will be rocking an equally diverse show at DROM,\" said Faces. \nTicket information for the CMJ Festival can be found here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T14:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:57:53.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
