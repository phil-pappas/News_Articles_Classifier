Especially when it's being rolled out here, unlike those chickens from Kentucky. \nFirst, I called up Jason Henderson, the head chef for the Captain's chain of 500-plus restaurants. With a degree in fisheries management and a diploma from the Culinary Institute of America, Henderson isn't your typical corporate chef. He's also unafraid to stake his claim in this battle. \n\"We're spiceheads,\" he says of the culinary team, which travels the country a few times a year to suss out the best \"indigenous dishes.\" \nBesides Nashville, Henderson says they've rolled it out this week in Jacksonville and St. Louis as well, which makes about 60 stores across all three markets. First though, they tested in two stores here in Nashville: one on Nolensville Road and the other on Eighth Avenue South. If that rings a bell, that's because it's right next door to Bolton's Spicy Chicken and Fish. Whoa, that's gutsy. \nHere's where it gets interesting. Henderson admits that spicy foods haven't really done that well in past tests. \"When we framed it under the 'Nashville hot' label, it was almost like this...acceptance. When we taste-tested it we did two levels because of our history of our guests not being that approachable to the spicy items. One was a medium level, and one was a much hotter level, and the one that overwhelmingly got the best satisfaction and taste scores was the hotter of the two.\" \nOnce they got the green light, getting the recipe was the easy part, because the spice blend was one they already had in their test kitchen. \"We put it on just about everything,\" says Henderson.\"It has a cayenne base, but we've added a lot of other components. It's not all about heat, it's about the flavor. We stand behind it. We think it's one of the best recipes among the hot chicken recipes out there.\" Whoa, again the gutsy chest thumping. \nWhen I asked him about a certain other chain that is testing a \"Nashville hot\" product, Henderson stood his ground. KFC launches Nashville hot chicken in Pittsburgh \n\"We wish them well,\" then adding for good spicy measure, \"I haven't seen any other national chains do the 'Nashville hot' as well as I think we have. We have a real, authentic homage to the hometown cuisine. Living here in Nashville and being a Nashville company, I think it gives us the hometown advantage.\" \nHello, Colonel? I do believe that's a gauntlet at your feet. \nI have yet to try KFC's version, but I did make my way to the Captain D's on Highway 70. Inside at the counter, Jaylinn Williams said it had been, \"Flying out the door,\" which is funny, since it's fish, not chicken. \nFirst, let me clear one thing up. This is fish that is inspired by Nashville hot chicken. It is most definitely not the classic Nashville hot fish sandwich that I just wrote about , as in the authentic and somewhat official sandwich of North Nashville. Buy Photo \nCaptain D's new Nashville-style hot fish meal includes a spice-dusted fried whitefish filet. (Photo: Jim Myers / The Tennessean) \nWhat it is, is a large, cornmeal-crusted filet of whitefish, dusted with a hot spice blend on top and served with dill pickle slices atop a toasted long bun. It has a healthy kick that measures somewhere south of Prince's mild or Hattie B's medium. Frankly, it's hotter than I would expect from a fast food chain, has a pretty rounded flavor with a hint of sweetness. \nThe overall heat may depend largely on how heavy a hand the person tasked with shaking the spice has. Also, the spice doesn't encapsulate the filet, it's only on top and a little on the bread. Carla Hall rekindles love for Nashville's classic hot fish \nWill it convert the hot chicken acolytes? I don't think so, but it's an addition that may draw some local newbies closer to the established altars of the burning tongue, even if it's more about getting people into a Captain D's. \nAnd then Jason Henderson says the words we never even thought about 10 years ago. \"As 'Nashville hot' becomes more of a national flavor, I think it does us all well.\" \nLook at that, honey. We're not just an it city. Now we're a national flavor. \nI guess it takes two fast food chains for that to happen. At least one of them is local. \nReach Jim Myers at 615-259-8367 and on Twitter @ReadJimMyers. 106 CONNECT 12 TWEET LINKEDIN 3 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1LPQyId MORE STORIES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:29:50.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
