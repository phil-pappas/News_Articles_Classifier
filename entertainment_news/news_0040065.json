Comment Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 5:13 PM By TV Guide Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 5:13 PM John Stamos has been officially charged with one count of driving under the influence in relation to his arrest in June, TMZ reports. Sources tell TMZ that officials found GHB (aka the date rape drug) and another non-narcotic in Stamos' system. On June 12, the Grandfathered and Fuller House star was arrested in Beverly Hills, Calif., after several witnesses reported that he was driving recklessly. Less than a month later, Stamos checked himself into rehab . As a first-time offender, Stamos, 51, will likely get probation in the case; however, the charge carries a maximum jail sentence of six months.
