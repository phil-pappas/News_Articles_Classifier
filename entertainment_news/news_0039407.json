With a print newspaper, of course ‚Äî specifically, with the same Oct. 22, 2015, edition of USA TODAY that Marty McFly picked up in the 1989 film Back to the Future Part II. Fans flocked to newsstands to grab a copy of Thursday's nostalgia-laden USA TODAY, which is wrapped in a prop replica of the paper featured in the time-travel movie starring Michael J. Fox.\nFrom the Cubs sweeping the World Series (so close, yet so far), to a study on cholesterol curing cancer (hello, Paleo ... kind of) to a review of Jaws 19 (is Sharknado really that different?!), fans reveled in this alternate ‚Äî but shockingly believable ‚Äî reality of 2015.\nThe USA TODAY- Back to the Future mashup was noted by the Today show , Entertainment Weekly , Mashable and Quartz , among other media outlets. USA TODAY remained a trending topic on Facebook and Twitter throughout the day. To put it lightly, people were stoked.\nGreat Scott!

Readers also flocked to eBay to secure their copies, where throughout Thursday bidders were lucky to get a copy for $20 , ten times the paper's usual price.\nOnce newspapers sold out, fans flocked to Ebay for a copy of the special USA TODAY.
