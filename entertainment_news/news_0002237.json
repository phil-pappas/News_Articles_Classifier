The possibility that Jeffrey Newland took his own life is now being given \"serious consideration\" by the Monroe County Sheriff's Office, according to the office spokesman, Cpl. John Helfer.\nNewland, who was working to create mentoring businesses, was found dead face-down in a Pittsford cornfield. No gun was found, leading to the conclusion that he'd been killed by someone else.\nBut a continued investigation into the death, along with a review of the case by the FBI Behavioral Sciences unit, now leads investigators to think Newland may have killed himself.\nThe FBI findings, coupled with information from the local investigation, showed a death \"consistent\" with suicide, Helfer said.\nUnder either scenario — homicide or suicide — someone committed a crime, whether killing Newland or leaving the cornfield with the gun he used to kill himself.\n\"There's a missing weapon still,\" Helfer said.\nJeffrey Newland previously served as the executive director of Big Brothers Big Sisters. In 2009, he went to Lifespan of Greater Rochester to run a program that paired older people with city high school efforts, an attempt to boost City School District graduation rates.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nJeffrey Newland 'loved being around people'\nThat program was grant-funded, and, when the grant expired, Newland was without work.\nA popular adviser to others, Newland, 49, then founded Rochester Mentors, a coalition that promoted mentoring programs. He also was trying to craft a model to help businesses decide how they could best have an impact on their communities through collaborations with nonprofits.\nThe car left behind by Jeffrey Newland (Photo: Provided photo)\nOn Oct. 21, 2013, Newland left his home early in the morning, telling his family that he had a series of appointments. When he did not return that evening, his wife, Lori Newland, and a son went looking for him.\nLori Newland and her son, Cooper, drove their normal route to the Jewish Community Center, where they had expected Jeffrey to start his day. Around 7 p.m., Cooper and Lori found Jeffrey's car — a gray Mazda sedan — on Golf Avenue on a shoulder next to the cornfield.\nA jack was wedged underneath the car and a spare tire sat on the grass. No tires were flat, however. Finding nothing unusual inside the car, the Newlands called 911.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nDeath of Jeffrey Newland ruled a homicide\nThe next morning, police and firefighters found Newland's body in the field, about 200 yards from the car. Without a gun, homicide was the natural conclusion for Monroe County Sheriff's Office investigators.\nNow, nearly two years later, investigators suspect that Newland may have instead taken his own life. He had a shotgun, which is missing from his home, Helfer said.\nThe Medical Examiner's Office has been unable to determine what kind of firearm caused his death, Helfer said.\nA $25,000 reward is offered through Crime Stoppers for information that helps solve the crime. Lori Newland said either scenario — homicide or suicide — involves a criminal act by someone.\n\"Bottom line, someone knows something,\" she said. \"Someone was involved, whether someone aided him, didn't come to his aid, or harmed him.\"\nGCRAIG@Gannett.com", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4c52b2d74a715bf1c340f7839fd8f59b56ff5d74/c=0-37-300-263&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/14/Rochester/Rochester/635804180788652306-Newlandcar.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c74f98883a3fb07814a8f86bf4bd58aeefea037f/c=379-0-2731-2348/local/-/media/Rochester/USATODAY/2013/10/25/1382697699000-pitthomicide.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c711c85d58e411988f13438d0dec93db9715f141/r=400x400/local/-/media/2015/10/14/Rochester/Rochester/635804180788652306-Newlandcar.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2a3755d4a5097d38e6417b2bbcb9befd66d8c51b/c=0-938-2448-2317&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Rochester/Rochester/2013/10/24/1382638353000-Jeffrey-Newland.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/14/Rochester/Rochester/635804180788652306-Newlandcar.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-15T18:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:11:11.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
