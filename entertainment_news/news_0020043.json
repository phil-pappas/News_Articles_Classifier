After debuting in the new Fox series Scream Queens as preppy Boone Clemens, tonight, he returns for a second season of his DirecTV series Kingdom , in which he plays mixed martial artist Nate Kulina. Nick says he's excited to continue Nate's \"complicated journey\" this season. \nWhen we last saw Nate, he'd been kicked out of a gay bar for being drunk, and then hooked up with a guy in an alley, confirming what had been hinted at all season: that Nate's gay, or at least bisexual. \n\"With the character, you know, I think my goal was to just see him be true to himself,\" he says of the struggle Nate is now facing, being part of the ultra-macho world of MMA. \"You know, he’s got a really complicated journey and I think it’s got a lot of twists and turns, and I’m willing to go on that journey.\" \n\"It is incredible to go back and have a second season of a TV show, you know,\" he adds, telling ABC Radio. \"It’s amazing to have one, and to get two is really great.\" \nNick says appearing in Kingdom has the added benefit of requiring him to remain completely ripped for months at a time, so he's believable as a butt-kicking mixed martial artist. \n\"That is an element,\" he laughs. \"It is nice to know that every year I’ll kind of have a season where I need to really kick it in!\" \nAs for his day job, Nick just received an American Music Award nomination as Favorite Male Artist. \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
