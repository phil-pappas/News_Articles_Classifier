(Photo: Jamal Samuel)\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE This week in On the Verge, USA TODAY's spotlight on breakthrough artists, Patrick Ryan talks to brother duo R. City .\nLocking in Levine. For years, they've penned hits for the likes of Miley Cyrus, Rihanna and Usher, but now R. City has a smash of their own. The brother duo of Timothy and Theron Thomas currently tops USA TODAY's Top 40 airplay chart with Locked Away , which has sold 862,000 downloads to date, according to Nielsen Music. The reggae-flavored pop song is the lead single off their debut album, What Dreams Are Made Of , released earlier this month, and features Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine. Originally recorded with their vocals on the chorus, Locked was brought to Levine by mega-producer Dr. Luke and \"he really loved the song,\" Timothy, 32, says. \"Getting Adam Levine was like icing on the cake.\"\nBorn to Rock. As kids, the Thomas brothers started as backup dancers for a female hip-hop group in their native St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, before they picked up the mics for themselves as singers and rappers. Moving to Miami after high school, and then to Atlanta to pursue music careers, they started performing at local talent shows to win money and pay the bills. They've gone by R. City (short for Rock City, St. Thomas' nickname) since 2004 and hit their big break two years later.\nMaking it Rain . While in Atlanta, they were introduced to producer Benny-D, who was working with rapper Akon on his new album, 2006's Konvicted . At the time, R. City was reworking a song for themselves that they had written in seventh grade, which Benny thought would be a good fit for Akon. After listening to and loving the track, The Rain , Akon recorded it and R. City was paid $5,000. Before then, \"we used to think artists would write their own music,\" Theron, 33, says. \"We were like, 'Hold up, people get paid $5,000 to write songs? To hell with doing talent shows, we need to be writing.' \"\nCan't Stop collaborating. Since then, the brothers have co-written and produced songs for Beyonc√© ( Bow Down/I Been On ), Justin Bieber ( Runaway Love ) and Nicki Minaj ( Only ). Some of their most memorable collaborators include Rihanna ( Pour It Up ), because of their shared Caribbean connection, Theron says, as well as Cyrus ( We Can't Stop ). Working with the pop provocateur, \"she's just a ball of energy and a really down-to-Earth person,\" Theron says. \"When we did We Can't Stop , she was like, 'Man, I swear this song is literally my life right now. I was at a party a week ago and everything that's explained in this song is what I experienced at that party.' \"\nGetting personal. On Locked 's cool, dancehall chorus, Levine croons, \"If I got locked away / and we lost it all today / tell me honestly / would you still love me the same?\" It's a sentiment inspired by the Thomas' parents, who have been together for more than three decades and stayed committed while their father was incarcerated for five years for grand larceny. \"We just felt if we could tell that story in a cool way, it could be very relatable to people who didn't necessarily experience their loved ones being locked up, but maybe experienced loved ones going off to the military or away for a while,\" Timothy says. \"It's like, 'Will you wait for me? Will you still love me while I'm gone?' \"\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1RPKssi TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b0bb6c1539f8c0825fe3e118305a04e9e5d1e805/c=0-113-1865-2599&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/635802439835439060-R.-City-Press-image-2-large.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1RPKssi", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b2e9b23cd767d8a10443c055f0220c24d0200e88/r=266x400/local/-/media/2015/10/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/635802439835439060-R.-City-Press-image-2-large.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RPKssi&mini=true", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RPKssi&text=On%20the%20Verge%3A%20R.%20City&via=usatoday", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/6GUm5g8SG4o?feature=oembed", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/635802439835439060-R.-City-Press-image-2-large.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-18T18:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T17:49:57.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
