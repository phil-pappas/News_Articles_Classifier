And there's no fourth wall. We're all in this space, together,\" Peters says. \"I know I'm going to entertain the room and have an experience we're all going to enjoy. It can be funny, it can be dramatic. All of those things. And hopefully, everyone will come away feeling satisfied.\" \nThe three-time Tony winner and seven-time nominee will be performing songs from such shows as \"Gypsy,\" \"Sunday in the Park With George,\" \"A Little Night Music\" and \"Into the Woods,\" to name a few. But not everything is a show tune. Just when you least expect it, she will surprise you with something like Peggy Lee's torchy classic, \"Fever.\" Needless to say, it's all pretty theatrical, whether it's from a Broadway show or not. \n\"I pick songs I love. 'No One Is Alone,' 'Children Will Listen.' With 'Send in the Clowns,' I had decided never to do that song again in concert because it was just so perfect for the scene in 'A Little Night Music.' That's how Stephen Sondheim writes. But then I was at this event for (longtime Sondheim director) Hal Prince and Stephen, and I just had to sing it … And I kind of realized it was OK … I think you have to just make it in that moment and that's the most important thing.\" \nPeters has been in some pretty athletic roles for long runs (a year or more). How does one get through the rigors of doing a show eight times a week, for a year or more, especially ones with the vocal demands of, say, \"Gypsy\"? \n\"You have to make sure that it's something that you want to keep doing and keep growing and growing and growing and immerse yourself in. That's what I do love. And I really don't like to distract myself. I don't read books when I'm in a show. I just keep trying to figure it out, and figure it out.\" \nHer most challenging role? \"They were all pretty challenging. With 'Song and Dance,' I had the whole first act to myself, which was especially challenging,\" she says of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, with a first act whose story is told entirely in song (with Peters). \"I really learned how to sing that year. Every day, I would take a singing lesson. Every night, I would blow out my voice from the drama of it all, but I did actually learn how to sing that year.\" \nOther notable roles came in \"Dames at Sea,\" \"George M!\" and \"Mack and Mabel.\" On the big screen, Peters has starred in \"Pennies From Heaven,\" \"The Jerk,\" \"Silent Movie,\" \"Annie\" and \"Pink Cadillac.\" \nPeters is filming her second season of Amazon Prime's original series \"Mozart in the Jungle.\" \nThe series was inspired by \"Mozart in the Jungle: Sex, Drugs and Classical Music,\" oboist Blair Tindall's 2005 memoir of her professional career in New York, playing various high-profile gigs with ensembles including the New York Philharmonic and the orchestras of numerous Broadway shows. The series stars Gael García Bernal as Rodrigo, a character based on conductor Gustavo Dudamel, as well as Malcolm McDowell, Saffron Burrows and Peters. \nA passionate animals advocate, Peters co-created Broadway Barks with Mary Tyler Moore in 1999. The annual free, star-studded dog-and-cat adoption event benefits New York City animal shelters and rescue groups. Produced by Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, it takes place the second Saturday in July in Shubert Alley, with festivities and celebrity presentations of pets for adoption. \nBetween all that, and doing the occasional one-night concert stand (\"I hate to tour,\" she says), she admits it can get a little bit harrowing. But she's an old pro at juggling gigs, at this point. \n\"I have learned to compartmentalize,\" she says.
