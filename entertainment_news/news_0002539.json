Recently, the storm had been shrinking at a faster-than-usual rate, but the latest change is consistent with the long-term trend.\nThe Great Red Spot remains more orange than red these days, and its core, which typically has more intense colour, is less distinct than it used to be.\nAn unusual wispy filament is seen, spanning almost the entire width of the vortex.\nThis filamentary streamer rotates and twists throughout the 10-hour span of the Great Red Spot image sequence, getting distorted by winds blowing at 150 meters per second or even greater speeds.\nIn Jupiter’s North Equatorial Belt, the researchers found an elusive wave that had been spotted on the planet only once before, decades earlier, by Voyager 2.\nIn those images, the wave is barely visible, and nothing like it was seen again, until the current wave was found travelling at about 16 degrees north latitude, in a region dotted with cyclones and anticyclones.\nSimilar waves u2013 called baroclinic waves u2013 sometimes appear in Earth’s atmosphere where cyclones are forming.\n“Until now, we thought the wave seen by Voyager 2 might have been a fluke. As it turns out, it’s just rare!” said co-author Glenn Orton of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\nThe findings are published in the Astrophysical Journal.\n 14, 2015 8:05 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T04:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:19:56.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
