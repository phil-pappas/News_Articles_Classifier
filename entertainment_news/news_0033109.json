From shows like Chopped and Iron Chef to tasting tables in restaurants across the land and even on cruise ships, exhibition has become a hard and fast fixture in the modern dining scene.\nIn Manhattan, Executive Chef Shane Lyons of Distilled NY now invites up to four diners at a single seating on select evenings to hold court at his personal table, which overlooks the kitchen. Reservations for the program, dubbed \"Chef's Counter\" are taken on a first-come, first-served basis, and there will be only one seating per evening. Depending on what's available at the market that day, diners may graze on bespoke creations or the restaurant's signature dishes, but they'll do it in an interactive forum where they're free to discuss and ask questions of the chefs working on their meals. Unlike a traditional tasting menu, the portions are crafted with \"eating\" in mind, rather than \"tasting\" so diners won't be leaving the Chef's Counter hungry.\nThe Chef's Counter will be available in roughly month-long series, each focusing on a different purveyor. The current series, which launched Thursday and will be available through November 21, features Anglesey sea salts from the Welsh harvester Halen Môn .\n\"The Chef's Counter is all about our guests experiencing a fun and intimate interaction with me and the kitchen staff,\" said Chef Lyons. \"We're really fortunate to be partnering with Halen Môn for the very first series. I'm excited to show diners how their hand harvested sea salts can elevate different dishes.\"\nThe damage is $90 per person plus tax and gratuity; the full bar is available and charged on consumption.
