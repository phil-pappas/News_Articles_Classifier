Chris Evans and The Stig (Yui Mok/PA) \n“And also, the second you wander off into the ‘Well, I’m the main host, and this is my mate over here and my mate over here,’ if there’s three of you and you go and make a film together, suddenly you’re doing what they did. Why would you do that? \n“Because they were brilliant at it, I’m not going to do that. So, one thing is for sure, there’s not going to be me and one guy there, and one guy there, that’s not going to happen.” \nHe added at the annual trade show MIPCOM (International Market of Communications Programmes) in Cannes: “They’re the Three Stooges, they are the Bee Gees, they are that and I’m not, I’m me. I’m a solo artist at the moment, I’m on my own, so do I form a band or not?” Promoted stories \nEarlier this year, Evans called on Top Gear fans to send in short audition clips, with the aim of finding presenters to join him. “We’ve screen tested some people from the videos at the Top Gear studio so some people who sent those videos in have reached the final stages,” he revealed. Chris Evans in Cannes (Yui Mok/PA) \nAs a fan of the show through the years, he reckons he’s seen “85-90 per cent” of Top Gear episodes. \nHe said while watching the shows he realised the format was four links and three VTs, but was adamant: “We’re going to change that. I can’t tell you into what, I know, by the way, but I can’t say at the moment. We are going to keep some things that I like, and my kids like, and my friends like, and that I liked anyway, but we are not going to throw the baby out with the bath water.” \nEvans was also reunited with The Stig, who joined him for a photo shoot along the Boulevard de la Croisette. \n“I don’t want to say anything specific, but The Stig is here today… that might be a clue as to whether he’s here tomorrow.” Chris Evans talks to the Press Association (Yui Mok/PA) \nThe BBC Radio 2 presenter has signed a three-year contract for the new series of Top Gear, and there will be two series of the show, each consisting of eight episodes, with the first airing in May 2016. \nHe admitted taking over the show was “formidable”, adding: “It’s the biggest job I’ve ever had in my life.” \nWhen asked if he’s terrified, he said: “Of course, I still am terrified, you have to be, and if you’re not then you’re not the right person for the job.” Share article \nEvans said he’s still on good terms with May and Hammond, and despite not speaking to Clarkson since two weeks after he was announced as the new host, he said he hopes to speak to him soon.
