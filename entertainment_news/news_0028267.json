A scenic 6-hour drive straight north of Toronto. Located on a good all-weather road. Farms are all around. 8 miles from the town of Earlton, between New Liskeard and Englehart. Good fertile soil 40 acres cleared at road, gets 42 big round bales and 3,000 square bales of hay. Oats harvest gets approximately 160 bushels/acre from that same field. A small river with fish running through it. Chubs, Suckers, Pickerel, occasionally sturgeon. Some bush/lumber: white & black spruce; aspen & black poplar Mineral rights. There are gold and diamond mines in the area. There is no liveable house on the property. Drilled well 250 ft deep. The original barn had burnt, a new barn 26' x 48' was built in 2001 on the same site. There are open concept stalls now. There once were standing stalls,. probably dairy-type cattle stalls. Could shift them into long stalls (horse tie-up stalls) by moving manger. It would be perfect for sheep or goats or rabbits. Truckloads of gravel brought in to build a good driveway.Field leveled - ravine filled in Right now there is only one 40-acre field under cultivation. It is seeded to registered oats. (2007). There is another field in the back that was in cultivation in the past. It needs re-ploughing. It was ploughed in the wrong direction & then left, not cultivated down. A good set of disks would chop it down, but there are tag alders and willows coming up in the dead furrows. It is good black soil. It ranges from semi-light to quite heavy. It is capable of growing any crops that a person would want to grow on it. Any crops that anybody is growing in the area would thrive on it. The neighbour is working the land on a share-crop basis. Sellers will not hold mortgage. Property taxes $2,109. Asking price $200,000. Andrew Sobczak On Georgian Bay Real Estate Inc.
