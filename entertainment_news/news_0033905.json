The characters whom you are able to pick at the start of the game consist of the fierce Vice Commander of the Shinsengumi, Toshizo Hijikata , the Commander of the Shinsengumi's 3rd Unit, Hajime Saito , and a hero of the Choshu clan who is on the run from the Shinsengumi, named Kogoro Katsura. In order to match the tastes of the North American target, the first three available character routes have been changed from the Japanese edition.\nAs a result of the player's actions, the story can change substantially leading to a situation where the heroine either falls in love with one of the characters or is loved by one of them.\nCYBIRD plans to continue to actively develop high-quality services with the aim of becoming the number-one provider of romance games for women worldwide.\n- Outline of \"Destined to Love: Ikemen Samurai Romances\"\n-- Story\nIn Japan , the dawn of a new era was approaching. You find yourself suddenly snatched from your peaceful life in modern days to a different time, and a landscape you've never seen.
