Dwayne Johnson stars as a heroic helicopter pilot. Contains cataclysmic destruction and some crude language. Extras include commentary by director Brad Peyton, \"San Andreas: The Real Fault Line,\" \"Dwayne Johnson to the Rescue,\" \"Scoring the Quake,\" deleted scenes, gag reel and stunt reel.\n\"Dope\" (R, 103 minutes, Universal): An exuberant coming-of-age comedy that beguiled audiences at the Sundance Film Festival, \"Dope\" engages the issues of race, identity and authenticity currently aswirl in the culture.
