She will be composing for an untitled film that will be directed by debutant Kevin, who has assisted directors Gautham Menon and Kathir.\nPrashanthini, who is a singer herself and has sung chartbusters like Mundhinam Parthene and Ennamo Yedho, says, \"I have been doing jingles for some time and that's how the makers had come to know of my work. They approached me and heard some of the songs I had composed independently. They liked the songs very much as the sounding and the tunes were trendy.\"\nThe film, she says, is an out-and-out love story, set against the backdrop of Ooty. \"So, the songs are going to be soft melodies. I have already finished composing three songs, which we will be recording in the coming days. The album will have five songs in total and a theme track as well,\" she says and adds that the film will likely have new faces in the lead to add to the freshness of the romantic story.\nThe singer is also in talks to compose for another film, which will star a top hero.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:26:54.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
