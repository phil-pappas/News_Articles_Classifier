Chanel Oberlin (Emma Roberts) is the main character and the president of the sorority. The first episode begins with a party at Kappa Kappa Tai 20 years ago when a horrifying incident occurs and sets the stage for the rest of the episode. A serial killer wearing a red devil costume targets the sorority, resulting in a race to find the murderer. More and more traumatizing deaths help build suspense and keep the audience guessing. “Scream Queens” combines the old-fashioned “whodunnit” style with funny, sassy, typical teen moments. This show will leave you laughing until your side hurts one minute and sitting on the edge of your seat the next. Sometimes the horror can even be spoof-like which can lighten the mood or give the watchers the chills. Chanel is the perfect main character because of her witty comebacks, emotional moments, and accidental psychopathic scenes. Jamie Lee Curtis plays Cathy Munsch, the flirtatious and hard to read dean at the university, who is determined to shut down Chanel and Kappa Kappa Tai. Other amazing characters include Nick Jonas as Boone Clemens, Lea Michele as Hester Ulrich, Skyler Samuels as Grace Gardner, Abigail Breslin as Chanel No. 5 and many more cameos. Each character is so unique and adds immensely to both the horror and comedy aspects in the show. This is definitely a show that lends itself to great quotes, with almost every character spouting a funny and memorable line every second. It's definitely a must watch if you love horror, comedy, and great acting all rolled up in one to-die-for experience. “Scream Queens” shows at 8/9 central Tuesdays on Fox. — Leah Arisman is a junior at Sacred Heart-Griffin High School. ***", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T07:18:00.556+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
