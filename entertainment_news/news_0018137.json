Did you catch it? Or, like the ultimate point of the whole series, did you miss it?\nClick through the slideshow to check out his background in film and television.\nCuse visited the Orange County Register offices Tuesday to support his boyhood friend, author Peter Heller. Heller was the guest of the Orange County Register Book Club, and his memoir “Kook” was the focus of the event.\n“We both had the dream of being writers,” said Cuse, who now lives in Los Angeles. “And look what happened.”\nCuse, listed as one of the most influential people in the world in Time Magazine in 2010, was the “Lost” showrunner and is in charge of three current television series: “Bates Motel,” “The Strain” and “Colony.” He lived in Tustin during his youth, attending Hewes Middle School and Foothill High School before his parents sent him to boarding school in Vermont.\nHe remembers his summers vividly, when he worked for a yacht broker in Newport Beach. He swabbed decks and cleaned barnacles off the hulls of grand ships, then, in his free time, he tooled around Newport Harbor in a Hobie Cat.\n“My fondest memory is sailing in Newport,” he said. Then he paused; he also loved La Chiquita Restaurant in Santa Ana. But sailing just a bit more.\nThe Orange County he remembers was an agricultural grid, where he found open dirt to race his 1969 Oldsmobile 442.\n“We were pretty fast,” he said with a smile.\nDisneyland in the 1960s and ‘70s captured his imagination. He remembers riding bumper cars on air. He remembers the thrill of the Pirates of the Caribbean, which transported riders down waterfalls and through ocean battles in the middle of Anaheim.\n“Disneyland was a huge factor in connecting me to the theater business,” he said. “All those rides were formative.”\nAfter his parents’ divorce, they sent him to school in Vermont. Eventually, he went to Harvard where he became infatuated with movies. During his junior year in college, Cuse organized a screening of the movie “Airplane!” on the Harvard campus. He got to meet the filmmakers, and he wanted to make Hollywood his future.\nIn college, Cuse was on the rowing team, and he helped make a documentary film “Power Ten” about the team’s exploits. He convinced writer George Plimpton to narrate the film. After college, he moved back to Southern California and worked as a script reader.\n1 2 3 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:33:38.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
