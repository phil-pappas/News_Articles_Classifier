The next shot shows his TIE fighter shot to pieces and careening to presumably the same planet. \n\"Nothing will stand in our way,\" Adam Driver's helmeted Kylo Ren vows to the heat-melted helmet of Darth Vader. \"I will finish what you started.\" His character is said to be a member of a group of the Knights of Ren, who were said to emulate the Sith. He's shown apparently using a Force grip of some type to apparently torture Oscar Isaac's resistance pilot Poe Dameron. \n\"There are stories about what happened,\" Ridley says to Harrison Ford's Han Solo, off-camera, as his Millennium Falcon dogfights with TIE fighters amid starship ruins on Jakku. \"It's true,\" he responded. \"All of it. The Dark Side. The Jedi. They're real.\" As his voiceover continues, teases of massive land and aerial battles rage on various planets. \nDameron and Finn share a quick back-slap as they scramble to Resistance X-Wings. Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia tenderly hugs Solo. And finally, Finn ignites Luke Skywalker's blue lightsaber and faces off against the jagged crimson blade of Kylo Ren's. \n\"The Force. It's calling to you,\" the same female voice heard earlier urges. \"Just let it in.\" \nStar Wars: The Force Awakens , also starring Mark Hamill and Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o, hits theaters December 18. \nThe movie was produced by Lucasfilm, which, like ABC News, is owned by Disney. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
