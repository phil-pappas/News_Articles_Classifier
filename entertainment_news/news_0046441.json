Image 13 of 13 ‘99 Homes’ a gripping tale from the foreclosure front lines 1 / 13 Back to Gallery 99 Homes,” a gripping, intelligent thriller set amid the bursting of the nation’s housing bubble, zeroes in on the ruination of the American dream and the morally bankrupt characters who profited from the carnage. Like “The Grapes of Wrath,” it’s a classic example of how to take a social issue and turn it into riveting cinema.\nThe story opens in an Orlando bathroom, where a family man has just killed himself to avoid the specter of being thrown out of his foreclosed home. Not long after the yellow police tape has been set up, real estate broker Rick Carver (the incomparable Michael Shannon ) is prowling the premises, with an e-cigarette in his mouth, a cellphone in his ear, and a gun attached to his ankle. Carver needs to make sure that the dead man’s grieving wife and kids are shooed off the grounds so he can keep his banker clients happy.\nMore Information 99 Homes\n★★★★\nQuick take: How to profit from the demise of the America dream\nThen it’s off to another residence, where Carver’s next victim awaits: down-on-his-luck construction worker Dennis Nash ( Andrew Garfield , back in top form after his “Spider-Man” foray), his mother (the always reliable Laura Dern ) and his son. It’s the first of many evictions in this movie, and director Ramin Bahraini imbues all of them with a palpable sense of terror, anguish and heartbreak.\nAs it turns out, Carver sees a lot of leadership potential in the handyman Nash, who ends up striking a Faustian deal in which he helps the ruthless broker with evictions in exchange for financial help. Because of Garfield’s skill, and the strength of the script, we sympathize with the desperate Nash and his love for his home, even as he forecloses on his moral values.\nLikewise, Shannon provides interesting shadings to Carver. On the surface, he’s Gordon Gecko with a “Miami Vice” outfit, but it’s clear that Carver doesn’t enjoy what he’s doing or view it as a way to simply get rich. Instead, he sees himself as a player trying to survive in a game that’s been rigged against 99 percent of the population. Shannon manages to convey an inner loneliness, a quiet desperation that he’s gone too far but can’t turn back.\nThe climactic scene bristles with tension, though some may find themselves wanting more of a confrontation between Nash and Carver. Bahraini, however, more than makes up for this with an indelible final image that is surprising, ambiguous, and fitting for this film. All in all, a highly entertaining and provocative movie.\nRunning time: 112 minutes\nMPAA rating: R (profanity, violence)", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/65/8756598/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/65/8756595/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/65/8756593/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/65/8756597/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/65/8756594/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/65/8756597/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/65/8756600/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/65/8756602/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/65/8756590/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/65/8756596/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/65/8756598/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/65/8756592/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/65/8756591/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/65/8756595/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/65/8756601/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/65/8756590/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/65/8756591/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/65/8756602/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/65/8756600/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/65/8756592/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/65/8756596/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/65/8756601/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/65/8756594/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/65/8756593/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T14:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:35:25.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
