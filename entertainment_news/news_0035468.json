Husband, Edgar (DAVID RICHMOND-PECK “Pacific Rim”), finds himself condemned to a special place in hell, blamed for her murder – a fact he refuses to accept. His punishment is to eternally re-live that last dreadful day. Learning that his only escape is through enlightenment, he enlists the help of fellow inmates and devises a plan to end this horrific cycle.\n\"Darkness on the Edge of Town,\" set in Ireland’s bleak rural South, introduces troubled teenage sharpshooter Cleo Callahan (EMMA ELIZA REGAN “Get Up and Go”) seeking to avenge the death of her sister who was found brutally stabbed to death. Blinded by rage, Cleo is unaware that her best and only friend, Robin O’Riley (EMMA WILLIS \"The Christening\"), is the murderer she’s sworn to kill. As Robin’s damaged brother Virgil (BRIAN GLEESON “Snow White and the Huntsman\") also draws closer to the truth, the three become tragically entangled, leading to an inevitable bloody showdown.\nView “Cruel & Unusual” Trailer here.\nView “Darkness on the Edge of Town” Trailer here.\nScreeners for both films are available for review.\nFilmmakers and cast are available for interviews.\nAbout Candy Factory Films\nCandy Factory Films is dedicated to producing and distributing high impact films and fostering communities around independent cinema.
