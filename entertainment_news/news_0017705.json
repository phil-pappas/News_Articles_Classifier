Business journalist Bruce Sellery will host her show for the next two weeks.\nLang's tenure in recent months was tainted by allegations of impropriety, although a CBC review concluded she abided by journalistic standards.\nIn early January, media website Canadaland alleged that she tried to \"sabotage\" a 2013 story about the Royal Bank of Canada and its use of temporary foreign workers.\nThe report said the bank sponsored some speeches or events at which Lang spoke and that Lang had a \"serious relationship\" with a bank board member. Lang said she disclosed the relationship to the CBC.\nThe CBC came to Lang's defence and said her paid speaking appearances were approved and did not violate any rules. However, in late January, the CBC said it would no longer approve any paid appearances by its on-air journalistic employees.\nThen in March, the CBC said after a review it had concluded that Lang abided by journalistic standards during her involvement with that 2013 story.\nLang previously worked for various newspapers, including the Globe and Mail and the National Post, and anchored with CNN in New York and the Business News Network.\nLang and McGuire were not immediately available for comment.\nRelated Stories Amanda Lang allegations 'categorically untrue,' CBC exec says", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:38:19.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
