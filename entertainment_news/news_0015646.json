Photo: act\\ron.cerabona \nAntarctica by Tony Fleming. PhotoACTIVISM: PhotoAccess members' exhibition. Huw Davies Gallery. PhotoAccess at the Manuka Arts Centre. Corner of Manuka Circle and NSW Circle, Griffith. Until October 18. \nAntarctica  is Tony Fleming's first solo exhibition and an impressive debut it is. Fleming was the Director of the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) from 2011 to August 2015. Prior to his work with the AAD Fleming held a number of key positions in areas related to the environment, wildlife and conservation. The 21 works in Antarctica  are a personal paean to the remote Aurora Basin North where he worked in the summer of 2013-2014. A number of the works (all inkjet prints) reveal the infinite vastness of the Antarctic landscape. Aurora Basin North scientific camp from the air  is an extraordinarily compelling image. It is essentially a \"white\" rectangle (25.7 x 38.0cm) whose \"whiteness\" is broken by the black specks of human activity. Its minimalist simplicity and visually dramatic starkness evoke the abstract sublimity of Mark Rothko's quaveringly embracing forms or further back historically, the works of Turner and others of the 18th and 19th century Romantic Sublime. Humanity is barely there in this spare and uniquely beautiful topography. Other images – Franklin Island, Ross Sea , T abular iceberg  and Looking from Wilkes Station  for example – continue to document through Fleming's special \"eye\" the beauty and power of the immensity of nature as configured in the Antarctic continent. Fleming obviously has an intimate (scientific) knowledge of the places depicted. He also approaches his subjects (at least those concerned with the natural world) with an understanding of the aesthetic attraction of the unknown, the exotic, the geographic \"other\" that ineluctably draws his viewers in.\nFleming also includes the scientific activities being carried out by Australia (and others) that contribute to our knowledge of, amongst other things, climate change. These images – Dr Mark Curran holding an ice core , Drilling the 300m core  and Drilling tent  – have a more documentary character than the above. However Fleming's aesthetic manages to instil itself in, for example Doctor walking at Aurora Basin camp . This is a visually interesting composition in which verticals, horizontals and semicircles are combined with the almost silhouetted figure of the \"Doctor\" as he moves through the whites of the landscape that stand in declarative contrast to the blues of the sky. \nTony Fleming, \"Aurora Base Camp\" (2013) in \"Antarctica\" at Photoaccess.\nWhile Fleming's images that include human activity promote an actively positive sense of the purpose of man's place in the Antarctic continent one image in particular proffers an extremely powerful question. Bow of the 'Aurora Australis' Australia's research and resupply icebreaker  is an impressive image. Its initial visual impact is an abstract one with the orange mass of the icebreaker's bow occupying the predominant spatial configuration and pushing forward from the pictorial plane into the viewer's space in an overtly visible and (almost) physical way. The powerful mass of orange stands in (again) focused opposition to the whiteness of the ice and in this opposition offers us a metaphor of the conflict of man and nature. Fleming's overall message is however that man needs the natural world to help us understand where we are, where we have been and where we might be going. Antarctica  provides beautiful images allied with important messages and is an exhibition that is worth visiting. \nAdvertisement While Antarctica  is singularly focused PhotoACTIVISM,  as one would expect from a members' exhibition including 31 artists, is an eclectic and idiosyncratic collection in which according to the accompanying brochure text, exhibited works \"respond to the proposition that photography can both capture and participate in, various forms of activism\". The exhibiting artists have (mostly) embraced a range of \"Activisms\" including racism, sexual politics, environmental politics, animal rights, human rights and individual rights. Each artist also provides a text that elucidates (or not) the \"activism\" he/she is depicting. The addition of the textual could be said to diminish the impact of the images. In many instances it served as apologia for images whose relationship to the professed theme was inchoate or at least obscure. The best work embraced the thematic premise and used the photographic medium in various guises (although inkjet prints seem to be the technology of the moment) to present aesthetically fine and conceptually resolved images. \nA number of works stood out for me. Georgia Black's Instant gratification  was unique in its use of media – viz. screenprint, beeswax, pinpricks on Kozo paper. It is a delicately structured, physically small piece that demands in a quietly seductive manner that the viewer engage with it on an intimate level that will open or at least introduces its layered meanings through that active engagement. Ngaio Fitzpatrick's Anthropocene  is a thematically challenging and aesthetically captivating video that uses disruptive sound and visuals that metaphorically interrogate viewers' notions of their environment. The shattering of sheets of glass in an empty stairwell is particularly captivating compelling.\nAndrew Robert Morgan, \"Deforestation\" (2013) in \"PhotoACTIVISM\" at Photoaccess Photo: act\\ron.cerabona \nA less confronting image but nevertheless very effective image is Glenn Pure's Satin bower bird . It is a (comparatively) large image - 76.0 x 85.0cm – and its scale leads us into its theme. There is an air of poignant vulnerability in the close-up of the beautiful bird that occupies the entirety of the picture plane. Its precarious visual positioning announces the precariousness of its place in its natural environment. The directness of the image aligned with its scale forces direct viewer confrontation, aesthetically and thematically. Andrew Morgan's Deforestation  is another work where compositional strategy underscores thematic message. Here the detailed foreground image of the landscape populated with the detritus of the cleared forest is sharply contrasted with the background image of the bush awaiting the same fate. \nI also enjoyed a number of works whose \"Activist\" credentials were to say the least, loose. Genevieve Swifte\"s Scent , Andrée Lawrey\"s 2 Pirie St  and Brian Stewart's Prayer  were the best of these.\nPhotoACTIVISM  presents a range of works dating from 1988 to 2015 that explores aspects of the richly diverse photographic medium. The range of responses from the documentary to the purely aesthetic to the theme as stated, points to the difficulty of applying such a theme. Nevertheless a theme was applied and its absence in some work was an annoying presence. That said the overall exhibition was worthwhile and its highlights as alluded to above moved it beyond this.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T10:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:06:36.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
