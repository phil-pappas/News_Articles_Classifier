They were inspired by their mother, who died from cancer last year. \nDempsey is best known as Dr. Derek \"McDreamy\" Shepherd on TV's \"Grey's Anatomy,\" but he left the show earlier this year. He's also filming the movie \"Bridget Jones's Baby\" in London. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T15:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T19:50:58.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
