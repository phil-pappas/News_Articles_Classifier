A source told the website, \"They had a dalliance at the end of ' The X Factor ' in 2013 and met up again early last year.\" \"Harry was obviously very taken by Nicole who is stunning and he had always looked up to her,\" the source continued. \"She was a guest judge on 'X Factor' at the time One Direction were formed and has always claimed credit for putting the band together, even though Simon Cowell says it was his idea.\" Though Nicole reportedly had known Harry since 2010, when the band was formed, the two hooked up when he was mature enough. \"But they hooked up over three years later when Harry had matured and was a member of the world's biggest band,\" the source explained. \"Harry was 19 at the time but had an old head on his shoulders because he'd already been in a relationship with Caroline Flack who was 14 years older than him.\" The two openly flirted with each other at the 2014 Brit Awards after-party hosted by Sony. A source at the event said, \"They were openly all over each other at Sony's post-Brits event. They were sitting next to each other, having lots to drink and wildly flirting.\" Regarding their closeness, the source said, \"It was very clear there was an electric chemistry between them and something had gone on. Harry had been linked to Kendall Jenner but that was always pretty casual.\" However, friends of Nicole told the website that the former member of The Pussycat Dolls didn't have any intention to be in a serious relationship with Harry. A friend revealed, \"Yes they did snog and got on well, but they never dated.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:17:35.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
