Titled ’25’, Adele took to social media to explain the new album. “My last record was a break-up record,” writes Adele. “And if I had to label this one I would call it a make-up record. I’m making up with myself. Making up for lost time. Making up for everything I ever did and never did…25 is about getting to know who I’ve become without realising. And I’m sorry it took so long, but you know, life happened.” \nAccording to The Verge, there’s still no single, release date, or tracklist in sight for 25 , but we know a little bit about the producers and writers who helped to make it. Danger Mouse, Max Martin, Tobias Jesso Jr., and Ryan Tedder were all involved in the recording process, and they could all contribute one or more tracks to the final product. \nRead Adele’s full letter below: \nShort URL : http://lgbtweekly.com/?p=65137 Posted by Steve Lee, Editor on Oct 21, 2015.
