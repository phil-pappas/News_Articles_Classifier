Top team ... Sasha and Sam have continued to strengthen their bond since filming.

Love bubble ... The duo are ready to start declaring their love publicity. Picture: Toby Zerna Source: News Corp Australia \nThe duo have managed to catch up most weekends in secret which has seen their relationship continue to strengthen. But until now, only a small selection of people outside of the production crew have been privy to how the show ended. \nMielczarek confided in his parents and a close friend while Frost let her sister Kristine and brothers Steve and Alex know that they’d found love. \nDespite the secrecy though, Frost said one family member came very close to revealing the top secret ending. \n“I thought my niece (two-year-old Bridie) was going to be the spoiler,” she laughed. “She’ll see my face at the supermarket on magazines and point and say, ‘Aunty Sam and Sasha!’ She FaceTimes Sasha all the time, she loves him.” \nMeanwhile, Mielczarek said he faced a different problem when it came to magazine headlines, especially the one which declared he and Frost were expecting a baby together. \n“My Nan rang me up and said, ‘Oh my God Sasha, I am so excited I’m going to be a great grandmother!’ And I was like, ‘Nan, it’s not true.’ She was heartbroken.” \nAs for whether babies are now on the horizon, Frost said there’s no timeline, but if it were up to Mielczarek she’d be “knocked up tomorrow.” Laughter is key ... The couple have laughed off any rumours that arose during the series. Picture: Toby Zerna Source: News Corp Australia \n“We’re just taking normal steps in our relationship,” Mielczarek added. “We’ll do the natural progression, we’ll hang out now, then we’ll move in, then when it comes to it we might even get engaged and see what happens.” \nThe Bachelorette has been a resounding success for Channel 10, having dominated the ratings each Wednesday and Thursday night. \nA second series was officially given a green light by the network today. The Bachelor will also return in 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T13:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T13:49:47.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
