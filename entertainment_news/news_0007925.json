It hasn't been easy, but we kept trying because we can't wait to bring our first child into the world and grow our family. \n\"We're so excited that it's finally happening. Thank you for all your love and well wishes. I look forward to all the belly touching! Xx\" \nTeigen said on the Tyra Banks television show \"FabLife\" not long ago that people often asked when she and her husband of two years were starting a family, unaware that she and Legend were having trouble getting pregnant. \n\"We would have had kids five, six years ago if it had happened,\" she said. \"It's been a process. We've seen fertility doctors.\" \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource . All rights reserved.
