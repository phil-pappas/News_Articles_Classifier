They’re still working on the script,” Reeves said on Wednesday night at the Los Angeles premiere of thriller “Knock Knock”. \n“There’s some new ideas, over the years it’s been getting better and better and hopefully one day we can make that film.” \nIn “Knock Knock” Reeves plays a husband and father who is alone at home for the weekend. A call for help from two stranded women soon turns into something more sinister. \n(Reporting by Reuters Television in Los Angeles; Writing by Marie-Louise Gumuchian in London; Editing by Louise Ireland )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:27:17.760+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
