But minds were well and truly blown when Justin Bieber appeared – and went down the Slip ‘N Slide. (Channel 4/Screenshot) \nYes really, here’s the proof. Yes, @justinbieber did the giant Slip N Slide.No, he didn't beat the record time.No, it doesn't matter. #TFIFriday https://t.co/qistzVutEb \n— Channel 4 (@Channel4) October 23, 2015 Justin bieber doing the slip n slide omg #TFIFriday \n— Lothar Matthäus (@Mclacks_) October 23, 2015 Bieber. Covered in slide lube. #TFIFriday \n— floweroflondon (@floweroflondon) October 23, 2015 \nBut The Biebs in the 90s made the weird generational crossover of the show really obvious. #TFIFriday doesn't work as the people watching the 90s one don't want to see kids and people now don't get the concept of the 90s one… \n— Adam Potter (@finaladam) October 23, 2015 \nEventually everyone who hated the format but loved The Bieber got what they were after, as he performed What Do You Mean? (Channel 4/Screenshot) \n— UK Bieber News (@UK_BieberNews) October 23, 2015 \nWhile 90s kids reacted like this. I'm still not familiar with Justin Beiber's work – I will set aside some time for that just before hell freezes over #TFIFriday \n— Scott Nicoll (@scottnicoll1874) October 23, 2015 It's amazing how music can move you…For example, Justin Bieber is singing on #TFIFriday , so I'm going to go and wash the dishes. \n— Adam Todd (@AdamTodd310389) October 23, 2015 \nHe was probably marginally more popular than Hurts earlier though. #tfifriday can't fault a band that are honest enough to use their name to let you know what their music does to your ears \nBut many still can’t make up their minds about whether TFI Friday should have stayed in the 90s. Is #TFIFriday now just a copy of Smash Hits on tele? I can't tell if #TFIFriday is bad in that kind of adorably intentional way or if it's just just terrible.
