(AP) - An artwork that gallery officials say was created at a former Detroit auto plant by elusive British graffiti artist Banksy has sold at auction for $137,500.\nThe Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News report the piece was sold Wednesday at Julien's Auctions in Beverly Hills, California. An 8-foot, 1,500-pound section of cinderblock wall featuring the artwork was excavated from the Packard Plant site in 2010 by the nonprofit 555 gallery in Detroit.\nThe mural features child holding a bucket of red paint and a brush next to a message that says: \"I remember when all this was trees.\"\nThe 555 gallery will get $110,000 from the sale, and officials plan to use it to renovate the gallery's new permanent home.\nBanksy is known for anonymously leaving his work in public areas.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
