I call this my surplus thinking. Are you anxiously thinking about the future or rehearsing past mistakes? I catch myself doing just that quite often. Then I remind myself that Paul in the Bible told the Philippians, \"Finally brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there be any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.\"\nThen I correct my thinking, because I know from experience that negative thinking solves nothing and, in fact, is destructive to health and well-being. Just think what distortion is going on inside our bodies when our thoughts distort our faces! When we're ruminating, we're not trusting God. We should be spending our moments listening for useful ideas from him. These thoughts are always available, but we hear them only when our thought is calm and receptive.\nSome of you may remember when radios had a dial that you could twist to change the frequency of the signal you were receiving. Usually when you turned on the radio you got a lot of static or garbled noise. But as you turned the dial you could fine-tune the signal to get a clear, perfect broadcast. It is the same with our thinking. There are many thoughts coming to us, but we need to fine-tune our thinking to receive only clear, positive thoughts. We leave the \"static\"— the anxious, upset, discouraged, disturbed thoughts — and tune in to the peaceful, joyous, harmonious, uplifting thoughts. \"Static\" thoughts result in things going wrong, relationships falling apart, even the body being upset. When we tune in to right thoughts we feel strong and energized, our days go well, relationships are strong and healthy, often unexpected good happens.\nLet's examine \"static\" thinking more closely so we can recognize it and tune it out. I find that it often magnifies little wrongs or misinterprets things we've heard. It rehearses uncertainty about family situations or business problems. Once we recognize what \"static\" thinking we have fallen into, we can immediately change the dial of our thinking and tune in to the clear, true signal broadcasting health, peace, joy and trust in God.\nBut, you say, this is just wishful thinking, ignoring \"reality.\" I beg to disagree. There are thousands of documented testimonies, from Bible times until today, of physical, mental and financial healings that have taken place through those who have learned to fine-tune their thinking.\nFor example, I once tripped and fell down a couple of cement steps that had no railing. I was in great pain with knee and back injuries. As I have learned from the Bible and from a book I love, \"Science and Health, With Key to the Scriptures,\" by Mary Baker Eddy, I immediately began to pray, \"I am created by God, good. What God has created can never fall out of his loving care. God, good, is present right here, right now. His laws govern me and protect me. I am never separated from him. I reflect him. Since he is perfect, I am perfect. I cannot be fooled into thinking otherwise.\" I prayed this way for about 15 minutes. Suddenly I realized there was no more pain and I was healed. I have had no trouble from back or knee for the many years since that incident.\nIf I had not been consistently fine-tuning my surplus thinking, I would not have been able to immediately pray with conviction, and would not have been healed at that time of need.\nWhat will you tune in to today? You have a choice right now!\nLinda is a Reader at First Church of Christ, Scientist, 3020 Hamilton Blvd., Allentown, with Reading Room at 86 E.
