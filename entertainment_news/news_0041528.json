When I called my husband to tell him, he sounded scared that I knew about it. When I dug a little deeper, I found out they were child support papers from a woman he’d had an affair with. Nobody likes to be played for a fool, and you wouldn’t be human if you didn’t have these feelings. Ten years ago, while I was still in college, I dated and fell in love with a married man I’ll call “Jon.” The split was messy in the end, but since then we have moved on with our lives — divorce for him, and marriage for me. Do I tell my husband (who knows about the affair) that Jon will be working with me, or keep quiet? Keep the relationship strictly business , for both your sakes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T10:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:56:51.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
