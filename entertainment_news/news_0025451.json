The film is a romantic musical thriller and he says only live instruments have been used for its music.\nTalking about the film, he says, \"Director Ranjit Jeyakodi is a friend of a friend. A top music director was supposed to do the film but Ranjith chose me because he needed a new sound and also the comfort level while working together. I was initially hesitant because people might have doubts if the music in such a genre was going to be scored by a newcomer.\"\nHe says the songs in the film are not formulaic and have been composed to go with the situation in the film. \"There will be an undercurrent of darkness in every song, even if it is a romantic number,\" he adds.\nBut it is the background score of the film that he is most excited about. \"The film will have an orchestral score and we have recorded using only live instruments and ethnic sounds. In addition to The Chennai Strings Orchestra, we have also recorded in Spain with a troupe called Mad For Music. Grammy Award-winner PA Deepak has done the sound mixing and thanks to our producers' support, we have done the mastering in Los Angeles,\" he reveals.\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-17T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:41:06.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
