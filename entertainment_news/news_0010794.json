He did not say whether the sidewalk was uneven. \nThe 91-year-old was treated at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and released. \nPublicist Henri Bollinger told the Associated Press that Barker received stitches for his head injuries but managed to walk on his own out of the hospital. \nThe injury has made Barker feel discouraged, Bollinger said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T06:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T15:38:09.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
