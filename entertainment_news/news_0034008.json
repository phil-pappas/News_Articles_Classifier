Farrah quickly went from being a young mother of one to a porn star. Many of her former co-stars, including Maci Bookout, did not want to be guilty by association and decided to distance herself from the entire Teen Mom franchise. \nFarrah Abraham made several wild decisions during a period where she was trying to find herself. She filmed two films with a famous porn star, and she started getting plastic surgery. One of her most famous surgeries was her botched lip surgery, which was briefly featured on Botched. But this surgery isn’t stopping Farrah from getting more. \nAccording to a new Hollywood Life report, Farrah Abraham is now planning to go in for a third breast augmentation. This particular surgery is being done to fix issues that surfaced during her first two surgeries. Her first two surgeries took her from an A cup to a D cup, but the surgeries did come with some issues. \n“I’m thankful to have the best reconstructive breast surgeon in the Beverly Hills area fix the burning and pain issues that were horrible,” Farrah told The Ashley in an interview, adding, “I was happy to learn about new incision placement for better results as opposed to under the breast for my pain and burning to stop.” \nIt is very interesting that Farrah Abraham is getting a surgery to fix some issues that have surfaced over the past few years. When Farrah filmed Botched, she only came in to fix her lip. She didn’t mention anything about a burning sensation in regards to her previous breast surgery. But Farrah is happy that she can now share her story and hopefully inspire others to get things checked – and fixed. Since Abraham relies on her body to make money, it makes sense she wants it fixed. \n— Farrah Abraham (@F1abraham) October 14, 2015 \n“I’m happy I could share my story to help other women who may have these side effects and now know it is fixable and there are great doctors to fix this issue and better implants like SRX,” she revealed. But just because Farrah Abraham is getting her breasts fixed doesn’t mean she is out of the woods in regards to backlashes. Abraham recently posted a picture of her daughter, who is now headed into the first grade. But fans noticed that Sophia was wearing makeup. \n— Farrah Abraham (@F1abraham) October 19, 2015 \n“#PictureDay #SchoolPictures Sophia is so beautiful! 1st Grade Photos #MomMonday #MakeLifeBetterInAWord Blessed,” Farrah revealed on Twitter, sharing a picture of little Sophia wearing makeup for her school photo, which unleashed quite the backlash. \n“Makeup is NOT for little girls, WTF are you teaching her? She is beautiful,” one Twitter user commented, while two others wrote, “It’s kind of like saying you don’t think your child is that pretty so you’re gonna put makeup on them” and “Why in the world would you put makeup on her? She’s a child. You are going to give her serious lack of self-esteem issues.” \nClearly, many Teen Mom viewers are still under the impression that Farrah is a horrible mother who is teaching Sophia many of the wrong values. Some followers brought up valuable points about self-esteem. Hopefully, Sophia won’t be relying on makeup to feel great about herself and her life. Farrah has previously revealed that she would fully support her daughter if she decided to get plastic surgery, which was a comment that many viewers were concerned about. But Sophia appears happy for now. \nWhat do you think about Farrah Abraham’s decision to undergo yet another surgery? Do you think she is setting a great example for Sophia?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T18:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:56:38.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
