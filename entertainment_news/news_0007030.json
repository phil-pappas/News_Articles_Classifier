The band are four sisters who have grown up singing and dancing together. In their first audition: they performed Jessie J’s Bang Bang How would you describe your own style? We are very fierce, energetic, powerful performers with angelic harmonies. In terms of our fashion style, it is more of a girly teeny-bop look, with lots of colour and a bit of hip hop. What makes you stand out from everyone else in your category? I think the fact that we are sisters makes us stand out and we also perform with a lot of passion, fun and love. We always sing from our hearts. \nAlien Uncovered: formerly Alien Alien Uncovered (ITV Pictures) \nThe band are: Madison (19), Natalie (18), Temple (24), Frank (17), Yaz (23) and Shae (23). They have been together for eighteen months. In their first audition: they performed The Black Eyed Peas’ Pump It Where do you see yourselves in five years time? We want to go international, touring and performing at Madison Square Gardens and Wembley. We want to spread the Alien message across all continents… Describe your mentor in three words? Current, iconic, cool – she could definitely be an Alien! Promoted stories \nBEKLN Mile: formerly BEKLN \nThe band are: Baison (31), Emmanuel (27), Kadeem (22), Lawrence (22) and Nathanael (29).They have been together for six months. In their first audition: they performed James Bay’s Hold Back The River How would you describe your own style? We get lost in the music so we always allow the music to take over and we leave our hearts on stage whenever we perform. We have a lot of energy, and perform with emotion and conviction, and our style represents that. \nMelody Stone: formerly Silver Tone Melody Stone (ITV Pictures) \nThe band are: Keshia (32), Nicole (22), Rachel-Yvonne (31), Wynter (24) and Santhy (26). They have been together for six months. In their first audition: they performed Simon and Garfunkel’s Bridge Over Troubled Water Fantasy dinner party – which five music industry figures dead or alive would you invite? Luther Vandross, Stevie Wonder, Beyonce, Ed Sheeran and Michael Jackson. What would it mean to get to the live shows? It would be great to know Cheryl believed in us and believed that the UK and the rest of the world needs to hear our voices. \nNew Kings Order: formerly The First Kings New Kings Order (ITV Pictures) \nThe band are: Cardan (22), Aaron (25), Calum (23), Josh (21) and Hemz (25). The band have been together since April 2015 In their first audition: the band performed Bruno Mars’ Uptown Funk Describe the toughest point in the competition so far? The Judges’ Houses because Cardan lost his voice, so we really had to pull together. Cardan usually directs everything, so it really tested the rest of us. What makes you stand out from everyone else in your category? Definitely the diversity in the group and the fact that we sing and dance, and always put on a performance with every number we do. Our image is just as important as the music – we always concentrate on how we look and ensure it fits with what we’re doing. \nReggie n Bollie: formerly Menn on Point REGGIE N BOLLIE (ITV PIctures) Share article \nThe band are: Reggie (31) and Bollie (29).

Labyrinth as he combines being a producer and a song writer. We love watching him on stage. He seems very humble. How well do you know everyone else in the category and have you bonded with anyone in particular? We are really close to New Kings Order and also Seann Miley Moore, Max Stone and Che Chesterman. Anton also asked us to do a video for his nephew as he was a fan of ours.
