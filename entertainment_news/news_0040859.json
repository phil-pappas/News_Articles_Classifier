Blythe was accused of pushing a 19-year-old who had climbed onto the stage during a 2010 concert by the Richmond, Virginia-based band at a Prague club. \nThe man's head hit the floor and he later died of a head injury. \nMichal Sykora, a Czech lawyer for Blythe, says the court on Wednesday dismissed his request to be paid 15.555 million koruna ($640,800) by the Justice Ministry. \nSykora says his client still can appeal.
