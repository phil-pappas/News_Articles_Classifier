It’s actually a bad message to tell someone who is obese that they look curvy or great.” \nThe pop star and X-Factor judge has previously denounced those who body-shame her, putting recent weight loss down to stress and bereavement after her father-in-law passed away. \n“But you know what? After this length of time, there’s nothing I can hear about myself that I haven’t already heard,” she added. \nOpening up about her marriage to Frenchman Jean-Bernard, who she wed last year, Cheryl explained: “Well, I’m not a sulker; I’ve learnt how to express my feelings in a calm way. And if I shout? You know it’s bad. Cheryl (Ian West/PA) \n“But I save it for the big things – I never lose it over the toilet seat being left up.” \nThe star also looked back on the time when she was dumped from The X Factor (US) by Simon Cowell – and says the stubborn music mogul has even admitted he made an error. \n“I never thought his decision was wrong; I just thought how he handled it was wrong,” she explained. “There’s way to do it, you know what I mean? You’ve got to face up to these things. Simon Cowell, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, Rita Ora, Nick Grimshaw, Caroline Flack and Olly Murs (Daniel Leal-Olivas/PA) \n“We didn’t speak for months. A lot of hard work had to be done – but I think it stems from Simon being a really soft-hearted person deep down. As ballsy as his decisions are, he finds it hard to say it to your face sometimes. But he knows he was in the wrong now.” \nCheryl, who is known for getting weepy on the ITV talent show, also promised: “I’m going to be tougher this year. I’m like a sponge and I’m too sensitive. It was making us ill with stress and worry. Share article \n“People think, ‘Oh, she’s sitting there in a pretty dress,’ but I get so wrapped up in the arguments that the contestants are having. It affects me.” Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T15:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:43:52.470+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
