(Rough cut - no reporter narration)   \nROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) On a windy autumnal Sunday (October 25) in one of England's most typical seaside towns, seagulls and spectators descended on the Arnold Palmer Crazy Golf Course - also known as Hastings Adventure Golf - to bear witness to a proud British tradition. The World Crazy Golf Championships saw 75 players from four different countries descend on the legendary greens on the British south coast and do battle for the title of World Champion, on what contestant Richard Gottfried said was the biggest sporting day of the year. The tournament's 13th edition took in six qualifying rounds over the 18-hole course, before the cut saw the top 18 going on to content the final round, fighting windmills, waterwheels, obelisks and a lighthouse, as well as the sport's ubiquitous ramps and bunkers. Michael Smith, a 29-year-old mature student, was eventually crowned champion after a closing final round of 32, beating by 13 shots the runner-up, Pasi Aho, who had travelled from Finland for the event, to the 1,000 pounds in prize money. The victory was his third title, following success in 2011 and 2012 as well, though he sought to play down talk of a future return to the elite competition. The next event on the British Mini Golf Association Tour is the Kent Open, on November 14 at the Lost Island Encounter Adventure Golf Course in Chislehurst.  //reut.rs/1O383Hr", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T18:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:42:26.400+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
