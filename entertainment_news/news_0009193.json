By Dash Coleman These days, Apache attack helicopters are the steeds of choice for the Army’s Lighthorse squadron. But the soldiers in the 3rd Squadron, 17th Cavalry Regiment still wear Stetson brim hats and silver spurs — homages to the cavalry in the Civil War.\nThe unit was reactivated Wednesday morning at Hunter Army Airfield, a re-flagging of soldiers from the 1st Battalion, 3rd Aviation Regiment, which cased its colors.\nThe 3-17 Squadron had been temporarily inactivated last month, not too long after its longtime OH-58D Kiowa Warrior helicopters were retired.\nNow, they’re flying AH-64 Apache attack helicopters.\nLt. Col. John Broam said he was proud to put on the Stetson.\nThe 1-3 Battalion — also known as the Vipers — he previously commanded will be reactivated soon in Germany.\n“As we cased the 1st Attack Reconnaissance Battalion, 3rd Aviation Regiment colors today, each of the Task Force Viper soldiers should have felt an overwhelming sense of pride,” Broam told the soldiers, family members and Vietnam War veterans gathered at Hunter for the re-flagging ceremony.\nThe 1-3 Battalion’s original activation was in Germany, and it’s been based at Hunter since 1996. The Vipers deployed to Kuwait in 1998 and to Iraq and Afghanistan during the most recent wars.\nThe 3-17 Squadron was activated in 1963, but the 17th Cavalry Regiment has been around since 1916 and was deployed during World War II. The 3-17 Squadron has been based at Hunter since 2008 and has deployed to Iraq twice to provide support for ground forces.\nBroam said it was “an absolute honor” to unfurl the 3-17’s colors on Wednesday. They’ll be waiting to provide support with their new Apache helicopters as needed, he said.\n“It’s one of the best attack helicopters in the world,” Broam said. “I know that we can continue the legacy of providing firepower and reconnaissance for the ground force commanders.”", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14790616.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14790614.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14790614.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14790616.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14790615.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14790615.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14790611.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14790613.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14790613.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14790611.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-07T18:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:25:53.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
