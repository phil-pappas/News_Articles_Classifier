In a hearing Monday, Oct. 12, 2015 in St. Albans, Quaid was ordered held on $500,000 bail on charges that he skipped out of the country five years ago after being charged with vandalism in California. Quaid and his wife Evi Quaid were detained at the Canadian border Friday night while trying to re-enter the United States after Canadian officials granted Evi Quaid citizenship but denied Randy Quaid permanent residence and said he would be deported. Evi Quaid was in court Monday in Burlington, where she also was ordered held on $500,000 bail.
