News . \"I've always done everything but Teresa did all the driving around, running around, paying for everything and doing all this and doing all that. I never knew how many expenses there are just in the activities.\" \n\"Damn, cheer's expensive. Damn, soccer's expensive. Everything's expensive, but I enjoy it,\" Joe continued. \"It's fun watching them and they did really good.\" \nTeresa reported to prison in Danbury, Connecticut in January after pleading guilty to tax fraud. Joe was also sentenced to three-and-a-half years behind bars, and will begin serving that sentence when his wife is freed. He also faces possible deportation back to his native Italy when his sentence is served. \nJoe said he now enjoys being a more stay-at-home dad. \"I'm like the mom. I'm like the cheer mom and whatever,\" he quipped. \nThe reality star admitted he has help in his eldest daughter, 14-year-old Gia. She \"is very mature for her age, which is good,\" Joe said. \"So is [11-year-old] Gabriella actually...having them two around was a big help.\" \nWe'll see how the Giudice family is coping when Bravo airs their three-part special, Real Housewives of New Jersey Teresa Checks In , premiering Sunday, October 11 at 8 p.m. Eastern. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:12:34.202+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
