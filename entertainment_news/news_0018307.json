The Daughter opens in Australian cinemas on March 3, 2016 .\nPT2M24S http://www.canberratimes.com.au/action/externalEmbeddedPlayer?id=d-44rvp 620 349 October 19, 2015 Autoplay On Off Video feedback Video settings He's one of Australia's highest-profile actors, but in the powerful trailer for The Daughter , Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush doesn't get to speak on-screen.\nThe Daughter is the highly anticipated debut feature from Australian theatre director Simon Stone.\nIt is an adaptation of his stage reinterpretation of Henrik Ibsen's The Wild Duck .\nEwen Leslie, Odessa Young and Sam Neill star in The Daughter. Photo: Mark Rogers \nRush plays Henry Neilson, the wealthy owner of a timber mill that's about to close. In the trailer, he is a stern-faced, tight-lipped presence.\nAdvertisement Off-screen, he says two things: he reveals the age of the woman (Anna Torv) he is about to marry is 31; and he confesses there is something \"I've never told anyone\".\nThe trigger for the action in The Daughter is the return from the United States of Neilson's son, Christian (Paul Schneider), for the wedding; a visit that stirs up simmering resentments and secrets.\nThe Daughter – which also stars Sam Neill, Miranda Otto and Ewen Leslie and marks the big-screen debut of Odessa Young – debuted at the Sydney Film Festival in June and, internationally, at the Venice Film Festival in September.\nIt was hailed by Variety as \"deeply involving and emotionally searing\", and as marking \"a confident and profoundly moving big screen debut\" by Stone.\nFairfax's Garry Maddox said it was \"a radical reinvention\" of Ibsen's play, with \"much to admire\".\nHowever, some reviewers have delivered mixed assessments.\nThe Hollywood Reporter judged the film \"well-acted but unconvincing\", and Screen Daily said its narrative \"wallows in familiar territory\", but praised it, nonetheless, as a \"weighty effort\" that \"succeeds in conveying intimacy and conjuring tension\".\nThe Daughter opens in Australia next March.\nFollow Karl Quinn on Facebook: karl quinn writer \nOn Twitter: @karlkwin", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:31:16.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
