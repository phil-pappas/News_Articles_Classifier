Organizers are asking veterans or those who know veterans to send information to the council. Call (630) 443-3794 to get information.\nI think you get the idea. Nothing comes in small packages for the St. Charles Arts Council. And nothing should.\nIt said it would work hard to keep the arts an important part of the city because St. Charles had such a glorious past in this area when it staged the St. Charles Arts and Music Festival every other year in the 1990s.\nCouncil volunteers have delivered on that promise. Now it's time to enjoy the arts and honor our veteran heroes at the same time.\nPizza as a craft: Tiger Prawn.\" Believe it or not, that's a type of pizza at Craft Works Pizza in Campton Hills. The new pizza joint looks to draw customers in with quite creative pizza choices, or craft works, one might say.\nTiger Prawn qualifies as one of the gourmet pizza choices at Craft Works Pizza, located at the corner of Burlington Road and Route 64.\nWouldn't you call it \"gourmet\" with ingredients like this? It has basil-garlic butter, buffalo mozzarella, artichoke hearts and micro greens.\nNo one can say we don't have all types of pizza choices in the Tri-Cities area.\nMore sandwiches: Autumn squash soup. Sounds seasonal, and quite tempting. It's one of the soups McAlister's Deli is showcasing as it opens its doors as another legitimate lunch and dinner spot at 1492 S. Randall Road.\nBut a deli makes it or breaks it on its sandwich menu, and McAlister's looks to have a variety of combinations from a southwest turkey melt to a New Yorker. You can guess what that is, and you'd probably be correct -- piles of corned beef and pastrami with Swiss cheese and spicy brown mustard on toasted rye bread.\nOK, I got hungry just writing that.\nA quick six: It's hard to believe the Geneva United Methodist Church will celebrate its sixth anniversary of providing free Third Tuesday community suppers this week. Time has gone by quickly since these hardworking volunteers came up with the idea to help families facing troubles in the recession, and then morphing it into a way for people to simply visit with others and have a home-cooked meal. In that time span, they have probably served thousands of meals at this monthly event.\nI started taking my mother-in-law to these meals six years ago and it became the highlight of her month prior to her passing nearly two years ago.\nWe figure it's been a highlight for many others as well. After all, what's better than great food and great company?\nWaterlogged construction: Townhomes under construction near Wheeler Park and also on Seventh Street in Geneva remind me of a question that pops into my head every time I see the frame of a building or home in place without a roof over it yet. What happens if it pours rain for a week? That can't be good, right?\nExperts say that it takes a long time for the lumber used to build houses to be affected by rain. So apparently it is not a big deal.\nSpaghetti celebration: What better way to celebrate the Cubs victory over the Cardinals last week than to quickly run over to the annual spaghetti dinner fundraiser hosted by my friends at the Tri-Cities Exchange Club? Well, OK, I would imagine quite a few folks found the various sports bars and pubs in the area a pretty good place to savor a terrific victory.\nBut it was all the more pleasant at the spaghetti dinner, held at the St. Charles Moose Lodge, to hear that Arcada Theatre owner Ron Onesti donated all of the spaghetti, sauce and meatballs for the dinner.\nYes, he's a music and entertainment man all of the way, but this fellow is deeply vested in his Italian roots. That means he spends just as much time on his love and knowledge of good food.\ndheun@sbcglobal.net\n News Festivals/Fairs Batavia Geneva St. Charles Charities and Fundraising Heun, Dave", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-15T21:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:39:07.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
