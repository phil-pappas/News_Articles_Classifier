However, Rick Moranis is notably absent from the list of the returning actors. Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter , the Canadian actor revealed that he would not appear in the upcoming reboot, saying that it didn't make sense to him. Moranis was offered the chance to appear in the female-driven \"Ghostbusters\" movie, but he turned it down. \"I hope it's terrific. But it just makes no sense to me. Why would I do just one day of shooting on something I did 30 years ago?\" Moranis said. The 62-year-old actor hasn't starred in any live-action movie since 1997. Despite his long absence from Hollywood movie industry, Moranis said that he was not retired. He just took a long break from acting after his wife, Ann, died from breast cancer in 1997. Thus, he decided to focus on raising his two young children. \"I took a break, which turned into a longer break,\" he said. \"But I'm interested in anything that I would find interesting. I still get the occasional query about a film or television role.\" Moranis also said that he would step back in front of the camera when a perfect offer comes, but unfortunately it's not \"Ghostbusters\". \"As soon as one comes along that piques my interest, I'll probably do it. [But 'Ghostbusters'] didn't appeal to me,\" he explained. Moranis admitted that he became quite selective in choosing a project. \"I'm happy with the things I said yes to, and I'm very happy with the many things I've said no to. Yes, I am picky, and I'll continue to be picky. Picky has worked for me,\" he said. The new version of \"Ghostbusters\" centers on Abby Bergmanone ( Melissa McCarthy ) and Erin Gilber ( Kristen Wiig ), who team up with with two other wranglers (Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon) to hunt down ghosts which invade Manhattan. Chris Hemsworth , Michael K. Williams and Neil Casey also star in the film which will arrive in U.S. theaters on July 15, 2016. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Ghostbusters News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:56:19.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
