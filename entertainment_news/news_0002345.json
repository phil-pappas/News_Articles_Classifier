The month-long food drive was kicked off with United Way's 6th annual Day of Caring on Saturday, Oct. 3 at the Gettysburg Area Recreation Authority. The event was sponsored by PNC Foundation, Thrivent Financial and ACNB Bank, in collaboration with Outreach Inc. Volunteer teams formed six assembly lines and packaged an amazing 27,678 meals - 10,000 rice and pinto bean meals and 17,678 macaroni and cheese meals. Our generous sponsors donated $5,000 which paid for 20,000 meals, and with an outpouring of donations from the community and Day of Caring volunteers, we raised an additional $1919.50 to package an additional 7,678 meals. Yippy Ki Yay! This bounty weighed in at an impressive 4,229 pounds or 42 percent of the 10,000-pound goal for Bag the Bounty this year. With more than 30 Newspaper-In-Education classrooms participating in Bag the Bounty this year, we are on target to finally make the goal! \nThe packaged meals, along with the rest of the bounty collected in October, will be distributed to 16 food programs serving the Adams-Hanover area on Friday, Nov. 6: Abbottstown / East Berlin Food Pantry; Gettysburg College Campus Kitchens, serving low-income families and seniors; Fairfield Mennonite Church Food Pantry; Gettysburg Community Soup Kitchen; God's Meal Barrel, Hanover; Littlestown Food Pantry; New Oxford Community Food Pantry; Pathstone Inc., Aspers; Ruth's Harvest , Gettysburg, Fairfield and Littlestown; SCCAP Food Pantry, Gettysburg and Biglerville; SCCAP Adams County Homeless Shelter; Survivors Inc., domestic violence shelter; and York Springs Food Pantry and York Springs United Methodist Church. kAm'@=F?E66CD @7 2== 286D C6AC6D6?E65 E62>D 7C@> @C82?:K2E:@?D 2?5 3FD:?6DD6D E9C@F89@FE p52>D r@F?EJ[ :?4=F5:?8i &?:E65 (2J DE277 2?5 3@2C5 >6>36CDj v6EEJD3FC8 #@E2CJ r=F3j ~?6 |2?286>6?E[ w:=E@? v2C56? x??j v6EEJD3FC8 %:>6Dj (6==$A2?j sC] !6AA6C $?2AA=6 vC@FAj *(rp v6EEJD3FC8 U2>Aj p52>D r@F?EJj v6EEJD3FC8 r:G:E2? r=F3j v6EEJD3FC8 w:89 $49@@= #@E2CJ x?E6C24E r=F3j z?@FD6j }#v t?6C8Jj v:2?Ej pr}q q2?<j %9C:G6?E u:?2?4:2=j v6EEJD3FC8 {:@?D r=F3j r@F?EJ @7 p52>D :?4=F5:?8 r@>>:DD:@?6C \"F2==Jj 2?5 E96 urr] x?
