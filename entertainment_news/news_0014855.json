Daniel Craig as James Bond (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer) \nHe told host Jonathan Ross: “I’ve been fortunate, I suppose, to meet quite a few guys from MI6 and they always impress me. \n“They’re very together people, way more together than I could ever hope to be. I don’t know, it’s one of those things – he’s fun at a party but don’t stay too late.” \nCraig’s latest comments come after he said he would rather “slash his wrists” than play James Bond again in a recent interview. \nThe actor, who will reprise the role of the secret agent for the fourth time in Spectre, was impressed by Oscar-winning actor Christoph Waltz, who has joined the cast as Franz Oberhauser, reportedly a villain. \nHe said: “Christoph is… what an actor. I made this joke that he used to come to set with his two Oscars and slap them down on the table and say ‘Right, let’s begin!’ He’s an amazing actor, he’s got this darkness about him and it’s such a beautiful nuanced performance.” Jonathan Ross talked to Daniel Craig about Spectre (ITV) \nCraig, who has reunited with director Sam Mendes for his fourth outing as Bond, said he is “kind of on the same page” with the filmmaker, and also discussed his co-star Naomie Harris, who will return as Eve Moneypenny following her debut in Skyfall. \nThe star said: “There is a great working relationship that’s a big flirt and it’s great to play and Naomie does it brilliantly but also, we get her involved in the story and we don’t have her sitting at the desk outside M’s office all the time… When you’ve got as good an actress as Naomie, you want her in the movie.” \nCraig will join his co-stars – and royalty – for the world premiere of Spectre on October 26 at London’s Royal Albert Hall, on the day of the film’s release.
