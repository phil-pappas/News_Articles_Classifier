The company provides members complimentary tickets to theater, concerts, comedy and a wide variety of live events for a flat monthly fee.\nThe Starter Pass gives a member a complimentary ticket to unlimited events in and around the San Francisco Bay Area . Once a member attends an event, they may book their next event. RushTix also offers their original \"Explorer Pass\" (2 tickets for $49 /mo) and the \"Patron Pass\" (2 tickets for $99 /mo), which gives members even more arts and culture choices.\nAccording to founder and CEO, Jill Bourque , \"We're offering the Starter Pass at a ridiculously low entry point because it's actually more ridiculous that great local shows are not selling out. The Bay Area has a phenomenal arts scene and we're about getting folks to experience performances in real life, rather than on a screen.\"\nNish Nadaraja , creator of the Yelp Elite Squad and now the Chief Marketing Officer at RushTix, adds, \"The quality of our local arts scene is so outstanding that we want to expose as many people to it as possible.\" The company already has partnerships with A.C.T., SF Playhouse, Slim's, Great American Music Hall, Cobb's Comedy Club, and a variety of local community artists, with plans to expand to six other U.S. cities early next year.\nBourque started RushTix in 2014 as a way to give audiences access to more entertainment choices. As a stand-up comedian and independent producer, she saw first-hand how difficult it was for theaters to attract new and engaged audiences. RushTix solves this problem by offering a unique discovery platform. RushTix member, Jehn Mikalacki-Sublett agrees, \"I've been a fan of RushTix from the beginning. Now with the Starter Pass, it's even easier to round up the gang for a double or even triple date night. RushTix holds the key to a slew of hidden gems around the Bay Area.\"\nIndeed, it's this chance to discover the arts and performances in intimate settings that makes RushTix so viable. With the Starter Pass, RushTix has now made it less expensive than a burrito (and just as delicious) to see amazing live acts and shows each week.\nJason Calacanis , a prominent angel investor and early investor in the company, sums up the potential: \"RushTix is a slick combination of Yelp and Netflix, curating the great experience for a price that feels too good to be true.\"\nAbout RushTix\nRushTix is the first unlimited pass to local arts and culture. Members pay one low monthly fee and get pairs of complimentary tickets. This allows arts enthusiasts to see more theater, concerts, and comedy with over 50 events each week. RushTix is a San-Francisco based startup with investments from Jason Calacanis' Launch Fund and Social+Capital Partnership.\nFor more information go to www.rushtix.com and www.rushtix.com/pricing\nFor any press inquiries please contact Joe Wright at joe@rushtix.com or (415) 841-2015\n releases/rushtix-the-netflix-for-live-events-announces-new-899-a-month-plan-300158665.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rushtix-the-netflix-for-live-events-announces-new-899-a-month-plan-300158665.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=SF26506&Transmission_Id=201510131200PR_NEWS_USPR_____SF26506&DateId=20151013", "http://www.rushtix.com/", "http://www.rushtix.com/pricing"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:10:58.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
