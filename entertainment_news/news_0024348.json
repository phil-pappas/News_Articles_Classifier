According to Visa, nearly 1 million contactless transactions are made daily, with contactless transactions representing 10% all payment card transactions as of August 2014 . Furthermore, 820,000 Eftpos terminals – accounting for 94.9% of total POS terminals in the country – are expected to be upgraded by the end of 2015. This will drive payment card transaction values and volumes over the forecast period.\n\n- Australia , like many other developed nations, registered an increase in the use of payment cards during the review period (2010–2014). While this provided greater convenience for consumers, it was accompanied by higher levels of fraud. In a bid to make card payments safer, the Industry Security Initiative, an association of Australia's main financial institutions and card schemes, replaced the signature with PIN-based payments at POS terminals on August 1, 2014 , which is anticipated to curtail card fraud over the forecast period.\n\n- Competition in the Australian payment cards market has encouraged operators to introduce innovative payment solutions. MasterCard launched its digital wallet MasterPass in February 2013 , following which Visa launched its digital wallet service, V.me, in December 2013 . However, it was replaced by Visa Checkout in July 2014 , which has additional features and enhances consumer convenience for online transactions.\nRead the full report: http://www.reportlinker.com/p03116877-summary/view-report.html \n\nAbout Reportlinker \nReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.
