Hughes South Bend Tribune SouthBendTribune.com Posted on Oct 11, 2015 by Andrew Hughes \nEarly in his career, Nicholas Hormann played a “space vampire” on the 1979-81 television series “Buck Rogers in the 25th Century.” \nNow, he’s playing the father of all vampire hunters in L.A. Theatre Works’ adaptation of Bram Stoker’s “Dracula” that makes a tour stop Friday at the University of Notre Dame’s DeBartolo Performing Arts Center. \n“I have a niece and nephew, and they say, ‘You scared the pants off us,’” he says by telephone from Oxnard, Calif., about playing Vorvon on the Jan. 3, 1980, episode of “Buck Rogers.” \n“The first thing they had to do was make a mold of my teeth so they could duplicate vampire incisors,” he says about the experience. “On the first day of the read-through, I just opened my mouth and got a laugh.” \nHormann’s not likely to get many laughs in L.A. Theatre Works’ “Dracula” as Dr. Abraham Van Helsing, a doctor and mystic called upon to help hunt Dracula after the vampire moves from Transylvania to London in search of fresh blood. \n“He has access to ancient lore of people who preceded us by centuries,” he says about Van Helsing. “He’s a bit of a scholar and bookworm. … He’s more interested in the big mysteries of life. He’s like Yoda, but he can’t be comical because if he’s comical it diminishes his authority.” \nAdapted by Charles Morey, L.A. Theatre Works’ “Dracula” retains some of the novel’s epistolary structure while also presenting dramatic scenes and preserving the theater’s hybrid of radio- and traditional-theater approach to its live productions. \n“Lots of costuming, costume changes — they’re tricky, quick,” Hormann says about director Matt August’s staging. “A certain amount of blocking changes from mic to mic, although we try to stick with a home mic. … There’s lots of visuals above us and lots of Foley sound effects that are prerecorded.” \nHe describes the story as “high melodrama” and says that’s both a possible obstacle and an opportunity for the actors. \n“I think we’ve decided the best way to handle it is full commitment to the melodrama,” Hormann says. “Otherwise, you risk camp. Because we’ve all done it, we know how much fun it is to be frightened. … We all want that tingle.” \nStoker’s novel wasn’t English literature’s first vampire novel, but it is the most influential: In just the last 20 years, the “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” television series, the “Twilight” books and films series, and the “True Blood” books and television series have unleashed armies of undead blood-suckers, with each series redefining the mythology. \nBut one quality of Dracula has remained: his sensuality and sexuality. \n“He’s a sexy dude when you first see him,” Hormann says about Dracula. “He’s a charmer. People love that.” \nFor its time, he says, “Dracula” was shocking. \n“It’s deeply sexual,” Hormann says. “I think Bram Stoker was crafty to write a racy novel in Victorian times. In a way, it’s more sexual because you didn’t speak of it.” \nAnd, of course, Dracula represents forbidden desires. \n“Why is it that some women always fall for the wrong guy, the dangerous guy?” Hormann says. “I don’t know why. Mostly, I think the danger aspect excites them.” \nThe juxtaposition of good and evil also plays out in the story, the actor says, as does another theme with contemporary resonance. \n“What was in vogue in British literature was invasion literature, the fear of the other, the fear of invasion,” Hormann says about the late 1890s. “Now, today, Eastern Europe and all of Europe are alarmed by the swarm of refugees, who, by and large, are non-Christian.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:16:57.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
