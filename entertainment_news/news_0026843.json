Name of book: \"The Student and His Professor: John Hannah, Ralph Aigler and the Origin of the Michigan State-Michigan Rivalry\" Author: David J. Young, MD About the author: The author practices internal medicine in Holland, Michigan. He grew up in East Lansing, graduated from the University of Notre Dame (1977) and Wayne State Medical School (1982). He completed his residency training at the University of Minnesota Hospitals. His first book was \"Arrogance and Scheming in the Big Ten: Michigan State’s Quest for Membership and Michigan’s Powerful Opposition.\" Book genre: Sports history Publisher: DJY Publishing, LLC Where can it be purchased? amazon.com , iStore, kindle, Reader’s World, M-Den (Ann Arbor), Schuler’s Books, and online at www.msu-umbig10.com Synopsis of the book: \"The book explores the long-standing, adversarial relationship between Michigan State President John Hannah and Michigan Law Professor Ralph Aigler. Their behind-the-scenes feud — based in large part on the controversial “athletic” scholarship — arguably played a major role in eventually transitioning a lopsided, politically mandated intrastate football series into a bona fide rivalry of national interest, one that even included a trophy! The story is built around four historical events: Michigan State’s quest for membership in the Big Nine; the Spartan Foundation Probation of ’53; the Paul Bunyan Trophy controversy; and the “name change” civil war of 1954-55. As it turned out, Professor Aigler and fellow Wolverine leaders — obsessed with keeping the newest member of the conference in its rightful place — played no small part in trying to influence each outcome.\" Why did you write the book?: \"While growing up in East Lansing, I became privy to a popular myth regarding the roles Notre Dame and Michigan played in Michigan State’s campaign for membership in the Western Conference. \"Arrogance and Scheming in the Big Ten\" was the end result. \"The Student and His Professor\" expands on that first work while exploring the relationship between the leadership of the two state schools during Michigan State’s first five years in the Big Ten.
