Sotheby's says it was revealed during a 2000 conservation. An inscription indicates it was intended as a gift to Manach. \nThe seller is billionaire businessman William Koch (kohk), who displayed it so it could be seen from both sides. \nHe's also selling a 1908 \"Water Lilies\" painting by Claude Monet. It's estimated at $30 million to $50 million. \nThe sale is Nov. 5. \nKoch is a 1992 America's Cup winner and brother of conservative donors Charles and David Koch. \nThis story has been corrected to show the correct title of the work is \"Water Lilies,\" not \"Water Lily.\" \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:57:26.327+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
