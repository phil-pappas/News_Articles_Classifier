The service provides a fun and social way to send a gift without any fees.\nSan Francisco, CA (PRWEB) October 21, 2015\nCloudGifts announces the launch of its social gifting service for sending gift cards over Twitter , as the Twitter Flight Developer Conference takes off today. CloudGifts' mission is to provide the simplest social gifting platform using 140 characters or less.\nFor example, today (October 21st) is Kim Kardashian's birthday. Anyone can send her a gift right now by clicking here .\n“There are over 1 million birthday Tweets sent per day, in addition to other special occasions.” says CloudGifts founder Justin Elkow ( @justinelkow ). “The CloudGifts team imagines a world where gifting is instant and social, whether friends and family are in the same room or miles apart.”\nMost cultures have a long tradition of giving gifts in various social settings. In our online communities, people already share photos, messages, videos, and music. CloudGifts provides a service that extends this to gift giving.\nWith a Tweet containing #CloudGifts, users can add a gift card to the message they are sharing with someone on the social network. Others can Retweet and easily join in the fun, making the gift more social than the average card or email. Each gift card sent through CloudGifts has the same $10 value to keep things simple.\n“Sending gifts through social media is the next logical wave as social media moves into commerce,” remarks Justin Elkow. “Gift giving is the most social form of commerce, and it has the potential to unlock more value for social network users and companies.”\nCloudGifts is an HTML5 web app, which means it is accessible from any mobile or desktop browser and is available at cloudgifts.com . The company plans to introduce iOS and Android versions in the future.\nAbout CloudGifts\nCloudGifts enables Twitter users to easily send gift cards without any fees. The service combines the joy of giving with the power of the connected web. It provides a simple, real-time social gifting experience. There is no other gifting experience like it.\nCloudGifts, Inc. is headquartered in Northern California.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13024246.htm\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/justinelkow", "https://twitter.com/home?status=Happy%20Birthday%20%40KimKardashian%20I&#39;m%20sending%20you%20a%20gift%20using%20%23CloudGifts%20https%3A//cloudgifts.com", "https://twitter.com/cloudgifts", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13024246.htm"], "published": "2015-10-21T14:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:55:34.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
