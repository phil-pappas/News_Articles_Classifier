The article, penned by Dr. Habib Sadeghi, sparked outrage throughout the medical community, especially because the American Cancer Society has refuted the claim time and again, stating \" there are no scientifically valid studies that show wearing bras of any type causes breast cancer .”\n“Gwyneth Paltrow continues to give unsafe medical advice,” says Dr. Alexandra Sowa, an NYC-based internist and clinical instructor in medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College. “By re-circulating this myth, Gwyneth Paltrow places the blame of getting breast cancer on women. It’s as if she is saying, ‘By wearing a bra, you brought the cancer upon yourself.’ Women have enough to worry about – whether or not to wear a bra should not be one of them.”\nDr. Monique Gary, a Breast Surgical Oncologist at Pennsylvania-based Grand View Health and Director of the center’s Cancer Risk Assessment Program, also says the idea that bras cause cancer is erroneous. Gary says Paltrow’s decision to highlight the article fosters shame among women fighting a disease with many unpreventable and unavoidable risk factors.\n“It's important for those with influence to direct attention to the preventable risk factors for breast cancer and educate and empower women to make lifestyle changes that we know really matter in the fight against breast cancer,” she says. “For example, the new screening guidelines proposed by the American Cancer Society for women at average risk for breast cancer. I'd love to see women in the limelight speak up about that.”\nSowa agrees, echoing the importance of focusing on real preventable risk factors instead of disseminating fear-mongering information.\nMore on this...
