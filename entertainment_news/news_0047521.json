Sometimes it even got a little heated.\nHere we look at some of the themes worth pondering further.\nWhat is beauty anyway?  A dirty word, says Frenchman Xavier Perrot, who not so long ago conjured up drop-dead beautiful clouds of stainless steel mesh and crystals and suspended them in an ethereal drift in the Austrian Alps. \nAdvertisement Given beauty is, in Perrot's words, \"very individual and a little bit about philosophy\" don't assume everyone's ideal garden is tranquil, leafy or even green. Athenian graffiti and goat-grazed landscapes do it for Greece's Thomas Doxiadis​, \"suffering plants\" in muted colours for France's Helen and James Basson​ while Phillip Johnson falls for waterholes every time.\nBeauty is fragile, fleeting and doesn't have to be pretty – indeed the Bassons worry that some of their gardens are \"over-pretty\".\nDoxiadis says beauty is a moral position (\"I think our job is to show the worth of things people think are worthless\"), while Berlin-based Martin Rein-Cano says \"too much beauty is like too much sugar in tea, obscene and lacking dignity\".\n\"It's so important to find new beauty,\" he says. \"The ugly of today is the beauty of tomorrow.\"\nDon't overlook the ordinary  In Bogota, Diana Wiesner​ fought hard to retain existing eucalypts for one of her environmentally sustainable, social-integration landscape projects despite the trees having been grown all over Colombia for timber since the late 1940s. Wiesner says they are part of the collective memory and fit with her desire to foster \"appreciation of the common and ordinary\".\nBoth Doxiadis and the Bassons spoke of the allure of tough Mediterranean landscapes left to their own devices, with one of the Bassons' pet hates being the desire to cosset plants with fresh soil and manure. \"I think that's a disaster,\" says James.\nDoxiadis, who has been known to adopt a \"strategy of zero planting\", isn't big on soil amendments either. His occasional take-whatever-grows approach can result in gardens that are barely discernible from the wider landscape.\nCelebrate the 'hybrid' Just as the eucalypts in Colombia don't look like eucalypts in Australia, when Rein-Cano saw a silver birch in the Dandenongs he said it wasn't the same as the birches he was used to seeing in Germany.\n\"When plants travel, like people, they seem to be the same plant but they actually become an original, a true hybrid … that constant translation is what a garden is … mixing makes things more interesting.\"\nA matter of time  Australia's Viesturs Cielens' 28-year-old art project highlighted how time is a \"central element\" in the way he makes and interacts with gardens.\nHe doesn't believe in rushing and is \"still tinkering\" with his first garden made over 40 years ago and asks new clients to give him a year to observe a garden before making a mark on paper.\n\"This informs my vision and leads to a much richer outcome.\"\nThe Bassons, meanwhile, are happy to wait at least a few years for their gardens to properly materialise, preferring to plant small so that plants better cope with the climatic conditions. But such fast results did Rein-Cano want for the park he designed for a poor, largely immigrant area of Copenhagen that he immediately set the tone by making the paving of one area red and another black. \nA place for weather Rain, fire, frost and moonlight can all be the gardener's friend.\nJust as Johnson extolled the virtue of collecting rain from our roofs and driveways and circulating it through chemical-free pools and garden beds, Wiesner's urban landscapes highlight how we \"coexist with nature\", including the rain falling on mountains and the flow of rivers. \nIn summer in the south of France, however, the Bassons say, even a puddle seems out of place. They talked about the benefits of fire as a precursor to regeneration, something Doxiadis warned was no longer always the case.\n\"It is the first indication of troubling, large-scale [climate] change.\"\nBeware of rules The final words, however, go to Rein-Cano who insists there is no such thing as rules in the landscape. \"One has to be very careful … if everything has to be glass or native or rocks, it is not the right way.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T16:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:24:34.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
