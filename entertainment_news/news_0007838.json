It was just hard for me to have friends.\" \nThe 25-year-old singer recalled calling to invite several girls from her middle school to go shopping with her but they all made an excuse - and when Taylor went to the mall with her mother, she saw the whole group there without her. \nShe added to America's GQ magazine: \"I just remember my mom looking at me and saying, 'We're going to King of Prussia Mall'. Which is the big, big mall in Pennsylvania, 45 minutes away. So we left and went to the better mall. My mom let me escape from certain things that were too painful to deal with. And we talked about it the whole ride there, and we had a good time shopping.\" \nDespite cherishing her strong friendships, Taylor - who is dating Calvin Harris - also values having time alone. \nAsked if she ever gets lonely, she said: \"I'm around people so much. Massive amounts of people. I do a meet-and-greet every night on the tour, and it's 150 people. Before that, it's a radio meet-and-greet with 40 people. After the show, it's 30 or 40 more people. \n\"So then when I go home and turn on the TV, and I've got Monica and Chandler and Ross and Rachel and Phoebe and Joey on a 'Friends' marathon, I don't feel lonely. \n\"I've just been onstage for two hours, talking to 60,000 people about my feelings. That's so much social stimulation. \n\"When I get home, there is not one part of me that wishes I was around other people.\" bang showbiz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T18:24:24.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
