Photo: Pat Scala \nPoetry \nON BUNYAH\nBy Les Murray. Black Inc. $32.99. \nOn Bunyah is the kind of book that more poets should leave behind, a tight and thoughtful selection of poems from the very centre of their being and aesthetic. For some this could be a suburb such as Newtown in Sydney or Carlton in Melbourne. For others it would be a river or a coastal settlement. For Les Murray it's the quiet rural valley of  Bunyah, NSW, 300 kilometres north of Sydney, the locality where he grew up and to which he has returned in later life after an exile of 29 years.  \nOn Bunyah , by Les Murray. \nSome might argue poets are, by definition, \"exiles\" and it seems likely that Murray knows more about his fellow Bunyah dwellers than they know of him. Much of what Murray knows is intuited from careful observation – or remembered from stories told and re-told in his relatively isolated childhood. A number of other poems are based on anecdotes heard more recently. In his foreword, \"Bunyah – A Background\", Murray describes how the book developed from a German bi-lingual edition of his poems about his home valley into a more extended version filling the space left by the deleted translations. This finely-designed hardcover book also includes some 29 small but evocative photographs. \nAdvertisement In this selection from 50 years' work, Murray has been careful, as he says, to \"confine the book's purview to Bunyah itself ...\". This seems to have meant leaving out some very strong poems about himself and/or his immediate family e.g. Noonday Axeman  and The Last Hellos  in exchange for other often shorter ones which deal more generally with the valley's landscapes, fauna, flora and cultural traditions. At times he has excerpted stanzas from older and longer poems in which, Murray claims (perhaps erroneously), \"I was learning to evoke rather than explain ...\"\nThe effect of this is to produce a sense of the region as a unit, both physical and psychological. In some ways (but only some) On Bunyah is not unlike Dylan Thomas' Under Milk Wood . It has a comparable lyrical energy and concern with human particularities and strangenesses. The \"Wee Free Kirk\" of Murray's Presbyterian childhood and the non-conformist chapel of Dylan Thomas's Llareggyub have a similarly restrictive impact on their members' behaviour. On the other hand, both Murray and Thomas are quick to pick up on examples of what outsiders might see as slightly \"weird\" compassion — as, for instance, in Murray's   Small Flag Above the Slaughter , a poem short enough to quote in full: \"Perhaps a tribal kinship, / some indigenous skinship / is equivalent to the term our neighbour saw / fit to award his amiable then-fit cuckolder, / now sick, whom he nurses: / 'He is my husband-in-law\".\nPoems like this are vintage Murray: compact, quirky, witty and, ultimately, more than a little moving. Murray's compassion extends to the non-human as well though he would seem to stop well short of veganism. The Cows on Killing Day  is a well-known early example included here. The last line of Local News 2 (\"and cattle wade in their peaceful tragedy\") is a more recent embodiment.\nBunyah can also be a tough place for humans. Calvinism has no time for \"accidents\" and those who are ruled out are ruled out for the duration. An atypically personal  example is Murray's poem The Blame , where a wrongly-attributed culpability lasts a lifetime. Only afterwards, \"Freed of blood, the name starts to return\". \nThe rationale for the ordering of poems is not immediately obvious. It's not chronological, nor is it divided up into sections featuring the human and non-human — or landscapes. It's rather like the closing lines of Murray's great poem  Equanimity  (not included here): \"a field all foreground, and equally all background, / like a painting of equality. Of infinite detailed extent / like God's attention. Where nothing is diminished by perspective.\"\nThough some might argue the visual imagery already present in Murray's poetry makes the photographs superfluous such readers would be missing how these same photographs quietly contribute to the book's total effect. They are nearly always well-composed but not illustrative in any direct way. A few are of unsmiling 19th century ancestors; most are either in black-and-white or a muted polychrome, showing disused buildings. \nOne (on p.15) shows a seated, less-than-one-year-old Les Murray, replete with an even-now characteristic smile, surrounded by an unfazed half-circle of free-ranging hens. \"Equanimity\" indeed – a mood which, despite some hard times, has never quite left him. \nGeoff Page is a Canberra poet and reviewer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:21:37.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
