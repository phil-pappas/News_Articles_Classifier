Smisek was replaced immediately by longtime board member Oscar Munoz, a top executive at rail company CSX.\nThen a week ago, Munoz, 56, in just his sixth week on the job, suffered a heart attack and was hospitalized.\nOn Monday, Brett J. Hart, 46, a United vice president and general counsel, was named acting CEO, with Munoz on medical leave. United has given no timetable for the return of Munoz.\nHart, participating in a conference call with analysts and media Thursday, said his vision and plans for United align with those of Munoz, who spent much of his short tenure so far talking about improving flight reliability and service quality for passengers, as well as listening to customers and employees.\n\"We are using what he provided in terms of a vision as a lens for executing on our plan for the rest of this fiscal year,\" Hart said. \"Those perspectives are entirely aligned, and there will be no dramatic changes.\"\nNew United CEO in Chicago hospital, stock price down Chicago Tribune staff United Continental Holdings CEO Oscar Munoz, who took over the airline little more than a month ago, is in a Chicago hospital for an undisclosed reason, although a published report Friday said the 56-year-old suffered a heart attack.\n“We have been informed by Oscar’s family that he was admitted...\nUnited Continental Holdings CEO Oscar Munoz, who took over the airline little more than a month ago, is in a Chicago hospital for an undisclosed reason, although a published report Friday said the 56-year-old suffered a heart attack.\n“We have been informed by Oscar’s family that he was admitted...\n(Chicago Tribune staff) Two concrete changes coming for customers, ones also highlighted by Munoz in an exclusive interview with the Tribune this month, involve coffee and the flight boarding procedure.\nUnited has narrowed down the choices for a new premium coffee it serves onboard to three, said Jim Compton, chief revenue officer. He did not name the brands.\n\"That was something we heard loud and clear (from customers),\" he said. \"It's a small example of a cadence you're going to see across the company, relatively quickly.\" He said some of those changes will be introduced in the next several weeks and others before the end of the year.\nAnd United this week started testing new boarding procedures at O'Hare International Airport, although officials did not elaborate on what those changes were.\n\"That's one of the things, quite frankly, that we hear a lot about,\" Compton said. Munoz previously said he didn't like how complicated United's boarding is.\nAlso, top customers have started getting a free drink in economy class when they don't get the upgraded seating they requested, Compton said.\nUnited CEO's hospitalization a reminder that transparency should trump privacy Phil Rosenthal At least United Airlines is consistent.

It’s no better at providing information about your delayed flight than it is about the far more serious matter of its CEO’s health.\nIt’s true the airline itself may not be entirely sure what’s going on, but in either case that only ups the anxiety.\nA few...\n(Phil Rosenthal) United, the largest carrier in Chicago and No. 2 in the world, reported a third-quarter profit of $1.7 billion, compared with $1.08 billion in the same quarter last year. Earnings of $4.53 per share fell short of the analyst consensus estimate of $4.55, according to FactSet.\nIncluding a tax-related gain of $3.2 billion, United earned $4.82 billion, or $12.82 a share.\nQuarterly revenue of $10.3 billion, a 2.4 percent decrease year-over-year, was in line with estimates.\nU.S. airlines, including United, are enjoying a period of financial prosperity, benefiting from full planes and low fuel prices. However, United has continued to deal with operational and customer service woes, problems that Munoz during his short tenure pledged to fix.\nUnited, Chicago's largest private-sector employer, linked the ouster of Smisek to investigations involving allegedly improperly currying favor with former Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Chairman David Samson. United reinstated a money-losing route from Newark to an airport near Samson's South Carolina vacation home. Also stepping down in connection with that investigation were the airline's executive vice president of communications and government affairs, Nene Foxhall, and its senior vice president of corporate and government affairs, Mark Anderson.\nShares of United were trading midday Thursday at $55.75, up 2.2 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is down 18.5 percent this year.\ngkarp@tribpub.com\nTwitter @spendingsmart\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune United Continental Holdings O'Hare International Airport Business", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56213694/turbine/ct-united-ceo-munoz-heart-attack-20151016", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5628da2e/turbine/ct-united-airlines-earnings-1023-biz-20151022", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56256dd0/turbine/ct-rosenthal-1020-biz-20151019"], "published": "2015-10-22T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:30:39.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
