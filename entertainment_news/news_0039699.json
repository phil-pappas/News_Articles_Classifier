He was expected to rule the roost, going by his good looks and immense talent. He’s known to be hardworking too. So, there really was nothing to stop him from reaching the pinnacle.\n\nBut we hear he has now started taking things casually. He is apparently too busy glugging his drink (and a few things stronger than that) to care about where his career is headed. The recent setbacks in his personal life might have contributed to his erratic behaviour, but even then we are surprised that this dedicated actor has turned lackadaisical.\nOn the sets of his next film, the director, crew and other actors have to wait hours for him to arrive for his shot, leading to frustration and discontent.
