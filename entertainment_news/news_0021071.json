But it is right. The world needs a strong Twitter and this is another step to get there.”\nTough decision ... Twitter CEO and co-founder Jack Dorsey said “this isn’t easy, but it is right.” Picture: AP/Richard Drew He said his team was working “to produce a streamlined roadmap” for Twitter and its other services including video-sharing platforms Vine and Periscope.\n“The roadmap is focused on the experiences which will have the greatest impact,” he wrote.\n“The roadmap is also a plan to change how we work, and what we need to do that work.”\nBut for one unlucky ex-employee, the grim news could not have come more abruptly.\nSenior software engineer Bart Teeuwisse revealed on Twitter he found out he had been sacked when he was barred from logging onto his work email account from home. He tweeted the screenshot.\nI&apos;ve been impacted by $TWTR &apos;s layoffs. This is how I found out this morning. pic.twitter.com/MbjFwYLcU2\n— Bart Teeuwisse (@bartt) October 13, 2015 He then later clarified that Twitter’s HR team had rung him, but the news landed in his voicemail. Evidence of that voicemail message is in his screenshot, received about two hours after an earlier inbox message saying: “You’ve been removed from Twitter”.\nPlease note that @twitter also called to tell personally I was laid off. Found out differently though before I could get that voice mail.\n— Bart Teeuwisse (@bartt) October 13, 2015 The messaging platform, which has not yet turned a profit, has struggled to expand its user base above 300 million, lagging rival networks such as Instagram and well behind the much larger Facebook.\nTwitter said the lay-offs will result in $10 million to $20 million in severance costs, and total restructuring expenses are estimated at $5 million to $15 million.\nCopping it hardest ... Workers in the product and engineering teams were most impacted by the cuts. Picture: Reuters/Robert Galbraith Twitter shares gained one per cent to close at $29.06, after trading up as much as five per cent during the day on Wall Street. The stock had jumped above $70 two years ago but slumped this year below the 2013 offering price of $26.\nOriginally published as ‘This is how I found out I was fired’", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TWTR&src=ctag", "https://twitter.com/bartt/status/653984707760156672", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/47d0ba3dcfc7d0e1945efb38c38f5fd8", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c425d8e603a72200be1a612f0e2f9ce2", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ff962f88222183b254509cea811c91d6?width=650", "http://t.co/MbjFwYLcU2", "http://t.co/BWd7EiGAF2", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e655f4cdb38cc903aa5d883beca4eced?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c80d0385f326782e548c83e83205d9f1", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/29aa8c9e7df2fc3d60f1cedc5efbb1b7", "https://twitter.com/bartt/status/653946266938818561", "https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/4239c7afe20d17751cdd8315329319d8", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0b6982a1678b0da22950bcaee37eaf7c", "http://www.news.com.au/technology/online/twitter-cuts-336-jobs-from-workforce-in-its-struggle-for-growth-and-one-employee-finds-out-very-abruptly/story-fnjwnhzf-1227568382159?sv=5f559d4d15c967ad94df8238e82a6011", "https://twitter.com/twitter", "https://twitter.com/jack/status/653912031997751296", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-10-14T06:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:12:19.266+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
