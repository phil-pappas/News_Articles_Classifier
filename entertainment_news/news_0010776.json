After being banned from performing in Mumbai and Pune by the Shiv Sena, Ghulam Ali was invited to perform in Kolkata and Delhi. \nThe Shiv Sena had defended its move stating that banning the singer was their tribute to the Indian soldiers, who had died at the hands of Pakistan in the recent ceasefire violations. \nThe Sena had also protested at the BCCI headquarters leading to the withdrawal of Pakistan Umpire Aleem Dar from India-South Africa ODI series.
