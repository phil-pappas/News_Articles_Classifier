After recording the last album and touring it, I think we all became better musicians and I think it shows in this album,\" said Brad. \nAll artist royalties and publishing royalties earned from the Brave Sailor single will go towards Amnesty International and the Australian Asylum Seeker Resource Centre. \nAnd the fundraising goal? \n\"One hundred thousand millions dollars,\" said Brad, with a laugh. chasing the jeffrey", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:04:48.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
