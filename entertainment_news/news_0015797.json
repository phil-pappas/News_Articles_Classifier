I can't really include it in any expectations of anything I do ever again,\" the 27-year-old singer said in an interview on BBC Radio One.\nThe interview was timed with the release of the a first track, \"Hello\", and an accompanying video, from her third studio album \"25\".\nIt is her first studio album since \"21\", which won six Grammy awards and sold 30 million copies worldwide, was released in 2011.\nThe singer said that with the four-year break, during which she gave birth to her first child, she had to make an effort to get back into songwriting.\n\"Getting into like the headspace to write a record I found really difficult,\" she said.\n\"Obviously now I'm a parent and also having such a break off I kind of fell out of the habit of writing songs and stuff like that.\n\"But no, I didn't feel pressure but also I feel like every album I'm ever going to write is always going to be following '21' ... No matter what this record does, my next record is going to be following '21'.\"\nThe release of the full album of \"25\" is set for Nov 20, her label XL Recordings has said.\n(Reporting by Michael Roddy; Editing by Gareth Jones )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:27:59.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
