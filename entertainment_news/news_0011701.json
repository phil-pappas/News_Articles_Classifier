And his whole team”. \nIn the video diary footage, Victoria says: “The reason I wanted to talk about what has happened to me is that I am a pretty open person. But also because more than one in three people will be diagnosed with cancer. And here’s the thing: having cancer is manageable.” Victoria is set to return to work full-time later this month. (Yui Mok/PA) \nShe added: “Having a mastectomy is totally do-able. I didn’t know that until I got cancer. And that’s what I want to tell people. I know everyone is different, and has different experiences. This is mine. And I hope you don’t mind me sharing that with you.” \nVictoria will be back at work full-time from October 20, but will have time off for further treatment. Share article \nThe diary will be shown during The Victoria Derbyshire Show from 9.15am on BBC 2.
