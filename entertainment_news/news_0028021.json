At night I couldn't sleep, daytime I couldn't focus. I thought I was going mad. I thought I can't tell anybody what I was seeing. If I told my friends at school maybe they would not be my friends any more. If I tell my parents they would say, 'move on, you are in Australia'. I just kept it inside me, these frightened things.\"\nIt helped to write and paint. Bangura would then rip up the results and recite in her head: \"You are not me. I'm bigger and I'm stronger.\"\nKaveh Arya, aka The Unlikely Poet: Writing poetry is confronting. Sometimes it is cowardice. Photo: Steven Siewert \nOnly when a friend read her discarded words did Bangura realise she was putting down poetry, and this act of expression was helping her to heal. The nightmares stopped in 2011.\nAdvertisement Bangura is one of three refugee poets who will open the National Poetry Slam Finals, part of the Word Travels' Story Festival, at the Sydney Opera House this weekend. Each had fled their home country, blind to what the future held, and found asylum in Australia.\n\"What if you had to walk from Dubbo to Wollongong with your children, then jump on a boat to save your family?\" the festival's creative director, Miles Merrill, asks. \"Or where would you go if the Prime Minister decided to bomb your suburb?\"\nOne of the performers in Writing Through Fences is Somali writer Hani Abdile, who spent 13 months in detention on Christmas Island before her release in January on a bridging visa.\nLike Bangura, poetry is Abdile's weapon against stress. With little English, the 19-year-old founded a weekly a newsletter in detention and runs Arrivalists, a weekly poetry night in Newtown.\nBorn in ward 209 in the political prisoner's ward of Evin Prison in Tehran, Kaveh Arya, otherwise known as The Unlikely Poet, writes as a means of escape, self-expression and social critique.\n\"To be honest with you, sometimes poetry can be cowardice,\" he says. \"Behind beautiful literature we can hide the need to speak, the need to cry. For me it's a way to invite people to care, to invite people to feel, and in that way it's constructive.\"\nArya, who came to Australia when he was 13, began writing poetry as a boy in imitation of the great Persian poet, Sohrab Sepehri, whose book his parents carried with them during their flight from Iran to Turkey.\nHis university lecturer came across one of his poems in the back of one of Arya's textbooks and urged him to attend poetry nights in Glebe.\nIn the same way as the single image of a dead child washed up on a beach in Turkey can shift global opinion, Arya says poetry works by creating a mental picture that bridges the divide between author and listener.\nHe's used poetry to open dialogue with marginalised high school youth in Sydney, and recently travelled to Syria as part of a humanitarian mission.\nPoetry underlines for him the idea that humanity is a work in progress, that the journey of a refugee is not over once they reach sanctuary but continues well after. Writing verse can be confronting.\n\"People maybe go through a separation, or parental issues or domestic violence or a war, or becoming a refugee, [but] I have experienced all of those things. You sort of create an attic deep beneath your guts.\n\"You open the door and it's dark and scary and you know you don't want to go there. It's one of those things you are always procrastinating, 'I'll do it later', but there has to come a time when you need to take a step down.\"\nSee live performance of the three poets 3pm on Saturday in the Waranara Room at BarangarooPark, and from 7pm Sunday at Opera House. \nScreaming Night by Hani Abdile \nI hear screaming within a silent night \nThe one that you hear, but can't see \nThe one that you know is a human voice, but you can't help \nThe one that you feel their suffering, but you can't share their pain \nYou hear their steps, but you are waiting for the time \nThey appear \nTo talk, \nTo be heard and be helped \nThey are still screaming \nIts sound, like a storm on a summer night \nTheir world is dark and everyone around them \nPretend to be blind or deaf from the reality \nThey talk carefully, when they tell their awful past \nThis is their story \nIt's part of their history \nThis is what is worthy to write \nScreaming \nScreaming.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:06:05.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
