TAMARA\nAssociated Press SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) - A California judge says regional Mexican music singer and television star Larry Hernandez will be extradited to South Carolina where he's accused of kidnapping and assault stemming from a business dispute.\nThe 38-year-old singer agreed to extradition during a court hearing Wednesday in San Bernardino. Hernandez will remain jailed without bail until authorities transport him to South Carolina.\nHis lawyers declined to comment.\nHernandez stars in the Spanish-language show \"Larrymania.\" He was arrested Friday at Ontario International Airport on a fugitive warrant issued in South Carolina.\nPolice in Newberry, South Carolina, say Hernandez is wanted on kidnapping and assault charges filed after a businessman accused the singer of punching him and pushing him into a wall during a dispute over payment for a concert last month.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
