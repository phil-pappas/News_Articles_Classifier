But on “American Horror Story: Hotel,” award-winning costume designer Lou Eyrich called the shots on Gaga’s garb. The singer plays the well-dressed bloodsucking Countess who owns the hotel on the fifth cycle of the Ryan Murphy-Brad Falchuck anthology series.We talked to Eyrich about what it was like dressing the singer for the part. Q: What was your reaction when you heard Lady Gaga was going to be on Season 5? A: Ryan Murphy was talking to me about it way back in February. We were working on “Scream Queens” at the time, and the news didn’t really sink in … but then when I got back to L.A. and we started doing research and prepping, it hit me. Lady Gaga is iconic, and she’s got amazing taste, and she works with an incredible design team. I tried not to let it freak me out because I’d heard wonderful things about her. Q: What was your first interaction with Lady Gaga like? A: I spoke with her on the phone first. She’d really done her homework — she’d watched a ton of vampire movies. She already knew all her lines. She was so excited by the opportunity to test her acting chops. I was very impressed by that and that she had a very clear idea of who the Countess was. There was no friction like, “Oh, boy, this is going to be a challenge.” It was pretty much “OK, we are on the same page.” Q: What was your idea behind Lady Gaga’s outfits for the show? A: The whole thought process for the costumes came from the hotel setting, which has this very old Hollywood feel to it. And the countess has been alive for about 100 years, so we wanted to be able for her to span all decades easily with her outfits. Everything she wears is old but with a modern twist. The idea was old Hollywood glamour –‘30s and ‘40s gowns, up-dos, diamonds. Just very elegant but at the same time eccentric. Like Gaga, the countess is also a fashion icon but in an old Hollywood way. Q: Did Lady Gaga bring any of her own items from her fashion collection for the part? A: She graciously has brought in some beautiful pieces from her own archives, things we could never afford on our show. It’s been such a treat. There are a couple of original Alexander McQueen pieces that were made for her when he was still alive that I find the most breathtaking because he was my favorite designer. Q: What was the most fun part about putting her style together? A: For me, the highlight truly was the day she walked into the first fitting. She came in just so absolutely normal and approachable, like a breath of fresh air with lots of ideas but yet such an open mind. She was willing to collaborate and discuss. It was a four- or five-hour fitting, and it was really fun.
