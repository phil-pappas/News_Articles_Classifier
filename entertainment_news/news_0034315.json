Which is good news for playwrights, as it means there’s a certain timelessness to the\ngreat works.\nAnd while we might know William Shakespeare’s works well, the work of his contemporary (and influence and inspiration) Christopher Marlowe is not as\noften explored.\nSo, with a much-deserved stellar reputation for their presentations of The Bard’s works, Sport For Jove is giving Marlowe’s 1593 work Edward II a burl.\nThe process has been a revelation, says director and Sport For Jove\nco-artistic director Terry Karabelas.\n“Because I have done so much Shakespeare, when I first read Marlowe, it struck me how lean and direct and economical the language is,” he says.\n“He gives you one line which tells you everything whereas Shakespeare would have written\na monologue.\n “And you can’t help but realise how much of an influence Marlowe was on Shakespeare, especially when you read Edward II or any of Marlowe’s plays. Shakespeare has literally ripped off a lot of Marlowe’s writing.”\nOf course, such observations aren’t new but what is true is that, like Shakespeare’s work, the plays have an eerie resonance with our world today.\nEdward II is a wonderful case in point.\n“(Marlowe) wants us to see this human condition as a complex one, where we are both our heroes and our anti-heroes,” Karabelas says.\n“For example, one of the ideas around Edward II is how do you reign when you cannot rule.\n“And what happens when you take all of your personal desires and commitments and play that out in the political arena and what impact that has.”\nThe play, which features a fresh young cast including Julian Garner as Edward, Georgia Adamson as Isabella and Michael Whalley as Gaveston, follows Edward II’s rule, beginning with his father’s death and ending with his own.\nBetween there is nothing but turmoil as Edward battles various elites to keep his friend (and presumed lover) Gaveston close, as his wife Isabella of France conspires with his enemies. It’s action-packed and moves along quickly, despite the broad scope of the work.\n“Marlowe’s structure is very modern in a way, because his scenes are very short and they stack on top of each other for a cumulative effect,” Karabelas says.\n“We are viewing it through the lens of a contemporary world and what I am really interested in is this idea of how politicians and royalty today live in the modern world, but conduct their business in ancient spaces. For example, politicians visit the Queen in the 1000-year-old Windsor Castle.”\nBut while the canvas is huge, those who populate the picture on it are largely caught up in prosaic concerns. Ultimately this is the story of a man, his desires\nand his duties.\n“It is a very domestic play,” Karabelas says. “Marlowe likes to focus on a domestic story so it’s a story about family and relationships within that family. We are trying to create that balance, between the interior personal spaces and what is the political space in terms of teasing it out, but still allowing the play to have a 16th century feel.”\nEdward II, Reginald Theatre, Seymour Centre; today 7.30pm, until October 17, adult $36, conc $25, 9351 7940, seymourcentre.com", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/84bbff6ab76cdb152e1bfacba74aca51", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/661d28ba08499db58de471efcb975ce8", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e0ecc9764913631058b7c705f58abf7d", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/66fa58f3fe82a85da51248d48a4fa31a", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ea6ca1a98282e6bba934db59ccd98576", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/7f9c8d60468fee74cfd347f61cd6227b", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-10-07T14:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:08:59.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
