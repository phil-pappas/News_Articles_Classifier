The 40-year-old dad took to Twitter on October 9 to joke about his son's photos. Jeremy was seemingly happy to see what his son could show in the viral photos. He tweeted, \"@justinbieber what do you feed that thing,\" while putting the hashtag \"proud daddy.\" He then posted a photo of a brown bulldog looking at the camera while putting its tongue out. A caption for the picture read, \"@justinbieber he's a beaut.\" — Jeremy Bieber (@JeremyBieber) 9 Oktober 2015 It was unclear whether the tweets were in reference to the \"What Do You Mean?\" singer's private part or muscular body. Though Jeremy tagged Justin in the aforementioned tweets, Justin didn't give a single response to them. The singer, meanwhile, posted the cover art of his new album \" Purpose \". Earlier this week, New York Daily News posted some photos of Justin naked while walking around the swimming pool at the beach resort in Bora Bora. Model Jayde Pierce was also photographed at the same deck but she wore white cloth robe. After the photos went viral, Justin's legal team sent a cease and desist letter demanding the removal of the photos because it's considered violation of the singer's publicity and privacy rights. The most recent report said that the singer wasn't likely to sue the NY Daily News for spreading the photos because the photos was said to increase his confidence . \n© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T05:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:10:35.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
