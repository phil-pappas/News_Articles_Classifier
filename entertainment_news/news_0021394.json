The Mets erased a 9 1/2-game deficit as the Cubs finished September with an 8-17 record and finished eight games out of first place in the National League East.\n“We’re ready to keep pushing on and hope to get to our ultimate goal,” Schwarber said.\nPresident Theo Epstein didn’t realize the magnitude of the heartbreak felt by Cubs fans until he arrived before prior to the 2012 sesaon.\n“I have my own personal Mets heartbreak from 1986 as a 12-year-old Red Sox fan,” said Epstein, referring to the World Series in which the Mets rallied from a 3-2 deficit to win the Series after the Red Sox were one out away from winning the Series in six games.\n“Our guys are too young to be worried or aware of (1969),” Epstein said. “They just enjoy each other’s company.\n“It doesn’t matter who we play and where we play.
