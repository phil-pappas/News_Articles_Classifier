The city has partnered with the Auto Merchants Association to replace the digital billboard. In return, the city will receive 12 minutes of advertising each hour. , PATRICK O'NEILL, STAFF Related article » A $241,000 digital billboard will be built along I-15 to lure shoppers into Norco, while a simplified building permit process aims to draw developers to a city long-encumbered by tedious approval.\nThe Norco City Council meeting Wednesday, Oct. 21, dealt mostly with fostering economic growth, particularly along Hamner Avenue. It’s been a common theme over the past two months as the city tries to capitalize on the soft opening of Silverlakes Equestrian and Sports Complex by drawing in new retail stores, restaurants and hotels.\nThe quickest, most noticeable change will be a 468-square-foot LED billboard in the 2100 block of Hamner Avenue, visible to thousands of drivers along the I-15 each day. The city will pay for a little more than half of the project, while the Norco Automobile Merchants Association will chip in $111,000, records show. Installation is expected to be finished by late November.\nAdvertising time won’t be such an even split. The city will get 12 minutes of every hour to advertise community events and local business on the big screen, explained Mayor Herb Higgins.\nRather than retrofitting the sign for $175,000, the Auto Merchants Association partnered with the city to replace it. The city’s one-time payment is the only requirement for advertising on the new sign, which is expected to last about 11 years before repairs are needed, Higgins said.\nThe city will pay for the project using part of a $845,000 surplus from last year’s budget – an achievement highlighted Wednesday in a fiscal year-end staff report. The remaining revenue will go into the general fund.\nA less glamorous change is underway in permit reforms. City officials passed an ordinance that prohibits companies such as storage facilities, truck rentals, and dog kennels from setting up shop along Hamner Avenue. All existing businesses will be grandfathered in, explained Councilman Kevin Bash.\nHorsetown USA –a city which prides itself on maintaining a rural lifestyle and large residential lots – doesn’t draw in much sales tax. To compensate, the city is agressively seeking point-of-sale businesses along three main corridors: Sixth Street, Hamner Avenue, and portions of Second Street.\n“Many prospective businesses don’t want to be next door to a shop that fixes radiators,” Bash said. “These businesses have a set criteria of what they want for neighbors.”\nNorco also approved contracts with two inspection services companies, Wildan Engineering and Bureau Veritas Engineering, to replace in-house inspections. In recent years, it’s taken city employees several months to complete the planning process. Higgins said contractors will ensure plans are checked within 10 days.\n“If I tell you as a developer it’ll take five months to get through the planning process, plus $15,000 for plan check fees, you may not want to deal with us anymore,” Higgins said of the old system. “We’re trying to be customer friendly.”\nLast month, the entire city council went to a convention in San Diego to advertise the area to developers. Council members say interest is pouring in from hotel chains and retail business owners looking to cash in on Silverlakes-driven foot traffic.\n“It’s a 25-minute wait to get a seat at a restaurant on Saturdays,” Higgins said. “Out hotels are booked. Sales are increasing, we want to build on that.”\nContact the writer: 951-368-9644, poneill@pe.com , @PE_PatrickO", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwn29b-b88541916z.120151022132700000gcscnul5.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwn29b-b88541916z.120151022132700000gcscnul5.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:33:45.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
