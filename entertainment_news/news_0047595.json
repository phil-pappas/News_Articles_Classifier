The Fox event itself will be filmed as one of the final components for the documentary, which has been compiled from hundreds of hours of footage shot since 2012. \nBolton and his team are aiming to fashion a final cut by Oct. 14, the deadline for submission to the Sundance Film Festival. \"Gotta Keep Dreamin\" chronicles Detroit's rise and fall before tracing the city's ongoing rebound through the eyes of Bolton, said Christina Kline, his manager and fellow executive producer. \n\"It will allow them to fall in love with the city like he did,\" she said. Michael Bolton interviews Duggan for Detroit documentary \nThe 62-year-old star was in Detroit on Thursday making the media rounds, including a news conference at the Westin Book Cadillac, where a film teaser featured historical footage and interviews with figures ranging from business heavyweights Bill Ford and Christopher Ilitch to entertainers such as Smokey Robinson and Alice Cooper. \nWith deadline fast approaching, Bolton said his interview wish list still includes Eminem, Kid Rock and Bob Seger. \n\"This film will be successful to me if it reaches millions and millions (of viewers) ... and lets people see that what they've been seeing and hearing from television pieces and print is not the Detroit I've experienced,\" Bolton said. \nBolton, a Connecticut resident and lifelong Motown fan, began shooting footage in Detroit for a promotional piece intended to accompany a 2013 album of Motown cover songs. Kline said she and Bolton noticed \"notable\" improvements with each visit to Detroit, and opted to move beyond the original Motown concept to capture economic and community development around the city. \nLinking up with local guides such as Phil Cooley (Slows Bar BQ) and Bruce Schwartz (Bedrock Real Estate Services), Bolton and his team found their way to projects like the Empowerment Plan, which employs previously homeless people to manufacture coats that double as sleeping bags. \nThe project has been financed entirely by Bolton, and Kline said she expects costs to ultimately top $400,000. Bolton said he'll pursue a limited theatrical release for the anticipated 85-minute film and will use his concert tours as a chance to push the film to new audiences. \nHe emphasized that his interest in Detroit is long-term, and that he's not out to \"flip a house.\" \n\"I'm invested by the fact that I've spent three years coming here, and (now) have dear friends here,\" he said. \nKline said they hope to follow the documentary with an hour-long Motown film using footage from the project. \n\"Gotta Keep Dreamin\" already includes musical contributions from Mike Ellison, Jena Irene and students from the Detroit Institute of Music Education, alongside a pair of new Bolton songs. Kline said she and Bolton are aiming for a final soundtrack that will include vintage Motown, techno and rock. 408 CONNECT 15 TWEET LINKEDIN 3 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/1KQ6tVm More Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:03:58.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
