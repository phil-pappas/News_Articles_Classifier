The first single, \"Looking Up,\" is out on Friday. \n\"Wonderful Crazy Night\" is co-produced by John and T Bone Burnett, who worked on the piano-playing star's rootsy, well-received 2013 release \"The Diving Board.\" \nLyrics are by Bernie Taupin, John's songwriting partner of almost five decades. \nJohn, 68, is one of Britain's most enduringly successful musicians, and a campaigner for gay rights around the world. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1998 for his contributions to pop music and to the fight against AIDS. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
