He’s one of the great rock producers,” said Adams. “I met him before. He came to see one of my shows back in the ‘80s in Birmingham when I played there. So we knew about each other. We saw each other again at the Prince’s Trust, not long after that, when he was hanging out with George Harrison. But I started working with Mutt Lange. I wrote a song called The Best of Me back in 2000 and I wanted Jeff to produce that but I didn’t know how to get in touch with him.” \nAdams also caught ELO in the ‘70s at the Pacific Coliseum as a teenager growing up in Vancouver. \n“I’ve always been a fan so it was no stretch,” said Adams.“And not just a fan because of ELO but because of all the things he did subsequently.” \nLynne, who founded The Traveling Wilburys with Harrison, Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison and Tom Petty, has production credits that include discs by the Beatles, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Brian Wilson, Randy Newman, Orbison and Petty. \n“You never know whether collaborations are going to work until you get in and start doing it together,” said Adams, who wrote nine new songs with longtime collaborator Jim Vallance for Get Up! which also includes four acoustic versions. \n“And when he asked me if I wanted to cut a track, I was like, ‘Yeah! I’d love to.’ The idea was just to do one. And then we ended up doing nine.’” \nWe caught up with Adams in Toronto recently to discuss working with Lynne, how he writes songs, and what he sings to his kids. \nOnce you knew it was cooking with Lynne, how long did it take to record Get Up!? \nIt took two years to make the album. That’s because the writing process takes time. I was doing other things. He was doing other things. He was making a record. (An ELO album called Alone in The Universe due Nov. 13). I was making another record (His 2014 covers album, Tracks of My Years). So every time I got a song that was kind of cool, I sent it to him. And he’d go, ‘Yeah!’ Or sometimes he’d go, ‘No!’ \nDo you see this creative partnership with Lynne continuing? \nI don’t know. Let’s cross one bridge at a time. (But) it was SO great. We became super good friends. \nHas songwriting gotten easier or harder as you’ve gotten older? \nIt’s kind of the same really. My songwriting is like gigantic mumbles. It’s just riffing out and mumbling. That’s not changed. It’s slightly more incoherent because I’m older, but that’s okay. \nYou’ve just come off your Reckless 30th anniversary tour. Will you tour so soon again for Get Up!? \nThis is going to be a big tour too, hopefully. It’ll change. It’ll have new songs. New visuals. We’ll have to get up and get at it. \nHow does the road feel after all this time? \nIt’s on a level which is really great because I have all those songs to play... The travelling, it can be a bit arduous. It’s not like when you could just get on a plane in the old days, now you have to go through security all the time. That’s just so annoying. It’s just unbelievable. I just don’t get it. I mean I do get. I do understand why. But why does it have to be such an unpleasant experience? I’ve said to my dad, who hates it as well, ‘Dad, just take that 15 minutes of your life and just close your eyes and count to ten the whole time.’ \nWill your kids (he has two daughters Mirabella, 4 and Lula, 2 with Alicia Grimaldi) come on the road? \nIt’s kind of hard to bring kids that are in school on tour. We’ll see. \nAre they little rockers? \nHard to tell because they’re so young. They love music, there's no question about it. \nDo they love dad’s music? \nThey like it when I play guitar to them. They love it. They bring the guitar to me. They drag my guitar over and say, ‘Papa, play me a song.’ But then I have to play Puff the Magic Dragon (starts laughing). But I make up songs about them. If I make up songs about them, they love it. There’s a big hit at our house right now about them which I have to play all the time. It’s No. 1 at my house. And they’ve actually modified it to (include) everybody else, all their friends. It’s just ... something that they can bounce on the bed to. \nTwitter: @JaneCStevenson", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:03:50.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
