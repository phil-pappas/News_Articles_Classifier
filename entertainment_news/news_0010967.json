Julie Noce reports.   \nRugby is rough sport... especially if you're 10 years old and up against the mayor of London. During a street rugby match against school children in Tokyo, Boris Johnson accidentally knocked over a boy named Toki. The floppy blond haired 51-year-old quickly helped the boy up and apologised. Toki took it all in stride. I was happy to play against Boris, he said. And some of the strongest men in Japan. Although they failed to reach the quarter-finals, the Japanese team's performance in the Rugby World Cup tournament sent shockwaves around the sporting world. Johnson is in Japan on a trip to bolster trade and cultural ties with Tokyo.  //reut.rs/1ZFECit", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T13:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:41:12.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
