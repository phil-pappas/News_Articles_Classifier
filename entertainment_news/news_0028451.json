The Las Vegas native has the luxury of sleeping in his own bed this week as he prepares to run in Saturday night’s Rhino Linings 350 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, and he couldn’t be happier to enjoy time in the friendly confines of his own home. \n“It’s so great to be back home,” said Spencer, a Palo Verde High School graduate. “You always mark it down on your calendar when you get to run at your home track, and I’m lucky because not a lot of guys have a big NASCAR-sanctioned track where they grew up. \n“Hometown bias aside, I truly love coming to this place because it’s such a fun racetrack to run around.” \nSpencer, 25, feels good about where the GMS Racing team stands heading into this weekend’s race, especially with the team coming off a victory by Austin Dillon last week in New Hampshire. \n“I think we’ve had a really great year at GMS Racing,” said Spencer, who has six career NCWTS Top 10 finishes. “Last year was our first full year in the Truck Series, and we’re an upstart team. \n“Everything we put together, we do in house, so to go from the start of 2014 and figuring out how to try and spell car to winning a race in under two years is such a great achievement.” \nHe said his No. 23 GMS Racing Alamo Chevrolet is in great shape for the 146-lap race, but making adjustments from practice to the race itself will be key. \n“The big trick for us running in Las Vegas is going to be making the right changes in practice. We’re going to be practicing in the day and racing in the evening. Growing up at the Bullring, if there’s one thing I know, it’s that with the heat you get out here and the composition of this pavement, it’s going to get extremely slick. \n“You almost want to be terrible in practice because when that sun goes down and the track cools down, you usually get very loose. It sounds weird, but I promise you that’s what will happen.” \nThe 219-mile race begins at 7 p.m. and will be preceded by a 2 p.m. driver autograph session, followed by fireworks. The Rhino Linings 350 is the sixth-to-last stop on the 2015 schedule and has been a fixture at LVMS since Jack Sprague won in 1996. \nRobin Leach of “Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous” fame has been a journalist for more than 50 years and has spent the past 15 years giving readers the inside scoop on Las Vegas, the world’s premier platinum playground. \nFollow Robin Leach on Twitter at Twitter.com/Robin_Leach . \nFollow Las Vegas Sun Entertainment + Luxury Senior Editor Don Chareunsy on Twitter at Twitter.com/VDLXEditorDon .
