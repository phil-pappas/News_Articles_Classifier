Parking is $10 per car — good for both days — with no admission fee. \n\"We have different things, from when the Indians were here right on up until the Bagdad Land & Lumber Company days,\" said Marshall Fuqua, who founded the festival. \"It's our history.\" \nMunson has always been a timber community. The Bagdad Land & Lumber Company, which closed in 1939, logged in Munson for years. Logging is ongoing in the community. Beaches to Woodlands boasts 40-plus events \n\"It's educational for the youngsters. They'll learn a lot about how things used to be done,\" Fuqua said. \"We older folks know that's not really that long ago. For older people, it's an opportunity to come in and rekindle memories.\" \nAbout 150 vendors are expected at the festival, about half of which will be displaying heritage skills like blacksmithing, flint knapping, using wood stoves, making wood shingles and making whips, and more. \n\"We're going to have a cane mill that grinds cane into sugar,\" Fuqua said. \"We're going to have a kitchen making syrup.\" \nThe festival will have opportunities for those with heritage skills to show them off, like black powder weaponry and archery. Beaches to Woodlands full schedule \n\"We're going to have black powder competition on Saturday afternoon,\" Fuqua said. \"That's primitive weapons like muskets that shoot the black powder. It's a free-hand shoot. In other words, no propping sticks. Most of it is going to be local folks. A good bit of it is hunters. Some of it is Civil War re-enactors who come in as part of the festival.\" \nThe winner will get an OL'Man tree stand. Entry for the black powder competition is $20. \nAn archery competition, with youth and adult classes, is set for Sunday afternoon. Registration for the archery competition is $25. The competition will pay 40 percent of registration fees in prizes. \nEquestrian enthusiasts are not being left out. \n\"Saturday morning, we have a trail ride,\" Fuqua said. \"The horse people will camp out at Krul on Friday night, and there will be a short trail ride in the state forest on Saturday morning and a long trail ride in the state forest on Sunday.\" \nAn open-class car show is also set for Saturday. Registration is $20 per car, with the top 20 places taking home trophies. \nThere will also be live entertainment both days from noon to 4 p.m. On Saturday, the entertainment will be country and bluegrass music. On Sunday, Rev. Kevin Nelson of Stump Springs Baptist Church will lead a church service at 10 a.m. from the entertainment stage, with gospel, country and bluegrass starting at noon. \nWhile Fuqua started the festival as a way to celebrate the history of the Munson community, it also serves as a funding source for those in the community who are in need. \n\"It's about trying to help people,\" he said. \"We try to help the people in our area who are less fortunate and have hard times.\" \nThe Munson Heritage Festival Committee votes on how to distribute the money. Common needs the committee meets include utility bills and groceries. \nWhen the committee decides to help someone, a committee member pays the bill or covers the need directly. They do not distribute cash to applicants. \n\"We try to do business in a way that helps people,\" Fuqua said. \"We don't help people do bad things. We help people do better.\" \nGO \nWHAT : Munson Community Heritage Festival. \nWHEN : Saturday and Sunday. \nWHERE : Krul Lake Recreation Area, 11098 Krul Lake Road, Munson (just east of the intersection of State Road 4 and Munson Highway). \nCOST : Admission is free.
