However, he responded quickly to the treatment and became stable in three days. Currently he only has difficulty walking, due to the thigh fracture. He will be perfectly alright in another six weeks,\" said the doctors treating\nSidharth gave his first public appearance after the accident along with his mother KPAC Lalitha on Thursday . Talking to media, he said, \"I think God has blessed me in abundance or else I wouldn't be talking right now.\" His mother burst into tears and thanked her friends inside and outside cinema for all the support. \"When I saw his face on the accident day, I thought he had left me.
