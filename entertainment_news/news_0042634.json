By Vox Populi “It seems that one of our states, perhaps one of the 13 original colonies, would have been named Columbus in honor of him discovering America.”\n“The Savannah Morning News joined with Forever Tybee, a political action committee that supports certain candidates, to cosponsor the Tybee Candidate Forum! That has the appearance of local media bias, even if none was intended.”\n“I don’t care for the Hardee’s commercials either, but tell me where there is a Hardees in Savannah?” [Editor’s note: There are locations in Savannah, Pooler and Richmond Hill. Go to hardees.com to find one closest to you.”\n“How can they say ‘no cost of living raise’? Everything I bought this year has gone up. From medication, to groceries, including my insurance. Why is there no cost of living raise? Congress got their 3 percent!”\n“Congrats to the SMN on their article about Shabazz. Too bad the county doesn’t have the guts to do something about it.”\nContribute to Vox Populi by calling 912-525-0VOX (0869) or emailing us at vox@savannahnow.com .
