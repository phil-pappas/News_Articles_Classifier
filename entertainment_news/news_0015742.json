Photo: Darren Michaels / CBS Image 8 of 8 You’re really super, “Supergirl” 1 / 8 Back to Gallery She may be surrounded by a stellar and sturdy cast, but in this particular superhero drama, it’s all about the girl.\nThat girl is the quietly enchanting Melissa Benoist , who plays the title character in “Supergirl.”\nPrime-time’s latest comic book series — and the first with a woman taking center stage on TV in more than three decades — flies into living rooms at 7:30 p.m. Monday on CBS.\nShowrunners Greg Berlanti and Andrew Kreisberg , the men behind “The Flash” and “Arrow,” said Benoist (“Glee”) was the perfect choice: strong, yet vulnerable, awkward, yet confident.\n“As soon as we saw her, we just knew she was the one,” Kreisberg told a gathering of television critics.\nMost important, Benoist’s Kara Zor-El is super-likable. You root for her from the get-go — whether, as bespectacled Kara Danvers , she’s taking orders from her demanding boss Cat ( Calista Flockhart ) or blushing from the attraction she instantly feels for photographer James — formerly, Jimmy — Olsen (Mehcad Brooks) or acting like a super-excited kid who, at long last and with much relief, has broken out of her human shell.\n“She had the strength, the hope, the heart, the humor, and just that instant likability,” Kreisberg said.\nWarner Bros. Television head Peter Roth gave her the ultimate super compliment.\n“(He) said after watching her that it’s the closest feeling he’s had since he saw Christopher Reeve ,” Kreisberg said, “and it really is the truth.”\nBenoist, 27, also knew instantly this was the role of a lifetime, and she was determined to do it justice.\n“The second that I saw in my email inbox the title ‘Supergirl,’ I just knew automatically that it was something important and it was something exciting and rare and that I wanted to be a part of,” she said. “She’s such a beacon of hope, and I knew that her bravery and strength were so intrinsic and important to who she is and that I really needed to feel it myself in order to play that. … I really have to believe that I’m a superhero.”\nIt takes Kara quite a few years to muster the drive to be all that she’s destined to be.\nWe first see her at 12 as her parents help her escape the doomed planet Krypton at the same time as her cousin, the infant Kal-El, who would become Superman. She somehow takes a time detour and arrives on Earth way after he does. A foster family, the Danvers, raises her, and she grows up in the shadow of human sister Alex (Chyler Leigh). Throughout her youth, she’s urged to conceal the phenomenal powers she shares with Superman in order to keep her identity secret.\nThis coming-of-age story really starts, however, when Kara is 24, living in fictional National City and working as assistant to media mogul Cat Grant , a fierce taskmaster who keeps everyone on pins and needles. Providing comfort is Kara’s pal, IT technician Winn Schott ( Jeremy Jordan , “Smash”) and a new friend, famous photographer and longtime Superman buddy James Olsen . Cat has hired Olsen away from the Daily Planet to serve as her new art director.\nInitially, Kara’s most prominent feature is her timidity. Not only does she seldom toot her own horn, but she also apologizes constantly, even when the infraction isn’t her fault. That doesn’t sit well with her boss, who abhors meekness in dress and in manner.\n“If you can’t take credit when you do something well,” Cat chides Kara in the pilot, “you’re going to be at the bottom of the pile forever.”\nHappily, outside of work, she does begin to soar, literally. Inspired by the reminder of her caped cousin, she takes to practicing her own powers — flight, strength and heat-vision — and her new exuberance is wonderfully contagious.\nThose powers are put to a true test when she realizes a jet is about to go down and her sis is aboard. So up she goes.\nAs Kara strains to hold the plain aloft and keep it from crashing, her face has a look of pure satisfaction; her eyes shine and her smile beams. She finally feels at home in her own super-skin.\nOK, but in this day of feminist attitudes and political correctness, will viewers accept that this 24-year-old is referred to as “Supergirl”?\n“We knew going in that ‘Supergirl’ might imply a younger audience,” Berlanti said, “but we felt like we can sort of take the power of the word back and say that doesn’t just mean young and inconsequential. It should mean strong and bold.”\nA strong woman, in fact, is the one who brands the strange new savior “Supergirl.” When Kara balks at the title, Cat mightily defends her choice. “I’m a girl,” she bristles, “and your boss and powerful and rich and hot and smart. So if you perceive ‘Supergirl’ as anything less than excellent, isn’t the real problem you?”\n“I love that speech,” Flockhart said. “One of the things I love about this show is it’s a real celebration of girl power. I was really attracted to it because I think it’s a great show for moms and daughters to watch together.”\nI’ll go a step further. Like the Richard Donner “Superman” movies, “Supergirl” may deliver plenty of thrills, but it also warms the heart. Both charming and inspiring, it promises sublime entertainment for the entire family.\nJeanne Jakle ’s column appears Wednesdays and Sundays in mySA, and she blogs at Jakle’s Jacuzzi on mySA.com.
