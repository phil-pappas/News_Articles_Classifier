The annual event brings hard rockers together for Ian's Chain, a charity formed to help those who might be thinking about suicide. Alan Savill, a radio DJ in England , who has a passion for things that-are loud, helped form the event with some Philadelphia area rockers, like Donn Parent and Staci Black. With the internet able to bring people together instantly, the Savil's have become friends with many people across the pond. Savil's son Ian committed suicide just days before Christmas, some years back, Savill wants to help others and he does this through his charity.\nMoney raised from this event goes to the charity, but some of it stays right here in Philadelphia. American Foundation for Suicide Prevention had representatives there to hand out literature. The concert was not for the faint of heart, as bands like Decypher , We Our War, Old man savage and Power Theory were on hand to insure everyone was banging their heads and were responsible for the ringing in peoples ears later the next day. Some bands, like Twisted State of Mind , who came over from the United Kingdom to play are veterans of Sav-Fest, having played in all three.\nOur course, to raise cash , there were t shirts that were for sale. Bracelets too. The music got under way with Old Man Savage about 8;00 p.m. some of the bands , like POWER THEORY sound like classic metal,. They have a CD called Driven by Fear out that was moving a quite well at the back table. The best song on it is \"Don't Think Twice\" , not the title track or the single \"Cut and Run\". This album was produced by Peter Baltes from Accept , who used to live in the area. Most of the band members hail from the Philly area, with the exception of Jeff Rose, the guitarist who is over 100 miles away.\nOther bands had CD's for sale as well. The crowd was not into the metal bands that sound like someone is gargling drain cleaner. That kind of music is fast getting played out and people want more melodies and harmonies in their music, which is why when bands like Decypher and Swampbox were playing, they drew larger, and louder crowds. The show rocked so hard it went into the next morning. closing out at about 1:30 a.m.", "external_links": ["http://www.afsp.org/", "https://www.facebook.com/POWERTHEORY1?fref=ts", "https://www.facebook.com/dobbsphilly?fref=ts", "https://www.facebook.com/savfestival?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-12T02:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:37:10.658+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
