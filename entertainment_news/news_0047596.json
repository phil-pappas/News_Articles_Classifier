The possibility of survival...\nIn the movie, Damon, who has received positive reviews from critics, plays astronaut Mark Watney who is stranded on Mars after his crew mates -- believing he's dead -- evacuate a sandstorm leaving him behind. With very few supplies, he draws on his wit and spirit in hopes of survival and finding a way to signal to Earth that he's alive.\nAlong with Damon, the movie stars Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Kate Mara, Kristen Wiig, Sean Bean and Donald Glover.\nFrom left, Kate Mara, Kristen Wiig, Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain arrives for the UK premiere of \"The Martian\" at Leicester Square in London, Sept. 24, 2015. Stefan Wermuth/Reuters\nBut it's Damon who has most of the screen-time.\nScott ( \"Blade Runner,\" \"Gladiator\") spoke with \"CBS This Morning\" on Wednesday about how the 44-year-old star got into character while acting by himself, alongside 28 GoPro cameras.\nCheck out what critics have to say about the \"The Martian,\" in theaters now:\n\"Cynical as I am about how monster-budget blockbusters have come to dominate the studio mind-set, I can't imagine anyone not liking this one.\" -- David Edelstein, New York Magazine\n\"Damon is terrific. The movie lives and breathes on his performance, and he comes through in every scene ... You look at the names in this cast and you'd be correct in assuming this is going to be one helluva fun movie to watch.\" -- Richard Roeper, Chicago Sun-Times\nMust-see fall 2015 movies \"Ridley Scott rediscovers his light touch in a space epic that's fun to geek out at. Damon -- a fine actor with the magnetism you only find in a true movie star -- keeps you glued...Cornball? Maybe. But 'The Martian' is a hell of a joyride.\" -- Peter Travers, Rolling Stone\n\"What makes this epic personal is Mr. Scott's filmmaking, in which every soaring aerial shot of the red planet is answered by the intimate landscape of a face.\" -- Manohla Dargis, New York Times\n\"As elaborate and expensive-looking as 'The Martian' is, it's almost totally lacking in poetry.\" -- Stephanie Zacharek, Village Voice\n\"'The Martian' should do far more than just make Fox a ton of money; it could conceivably rekindle interest in the space program and inspire a new generation of future astronauts.\" -- Peter Debruge, Variety\n\"['The Martian'] is the kind of film you leave the theater itching to tell your friends to see. Like 'Apollo 13' and 'Gravity,' it turns science and problem solving into an edge-of-your-seat experience.\" -- Chris Nashawaty, Entertainment Weekly\nTell us: Do you want to go see \"The Martian\"?", "external_links": ["http://variety.com/2015/film/festivals/toronto-film-review-matt-damon-in-the-martian-1201590528/", "http://www.vulture.com/2015/10/movie-review-the-martian-soars.html", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/02/movies/review-in-the-martian-marooned-but-not-alone.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&_r=0", "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/09/03/3365fb07-988b-4706-a246-46ce687d35c0/thumbnail/220x140/99c6c1066a50039cc70ea69a647b53e3/joy-gallery3-gallery-image.jpg", "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/09/29/b1945ea3-a679-4f8e-b212-d4be8164ffa2/thumbnail/220x140/a92a692de0792ab207b04e88aa65a1bd/ctmmartian0929449669640x360.jpg", "http://www.villagevoice.com/film/life-finds-a-way-damon-s-got-more-spirit-in-him-than-the-martian-itself-does-7703991", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ue4PCI0NamI", "http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/the-martian-20150930", "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/10/02/8f59dcc7-5c2c-42c6-8417-7a51181543ec/thumbnail/620x350/27c2b436f0c0aeef8f3d736bb0002ac0/2015-09-24t190717z160709360gf10000219531rtrmadp3britain-entertainment.jpg", "http://entertainment.suntimes.com/movies/martian-lonely-planet-matt-damon-thrives/", "http://www.ew.com/article/2015/09/29/the-martian-ew-review"], "published": "2015-10-02T20:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:52:42.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
