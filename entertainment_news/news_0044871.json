This move is remarkable as it represents the first time a Binary Options Trading Platform has introduced a No Deposit Bonus. This means that a new customer can get real money to trade with for free. If the customer can trade successfully enough to reach the trade volume requirement attached to the bonus the customer can win up to £100 without ever reaching in to their pocket to make any deposit.\nThe British licensed and regulated binary options platform MarketsWorld has refined the approach to welcome bonuses for new customers. Bruce Maclean, PR Manager explains: “The binary options industry has a terrible reputation for the misuse of bonuses, with many “bonuses” actually trapping customers’ deposits so they are unable to withdraw. MarketsWorld has never taken this approach with our bonus system, we have always operated with a separate bonus account so that bonuses and client funds do not mix. Consequently MarketsWorld customers can withdraw from their account at any time. We have noticed however that there is an understandable reluctance towards accepting bonuses from new customers who have probably experienced bonus “lock in” from other BO platforms in the past.”\nThe problem of trapping binary traders' funds through so-called bonuses became such a well known shady practice that one regulator had to make this practice illegal. The Cyprus authority last year decided that operators had to stop their unfair bonus practices that had been allowed to go on for too long within the binary options industry particularly with the operators in Cyprus where many of the worst offenders had set up shop. MarketsWorld were really vindicated by this decision as the Cyprus authorities essentially ruled that bonuses had to be the way MarketsWorld had been providing them since the very beginning, without trapping or locking up a trader's deposits by preventing withdrawals until the bonus trade volume was met.\nOnce again leading the way in the industry, MarketsWorld has now gone one step further with their new customers bonus structure, making it even clearer and easier to understand the bonuses and allowing new customers to choose which bonus they want, including the new No Deposit Bonus which lets a new customer potentially win up to £100 without having to invest a penny of their own money. Maclean continues: “Bonuses at MarketsWorld have always been true to the word. We believe a bonus should be a bonus and not a trick. That is precisely why MarketsWorld has offered our new customers various bonuses that provide the customers with real value. We have developed our bonuses to now offer our customers the choice between the welcome bonus they would like best or opting out completely. This freedom allows our new customers to choose the right bonus for them, whether it be the 100% Cash Match up to £1,000, the £50 Risk Free Trade, or the new, £10 No Deposit Bonus. Of course for those who do not take a bonus immediately, they can do so at any time should they later decide they wish to do so, simply by contacting our 24 Hour Live Help Desk.\"\nNote that the same bonuses are available in US Dollars, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars, and Euros in the same denominations. MarketsWorld has various currencies in which their customers can choose to operate accounts.\nThe British licensed and regulated binary options platform MarketsWorld has done it again with another industry first with the No Deposit Bonus which now allows customers to experience real money trading with no risk as they do not need to deposit to get the bonus. MacLean: \"We have thousands of customers using unlimited demo accounts and we wanted to provide a way for them to trade for no risk to their deposit, the No Deposit Bonus allows this to happen!”\nCombining the lowest deposits, of just $10 the highest returns of up to 100% and the lowest trade size of just $1, MarketsWorld is keen to ensure that customers now benefit from a truly transparent bonus program. MacLean continues: “It is now extremely easy for new customers to understand and claim the bonus of their choice, they simply enter the bonus code at the point of creating a real money account and this bonus is then automatically applied to their account. Of course we welcome all new customers and our award winning 24/7 Live Support Team are on hand should anyone have any questions, but we hope to be now recognized as the only Binary Options platform that has a standalone and industry leading welcome bonus program which offers real value, which is the whole point of a bonus in our view. Other operators seem to think it is better to use the word bonus to trick people. Whereas at MarketsWorld we rely on our reputation and repeat business and our philosophy continues to be that a bonus should be something of benefit to reward our customers. ”\nThe No Deposit Bonus is sure to become very popular as it gives traders a chance to win up to £100 without having to invest a penny.
