If you can't clean under your nails and you want to touch me, forget it. Personally, lesser the hair, the better. I like a trimmed man but not completely waxed. I'm not into that f***boy look,” Glamour magazine quoted Perry as saying. \nThe 30-year-old also shared that there is a certain fragrance which always takes her back to memories of her first boyfriend. \n\"If I meet a guy in the elevator who's wearing 'Acqua di Gio', I think of my first boyfriend. One of my favourite things about fragrance is the powerful memories associated with it,” Perry said. \n\"My signature scent now is, and always has been, a blend of vanillas. And I never spray it on my skin. I spritz and walk through--or levitate through. I like to spray it on my hair too. With 'Mad Potion', the two main ingredients are exotic vanilla and androgynous musk. It's definitely a sweeter perfume. I like to be edible. I want somebody to ... eat me,” she added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:36:33.260+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
