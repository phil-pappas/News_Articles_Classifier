Three restaurants owned by the same group have closed in the Morningside community. \nThis comes on the heels on the abrupt closing of an entire restaurant group on a single day last week. The latest restaurants to close are all on the same block in Morningside. \nOne is called the Family Dog – a beer and burgers kind of place. Another is Rosebud, which is a more stylish restaurant across the street. And the third is an Italian restaurant called Timone's. That restaurant closed in July. \nA man answering a phone at the corporate headquarters of the three restaurants told 11Alive news all three restaurants are now closed. We requested further comment, but haven't heard back. B \nBecause all three restaurants are on the same block of Highland Avenue – their closings have left a big gap in that neighborhood. \n\"It's devastating,\" said Stuart Moulder, who lives nearby. \"You know there are a lot of people living in this neighborhood that count on family oriented restaurants to eat in. We are sorry that they have all closed at the same time.\" \nThe owner of The Great Frame Up says his framing business benefited from having the restaurant traffic on the same block. \"It's sad. We will miss them. It will definitely impact the neighborhood quite a bit,\" said Andy Shalosky, the store owner. \nThe three closed restaurants are owned by Atlanta Chef Ron Eyester, nicknamed \"the angry chef\" according to the web site \"What Now Atlanta,\" which first broke this story. Eyester has appeared on episodes of Top Chef, a reality show featuring cooks. \nWhat Now Atlanta reports that Eyester released a letter to patrons in September outlining his struggles to keep the three Morningside restaurants open. 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.11alive.com/1RFWyEm TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T00:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:02:40.986+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
