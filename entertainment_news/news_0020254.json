The British actor explains that the movie contains an entire \"prologue\" in the sequence, which includes the destruction of the Wayne Financial Building. \n\"What happens there is one of Bruce's buildings gets destroyed and he's trying to save all the people inside the building and he can't,\" Cavill said. \"So he is this angry person who fears what Superman may do. Why are they just going to trust this super-powered alien? What if he does decide to turn against us?\" \nWarner Bros. will release the film on March 25. For his part, Affleck elaborated on why his Batman has gone after Superman. \n\"He's found himself in a place of harboring a tremendous amount of rage for Superman,\" Affleck said. \"So it's how he got there, and what that's done to him, and what that's done to people around him like Alfred, who are, I think, very scared and worried for him. It's something that's interesting and new.\" \nAffleck also commented on the possibility of directing a solo Batman movie -- a scenario that emerged in July -- after writing the script with Geoff Johns. \n\"If I could make it work, yeah, obviously that would be like a dream,\" he told the magazine. \"The trick is, as to any movie, is to make sure that you - if you're going to direct it - that you can make it good. You've got to have the right idea and the right take on it... Broadly speaking, it's something I'd be open to, for sure. It's a very exciting idea.\" \nIn \"Batman v Superman,\" with DC superheroes at war with one another, a new threat arises and puts mankind in greater danger than it's ever known before. \nZack Snyder directed from a script by Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer. Producers are Charles Roven and Deborah Snyder. \nThe film also stars Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, with Amy Adams, Laurence Fishburne and Diane Lane returning from \"Man of Steel.\" Jesse Eisenberg stars as Lex Luthor, Jeremy Irons stars as Alfred and Holly Hunter will play a role newly created for the film. Jason Momoa will appear as Aquaman. Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T21:01:58.249+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
