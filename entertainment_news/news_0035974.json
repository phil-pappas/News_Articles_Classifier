(Photo: Evan Agostini/Invision/AP)\n12 CONNECT 57 TWEET LINKEDIN 13 COMMENT EMAIL MORE This week, Jennifer Lawrence made headlines for her powerful essay about wage inequality in Hollywood, including the pressure to be \"adorable\" and \"likable\" even in salary negotiations.\nSince it was published as part of Lena Dunham's feminist newsletter Lenny on Tuesday, celebrities such as Bradley Cooper , Jessica Chastain and Carey Mulligan have been vocal in their support of Lawrence. Talking about her new film, Suffragette — which charts women's fight for equal rights and pay in early 20th century Britain — Mulligan told USA TODAY that she hasn't yet read Lawrence's essay, but hopes it can help affect change on a broader scale.\nUSA TODAY\nJennifer Lawrence on sexism: I'm 'over' being likable\n\"It is unfair and something that should be remedied, but you hope that by speaking out about the pay gap within the entertainment business, that it has a wider effect,\" Mulligan says. \"We've got such a huge gap in the boardroom and in business and in every aspect of society, (and) we've got a platform to speak about it. I'm always hyper-aware that my job is a joy to me and something that I'm paid an awful lot of money to do for something that I love. I'm not a doctor or a nurse, I'm an actress.\"\nThat said, \"it's vital that we're all equally treated,\" Mulligan adds. \"I do hope the conversation around pay in Hollywood has a bigger effect on society as a whole and that it isn't ultimately self-serving. It would be a shame for it to become just a conversation about that.\"\nAsked about her own experiences negotiating salaries or being paid less than male co-stars, the Oscar-nominated actress says \"it's not something that I've been aware of. I've worked, on the whole, on indie films. I'm sure it's gone on and I'm sure it happens, but it's not something I've known. I don't know how I would find out.\"\nIn addition to Suffragette (opens in New York and Los Angeles Oct. 23, before expanding nationwide), Mulligan starred in period romance Far from the Madding Crowd this year and made her Broadway debut with Bill Nighy in Skylight , for which she earned a Tony Award nomination.\nLast month, Mulligan and her husband, musician Marcus Mumford, welcomed a baby girl, Evelyn. It's a name they \"just picked out of thin air,\" Mulligan says, adding that she's been \"working, but good\" since giving birth.\n12 CONNECT 57 TWEET LINKEDIN 13 //usat.ly/1Lwvzdu TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/17bbf1e107ca2d1484e9891d4ba1967254e5637a/c=94-0-2907-2115&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635805318488649242-AP-APTOPIX-NY-PREMIERE-OF-SUFFRAGETTE-76702200.JPG", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Lwvzdu&mini=true", "http://usat.ly/1Lwvzdu", "http://variety.com/2015/film/news/jennifer-lawrence-pay-gap-jessica-chastain-1201618672/", "http://us11.campaign-archive1.com/?u=a5b04a26aae05a24bc4efb63e&id=64e6f35176&e=1ba99d671e#wage", "http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/bradley-cooper-responds-jennifer-lawrences-essay-gender-pay/story?id=34475821", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cc8d074e166f7352a996258022eb7b1d82710c7e/c=584-0-2917-2333/local/-/media/2015/10/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635803301016250556-AP-People-Lawrence-Schumer.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ae8c18203a33be29888b2941e900df4ccd37225c/r=500x352/local/-/media/2015/10/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635805318488649242-AP-APTOPIX-NY-PREMIERE-OF-SUFFRAGETTE-76702200.JPG", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Lwvzdu&text=Carey%20Mulligan%3A%20Hollywood%20wage%20gap%20is%20%27unfair%27&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635805318488649242-AP-APTOPIX-NY-PREMIERE-OF-SUFFRAGETTE-76702200.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-16T04:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:41:25.382+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
