UMMA and brings modern and contemporary art exhibitions to the region, presenting approximately 12 original exhibitions each year. UMMA's fall exhibitions run through Dec. 31. \nIn conjunction with the Maine Photo Project, this year’s statewide photography collaboration, UMMA is presenting a selection of images acquired by Bruce Brown, Curator Emeritus at the Midcoast’s Center for Maine Contemporary Art. One of Maine’s leading photography collectors, Brown began collecting in earnest in 1989. Since then, his passion for the discipline and its practitioners has resulted in an extensive collection of photographs taken by artists residing in Maine and fueled by its creative sense of place. \n“Celebrating Photography in Maine: Selections from the Bruce Brown Collection” illustrates an intriguing collaboration between curator and collector as works were selected in a call-and-response manner. UMMA curator George Kinghorn first selected a compelling image, which prompted Brown to choose a fitting companion piece based on a variety of factors such as composition and subject matter. \nUMMA has partnered with CMCA for the presentation of this two-venue exhibition; CMCA’s show will be mounted in November on the second floor of Dowling Walsh Gallery in Rockland. The selections offer a glimpse into the richness and breadth of Brown’s vision as a collector and showcase the diversity of approaches explored by Maine-based photographers. The UMMA exhibition features images by Joyce Tenneson, David Brooks Stess, Todd Watts, Judy Glickman Lauder, Kris Larson and David Hilliard, among others. \nAlso on view at UMMA through the end of the year are “Paul Myoda,” sculptures in the Zillman Gallery; and “Traer Scott: Natural History,” diorama-inspired digital images. UMMA is open Mondays through Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is free in 2015, thanks to the generosity of Penobscot Financial Advisors.
