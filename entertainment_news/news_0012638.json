In an interview BIFA artistic director Nkululeko Nkala said all is in place for the festival. \n“Everything is set for the festival which this year has managed to attract big names in the entertainment circles. There will be performances from children from primary schools in Beitbridge who will be competing in traditional dance,” he said. \n‘‘There are also going to be two bands from Midlands State University to take part and this time around the festival will be a mixed bag. Comedy and theatre are also part of the festival.” \nNkala, however, bemoaned lack of funds saying this has resulted in their failure to attract international acts to the festival. \n“Despite attracting big names locally, we failed to cater for the international aspect of the festival because of finances but we are looking forward to bring international acts in the future,” he said. \nHe highlighted that this year’s festival will be running under the theme “Big Art, Small town”. \n“Despite Beitbridge being a small town, we have managed to bring big art hence the theme ‘Big Art, Small Town’,” he said. \nNkala added that this year’s festival will see Beitbridge Got Talent finals also taking place. Winky D will be the closing act tonight, while tomorrow Judgment yard will be the closing act and Peter Moyo will close the festival on Saturday. \nBifa was established with the idea of celebrating, appreciating and encouraging artistic excellence in all art works. The event features an array of activities, chief among them music, dance, theatre, arts workshops, spoken word, fashion and modelling. Its mission is to sell Beitbridge as Zimbabwe’s growing town while promoting local artists and encouraging collaborations with international acts. \nIn Kariba, residents are set to be treated to a lifetime event as the inaugural Kariba Music festival gathers momentum. The two-day festival that will be held at Nyamunga Primary School begins on Saturday. \nThe festival that begins in the afternoon will see musicians Mathias Mhere, Spirit Praise, Shinsoman and Spiderman performing. Local musicians such as Afro Voice will have a chance to showcase their talents at the festival. \nNot only musicians will showcase their talent as poets and crafters will also have a chance to show their works at the festival. \nOrganisers of the event said they have decided to have the festival held in Kariba for the first time. \n“Festivals are being held all over the country and it is good for us to have such events in areas like Kariba that are far away from Harare that hosts most events” he said. \nHe said they have decided to have several artists to give fans a variety. \n“Such festivals are good enough to allow cultural integration and give residents entertainment,” he said. \nSpirit Praise choir director Learmore Tavengwa said they were happy to be invited to perform at the festival. \n“Such festivals are useful to us as a group because we have the chance to showcase our music to the people as well as interacting with fellow musicians,” he said. \nTheir last album “Nguva Yatokwana” was well received by music lovers. He said they will be performing songs such as “Nguva Yatokwana”, “Anodaira” and “Makanaka” at the event. More is expected from Shinsoman who is set to unleash his album this week. \nHis manager Chief Chiyangwa said they welcome the festival that contributes to the development of the arts industry. \n“We have a new album that will be released this week. Such festivals are good as they give artistes a chance to interact and perform for fans,” he said. \nThere will be a festival after-party that will be held at ZV Hotel in Kariba with Shinsoman and Spiderman performing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:33:40.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
