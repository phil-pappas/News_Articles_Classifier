Proposals that accumulate the most supporters are ranked at the top of the list, where they are in the best position to capture the attention of film producers and executives.\nSince its debut at BookCon 2014, The IF List has over 120,000 registered users, including 300 best-selling authors who are interested in seeing their books get adapted into movies or TV shows. Jamie McGuire (Beautiful Disaster), Lauren Oliver (Before I Fall), Lissa Price (Starters), Colleen Hoover (Ugly Love), Marissa Meyer (The Lunar Chronicles) and Sylvain Reynard (Gabriel’s Inferno) are among the novelists who have used The IF List to garner support for their stories. Many of them have gone to social media and posted messages on their websites, encouraging fans to vote and submit casting ideas on The IF List.\nThe concept of online movie casting is not entirely new. “Throughout internet blogs, editorials and forums, fans as well as authors and journalists have been proposing popular books and dream-casting actors in movies, but there has been no way to quantify these opinions and data, which can be critical when negotiating film deals,” says CEO Benny Hung. “That’s why we created The IF List. It offers a fun, interactive and consolidated platform, while providing the statistics and endorsements that can be valuable marketing tools for authors.”\nDescribed by some users as “Goodreads meets IMDB,” The IF List houses a visual database of stories, characters, actors and filmmakers. Users can cast actors and nominate directors for the stories they would like to see made into movies or TV shows. On the flip side, actors and directors can also propose themselves and elicit fan support. There are currently over 2.6 million votes cast on The IF List.\nAbout The IF List\nFounded by Benny Hung, Ian Spangler and Noel Spangler in 2013, The IF List is a website committed to becoming a vital resource for the entertainment and publishing industries, while empowering readers to creatively engage in the stories they love.\nFor more information, please email press@iflist.com, call (646) 315-4451 or visit www.iflist.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T06:24:37.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
