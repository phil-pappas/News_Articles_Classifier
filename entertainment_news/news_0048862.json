By Mitch Dyer \nDICE Los Angeles has lived as a support studio at Electronic Arts since it was founded in 2013, but it’s \"highly likely\" we’ll see the studio leading its own projects soon, EA Studios Executive Vice President Patrick Soderlund told IGN. \n\"When you start something new, sometimes it's actually good for them to test the waters, try a couple of explanation packs,\" Soderlund told IGN. \"You've got to have a good idea for a great game before you can make a game, and that takes time.\" \nVisceral worked on Battlefield 4 expansions to learn the Frostbite Engine tools before it had its own idea in Battlefield Hardline , for example. DICE LA may be on a similar track as the current manager of Battlefield 4. \nSoderlund said of DICE LA, \"They’ve really not only created good stuff, they have taken over Battlefield 4…and done a great job with BF4 since the launch of it. They've built great expansion packs, but more importantly they've created an identity for us in LA.\" \nEA CEO Andrew Wilson added, \"I have no doubt that DICE LA will be building their game at some [point], because it's a really, really passionate group of people.\" \nIf you visit the studio today, Soderlund explained, it's bright, it's happy, it's a very different vibe down there, and that, to me, it takes time to build something like that. When you have that you can then say, 'Now it's time for you guys to do something else.' I think you'll see more from them in the future.\" \nMitch Dyer is an Editor at IGN.
