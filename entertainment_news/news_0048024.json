In the new preview, we see Cannavale's character describing what rock music felt like in the 70s: \"It's fast. It's dirty. It smashes you over the head.\" Which may also be a way to describe the new eight-episode drama that also stars Olivia Wilde, Juno Temple, and Ray Romano. From Martin Scorsese, Mick Jagger and Terence Winter, this new drama series is set in 1970s New York. A ride through the sex- and drug-addled music business at the dawn of punk, disco, and hip-hop, the show is seen through the eyes of a record label president, Richie Finestra, played by Bobby Cannavale, who is trying to save his company and his soul without destroying everyone in his path. Vinyl stars Bobby Cannavale, Olivia Wilde, Juno Temple, Ray Romano, Paul Ben-Victor, Ato Essandoh, Andrew Dice Clay, Max Casella, P.J. Byrne, J.C. MacKenzie, Birgitte Hjort Sorensen, Jack Quaid, James Jagger Release: January, 2016 (on HBO)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:54:35.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
