If the contract is ratified, the strike would end. While Kinshofer wouldnâ€™t discuss the details of the negotiations, he confirmed the contract was a three-year deal.\nThe 152 educators on strike had been seeking raises of 1.36 percent for each of two years, plus annual step increases averaging 3.63 percent, union spokeswoman Heidie Dunn previously said.\nSchools in the district remained closed for seven days during the strike, and all extracurricular activities for the 2,650 students, including sports and clubs, had been canceled.\nHomecoming events scheduled for this weekend had been called off as well, though the homecoming dance will be rescheduled, the school district said on its website. Administrators plan to meet with student leadership groups as soon as school resumes so that they can provide input on revisions to the school calendar and rescheduling missed activities.\n Unions Educators", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561928f1/turbine/ct-officials-reach-tentative-agreement-in-mchenry-school-strike-20151010"], "published": "2015-10-10T18:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:07:40.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
