This week, the master satirists turned their attention to the issue of social media shaming — particularly \"body shaming\" — and the celebrities who publicly claim to have been affected by it.\nIn the episode, titled \"Safe Space,\" Cartman manipulates his school principal into forcing Butters to read through all of his social media comments and edit out all the mean ones. That way Cartman can publicly post shirtless pictures of himself online without having to read any negative comments about his body. Butters is so good at his new job that the principal forces him to edit more peoples' the social media comments, including celebrities Lena Dunham, Demi Lovato, and a group of plus-size lingerie models.\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail Getty Comedy Central Share Tweet Pin E-mail Comedy Central / Lane Bryant Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Meanwhile, South Park adult Randy Marsh launches an anti-shaming charity and hosts a star-studded gala fundraiser dinner where he introduces the keynote speaker as, \"​a woman who knows about shaming first hand: supermodel Gigi Hadid.\"\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail Getty Comedy Central More From Cosmopolitan As Gigi begins her speech dressed in nothing but black lingerie, Randy is informed that Reality — an old-timey-looking villain with a top hat, cape, and black moustache — is trying to crash the party. \"Reality? Who let him in!\" Randy exclaims.\nSeconds later, Reality rushes the stage, snatching the mic from Gigi. \"Give me that, you stupid bitch,\" he says. \"What a lovely charity event. I suppose you're all feeling pretty good about yourselves. What have you done? You've raised $300 by spending half a million on fillet mignon and crystal glasses. Look at you, Vin Dipshit! You say fat shaming is wrong so in response you show off your abs. You're the one fat-shaming, you idiot!What's the matter with you people? You're sad that people are mean? Well I'm sorry. The world isn't one big liberal arts college campus. We eat too much. We take our spoiled lives for granted. Feel a little bad about it sometimes! No. You wanna put all your shit up on the internet and have every single person say 'hooray' for you. Fuck you! You're all pricks!\"\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail Comedy Central, Instagram @vindiesel For a minute, it looks like the people of South Park and their special celebrity guests, might actually be taking what Reality has to tell them seriously, especially after he reveals that Butters was driven insane by reading all their negative comments and tried to kill himself. Instead, they decide to execute Reality by hanging him in the center of town.\nTalk about shutting down your haters!", "external_links": ["http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/640x320/gallery-1445643063-kjsdgbszdkjb.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/768x384/gallery-1445643063-kjsdgbszdkjb.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/1445643183-ksdhgvsgnv.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/1600x800/landscape-1445643063-kjsdgbszdkjb.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/480x240/gallery-1445643063-kjsdgbszdkjb.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/1600x800/landscape-1445643273-dghusor.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/768x768/gallery-1445643183-ksdhgvsgnv.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/1600x800/gallery-1445643063-kjsdgbszdkjb.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/980x980/gallery-1445643183-ksdhgvsgnv.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/640x320/gallery-1445643273-dghusor.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/1600x800/landscape-1445643116-dytjdjmdhj.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/768x384/gallery-1445643116-dytjdjmdhj.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/480x480/gallery-1445643183-ksdhgvsgnv.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/640x640/gallery-1445643183-ksdhgvsgnv.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/1600x800/gallery-1445643273-dghusor.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/980x490/gallery-1445643063-kjsdgbszdkjb.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/1280x640/gallery-1445643116-dytjdjmdhj.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/768x384/gallery-1445643273-dghusor.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/980x490/gallery-1445643116-dytjdjmdhj.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/640x320/gallery-1445643116-dytjdjmdhj.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/640x320/landscape-1445643183-ksdhgvsgnv.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/480x240/gallery-1445643273-dghusor.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/980x490/gallery-1445643273-dghusor.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/1600x800/gallery-1445643116-dytjdjmdhj.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/1280x640/gallery-1445643273-dghusor.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/1280x640/gallery-1445643063-kjsdgbszdkjb.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/480x240/gallery-1445643116-dytjdjmdhj.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-26T03:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T05:19:23.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
