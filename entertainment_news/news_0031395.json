(Photo by Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images)[/caption]While big tech initiatives are easy to find during New York and London Fashion Weeks , once the month-long slog of back-to-back catwalk shows hits Milan and then Paris, little more follows.Indeed the greatest news so far has been about the selfies on the Dolce & Gabbana catwalk. Short of anything else to write about, that got substantial press coverage, loads of social media sharing and even some tech blogs to boot.This was about models walking the runway shooting photos of themselves via their phones in hand (as you can see pictured here). Those same images were then displayed on large screens around the Italian village-themed venue in real-time, as well as shared via Dolce & Gabbana’s own social media channels.[caption id=\"attachment_505\" align=\"\" width=\"650\"] Selfies on Dolce & Gabbana's Instagram account during Milan Fashion Week spring/summer 2016[/caption]My social media feed, however, was then filled with people virtually rolling their eyes (if only there was an emoji for that). Not because it wasn’t cute – it was – but because it wasn’t new. Frankly, it’s a little mind blowing that it therefore got so much attention.To put into context, “selfie” gained entry into The Oxford English Dictionary in November 2013. A year ago, Android users alone were taking over 93 million selfies per day, and selfies were making up a third of all shots taken by people aged 18-24. I imagine both those figures to be wildly out of date and significantly higher by now – the popularity of the selfie stick undoubtedly in part to blame.Selfies as a concept have accordingly been used by fashion brands and retailers around the world for advertising campaigns ( Dolce & Gabbana included ), for real-world marketing in store windows, and for user-generated content pushes ever since. And very successfully so. In fact, from a conversion rate standpoint, brands using images of consumers wearing the same products as those shown on specific e-commerce pages are seeing up to 4.5x the sell-through rate, according to visual commerce platform Olapic.[caption id=\"attachment_490261594\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] Selfies on the Dolce & Gabbana runway at Milan Fashion Week spring/summer 2016. (Photo by GIUSEPPE CACACE/AFP/Getty Images)[/caption]Selfies make sales it seems. That said, fatigue has inevitably followed from every retailer constantly asking us to post our own pictures with a hashtag. With it no longer new, the noise surrounding such “contests” is increasingly overwhelming.The fashion week idea is not a new one either. Kenneth Cole sent models down the runway with phones in February 2013 , requesting that they snapped both the audience and themselves in order to share their point of view.In February 2014, supermodel Cara Delevingne then took what was heralded as the first-ever catwalk selfie video series at the Giles show in London (pictured below), which she posted directly to her own Instagram feed. And a year ago, the same occurred again at the Libertine show in New York when models threw somewhat of a selfie party as they took to their finale walks.[caption id=\"attachment_498\" align=\"\" width=\"650\"] Cara Delevingne taking a selfie video on the Giles runway at London Fashion Week fall/winter 2014/15[/caption]In fact, you could even go so far as to say that selfies are now enormously out of fashion. Google the term this week for instance, and the main themes that come up surround how many people have died while taking selfies (more than those killed by sharks this year, though the risk ratio is vastly different according to Forbes’ Alex Knapp ), and thus lots of warnings against doing so around things like sheer cliff faces, wild animals and loaded weapons.But back to fashion... If anything, when it comes to digital progress, Dolce & Gabbana’s use of selfies, as endearing as they were, only served to highlight the fact Milan (and Paris) are still significantly behind their other fashion week counterparts. In many instances, these are brands with strictly scheduled content plans in place months in advance – down to the copy of a tweet – and there’s little space to maneuver let alone truly innovate.[caption id=\"attachment_504\" align=\"\" width=\"650\"] Selfies on Dolce & Gabbana's Instagram account during Milan Fashion Week spring/summer 2016[/caption]There have of course been some great things coming out of both cities, and Paris particularly still wins when it comes to theatrical catwalk shows that capture the imagination of audiences both in attendance and at home, season after season. But giving so much attention to selfie-snapping models is merely proof that we’re still blinded by the quirky and the gimmicky, celebrating them as though they’re fresh, digitally-savvy and yes even innovative, when that’s exactly what is missing from these cities.Kudos to Dolce & Gabbana for doing something fun, entertaining the crowd, and having the ability to still gain column inches amid such noise based on something that really is quite dated. Let’s just not get carried away with the idea this is at all progressive.[youtubevid id=\"CqusBYOcaA4 \"]", "external_links": ["http://fashionista.com/2015/06/dolce-gabbana-fall-2015-campaign", "http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/490383156/640x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://instagram.com/p/kh0kmODKBX/?taken-by=caradelevingne", "http://www.nylon.com/articles/nyfw-2014-libertine-model-selfies-gallery", "https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151239471366502.453935.9291921501&type=1", "http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/490261594/640x0.jpg?fit=scale"], "published": "2015-10-02T18:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:04:49.081+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
