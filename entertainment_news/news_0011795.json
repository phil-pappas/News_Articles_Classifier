I have a fibroid. I don't even feel it, but supposedly it's exactly where an egg would get implanted. I don't have enough eggs left to mess around and try it naturally and see what happens. I'll need help.

You signed a contract. You cannot just now, because you hate the other person, be like, 'No, that's not what I wanted.' I'm sorry, but when we decided, we decided. It's not like anybody was drinking or anything. He knew what he was doing, and now suddenly it's like ... So we're just waiting to see. I don't think it's going to go anywhere.\" bang showbiz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T11:51:49.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
