Fox as Marty McFly in the 1985 film, \"Back to the Future.\" Wednesday's so-called \"Back to the Future\" Day marks the date: Oct. 21, 2015, that characters McFly, Brown and Jennifer Parker famously journeyed to the future in the film trilogy's second installment in 1989. In recognition of the day, Austria’s transport ministry is ready with guidelines for hoverboards, and has issued tongue-in-cheek rules on their use to mark “Back to the Future” day. (Universal Pictures Home Entertainment via AP, File) Sponsored Links The Associated Press VIENNA — \nIt's the day that Marty McFly landed in the future — and Austria's transport ministry is ready with guidelines for hoverboards. \nFans of \"Back to the Future 2\" know that McFly arrived on Oct. 21, 2015 — Wednesday. They also will remember the hoverboard sequence, with McFly being chased by Biff and his gang, all on flying skateboards. \nThese may never go beyond the prototype stage. But the ministry has issued tongue-in-cheek rules on their use to mark \"Back to the Future\" day. Its website describes a hoverboard as a \"small vehicle for use outside of the road\" and says a special license is needed for rocket-driven \"Pit Bull\" models. \nIt urges hoverboarders to wear helmets and to \"be aware ... of possible additional regulations\" for use over water.
