Seth Rogen's idea of Christmas involves lots of drugs, even more vomiting and even Kanye karaoke.The reunion of 50/50's Rogen and Gordon-Levitt sees them meet up with childhood pal Mackie for a night of merriment in New York City on Christmas Eve. Sounds like a recipe for disaster!Not to be outdone, funny ladies Lizzy Caplan, Mindy Kaling and Jillian Bell get in on the action as the festivities spiral totally out of control.All this bad behaviour aside, at least The Night Before isn't going to cause an international incident… like Seth's last holiday release.The Night Before opens on November 20 in the US and December 4 in the UK.
