Jay Z, Beyonce, others perform at Tidal concert in NYC Associated Press | \nNEW YORK (AP) — Jay Z and Beyonce were joined by a slew of artists including Nicki Minaj and Usher at Barclays Center in Brooklyn on Tuesday night for a charity concert put on by the streaming service Tidal that covered rap, R&B, reggae and even a little country. \nThe concert, \"TIDAL X: 1020 Amplified by HTC,\" was a little like streaming a musical hit parade, as most of the artists only sang one song, and even major stars like Jay Z and Beyonce kept to short sets. The goal of the event was to raise funds that would be given to the New World Foundation, an organization that funds social movements.
