The 23-year-old songstress admits in a new interview that the dating app scares her despite being very popular, additionally noting that says she is enjoying her single life right now and focusing on her singing career. \"I would never go on Tinder! I think it would scare me. I go on dates,\" she reveals in her cover story for Flare magazine's latest issue. \"It's not that difficult - I'm a nice young lady. But that's not my focus. I'm really stoked about being with myself right now.\" A photo posted by FLARE Magazine (@flaremag) on Oct 1, 2015 at 6:30am PDT \"This has been a transitional season for me, personally and in my career. I had multiple revelations and big accomplishments in my life,\" she says. \"I'm young: I've lived my life in the public eye, and I've had to figure out how to do that. Ultimately, I am 23 and figuring out my life. I feel confident, I feel empowered, I feel in control.\" \"My strength is translating emotion, because I'm such a feeler,\" Selena explains. \"I've felt so much in the past two years, from being super in love and then dealing with things to getting older and all these beautiful experiences that were complicated and exciting. That's what I wanted the record to feel like.\" During the process of finishing the album, \"I was getting criticized because I had gained weight. I was really bummed when I found out all that stuff was going on, and that's when I was like, 'I'm so tired of feeling like I'm being pulled down by something,' \" she opens up. \" 'Revival' is the first song on the album, and the first lines are, 'I feel like I've awakened - the chains around me are finally breaking.' \" To other girls dealing with the same criticism online, Selena says, \"None of it is real, not even the comments. It's especially hard for women and girls, who think they have to look like those pictures; that breaks my heart. I know I post pictures when I feel good or look good in an outfit, but in reality, I'm not going to be posing like that as I'm walking down the street, and you can Google horrible pictures of me. You can find them everywhere. I don't care. Social media is a place to have fun and put your perspective online.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:28:07.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
