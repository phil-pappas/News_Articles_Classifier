Are you sure it's Amazon Prime and not Amazon past-their-prime?\"\nBut Clarkson was happy to make jokes at his own expense, the Radio Times said, once insisting he was forbidden to discuss motoring matters.\nHe said: \"I can't talk about cars on the BBC. I can't say the C-word.\"\nShare article Clarkson was suspended by the broadcaster on March 10 after punching Mr Tymon during a row over a steak dinner, before the BBC announced his contract would not be renewed.\nThe new series of Have I Got News For You begins at 9pm today on BBC 1.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-03T00:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:15:53.642+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
