But both shows are tied among the youngest adults, ages 18 to 34, among whom Colbert has grown nearly threefold over Letterman.\nAlthough Colbert is well off the 6.6 million who tuned in for his premiere, \"We could not be more pleased with the way the show's doing,\" says CBS research chief David Poltrack, adding that 39 million viewers have watched at least one episode. The network's research reveals that viewers perceive it as a funny \"thinking person's show, which is what the goal was. And it's distinctive in that regard\" compared to other late-night shows.\n'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert' welcomed 'Late Late Show' host James Corden for a recent taping.

Kimmel's audience is down 9%, to 2.3 million viewers, a distant third place, and has fallen 15% among adults, to 667,000 â€” less than half of Fallon's total. And both ESPN and Adult Swim, among the most popular networks for the youngest adults, are also down this fall.\nDespite Colbert's gains, the Late Show remains the oldest-skewing late-night show: Its viewers' median age is 58 (down from 60.4 for Letterman), compared to 57.3 for Kimmel and 54.3 for Fallon.\nIn the 12:35 a.m. ET/PT slot, both NBC's Seth Meyers and CBS's James Corden have gained ground from last fall: Meyers' Late Night gained a slight 2%, to 1.7 million viewers (and bested Kimmel among young adults, though it airs an hour later), while Corden's Late Late Show averaged 1.4 million up 5% from predecessor Craig Ferguson's four-week average.\nOver on cable, Comedy Central has suffered without Colbert and Jon Stewart. The first two weeks of The Daily Show with Trevor Noah claimed an average of 942,000 same-day viewers, down from 1.5 million for the equivalent weeks with Jon Stewart last September. Noah's audience among adults 18 to 49 fell 43%.\nNew Host of 'The Daily Show' Trevor Noah is in the guest chair of 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert' in September. (Photo: Jeffrey R. Staab, CBS)\nWhile the median age of Noah's viewers is 46.7, older than Stewart's 43.1, Comedy Central president Michele Ganeless says she expects that adults 18-34, the core fan base of Noah, 31, is more likely to watch the show or its segments on other platforms.\n2 CONNECT 10 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT //usat.ly/1RFzDJm TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fd106a3bc897ded29cec64d38cdf4dbb1a83e356/c=78-0-1923-1387&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/635802727834097396-107107-D0180bc.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RFzDJm&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/25/USATODAY/USATODAY/635787749784665395-COLBERT-LEDE.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/09/25/USATODAY/USATODAY/635787749784665395-COLBERT-LEDE.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c476a95e71592cac2a686cbf45f6aed045da4746/c=337-0-5678-4016&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/25/USATODAY/USATODAY/635787749784665395-COLBERT-LEDE.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RFzDJm&text=Colbert%20shakes%20up%20late-night%20race%20but%20Fallon%20remains%20tops&via=usatoday", "http://usat.ly/1RFzDJm", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/271ec7483a90a3fe241ee7e67f5a44cce9142de5/c=9-0-1509-2000&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/10/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/635802705959949178-107259-0733s.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-13T23:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:54:18.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
