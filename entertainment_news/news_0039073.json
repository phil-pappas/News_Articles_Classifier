Since Kim and professional partner Tony Dovolani couldn’t deliver due to medical reasons, host Tom Bergeron announced the show’s rules which stated they were to withdraw. The dancing couple then turned to social media to campaign for a chance to return, but in the meantime, the week’s show went on. Season 19 mirrorball champion Alfonso Ribeiro returned to the ballroom as a guest judge, along with a brief cameo from Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog. TV theme songs provided the music for the 10 remaining couples, who performed challenging character-inspired choreography for the panel’s score. Nick Carter and Sharna Burgess tied Alexa PenaVega and Mark Ballas at the top of the leaderboard with a 36/40 after a flawless waltz to Downton Abbey’s theme song that Carrie Ann Inaba said took Nick “from pop artist to classical virtuoso.” Alexa and Mark’s jazz number to Breaking Bad’s soundtrack earned praise from the former winner. \"You two can win,\" Alfonso declared. Next week, things get emotional when the dancers tackle their most memorable year. \nShelton blown away by talent: \nNotable knockout Vocalists solidified their place amongst the budding superstar-monitored teams when the second week of blind auditions impressed on The Voice. “I’m blown away by the talent this season,” Blake Shelton stated before he and his celebrity coach peers began their tug-of-war for the most promising four-chair turns. Oklahoma couple and country duo, Jubal and Amanda hit the stage first and performed The Eagles’ hit Seven Bridges Road, a song written by Jubal’s father Steve Young. Following their pleasing performance, Jubal abruptly got down on one knee and proposed to his partner onstage, as the judges cheered in amazement. After the surprise engagement, the couple picked Pharrell as their coach. “We got the coach we wanted and I got the girl I wanted,” Jubal beamed. But Pharrell wasn’t the only coach to score a talented singing duo, when Adam Levine won over the approval of 23-year-old twin sisters Andi and Alex . With masterful harmonies to a gorgeous folk rendition of Dido’s classic Thank You, the twin sisters triggered an immediate four-chair turn that had the coaches scrambling. When Adam pulled out the stops calling them “lightening in a bottle” and promised to take them to the end of the competition, their choice was sealed. To end the week, each coach claimed ten artists for their promising teams leading into the final round of blind auditions next week. \nOld clothes bring back old memories: \nFrom Armenia to Jerusalem to the Billboard Music Awards, the Kardashian and Jenner sisters had a lot on their extravagant schedules during this week’s episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians. After Kanye West performed a headline-making surprise show in Armenia that saw the famous rapper jump in the lake, it was time for KimYe and Khloe to make their way to Jerusalem, where North West was baptized in the oldest Armenian Church in the country. Back at home, anxiety mounted for youngest sister Kylie Jenner while she prepared for the Billboard awards, only to be triggered further after finding out that the family’s About Bruce special would air the same night. After nearly fainting on the red carpet without Kendall Jenner by her side, Kylie ditched her interviews out of fear of questions on Caitlyn’s transition and her controversial lips. And to round out the episode, Kim visited Caitlyn to collect Bruce’s old clothes to give to her mother, who was struggling with her transition. “I realized that I still have a long way to go before I can process all of this,” Kris said. “It’s just crazy that he’s gone.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:12:20.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
