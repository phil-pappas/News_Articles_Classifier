Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Join the Conversation A review of pizza places in Santa Rosa and Escambia counties. Sponsored by October: National Pizza Month The Elbow Room - Life Changer Pizza Pro 1: The Life Changer pizza is not on the menu, but the bartender swears it's his favorite. Cream cheese cubes, bacon, jalapenos and pineapple may or may not sound appetizing, but the pizza is darn good. I didn't love the first bite, but I acquired the taste with every slice and grew to love it by the time I was done. It was created by a former employee who moved off to San Francisco for a life change, hence the name. The Elbow Room , 2213 W. Cervantes St., Pensacola. Hours of operation 4 p.m. to 2 a.m. Tuesday to Friday and 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. Saturdays. Phone: 434-0300. October: National Pizza Month Hopjacks Pizza Kitchen & Taproom - Butcher Block Pizza Pro 1: I'm not a fan of meat on pizza. I have nothing against meats, I just don't like it on pizza because I find it overpowers the taste. The Butcher Block from Hopjacks was nice because the meat flavor is there, but it's more like a strong backup singer, rather than an overpowering guitar solo. Pizza Pro 2: Credit Hopjacks for putting three of God's greatest creations - smoked bacon, filet mignon and pepperoni - on a pizza. For meat lovers like me, the Butcher Block belongs in the Pizza Hall of Fame. Yes, there really is one. Pizza Pro 3: As far as pizza goes, I'm not much for sausage or mushrooms. I was hesitant to try the Butcher's Block because I thought it might be laden with grizzly sausage hunks and I wouldn't be able to focus on the other flavors of the pizza. I was wrong, and happily so. Hopjacks, 10 S. Palafox & 204 E. Nine Mile Road, Pensacola. Hours of operation 11 a.m. to 3 a.m. Phone: Palafox location - 497-6073; Nine Mile Road location - 912-6181 October: National Pizza Month Sky's Pizza Pie - Cheese slice Pizza Pro 1: I'm from upstate New York, I lived in Boston for almost six years, and I've visited friends and family in New York City many times. This means I have a closet full of winter clothes I no longer use... and I'm one heck of a pizza snob. I was excited from online reviews that Sky's had New York style pizza. So I ordered two slices of cheese, hoping it would take me back to a place where the winters are long and the pizza is good... I was disappointed. DISCLAIMER: I am the only person I've met who is not in love with Sky's, so feel free to ignore me and enjoy the rest of your day. Sky's Pizza Pie, 5559 N. Davis Highway, Pensacola. Hours of operation, 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday to Thursday and 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday. Phone: 477-4424 October: National Pizza Month Ozone Pizza Pub - Ponderosa Stomp Pizza Pro 1: I may or may not decide to have a medium of their Italian Flag pizza buried with me when I die since I love it only slightly less than I do my dog and only slightly more than I do my Xbox. In this case, I tried the Ponderosa Stomp, which is a legit pizza. Not as good as the Italian Flag, but pretty good, nonetheless. Pizza Pro 2: OK, so I detest onions, but they were relatively easy to pick off, and once I tossed them in the trash can where they belong, the Ponderosa Stomp hit the spot. The crust, sauce and cheese were all fantastic. I would never choose the Ponderosa Stomp over the Carnivore, but it was tastier than I expected. Pizza Pro 3: I'm willing to bet if God was going to choose a pizza to serve in heaven, he'd pick the Ponderosa Stomp. Tender pieces of chicken, bbq sauce, bacon, green onions, jalapenos, cheddar, and drizzle of sweet East Hill Honey along on top. Cream cheese and cashews are also a suggested option. This pizza is the perfect combination of tangy, savory, salty and sweet. It's colorful. It's delicious. It's inventive. And it's damn near perfect. Ozone Pizza Pub : 1010 N. 12th Ave., Pensacola. Hours of operation, 11 a.m. to midnight Monday to Saturday and 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday. Phone: 433-7336 October: National Pizza Month Georgio's Pizza: House Special Pizza Pro 1: I ordered the House Special from Georgio's. It's a good pizza, don't get me wrong, but I'm not a fan of meat toppings. So I, personally, should have ordered something else. That being said, it's good. The crust is a little thicker than I'd like, but I'd gladly eat this again. It's the most visually appealing pizza I've reviewed so far. Georgio's Pizza , 300 E. Cervantes St. Pensacola.Hours of operation11 a.m. to 10 p..m Friday and Saturday, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Sunday to Thursday. Phone: 432-5993 October: National Pizza Month New York Deli - New Yorker Special Pizza Pro 2: Let me preface this by saying New York Deli is one of my favorite dining establishments. Their sandwiches and soup of the day never disappoint. Its popular New Yorker Special is not for me and my bland taste buds, though. I found myself picking off the olives and onions. There wasn't much left when I was done dissecting it, although the cheese made it worthwhile. Pizza Pro 3: I love The New Yorker Deli, so when the staff recommended the New York Special as one of their most popular pies, so I willingly accepted the suggestion. This pizza had just about everything on it, a \"supreme\" pizza in a way - pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, black olives, red and green bell peppers, mozzarella, tomatoes, and red sauce atop a nice hand tossed crust. I felt like the pizza should have had little something more on it, or maybe something less. It wasn't bad, but for me, there wasn't anything special about it. New York Deli , 3001 E Cervantes St., Pensacola. Hours of operation, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday to Saturday. Closed on Sunday. Phone: 469-0029. October: National Pizza Month Seville Quarter - The Primo Pizza Pro 2: One of my favorite pizza chains in Indiana is Pizza King. The pizza is cut into squares on thin crust, so that you're practically eating pizza toppings on a cracker. Seville Quarter's The Primo is cut into pie shape, but the pizza tastes similar with its super thin crust. The Primo is a meat lover's dream with a double layer of sausage, pepperoni and mozzarella. The pizza is worth the trip as are dozens of other items on the Seville menu. Guest Pizza Pro: The Primo Pizza is definitely the kind of pizza I would eat after a night of bar hopping with friends. It has great portions for the cost. Anytime you can double pepperoni and sausage I'm always down. I've had better and worse in Pensacola, not too bad all around for the price you're paying. Seville Quarter , 130 E. Government St., Pensacola. Hours of operation: 7 a.m. to 3 a.m. 434-6211 October: National Pizza Month Founaris Bros - Feta cheese & spinach pizza Pizza Pro 1: I was surprised at how much I loved this pizza since I normally wouldn't get fetta and spinach as toppings. As you get closer to the crust there is more marinara sauce, which was delicious. The last couple of bites are the best because of that sauce, so I wish there was more throughout. It's a deeper dish pizza, which I usually don't always like, so this was a pleasant discovery all around. Pizza Pro 2: After my first bite of the spinach and feta cheese topped Founaris Bro. pizza, I thought, this is OK. Nothing special. A couple minutes later, I realized I had just scarfed down my third piece. The feta cheese and crisp crust were the best parts of the pizza. The sauce was good to, but I wish there was more of it. Pizza Pro 3: Because this pizza was coming from a Greek restaurant, I was hoping it would contain copious amounts of feta. It did, and I was happy. I like spinach on a pizza, if only to provide a nice mix of color and the ability to argue later that I incorporated vegetables into my meal.The pizza had a red sauce, and I think the flavors might have complimented more by a white or a garlic sauce. The crust was really doughy, but crispy around the edges. Founaris Bros. Greek Rest. , 6911 Pensacola Blvd., Pensacola. Hours: 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday to Thursday and 11 a.m.-9 p.m. Saturday. 969-9099 Pensacola News Journal 12:16 p.m. CDT October 10, 2015 Buy Photo Helen Back in Navarre's Traditional Top Line Pizza (Photo: PNJ Pizza Pro) Buy Photo CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE October is National Pizza month - and throughout the month, a select team of PNJ Pizza Pros will be checking out Pensacola-area pizzerias in search of the area's best pies. At the end of the month, each of our judges will name their Top 3 area favorites. \nHere is today's short and sweet review: \nHELEN BACK - TRADITIONAL TOP LINE & MEAT LOVERS \nPizza Pro 1: Well worth the drive on a Saturday afternoon, Helen Back is on the water and flags from the country’s major college sports programs hang from the high ceiling. I ordered the Traditional Top Line pizza which has pepperoni, mushrooms, onions and black olives. The soft crust and overall balanced taste goes well with a draft beer and the many televisions available for football games. \nGuest Pizza Pro: When it comes to pizza, I need meat. Lots and lots of meat. Helen Back delivers with its Meat Lovers pizza. Piled high with pepperoni, sausage, meatballs and - my favorite - smoked bacon, it was just what I had hoped for. The savory sauce and handtossed crust brought it all together perfectly. Throw in a couple super cold beers and college football, Helen Back delivers a winning experience. \nHelen Back, Navarre , 8651 Navarre Parkway, Hours of operation: 11 a.m. to 12 a.m. daily. \nGET IN ON THE FUN \nWe want to hear from you.
