But starting at midnight last Tuesday, he set out to test the very limits of friendship and human endurance. \n\"No sleep breaks,\" Satterwhite said. \nTo raise money for the fight against breast cancer, the longtime karaoke host chose to sing the same Garth Brooks song, Friends in Low Places, continuously for 36 hours at Stars Bar and Grill in Federal Way. \n\"I wouldn't even call myself a singer,\" Satterwhite said. \"I like to sing.\" \nHe gave it his best, in honor of his dear friend, Smitti, whose real name is Sondra Holliday. \nSatterwhite explained, \"She's just a great inspiration to me.\" \nA two-time cancer survivor, Smitti is a fighter left battered but never beaten. \n\"It hasn't stopped her,\" Satterwhite said. \nEven the other singers here on karaoke night couldn't put him off his pace. Cliff just slipped off to the back and kept on singing. \n\"Gave me a makeshift cot in case there's a failure to launch,\" he laughed. \"But I'm pretty sure I won't have to use that cot.\" \nThe power of friendship and love carried Cliff right over the finish line. But he probably won't be singing that song again anytime soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T05:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T05:39:06.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
