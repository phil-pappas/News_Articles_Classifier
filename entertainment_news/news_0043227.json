The author, a survivor, was inspired to write this book after the death of his sister and the absence of justice.\nPublished by New York City-based Page Publishing, Robert Chiappetta’s poignant tale will keep the reader intrigued through the honest, crime-driven plot.\nAlthough the risk of death and great bodily harm were foreseeable, rather than changing their conduct they chose to run the risk. A sinister gamble virtually assuring death with the greatest possible violence. It is apparent that both corporations had willfully entered into an amoral and criminal quagmire that the law can only begin to address. The children’s mortal wounds are quintessential examples of theocratic and bureaucratic corruption fulfilling their deadly potential.\nReaders who wish to experience this profound work can purchase “The Immaculate Deception” at bookstores everywhere or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708.\nAbout Page Publishing\nPage Publishing is a traditional New York based full-service publishing house that handles all of the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
