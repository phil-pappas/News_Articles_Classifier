The Warner Bros. dramedy, which launched in 2000, has been a strong performer for the streaming service.\n\"Gilmore\" initially ran for seven seasons and 153 episodes on The WB/CW, six of those under Sherman-Palladino before she exited following a contract dispute with the studio. A Netflix revival would be Sherman-Palladino's opportunity to not only return to her own series but also to have the final word.\nSpeaking candidly about the latter during a reunion panel at the Austin TV Festival earlier this year, Sherman-Palladino noted: \"It's always a bummer when you don't get to end it. I had hoped maybe that there would have been a call, 'Hey, it's the last episode, do you want to come back?' And there wasn't. But that's OK, that's not the way it works in Hollywood where there are rules.\"\nRead More Sherman-Palladino: \"Gilmore Girls\" wouldn't happen today\nThough many of the original actors are in talks to return, too, Melissa McCarthy (Sookie St. James) is not expected to be one of them. Since Gilmore wrapped in 2007, McCarthy's career has skyrocketed, with star vehicles on TV (\"Mike & Molly\") and in film (\"The Heat,\" \"Ghostbusters\").\nThe news comes as Netflix preps a revival of Full House, aptly titled \"Fuller House,\" another series that's performed well for the service. It's also said to be working on another season of \"Arrested Development,\" which initially ran on Fox.\nA look back at the \"Gilmore Girls\" reunion\nThough talent deals on \"Gilmore Girls\" are not yet closed, the plan according to one insider, is to start production early next year.\nFall TV firings and changes", "external_links": ["http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/gilmore-girls-reunion-movie-update-800639", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/gilmore-girls-amy-sherman-palladino-800607"], "published": "2015-10-20T18:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:44:25.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
