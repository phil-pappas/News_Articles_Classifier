No, not at the moment. Not at all.\"\n\nThe 47-year old actor said that \"for at least a year or two, I just don't want to think about it.\"\n\n\"I don't know what the next step is. I'm not in discussion with anybody about anything. If I did another Bond movie, it would only be for the money,\" Craig added.\n\nCraig, who played 007 for the first time in 2006, has shot four films in the series; \"Casino Royale\" (2006), \"Quantum of Solace\" (2008), \"Skyfall\" (2012) and \"Spectre\" (2015).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T13:08:58.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
