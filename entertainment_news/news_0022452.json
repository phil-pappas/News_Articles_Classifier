However, many of these ideas never leave the person's mind and some are even taken to the grave.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151002/273609\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151002/273610\nDarcell Walker , a Houston -based lawyer with over 25 years of experience dealing with the legalities of intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and product licensing, identifies three reasons why people do not follow through with their dreams: lack of confidence, lack of knowledge or lack of trust. First, many people do not believe they have an idea that is good enough to become a successful product. Second, some people do not know where to start in the process of developing their ideas. Third, they have no idea whom they can trust to genuinely guide them through the process. For many, the thought of someone else taking their idea constantly haunts them. As a result, they hold on to their idea until someone else comes along with a product based on the same or similar idea, thereby missing out on the success and financial gain they might have achieved had they moved forward.\nWalker's valuable insights help people with new ideas for products and services to develop their ideas. He is the author of Let's Start Developing Your Million $ Idea , an instructional workbook that outlines the various phases of the product development process and the activities that occur during each phase. Laid out in an easy-to-understand format, Let's Start Developing Your Million $ Idea helps individuals create a five-step plan that enables them to begin the process of turning their idea into a reality.\nDarcell Walker holds a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Prairie View A&M University , a master's degree in engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles , a law degree from the University of Texas School of Law, and a master's in divinity from Southern Methodist University . He assists large corporations, small businesses, individuals and churches with matters related to developing and protecting ideas.\nFor more information, contact Walker at 832-724-7150; Email .\n releases/attorney-tells-how-to-stop-burying-your-million-dollar-ideas-and-start-developing-them-now-300154050.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/attorney-tells-how-to-stop-burying-your-million-dollar-ideas-and-start-developing-them-now-300154050.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=PH19023&Transmission_Id=201510051035PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH19023&DateId=20151005", "http://pressreleaseheadlines.com/contact?pid=291618", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151002/273610", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151002/273609"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:48:53.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
