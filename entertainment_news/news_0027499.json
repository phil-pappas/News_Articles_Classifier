Did you know that there is an annual World Series of Beer Pong that is held in Las Vegas, with a grand prize of $65,000? Granted, you might not want to offer up thousands of dollars to your mates, but you certainly want to host a memorable event that offers up plenty of good vibes! \nWhile the World Series might not be within your sights, there is plenty of fun to be had in someone's backyard. Add a pool, cocktails, beers and killer beats and you've got yourself an epic party! However, planning a tournament can be a little bit daunting, especially if you need to spend money on catering for all of your friends. Instead of worrying and emptying your bank account in the process, take a look at the following tips on how to host a killer beer pong tournament. \nEquipment \nLong tables, ping pong balls, plastic cups, sound equipment and score sheets are all part of the planning. If you need to rent equipment, be sure to ask your friends to chip in with the overall costs or simply charge an 'entry fee' to ensure that you make your money back. If you plan on inviting more than just a handful of your best mates, be sure to set up two or three tables. If you're planning on hosting a number of people, you're going to need a fair amount of ping pong balls, cups and score sheets. Rope your mates in to help set up before the tournament begins. \nFood and Drink \nWhen you let people know about the tournament, be sure to ask them to either chip in to buy food and drink or to bring their own. Otherwise, you can include a food cost in the 'entry fee'. Keep in mind that you will need to offer up a variety of different drinks and still buy a keg (or two) to fill the cups for the game. When in doubt, ask your friends to all bring a six-pack of light beer to contribute to the game. It's also important to remember that the ladies don't always like beer and would rather sip on something a little more 'classy'. Be sure to add coolers and sweet wines to your shopping list! \nTip: Don't forget about the charcoal and firelights if you are planning on braaiing any meat. \nDisposable Plates and Cups \nThe last thing that anyone wants to do is wash heaps of dishes after a night of fun and debauchery. Be sure to add disposable cups, plates and cutlery to your list if you want to avoid the big clean-up post-party. Keep in mind that you need two sets of disposable cups - for the tournament and for people's drinks. \nA beer pong tournament is also the perfect opportunity to invite the girl who you've been eyeing. A laid-back, fun social event, where you might stand the chance of winning the game, is the best way in which to impress! Slap on your best casual shirt, make use of a reliable antiperspirant deodorant and let the fragrance lure her towards you. Don't forget to be a gentleman though, and offer her a drink.
