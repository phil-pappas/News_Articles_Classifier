(Getty Images) Related Links \nLos Angeles - Dylan Penn says it was \"kind of surreal\" to meet Madonna. \nThe 24-year-old model's father Sean Penn, who divorced the 57-year-old singer in 1989 after four years of marriage, introduced the pair for the first time after her gig at New York City's Madison Square Garden last month, but she insists they have no plans to rekindle their relationship. \nDylan said: \"I think he just really admires her work. They're just really good friends and I think it's sweet that they can have this relationship.\" \nBut the Condemned star, whose mother is House of Cards actress Robin Wright, admits it was a little strange to meet the Oscar winning-actor's first wife. \nShe told Entertainment Tonight : \"It was kind of surreal to meet her. Like, my dad's ex-lover.\" \nSean, who has been single since splitting from former fianc√©e Charlize Theron in June, previously revealed he and Madonna are still \"very friendly.\" \nSpeaking last year, the 54-year-old star added: \"Initially, in a divorce, you kick and bite about the other person. But finally you're looking at your failures to that person, to a marriage, to a friendship, to yourself during that time as well. Because no matter what the other person was or wasn't, for better and for worse, it really has so little to do with the growth you need to find better circumstances. \n\"Almost exclusively it has to do with your own stuff.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T06:26:53.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
