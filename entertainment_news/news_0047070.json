Asia's largest film festival opened its doors on Thursday for 10 days of screenings that will highlight the region's young talent and its rich heritage.(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon) \nBUSAN, South Korea (AP) — When Marina Gulbahari walked the red carpet on the first night of Asia’s largest film festival, she showed the world more than the colorful traditional Afghan dress she was wearing. \nShe showed the world the face of women in Afghanistan. \nFor Afghan women, showing one’s face in public, not to mention on a huge screen, is disliked by conservatives there, even as the fall of the hard-line Islamic Taliban regime allowed women to return to schools, workplaces and even to parliament. Many women still wear a burqa, the clothing that covers women from head to toe with a mesh panel over the face. \nSo walking the red carpet and co-hosting the opening event at the 20th annual Busan International Film Festival was a big step not only for the 23 year-old Gulbahari but for her fellow country people. \n“For the moment, living in Afghanistan is difficult for normal people. For women who are working as an actress, it’s more dangerous for them,” she said in an interview translated by her husband Noorullah Azizi, who works in movie and TV production in Afghanistan. “About some years ago (I) got some warnings from the Taliban that you cannot work. If you appear again, we will kill you.” \nAlthough little known outside the festival circle, Gulbahari is already part of movie history in her country. Her first role was as a young girl who had to be disguised as a boy to support her female-only household in “Osama.” It was Afghanistan’s first post-Taliban movie and it won the Golden Globe prize for best foreign film in 2003. \nLike the young girl she played, Gulbahari’s family needed her to support her parents and her seven siblings when she was young. When she was discovered by Siddiq Barmak, director of “Osama,” she was a teenager selling magazines at a park in Kabul, worrying about how to help feed her family. \n“What can I do to support my family?” she said. “It was (my) goal to find something to bring home.” \nAlthough Gulbahari never went to acting school, those moments in her life provided lessons that acting schools could not. \n“I have experiences. Tragic experiences,” she said with a beaming smile. \nAlthough she is now a big star in Afghanistan, she “never” thought she would become an actress. \nThe first movie she saw was “Titanic,” watching a videotape copy when she was nine years old even though the movie was banned under the Taliban. She did not understand that the movie was fiction. \n__ \nLee can be reached on Twitter: www.twitter.com/YKLeeAP Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T10:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:31:38.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
