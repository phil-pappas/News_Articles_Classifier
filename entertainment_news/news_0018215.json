The bulk of the work was completed last month, and four wineries already have hooked up.\nThe new lines were needed because septic systems, which are less than ideal from an environmental standpoint, no longer could accommodate the plans for the region. Those plans call for new hotels, lavish resorts and more tasting rooms.\n“It’s something that you have to have,” said Riverside County Supervisor Chuck Washington, the area’s representative on the board. “It’s just as necessary as the road and roundabouts.”\nIn future phases, Eastern could install lines that cover the eastern and southern sections of Wine Country, but district spokeswoman Roxanne Rountree said there’s no timetable for when that work may occur.\n“That will be development driven,” she said.\nTo help wineries in the region hook up to the system, the district has adopted a financing plan that allows property owners to spread out the fees over a five-year period.\nWashington said the plan was put together after several winery owners balked at the upfront cost of hooking up.\nIt costs $7,644 per equivalent dwelling unit, which translates into 210 gallons of wastewater per day. An average winery property is expected to need around 10 EDUs, according to district staff.\n“I think that will make it a lot more palatable for many of the wineries,” said Washington, talking about the financing plan. “If we’re going to be able to support growth and new expansion of wineries, we have to accommodate the infrastructure.”\nEven when they are working correctly, septic systems are less than ideal for a tourism destination because they can get backed up on high traffic days or busy weekends.\nThey also have a negative impact on the area’s watershed, which features a large aquifer that is used by the Rancho California Water District to augment its water supply.\n“We committed to linking before this plan came along,” said Claudio Ponte, owner of Ponte Winery. “We felt this was a good idea to try and protect the watershed.”\nRountree said the four wineries in the region that have hooked up are South Coast, Carter Estates, Miramonte and Avondale, which took advantage of the new financing plan.\nBill Wilson of Wilson Creek Winery & Vineyards said last week that he plans to hook up to the system as soon as he gets permission from the district, which is building a lift station pump near his property.\n“We have to just keep up with the demand that has hit our facility,” he said. “It’s just an inevitable problem.”\nPhayvanh Nanthavongdouangsy of the county’s Planning Department said a handful of expansion projects are working their way through the planning pipeline, including an addition at Ponte Winery that would add 30 rooms.\nSome of the other projects include two new wineries that will have hotels and one new winery that will have a restaurant.\nLast year, the county approved a planning blueprint for the entire 19,000-acre expanse that will allow for around 95 wineries – up from the 40 or so that call the region home right now – plus new bed-and-breakfasts, concert halls and other amenities.\nContact the writer: 951-368-9698 or aclaverie@pe.com Twitter: @PE_Claverie", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T04:21:27.466+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
