We also know that Benicio Del Toro is more or less confirmed to star in the film as well, but now it appears another casting has been made in the follow-up to The Force Awakens.\nGugu Mbatha-Raw, who starred in the early season of Doctor Who's reboot and Wachowski sci-fi dud Jupiter Ascending, has been reportedly cast in an unspecified role by Rian Johnson. The report, by Collider, suggests that the deal is close to being finalised, however there's been no official confirmation from Lucasfilm or Disney on the news.\nMbatha-Raw's career has been in a steady upward trajectory since she wowed critics in the period drama, Belle. Next year alone will see her star in the Oscar-bait drama The Free State of Jones alongside Matthew McConaughey, she has a meaty role in the NFL / Will Smith sports-drama Concussion and she's starring in the Emma Watson-led Beauty & The Beast live-action remake.\nAll in all, she's got a solid filmography behind her so there's no reason why she won't be amazing in the role and confirms that Lucasfilm's castings have been, so far, absolutely on-point.\nVia Collider\nMORE: Filming kicks off today on Skellig Michael for Star Wars: Episode VIII\nMORE: Star Wars: Episode VIII could be filmed in Ireland\nMORE: Martial arts superstar Donnie Yen may be joining Star Wars: Episode VIII", "external_links": ["http://collider.com/star-wars-8-gugu-mbatha-raw-cast/"], "published": "2015-10-08T19:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:09:08.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
