Felix Manalo, I think, reiterates this truth.” \nLamangan added that he hoped that the renewed interest in history generated by the film Heneral Luna would likewise encourage the public to watch Felix Manalo, as the movie traces the growth of the church in relation to the major historical events of the county. \n“Heneral Luna showed that there is a market for movies like these,” said the director whose past films include The Flor Contemplacion Story, Sidhi, Deathrow, Hubog, Aishte Imasu 1941, Blue Moon, and Mano Po. \n“Hopefully, the commercial success of historical dramas would open the door for similar projects, so that the public would be educated and enlightened, as well as entertained.” \nFelix Manalo premiered last Sunday, bagging the record for Largest Audience At A Film Premiere and the Largest Audience At A Film Screening with 43,624 people in the initial screening. \nTouted as the most expensive movie Viva Films has ever produced, the film stars Dennis Trillo as Felix Manalo and Bela Padilla as his wife Honorata de Guzman-Manalo. Its star-studded cast includes Gabby Concepcion, AJ Muhlach, Heart Evangelista, Snooky Serna, Gladys Reyes, Joel Torre, Elizabeth Oropesa, and Jaime Fabregas.
