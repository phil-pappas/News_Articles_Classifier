The 16-year-old girl was photographed playfully caressing Brooklyn's cheeks when the two arrived at the CBS Radio's \"We Can Survive\" concert at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles on Saturday, October 24. David Beckham 's son was all smiles as he looked into Sonia's eyes. Brooklyn was spotted wearing a white T-shirt topped with leather jacket. He completed his casual looks with black jeans and khaki ankle boots. The French actress, similarly, went casual in a white T-shirt and black jeans while toting a long-strapped orange bag. Though the two were getting cozy at the registation desk, they weren't pictured holding hands at the concert. However, they kept close together as they walked among the crowd. Brooklyn's ex-girlfriend Chloe Moretz also attended the concert with a group of pals. The \" Carrie \" actress reportedly almost had a run-in with the couple when she left the venue. Back in September, Brooklyn ignited rumors he found new love after breakup with Chloe as he posted on Instagram a picture of a girl's backside. In fact, the mystery girl was previously pictured together with him in August and it was Sonia. In an Instagram picture posted by Brooklyn in August, the two could be seen standing close to each other while he wrapped his arm around her waist. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T09:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T11:10:53.194+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
