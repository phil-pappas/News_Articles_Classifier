However, Australia will still go into the match as slight favourites given they have won 18 of the previous 24 meetings between the sides, including a 34-9 win in Mendoza when the sides last met three months ago.Nothing is set in stone though, and if this world cup has shown us anything, it's not what pundits predict is rarely the outcome.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T00:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:03:05.729+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
