The film is reportedly filled with high-adrenaline action and a dash of love. This reflects in its music as well. As with many other films in the past, Bikers Adda's album starts with a rocking Ganesh vandana. The song 'Ala Re Ala' sung by Jasraj Joshi is an average number. Next up, 'Wallah Wallah' sung by Shalmali Kholgade and Shreyas Dharmadhikari, is a Hindi song. The Arabic tune might make this popular among belly-dance enthusiasts. Rimzim Rimzim is a love song sung by Priyanka Barve. This is also the only serene song as opposed to the other high-energy numbers.\n'Tune To Love' is an out and out EDM party number crooned by Shonna Gonsalves and Siddhant Bhonsle, that tries to induce a trance-like feeling but falters badly with its pathetic lyrics. Jasraj returns with the Marathi rap song 'Lecture Gyan'. Apart from Dharmesh Yelande dancing to the song, this is just another bad attempt at rapping in Marathi. Bikers Adda's music is good in bits and parts but on the whole, it can be given a miss.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:47:10.862+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
