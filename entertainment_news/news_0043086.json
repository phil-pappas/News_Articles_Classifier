Photo: Simon Holt \nAn error in judgement left superstar showman Robbie Williams temporarily red-faced during his Brisbane show Saturday night after he discovered the recipient of his sexy secretary gag was celebrating her 15th birthday.\nIt was the well-rehearsed part of the show, just before the third song of the encore, where he finds an attractive bespectacled woman, tells her how much he likes the secretary look, and shares with the crowd how the scenario reminds him he needs to clean up his computer.\nHe then sings hit song She's The One to his lucky new \"girlfriend\".\n\"What's your name?\" he asked.\nAdvertisement \"Morgan. It's my birthday,\" his excited fan responded.\nWilliams continued: \"I love the secretary look. Which reminds me, I really do need to clean up my computer.\n\"How old are you?\"\nMorgan: \"15.\"\nWilliams: \"Oh shit. Are you here with your mum?\"\nMorgan: \"Yes.\"\nMorgan's mother, now on the big Boondall screens, seemed as starstruck as her daughter.\n\"Please don't put this on Youtube,\" Williams said. \"It'll be on Youtube, then it'll be in the newspapers, then we'll all be in trouble.\n\"What am I going to say? Stay away from boys like me, Morgan. They're f***ing arseholes.\"\nThe consummate professional, Williams sang the song to Morgan anyway, and \"mostly your mum\" as he turned the romance component of the routine to the legal half of the mosh pit duo.\nBut he didn't go without some good-natured ribbing from the backup singer to his right.\n\"Let it go,\" he muttered to her in jest as she continued to laugh mid-song, his face turning a bright shade of slightly embarrassed pink.\nMorgan wasn't the only one to claim her 15 minutes of fame during the two hours of Williams mega-hits.\nA girl named Carla danced on stage with Robbie in his virtual stand-up bed, lip-synching every word to the upbeat song Hot Fudge .\nWilliams said she'd done the best job of audience participation than anyone else on the tour to date, and took the chance to tell the crowd at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre how much better they'd been than Perth and Adelaide.\nThe full house was littered with signs of British pride - English, British and Irish flags, along with other less parochial signs such as the unusual request: \"Robbie, sign my bum so I can show my mum.\"\nAnd it was a written message which started the show, displayed on the massive projection at the back of the stage: \"Brisbane, am I still your son?\"\nThen Williams emerged from a rousing opener of Let Me Entertain You which had the crowd bouncing the same way other big names might see for closing numbers: \"Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Robbie f***ing Williams. And this is my band.\"\nHe promised to own the stage for two hours. He proceeded to own the audience, with his charisma, with engaging eye-balling - even to those \"in the shit seats\" at the side of the stage - in a way which connected simultaneously with the thousands of individuals in it, with comedy, tales of his children, and with songs which have made him one of the biggest names in music for two decades.\nThe crowd in 2015 is seeing a new side to the tattooed bad boy - typified by a genuine quiver of his lip when he introduced his \"daddy\" Pete during a duet of Better Man .\nMany in the packed audience were seen wiping their own eyes, as much for the beauty of the song as for the father-son moment.\n\"It's my favourite part of the show,\" Williams said.\nWilliams is a natural storyteller, in both song and regular voice. His appreciation for an eclectic genre of music - covering Lorde, Queen and others during the concert - is as broad as his personality is captivating.\nThere's been boy band Robbie, popstar Robbie and jazz big band Robbie. The latest show and latest iteration of Robbie is a family man who has fans in the palm of his hand from the minute he walks on stage, until minutes after he departs.\nOn Saturday night, no Williams fan left disappointed. Rather, they saw their idol was more passionate and entertaining than ever.\n\nPlaylist \nLet Me Entertain You\nRock DJ\nMonsoon/Hey Jude\nCome Undone\nMe & My Monkey\nRoad to Mandalay/Back For Good\nMotherf***er\nBetter Man\nSupreme Original\nWe Will Rock You\nI Love Rock 'n' Roll\nHot Fudge\nFeel\nRoyals\nMillennium\nWhole Lot of Love\nKids\nEncore\nBohemian Rhapsody\nShe's The One\nAngels\nMy Way", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T05:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T11:27:15.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
