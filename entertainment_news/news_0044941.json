Sotheby's says it was revealed during a 2000 conservation. An inscription indicates it was intended as a gift to Manach. \nThe seller is billionaire businessman William Koch (kohk), who displayed it so it could be seen from both sides. \nHe's also selling a 1908 \"Water Lilly\" painting by Claude Monet. It's estimated at $30 million to $50 million. \nThe sale is Nov. 5. \nKoch is a 1992 America's Cup winner and brother of conservative donors Charles and David Koch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:57:15.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
