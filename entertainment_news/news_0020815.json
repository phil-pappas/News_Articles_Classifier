Friday morning, the 24-year-old set off on a 300-mile journey to New York City, a journey he admits may be a reach. But it's one he fully plans to accomplish.\nJohnson didn't start running to improve his health. He wanted to change the mentality in the neighborhood through his newly-launched movement, Rochester Run for Change .\nSince Aug. 20, he ran four or eight miles daily through southwest Rochester, often starting and ending at the Boys & Girls Club of Rochester, the site of a mass shooting. ​ Johnny Johnson, 25, Jonah Barley, 17, and Raekwon Manigault,19, were all killed in the dark, humid evening hours of Aug. 19 there. Seven people total were shot after a basketball game.\nThough he did not know any of the slain men, Johnson was moved by their deaths . He quit his job and started running, in part to prepare to run from Rochester to New York City.\nAfter stretching for several minutes by the Boys & Girls Club, Johnson started running south. Trailed by his mother in a rental car, Johnson said he will run on trails and back roads through New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey to reach his goal — his cousin's home in Staten Island.\nBuy Photo Micah Kalani Johnson, the founder of Rochester Run for Change, begins his run to New York City on Genesee St. on Friday, October 2, 2015.

I'm doing this. Even if I get tired, I'll just walk it.\"\nJohnson said he hoped his journey would inspire other city youth to follow their dreams.\n\"If you focus on doing what you love and what makes you happy, you won't have time for anything else,\" he said.\nJohnson said he plans to run at least 50 miles daily, stopping to sleep in the car at gas stations and truck stops when he needs a break. He's not concerned that he's never run more than eight miles at a time while training. He plans to do what he can for as long as he can.\nBuy Photo Micah Kalani Johnson plans out his running route with his mom, Winnie Johnson, on Friday, October 2, 2015.

(Photo: LAUREN PETRACCA/@laurenpetracca/, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER)\n\"I'm in full support of him,\" said mom Winnie Johnson, who will mark her 57th birthday from the road on Sunday. If all goes to plan, the pair will be south of Ithaca by then.\n\"As long as we can go, we'll go,\" Winnie Johnson said. \"If he reaches a point when he can't do it anymore, then that will be his mark. But he's going for it.\"\nMicah Kalani Johnson plans to remind himself why he must look toward changing others' attitudes with each step. He continues to try to raise funds to establish scholarships in memory of the three men killed. His lofty goal rose to $1 billion, and as of Friday collected $730.\nEvery bit helps.\n\"We need to think for change and be the positive change,\" he said.\nVFREILE@Gannett.com", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/02/Rochester/Rochester/635793720769371239-LP-micahs-run-to-nyc-B-100215-Metro.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/02/Rochester/Rochester/635793720769371239-LP-micahs-run-to-nyc-B-100215-Metro.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/95668c8d55819a1094ed729a2727934a9894f03a/c=54-0-2714-2000&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/02/Rochester/Rochester/635793720769371239-LP-micahs-run-to-nyc-B-100215-Metro.JPG", "http://www.gofundme.com/pm2phdkg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/02/Rochester/Rochester/635793720700418797-LP-micahs-run-to-nyc-A-100215-Metro.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/02/Rochester/Rochester/635793720700418797-LP-micahs-run-to-nyc-A-100215-Metro.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a94f196690b194cf6bd8607957e2cf5284f8e934/c=216-0-2876-2000&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/02/Rochester/Rochester/635793720700418797-LP-micahs-run-to-nyc-A-100215-Metro.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-02T17:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:05:59.822+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
