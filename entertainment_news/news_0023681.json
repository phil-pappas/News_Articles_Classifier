Photo courtesy of Suspect Press Most revolutions fail. If not politically, then at least philosophically. That’s the underlying theme of Daniel Landes and Karl Christian Krumpholz’ new collaborative comic, “ Revolt To What? ”\nBeing released Friday, Oct. 9 at the Deerpile event space in Denver, the book is about a former velvet revolutionary drinking away his days away in Prague just after the fall of communism in Eastern Europe. At a bar, he meets a quiet traveler and, over cocktails, they discuss how capitalism has changed the city.\nAlthough the book was written by Landes as a short story, then turned into a comic by Krumpholz, they both agree it’s not a political read. Landes, who has been penning creative fiction for nearly 20 years, wanted to draw a comparison between his travels through Prague in the early 1990s and today’s ever-expanding Denver.\n“It’s a story about the naivete of revolt without really knowing what’s on other side; the machine of capitalism that was ready to seize a beautiful city.” Landes says. “This was pretty much an experience that I had when I was traveling in Prague in my early 20s.”\nLandes has lived in Denver since it was still a cowtown. He used to own the city’s main vegan eatery, Watercourse , but sold it in June to focus on his more recent vegetarian venture, City ’O‘ City . In a few short years, Landes has seen his beloved Denver turn into a gentrified, overpopulated hodgepodge of outsiders, much like early ’90s Prague.\nKrumpholz , who has been living and cartooning in Denver for 10 years, is also amazed and appalled by the changes. He mentions that, “the money and jobs flowed like a titlewave through Denver, which led to rapid gentrification and, yeah, all the cool stuff is gone.”\nIn 1989, the velvet revolution swept through Czechoslovakia. Thousands of students and older dissidents peacefully demonstrated to end communism and, in nearly two months, they got their wish. Less monumental that the reformed Czech Republic’s overnight switch from communism to all-out capitalism was Denver’s legalization of marijuana. In a way, it was Denver’s own little revolution.\n“I think the marijuana thing was a paradigm shift .” Landes remarks. “We were raised in prohibition and, all of a sudden, prohibition is released. This is what we fought for. This is what we wanted. Now, weed culture is bogus.”\nThe pot boom along with a still-growing job market has put Denver at No. 16 on Forbes list for cities with job growth in 2015. At the same time, the city has seen an increase in cost of living that’s 6.7 percent higher than the national average. Rent prices have skyrocketed due to an influx of job-seekers. This has caused many landmarks in Denver (especially old houses ) to shutter, sell to the highest bidder and get paved over.\n“People can’t afford it anymore; the rent to keep dive bars open or the area [developers] want to clean up,” Krumpholz notes. “My girlfriend has been here her whole life and she can barely recognize it.”\nSharing such perspectives, Landes and Krumpholz knew that “Revolt to What?” would be a timely and relevant story for native Denverites (or anyone experiencing unprecedented growth in their once humble city). This summer, they decided to flush it out into a 24-page, black-and-white comic.\nLandes is no stranger to the format. Since 2013, he has worked with Denver artists Ravi Zupa and Noah Van Sciver to make two other books .\n“I’m a huge comic book fan and I prefer that medium to anything else.” he says. “For me, it’s just a beautiful next level of storytelling. Anytime I can collab with a comic book artist, it’s just amazing.”\nKrumpholz agrees. As a reader and creator of comics, he understands their magical power, explaining that, “Comics have always been considered a lowbrow kind of art because they speak to people in a way that straight prose can’t. They’re easy to understand.”\n“Revolt to What?” will be the first comic release from Landes’ fledgling literary project, Suspect Press . Until now, the label has only released quarterly zines, but with Denver journalist and author Josiah Hesse as curator, Suspect Press will start publishing books and novels.\nThe new endeavour is a topic that Landes and Krumpholz will likely discuss during an interview with Hesse, at Friday’s release party. After the Q&A session, they will show their comic on a projector. Both hope that the big screen debut of “Revolt to What?” will captivate audiences.\n“When I sat down with Karl and he showed me each page, it was like watching my story on film,” Landes says. “The facial expressions, the settings and everything coming to life; it’s just a deeper engagement into a story.”\nThe release will also feature performances from renowned poet Mathias Svalina, singer-songwriter Joe Sampson, and dark post-rockers Bad Luck City.\nRevolutionized Denver may be different, but as long as people like Landes and Krumpholz are around, rubbing great art into its cultural makeup, the city will never lose its identity completely. It will always be home to fiercely independent, creative natives, as well as a haven for floods of transplants looking for a good life. Maybe sometime, over cocktails or comics, they can reach some common ground on where Denver is headed.", "external_links": ["http://www.westword.com/restaurants/dan-landes-on-watercourse-foods-sale-and-denvers-cultural-community-6766260", "http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_25076366/parts-denver-and-aurora-still-make-list-flipping", "http://www.westword.com/news/demolition-begins-at-two-denver-landmarks-5122685", "http://karlchristiankrumpholz.com/", "http://www.thecannabist.co/2014/04/07/restaurateur-dan-landes-hopes-for-the-stoned-citizens-of-denver-watercourse-city-o-city/8894/", "http://www.cityocitydenver.com/", "http://www.npr.org/2014/02/16/277691480/the-green-rush-begins-investors-get-in-on-pots-ground-floor", "http://www.cpr.org/news/story/denvers-best-dive-bars-are-fading-away-author-says", "https://www.facebook.com/SuspectPress", "https://www.facebook.com/events/1635674106700959/", "http://money.cnn.com/2015/06/04/real_estate/marijuana-denver-housing-market/", "http://www.amazon.com/Daniel-Landes/e/B00A6DF5RY/ref=dp_byline_cont_ebooks_1", "http://www.ibtimes.com/what-velvet-revolution-peaceful-movement-overthrew-communist-czechoslovakia-lives-25-1724963"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:45:45.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
