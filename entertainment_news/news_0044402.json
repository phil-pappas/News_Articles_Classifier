Tickets for Sunday's game against the New York Giants on the secondary market are the highest in five years, according to Chris Leyden, an analyst with SeatGeek . He said the average resale price for a ticket is $165, which surpasses the season's previous high of $149 for the Buffalo versus New England matchup.\n\"Fans who waited until the last minute to buy tickets can probably save some money, as we have seen prices drop over the past week,\" he said, noting that since Sunday median listed prices have dropped 36 percent, or from $260 to $167. \"Looking over the past few months it actually looks like prices were building up throughout the start of the season, and now with the game just a few days away sellers need to offload tickets, and because of that are dropping prices.\"\nOf those looking for tickets, 75 percent live in the state. About 26 percent are from Buffalo; 23 percent from New York City and the lower Hudson Valley area and 17 percent are from the Rochester area.\nBuffalo (2-1) plays New York (1-2) at 1 p.m.\nTCLAUSEN@Gannett.com", "external_links": ["https://seatgeek.com/giants-at-bills-tickets/10-4-2015-orchard-park-new-york-ralph-wilson-stadium/nfl/2594528/"], "published": "2015-10-02T21:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:50:18.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
