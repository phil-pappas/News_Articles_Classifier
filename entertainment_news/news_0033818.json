Donovan. Three-time Tony winner Mark Rylance (“Boeing-Boeing,” “Jerusalem,” “Twelfth Night”) turns his role as Soviet agent Rudolf Abel into a master class of subtle brush strokes.\nThey’re in great company. Scott Shepherd, known for “Gatz,” a seven-hour verbatim stage take on “The Great Gatsby,” lends rock-solid support as a CIA operative. Will Rogers, who’s racked up 10 Off-Broadway performances since 2006, has meaty moments as the captured American student Frederic Pryor.\nTony nominees Billy Magnussen (“Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike”) and Stephen Kunken (“Enron”), respectively play Donovan’s eager assistant assistant Attorney General William F. Tompkins.\n“Hand to God” Tony nominee Steven Boyer appears as a paralegal in Donovan’s office in one scene that was filmed at the New York Bar Association in midtown.\nHanks “was like the Tom Hanks of ‘Big’ and ‘Splash,’” says Boyer. “He was easygoing and full of energy. He kept it light.”\nBoyer’s role — one scene and three days’ work — was filmed entirely with Hanks. “That was great,” says Boyer. “I thought, ‘Hey, this means I’ll make it into the final cut.”\njdziemianowicz@nydailynews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:15:25.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
