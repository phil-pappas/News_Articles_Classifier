Story highlights Several of the acts have been nominated before Chic has been on the list 10 times The inductees will be announced in December (CNN) This year's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nominees include some familiar faces and one star who has just returned to the scene. Janet Jackson, N.W.A, Nine Inch Nails, Chicago, the Smiths, and Cheap Trick are just a few of the acts vying to enter the Class of 2016. They are joined by Chic, Deep Purple, Chaka Khan, Yes, The J.B.'s, Los Lobos, Steve Miller, The Spinners and The Cars. A few of the performers have been nominated before, including the group Chic, which has now been tapped 10 times without yet having been inducted. But it's the first time for Janet Jackson, who recently released her first album in seven years and launched a tour. Other first-timers to the list include Chicago, Steve Miller, Chaka Khan, Cheap Trick, The Cars, The J.B.'s, and Los Lobos. To be eligible for the current ballot, artists or bands must have released their first single or album in 1990 or earlier. Once again this year, fans will have the opportunity to vote on who they wish to see inducted by visiting the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame website or RollingStone.com and casting their ballot. The Class of 2016 will be announced in December and inducted in April 2016 at a ceremony in New York City. HBO, which is owned by CNN's parent company Time Warner, will broadcast the ceremony at a later date.
