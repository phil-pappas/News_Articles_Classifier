Moylan , LCPC\nNAPERVILLE, Ill. , Oct. 2, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Counselor Robert A. Moylan, LCPC has discovered, through 20 years of psychology research, the simplest and most effective behavioral psychology approach currently available in the world to treat most relationship/psychological stress, including eating disorders, addictions, depression, anxiety, anger, trauma, marital discord, sports psychology and personality disorders. His book for adults, \"Emotional Core Therapy,\" was the top-rated book on amazon.com in 2014 in two categories: \"Mental Health\" and \"Emotions.\" His book for teens called \"Emotional Core Therapy for Adolescents\" was ranked number seven in the same category. His third book, \"Mastering the Psychology of Golf with Emotional Core Therapy\" was just published this year and is a breakthrough in the world of golf psychology. His new book, \"Spiritual Inner Peace and Happiness with Emotional Core Therapy\" incorporates the powerful tools of prayer and mindfulness that religions have used for hundreds of years. Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Jews, Taoists, Buddhists, as well as secular people can now learn how to have a true and long lasting relationship with their spiritual center by learning to unlock psychic pain with Moylan's eight step ECT Flowchart.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151001/273197\nHere is a link to Moylan's spiritual book on Amazon as well as his book for teens, adults, and golfers.\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Robert-A.-Moylan/e/B00976KPCG/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1\nWith Emotional Core Therapy (ECT) Mr. Moylan, has discovered the root cause of psychological stress. Also, he has produced the only psychological approach in the world that accurately and successfully treats the root cause of relationship stress. Up until now, the vast majority of therapists, counselors, social workers, psychiatrists, ministers, monks, priests, coaches have been relying on psychology techniques/approaches such as Rational Emotive Therapy/REBT, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy/CBT, Dialectical Behavioral Therapy/DBT, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy/ACT, Positive Psychology, Psychoanalysis, Motivational Interviewing, Positive Psychology, 12 Steps, even religious teachings to heal people.\nECT uses some of the same teachings/techniques as all of the above approaches (along with Moylan's own research and findings) but has condensed the process to eight steps. His discovery is so simple you only need a tenth or eleventh grade reading level for the adult book. Junior high school students can read his teen books. Non readers can also learn ECT if they can be taught the process. With ECT, there is renewed hope that addictions and mental health issues can be treated more effectively throughout the world.\nThis is a landmark day in the field of psychology, according to Mr. Moylan because we now have an effective psychology tool to treat all current psychological disorders where the patient has not suffered permanent physical or psychological damage. According to Moylan, ECT can help anyone, even those without a psychological diagnosis. Why? ECT teaches you how to have inner peace and happiness. A goal of nearly all humans. The root cause of stress is entering and leaving relationships that require needs to be met. We sense this stress through our five senses and cause one of four feelings to arise. Those four feelings are joy, grief, fear, and relief.\nAll relationship stress in existence (for example, binge eating, addiction to cocaine, financial loss in stock market, spousal abuse, parenting a disruptive teen, missing a free throw in basketball, death of a loved one, throwing out your back lifting a baby, celebrating a birthday, etc) can be traced back to one of the four feelings. These four feelings alter the central nervous system, thus causing stress to humans. The key is to learn to identify, process, and release these four feelings as they are with most of us hourly and daily our entire lives. These four feelings are temporary but (grief and fear) can be debilitating from time to time. The four true emotions serve as a navigation tool or compass for all humans if you allow yourself to learn from them.\nIntegral to the ECT approach is to learn to have a relaxed, daydreaming, meditative lifestyle, similar to what psychologists call mindfulness. Prayer and mindfulness can be useful tools to reach this relaxing state of being. Then when these four feelings come, learn to cathartically release them. Once you can learn and apply the eight step ECT Flowchart to your own lives, you can gain the confidence that you can weather almost any future relationship stress. The field of psychology has never had a psychological process that can claim these results. ECT can help improve the quality of life for millions of people. Why? If someone uses and applies ECT to their daily lives, they have the full confidence they can effectively treat future stresses in their lives.\nMental health professionals and religious healers of all kinds will learn to love the inclusive aspects of this teaching tool. Any psychology technique that can successfully release emotions can be incorporated into the ECT approach. This includes popular techniques such as Prayer, Mindfulness, Gestalt Therapy, Hypnosis, Art Therapy, Psychodrama, EMDR/Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, etc. Even common relaxation techniques such as yoga, Pilates, jogging, gardening, etc, can be incorporated into the ECT approach.\nHere is the ECT video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ty9OE2lqNX8\nHere is Mr. Moylan's blog which has many of Mr. Moylan's media interviews along with Continuing Education class information.\nBob's Blog. http://www.robertmoylanlcpc.blogspot.com\nHere is the Emotional Core Therapy approach in the International Journal of Emergency\nHealth and Human Resilience which further describes the ECT process along with having other references and media links.\nhttp://omicsonline.com/open-access/emotional-core-therapy-book-review-1522-4821-16-132.php?aid=32238\nMr. Moylan is licensed by many state boards to train mental health and medical professionals ECT for license renewal and provide CEUs.
