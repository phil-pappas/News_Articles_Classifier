Barrowman , Special to the Journal Sentinel Oct. 23, 2015 4:33 p.m. “A Banquet of Consequences” by Elizabeth George “Mrs. Roosevelt's Confidante” by Susan Elia Macneal “Smaller and Smaller Circles” by F. H. Batacan \nWhen corrupt politicians hold a society in a repressive vise, imagination and ideas suffer as much as any human rights, especially when those ideas challenge the master narrative. Perhaps this explains why F. H. Batacan's outstanding debut, \"Smaller and Smaller Circles,\" (Soho Crime) is the first of its kind — a Filipino crime novel. Set in Quezon City in Manila in the late 1990s, Batacan has written a priest procedural (or Catholic noir), a novel where the righteousness of two Jesuits, Father Saenz, a forensic anthropologist, and his associate, Father Lucero, a psychologist, drives its gripping plot. Against this backdrop, Batacan, a native of Manila, explores the legacies of the \"dark days of the dictatorship\" and a world where \"high society matrons\" have \"pet priests and pet cardinals,\" where basking in \"reflected glory\" matters more than the lives of the poor, and where Saenz and Lucero take on a politically charged investigation with conscience and compassion. I hope this is the beginning of a series. \n\"Even though war continued to rage, there was reason to hope\" because Maggie Hope, that is, once again is working undercover for the Allied war effort in Susan Elia MacNeal's finely detailed historical novel set in the early 20th century. In \"Mrs. Roosevelt's Confidante\" (Bantam), Maggie travels with the prime minister to Washington, where our intrepid heroine seasoned in \"spying and sabotage behind enemy lines\" is plunged into tensions between the U.S. and Britain in 1941, involving a murder plot to discredit the first lady, Eleanor Roosevelt, and President's Roosevelt struggle to find a balance between \"the right thing to do\" and \"what must be done.\" Fans of the series will appreciate meeting Maggie's feisty aunt and learning more about Maggie's American past, and, like always, MacNeal's fictional world is populated with an intriguing cast of real characters. In this one Walt Disney, who created propaganda for the war effort, has one of the best lines in the novel: \"the side with the best stories is going to win.\" Indeed. \nFinally, I'm happy to report that Elizabeth George's \"Banquet of Consequences\" (Viking), her nineteenth featuring Inspector Lynley and Sergeant Havers, is as absorbing as her first book in this acclaimed series. The deep friendship between the two detectives, the psychological motivations of engaging characters, especially a mother who makes Joan Crawford look like Mother Teresa, and a complex plot that opens 39 months before Lynley and Havers' investigation showcase all the elements that make George one of the reigning queens of the genre. Havers is trying to be on her best behavior because of recent questionable actions during her last investigation, but a \"lip biting, teeth grinding, fingernails digging and tongue holding\" Havers is driving Lynley crazy. While investigating the murder of a popular feminist author, Lynley works to get his partner back into good graces with their boss. A few books ago when George killed off one of her beloved series characters, I didn't think she'd find her stride again, but in this novel she's marching again with attitude — a dark and deadly one. \nCarole E. Barrowman is a professor of English at Alverno College and co-author of three \"Hollow Earth\" novels, including the recently published \"The Book of Beasts.\" © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc.
