Scott J. Cooper, CEO and Creative Director of World Patent Marketing , made the donation in honor of his close friend and confidante, Brig. General (Res.) Nitzan Nuriel of the IDF. \nGeneral Nuriel was honored by the Congress of the United States last month during the week of September 11 for his commitment to world security and the fight against terrorism. General Nuriel was Military Attache to the Israeli Embassy in Washington DC, where he served as the official liaison between the US Army, Marine Corps, Special Operations Command, FEMA and Homeland Security. He received the Legion of Merit from the President of the United States for his exceptional accomplishments. \n\"The Cooper Idea Foundation and my friend Scott Cooper are great supporters of the State of Israel.\" said General Nuriel, \"As a soldier and General in the IDF, I can tell you that events like this make a difference in the lives of our soldiers on the front lines. Now more then ever, your contributions matter.\" \n\"We are proud to be able support the Friends of the IDF Young Leadership Program,\" said Scott J. Cooper, CEO and Creative Director of World Patent Marketing , \"I spent a lot of time with General Nuriel this summer in Israel. He has devoted his career to protecting the State of Israel and fighting the global war on terror. We are proud to make this contribution in his honor.\" \n\"It is always important for the South Florida community to come out and show their support for Israel and her soldiers, but it is especially imperative now during this particularly challenging time period in Israel, as Israelis are experiencing a rising tide of terror attacks, and it is the brave IDF soldiers whose lives are on the line each and every day protecting our only Jewish state.\" said Co-President Jaime Mittleman. \"Right now, as Israelis are experiencing a rising tide of terror attacks, it is even more important then ever for our community to come out and show their support for Israel and the brave IDF soldiers, whose lives are on the line each and every day, protecting our only Jewish state.\" \nAbout Friends of the IDF \nFriends of the Israel Defense Forces (FIDF) was established in 1981 by a group of Holocaust survivors, under the leadership of John Klein z'l, to provide for education and well being of the men and women who serve in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) as well as the families of fallen soldiers. Headquartered in New York City, FIDF is a 501c3 not-for-profit corporation that operates 15 regional offices in the United States and Panama. \nThe strength of the IDF, which has been guarding the State of Israel since it declared independence in 1948, derives from the selfless determination and great capabilities of the young men and women who form it. At the tender age of 18, all Israelis are drafted into the IDF. Those who serve commit to uphold the difficult tasks of defending Israel's borders and guaranteeing the safety of its people. \nThe Israeli government is responsible for training IDF soldiers and providing them with the necessary tools for their service. FIDF is committed to providing these soldiers with love, support, and care in an effort to ease the burden they carry on behalf of the Jewish community worldwide. \nTheir job is to look after Israel. Ours is to look after them. \nAbout The Cooper Idea Foundation \nThe Cooper Idea Foundation is dedicated to providing funding for special causes around the world.
