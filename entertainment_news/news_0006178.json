His debut single, “Cowboys and Angels,” also went to No. 1. Lynch is still on a roll with his sophomore album, last year’s “Where It’s At,” which boasts more than 1 million in sales of downloaded tracks. Last month, the rocking “Hell of a Night” became the second consecutive No. 1 from “Where It’s At,” following the title song. He will headline his first tour in November.\nJohn Goodspeed\nUsher, Britney Spears and Jay-Z round out the Top 5, according to an Associated Press report.\nBut wait — there’s more.\nSuperstars also can cause traffic jams like the one earlier this month before Bryan’s concert at a winery in Lexington, Kentucky.\nVehicles were backed up nearly eight miles, and many of them ran out of gas, according to the Lexington Herald-Leader. Some folks just pulled over and walked. Of course, it was just a two-lane road, and Bryan delayed the show to wait for fans.\nA lot more roads, though, lead to the Alamodome , where Bryan will bring his Kick Up the Dust Tour at 7:30 p.m. Thursday with Randy Houser and Dustin Lynch.\nJust in case, VIA Metropolitan Transit will offer special event park-and-ride service from the AT&T Center beginning at 5 p.m. Thursday with return buses running for one hour after the end of the show. Round-trip fare is $5 with the usual discounts available.\nVIA also will divert Route 100 Primo into the Robert Thompson Transit Station at the Alamodome from 5 p.m. until one hour after the concert. The fare is $1.20. Call 210-362-2020.\nThe Kick Up the Dust Tour is named for Bryan’s lead single from his fifth studio album, “Kill the Lights,” released in August. “Kick Up the Dust,” his 13th No. 1, topped charts the same week the album debuted at No. 1 on Billboard’s country and Top 200 charts — his third consecutive No. 1 on the all-genre chart.\nThe second single, “Strip It Down,” currently tops Billboard’s country chart.\n“Kill the Lights” is the highest country album debut in two years, since Bryan’s “Crash My Party” in August 2013.\n“Crash My Party” also produced six consecutive No. 1 singles, including “I See You,” “Drink a Beer” and “Play It Again,” and sold more than 2 million copies and 8 million downloads.\nThe tour, which began May 8 in Grand Forks, North Dakota, will end Oct. 30 at Ford Field in Detroit. That show sold out the day that tickets went on sale, marking the 10th sold-out stadium concert on the tour so far.\nIn 2013, Bryan’s first major headlining tour played before 1.3 million fans. Last year, the total jumped to 1.7 million.\nBryan even is the focus of an exhibit at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville. “Luke Bryan: Dirt Road Diary,” which runs through Nov. 8, includes memorabilia such as his Little League baseball uniform, his first guitar, which his parents gave him when he was 14, and bows and arrows he used on the Outdoor Channel series “Buck Commander: Protected by Under Armour.”\nBryan grew up on the family farm in Leesburg, Georgia, where his father grew peanuts and sold fertilizer, listening to George Strait , Alan Jackson and Conway Twitty.\nAfter college at Georgia Southern University , he left the farm for Nashville, where he landed a song publishing contract and later a recording deal with Capitol Records.\nHis debut album in 2007, “I’ll Stay Me,” spawned the Top 5 single “All My Friends Say.” His neo-traditional country style spiced with party-hearty, rocking pop-country caught fire.\nTwo years later, his sophomore album “Doin’ My Thing” hit No. 2 on the charts and produced two No. 1 singles - “Rain Is a Good Thing” and “Someone Else Calling You Baby.”\nHis third album, “Tailgates & Tanlines,” led to two more No. 1s and two Top 5s. “Spring Break … Here to Party” in 2013 fanned the flames with more hits.\n“Crash My Party” led to superstardom — and Internet infamy as a dangerous celebrity. Still, he stays grounded and tries to show it in his latest album, he told The Tennessean.\n“I wanted to show moments of maturing. That has to be there. That's what's going on in my life,” he told the Nashville newspaper. “But I also can’t run from the fact that when I look out into a crowd, what my fans are.\n“I am absolutely amazed when 16-year-old girls jump out of a car and run up to me wanting a picture.”\njohn@johngoodspeed.com", "external_links": ["http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/74/8793884/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/74/8793884/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/74/8793886/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/74/8793882/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/74/8793883/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/74/8793888/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/74/8793883/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/74/8793887/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/74/8793882/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/74/8793881/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/74/8793888/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/74/8793887/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/74/8793881/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/74/8793886/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T15:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:18:29.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
