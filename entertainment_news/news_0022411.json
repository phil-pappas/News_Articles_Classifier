What she will admit is her nervous excitement at being Shah Rukh Khan's heroine in Gauri Shinde's upcoming untitled project\nThe marketing campaign of 'Shaandaar' has reached a crescendo with lead pair Alia Bhatt and Shahid Kapoor trying to bait in as many guests as possible for the destination wedding drama. The upcoming film is special for the actress for more reasons than one: working with three actors from the same family — Pankaj Kapur, Shahid and his half-sister Sanah, apart from the fact that she sees 90 per cent of herself in the quirky character she essays.\n\nAlia Bhatt \n“When I put on costumes, it didn’t feel like I was someone else. For example, I wore boots with traditionawear, just like I would do in real life. The entire shoot was a memorable experience. My co-stars made me feel at home. I worked closely with Pankaj sir since he plays my father in the film. He is a great actor and made me feel comfortable with his warm nature. He allowed me to do the scenes in my own style. Shahid and Sanah are also hardworking professionals,” she says.\nAlia will share screen space with Shahid in 'Udta Punjab', which also features Kareena Kapoor Khan. Though the shooting has wrapped up, she doesn’t want to discuss the film at this point. “There is nothing I can say that will sum up my experience. It was extremely challenging. I got a chance to be part of a world different from my own. I have never been that exhausted, and happily so, after playing a character,” she reveals.\nShe is also teaming up with Shah Rukh Khan for Gauri Shinde’s untitled next. Is she feeling butterflies in her stomach? “Of course, I am nervous and excited. I want to go and see what I can learn from him. I want to make the most out of the moment. I have interacted with him at a couple of social events and he’s always been warm,” she says.\n\nAlia Bhatt in a still from 'Shaandaar' \nHaving tasted both critical and commercial success, the 22-year-old has become choosy about scripts now. “For me, the audience’s response matters the most. Highway was appreciated, but was not a money-spinner like '2 States'. While choosing any script, I ask myself if I will be able to reach out to a wider audience. I want people to remember me by my character’s name or a song featuring me. Like, people still know me as Radha from that song in my debut film, 'Student of The Year',” smiles Alia.\n\nIs Radha seeing Krishna, er, Sidharth Malhotra, her co-star from the 2012 film? Alia purses her lips and says, “I have maintained that I will never comment on any relationship which is personal.”\nAlso view... \n\nSpotted: Alia Bhatt outside Sidharth Malhotra's residence \nAlia Bhatt recently paid a visit to her rumoured beau Sidharth Malhotra in the wee hours of the night (View pictures) \n\nWho is calling Alia Bhatt? \nDuring a recent promotional event, Sasha spilled the beans about how Alia is always on the phone with a certain 'Sid from Marketing' (Read more) \n\nDeepika Padukone, Alia Bhatt to star opposite Shah Rukh Khan? \nApparently, Deepika Padukone and Alia Bhatt have been roped in for Aanand L Rai's upcoming film starring Shah Rukh Khan (Read more)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:00:45.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
