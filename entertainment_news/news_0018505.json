Its catalogue included albums by Chick Corea, Lee Ritenour, Diana Krall, Diane Schuur, Patti Austin, Dr. John and Ramsey Lewis. \nGRP was the first record label to use digital recording technology for all its releases and issue every release on the new CD format. \nRosen and Grusin sold GRP to MCA Records in a multimillion-dollar deal. Rosen remained as president and CEO of the label until 1995.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:27:22.107+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
