Oktoberfest brews are released and pumpkin and other seasonal autumn beers make their appearances for the year. \nPumpkin brews in particular have carved an increasingly larger slice of the fall beer market. They’re a bit like pumpkin pie in a pint glass with such traditional spices as cinnamon and nutmeg. The market has embraced them, same as the big malty marzen/Oktoberfest brews. \nMany good beers are out there for the season, but why not go with the locals made here in the Upstate or in nearby Western North Carolina? Here are some suggestions. \nSwamp Rabbit Oktoberfest: The Travelers Rest brewery keeps this beer on all year, so you can enjoy a taste of autumn anytime. It’s a big malt-forward marzen with great German taste. So make the haul over there to enjoy some. At 7.4 percent alcohol, it packs a punch so get something to eat before you head home and don’t overdo it! \nBrewery 85’s Leon’s Lederhosen: It’s a true Bavarian-style Oktoberfest. Greenville’s Brewery 85 has done a great job in keeping with true old world tradition in its beers. With a nice orange hue, it clocks in at six percent alcohol. \nQuest Kermesse pumpkin saison: One of the Greenville brewer’s small batch beers, it takes its name from a Belgian harvest festival. Ingredients include fresh pumpkin, traditional spices and French Saison yeast. It’s 6.6 percent alcohol. e \nThomas Creek Oktoberfest: Another nice lager from a Greenville brewer. Hopped with Hallertauer Tradition and Spalter, you will find it widely sold around the upstate in 12 ounce bottle and on draft. \nCatawba King Don’s Pumpkin Ale: North Carolina brewer Catawba jumped on the pumpkin trend before it was a trend, and this beer is highly awaited each year. At 5.5 percent alcohol, this is an easy-drinking brew with pumpkin pie spice and a nice creamy head. Look for it on draft and in 12 ounce cans. \nHighland Clawhammer Oktoberfest: Made in Asheville it one of the great Oktoberfest seasonal beers out there. But it is fast running low in supply. Look for it in stores in ther in 12 ounce bottles or on draft. A terrific version of a German favorite and just five percent alcohol. \nNew Belgium Pumpkick Ale: These days, you’ve got to include New Belgium as an area brewery since they will soon open in West Asheville. This unusual tart and sour beer has pumpkin juice, cranberry, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and a little lemongrass, Look for it in six packs or 12 packs of 12 ounce bottles. Six percent alcohol. \nSierra Nevada Oktoberfest: This weekend, make the drive up to Mills River, just about an hour from Greenville to enjoy this great beer. Sierra hooked up with Brauhaus Riegele of Augsburg, Germany to make this superb marzen beers with all the malt-forward notes you 1 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://grnol.co/1RFX6Km", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T15:12:31.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
