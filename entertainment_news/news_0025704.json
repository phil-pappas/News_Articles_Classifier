And you have to wipe the tears from your cheeks and say the words that you were hoping to never have to say...Enough,\" Rory wrote about his 40-year-old wife in his blog post Friday .\n\"Joey had been feeling pretty good overall the last week or two, and was ready to start the next phase of treatment. This whole thing has been very hard on her, but she knows it's all part of getting better, so she's been a trooper and has stayed incredibly positive through it all. She'd done everything she was supposed to do. Followed every instruction that she'd been given and has taken every hard-knock that has come her way, and got back up and kept fighting,\" the message said.\nHowever, Rory said before Joey was scheduled to begin her next round of chemo last Thursday in Atlanta, she had a CT scan -- her first since surgery in July was believed to have removed all the cancer -- where it was revealed that two quarter-sized tumors had already grown back in the same area. Many smaller tumors were also visible throughout her abdominal region.\n\"[The doctor] said that the cancer was aggressively spreading in spite of all they've been doing. So we did what you do when the medicine isn't working, and the doctors are at a loss...and when the 'statistics' say you can do more chemo, but it will only buy you a little time... We came home,\" Rory wrote. \"Not to die. But to live. To put our hands in each others and sit out on the back porch and watch the sun set as our sweet little baby girl plays on a blanket in front of us. To bask in the glory of the beautiful life He's blessed us with, and try not to question why we can't have more of it together. And why He is allowing this to happen. The doctors gave us an estimate of how much time they believe that Joey has, and we both looked at the calendar that hangs by our kitchen door, then I took the calendar off the wall and threw in the trash can. So, we don't have forever. We've got right now.\"\nJoey was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2014. The disease later spread to her colon.\nThe Feeks have been married since 2002 and have one child, a toddler-age daughter. The couple form the country and bluegrass duo Joey + Rory.\n Justin Timberlake, Jessica Biel, Zachary Quinto honored at GLSEN Respect Awards ceremony 'Quiet Man' legend Maureen O'Hara dead at 95 Malia Obama gets apology from Brown University students regarding 'beer pong' tweets Harrison Ford drops in on couple's wedding via helicopter", "external_links": ["https://facebook.com/unitedpress", "http://thislifeilive.com/2015/10/", "https://www.facebook.com/UnitedPress", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/xcpjSMmWUDw"], "published": "2015-10-25T17:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T16:50:09.164+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
