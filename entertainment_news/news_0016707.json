Pete Rose \n“I’m going to have a whole lotta fun here,” MLB legend Pete Rose told me at Tuesday night grand’s opening of his 9,000-square-foot Pete Rose Bar and Grill at Hawaiian Marketplace on the Strip opposite Aria. \nPete, who lives a five-minute walk from his new breakfast, lunch and dinner spot, gave me a tour of the kitchen so that I could sample his three specials from chef Brian Littlejohn that represent the three cities he played for during his illustrious baseball career: \nCincinnati chili on spaghetti for the Cincinnati Reds, Philly cheese steak for the Philadelphia Phillies and his spin on the Canadian favorite poutine for the Montreal Expos. His poutine is French fries served with Wisconsin cheese curds topped with brown gravy. \n, absolutely delicious. Fabulous sports bar food! Our Q+A with Pete ahead of the grand opening was posted Oct. 2. \nHere’s Richard Corey’s YouTube video of Pete on the red carpet, in the kitchen and sitting down for my interview: \nESPN cameras filmed us as Pete told me: “We’re ticklish about the quality of the food and the quality of our service. It’s turned out the way I wanted — we’re still working on it; there are some little nicks we have to fix up, but I’m happy with it. I really like the people business. \n“There are not many places where you can come and watch sports. You can have a nice meal and take your time. When I had my restaurants in Florida, my brother was the head chef. I can’t cook, but I know what you’re supposed to do based on the ingredients you’re supposed to use. \n“I love the restaurant business. It always surprised me in Las Vegas the past nine years why no celebrity put their name on a restaurant. Star chefs, yes, but not celebrities except for Jimmy Buffet with Margaritaville, so I decided I’d do it. \n“I love signing autographs, so we may grow this to be more than one, maybe two, maybe three more restaurants. I’m for it. We’ve got 32 kinds of beers. My recommendation is try one of each, but don’t drive home! Walk home.” \nOur thanks to Jeff Ragazzo for his photo gallery of the grand opening, which included cast members of Chippendales at the Rio, Thunder From Down Under at Excalibur, “Rock of Ages” at the Venetian, “X Burlesque” and “X Comedy” at the Flamingo and “Jersey Boys” at Paris Las Vegas. \nRobin Leach of “Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous” fame has been a journalist for more than 50 years and has spent the past 15 years giving readers the inside scoop on Las Vegas, the world’s premier platinum playground. \nFollow Robin Leach on Twitter at Twitter.com/Robin_Leach . \nFollow Las Vegas Sun Entertainment + Luxury Senior Editor Don Chareunsy on Twitter at Twitter.com/VDLXEditorDon .
