Not advising Moses-like treks here from South Parkway or anything. 1892 also feels an extension of its quaint, village-like Five Points neighborhood. The atmosphere. The service. And especially the food. Surely it's by design.\n1892 debuted a new fall dinner menu here in Huntsville a few weeks ago and we stopped by on a recent Thursday evening to check it out. Two fish entrees were particularly impressive. The Stuffed Trout ($22) is built around a generous portion of pan-roasted North Carolina trout that's more folded than stuffed. No showy spices. Just natural, clean and compatible flavors. Flaky, tender, fresh fish. Subtle sweetness and woodsy texture from thinly sliced apples and onions. Augmented by a smooth horseradish beurre blanc. Served with fingerling potatoes that were creamy yet firm. Some deep-green broccolini to balance the plate out. Hearty, comfy eating.\nThe Salmon ($24) was also strong – grilled with very little seasoning to avoid stepping on the fresh, rich natural flavors and buttery texture. Some sweet pops from accompanying cherry tomatoes. Deftly cooked sautéed spinach. The roasted acorn squash risotto was dynamite - super cheesy, warm and comforting – aesthetics that heightened as sage and shallot compound butter seeped into the risotto. Our server, who was welcoming and passionate and knowledgeable about the menu, had recommended the Blackened Tenderloin ($26) as one of the menu's best items. I ordered it medium rare, and even though it came out more semi-Pittsburgh style than medium rare and pretty much all pink inside, following a 20-minute run earlier I was hungry enough and (cool enough with rare-ish) I didn't have it sent back to cook longer. Nice peppery char on the outside. A fist sized cut of beef. The accompanying roasted garlic cream sauce, which our server had justly touted, really set the rest of the plate off. Bites of steak were awesome dabbed into it. As were the creamy-firm fingerling potatoes and fresh side of green beans. You could probably dab an ashtray into this sauce, take a bite and be like, \"Not bad.\"\nEarlier, we'd started our well-paced meal with a Crispy Shrimp & Grits appetizer ($11), and it was out to the table lightning fast. Four deftly golden fried shrimp that you could still taste the gulf on. The Wright Dairy cheese grits the shrimp was stuffed with added texture but that's about the extent of it. We were expecting a little more flavor-wise, like some of the funkiness you get in shrimp and grits entrees. The accompanying smoked tomato dipping sauce was interesting though and definitely smoky. We probably should've consulted our server on apps because after my friend ordered the salmon and was interested in a glass of wine to pair with it, the server suggested a 2011 Mirambeau Bordeaux ($7), which benefited from a nice dry finish and subtle pear notes. And sidebar to veg-heads: 1892 East offers five vegetarian features, including Grilled Tempeh ($18) and Crispy Tofu ($16).\n1892's currant-colored dining room is cozy if not sexy. If you're looking for a slightly more sophisticated vibe you can find it at the bar, along with a well-curated local and regional heavy draft selection and Walt Whitman Quote: overhead. We tried the Good People Snake Handler Double India Pale Ale ($6). Big, clean hop bite there.\nFinished our meal with the Peaches and Cream Bread Pudding ($8), which was totally scrumptious - moist, dense, sweet - and served with vanilla ice-cream over a pool of delectable icing. Didn't detect much peach flavor in there more lemony. But that didn't stop me from continuing to stick my spoon into this stuff until there were just a few molecules remaining.\n1892 East Restaurant & Tavern\n720 Pratt Ave. N.E.\n256-489-1242\n1892east.com\nMonday – Friday: 11 a.m. – 2 p.m., 5 – 10 p.m.\nSaturday: 5 – 10 p.m., Sunday brunch: 10 a.m. – 2 p.m.\nRecommendations: Stuffed Trout, Salmon, Bread Pudding.\nSuggestions: For a more sexier vibe, sit at the bar.\nAlcohol: Full bar, well-curated draft beer list.\nAmbience: Quaint, village-like.\nService: Welcoming, passionate.\nVegetarian-friendly: Yes.\nPrice range: Most entrees $17-$26.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T07:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:39:14.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
