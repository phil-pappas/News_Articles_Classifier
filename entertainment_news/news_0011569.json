Beginning in the 1970s as a teenager, Lisa’s past life resurfaces 30 years later, causing her to become unsure of her marriage and the path she has chosen for herself. Eva also struggles with her own challenges to overcome alcohol addiction, financial troubles and lustful indulgences with men.\nLanga, a German freelance writer living in South Africa, channels her real-life, globe-hopping experiences as the wife of the former Ambassador of South Africa to China, highlighting how migration to and life in foreign countries affects and changes Lisa’s life, just as it has in her own.\n“My transition from Germany to South Africa in the early 1990s was a fascinating one, as Europe experienced the end of the Cold War and South Africa ended its Apartheid era,” Langa said. “I easily identify with Lisa as an expatriate who also emigrated from a small town in Germany to start a new life in another country.”\nIn her book, Langa also highlights the experiences and choices we make during childhood and adolescence, and how they ultimately affect our lives.\n“Everyone reacts differently to those life experiences, depending on who they are,” Langa said. “I hope that readers who are seeking direction in their lives are also able to look back and learn from those experiences.”\n“A Year in the Village”\nBy Petra Langa\nISBN: 978-1-5049-1217-4\nAvailable in softcover, hardcover, e-book\nAvailable on Amazon, Barnes & Noble and AuthorHouse\nAbout the author\nPetra Langa is a freelance writer and former lecturer in Pretoria, South Africa.
