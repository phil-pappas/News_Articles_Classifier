The Pittsburgh native was in town to perform at the University of Pittsburgh’s Midnight Madness Friday season kickoff and—who knows?—maybe he fell into some old habits while back on home turf. (We're just guessing at the back story to his nickname, we don't know—maybe he attended Hogwarts at some point, too.)\nWe give it up to Wiz for courageously living up to his handle, but someone should've let him know that public whizzing is illegal in every state. Also, “ making it rain ” won't hold up as a solid legal defense. And his birth name is Cameron, so he’s got that going against him too.\nRepresentatives for Mr. Khalifa have yet to release a statement about the incident.", "external_links": ["http://pagesix.com/2015/10/11/wiz-khalifa-cited-for-whizzing-in-public/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UePtoxDhJSw", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWHNr0BrNgo"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T21:10:48.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
