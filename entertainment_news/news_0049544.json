State Irrigation and Public health minister Vidya Stokes and Industries Minister Mukesh Agnihotri said that the Opposition was trying to destabilize the democratically elected government and dishonour the mandate given by the people, which indicate its sheer desperation and disregard towards the democracy. ”BJP should remember that the present Congress government had come to power through democratic process with full majority and it would complete its tenure under the dynamic leadership of Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh,” the ministers said.

The BJP was totally cornered on the issue of involvement of its leaders including its few Chief Ministers and senior Central ministers in various scams amounting to crores of rupees, they said The saffron party was making desperate bid to divert the attention of the people from the misdeeds of its own tainted ministers by mounting pressure for the resignation of Virbhadra Singh, which speaks of their double standards, they added. “Such unsuccessful attempts were made in the past also when false FIRs were registered against Virbhadra Singh by the state BJP leaders but the Chief Minister still remains one of the most popular Congress leaders in the country,” Agnihotri said. ”BJP is upset with overall and speedy development under his dynamic leadership and are frustrated after Virbhadra Singh?received massive support from the Congress high command,?state party unit, all his Cabinet colleagues, independent MLAs and above all the people of the state,” he added. \n  9:11 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T18:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:19:56.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
