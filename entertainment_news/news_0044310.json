Descended from the Thorndikes of South Thomaston, his immediate family has spent summers at Pleasant Beach since before the turn of the last century. Growing up, he was surrounded by his mother's paintings of coastal Maine and relished every trip to the Farnsworth Art Museum to see the Wyeth family paintings. \nGordon is self-taught and seldom uses “gimmicks” in his photography. He has an eye for composition and captures the subtleties of early morning and late afternoon light along the coast, as well as the magic created by the fog at dawn. \n“When I wake up, watch the sunrise over Spalding Island and see the Mussel Ridge islands illuminated in the most glorious light accompanied by the first morning calls of gulls, I understand why I need to return every year,” he said. \nThe gallery will be open through the end of the y ear, offering ample opportunity to view and acquire beautiful images of Maine by Gordon and numerous other photographers. The gallery is open Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. For more information, visit keagrivergallery.com or call 358-8687. The gallery is located at 25 Dublin Road, shortly past the left turn at the waterfront; Keag River Gallery is on the right. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
