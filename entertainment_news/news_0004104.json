Now, it's time to vote.\nWe've narrowed down the response to the top five haunt suggestions, nominated by our readers on syracuse.com and commenters on the Syracuse.com Facebook page.\nOthers also suggested Sylvan Beach, syracuse.com and \"some place that has copies of my student loans hanging on the walls,\" wrote commenter Tim Richards. Clever.\nVisit them all yourself, or read the nominations and vote on the winning haunt below.\n13th Hour Rising\nFrom syracuse.com commenter kathy : 13th Hour Rising is the best! A great family night out. The scenery/props are so creative and unique. The characters are on point. There is a concession stand and pumpkins for the kids.\nWhere: 84 Merrit Rd., Fulton.\nHow much: $14.\nCayo Industrial Horror Realm\nFrom syracuse.com commenter halloweener : Frightmare is nice, but for scares check out Cayo. Been going to both for 5 years.\nWhere: 811 Broad St., Utica.\nHow much: $10 for a single attraction and $20 for a double attraction.\nDemon Acres\nFrom Facebook commenter Sandy Meyer : Amazing location deep in the woods. It is creepy from the moment you pull up. The Hayride is so professional and excellent but The Demon's Den (house) is unbelievable...Filled with props and scares at every angle and it takes you at 15 minutes to complete it. Great actors at both.\nWhere: 341 County Route 36, Hannibal.\nHow much: Demon's Den is $12, Depths of the Dark Forest is $10 ($20 for both), Buried Alive is $5 and a VIP combo ticket is $35.\nFrightmare Farms\nFrom syracuse.com commenter katesev : Frightmare Farms is the scariest haunted house I have ever attended. I went last year with a group of friends. We all took turns going first through the attraction. The \"men\" of the group were reluctant and didn't want to go first because they were so scared! We screamed and laughed at ourselves until we peed our pants. I am so excited to go back this Saturday night! In my opinion, the VIP package is worth the money. The campfires, private areas, no waiting in line and event host make it so intimate.\nWhere: 4816 NY-49, Fulton (Palermo).\nHow much: $13 for each attraction, 46 for each additional attraction or a $35 VIP pass to skip the line for all three attractions.\nLandmark Theatre\n(Nominated on Facebook) No, this isn't a traditional haunted house, but the Landmark Theatre in downtown Syracuse does have a ghost story. The historic theatre, built in 1928, has had the people of Syracuse talking of haunting just years after it opened. After falling from a balcony to her death in 1930, Clarissa's spirit has been haunting the Landmark, often seen by workers and visitors. It's also part of a statewide tourism initiative called the Haunted History Trail of New York State .\nWhere: 362 S. Salina St., Syracuse.\nHow much: On Friday, Oct. 23 and Saturday, Oct. 24, the theater will open its doors for a pair of \"haunted tours.\" Tickets are $10, available via Ticketmaster.com or at the Landmark Theatre box office.\nVote now\nVoting will continue until the week of Halloween. We'll pay a visit to the winner.\nWhich is the scariest Halloween experience in Central New York?\nKatrina Tulloch writes features and entertainment stories for Syracuse.com and The Post-Standard.
