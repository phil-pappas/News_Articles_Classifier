Rose’s experience prompted her to write “To Catch a Rainbow-Connecting People, Play, and Places,” (published by AuthorHouse UK). This is a story about travel, diversity and international living which connects cultures across the globe through people, children’s play and places. A little girl, Rose, comes from two countries and travels the world with her parents wherever they have to work. Making friends seem easy and hard at the same time, packing bags gets tiring, while seeing new places is always an exciting adventure. Little Rose has become adaptable to change, but even then, international living while a great adventure is challenging. Rose’ full of life personality and her tact in adapting to difficult situations have been inspiring and one that many kids and families will relate to and/or learn from. To Catch a Rainbow symbolizes the existence of culturally diverse worlds that little Rose finds in all the countries she travels to. It signifies how people from all over the world are mingling all the time.\n“This book addresses an aspect of expatriate lifestyles - and to an extent- managed migration- all told from a child’s perspective,” the author says. “The world today faces a growing crisis on migration and how people react to foreigners. This is a story of people integrating positively in foreign countries. It can be a teaching guide on accepting others different from us and explains in simple language why people leave their home countries to live in foreign countries.”\n“To Catch a Rainbow,” fosters a positive message on how globalization is changing the face of national identities by connecting cultures and peoples through travel.\n“To Catch a Rainbow”\nBy Thandie M.V.\nSoftcover | 8.5 x 8.5in | 50 pages | ISBN 9781504945295\nE-Book | 50 pages | ISBN 9781504945301\nAvailable at Amazon and Barnes & Noble\nAbout the Author\nThandie Mwape Villadsen trained as a Journalist at Evelyn Hone College in Zambia and has a Master of Arts in Leading Innovation and Change from York St John University in England.
