Until now.The 75-year-old singer has recorded Bob Dylan's 'He Was Friend Of Mine' for his late friend and bodyguard Dai Perry on his new album Long Lost Suitcase, mainly because of the lyric \"never had much money to pay for his fine.\" © Getty Images / Tristan FewingsTom Jones at V Festival 2015 \"We got in trouble Caracas, Venezuela because the reporters were all over us,\" Tom explained to Digital Spy. \"This was in 1974 and we were in a press conference in a hotel. My publicist said to Dai, 'Get Tom through, he's not talking to any of the press, we'll do it at the hotel'. \"Well... Dave was like, 'Right, get the f**k out of the way' and then one reporter started kicking him in the back of the legs. So he lost it and he smacked him. \"I thought, 'Shit'. We get to the hotel and the manager said, 'You've got to get this kid out of the country.' It was late at night but once the court opened in the morning and the reporter files a complaint, they'll lock him up. \"In Latin law you were guilty until proven innocent, so he'd be in there for 30 days until his case comes up.\" © PA ImagesTom Jones Tom continued: \"So the manager in this Hilton we were staying at said that if we couldn't get him out on an early flight before the court opens, then we'll use the Hilton boat and get him to Barbados. But I had to pay his fine! \"I had to pay the judge off so I could get out as they then held me responsible for it. When I tried to leave they had taken my passport, so I had to do a deal with them.\"Eventually they managed to get Dai a flight to Miami, before Tom met back up with him in Vegas for his show.Tom Jones's new album Long Lost Suitcase is an accompaniment to his first authorised autobiography Over The Top and Back.The Welsh legend has covered some of his favourite hits to soundtrack certain moments and characters in his life.
