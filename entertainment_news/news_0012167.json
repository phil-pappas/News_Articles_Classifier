Now authorities are trying to retrace the moves Lamar Odom made before he ended up unconscious in a Nevada brothel. Officials in Nye County say they are trying to figure out what Odom took and when before he was found in his life-threatening situation. Meanwhile Odom's grandmother declined to say how he was doing -- saying she was upset by speculation that her grandson would be taken off life support. Odom's father also wouldn't discuss his son's condition. LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Clashing with the Kardashians? That seems to be what's happening with the owner of the Nevada brothel where Lamar Odom was found unconscious on Tuesday. Love Ranch owner Dennis Hof has been talking to reporters, revealing details about what Odom was doing at his brothel -- including the fact that he was taking herbal forms of the sexual performance drug Viagra and told brothel workers he'd used cocaine. Hof says Khloe Kardashian's reps have asked him to leave the talking to Odom's estranged wife. Hof says he's going to do what he must to protect his business. \nPITTSBURGH (AP) -- Another woman. Another defamation lawsuit against Bill Cosby. This suit is being filed in Pittsburgh by Renita Hill. She was on an educational children's show with the comedian as a teenager -- but says on several occasions, Cosby paid her way to performances, summoned her to his room, offered her an incapacitating beverage -- and molested her. Hill claims when she began refusing the drinks, Cosby told her she couldn't come to any more of his gigs. Her suit alleges Cosby defamed her when she went public with her story. BILL COSBY - MORE DEGREES PULLED \nBOSTON (AP) -- Maybe it would be easier if the all the colleges that plan to let Bill Cosby keep the honorary degrees they gave him would just say so. Instead, one by one -- sometimes two by two -- schools are announcing they are rescinding the degrees they gave the comedian over the years. It's all because of the sex assault scandal involving the comedian. The latest to pull honorary degrees: Tufts University in Massachusetts and Goucher College in Maryland. Both schools say they have notified Cosby of their actions. RANDY QUAID RELEASED FROM CUSTODY \nST. ALBANS, Vt. (AP) -- Randy Quaid can now find out whether it's easier to defend himself on a vandalism charge as a U.S. citizen than as a fugitive from American justice. The actor has been released from custody in Vermont, freeing him from his fugitive status.
