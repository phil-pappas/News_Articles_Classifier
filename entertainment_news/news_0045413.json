Related Content Eugenie Bouchard sues over U.S. Open... \nOdom was hospitalized Tuesday after he was found unconscious at the Love Ranch, where he had been holed up since Saturday. \nAfter being unresponsive for days, Odom said \"hi\" to his estranged wife, Khloe Kardashian, a source with knowledge of the situation said Friday. \nIt was unclear whether he remained conscious or how long he was awake. \nOdom's college coach, Jim Harrick, told CNN's Anderson Cooper that Kardashian told him she reached down to Odom on Friday and told him she loved him. Odom blinked, he said. \n\"He's awake now,\" Harrick said. \"So that's probably the most encouraging news we've had since it all started.\" \nOdom is using a mask to breathe and has serious damage to his vital organs, his former mother-in-law, Kris Jenner, told \"Access Hollywood.\" \n'Tiny bit' of improvement \nA source close to the situation told CNN on Friday the 35-year-old improved a \"tiny bit\" during his third night at Sunrise Hospital & Medical Center. \nOdom \"got a tiny bit better -- emphasis on tiny -- and he was responsive in the middle of the night for a moment,\" the source said. \nLittle is known about what left him unresponsive at the brothel in Crystal, where he was found Tuesday, three days after he checked in. \nMost of the information has come from Dennis Hof, owner of the Love Ranch, where the former basketball player was found. \nDrugs and money \nIn three days at the brothel, Odom spent $75,000, which guaranteed two women would \"take care of any of his needs,\" Hof told CNN's sister network HLN. \nHe used cocaine on his first day at the brothel Saturday, employees told 911 dispatchers. A woman said she also saw him take 10 herbal supplement tablets over three days. \nThe brothel's employees said when they found him, Odom was lying in bed on his side with a pinkish fluid coming from his mouth and nose. \nFour teams, 14 seasons \nOdom won two NBA championships as a forward for the Los Angeles Lakers. \nHe played for four teams during his 14 seasons in the NBA and won the Sixth Man of the Year Award during the 2010-11 season. \nThe Los Angeles Clippers drafted him in 1999, and he played for the team for four seasons before signing with the Miami Heat. \nAfter one season in Miami, he was traded to the Lakers, and became a key part of their championship teams in 2009 and 2010. \nHe also played briefly for the Dallas Mavericks before returning to the Clippers for one season. \nFamous in-laws \nOdom and Khloe Kardashian got married in 2009 -- and filed for divorce four years later, citing irreconcilable differences. \nIn addition to appearing on \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians,\" the couple had their own reality show, \"Khloe & Lamar.\" It lasted for two seasons and 20 episodes. ‹previous", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T11:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:12:13.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
