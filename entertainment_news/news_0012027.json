She is scorned by her husband and neighbours, and is soon left without her son.\nBut day by day she becomes more convinced that a better future can only be built on a platform of female rights, and most importantly, the right to vote.\nBeyond the politics, the film also gives an insight into the lives of working-class women of the time.\nIt was a life in which \"marriage was allowed at 12,\" and in which a married woman \"had no further claim to not only her name, but any property she brought to the marriage,\" explained Streep.\nMulligan said she was drawn to the film as \"it didn't feel like a documentary about a time, it felt like a film about today\".\n\"It's a film to mark the achievement of what these women did and what they gave to us,\" she added.\n\"And also to highlight... that we still live in a society that's sexist.\"\n'Not in the history books' \nDirector Gavron said it was important to bring the struggle, which led to universal suffrage in 1928, to the big screen as it had been \"written out of our history\".\n\"It took a long time to get it on the school curriculum,\" she added. \"I wasn't taught anything about it and later read a few lines at the bottom of a history book\".\nAsked about her own feminist credentials, Streep recounted one of the film's slogans: \"Deeds not words\".\nThe film, which will be released in Britain on October 12 and the US on October 23, ends with a poignant list of the dates women earned voting rights across the world, including Finland in 1906, France in 1944, Switzerland in 1971 and Saudi Arabia in 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:18:14.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
