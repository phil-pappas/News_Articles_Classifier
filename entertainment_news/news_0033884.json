The meeting to start it all will be at 7 p.m. Nov. 10 in the WWCC Music Room. The one-act plays will all be written and rehearsed within a 24-hour time period. Interested participants should come prepared to be “cast” as a writer, actor or director. Musicians, dancers and artists are encouraged to attend the meeting to provide interludes between the plays created in the 24-hour time period. After assignments are determined, the writers will have 12 hours to write a 5- to 10-minute play. Writers may work individually or in groups. After the script is complete, the directors and actors will have 12 hours to prepare their one-act play. After 24 hours of writing and rehearsal, the original one-act plays will be performed. The performance will be 7 p.m. Nov. 11 in the WWCC Performing Arts Auditorium. Admission is free. For more information, contact Julie Jones at julie.jones@wwcc.edu or 509-524-5160.
