But there's another side to fear that's fun and fulfilling,\" and that's the sweet spot sought by recreational activities — whether skydiving, ziplining, roller coasters or haunted houses. \n\"When we know we're not really in any physical danger, we can enjoy the endorphins and the dopamine. That response is similar to being really excited and happy,\" she said. \nHer quest for the \"Scream\" book took her on \"many, many adventures across the world, doing as many scary and thrilling things as I could. I look at it from the cultural perspective, the physiological perspective and the psychological perspective: Why do we engage with this type of material? Part of it is the natural high we get from activating the flight-or-fight response in a safe environment.\" \nKerr says the trick is to figure out what types of situations \"trigger our flight or fight response. What are people afraid of, what's going to tap into the fear?\" \nFor example, \"we know from science that seeing the whites of people's eyes will activate the amygdala — the emotional processing center of our brain.\" That intense response to another being's eyes explains why scary attractions often have \"dolls with big eyes or animatronics with wide-open eyes.\" Startling sounds, fast-moving props and other sudden visual effects also trigger instinctive responses, upping the fear factor without putting people in real danger. \nShe added that part of the draw for an extreme adventure or attraction is that \"you are testing your own resilience. When you come out the other side of a scary movie or haunted house, you have accomplished something. You've tested your will. Even though we know nothing will hurt us, the self-esteem boost is real.\" \nAs for her own responses, she found the CN Tower Edgewalk to be \"way more terrifying than I thought it would be.\" Skydiving, on the other hand, was pure pleasure for Kerr. \nKerr says her research can have implications beyond theme parks and haunted houses by helping people understand how to tolerate stress. \"We're trying to find the best ways to teach people how to experience their emotions in ways that are healthy and not debilitating,\" she said. \"When people lean into the experience and test themselves in an environment that is safe, they come to learn they can handle stress and they are stronger than they thought they were.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T00:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:45:28.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
