But not Cooper.\n“I was in the process of losing 40 pounds,” the “American Sniper” star explained, to appear onstage in “The Elephant Man.” “It was kind of a nightmare.”\nIn “Burnt,” Cooper plays Adam Jones, a world-famous chef fresh from rehab and eager to regain his reputation by nabbing the highest possible honor any restaurant can achieve: three Michelin stars.\nBut troubled by rages and outbursts leveled at his staff, Adam is perpetually on edge.\n“I did a tremendous amount of research and speaking to people in that world, and I think the movie is actually pretty tame,” Cooper, 40, said at the London Hotel.\n“Adam is all self-loathing. When he’s screaming (at everyone), he’s really screaming at himself.\n“I could relate to his obsession to do the best he can. But more than any other character I’ve played, I saw how different we are.\n“Because he’s lost the joy in what he did.\n“That’s a hell of a thing to lose. Food is so joyful, and he’s lost joy in cooking, which is where he is for so much of the movie.”\n(“Burnt” opens Friday.)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?text=Bradley+Cooper+cooks+up+enthusiasm+for+role+as+chef+in+%60Burnt%27"], "published": "2015-10-26T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:22:30.370+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
