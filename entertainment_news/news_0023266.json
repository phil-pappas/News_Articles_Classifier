Witnesses said a plate of glass had instead shattered in a \"floral\" pattern, but remained intact.\nThe broken glass sent tourists screaming and running for their lives to get off the walkway, but officials said the tourists were never in any danger during the incident. They said the two remaining layers of glass would have been sufficient to support the weight of the visitors.\nCopyright 2015 by United Press International Share Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1734116&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1734116", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1734116&h=Tourists+flee+as+Chinese+mountain%27s+glass+walkway+cracks"], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:07:03.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
