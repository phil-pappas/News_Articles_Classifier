His identity is being withheld pending notification of his family. The second victim was in stable condition at a Houston-area hospital, she said.\n\"It's crazy,\" Pickens said. \"It's broad daylight.\"\nSchool officials initially said that three \"persons of interest\" had been detained by Houston police. In a statement issued later Friday, the school said only two were in custody.\nThe suspected shooter remains at large, according to the university statement.\nIt was not clear if any of the people sought by police were students or how they were connected to the university. A department spokesman said he could not provide any additional information about a suspect or the shooting.\nA motive for the shooting remained unclear. Classes were canceled for the rest of the day.\nThe incident was the second shooting on campus in just 12 hours. A shooting left one person injured outside the same dormitory around midnight Thursday, according to a statement issued by the school.\nStudents are not allowed to carry firearms on campus, Pickens said. A motive in the shooting was not immediately clear.\nThe shooting comes as a wave of gun violence on college campuses throughout the U.S. has reignited a debate over gun control and laws that block students from carrying firearms on campus.\nEarlier on Friday, an argument at Northern Arizona University sparked a shooting that left one student dead and three injured. Last week, a gunman opened fire on the campus of Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., killing nine and wounding nine others.\nPresident Barack Obama, who made an impassioned plea for lawmakers to consider passing gun control legislation after the Oregon shooting, visited with the families of the victims of that attack on Friday.\n(c)2015 Los Angeles Times\nVisit the Los Angeles Times at www.latimes.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nGRAPHIC (for help with images, contact 312-222-4194): 20151009 Texas shooting\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1735430&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1735430&h=1+dead%2C+1+injured+in+shooting+at+Texas+Southern+University", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1735430"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T01:13:17.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
