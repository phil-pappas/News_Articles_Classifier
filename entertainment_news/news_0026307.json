But we understand why the Temecula charter school Keegan Academy recently sued the Temecula Valley Unified School District.\nAfter operating the charter for three school years, the school district decided in June 2013 not to renew Keegan’s charter. In a staff report, the district maintained that Keegan failed to comply with a certain corrective action plan.\nSonja Clause, the charter school’s executive director, asserts that Keegan didn’t know what needed to be corrected because the district never specified an infraction.\nInstead, the district required extensive financial reporting, including every invoice and contract, which, according to Ms. Clause, was far beyond what customarily is required of charter schools like Keegan.\nSince Ms. Clause had the temerity not to comply with what she thought an onerous diktat, the school district effectively shut the charter school down.\nThat prompted Keegan to partner with another charter school, the Thousand Oaks-based Academy of Arts and Sciences, to run a learning center out of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Southwest County Clubhouse.\nThat ensured that the district’s decision did not have an especially deleterious impact on Keegan’s enrollees, which at peak numbered 108 kindergarteners to eighth-graders.\nIn a statement addressing Keegan’s lawsuit, the district insisted, “TVUSD did not force the closure of The Keegan Academy when its charter expired in June 2013, and has not at any time otherwise ‘forced’ the closure of Keegan Academy.”\nThat strikes us as disingenuous on the district’s part. For by deciding not to renew Keegan’s charter, the district effectively forced the charter school’s closure.\nYes, Keegan operated during the 2013-14 and 2014-15 school years in partnership with the Academy of Arts and Sciences. But Keegan is not a charter school in its own right.\nIndeed, that’s why Ms. Clause this past February submitted a new charter petition to the school district. And after an 11-week petition consideration process, the district refused to grant Keegan a charter.\nNow had the former charter school a bad track record in educating students, had it so incompetently managed its finances it was listing toward bankruptcy, we would think the school district did the right thing shutting Keegan down.\nBut we see no hard evidence that Ms. Clause and her staff were shortchanging their students scholastically, or that they egregiously mismanaged Keegan’s finances.\nWe look forward to a ruling by an impartial Riverside County Superior Court judge.\nWRITE A LETTER TO THE EDITOR: Letters to the Editor: E-mail to letters@pe.com .
