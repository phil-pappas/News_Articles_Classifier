Tickets for these all-inclusive concerts went on sale in early September and quickly sold out. The tickets include a stay at the Barceló Maya Beach Resort – where the concerts will be held – or one of three other nearby resorts, as well as food, drinks, and resort activities.\n“Phish is an amazing group that has never been truly appreciated by the main stream music crowd,” Rob Lee, co-owner of Swift Passport Services commented. “This band is known for jam sessions that are incredibly inventive and powerful. Even without major radio hits, they’ve managed to build an extremely loyal fan base and sell over eight million albums.”\nThough tickets for the Phish concert in Mexico have already sold out, ticketholders will need to make sure they have a valid passport before heading down to Riviera Maya. Swift hopes to make that process easier for Phish fans with their “Phishing for Passports” program.\nFrom now until January 1, 2016, anyone attending one of the three Phish Riviera Maya concerts can renew or obtain a new passport through Swift in just seven to ten business days for an expediting fee of only $50. (Note that US passports currently require a $170 US State Department fee. Return shipping costs may also apply.) Swift’s hope is that this program will help fans get a passport for the Phish concert in Mexico more easily and much more quickly than they could on their own.\n“Passports are one of those things that people tend to put somewhere ‘safe’ and then lose completely. It happens all the time. A lot of people also realize only days before international trips that their passport has expired,” Lee noted. “If you ever find yourself in this sort of situation, Swift should be your first call. We can replace a passport or get you your first one in as little as one to three business days.”\nPhish fans in need of a new passport can contact Swift by calling (877) 917-9438 or through http://www.swiftpassportservices.com .
