He says, \"This journey is new as well as old. New, because the music video will put me as an artist in a different light and old because I have not just heard it but also sang it and many times in fact. Hence, I decided to make a video to reach out to new audiences who wanted to experience the music visually and soak in the feel. A music video project was on my mind since long and I decided to start it by offering this ' Garabo' to Maa Shakti .'\nGiving more insight on the project and juggling various hats, as a a singer, performer and conceptualiser for the project, Parthiv adds, \"When we decided on the shoot, we chose to keep it as ethnic as possible. We researched about how people used to play or sing ' Garabo ' originally, the costumes of yesteryears, traditions, myths and stories connected to it. We made it a point that all this was to be reflected in the video.\"\nThere are various names from the industry that are associated with making Garabo a reality. Sumeet Mascarenhas has arranged the rhythm, Aditya Dev has done symphonic arrangement and Akshay-Aakash have arranged music programming. Efforts from such stalwarts of the industry have made Garabo supremely energetic and anyone who will watch or listen to it will certainly feel the energy and positivity.\nHe fondly dedicates Garabo to his mother, as \"she is the one who always faced the adversities of life with courage, and she gave me mettle to deal with any situations of life.\"\nFor latest Music updates follow us on Twitter >>> @TOIEntertain\nFor the latest in Music news, like us on Facebook >>> TOIEntertain\nFor more interesting Music news and pictures follow us on Pinterest>>> timesofindia\nFor latest Music updates follow us on G+ >>> The Times of India Entertainment\nWATCH: \"GARBO\" The Divinity Within Humanity (Full Song)", "external_links": ["http://gaana.com/search/songs/Parthiv%20Gohil", "https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/I5U_y-lvvas", "https://www.pinterest.com/timesofindia/", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107628521107103264647/+TOIEntertainment/posts", "https://twitter.com/TOIEntertain"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T15:37:37.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
