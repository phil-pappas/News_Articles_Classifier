At the end of the event, addressing 60,000 students, Modi had cheered, \"I salute you... May the Force be with you,\" a popular Quote: from 'Star Wars'.\nREAD: Passing on claws: Hugh Jackman thinks Tom Hardy would be 'great Wolverine'\nSpeaking from Hong Kong, Hugh told Mirror, \" He's a funny guy! I heard his speech and figured people love him . He even Quote: d 'Star Wars' in his speech, which was cool. But I sincerely hope he remembers a line by 'Wolverine' the next time. Modi, sure looks like someone who's having a great time in America.\"\nThe 46-year-old Australian-native, best known as 'Wolverine' from the 'X-Men' series, will next be seen as the fearsome pirate 'Blackbeard', in Joe Wright's fantasy-adventure film, 'Pan', a prequel to Scottish author J M Barrie's much-loved 1904 story Peter Pan.\n\"Peter Pan is one of those seminal stories that is known by all ages in all countries. It's universal, and in creating an origin for Peter, I think Joe really hooked into the inner child within all of us,\" Hugh says, adding that 12-year-old Levi Miller does a fine job as a young Peter Pan. \"He's an Australian too and didn't seem intimidated by me at all.On our first day on the set, he called me \"Sir\" and I said \"Let's just stick to Hugh, ok mate?\" But we had to settle for \"Mr Hugh Jackman\". It was intimidating, but he wouldn't nudge,\" Hugh laughs.\nFor the film, which releases in India on October 9, writer Jason Fuchs expanded on a grain of information about Blackbeard, from the book to create a bad guy, which the director said would be played by the \"nicest man in show business, Hugh Jackman.\"\nConfirming the same, the actor adds. \"I've played bad guys before, but not one quite this bad. Not only is he wicked and cruel, he also loves to hear himself talk, make speeches and use big words. He thinks he's very important, and he is scary, but he's having a good time and that made him a fun character to play,\" he adds.\nThe actor says that shaking a leg as Blackbeard reminded him of the time he had partied with Shah Rukh Khan. \"I met him in Fiji and he taught me some Bollywood moves, which you'll see me doing in the film. There's singing and dancing and colours like the ones I saw in India,\" says Hugh, who had visited Rajasthan and Delhi on a five-day trip over a decade ago. \"I will be back, this time with my wife (Deborra-Lee Furness),\" he says. Jackman, who got married in 1996, had personally designed the wedding rings, which bore the Sanskrit inscription, \"Om paramar mainamar,\" translating to \"We dedicate our union to a greater source...\"\nHuge says, \"I'm fascinated by your country and intrigued by the history and culture.This time, I'd like to take my wife to the South of India to study ancient Vedic texts. I am also enamoured by the spicy food.\" He adds that he'd love to be a part of Mumbai's Comic Con, and dress up as Wolverine. \"I am well aware of the fan following I have in Mumbai.\"\nHuge is keen to fly down to India with Broadway To Oz, a concert-stage show, scheduled to hit five Australian cities next month. \"It's a personal journey through my life, from my early days in Outback Australia, through successes in musical theatre and Hollywood stardom.\" The actor is polishing his dancing skills for the tour, and will be accompanied by 150 musicians and dancers. \"But I'm not singing, yet,\" he insists.\nThe actor is also inspired by Sachin Tendulkar. \"He's like Don Bradman, the greatest player that the game has seen. It's that sense of being a gentleman at all times that makes him who he is,\" Hugh says, recalling a story an Australian cricketer, who played with Tendulkar during an IPL match, shared with him. \"They were in a team bus after a match, and a huge crowd gathered outside to cheer for Sachin. This player closed Sachin's curtain in a gesture to say, \"I'll give you a break.\" Sachin pulled the curtain back, waved at the crowd and turned around and told him, 'Never forget that we are here because of them.' This inspires me every single day,\" Hugh said, adding that he'd love to have the superpower of 'Teleportation'. \"Only, so that I could teleport to India to have lunch with all these people I keep hearing so much about,\" he reasons.\nJackman signs off admitting it's time he hung up his 'Wolverine' gear, after playing Logan through seven films. He will make his final appearance in the third instalment of the franchise next year. \"Tom Hardy was the first name that came to my mind as the next Logan,\" says Hugh. \"Getting over 'Wolverine' will not be difficult for me. I'm not that type of a guy who says, oh... only I should've played Wolverine,\" he says.\nFor latest Hollywood updates follow us on Twitter >>> @TOIEntertain\nFor the latest in Hollywood news, like us on Facebook >>> TOIEntertain\nFor more interesting Hollywood news and pictures follow us on Pinterest>>> timesofindia\nFor latest Hollywood updates follow us on G+ >>> The Times of India Entertainment\nWATCH: Hugh Jackman | Love the Idea of Exploring the World Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107628521107103264647/+TOIEntertainment/posts", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/KQgCtdEZFb8", "https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain"], "published": "2015-10-08T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:20:56.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
