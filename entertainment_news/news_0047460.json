The site curates data from millions of established as well as upcoming artists resulting in a unique and amazing experience for music aficionados in all music genres.\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151005/274329LOGO\nIn just 3 months since its release, Kurrent Music has amassed over 1000 articles, interviews, and reviews in different music genres such as indie, hip/hop, R&B and classical music featuring dozens of writers in more than 10 countries including US, UK, Canada , China , Mexico , Italy , Brazil , Jamaica , Ghana , Serbia, Ukraine , India , Philippines and Venezuela .\n\"Kurrent is the future of music blogging, consumption, and research. We're revolutionizing the music blog through democratization, and, more importantly facilitating discovery and exploration of the industry itself. Kurrent adapts to your tastes, making it an amazing tool for all music fans. I can't wait to see what's down the road for us,\" explains Danny Garcia , who is currently studying Music Business and Production at the prestigious Clive Davis Institute of Recording Music at NYU Tisch School of the Arts .\nRene Garcia's small software firm, based in Boca Raton FL , has been creating software components for developers for over twenty years; he offers a more technical perspective on Kurrent Music:\n\"At first, I was just helping Danny jumpstart his music blog in a popular blogging platform, but when I took a closer look at its limitations I realized there was a huge opportunity to leverage some of the APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) available in the music industry to create an information mash and a whole music blogging technology platform around this data. The results are just amazing and you are only seeing the tip of the iceberg. At Kurrent Music we are just starting to explore new ways our curated data can be leveraged to provide a whole new experience when listening, watching or reading about music, it's very exciting!\" concluded Mr. Garcia.\nPallas Loredo provides additional feedback from a blogger's perspective, \"One of the great things about Kurrent Music is that the content available is extremely diverse; there are countless genres of music that are covered on the blog. And if, by chance, you cannot find any articles on the genre of your choice, the Kurrent platform is designed so that anyone can fill that void. This unique website gives those with a voice/opinion/passion towards music a place to express said voice or opinion. Kurrent Music takes care of the layout, graphics, and the technological details one would not even consider, so that the writer can put their focus on what's important, which is (of course), their creative content.\"\nKurrent Music can be accessed at www.kurrentmusic.com where you can sign up to be a blogger or a user free of charge; you can also reach them via Email .\nMedia Contact:\nRene Garcia\n5612991761\n releases/fatherson-unveil-a-revolutionary-blogging-platform-opening-the-world-of-music-for-everyone-300154756.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.kurrentmusic.com/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151005/274329LOGO", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=PH20699&Transmission_Id=201510060830PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH20699&DateId=20151006", "http://pressreleaseheadlines.com/contact?pid=291766", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fatherson-unveil-a-revolutionary-blogging-platform-opening-the-world-of-music-for-everyone-300154756.html"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T17:48:57.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
