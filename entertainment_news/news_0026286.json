And you can forget the pecans, or add walnuts or no nuts at all.\nBodacious Banana-Carrot Bread. Contributed by Divas of Dish It’s a little bit healthy, a whole lot delicious.\nBODACIOUS BANANA-CARROT BREAD\n1 cup very ripe bananas, mashed (about 3 bananas)\n1 cup brown sugar\n3/4 cup vegetable oil\n2 eggs\n2 cups flour\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1 cup finely chopped or grated carrots\n1 cup chopped pecans\nPreheat oven to 350°F. Grease and flour a 9 x 5 x 3-inch loaf pan.\nCombine bananas, sugar, oil and eggs with electric mixer on medium until well mixed, about 2 minutes. Add flour, baking soda and salt with mixer on low until just incorporated. Stir in carrots and pecans.\nPour into prepared pan and bake 45-50 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Set aside to cool on a rack for 15 minutes; remove from pan, invert onto rack and cool completely before slicing. Makes 9-inch loaf\nDiva confession: Loaf pans come in a variety of sizes, and in materials including glass, ceramic and metal. We baked in a metal pan, but if you’re using a glass pan, adjust accordingly: Glass transfers heat quicker than metal, which shortens baking time but can cause bread to undercook in the center and overcook on the outside. If you’re using glass, lower the oven temperature by 25 degrees.\n</span", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/12/ef/8d/Divas-banana-carrot-bread.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:05:33.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
