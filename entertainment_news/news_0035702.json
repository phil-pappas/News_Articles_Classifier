The medical team working on Lamar conducted a series of brain scans on him and discovered the strokes. Luckily, they did not affect any of his vital organs. \nThe doctors have not confirmed whether the damage to Lamar’s mobility and speech would be permanent or not. Lamar is set to go through months of physical therapy to help him to regain his full physical capacities but according to TMZ. But there’s no definite prognosis on whether he will ever be completely back to normal. Lamar Odom suffered 12 strokes and his kidneys are failing, according to TMZ. Photo by Michael Loccisano/ Getty Images \nThe main challenge facing Lamar Odom right now is the fact that his kidneys are failing. He’s currently on dialysis and may need a transplant. \nIf he does need a new kidney, Lamar Odom probably won’t have to look very far. Since the news of the possible kidney transplant broke, fans have been offering Odom their kidneys via social media, Yahoo Health reports. \n@khloekardashian – My blood type is O Negative. I can donate my kidney. I just want Lamar to get better.  \n— Cindy Lartigue (@CindyLartigue1) October 23, 2015 \n@khloekardashian if Lamar is A+ I’ll donate my kidney for free. — Lauren Ackerman (@Sarcasticack) October 23, 2015 \nIf Lamar Odom needs a kidney, I will gladly give up one of mine without a second thought. Mistakes do not define us. #SecondChance #Believe \n— GoingBreezyMode (@TheKnifingGhost) October 20, 2015 \nThis isn’t the first time that kidneys have been sought out via social media, Yahoo Health reports. But usually the person who is seeking the kidney asks their social networks to make the donation. Lamar and his doctors will probably look to their family first for the kidney instead of finding it via strangers on social media. Some people aren’t too enthused that Lamar is getting so many willing organ donors. Most of the contention has to do with the fact that Lamar damaged his kidneys through drug abuse. \n@TheKnifingGhost maybe you should consider giving to someone else in need of one who hasn’t ruin theirs on by their own choices, maybe a kid — Becky M (@chloefire21) October 24, 2015 \nIf #LamarOdom gets a kidney before @TheSoulbrother , there’s gonna be a protest! \n— Shannon Burke (@TheShannonBurke) October 21, 2015 \nSince only one kidney is needed to replace two failed kidneys, a live donor can do a kidney transplant. According to Yahoo Health , the recovery from a kidney donation can be very taxing and can take up to two weeks of recovery time. \nLamar Odom was found unconscious at the Love Ranch, a brothel in Las Vegas on October 13. \nAccording to the Daily Mail , Love Ranch owner Dennis Hof has said that Odom first came to the ranch on October 10 and that he planned to stay there for four days. He reportedly spent $75,000 on two women who spent time with the former Los Angeles Laker in a VIP suite. Khloe Kardashian and Lamar Odom in happier times. Photo by Michael Buckner/Getty Images \nThough the couple have spent the last couple of years on the brink of divorce, Khloe Kardashian and Lamar Odom have had a bit of a reconciliation since his medical crisis. Several media outlets have reported that Khloe has been at Lamar’s side since he’s been hospitalized. Khloe and Lamar have also called off their divorce, according to this article in US Weekly . They had both signed the divorce papers but the court had not processed them as yet. Khloe Kardashian’s lawyer has asked the court to rescind the divorce filing however which means that the divorce is off the table for now. \nKhloe recently released a statement thanking her fans and loved ones for the support during this difficult time for her and Lamar. \nThe past week has been so difficult,” Khloe said. ‘I am so thankful to family, friends and fans, who have sent nothing but prayers and well wishes to Lamar.’ \n[Photo by Lisa Maree Williams/Getty Images]", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T19:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T19:18:55.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
