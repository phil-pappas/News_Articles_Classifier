(Chase Stevens/Las  ) Related links Like Neon Las Vegas on Facebook: By Christopher LawrenceLas   \nMTV finally confirmed one of downtown Las Vegas’ worst-kept secrets : “The Real World” is back in town. \nProduction for the reality show’s 31st season kicked off Monday at the Gold Spike. \nIt’s the third time the true story of seven strangers who find out what happens when people stop being polite and start getting real has come to Las Vegas. And, as opposed to the houses and warehouses the show converts in every other city \"The Real World\" has called home, it’s the third time the action is taking place in a hotel. \nDebuting in September 2002, the 12th season of “The Real World” turned the recently opened Palms into a destination for 20-somethings. That cast -- Steven, Trishelle, Frank, Brynn, Alton, Arissa and Irulan -- proved so popular, they were brought back together in their Palms suite for two weeks in 2007 to tape the six-episode \"Reunited: The Real World Vegas.\" It remains the show’s only full-fledged reunion. \nEight cast members moved into a custom suite at the Hard Rock Hotel for the 25th season that aired in 2011. The eighth roommate was called in after cast member Adam Royer was evicted and charged for damages to the suite. According to MTV at the time, the hotel sent him a bill for $3,105 for replacements and repairs, including a “biohazard deep clean.” \nNow the action has moved to the newly renovated penthouse at the Gold Spike, which at least should ensure that viewers see a different side of Las Vegas. Because, compared to the downtime the show has taken between revisiting other cities, it seems like “The Real World” just left town. \nOf the locales that spawned multiple casts, “The Real World” spent seasons one, 10 and 21 in New York. Seasons two and 20 were based in Los Angeles. Seasons three and 29 took place in San Francisco. And seasons 11 and 30 were housed in Chicago. \nContact Christopher Lawrence at clawrence@reviewjournal.com Find him Twitter: @Life_OntheCouch Comment section guidelines The below comment section contains thoughts and opinions from users that in no way represent the views of the Las   or GateHouse Media.
