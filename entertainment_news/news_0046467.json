(AP) - A 650-pound pig that fell off a trailer in Colorado is getting a new name -- \"Lucky\" -- and a new home at a sanctuary for abandoned pigs.\nThe Daily Times-Call reports ( http://bit.ly/1hsk5eM ) that Lucky rolled onto Interstate 25 on Sept. 30. He was probably destined for a slaughterhouse, but will instead be headed to a cozy home east of Denver.\nThe Weld County Sheriff's Office couldn't find the 3-year-old pig's owner, so the boar was given to Hog Haven Farm owner and director Erin Brinkley-Burgardt.\nBrinkley-Burgardt says she primarily cares for pot-bellied pigs, which people buy as pets but often abandon as they grow larger. The veterinarian who treated Lucky says he appears to be a Yorkshire pig.\nBrinkley-Burgardt says Lucky can expect to live about 13 years in captivity.\n___\nInformation from: Daily Times-Call, http://timescall.com/\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1hsk5eM", "http://timescall.com/"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:15:07.301+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
