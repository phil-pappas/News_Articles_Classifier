According to Deadline , Alec and Demi will play lovers in indie movie \"Blind\". The pair are joined by Dylan McDermott . Directed by Michael Mailer, \"Blind\" centers on a novelist (Alec) who was blinded in a car crash that killed his wife. Several years later, he rediscovers his love of writing when he falls in love with the neglected wife (Demi) of an indicted businessman (Dylan). John Mailer wrote the script from a story by Diane Fisher. Michael and Diane are producing the project along with Jennifer Gelfer and Pamela Thur. Alec and Mallory Schwartz, meanwhile, will serve as exec producers. The film is slated to shoot in New York. Michael said in a statement, \" 'Blind' has been a long gestating project. But to have the superb cast that I have, my brother as the writer, and a very talented group of producers surrounding me I can say with true conviction it was worth the wait.\" Alec and Demi previously played adversaries in 1996's thriller \"The Juror\". In the movie, Demi starred as a single mother picked for jury duty for a mafia trial, while Alec was a mobster sent to intimidate her. Alec will next be seen in three movies, medical drama thriller \" Concussion (2015) \" along with Will Smith , untitled Warren Beatty project along with Alden Ehrenreich and Lily Collins , and \" Boss Baby \" along with Kevin Spacey .
