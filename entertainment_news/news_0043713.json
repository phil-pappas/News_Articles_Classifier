I don’t think that’s legal, it shouldn’t be legal. Please do something.”\nThree months ago, Anaheim-based Sierra Corporate Management purchased Corona La Linda Mobile Home Park, which borders the Home Gardens area at 777 S. Temescal St. Since then, residents say the price for new rentals has doubled, to $1,300 per month. A park employee, who would not give their name, confirmed the new rate but would not comment on pre-existing rentals.\nAbe Arrigotti, Sierra president, did not return messages.\nResidents asked the council to enact rent control. Mayor Eugene Montanez suggested park residents speak with a state legislator who could then contact the city attorney to potentially pursue such measures.\nZeke Dasecke, a retired Corona mail carrier who’s lived at the park for more than a decade, called for quick action such as a temporary moratorium on rent hikes, saying he and other seniors with fixed income are in immediate danger of losing their homes.\n“There’s no way we can pay $1,300 per month for a mobile home community,” an emotional Dasecke said. “I’d hate to lose my home.”\nOnly the lots, most a half-acre in size, are rented from Sierra. The more than 100 trailers are owned by the people who live in them, ex-owner/operator Richard Dixon said.\nOther residents told the council it was too expensive to move their trailers, and that selling was impossible given the rental spike.\nThe park was recently assessed at $3.1 million, Dixon said. Sierra paid $16.7 million for it.\nDixon, one of several landowners who agreed to the deal, said he felt forced to comply with the majority decision.\n“I have the feeling the new owners are about as aggressive as they can be,” Dixon said. “I personally feel terrible for having done the deal.”\nContact the writer: 951-368-9644, poneill@pe.com , @PE_PatrickO", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvxd4k-b88535288z.120151008162417000gv4cfnst.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvxd4k-b88535288z.120151008162417000gv4cfnst.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:23:45.234+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
