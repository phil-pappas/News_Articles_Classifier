That was the first thing I said to Danny. I said, 'Christian Bale looks a lot more like Steve Jobs than me.' \n''He wasn't interested in that - he wanted to get the energy and essence of the man and go with that.'' \nDespite playing the man who gave the world the iPod, iPad and iPhone, Fassbender has confessed he's not very good with technology and uses it ''pretty poorly'' on a day-to-day basis in his life. \nHe said: ''I'm not very interested in technology. I use it pretty poorly. So everything was new to me, to be honest.'' \nFassbender stars in 'Steve Jobs' with Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen and Jeff Daniels and the movie is released across the US at the end of October.
