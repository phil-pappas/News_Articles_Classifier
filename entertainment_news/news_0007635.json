And the impact on some recipients with respect to increases in their Medicare payments will present some very real hardships.\nNowhere in the reports did I notice any mention that our elected officials in Washington and their extensive staffs will be subjected to the same constraints.\nThe hypocrisy of our elected officials defies one’s imagination. The messages they are sending to the younger generations — look after yourself first and to heck with everyone else — challenge the very framework of our society.\nOne media report by The Associated Press stated that the no COLA increase would affect more than one-fifth of the nation’s population. What that one-fifth of the population must do is exercise its civic duty, responsibility and obligation to vote in the upcoming elections, both this year, next year and for the foreseeable future.\nROBERT N. BAUGNIET\nSavannah\nA roadmap to failure\nI take exception to Tony Center’s letter to the editor on Oct. 15 (“Congress has an historic opportunity before them”) wherein he refers to an extreme right wing of Congress forcing the resignation of one speaker and, in effect, being uncompromising and “running roughshod” over those with different opinions.\nIn the first place, isn’t that what his party did when Obamacare was enacted, i.e., running roughshod over the Republicans and being totally uncompromising? How many Republicans voted for Obamacare? Likewise, wasn’t it his party and the president that used that “my way or the highway” tactic, which Mr. Center admits is not a strong principle of government and is a roadmap to failure?\nDidn’t the Dems also do the “my way or the highway” again when virtually all Senate Dems but three voted for the Iranian nuclear deal, a deal opposed by 80 percent of the American people, including those in the Dems’ home states?\nOthers make the claim that the Freedom Caucus and Tea Party are holding the other 240+ members of the Republican Congress hostage. No, they just refused to have a speaker run “roughshod” over them.\nHow? This same speaker refused to put his legislation proposals in front of Congress unless he and his committee personally approved them — that’s wrong. If they rebelled, he takes away their committee assignments and/or kicks them off of that committee entirely, as did Paul Ryan when a couple of Budget Committee members opposed his budget recommendations.\nThe Freedom Caucus and Tea Party stand for (in part) a smaller government, less spending, less taxes, more states’ rights and the appointment of judges that adhere to the Constitution — not those that legislate from the bench.\nI see nothing wrong with any of those principles, yet the Dems and any number of Republican Congressmen refer to those groups as extreme right wingers and/or Tea-baggers, as did our president.\nCome on, Tony Center, admit that it may be the other way around, that just maybe the rest of Congress is trying to hold the Tea Party and the Freedom Caucus hostage. And that’s a roadmap to failure as well.\nFRANK BENNETT\nSavannah\nThe Israeli-Palestinian problem requires a two state solution\nThere is considerable pro-Israel sentiment in Savannah. There is little pro-Palestinian sentiment.\nPlease let me spend a little time on the Palestinian side.\nFor more than 100 years, the Arab inhabitants of Palestine have been troubled by the influx of European Jews into Palestine. The Jews have believed they were returning to their ancient homeland, but the Palestinians have felt they were in the area much longer, and the Jews they found were Europeans, not people they would consider natives of the region.\nEthnically they were correct. The Jews were probably of mixed Slavic, Finnish and Turkic origins, not Semites at all. Why their homeland should be in Palestine, rather than in the lands of the old Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, remained a mystery to Palestinians.\nIt remains a mystery to me as well.\nBut that is history.\nToday the Palestinians, since 1967 under Israeli rule and misrule, have found their hope for a homeland of their own — a Palestine — undermined by every Israeli government that has eaten away at what was left of their homes and farms in the West Bank.\nAnd to add insult to injury, fanatical Zionists have begun to claim they want to rebuild the old Temple on Mt. Moriah, which the Muslims regard as their sacred religious space. As a result of Israeli policies and propaganda, the Palestinians are currently resorting to violence against Israel and Israelis.\nThose who support Israel for Zionist or Evangelical reasons think Israel is simply defending itself. But Palestinians also have a good case for their hopes and fears.\nI am no partisan of our president, whose qualifications for high office remain vaguely unknown, but at least he has tried to be fair to both sides of this conflict.\nThese sorts of conflicts seem without solution, but if the Irish Catholics and Protestants could finally after hundreds of years come to some sort of accommodation in Northern Ireland, fragile as it may be, perhaps the Israelis, once having elected a non-Fascistic government, and the Palestinians, having rejected terrorism, could also find some sort of solution.\nEveryone knows the solution is a two-state solution. Only extremists on both sides have prevented this from coming to pass.\nNORMAN RAVITCH\nSavannah", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-20T18:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T18:10:41.690+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
