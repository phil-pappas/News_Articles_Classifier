Actors Mark Rylance and Maxine Peake, as well as MPs David Davis and Andy Slaughter, and human rights lawyer Clive Stafford Smith have joined the Fast For Shaker campaign.\nMr Aamer, who was born in Saudi Arabia but has UK residency and whose wife and four children live in London, has been held in the prison for almost 14 years without trial.\nLast month, US authorities announced he will be freed, but he could not be released immediately because Congress has to be given 30 days' notice of his release.\nReports have emerged that the 46-year-old is on hunger strike protesting against alleged abuse at the military prison in Cuba.\nPlay video \"Last UK Gitmo Detainee To Be Freed\" Video: Last UK Gitmo Detainee To Be Freed Now supporters have launched Fast For Shaker to show solidarity with Mr Aamer by not eating for 24 hours.\nMr Aamer's family, who are planning to join the campaign, said: \"Thank you all so much for taking part in this fasting. We are touched.\n\"Our family we will be joining in the fasts with all of you. Let's all bring Shaker home.\"\nOrganisers said the initiative will start on Thursday and continue until Mr Aamer is released, with participants selecting a day to fast on.\nAndy Worthington, co-director of the We Stand With Shaker campaign, said: \"After the great news that Shaker Aamer is to be released from Guantanamo, we were all disturbed to discover that he is on a hunger strike, and wanted to show solidarity with him, and to encourage him to give up his hunger strike.\nPlay video \"Former Gitmo Detainee Speaks Out\" Video: Former Gitmo Detainee Speaks Out \"We very much hope that he will be released at the end of the 30-day period required by Congress before prisoners can be freed, but we will continue with the hunger strike if he is not.\n\"After nearly 14 years in US custody, treated brutally and never charged or tried, Shaker needs to be back with his family in London.\"\nMr Aamer said he was originally seized by bounty hunters while working as a charity worker in Afghanistan in 2001 shortly after the 9/11 attacks.\nHe was handed over to US forces and in February 2002 he was transferred to Guantanamo Bay and accused of aiding al Qaeda.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T14:54:31.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
