Kanye West swung by to audition for our judges and of course, he got a golden ticket!!!\" the TV show posted on Instagram.\nWest has said he is serious about running for U.S. president in 2020 and he performed at a Saturday Democratic Party fundraiser in San Francisco headlined by President Barack Obama, who gave him some tongue-in-cheek advice about a career in politics.\nBut his \"American Idol\" audition was widely seen as a publicity stunt for the TV show, which will air its 15th and final season in January after a dramatic decline in audiences.\n(Reporting By Jill Serjeant ; Editing by Doina Chiacu )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:03:57.791+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
