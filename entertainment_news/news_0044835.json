Photo: Transmission \nThe monthly expense reports he submitted to head office back in the US made for interesting reading too. \"I'd put in for one live sheep, to slaughter for Eid, 2000 rounds of ammunition, 50 rocket-propelled grenades,\" he says.\nAdvertisement He can laugh about it now – albeit grimly – but for years after he came home after almost seven years in the middle of the Iraq War he was a deeply disturbed man. \"As for so many soldiers,\" he says, \"the homecoming can be so much harder than the war itself.\"\nHe was angry. He drank too much. He was \"functionally dysfunctional\".\nUS Marines on patrol in Ramadi, 115 kilometers (70 miles) west of Baghdad, in 2006.

I just wanted the pain to stop, anything that would give me some pause from the demons that surrounded me constantly.\"\nFor years, he couldn't sleep, and even when he could it was no better. \"One night in Brooklyn I woke and heard somebody screaming blue murder, and suddenly realised it was me.\" While wrestling with his demons, he had torn his shoulder. \"For a period of time there, you had to be very careful how you woke me,\" he says.\nHe did the equivalent of seven tours of duty in Iraq – first as a print correspondent for Time , then as the man trying to help American audiences make sense of the war on television every night. He finally left in 2009, but only began to emerge from the darkness in 2012, when he penned a piece for Newsweek after two former colleagues were killed.\nIraqis detained by U.S. Marines in Ramadi, 2006. Photo: Yuri Kozyrev \nA month later, he wrote a piece on post traumatic stress disorder. \"It begins: 'I should be dead; I wish I was',\" he recalls. It was a major turning point, he says now. In writing it, he rediscovered his will to stay alive.\nWare is a stocky man of 46, with a nose that leans to the left, a legacy of his years playing hooker for Queensland's rugby side. His father was an organiser for the printers' union, and young Michael Ware first entered a newsroom at just six weeks of age when his old man took him in to Queensland Newspapers to show him off to his workmates.\nHe ran with a tough crowd in Keperra, but got a scholarship to Brisbane Grammar, and from there found his way to Queensland University to study law. A year working for Tony Fitzgerald (of Fitzgerald Inquiry fame) was enough to convince him to try something else, and the ink in his veins, perhaps inevitably, drew him to the Courier-Mail .\nMichael Ware reporting from Iraq. \nThese days the law degree \"only gets dusted off when I'm acting for one of my old mates\". It hasn't happened for a few years, he says, but it's not been an uncommon occurrence. \"I love hard men,\" he adds in a gravelly, conspiratorial whisper.\nWare reported from East Timor for the Courier-Mail , and Afghanistan for Time before heading to Iraq. In Afghanistan, he bought a second-hand video camera on the black market; over his near-seven years in Iraq, he used it to film reams and reams of footage as a form of note-taking.\n\"I was like a soldier with an M-16, popping in new cartridges,\" he says. \"A tape would finish, I'd pop it and load a new one almost without stopping.\"\nHe amassed boxes and boxes of tapes, which sat unlooked at under a bed in Brisbane for years. When he finally got around to revisiting the material, he knew he had some astonishing footage and the makings of a story. But which story?\nThe one he's told in Only the Dead – with the help of Oscar-winning documentarian Bill Guttentag as co-director and Ware's former editor at Newsweek (and now life partner) Justine Rosenthal as co-writer – is about the horrors of war and the very scary possibility that what drives us to those horrors is not external circumstances but something dark within each of us.\n\"It all goes back to Joseph Conrad and Heart of Darkness ,\" he says. \"I found my Kurtz.\"\nA firm believer in the edict that there are two sides to every story, Ware ran with the Americans and their Iraqi enemies, and as a result, his film features some of the most graphic footage of warfare ever seen (beheadings, the aftermath of suicide bombings, a night-time raid on a building in almost complete darkness). A seven-minute sequence in which an Iraqi insurgent is left to slowly die by a group of onlooking US soldiers is devastating in its lack of humanity, and for Ware perhaps the key moment in the film.\nSome of this footage might once have been considered the stuff of snuff movies, I suggest; did you wrestle with what to show and what not to?\n\"Absolutely,\" Ware says. \"I wrestled with that every day while I was reporting and I wrestled with it while we were making this film. Trust me, this is not the worst of it – not by a long shot.\"\nOnly the Dead screens at Cinema Nova from Thursday.
