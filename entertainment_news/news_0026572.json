I had never imagined that I will act with Rajini sir in my fourth film itself,\" she says, adding, \"No director will actually prefer to go for the same artists with whom they have already worked with in their previous film. In that way, Ranjith is different. About 90% of the Kabali cast comprises those who had worked with him in Madras.\"\nRiythvika has already begun to shoot for this film. \"The combination scenes of Rajini sir and me are being shot here in Chennai at the moment. For the first three days, I was afraid of doing anything in front of him, but then I got comfortable as he is a very down-to-earth person. After shooting for a scene, Rajini sir came to me and appreciated my performance. I still can't get over it. I became very emotional and will never forget that moment in my life,\" she says. \"I can't reveal details about my character now, but all I can say is that I have a makeover in the film and I won't look anything like my character in Madras.\"\nRiythvika is also awaiting the release of her next film, Oru Naal Koothu, which has Attakathi Dinesh in the lead. \"I play a role of an RJ in the film. Actor Karunakaran plays my brother. It's an interesting plot, as the film has three different stories within it,\" she says.\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-09-27T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:59:30.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
