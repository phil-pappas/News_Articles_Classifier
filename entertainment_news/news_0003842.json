BURKE FEELING BURNED BY FORMER EMPLOYEE\nPoaching salmon is one thing, but poaching employees is another.\nThe restaurant group run by David Burke is suing \"Top Chef Masters\" star Chris Shea for extracting three top chefs from Burke's camp when Shea left it earlier this year to become executive chef at the Wayfarer in Midtown, reports the Daily News' Barbara Ross.\nIn a lawsuit filed in Manhattan Supreme Court, the Burke Group is accusing Shea of \"blatantly and repeatedly\" violating his contract, in which he agreed not to solicit co-workers for 18 months after leaving the organization.\nHowever, \"almost immediately after resigning . . . (Shea) mounted an extensive poaching campaign in which he actively encouraged at least five Burke Group employees - and likely far more - to . . . join him,\" court papers say.\nThe lawsuit said Shea, who had been the executive chef at David Burke's Kitchen since 2011, used confidential knowledge of what employees were paid to offer higher salaries to those who jumped ship.\nThree \"highly skilled\" employees left \"en masse,\" causing \"substantial damage to the Burke Group\" by disrupting business and damaging morale, Burke's firm claims.\nThe lawsuit said Shea's old contract required him to pay Burke twice his salary as executive chef as a penalty for violating the pact. The Burke Group is also asking the court to bar Shea from hijacking any more of his former co-workers.\nShea didn't respond to requests for comment.\n'DEAD' STAR WANTS LIVING HISTORY\nSonequa Martin-Green , who plays the hard-edged Sasha Williams on AMC's \"The Walking Dead,\" tells the November issue of Good Housekeeping magazine she wants to play a historical figure next. \"I'd love to be in a biopic of someone who changed the landscape of America,\" says Martin-Green. \"There are so many people so I don't have to name them, but just one of them.
