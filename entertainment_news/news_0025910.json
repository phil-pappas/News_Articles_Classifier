Awards\nLos Angeles, CA (PRWEB) October 15, 2015\nConill’s ‘Mas Que Un Auto” brand loyalty campaign for Toyota was named “Integrated Marketing Campaign of the Year” during the Hispanic Public Relations Association (HPRA) National ¡Bravo! Awards last week in New York City. The campaign has garnered more than a dozen awards this year, including 2 coveted Cannes Lions, one Clio, and an Online Marketing Media & Advertising (OMMA) Award for Best Hispanic Marketing Campaign of 2015 as recent as last month.\n“The awards this campaign has received are a testament to the extraordinary team effort at all levels of the agency,” said Conill President Carlos Martinez. “As a longstanding business partner, we are proud to continue producing campaigns that build on Toyota’s success at reaching the Latino consumer in fresh and innovative ways.”\nThe “Mas Que Un Auto” campaign is a celebration of Latino loyalty -- not just for the brand, but for their cars. Backed by research that revealed a strong bond between Latinos and their Toyota’s, the campaign became a cultural movement to demonstrate how fun, engaging and rewarding it is to be part of the Toyota family.\nAt the core of the movement was http://www.masqueunauto.com , an online hub where consumers could express their individuality and loyalty by creating custom name badges for one of their trusted Toyotas. Once visitors entered their information, high-quality badges were produced and mailed to them at no cost. The hub also provided consumers an opportunity to share their stories via online and social media channels.\nABOUT THE HPRA NATIONAL ¡BRAVO! AWARDS\nThe HPRA National ¡Bravo!
