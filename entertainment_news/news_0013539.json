(Photo: Mary Hance / The Tennessean) Buy Photo \nShoppers line up behind a yellow line, eyeing the tables full of fresh merchandise as they eagerly await a store manager's \"go\" signal. \nAnd then the serious shopping commences as the throng of bargain hunters descends on the Goodwill Outlet's last-chance merchandise, which consists mostly of items that didn't sell in the regular Goodwill stores. \nIf I hadn't seen it for myself, I would have thought you couldn't give this stuff away. But I would have been dead wrong. \nThis is the most aggressive shopping I have ever seen — shoppers in protective gloves digging thoroughly from top to bottom, tossing unwanted items around and snatching things they think they might want or can sell. \nThe tables are filled with almost everything imaginable. The bin I watched being picked clean had a life jacket, numerous puzzle and Scrabble pieces, coat hangers, stuffed animals, Halloween decor, a top to a Crock-Pot and several dolls. \nIn one of the blue eight-foot rolling bins brought out throughout the day, there were baseball gloves, a portable toilet, golf balls, margarita glass, remote control, dolls, a cowboy hat, sets of venetian blinds and a baby bathtub. The Tennessean|Ms. Cheap \nYes, this is what I call adventure shopping. Now, the Goodwill Outlet is having its first \"blowout sale\" with tons (literally) of bargains on Thursday-Oct. 31. It’s outlet shopping with a much bigger selection of apparel and textiles. \nFor the uninitiated, the outlet, behind the Berry Hill Goodwill store, is where all Goodwill merchandise that has not sold in three weeks at the regular stores goes to be offered in this per-pound retail arrangement. The outlet also gets some donations that never even made it to the stores, depending on condition and supply. \nMost items are sold by the pound, and the shopping is by turns chaotic, messy, aggressive, competitive, strenuous and sometimes pushy. And for some of the shoppers, it's addictive. \nThis kind of shopping is definitely not for everyone. \nBut if you like to dig. And if you don't mind getting down and dirty. And if you like the thrill of the hunt. And if you are really, really cheap and don't mind elbowing your way into the frugal fray, this outlet could be right up your alley. \nGoodwill marketing and community relations director Karl Houston said the store will open an hour early — at 7 a.m. — and that the mix of merchandise will be much heavier on clothing and textiles. \nHe said the staff will roll out twice as much apparel merchandise as usual — including at least 20 of the big blue tables and 18 super-size boxes of clothing brimming with textiles — onto the 12,000-square-foot sales floor. The merchandise will be replenished throughout each day of the three-day sale. \nThe \"blowout\" sale is designed to introduce new shoppers to the unique concept of last chance, by-the-pound bargain shopping, as well as give the store's loyal regular diggers access to more — and better — clothing inventory for a few days and to move a lot of apparel merchandise. \nWhen I say the tables are big, I mean it. They are eight feet long and 18 inches deep. And Houston promises there will be some great inventory . \n\"A lot of it will be clothing that has not even been in the stores but will be sold by the pound anyway,\" Houston said. \"There will be a lot of fresh merchandise.\" \nThe idea behind the outlet is to recycle or salvage items that did not sell in the retail stores, minimizing the amount of refuse going into landfills and Goodwill's expenses in getting rid of unwanted items. The shoppers range from people on tight budgets looking for inexpensive ways to clothe their families to opportunists looking for a gem amid the mess. \nStory continues below photo \nYou would be surprised at how much usable, perfectly good stuff makes its way into the blue bins as last-chance options; there are happy finds for people with some creativity and the time and desire to dig in. \nI stood in line with a man who had snagged a new-looking pair of Banana Republic gloves that weighed in at 35 cents. \nI've talked to teachers who have found all kinds of good classroom props and aids at the outlet for pennies on the dollar. I've talked to eBay sellers who are always eager to find salable items, and to resourceful people who find all kinds of clothing and recreational items for their families or friends. And, of course, people who just love the hunt. \nSome shoppers are grabbing and hurling items into their carts willy-nilly, and frantically moving from table to table to dig for more loot as new tables are introduced. It is sort of like a giant rolling grab bag where you never know what you will see. \nGoodwill assistant store manger Tameka Robertson, who has worked for Goodwill for 18 years, says helping run the outlet store has been her favorite job. \n\"I love to see the smiles that come across so many people's faces. A lot of the ladies say this shopping is their therapy,\" she said. \nRobertson and store manager Deborah Craig said an average buggy filled with mixed merchandise averages $30-$40. They estimate as many as 75 percent of the outlet shoppers are re-sellers in search of items for stores, eBay, consignment or yard sales. Others, they say, are treasure hunters or shoppers truly in need of the bargain prices. \nHandbags are a big draw, with names such as Kate Spade, Gucci and Michael Kors buried in these tables from time to time. \n\"And if you are lucky, they are real,'' Craig said with a smile. \nThe treasure hunt mentality makes sense when you stories with a happy ending, such as one about a shopper who found a real Rolex watch in the pocket of a blazer, or another who found $200 in cash in an old purse. \nStory continues below photo Buy Photo \nWestern Kentucky University student Stephen Rosado is a regular picker at the Goodwill Outlet store, looking for items he can sell on eBay. (Photo: Mary Hance / The Tennessean) \nAnd then there was one lucky shopper who was said to have found a Bible that had $100 bills placed between the pages. \nYes, it is true that this kind of shopping is not for everyone, but the Blowout next week should be a slice of life, whether you buy anything or not. I promise that most of you have never seen shopping like this. This could make great reality TV. \nStay cheap, indeed! \nReach Ms. Cheap at 615-259-8282. Follow her at www.tennessean.com/mscheap , at https://www.facebook.com/mscheap?_rdr . and on Twitter @Ms_Cheap, and catch her every Thursday at 11 a.m. on WTVF-Channel 5's \"Talk of the Town.\" \nSo, what did Ms. Cheap buy? \nI was not as lucky (or aggressive) as some of the shoppers I met. I spent about an hour and all I bought was a small stuffed Minnie Mouse, a cute Berenstain Bear tin pail and a headband set of cat ears, which added up to 60 cents, including tax, at the 79 cent-per-pound rate. I went back for a follow-up look and bought lots of children’s books for a book drive, at 50 cents for hardbacks and 25 cents for paperbacks, and I found a cute Melissa and Doug white board-blackboard-magnet board that our grandbaby will love. I also got her a Mickey Mouse coloring book for a quarter. \nAbout the outlet \nThe Outlet at 780 Berry Road opened in March 2009 behind the Berry Hill Goodwill store. It moved there after Goodwill replaced the Ninth Avenue facility with the Lifsey Building. The original outlet site opened in the mid- to late-'90s. Call 615-346-1600. \nGoodwill Vice President of Retail David Jenkins said Goodwill is exploring the possibility of opening a second outlet.
