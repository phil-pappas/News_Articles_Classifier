He’d sold fruits and vegetables from area farmers while he was in high school. Reviving the stand was a way to give back.\nOffering pumpkins, squash and gourds, the stand raised more than $12,000 that fall, donating the proceeds to the Wilmot Cancer Center.\nIt was there that Bruce underwent chemotherapy in 2012, then again in 2013 when another more aggressive type of lymphoma appeared.\n“It’s a nice way to say thank you for taking such good care of me,” Bruce Bolger said.\nBolger, 60, is a Pittsford Sutherland graduate and the owner of Autoworks of Mendon. He says that getting to meet folks from the community who stop by and share a conversation with him is very rewarding.\n“People can buy pumpkins anywhere,” Bruce said. “but 100 percent of the money they spend here is going to support local cancer research and care for local cancer patients.”\nThis year, they’re raising money for the Pluta Cancer Center.\nThey’ve sold about 300 pumpkins already, with a similar number still available. Later this month, they’ll have acorn squash and butternut squash, and they’ll keep the stand open until their supply is sold out.\nThe stand is located at 191 S. Main St. in the village of Pittsford, and they’re also accepting donations through their facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/standagainstcancer14534\nSLAHMAN@Gannett.com", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/standagainstcancer14534"], "published": "2015-10-11T04:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:06:32.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
