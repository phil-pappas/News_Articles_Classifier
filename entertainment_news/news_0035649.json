At the Boston Book Festival Saturday , De Leon will be one of more than 175 authors to discuss their newest insightful and engaging works. Her story brings readers into the lives of a Guatemalan couple in Boston during the night of a fateful act and explores issues of identity and connection. “I have tried to show a different side to the narrative of what it is to be a Latino immigrant,” said De Leon, who will be interviewed by the moderator and answer questions from the public following a discussion of the story. “It’s complex, and sometimes people realize that the American dream doesn’t exist or suffice and they want to go home.” The inspiration for the story, which has been published, came from her parents, Guatemalan immigrants who worked as a painter of computer parts and a housekeeper and raised her first in Jamaica Plain and then Framingham. “My father has been homesick for 40 years,” said De Leon, who moved to Milton in 2014 with her husband and son, now 2. “He wants to go back to Guatemala so badly and my mother does not. I grew up in that environment of push and pull.” Along with immigration, just about every major contemporary concern will be a topic at the festival – ISIS, hackers, government surveillance, war and racial injustice. Among the 40 sessions, some look at life’s profound questions – how to die well, ask for help, find meaning, cope with loss. Others are light-hearted – the creation of cartoons and hit songs. “I very much want the festival to be relevant to people and to be a lot of fun,” said Executive Director Deborah Porter, who founded it in 2009. Outdoors on the Copley Square plaza, Berklee College of Music musicians perform and dozens of vendors exhibit. For the first time, the festival has six keynote addresses, giving each author the stage for an hour. “When we have the opportunity to enlist someone who is really big in the literary world, we like to give them their own space,” Porter said. “Our reputation has been good for some time, and I think people want to put us on their list of stops.” The kick-off keynote by novelist Margaret Atwood sold out a month ago, but five other keynotes are available on fiction, non-fiction, humanities, memoir, and art, design and architecture. They are National Book Award winner Column McCann, “Thirteen Ways of Looking,”; New Yorker staff writer and surgeon Atul Gawande, “In Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End”; Harvard professor James Wood, “The Nearest Thing to Life”; singer and songwriter Amanda Palmer “The Art of Asking,” and American Institute of Architects Gold Medal winner architect and urban designer Moshe Safdie. Other nationally-known authors participating in session panels include: General Stanley McChrystal, co-author of “In Team of Teams: New Rules of Engagement for a Complex World”; Pulitzer Prize science writer John Markoff, “Machines of Loving Grace”; local best-selling novelist B. A. Shapiro, “The Muralist”; critic Vivian Gornick, “The Odd Woman and the City”; Time magazine political columnist Joe Klein and New Yorker cartoon editor Bob Mankoff. For the first time, audiences can act as a jury in a mock trial. In “The Trial of Abraham,” legal scholar Alan Dershowitz will defend Abraham against attempted murder, biblical scholar Harvey Cox will prosecute, and First Circuit Court of Appeals Judge David Baron will preside. Another session will introduce three prize-winning Brazilian writers, accompanied by music from Brazilian bassist Flavio Lira. The works of Adriana Lisboa, Alexandre Vidal Porto, and Luisa Geisler are included in the first English version of an anthology of Brazilian writers. For children and teens, Louis Sacchar and Libba Bray will give keynote addresses, award-winning picture book authors and illustrators will read aloud, and authors will participate in Young Adult sessions. De Leon is particularly excited to hear Edwidge Danticat, one of her favorite writers, discuss her first young adult novel, “Untwine.” De Leon also is writing a young adult novel, “Volar,” in an office at the Boston Public Library, which named her its 2015-2016 Children’s Writer-in-Residence and awarded her a $20,000 stipend. She recently completed, and has an agent, for her first adult novel, “In the Country of Memory.” In the short term, De Leon is thrilled to meet more readers of her story, “Home Movie.” “The really touching thing is when people (of different backgrounds) say they feel like their experiences are validated and want to share their stories,” she said. “That’s the best complement I think a writer can get.” IF YOU GO WHAT: The Boston Book Festival WHEN: 10:45 a.m. - 5 p.m., Saturday, Oct. 24 WHERE: In and around Copley Square COST: Free, except $10 for the Amanda Palmer keynote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:56:28.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
