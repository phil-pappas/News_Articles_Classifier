We were all rooting for you! \n'America's Next Top Model' will end after cycle 22. And fans are not \"smizing.\" (Video via The CW ) \nTyra Banks tweeted this and fans, like Chrissy Teigen, are just as devastated as the model who has to chop off her long hair each season. The CW confirmed the show's cancellation shortly after. \nBut the show had an impressive 22 cycle stretch. And while some could argue the show has gotten weird, it did give us some unforgettable moments. \n\"Mmhmm,\" said Denzel. (Video via The CW ) \n\n'Top Model' also left us with a brand new vocabulary. Banks frequently said words like \"smize\" and \"ty-over\" and of course \"fierce.\" \nBanks is busy with her new talk show 'FABLife' so it makes sense that it's time to end the series. But it's still so hard to let it go.
