Accordingly the title track opens with the observation that Grant once thought ads for haemorrhoid cream could never be aimed at him.\nShare article Siouxsie And The Banshees drummer Budgie guests on a spoken word Bible reading about love while another collaborator of a similar vintage, Tracey Thorn, performs on Disappointing. It's one of several electro-funk workouts invoking the spirit of acts like Sylvester and Cameo. More familiar to fans of 2010's Queen Of Denmark are songs like Global Warming and Down Here, with their stately chord progressions and piano and string sections underpinning Grant's deep, honeyed voice. But as ever it's the lyrics which really thrill. “You and Hitler ought to get together/You ought to learn to knit and wear matching sweaters” is just one of dozens of quotable lines. A strong contender for album of the year.\nBarry Didcock", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-11T07:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T07:32:47.334+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
