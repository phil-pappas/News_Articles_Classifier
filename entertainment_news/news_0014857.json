By Prathamesh Jadhav on October 13, 2015 at 6:08 PM Comments \nKnown for her antics and loud mouth, ex Bigg Boss contestant Pooja Missra is showing her weird self to get back in the news. Frankly speaking, Pooja has no impressive CV to her credit. Neither is she doing any credible work. And now she is stooping to new levels to pull off stunts of this category to keep herself in the news. Or worse still she is desperate to enter the controversial show all over again by creating this image of a weird creature who could fetch more eyeballs (read: TRP’s) ALSO WATCH: Pooja Misrra fights with hotel staff, breaks a phone and slaps the manager: Watch video \nThis video shows Pooja slapping guys randomly. Apparently she entered the store in her drunken stupor and started abusing the owners. Using her biting tongue and (expectedly) filthy language Pooja then started accusing that the owner had stolen their credit card. She did not stop there. She even slapped a security guy and pulled a gun on him. This is not the first time Pooja has created hysteria for no reason. In the recent past the hungry-for-publicity gal shouted and hurled abuses at a hotel staff for reasons she only knew. And now history repeats itself only to ask an essential question–Has Pooja turned into a psychopath? Watch this video and tell us! \nModified Date: October 13, 2015 6:08 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T15:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:19:30.551+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
