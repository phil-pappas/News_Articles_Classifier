The Pass Cuisine: Contemporary American\nEntree price: ...\nImage 30 of 30 First look: State of Grace, River Oaks 1 / 30 Back to Gallery Ford Fry calls the area where he's planted his first Texas restaurant his \"old stomping grounds.\" The River Oaks neighborhood (he went to Lamar High School) is full of memories, even though he's long left Houston. And he's using those memories, especially of old-line Houston dining, as inspiration for State of Grace , the restaurant he's opening Monday, Oct. 19, at 3256 Westheimer.\nLongtime Houston residents might pick up on the references invested in the very personal opening menu he's created with executive chef Bobby Matos. And even if they don't recognize the nods to Hofbrau restaurant, Felix Mexican Restaurant and the old Armandos, diners will have to be impressed by the menu rich in culinary ties to the city and the Gulf.\nState of Grace, easily Houston's most anticipated restaurant of the season, is Fry's tenth project (the Atlanta-based chef/restaurateur has Marcel, Superica, St. Cecilia, King + Duke, The Optimist and Jct. Kitchen in Atlanta; No. 246 in Decatur, Ga.; St. Cecilia in Buckhead; and did the menu for Bar Margot at the Four Seasons Hotel Atlanta). It is probably his most stunning: a modern bistro with vintage touches including mounted deer antlers galore, plush textiles, a long marble bar and brass lamps. It's a handsome space (especially the round oyster bar called the Oyster Room) where Fry and Matos intend to delight diners with their upscale takes on familiar dishes.\n\"As a chef and a dreamer, I always had a passion to open a Texas-inspired restaurant,\" Fry said. \"I wanted it to feel Texas-proud and speak to the food of this region.\"\nHis own fondness for particular local foods are evident on the menu that includes a cheese enchilada \"a la Felix.\" \"It's a down-home cheddar enchilada with chili gravy and chopped onions,\" he said, although his luxe version is served in a copper dish.\nFrom his memories of Hofbrau restaurant he presents a bone-in strip steak bathed in butter. \"It was a place where they cooked T-bone steaks in butter with fried potatoes – soft and crispy, served in a pool of butter.\" He also remembers the restaurant's green salad studded with green olives and drenched in a garlic/lemon dressing. State of Grace's steak presentation will include fingerling potatoes braised in salt and butter then fried; it'll come with a salad reminiscent of Hofbrau.\nAnd from the original Armandos location he recalls a queso fundido with mushrooms. Here they'll broil a blend of cheeses and top it with roasted mushrooms, a dark chile sauce and serve it with flour tortillas made with bacon fat.\nIn a departure with crunchy bistro bread, the restaurant will have downy yeast rolls brushed with butter – another bit of nostalgia from the Fry childhood. \"We had a lake house on Lake Conroe and it was our routine to go Tinsley's Chicken where we'd eat fried chicken with yeast rolls and strawberry soda.\"\nThose dishes invested with Houston culinary heritage will play nice on the opening menu that includes Texas blue crab fingers, shrimp toast, deviled crab on the half shell, shrimp a la plancha with lime broth and sopping toast, hearth-grilled Spanish octopus, twice-fried hot chicken \"K-town style\" served with pickles, young kale Caesar salad with manchego and chorizo, and burrata with pistachio butter and toast.\nThose are just the starters. Pasta dishes include agnolotti with pear and pecorino; garganelli with pork and veal bolognese; tortellini stuffed with oxtail in a smoked chile broth; ricotta gnudi with caramelized cream, sage and chanterelles; and spaghetti alla chitarra with Gulf shrimp sugo.\nDinner entrees include shrimp-crusted flounder with field peas and bacon; Gulf cobia with rapini and tiny potatoes; scallops with crispy squid rice, root vegetables and curry leaf; roasted chicken with caper berries and potato puree; and pork schnitzel with brown butter. For those who like to share (dinner for two), the options are mesquite-roasted whole snapper with charred lemon and salsa verde; roast duck carnitas with mole; and a signature sticky smoked beef ribs with herb salad and warm roti.\nThe oyster bar will feature seafood towers, shrimp cocktail, razor clams with jalapeno lime vinaigrette, Alaskan king crab with lobster butter, half or whole lobster with lemon aioli, Gulf jumbo lump crab cocktail, and blue crab claws with parsley butter. The oyster selection includes bivalves from Virginia, Alabama, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Washington, and Canada.\nThere are six seats fronting what Fry calls \"the hearth,\" a wood fire stove that will provide a bit of smoky flavor to the dishes that come from it. All of Fry's restaurants employ an element of wood fire cooking, he said.\nWhile the menu has its share of upscale touches, Fry said he's just as excited by the house burger. The butter burger (double patty; made with house-ground beef with frozen butter blended in) comes with American cheese, caramelized onions, a slather of mayo and is skewered with a fried oyster. \"It's a fantastic burger,\" he said, adding it is served with bistro-style shoestring fries.\nFry praised Matos, who came to State of Grace from his post as executive chef of Ciao Bello. After the opening menu on which they collaborated, Fry said he's going to let Matos take over and make his own stamp. Who knows? Perhaps it'll come invested with Matos food memories too.\nDesserts are coming from pastry chef Chrysta Poulos who contributes to the nostalgic theme with sticky toffee pudding, Texas pecan ball sundae, lemon hand pie with mascarpone-bourbon ice cream, spiced apple layer cake with cream cheese frosting, and flourless chocolate truffle tart.\nThe beverage program, created by Lara Creasy, offers classic cocktails high on Texas brands and local flavor components, and a wine list heavy on big cabernets, Italian wines, and great whites perfect for oyster bar offerings.\nState of Grace will be open for lunch from 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through Friday; happy hour from 3 to 5 p.m. daily; and dinner from 5 to 10 p.m. Sunday through Thursday, and until 11 p.m. on Friday and Saturday.
