And Monday night, during the show's battle rounds, Levine had their back, opting to keep the twins on his team following a duet performance of The Calling's \"Wherever You Will Go\" against another one of his competitors, Chance Peña. \n\"Andi and Alex have the most ethereal brilliance to their performance style,\" Levine said after the performance. \"That's why I had to go with them.\" \nDon't feel bad for Peña though, who was stolen by Shelton after Levine eliminated him from his team. Although Shelton too had glowing words for Andi & Alex. \"That was magical,\" he said. \"There's something about sibling harmony that's like nothing else.\" \n\"Andi and Alex, what you do when you sing is nothing short of magic,\" Williams echoed. And Stefani added, \"The harmonies are candy in my ear.\" \nThe twins will next perform on \"The Voice\" during the knockout rounds. A date has yet to be announced. \nYou can watch their Monday night battle with Peña below, and below that, their blind audition. \nFind out about the week's must-see shows, concert tickets and more in the newsletter \"Piet Levy's Music Picks.\" Subscribe at jsonline.com/newsletters. \nPiet talks about concerts, local music and more on \"TAP'd In\" with Jordan Lee, 8 a.m. Thursdays on WYMS-FM (88.9). © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc.
