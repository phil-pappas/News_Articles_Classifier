As the show's musical guest, the actress performed her debut single \"Love Myself\" which has become an anthem for women empowerment. \"Tonight I was the musical guest on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon,\" she wrote on Instagram. \"My first time on the show I was 14 years old and never thought I'd be back to perform my first single. Love you long time Jimmy! Thanks for having me. :) PS I met the legendary Lady GaGa and am so inspired by her words of wisdom.\" Steinfeld signed to Republic Records in May and released both the single and the music video for \"Love Myself\" in August. The \" True Grit \" star's debut album is expected to be released early next year. \" 'Love Myself' was written by Julia Michaels and Justin Tranter, and they're not only two of my favorite writers, but two of my favorite people that I've had the pleasure of working with on the whole album,\" Steinfeld described her single to Radio.com. \"There was no question, to me, that that should be the first single. There was something so powerful about the lyrics that made me feel so good about life, and about myself, and the idea of putting something so powerful and empowering into the world meant a lot to me.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T05:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:55:21.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
