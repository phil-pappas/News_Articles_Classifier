Photo: Hilary Walker \n  It's a shame Patti Smith left Australia off the schedule when planning her Horses 40th anniversary tour, but then again, it would have meant that the pearl of this year's Melbourne Festival program, a tribute concert performed by Jen Cloher, Courtney Barnett, Adalita Srsen and Gareth Liddiard, never would have happened.\nSo appealing was the idea of four of our finest musicians interpreting Smith's landmark proto-punk debut, organisers had to add a second matinee show to next Sunday's performance at Melbourne Town Hall.\nIt was Cloher who came up with the idea after attending a tribute to the Beatles' White Album at Hamer Hall last year, performed by Tim Rogers, Chris Cheney, Phil Jamieson and Josh Pyke.\nCourtney Barnett (left) and Jen Cloher say performers need to be challenged.. Photo: Lisa Sorgini \n\"It was packed to the rafters, I was like, 'wow', but I also thought it would be so good to do an album by a woman,\" says Cloher.\nAdvertisement \"And when you think about iconic rock 'n' roll albums by women, there are iconic albums out there but I think Horses is considered one of the great rock 'n' roll albums.\"\nBoth Cloher and Barnett admit to feeling a little nervous about taking on Horses , and not just because it's such a canonical work.\nThe songs are exceptionally wordy, drawing from influences such as the 19th-century French poet Arthur Rimbaud, and some tracks, such as nine-minute opus Birdland , were improvised, the delivery veering between song and spoken-word poetry.\n\"There's a high possibility of failure, there's a lot of risk,\" says Cloher.\n\"It's not an easy album, you have to have performers who are willing to go somewhere. If you had any kind of hang-ups or didn't want to seem uncool then I'd say Horses is not the album for you, it's got that kind of transcendental, shamanic quality about it ... and when you watch someone like Gareth Liddiard you can see that he's more than willing to go to that place.\"\nBarnett wasn't so willing to go to that place until recently. She recalls considering covering Horses for the Summer of Classic Albums series hosted by St Kilda's Pure Pop Records last year. After a closer look at Smith's lyrics, she chose INXS' Kick instead.\nThat Barnett, Cloher, Srsen and Liddiard only have to perform two songs each makes it an easier proposition.\nPlus, Barnett and Cloher say the fear is motivating.\n\"I think as a performer, if you don't challenge yourself in that regard you don't grow,\" says Barnett.\n\"I want to grow as a performer, as a songwriter, as a musician. So it's a step which could go either way but I think it's strengthening.\"\nCloher agrees: \"I thought, if I can pull this off, if I can get out there and really serve the song, then what an achievement, and also I think that will be such an exciting, exhilarating experience for an audience.\n\"I also think that's why that album is so famous and why Patti is so famous within that world of rock 'n' and roll, because she does invest her entire being when she's on stage performing, she doesn't hold anything back.\"\nPatti Smith's Horses is at the Melbourne Town Hall next Sunday October 18 at 8pm (sold out) and 5pm. www.festival.melbourne", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:51:49.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
