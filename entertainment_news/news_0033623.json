The impressionistic story of an 11-year-old West African boy’s experience as a child soldier, told in time-jumping flashbacks and young Agu’s unique, innocent yet poetically comprehending voice, has shattered sensibilities and touched hearts for a decade.\nOne of the book’s early fans, Cary Fukunaga, had been writing a movie about child soldiers at the time a friend gave him a copy of the novel. Fukunaga had a few short films under his belt and some professional cinematography experience when he carried the book to a meeting with some Hollywood executives. Impressed by the filmmaker, who would go on to direct the harrowing, mostly Mexico-shot child immigrant drama “Sin Nombre” and create the first, acclaimed season of “True Detective,” the producers optioned “Beasts” for Fukunaga to adapt.\nThose and other projects delayed bringing Iweala’s novel to the screen for a number of years, but Fukunaga has finally directed the film with newcomer Abraham Attah as Agu and British actor Idris Elba as the monstrous rebel commandant, who is both an inspiring father figure and an unconscionable exploiter of his child fighters. It will open in Landmark Theatres and be the first original feature available on Netflix worldwide today.\n“I got a chance to see the film before it came out and I was moved to tears,” says Iweala, the Washington, D.C., born and raised son of a Nigerian doctor, who wrote “Beasts” as his Harvard senior thesis. “I felt he really knew what he was doing, really knew story, and not just that, but he was telling the kinds of stories that I wanted to tell.”\nIweala initially met Fukunaga when the Bay Area native was in the process of making “Sin Nombre.” The two remained in contact over the years of developing the film project, but Fukunaga took the script in his own direction. He made the narrative linear instead of a free-association memory piece, added family members to Agu’s happy prewar life and limited the boy’s patois voice-over. Still, Agu’s terror, learning to kill and increasingly difficult efforts to cling to a soul remained the story’s core.\nMore than 1,000 kids were looked at in Ghana before the amateur Attah, the son of a roadside water saleswoman, was cast as Agu.\n“Abraham really did what needed to be done, and it’s amazing to think that a young talent just made it work and stole the show,” Iweala says of Attah, who won the Venice Film Festival’s Marcello Mastroianni Award for an emerging actor last month. “The combination of raw talent and the amount of preparation he had to do to play that and never having acted before, to me, says a lot.”\nAdvertisement\nVeteran Elba (TV’s “The Wire,” “Luther” and more; Heimdall in the Marvel movies, Nelson Mandela in “Long Walk to Freedom”) seemed like perfect casting for the charismatic megalomaniac called Commandant. And he is.\n“I remember telling my mom after I saw the movie for the first time that they couldn’t have picked actors that better represented what I had seen in my head,” Iweala reveals. “Watching Idris playing that role, I thought ‘You’re better at this and I’m a little scared!’”\nElba’s mother comes from Ghana and his father from Sierra Leone, one of the nearby nations that suffered horrendous civil wars in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. As its title suggests, the book was not set in a named country. Fukunaga felt it was imperative to film in West Africa as Iweala described it, though, despite financiers’ pressures to shoot in more movie-experienced countries like South Africa and Kenya on the eastern side of the continent.\nGhana was the only West African nation insurers would agree to, so despite its lack of a filmmaking infrastructure the production went there. Fukunaga immediately faced hurdles he’d expected and a number he had not.\n“We worked with so many incredible people who were from Ghana. People who are very gentle, hard-working, well-intentioned and so polite, everyone will say yes to you,” the director begins. “The reality is, they can’t always give you what you’re asking for. So we ran into these sort of traps where we thought something was happening that wasn’t actually at all. You had to start to micro-observe or -manage every step of the process to make sure you were getting what you need.”\nAdd to that catching malaria; Fukunaga shrugs off the week in bed as good time to concentrate on tweaking the script. He also went to Ghana intending be the film’s cinematographer, not its camera operator — which he became after the Steadicam guy pulled his hamstring on the first day of shooting.\n“It was an extra bit of manual labor I wasn’t expecting,” the filmmaker deadpans. “I lost about 20 pounds on the shoot.”\nFukunaga isn’t suggesting he suffered anything resembling that of those caught in a guerrilla war. And while he did a good job of capturing beautiful images in the jungles and towns of Ghana, “Beasts” is uncompromisingly rife with disturbing events. It’s not the kind of thing some will find entertaining, but thanks to the Netflix deal, those who may not want to buy a movie ticket for the pleasure can catch this important film via their subscription.\n“While there is high pressure to have it put in theaters, more than anything I want people to see it. Netflix is putting a lot of power behind getting their first original film out,” Fukunaga says of the reported $12 million Netflix offer. “Ultimately, there’s a freight train behind that thing; they’re pushing hard to make sure people watch the film.”\nAbout the Author Reach the author at bob.strauss@dailynews.com or follow Bob on Twitter: @bscritic .\nFull bio and more articles by Bob Strauss Back to top", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/bscritic", "http://mn1-laweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/persbilde?Avis=LA&ID=22"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:00:07.806+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
