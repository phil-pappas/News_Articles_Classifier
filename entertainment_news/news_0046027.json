The Hawks have claimed four points with their latest triumph coming Saturday in a 1-0 overtime victory over the Lightning. Here are some notes from the game:\nGarbutt comes through\nRyan Garbutt, whom the Hawks acquired in the Patrick Sharp trade this offseason, had perhaps his best game in a Hawks uniform this season. Garbutt, skating with Vincent Hinostroza and Teuvo Teravainen, logged six shots on net with some of those chances coming on the penalty kill. Garbutt logged 1 minute, 32 seconds of ice time on the penalty kill for the Hawks.\n“He had much more speed, puck possession today,” coach Joel Quenneville said. “That line was a factor as the game progressed.”\nGarbutt was a plus-12 in Corsi – tops among the Hawks – and generated three high danger scoring chances.\nToews gets on the board\nMore than 24 periods had gone by this season and Jonathan Toews still had not scored a goal for the Blackhawks. But he made his first one count, scoring just 17 seconds into a 3-on-3 overtime to give the Hawks the victory. Toews stuffed his own rebound past Lightning goaltender Kristers Gudlevskis as the Hawks advanced to 2-0 in games that went to overtime this season.\n“I was just hoping something would go in,” Toews said. “I think there was going to be a bounce like that at some point. As games go along here at this point – I guess we’re eight games in now – really trying to get on the board just to try and feel like you can play the game and not worry about scoring and when it’s going to come.”\nIt finally came Saturday.\nBlankety blank\nWith the win, the Hawks became just the third team in NHL history to blank a team in the clinching game of the Stanley Cup Final and the teams’ first meeting the next season. The Hawks have developed a knack for shutting down one of the most high-powered offenses in the NHL, no small feat Saturday without Keith around.\n“Our series was close, both teams have respect for the other’s offense,” Quenneville said. “Every shift is critical. You want to make sure that every shift is critical. Make sure you’re positionally aware, try to deny the rush game as best you can and keep the puck as long as you can.”\nchine@tribpub.com\nTwitter @ChristopherHine\nPrivacy Policy Ice Hockey Chicago Blackhawks Ryan Garbutt Jonathan Toews Duncan Keith Tampa Bay Lightning Joel Quenneville", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562c6f58/turbine/ct-blackhawks-lightning-notes-hockey-spt-20151024"], "published": "2015-10-25T13:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T13:55:02.874+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
