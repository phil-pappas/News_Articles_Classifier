It is a Britney Spears town.”\nHe made the comments on his Facebook page earlier this week, but removed them Wednesday. A press release was in the works, he said Thursday.\nHis last performance of “Sinatra: The Man, The Music” at the Palazzo will be November 28.\nIt opened in January and will be closing about two weeks before what would have been Sinatra’s 100 th birthday, Dec. 12.\nReached by telephone on Thursday, Anderson suggested he was blindsided by the move. “It’s a drag they did it two weeks before Frank’s birthday,” he said.\nHis Facebook post:\n“I just wanted to tell everyone that the decision to leave the Venetian/Palazzo was mine. I only wanted to play here for one year. I fell two weeks short. The hotel needs to do some work on the room for the next show that is coming in.\n“This show my friends has to go to where Frank Sinatra fans are living. They do not come to LV any more. This is no longer a Sinatra, Darin, Bennett, Mathis or Tom Jones town. It is a Britney Spears town.\n“For me....it is a launching pad to the rest of the world and that is where I am taking this show. All over the world, but first.... all over America.\n“I have already had offers for Broadway with this show. I am simply taking off the month of (December) to be with my family.\n“You will soon be reading about where Frank the man the music starring Bob Anderson will be opening in the Spring. \nI still have two months to perform at the Venetian/Palazzo and I am going to enjoy every single show.\n“I can't even begin to tell you all what a thrill it is to sing in front of those brilliant musicians. They are the best and that is why 2 thirds of them played with Sinatra. My Musical Director is Vince Falcone who performed that same role with Frank Sinatra. It doesn't come any better than what it is. \n\"Someone asked me why don't I take the show down to a sextet and get a smaller room and keep the show in Las Vegas. Been there....Done that! \n\"When you see me in your hometown....please come up and say hello. I will be doing some postings from the show soon. I love you all.”\nContact Norm Clarke at nclarke@reviewjournal.com . Find him on Twitter: @Norm_Clarke \nWynonna ready to stay cool...
