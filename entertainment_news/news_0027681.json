Anton and Katie (Guy Levy/BBC) \nSpeaking to Woman magazine, Craig said: “Katie is fantastic – but Anton’s got a problem, because he just isn’t giving her the right material and he’s wasting an opportunity. \n“The pro dancers aren’t invincible, but sometimes they think they are. Anton’s not used to being criticised, and he was rather deflated when we told him off for his cha-cha-cha routine.” Strictly Come Dancing judges Len Goodman, Darcey Bussell, Craig Revel Horwood, Bruno Tonioli (Ray Burmiston/BBC) \nThe cha-cha-cha routine was the couple’s lowest-scoring, with just 20 points. But at the weekend they beat favourites including Peter Andre, Helen George and Jay McGuinness to score 33 points. \nTheir dance was praised by the judges for being “gracious and sophisticated”, while Craig said they were “fantastic”.

He needs to rise to the occasion and get a different game plan.” Share article \nStrictly Come Dancing continues on Saturday October 24 at 6.35pm on BBC One.
