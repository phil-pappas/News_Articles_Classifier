The challenge was the heat – for us from Europe it’s difficult to handle the hot conditions.”Schurter clinched the gold in one hour, 20 minutes and 36 seconds, just ahead of France’s Maxime Marotte and Italy’s Andrea Tiberi.

I was very involved in the London Games, which were excellent, and I thought it would be very difficult for upcoming organisers to do better. But after seeing this (the Rio course), it will be way better than London, so congratulations.” \n  9:10 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:51:21.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
