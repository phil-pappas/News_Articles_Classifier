That was TV Hangover co-host Vicki Hyman reacting to news of a \"Gilmore Girls\" revival by Netflix that may give Lorelai and Luke (and the rest of us) the closure that has been sadly wanting since the show went off the air in 2007. While co-host Erin Medley was never a fan of jabbering caffeine addicts (Vicki aside), both hosts offer suggestions for beloved shows that never got the send-off it deserved. (What's your pick? Let us know below in the comments.)\nAlso in this episode of TV Hangover: Erin and Vicki, in benevolent moods, duck back into a few new shows they've earlier dismissed, including \"Dr. Ken,\" \"Best Time Ever,\" and \"Scream Queens\" and see if they've hit their stride or continued to stumble, and they also give a brutal assessment to the new ABC crime anthology \"Wicked City,\" which premieres Tuesday night.\nIn our news segment, we talk about Tracy Morgan's triumphant \"Saturday Night Live\" return , the cancellation of \"America's Next Top Model\" after 22 seasons, er, cycles, and predict which new show will be the first on the chopping block. ( \"Minority Report\" ? \"Blood and Oil\" ? Or will it be the brand new but extremely ratings deficient \"Truth Be Told\" ?)\nMORE: Why 'Quantico' is this season's best show â€” or best pilot, at least", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:13:02.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
