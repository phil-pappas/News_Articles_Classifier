Fancy reliving all its best moments again and again? Now you can with this intergalactic collection of GIFs. 1. The Millennium Falcon makes the jump to hyperspace Can it still make the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs? Sure looks like it. 2. Kylo Ren on the bridge of the Star Destroyer Finalizer We have a Darth Vader fanatic in our midst. \"Nothing will stand in our way. I will finish what you started,\" says a sinister Kylo Ren, in what almost looks like a fancy penthouse apartment. 3. Finn's TIE Fighter gets shot down over Jakku Shot down? Collision with debris? We're not sure why Finn's TIE Fighter falls out of space and ends up on Jakku, but we're guessing he wasn't texting at the wheel. 4. Kylo Ren tortures Poe Dameron The first time we've spotted these two together on screen, and Kylo Ren's act of torture suggest that there's a lot more to Poe Dameron than just an X-wing pilot. 5. The Resistance ambush The First Order on an ice planet Is this Hoth? And might this epic dog fight be a scene from the finale, aping the Death Star run from the original Star Wars ? One thing's for sure, it looks exquisite. 6. Han and Leia reunited \"I love you.\"\"I know.\" 7. Squad goals.. with Kylo Ren Quite possibly the coolest moment in the trailer. Kylo Ren assembles his First Order goons amid a violent storm. 8. Finn, Chewie and Han throw their hands in the air Unless they're enjoying an aerobics class, our trio of heroes are being captured. But where and by whom? Speculation has been running rampant about Han's fate in The Force Awakens - he may not make it out alive . 9. Kylo Ren faces down a terrified Finn John Boyega's Finn doesn't look particularly comfortable with a lightsaber in hand, we're guessing he'll need a little hand from someone else to win this duel (where are you Luke Skywalker?). Of note: Kylo Ren isn't wearing his helmet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T16:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:38:53.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
