Morton Photography and Oto Godfrey \nA modified DeLorean was the means of time travel in the \"Back to the Future\" movies. \nMichael J. Fox, as Marty McFly, rides a hoverboard in 1989's Back to the Future II. \nGreat scott! \nIt’s almost Oct. 21, 2015, the day Marty McFly and Doc Brown time traveled to in \"Back to the Future's\" 1989 sequel. \nTwo local men, Taylor Merrill and Jimmy Cosentino, are celebrating the film with an event at the Brickyard Restaurant and Sports Bar , located at 415 N.

The night will include all things BTTF and trivia. \nMerrill and Cosentino met as children at Manheim Township Middle School and bonded over their love for the film. \n“We’ve both been huge 'Back to the Future' fans since the movies came out when we were young,\" Merrill says. \"He was like the only other person I know that’s as passionate about it as I am.” \nWhen the Oct. 21 date began to draw near, Merrill pitched the idea of throwing a party in the film's honor to Cosentino, who was \"gung ho\" about it, Merrill says. \nThe event, which begins at 6:30 p.m., will feature a screening of the film, movie trivia by Greg Carey and memorabilia on display. \nMerrill says Cosentino's job as a professional prop maker has helped him gather \"Back to the Future\" goodies like hoverboards, Marty McFly's light-up shoes and the sports almanac. \n“I remember in middle school there was a rumor going around that hoverboards were actually coming out,\" Merrill says. He got a paper route to save money, and was \"heartbroken\" when he found out it was just a rumor. (He kept the paper route until senior year of high school, though.) \nSome of the predictions about the future (Google glass and hoverboards) have almost come true. \nOthers, no so much. Well, the Chicago Cubs aren’t out of the running for a championship yet. \nLocally, you can watch a triple feature of Back to the Future movies at Regal Cinemas Manor 16 and Penn Cinema Wednesday. \nPuffy vests and DeLoreans are optional. \nIf Marty McFly's hoverboard from Back to the Future II is close to reality, can Luke Skywalk… Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:01:34.822+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
