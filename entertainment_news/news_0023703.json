Tilly returns home to find her mum a mentally unhinged recluse who claims she doesn't even have a daughter. \nDavis nearly outshines Winslet in the role, which sees her go through a transformation as dramatic as her daughter during the course of the two-hour film. \nWinslet leads a very talented Aussie cast, which also includes Hugo Weaving, Sarah Snook, Rebecca Gibney, Shane Jacobson, Gyton Grantley and Sacha Horler.

Ben King \nHer Aussie accent is spot-on, a commendable feat for any overseas import. \nThe film is based on Rosalie Ham's bestselling novel, a bittersweet comedy-drama which I'm now keen to read after seeing the film. \nTilly was sent away to boarding school after she was accused of murdering a classmate. \nAt first it seems strange that Tilly can't remember the incident, which is slowly revealed through a series of flashbacks. \nHer arrival in Dungatar, the location of which is never mentioned but you soon learn is deep in AFL territory, is met with horror from many of the residents, except for flamboyant local copper Sergeant Farrat (Weaving). \nHer journey of redemption and self-discovery is an entertaining one and it's easy to forgive her romance, which feels a bit hasty, with strapping lad Teddy (Luke Hemsworth). Winslet and Hemsworth's age difference isn't even that noticeable. \nWhile PJ Hogan (Muriel's Wedding) doesn't direct the film (his wife Jocelyn Moorhouse does), he is one of its writers and leaves a strong fingerprint. \nIn a way, The Dressmaker reminds me of Hogan's most recent Aussie film Mental with its heightened sense of reality. \nThe supporting characters are totally over the top and fill their roles to melodramatic extremes.

Ben King \nYou could argue Dungatar itself is the film's villain, as the combined eccentricities and grudges of its residents come back to bite them. \nBut, like in Mental, the central characters - Winslet as Tilly, Davis as Mad Molly and Hemsworth as Teddy - provide the film all the heart it needs. \nAs Moorhouse says in the film's production notes: \"It's the kind of home town you never want to go back to, full of nasty people and really frightening secrets. \n\"Everybody knows something about everybody else and everyone is held in check.\" \nThe Dressmaker's director of photography, Oscar-nominee Don McAlpine, also deserves special mention. \nThe film's imagery is nothing short of stunning as bright, haute- couture gowns stand out like glistening jewels against the dry, harsh surrounds of rural Australia. \nOf course, some of the credit must also go to the combined efforts of costume designers Marion Boyce and Margot Wilson. \nTheir dazzling dresses are sure to make any cinema-goer yearn for the classic glamour of the 1950s. \nThe Dressmaker is bright, quirky and has a huge heart. \nIt has the potential to be a hit overseas as well as domestically and for the sake of its talented cast and crew, I hope that will be the case. I'd happily watch more films like this. kate winslet", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:08:46.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
