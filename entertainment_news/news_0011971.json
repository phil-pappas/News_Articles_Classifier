Australia, this'll go right over your head.\nAn online petition, launched by Australian citizen Thomas Probst, has garnered a whopping 16,603 signatures (as of writing) for his modest proposal to change the Australian Dollar to Australian Dollarydoos.\nThe phrase, first uttered by the unnamed Australian sheepfarmer in The Simpsons, has since become a popular reference for fans of the long-running show. As Probst describes it, it's simple economics.\n\"Due to global commodity prices plummeting, the Australian economy is struggling. That's why we need something to stimulate the Australian economy and that something is changing the name of the Australian currency to 'Dollarydoos'. This will make millions of people around the world want to get their hands on some Australian currency due to the real life Simpsons reference, driving up the value of the Australian currency.\"\nIn fairness to him, it's a pretty logical idea. We'd buy some Dollarydoos purely to see what they look like printed. As it stands, the petition has yet to receive any support from Australian political parties, however Nine Australia have contacted the Australian Treasurer, Scott Morrison, for comment on the matter.\nVia Change.org\nMORE: Watch: This shark found off US coast is SO BIG it scared the bejaysis out of Aussie TV presenters\nMORE: 11,000 people (and counting) want to swap Katie Hopkins for 50,000 refugees\nMORE: Spain is planning a tax for sunshine.
