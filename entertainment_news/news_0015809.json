Then came the Islamic State, or ISIS, a fanatical Sunni Muslim mob whose mass rape, pillaging, torture and beheadings in the name of Islam made al-Qaeda almost seem moderate by comparison.\nSuch is the nature of fanatical religious movements. Suicidal acts, designed to demonstrate unflinching devotion to God, ultimately become a kind of one-upmanship competition for bragging rights in heaven: “You only blew up a Humvee? Well, I beheaded five Yazidis then took out an entire convoy with my explosive suicide vest.”\nEven the radical leaders of al-Qaeda saw something dangerous and uncontrollable in Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a tattooed Jordanian street thug who got his jihadi conversion in the late 1980s after joining the mujahideen’s fight against Soviet occupation forces in Afghanistan.\nWashington Post reporter Joby Warrick documents Zarqawi’s trajectory in his new book, Black Flags: The Rise of ISIS , from his leadership of a tiny, isolated group of religious fanatics to what became a meandering ministate with its own oil reserves, refineries and well-equipped military. Zarqawi was the one who articulated the vision of the borderless Islamic caliphate that the Islamic State now claims.\nZarqawi was a radical’s radical, so extreme that even Osama bin Laden kept him at arm’s length. Bin Laden tried to sideline Zarqawi in 2002 by keeping him isolated in Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. But that move wound up, instead, empowering Zarqawi when the U.S. invaded the following year.\nHe masterminded the roadside bombings and suicide attacks that devastated U.S. military forces in Iraq and won an endorsement by bin Laden, who named Zarqawi the “prince of al-Qaeda in Iraq.” But Zarqawi also sought to foment chaos and civil war by exploding bombs at Shiite markets and mosques. He also wanted to take his fight to Jordan, where he authorized a U.S. diplomat’s assassination and a suicide bomb attack on a wedding party at an Amman hotel.\nHis grand vision was to immerse the Arab world in such chaos, making it ungovernable and forcing a humiliating U.S. withdrawal. Without Western-style democracy getting in the way, the fertile ground would be set for the Islamic caliphate to take hold.\nAl-Qaeda disavowed Zarqawi’s tactics. He was too radical even for them.\nBlack Flags is a detailed, step-by-step narrative demonstrating how repeated miscalculations by the United States, Arab leaders and al-Qaeda wound up empowering the Islamic State.\nWarrick lets witnesses tell the story. They include an Islamist radical who was imprisoned with Zarqawi in Jordan in the 1990s; a CIA agent who tracked Zarqawi’s entire terrorist career; victims of his bombing campaigns; and a frustrated Jordanian intelligence agent who saw where this was heading but couldn’t get anyone to listen to him. Warrick even details the exasperation of Jordan’s King Abdullah as he also sought to take Zarqawi down.\nHow did Zarqawi get so far? His first big move was to infiltrate his radical followers into Sunni-dominated Anbar Province in Iraq, where he proceeded to unleash a deadly wave of car-bomb and suicide attacks against U.S. targets. Casualties skyrocketed, which helped immensely in his Internet recruiting campaign.\nU.S. special operations forces killed him on June 7, 2006. But by then, he had so thoroughly radicalized a new generation of jihadis that his movement was assured survival. The corrupt and oppressive Shiite-led government that remained in Iraq after America’s 2011 withdrawal helped drive more Sunnis into Zarqawi’s camp.\nThe Arab Spring revolts brought yet a new, unexpected twist. A movement to oust the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad in neighboring Syria opened the door for Zarqawi’s followers to establish a beachhead. Amid the chaos, the Islamic State declared the caliphate envisioned years before by Zarqawi. It now includes a vast swath of Syria and Iraq.\nWhat we’re witnessing today is nothing short of a horror story. But so absorbed are we in the daily spectacles of beheadings, rapes and refugee crises across the Middle East and Europe, few of us have stopped to look at where this all began.\nBlack Flags provides answers in this still-unfolding history of what happens when religious radicals try to outdo one another for the mantle of God’s favorite.\nTod Robberson is a Dallas Morning News editorial writer.\nBlack Flags: The Rise of ISIS Joby Warrick (Doubleday, $28.95) Available Tuesday", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T05:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:55:15.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
