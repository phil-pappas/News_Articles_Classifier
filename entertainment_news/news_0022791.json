Comments \nRobbin Thompson, a former Bruce Springsteen bandmate and co-writer of the official Virginia state song, died early Saturday morning after a battle with cancer. He was 66. \nThompson's musical career spans more than 40 years, but the Richmond, Va. resident slowed down his touring in recent years. He said on his website that his concert schedule was limited to shows he knows \"will be enjoyable.\" \nIn September, Thompson took to his Facebook page to publicly announce his long battle with cancer. \n\"I apologize for being out of touch for a while,\" he wrote. \"Many of you know that I've been battling cancer for over 15 years. These days, it's causing a few problems but I'm dealing with it and will be back performing soon. Like real soon. ...\" \nThompson joined Springsteen's pre-E Street band, Steel Mill, as lead singer in 1971.

In 1969, Child morphed into Steel Mill, and in 1970, Steven Van Zandt replaced Roslin on bass and Thompson was added as a fifth member. \nSteel Mill never officially released an album; they recorded a three-song demo for legendary concert promoter Bill Graham, but rejected a recording contract that Graham offered. \nIn 2004, Lopez reinvented Steel Mill as Steel Mill Retro , but Thompson wasn't included in that rendition of the band. \nThompson and friend Steve Bassett collaborated in 1978 to create the song, \"Sweet Virginia Breeze.\" It was later adopted as the official \"popular\" state song in the Old Dominion state. \nThompson was the vice president and co-founder of In Your Ear Music and Recording Corp. He has shared the stage with music legends such as Bob Dylan, Bonnie Raitt, Crosby, Stills & Nash, Bruce Hornsby and Springsteen. \nSpringsteen and Thompson remained friends after Steel Mill broke up, and would sometimes play together on stage when Springsteen was in the area. \nThompson released several solo albums over the years. He also had a passion for sailing on the Chesapeake Bay. \nAlex Napoliello may be reached at anapoliello@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter @alexnapoNJ .
