Carey was visiting San Francisco from Quebec, Canada on a solo backpacking trip and also planned to make her way to Europe.\nOfficers investigating Carey's death reached out to Marin County authorities investigating the fatal shooting of Steve Carter because of the similarities of the two cases. Carter, a tantra yoga instructor, was found fatally shot on a trail near Fairfax, California on Monday.\nSteve Carter in undated photo\nKPIX-TV Marin County and San Francisco police investigators traveled to Portland, Oregon, where the three suspects were taken into custody Wednesday. Police said the suspects had items that belonged to Carey.\nThe San Francisco Chronicle reports the three \"still had the gun they used when they were busted in Oregon and were still driving the victim's station wagon, which they tried to sell at a Portland soup kitchen, authorities and witnesses said Thursday. But before they could pawn off the Volkswagen Jetta, investigators tracked down the three using the car's GPS system, officials said. The gun was recovered.\"\nMarin County authorities said earlier on Thursday that the suspects would be sent back to California sometime next week.", "external_links": ["http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2015/10/06/woman-found-dead-in-golden-gate-park-identified-as-canadian-resident/", "http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2015/10/08/steve-carter-tantra-yoga-death-gun-found/", "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/10/07/fd53ff37-896b-4867-8fe3-147db5288b05/thumbnail/620x350/941978bbd709cbc5592f8f000d85d4f0/stevecarter.jpg", "http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2015/10/06/prominent-therapist-shot-dead-dog-injured-on-marin-trail/", "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/10/07/1af657ee-6157-4521-a786-8629b10da195/thumbnail/620x350/982dc38f133e715568ab3cf7c5ee20f7/audrey-carey-golden-gate-park.jpg", "http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2015/10/08/audrey-carey-golden-gate-park-murder-suspects-steve-carter/", "http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/Cops-Gun-linked-to-Marin-trail-killing-recovered-6559002.php"], "published": "2015-10-09T12:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:42:59.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
