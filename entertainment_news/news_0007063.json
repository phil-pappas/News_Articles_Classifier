It is a not bleach but needs the presence of oxygen donor to act on the stains effectively. Normally the oxygen bleaching such as using hydrogen peroxide is conducted at high temperatures of 950 C, which has adverse effects on the fabric and involves high cost. \n\nThus, addition of TAED as an activator is an effective way to reduce the temperature of oxygen based bleach. TAED is odourless, colourless, storage stable, and safe & easy to handle. TAED is mainly used in the detergents and additives for laundry washing on large scale.\n\nEurope dominated the TAED market in 2014, accounting for over 53% of the market by consumption and around 40% of the market by value. The market by value and consumption for the rest of the world (RoW) was the second largest in 2014 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 2.45% by consumption from 2015 to 2020 to garner a market size of 28.42KT by 2020 from 24.58KT in 2014. TAED market for Asia-Pacific region is projected to grow at the second fastest CAGR of 2.20% by consumption and 2.93% by value from 2015 to 2020. \n\nTAED is also used in the automatic dishwashing systems and acts as a cleaning agent in household cleaning products. As TAED is a bleach activator, it helps speed up the bleaching reaction at lower temperature of about 400 C and helps making the bleach well-suited with the enzymes during the stain removal process. It does negligible harm to the environment and is biodegradable. It has very low toxicity and can be easily removed during the sewage water treatment process. It has negligible effect on air but some amount of emissions to agricultural land may occur through sewage sludge and adversely affect the soil. TAED also finds applications in hard surface cleaning, laundry liquids, dairy & food cleaning, industrial cleaners, and so on. It is widely used in the European region and is slowly capturing the market in North America Asia-Pacific, RoW with growing detergent use and increasing hygiene concerns. \n\nThis market research study provides a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the global TAED market and aims to estimate the global market of TAED for 2015 and to project the expected demand of the same by 2020. Various secondary sources such as directories, encyclopedia, and databases are used to identify and collect information useful for this extensive commercial study of the TAED market. Various primary sources like related industry experts, consultants and so on are interviewed so as to get an overall idea about the TAED market and understand various qualitative aspects concerning the TAED market.
