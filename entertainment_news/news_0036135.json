Why are they just going to trust this super-powered alien? What if he does decide to turn against us?\"Affleck added that his Batman has \"found himself in a place of harbouring a tremendous amount of rage for Superman\". \"So it's how he got there, and what that's done to him, and what that's done to people around him like Alfred, who are, I think, very scared and worried for him. It's something that's interesting and new.\" \n© Warner Bros. / DC Entertainment Affleck also noted that it would be a \"dream\" to direct a solo Batman film, as long as he's got the \"right idea and the right take on it\".Back in July, it was revealed that he was working with DC Comics veteran Geoff Johns on a solo outing for The Dark Knight.Meanwhile, new stills of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice were released last week, giving us our first look at Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman in action .Director Zack Snyder also praised the film's \"purpose-built\" Batmobile .
