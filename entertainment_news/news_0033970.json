The much-awaited announcement will be made tomorrow. \nDorsey has been temporarily assigned as the CEO since June 2015, when former chief executive Dick Costolo resigned. According to reports carried by tech blog Re/code, Twitter wants to reappoint Dorsey as its permanent CEO as early as Thursday and will allow him to manage Square at the same time. (ALSO READ: Snoop Dogg wants to be the next Twitter CEO after Dick Costolo?) \nThe social media site has been searching a suitable candidate for the top post since the past three months, ever since Costolo announced his resignation. Dorsey, was always considered the most eligible person to lead, but his commitment role in Square is believed to be the reason for the not elevating him. \nWithin the inner circles of the bird, Dorsey is considered a credible figure, who has a vision for the product he co-founded. There are high expectations from him to overcome the financial woes lately suffered by Twitter.If Dorsey agrees to the offer, it would be interesting to see how he handles it along with the calling shots at Square. \nModified Date: October 1, 2015 2:09 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T23:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:22:58.921+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
