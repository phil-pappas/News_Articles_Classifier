File - In this 1963 file photo, Scottish actor Sean Connery, left, actress Phyllis Newman and conductor Leonard Bernstein are shown at the US premiere of the James Bond movie \"Dr. No\" in New York. \"Dr. No\" was the first official Bond film adaptation of an Ian Fleming novel. The movie didn't have anything like the budget of future Bond films, including the upcoming \"Spectre\" which has its World Premiere on Monday Oct. 26, 2015, in London. Connery would play Bond in five further authorized films, before returning from a 12-year hiatus to star in the unofficial \"Never Say Never Again\" in 1983. (AP Photo, File) \nJust like many elements of the films themselves, the marketing of the Bond series follows a successful template. As one Bond film ends, the quest for details about the next one begins. \nAnd those involved with the lucrative — and hugely expensive — franchise have no qualms in walking the well-trodden path so \"Spectre\" can more than recoup its hefty outlays. \nThe buzz over Daniel Craig's fourth and potentially last outing as the British secret agent with the 007 moniker started almost as soon as the well-received \"Skyfall\" hit the screens back in 2012. Now, there's almost as much anticipation about who will eventually replace Craig than for \"Spectre\" itself, which has already garnered largely positive reviews following Wednesday's first showing to the press. File - In this Apr. 25, 1963 file photo, Sean Connery and Italian actress Daniela Bianchi are seen in Istanbul, Turkey. The pair were in the country filming the second Bond film, 'From Russia with Love.' Connery was playing the British secret agent for the second time in what many critics consider to be one of the best Bond film of all. His suave but menacing Bond remains the standard for many Bond fans.

This is the third time that the Royal Albert Hall will host the World Premiere, following \"Die Another Day\" in 2002 and \"Skyfall.\" Prince William, his wife Kate and brother Prince Harry are all expected to be in attendance. \nThe Associated Press has been covering the Bond franchise from its more subdued beginnings with \"Dr. No\" over 50 years ago. Here are some memorable moments surrounding the glamorous promotion of Bond films, as captured by photographers from The AP. File - In this January 10, 1969 file photo, Sean Connery's replacement as James Bond, George Lazenby is pictured with British actress Diana Rigg. The two are captured during takes of \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\" at Schilthorn near Muerren, Switzerland. Though the Australian actor never played Bond again following disagreements with producers, his one outing is considered one of the best. The film's ending is perhaps the most memorable in the entire Bond series. The upcoming new Bond film \"Spectre\" starring Daniel Craig has its World Premiere on Monday Oct. 26, 2015, in London.

Aided by his natural charm and comic timing, Moore's seven Bond films were more light-hearted than those that had gone before. His films saw a proliferation of gadgets, which grated with many Bond fans. The upcoming new Bond film \"Spectre\" starring Daniel Craig has its World Premiere on Monday Oct. 26, 2015, in London.

Craig has indicated that Spectre may be the last time he will don James Bond's tuxedo. His portrayal of Bond has won widespread acclaim, notably in his first outing in 2006's \"Casino Royale.\" (AP Photo/Alastair Grant, File)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T15:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:14:48.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
