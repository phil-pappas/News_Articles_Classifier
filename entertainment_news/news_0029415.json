New traditional and LED offerings were developed to better meet the needs of lighting professionals by being compact in design and offering high quality, powerful light that brings out the rich colors accurately on stage.\n“Light is critical to live design professionals, and OSRAM is dedicated to delivering exceptional light for exceptional performances,” said Mark DeLorenzo, entertainment business manager, OSRAM SYLVANIA. “Our new lamps and fixtures being shown at LDI 2015 demonstrate our continued commitment to deliver high quality lighting products for the entertainment industry.”\nLight is efficient\nCreated especially for intimate theaters and small stages, the KREIOS Fresnel White, KREIOS Fresnel RGBW, and KREIOS Profile White Fixtures provide flicker-free, exceptional luminosity in an efficient package. With their efficiency, illumination quality, and ease of use, the KREIOS Fresnel and Profile can help lighting professionals deliver an outstanding performance night after night, year after year. Coming soon, these fixtures have an advanced optical system with a linear zoom and are compact and lightweight for easy installation. The LED fixtures use only 80W and offer smooth, flicker-free dimming; adjustable dimming PWM frequency; a classic tungsten dimming simulation; strobe and pulse effects; and simple-to-manage controls with DMX512 or onboard displays. The KREIOS Fresnel White is a versatile and robust fixture that weighs less than 9 lbs. and shows performances in their intended light. With a four-channel mixing system, predefined color macros for color temperatures from 2800K to 6500K, and an emergency function to prevent data loss, the KREIOS Fresnel RGBW brings extra drama to the theater. The multifunctional KREIOS Profile features a dual-optic condenser lens, allowing for precision focus and four adjustable shutters.\nLight is tireless\nAvailable now, the KREIOS FLx LED Fixture provides superior illumination in a variety of spaces from catwalks, over the stage, black box theatres, the wings of the stage, or even as a safety light outside the loading dock. It delivers a high luminous intensity equal to 500W tungsten fixtures but by using only 90W, delivering 80 percent energy savings which can translate in lower electricity and ambient cooling costs. The fixture has a 5000 lumen output, warm 3500K color temperature, and high CRI of 92 which helps ensure reliable color rendering of costumes thanks to OSRAM OSLON® LEDs. With a life rating of 40,000 hours (L70), twenty times more life than traditional halogen work light fixtures, the LED flood light also provides significant savings in replacement lamp and labor costs.\nCompact, lightweight, and easy to install, the KREIOS FLx also has passive cooling, which makes it completely silent, and the black housing color maintains low visibility when not in use. The diffused glass reduces glare and the fixture delivers no UV/IR emissions, providing for a more comfortable workspace. The IP65 outdoor-rated fixture is also dimmable and includes a gel frame, enabling quick and easy color changes.\nLight is brilliant\nThe new Lok-it!® 1000W/PS Brilliant lamp improves upon the already highly successful Lok-it! HTI® 1000/PS lamp. The new Brilliant design incorporates changes to the lamp base which allows greater cooling at the press seal, and changes to the electrodes and fill components, giving it an extremely stable arc with a super high CRI of 95. When only the very best will do, this new lamp provides an elite, upgrade solution to the dozens of fixture models already using the Lok-it! HTI 1000W/PS lamp. The new Lok-it! 1400W/PS Brilliant lamp has already found a home inside the new Clay Paky Scenius and Spheriscan. Able to be run at both 1400W and 1200W, this new addition to the Lok-it! HTI Power Series of lamps also has a super high CRI of 95, allowing for a full spectrum of deep, saturated colors, while at the same time providing true skin tones with its 6000K daylight-like color temperature.\nLight is compact\nThe SIRIUS HRI® 100W and 440W are two new lamps in the ever expanding SIRIUS HRI family of compact arc reflector lamps. The smallest of the family, the new SIRIUS HRI 100W will be launched in early 2016. The higher powered 440W lamp comes in 440W and 440W S versions, with the “S” representing a shorter focal point for use in fixtures with a more compact optical design. Many new fixtures are already in the market using these new 440W lamps, with more on the way.\nFor more information about OSRAM entertainment lighting solutions from OSRAM SYLVANIA, go to http://www.osram-americas.com/entertainment or visit booth #945 at LDI 2015, October 23-25, 2015 at the Las Vegas Convention Center in Las Vegas, NV.\nOSRAM, KREIOS, HTI, Lok-it! and SIRIUS HRI are registered trademarks of OSRAM GmbH.\nSYLVANIA is a registered trademark of OSRAM SYLVANIA Inc.\nAll other trademarks are those of their respective owners.\nABOUT OSRAM SYLVANIA AND ITS NORTH AMERICAN DISPLAY/OPTIC DIVISION:\nOSRAM SYLVANIA is part of OSRAM Americas, a group of OSRAM companies located in North and South America.
