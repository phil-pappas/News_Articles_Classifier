Comment Neosho Daily News - Neosho, MO By Kay Hively Posted Oct. 13, 2015 at 8:38 PM By Kay Hively Posted Oct. 13, 2015 at 8:38 PM When Judy Haas Smith learned there was a wealth of material about Dan Longwell in the archives at Columbia University in New York City, she knew she had to write a book. Five years after her discovery, Smith has authored “Larger Than Life: The Legacy of Daniel and Mary Fraser Longwell.” The book tells the story of the Neosho-connected Longwells and their roles in the founding of LIFE magazine. There is no doubt that the influence and vision of Dan Longwell brought LIFE to life as the first and most important “picture magazine” in history, a magazine that told a story with photographs and paintings. The story of LIFE is a story unto itself, but the story of the Longwells, in part, is a story of their influence on Neosho. Though born in Omaha, Neb., Longwell came to Neosho as a boy and never forgot the farm where his father tried homesteading. In later years, he bought the farm in the tiny Reagan community west of Neosho. That land was so beloved by Longwell that he and his wife chose to be buried in Reagan Cemetery. Judy Smith knew the Longwells when she was a young woman living in New York and working as a “clip girl” at LIFE. She was required to read a certain number of newspapers each day and to clip any reference to anything that LIFE was working on at the time. Later, when the Longwells retired from LIFE, they considered retiring in New York or in London, but settled in Neosho and lived on the same block as Smith’s family. Although they lived in town, the couple spent many hours on the old farm in Reagan. This was the relationship that Smith had with the Longwells. In her book, she wrote much about the Longwells in New York, but also captured some of their life in Neosho, where she believes the Longwells had a profound influence. Longwell started the idea for the flowerbox program in Neosho by bringing many elements together. He got the money for the program from the Rockefeller Foundation in New York and got several groups in Neosho to plan and execute it. Because of that, Neosho became known as the Flowerbox City. Longwell also gave the Flowerbox program worldwide publicity with stories and pictures in LIFE magazine. “Dan had a way of managing people to make a team,” Smith said. “He was soft spoken, but got people to do things together.” The Longwell Museum at Crowder College was named for the couple. Smith is happy it has affected so many students. The museum just reopened after a renovation. The public can see the “new” Longwell from 5 to 7 p.m. Thursday, when Smith and Crowder College President Dr. Jennifer Methvin will hold a formal public discussion of “Larger Than Life.” Afterward, Smith will autograph books that are sold for $20, with $10 donated to the museum. A drawing for free books will be provided for Crowder students in attendance. Page 2 of 2 - Smith has donated to aid to the college in remodeling the museum. Some of the improvements include movable walls for future displays and glass cabinets that house works contained in the museum. Following the book signing, guests are invited to stay for the Crowder College Theatre production of “The Hound of the Baskervilles” opening night. The show begins at 7:30. Tickets will be available at the door. Ask people on the streets of Neosho about Longwell and likely few will know whom he was or that he lived in Neosho, according to Smith. Perhaps in time, that will change and Neosho will come to know about the man who was on a first-name basis with such literary and artistic giants as Edna Ferber, Ernest Hemingway, McKinley Kantor, Ogden Nash and Winston Churchill. For her years of research and writing about a remarkable couple who lived in Neosho, Smith is this week’s good neighbor.
