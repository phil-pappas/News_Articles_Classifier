The free performance will be offered on Tuesday, Oct. 20 at 7:30 p.m. in the Sara M. Snell Music Theater at SUNY Potsdam's Crane School of Music. The concert will also stream live on Crane's YouTube channel. For more information, visit www.potsdam.edu/crane . \nDirector Bartlett Sher's season-opening new production of Verdi's masterful \"Otello\" probes the Moor's dramatic downfall, with an outstanding cast led by Aleksandrs Antonenko in the title role, Sonya Yoncheva as Desdemona, Željko Lučić as Iago and Pittas as Cassio. Yannick Nézet-Séguin conducts the production. \nOften cited as Italian opera's greatest tragedy, \"Otello\" is a miraculous union of music and drama, a masterpiece as profound philosophically, as it is thrilling theatrically. The opera brings to live Shakespeare's tale of \"Othello,\" which follows the rise and fall of a great hero who can't control his jealousy. \nVerdi's \"Otello\" will screen live from the Metropolitan Opera stage at 12:55 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 17 at Potsdam's Roxy Theater. There will be an encore screening at 6:30 p.m. on Sunday, Oct. 25. \nThe opera will be performed in Italian, with English subtitles. The approximate running time is three hours, including intermission. \nThe 2015-16 season of The Met: Live in HD is sponsored in the North Country by SUNY Potsdam's Crane School of Music and J.S. Cinemas. All productions will be shown live worldwide on Saturdays. There will also be encore presentations offered on Sundays locally. Doors open a half-hour before show time, and there is immediate seating for advance ticket holders. \nIn The Met: Live in HD, robotic cameras, strategically placed around and behind the stage, capture the beauty and power of live performance from striking angles, and heighten attention to both performance and production. Intermission features and English subtitles bring the stories to life. \nTickets prices are the lowest available in the nation: $18 for an adult, $15 for senior citizens, $12 for students and $9 for youth age 18 and under. Tickets are available by calling the Community Performance Series Box Office at (315) 267-2277, by visiting the Roxy Theater in downtown Potsdam or stopping by the CPS Box Office in the lobby of SUNY Potsdam's Performing Arts Center.
