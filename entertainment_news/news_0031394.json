Peter Andre, Jeremy Vine, Jay McGuiness, Ainsley Harriott, Daniel O’Donnell, Iwan Thomas and Anthony Ogogo (Guy Levy/BBC) \nHere’s a round-up of how things are going in rehearsal rooms across the country: Anita Rani and Gleb Savchenko \nCountryfile presenter Anita and her partner Gleb have been using the hashtag #teamGLITA, which is like glitter… and like their names… got it yet? \nThe new professional seems to be taking an unorthodox approach to training, apparently ordering Anita into a cold bath. My @bbcstrictly homework tonight from @Gleb_Savchenko to have an ICE bath. The cold tap is running as I type – is this a good idea? \n— anita rani (@itsanitarani) September 29, 2015 Sorry #hackney the screams were me getting into an ice bath. Freezing my ass off @Gleb_Savchenko #nopainnogain pic.twitter.com/DzFKc6cgAx \n— anita rani (@itsanitarani) September 29, 2015 \nTheir warm-up song is Eye Of The Tiger, which is a very good call. Promoted stories Anthony Ogogo and Oti Mabuse \nThese two have been working hard, as evidenced by this photo of them zonked on the floor. Ainsley Harriott and Natalie Lowe \nWe bet rehearsals with TV chef Ainsley are fun. At 58, he’s the oldest in the competition – but also one of the most enthusiastic. \n— Natalie Lowe (@RealNatalieLowe) September 11, 2015 Carol Kirkwood and Pasha Kovalev \nCarol seems to be taking rehearsals with a healthy sense of humour – and scepticism: . @PashaKovalev you are having a laugh! I'll need a crane to get my leg that high!!xxx pic.twitter.com/rPWAzFI5Kn \n— Carol Kirkwood (@carolkirkwood) October 1, 2015 . @PashaKovalev get your steel capped boots on honey! Be with you in 10 ;0)xxx \n— Carol Kirkwood (@carolkirkwood) October 1, 2015 It's so hard working with @PashaKovalev … NOT!xxx pic.twitter.com/9lLtNWSks0 \n— Carol Kirkwood (@carolkirkwood) September 16, 2015 Daniel O’Donnell and Kristina Rihanoff \nLittle has been seen from the O’Donnell-Rihanoff rehearsal room, but it looks like they had a very nice tea-time with Daniel’s wife. Had the loveliest day out and about with @Majodonnell and Daniel O'Donnell! The charleston is progressing amazingly! pic.twitter.com/fsT39LebTl \n— Kristina Rihanoff (@KRihanoff) September 30, 2015 Georgia May Foote and Giovanni Pernice \nBut what’s this from #TeamGG? “Ola Jordan and Iwan decided to try and sabotage our rehearsals today! Go away!!”, said Georgia, alongside a photo of Iwan flashing his chest at the camera. What hijinks. \nTheir training looks pretty manic, though. This is the reaction when @georgiafoote realized there is one day left @bbcstrictly !! #teamgg pic.twitter.com/JbtUGMY1W1 \n— Giovanni Pernice (@pernicegiovann1) September 23, 2015 Helen George and Aljaz Skorjanec \nAljaz reports that Helen is “working the props like a pro” in this picture, but we’re not convinced. Iwan Thomas and Ola Jordan \nIwan has been revelling in getting some new gear… Never thought I could be excited about receiving new dance shoes…. I've changed #BillyElliot pic.twitter.com/aTKZX2WxHY \n— Iwan Thomas MBE (@Iwanrunner) October 1, 2015 \nGetting dressed up… \nAnd getting his partner a birthday present. My perfect birthday present from my perfect partner @Iwanrunner @bbcstrictly 😂💃🏼🏃🏼 pic.twitter.com/H48hu87Rhg \n— Ola Jordan (@The_OlaJordan) October 1, 2015 Jamelia and Tristan MacManus \nJamelia and Tristan have shared little from the rehearsal room, but we can tell they’re working hard from this post: Jay McGuiness and Aliona Vilani \nJay has absolutely, definitely got the hang of the waltz. Probably. Our Waltz with @JayMcGuiness is totally ready 😆😎👊🏼👊🏼👫 pic.twitter.com/wN2LjSvoGZ \n— Aliona Kavanagh (@AlionaVilani) September 30, 2015 Jeremy Vine and Karen Clifton \nPoor Karen has been having to miss the Great British Bake Off for training with Jeremy. But! The dance is complete. Missing #GBBO .. Training intensely w @theJeremyVine till 10pm but also thinking about cakes!! #ilovecakes \n— Karen Clifton (@karen_hauer) September 30, 2015 Annnndddd I'm happy. Got my wallet,got my mind and @theJeremyVine and I have got our dance done! Now time to practice it 522 times … \n— Karen Clifton (@karen_hauer) September 30, 2015 Katie Derham and Anton du Beke \nThe Katie and Anton practice room remains a mystery, which is a shame, because we bet it’s really, really fun. You guys are all GREAT! Thank you so much for so many wonderful comments about strictly last night. That @TheAntonDuBeke is good, isn't he?! \n— Katie Derham (@thekatiederham) September 27, 2015 Kellie Bright and Kevin Clifton \nEastEnders star Kellie has been doing her homework. I am actually cha cha cha'ing around my living room while my husband is watching Entourage…. What has happened to me @keviclifton ???? \n— Kellie Bright (@kelliebright76) September 30, 2015 Kirsty Gallacher and Brendan Cole \nKirsty and Brendan participated in ‘Take Your Professional Dance Partner To Work Day’ \n— Kirsty Gallacher (@TheRealKirstyG) September 29, 2015 Peter Andre and Janette Manrara \n…While Peter Andre and Janette Manrara got ahead in the selfie game.
