According to HollywoodLife , the pop diva is actually a huge fan of the latest \" Made in the A.M. \" offering, which many believe was inspired by her. A so-called source tells the gossip site that Swift has no reason to be mad because the song is pretty good. \"Taylor isn't coming out and bragging that the song's about her, but the word is she's happy about it,\" the source says. \"It's a great song, why wouldn't she be?\" \"Perfect\" came out on Friday, October 16 as the second single off One Direction's fifth studio effort, which is scheduled to arrive on November 13. Some lyrics that are apparently referring to the 25-year-old superstar include, \"If you like cameras flashing every time we go out/ If you're looking for someone to write your break-up songs about baby I'm perfect.\" Co-written by Louis Tomlinson and Harry Styles , who happens to be Swift's ex-boyfriend, the song was performed live in full for the first time while the four-piece brought their tour to Dublin's 3Arena later on Friday. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T08:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:18:43.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
