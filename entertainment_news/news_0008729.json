Curated by Alison Ferris, the exhibition is on view through Jan. 3 at the PMA, 7 Congress Square. \nThe Biennial provides a comprehensive overview of the many facets of Maine’s contemporary art scene. As this year’s edition began to take shape, Ferris became captivated by the beloved Maine saying, “You can’t get there from here,” finding inspiration in the parallels between the phrase and the creative process of visual artists. This inspiration influenced a diverse collection of artworks for the Biennial that presents a comprehensive and cohesive narrative about the state and the artists connected to it. \nFerris’ career has spanned more than 20 years, and included positions at institutions throughout Maine and the country. She is currently the curator of the John Michael Kohler Arts Center in Sheboygan, Wis., where she has organized critically acclaimed exhibitions. \n“You Can’t Get There From Here” includes established Maine artists who have created notable new bodies of work and those who have traveled outside of Maine and are becoming known outside its borders. It also represents the first major institutional appearance for several young, emerging artists, showcasing the next wave of Maine artists and affording them the opportunity to make initial introductions to national art audiences. \n“With each Biennial, we have the opportunity to highlight the incredible works by artists connected to our state,” said PMA Director Mark Bessire, “and for this year’s Biennial, Ferris has seized that opportunity and taken it to new heights — producing a phenomenal exhibition and experience.” \n“You Can’t Get There From Here” is the ninth Biennial at the Portland Museum of Art. Funded through the generous bequest of Port Clyde’s William E. Thon, the PMA Biennial is intended to highlight artists with meaningful connections to Maine and enrich the cultural lives of the people of the state. \nInspired by his own experience and love of biennials, Thon entrusted the PMA with the means to offer rich contemporary art experiences to its audiences. Though the format of the PMA Biennial has evolved over the past decade, the commitment of the PMA and mission of the Biennial remains steadfast — to put forth a remarkable collection from Maine artists that establishes a cohesive narrative of art and creativity in Maine. \nThis is the first year that the PMA has organized the Biennial exhibition entirely through invitation, based on dozens of studio visits that Ferris conducted over a six-month period. Midcoast artists selected to show include Meghan Brady and Gideon Bok of Camden; Ken Greenleaf of Waldoboro; Dennis Pinette of Belfast; and Warren Seelig of Rockland, who will facilitate an all-day Artist Intervention Thursday, Oct. 15. \n“You Can’t Get There From Here: The 2015 Portland Museum of Art Biennial” is made possible by the William E. and Helen E. Thon Endowment Fund. Corporate sponsorship is provided by Norton Insurance • Financial Services, with media sponsorship is provided by WCSH 6 and The Portland Phoenix. The show is accompanied by a catalog with an essay by Ferris, along with descriptions of each artist’s work from the exhibition. \nPMA admission is free Fridays from 5 to 9 p.m. For hours and other information, visit portlandmuseum.org . \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
