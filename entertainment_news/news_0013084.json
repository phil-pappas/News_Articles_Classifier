We won't have to wait too long to find out, as the scheduling details and lineup have now been confirmed for the soap's upcoming Come Dine with Me specials.Hollyoaks Does Come Dine with Me will air across five nights on E4 from Monday, October 19 as the popular soap celebrates its 20th anniversary week. © Rex Features / Ken McKay/ITVKieron Richardson The fun spinoff series will be broadcast in a 7.30pm slot each evening, straight after the usual E4 first look screening of Hollyoaks.Jimmy McKenna (Jack Osborne), Jacqueline Boatswain (Simone Loveday), Jessica Fox (Nancy Osborne), Kirsty-Leigh Porter (Leela Lomax), Jessica Ellis (Tegan Lomax) and Kieron Richardson (Ste Hay) have all been confirmed for the series.McKenna is first up on day one as he aims to impress with a menu of Italian favourites, although he's quickly hampered by the fact that he's never really cooked before.Boatswain follows on day two with some unusual food choices, while Fox hosts a 1950s-inspired evening on day three - complete with cake decorating lessons and a spot of competitive colouring. © Lime PicturesJessica Fox There's a sister act on day four as on-screen siblings Porter and Ellis team up with a fun and relaxed vibe - complete with a nearly naked butler to spice things up. This could be the most fiery night, as show bosses have teased some \"biting critique and dramatic turns\" at the table.Richardson is last up in the finale as he honours Hollyoaks' launch year with a 1995 theme. His former co-star Bronagh Waugh (Cheryl Brady) pops up to offer help in the kitchen, while there's another surprise in store with some period entertainment.Come Dine with Me sees participants compete against each other by hosting dinner parties for the other contestants. Each host is then rated by their rivals at the end of the evening, and the Hollyoaks specials see a £1,000 prize for charity on offer.Read more Hollyoaks news and spoilersDigital Spy Soap Scoop video - hit play below for gossip on Ben and Kathy's EastEnders reunion, Aaron's Emmerdale arrest, important news for Fiz and Tyrone in Coronation Street and a shock kidnapping in Hollyoaks. function onTemplateLoaded(experienceID) { bcExp = brightcove.getExperience(experienceID); modVP = bcExp.getModule(APIModules.VIDEO_PLAYER); modExp = bcExp.getModule(APIModules.EXPERIENCE); modCon = bcExp.getModule(APIModules.CONTENT); modVP.addEventListener(BCMediaEvent.BEGIN, onVideoStart); modVP.addEventListener(BCMediaEvent.STOP, onVideoStop); modVP.addEventListener(BCMediaEvent.PROGRESS, onVideoProgress); } #_containermyExperience4532176223001 { height: 100%; } // InSkin integration parameters: InSkinParams['myInSkin14532176223001'] = { 'srv_SectionID': '', 'srv_SectionIDPlay': '123757', 'srv_Keywords': '', 'plr_ContentID': 'myExperience4532176223001', 'plr_ContentType': 'BRIGHTCOVE3', 'plr_ContentW': 558, 'plr_ContentH': 314, 'plr_NoSkinContentResize': true, 'plr_NoSkinContentW': 618, 'plr_NoSkinContentH': 348, 'plr_NoSkinInSkinResize': true, 'plr_NoSkinInSkinW': 618, 'plr_NoSkinInSkinH': 348, 'plr_ResizeOnHideSkin': true, 'plr_HideSkinOnExternalAd': 'all', 'plr_ShowSkinAfterExternalAd': true, 'cnt_SmartPlayer': true }; // create the InSkin object: var InSkinObject4532176223001 = new InSkin.Base('myInSkin14532176223001'); brightcove.createExperiences(); if (!navigator.userAgent.match(/Android/i)) { InSkinObject4532176223001.init(); ai_type=\"video\"; } Get the Inside Soap magazine on your iPhone or iPad", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:23:25.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
