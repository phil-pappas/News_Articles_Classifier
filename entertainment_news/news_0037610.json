Hurricane warnings, hurricane watches and tropical storm warnings were in effect for all of northwestern Mexico's coast.\nPatricia is slowly moving northward at 10 mph.\nThe latest animated infrared satellite image shows Hurricane Patricia looming off Mexico’s Pacific Coast. The NHC also recorded by far the lowest pressure ever measured in a Pacific hurricane. Meanwhile, the 200 mph winds are well beyond the 157 mph threshold to qualify as a Category 5 storm.\n\"Patricia is estimated to have intensified [100 mph] in the past 24 hours,\" the NHC advisory said . \"This is a remarkable feat, with only Linda of 1997 intensifying at this rate in the satellite era.\"\nHurricane Patricia’s storm track pushes into Mexico’s Pacific Coast resort towns . Patricia will still be at Category 5 strength when it reaches the coastline of the Mexican states of Jalisco, Colima and Nayarit later Friday. Resort city Puerto Vallarta to Mexico's second largest city, Guadalajara, are in the storm's path. It is expected to dump up to 20 inches of rain over the Mexican states of Nayarit, Jalisco, Colima, Michoacan and Guerrero through Saturday.\nThe rain could produce floods and mudslides. A storm surge is also expected to produce coastal flooding near the site where the hurricane reaches landfall, and ocean surf will likely cause rip current conditions.\nThe monster hurricane will bring catastrophic winds as well as flooding, massive storm surge and big, powerful waves onshore. Forecasters say hurricane-force winds extend out 30 miles from the storm's center and tropical storm-force winds reach out 175 miles.\nIt is expected to weaken as it moves north and northeastward across western and northern Mexico.\nOctober 1959 was the last time a Category 5 hurricane slammed Mexico's west coast. That storm killed 1,800 people.\n Hurricane Karl takes aim at Mexico Jova gains power, takes aim on Mexico Tropical Storm Erika takes aim at Texas Patricia churns northwest in the Pacific", "external_links": ["http://www.weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/hurricane-patricia-mexico-coast", "http://i.imgur.com/H1U4RTL.png", "http://www.ssd.noaa.gov/goes/west/epac/rb-animated.gif", "https://facebook.com/unitedpress", "http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPEP5+shtml/231144.shtml", "http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPEP5+shtml/231448.shtml", "https://www.facebook.com/UnitedPress", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2015/10/22/extremely-dangerous-category-4-hurricane-patricia-to-slam-west-coast-of-mexico-friday/"], "published": "2015-10-23T12:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:35:51.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
