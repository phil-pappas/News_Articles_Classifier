She then kept him subdued with a Japanese sword she keeps near her bed.\nDolley says she learned to fight as a teenager in the Society for Creative Anachronism, a group that recreates skills of the Middle Ages. She also skates with roller derby team Naptown Roller Girls.\nPolice responding to Dolley's 911 call arrested 30-year-old Jacob Wessel of Greenwood, charging him with residential entry. Police say he forced open the home's back door. Police reports say he was taken to a hospital because he was high on an unknown substance.\n___\nInformation from: The Indianapolis Star, http://www.indystar.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://indy.st/1OsFqSo"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:38:23.241+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
