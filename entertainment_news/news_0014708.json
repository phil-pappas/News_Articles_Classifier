Even today I keep asking for work and I'm not ashamed of this,\" Anu said at the launch of a reality TV show here.\n\"We have such fantastic talent in India, and there are some great Marathi singers, great sound producers, great sound engineers, and a great breed of lyric writers. But the problem is that you need a platform,\" he added.\nAnu has backed newcomers as a judge by giving opportunities to youngsters on reality shows such as \"Indian Idol\" and \"Entertainment Ke Liye Kuch Bhi Karega\".\nAccording to him, it's important to give the youngsters an opportunity with these reality shows. But his personal struggle was a very difficult one.\n\"When I was very young, around 11 or 12, when I started actually meeting people, trying to get work, I had to meet producers, directors but I didn't have the platform.\n\"You had to knock the doors of the great directors and producers; of course I needed the work and was desperate for work. I remember one of the producers saying, 'we have R.D. Burman, we have Laxmikant-Pyarelal, we've got Kalyanji-Anandji with us, why should we take you?' And they were such great composers that to get a foothold in the industry was very tough for me. There was no other platform,\" he said.\n\"Cut to 2015, things have changed, there are reality shows where people come in and get a chance to showcase their talent. And this is upping things forward now,\" Anu added.\nAnu Malik composed the music of \"Dum Laga Ke Haisha\" and \"Welcome Back\" this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:56:28.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
