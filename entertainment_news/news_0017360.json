Production was halted indefinitely, but resumed seven months later. Diesel felt continuing the film would honor Walker's legacy, and his respect for the series' devoted fanbase.\n\"Paul said, 'You know (\"Furious) 7\" could bomb and (\"Furious) 8' is still guaranteed.' When somebody who is like your brother makes a promise, you feel inclined to want to honor that,\" Diesel said.\nDiesel shared Walker's vision on the longevity of the series.\n\"He took a lot of pride in this franchise and he'd be smiling down at the idea of us actually doing what we talked about, which is going to the 10th chapter,\" Diesel said.\nWhile that remains unclear, \"Furious 8\" is confirmed for a 2017 release, and rumors had circulated that Diesel would direct that installment. The actor has previously directed a short called \"Los Bandoleros\" with the \"Furious\" cast that explains each character's backstory.\nBut Diesel dismissed the notion of getting back behind the camera for a feature - at least for now - despite pressure from a source very close to the actor.\n\"My mom wants me to direct tomorrow,\" Diesel said, \"I'm like, 'Mom, it takes about a year of your life to go and direct. There's so many other movies I got to make.'\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T23:07:16.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
