His 54-yarder gave the Bears the lead earlier in the fourth quarter, and he also hit from 19 yards in the first half. All three makes were in the south end zone. \"I love that end zone,\" he said, \"because that's the wind I'm used to.\" Gould's plan at that end was to aim for the right upright. He's now 9-for-9 on field goals this season.\nToo cold\nZach Miller\nThe Bears' No. 2 tight end made two costly mistakes on a goal-to-go set of downs late in the second quarter. On first down from the 3, he was flagged for holding on a sweep to the left. On third down from the 1, as the lead-blocking fullback on an inside run for no gain, he was stood up at the point of attack. Blocking is not Miller's specialty, but the Bears believe he has significantly improved this year under the new regime.\nJust right\nJay Cutler\nIn playing through a 2-week-old hamstring strain, Cutler overcame a fourth-quarter interception to lead the Bears on a 12-play, 48-yard, game-winning field-goal drive. He took responsibility for the pick, which he threw on third-and-1 from the Raiders' 23. He said he left the throw too far toward the middle of the field. But he was poised and accurate on the final drive, completing 5 of 8 passes for 41 yards, including a pinpoint throw to Martellus Bennett on fourth-and-5. Bears receivers got out of bounds to stop the clock on three of the completions.\nPrivacy Policy Copyright Â© 2015, Chicago Tribune Chicago Bears Jay Cutler", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5611b74e/turbine/ct-three-bears-spt-1005-20151004"], "published": "2015-10-05T02:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:36:38.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
