Changes were also made to travel rules to ensure the viability of future international touring. \nMusicians approved the deal last week even though the union negotiating committee didn't formally recommend it. \nThe negotiating committee had said talent would go elsewhere unless Philadelphia's contract kept pace with other top orchestras. \nThe deal through next September pushes the musicians' base salary to $2,472 per week. \nBy then, the New York Philharmonic's base pay will hit $2,824 a week.
