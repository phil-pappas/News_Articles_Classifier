Taylor says that mess inspired her to change her behavior. \nSpeaking to Britain's NME , Taylor explains, \"I don't want to talk about it. But I send text messages now. If there seems to be some kind of misunderstanding, I go to someone's management, I get their number and I text them. It's an important lesson for anyone to learn in 2015.\" \nTaylor also talks with NME about finally becoming friends with Kanye West and putting their MTV VMA infamous 2009 incident behind them, when Kayne took the stage and interrupted Taylor's acceptance speech. \n\"Me and Kanye are on such good terms now, six years later,\" says Swift. \"It took a while.\" Taylor says Kanye's actually gotten to the point where he admits his mistakes. Case in point: his railing against the Grammys this past year when alt-rocker Beck, and not Beyonce, won Album of the Year. \n\"I was at dinner with Kanye a week after the Grammys,\" Taylor reveals. \"He stops what he's saying and he goes, ‘What is this song? I need to listen to this every day.’ I said, ‘It's Beck, it's on an album called Morning Phase , I think you've heard of it…’ We just burst out laughing. And he says, ‘Hey, sometimes I'm wrong.’\" \nCopyright © 2015,  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:30:45.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
