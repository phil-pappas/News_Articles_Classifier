Henson and Terrence Howard shut down rumors that they're fighting on the set of their drama series, \" Empire \". Instead of releasing a statement, the two decided to address the issue in a light way. Henson and Howard filmed hilarious videos in which they pretended to fight during what's supposed to be a table read with co-star Jussie Smollett and director Sanaa Hamri. \"You know what, I'm sick of you,\" Henson shouted at Howard, channeling her inner Cookie, \"You're such a diva. Since I got you this job, you think you're all that ... who do you think you are?\" Smollett looked terrified as he witnessed his on-screen parents' feud. A video posted by taraji p henson (@tarajiphenson) on Oct 7, 2015 at 2:34pm PDT Later in a second video, Henson and Howard showed that they had nothing but love for each other as they kissed and hugged each other. \"I love you Terrence!\" she told him. A video posted by taraji p henson (@tarajiphenson) on Oct 7, 2015 at 2:37pm PDT \"HA! Word on THA street is Terrence and I don't get along! Like I would fight to work with someone I DO NOT get along with?!Don't be silly,\" Henson wrote in the caption of the video. \"Empire\" is currently in its second season. The fourth episode, \"Poor Yorick\", will air next Wednesday, October 14 at 9 P.M. on FOX. A sneak-peek for the said outing teases an FBI raid on Empire and an arrest. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com More Empire News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T05:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:56:33.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
