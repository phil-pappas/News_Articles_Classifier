The article written by acclaimed travel writer Kara Franker is now live on Orbitz.com.\nKey West, Florida (PRWEB) October 14, 2015\nKey West Seaplanes ® the region's premier seaplane charter company is featured in an Orbitz article entitled \"Island-hop the Florida Keys by Seaplane\". Acclaimed travel writer Kara Frankel starts the beauty-packed article with \"Imagine no traffic, no crowds and no noise—except the soft buzzing of a propeller and untamed gusts of wind. Wild blue waters rise and fall with each breath the Gulf of Mexico takes\".\nWriter Franker continues to paint the picture of island-hopping the Florida Keys by exploring islands (aka \"the Keys\") along the Florida Keys including Islamorada and Little Palm Island via seaplane . Key West Seaplanes® has been offering this service for a number of years and often starts with guest hungry for an adventure in Miami and then ending up in Key West after numerous stops (or \"hops\") along the way. Franker adds \"Little Palm Island Resort & Spa is a collection of romantic bungalow suites that are only accessible by boat or, in your case, seaplane\". Having explored these areas with Key West Seaplanes® she has experienced the ultimate in luxury and convenience...flying to tropical island getaways without even getting her feet wet.\nKey West Seaplanes ® is based in Key West but their flight services span the entire state of Florida including Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, Boca Raton, West Palm, Naples, Ft. Myers and beyond. Key West Seaplanes®' Julie Ann Floyd adds \"In addition to all of the beautiful spots through the state and the Florida Keys that we service, we also offer high-end, private seaplane charters to the Bahamas and Caribbean \". She continues to say \"Of course we also offer private aerial sightseeing flights of Key West , the Florida Keys and surrounding areas. Many people really enjoy flying over the world-famous Seven Mile Bridge\",\n //www.prweb.com/releases/Key-West-Seaplanes-Orbitz/fly-Little-Palm-seaplane/prweb13021166.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://keywestseaplanes.com/Bahamas.html", "http://keywestseaplanes.com/index.html", "http://www.orbitz.com/blog/2015/09/island-hopping-florida-keys-by-seaplane/", "http://keywestseaplanes.com/charter_little-palm-seaplane-services.html", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/Key-West-Seaplanes-Orbitz/fly-Little-Palm-seaplane/prweb13021166.htm", "http://keywestseaplanes.com/dry_tortugas.html"], "published": "2015-10-14T18:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:49:22.493+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
