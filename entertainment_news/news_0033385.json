Songs by artists including Hawthorne Heights, Thursday, A Day to Remember, and more were removed by the music streaming giant on Monday (Oct. 19) after the two companies were unable to work out an agreement about unpaid royalties. The dispute began when Victory’s sister company, Another Victory Music Publishing, reported that Spotify owed them money.\nIn a statement released by the label on Tuesday (Oct. 20), they claim Spotify owes them compensation for 53 million streams; a statistic Spotify themselves provided. According to a report by Billboard , the 53 million streams would roughly come out to $23,000.\n“Victory Records’ catalog of music was pulled from Spotify last night [Monday] as a result of Spotify not properly paying publishing revenues due to Victory Records’ artists in blatant violation of US Copyright laws,” the press release from the record label states.\nJoining in on the accusations against Spotify's lack of compensation is Audiam , a service that helps artists get paid for the digital use of their music from YouTube and other digital services. At the moment, Victory and Audiam have an agreement and according to Victory, Spotify was essentially asking the label to breach that agreement. “Spotify knows we are in business with Audiam and were essentially asking us to breach/ignore that agreement,\" Victory's statement claims.\nAudiam Chief Executive Jeff Price also responded to the removal of their business partner's music on Monday evening. He states: “Spotify has pulled down the Victory Records sound recordings in response to us asking for them to pay for the 53 million streams that have not yet been paid on.\"\nIn an exclusive email to the Wall Street Journal , Spotify’s global head of communications and public policy, Jonathan Prince, claimed that neither one of the companies could provide enough data to back up their claims of unpaid royalties.\n\"Given that we don't have that information, we felt we had no choice but to temporarily take down their content until we can come to a resolution. Five months ago Audiam provided Spotify all the detailed songwriter information for the over 3,000 sound recordings they had not paid on.\"\nSpotify also claims that the Victory Records catalog is currently available in other countries.\nIn an exclusive letter sent to Alternative Press , Victory Records founder Tony Brummel reveals that they are, once again, trying to negotiate with Spotify. \"We are working with Spotify to bring the matter to closure.\"\n\"I am confident that Spotify, songwriters and other record labels and other music publishers will all benefit from this. The digital age of music brings with it many complicated issues. The goal is to get the music to the people in every way that we can that makes sense.\"\nThe removal of Victory Records' artists, and artists that Victory is not even the publisher for, comes hot on the heels of several musicians removing their own music from Spotify. Thom Yorke, Prince, and Taylor Swift are just a few of the musicians who have removed their music because of a lack of compensation for the artists, producers, and writers involved in the songs.", "external_links": ["http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6737385/publishers-songwriters-stream", "http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/spotify_pulls_thousands_of_victory_records_so", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/spotify-pulls-independent-music-companys-releases-amid-royalties-dispute-1445319692", "http://www.audiam.com/"], "published": "2015-10-22T00:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:47:33.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
