I'll preface this by disclosing two things: 1. I'm a DirecTV subscriber but I have never paid for the \"Sunday Ticket,\" which gives customers the ability to watch every NFL game thanks to DirecTV's exclusive agreement with the NFL.\n2. I haven't read any of the fine print of the NFL Ticket rules for 2015. So, if there's a disclaimer for this season, when the NFL has decided in its infinite wisdom to screw over Bills and Jaguars that don't live in Buffalo or Jacksonville, I'm not aware of it. (If you know of one, feel free to share).\nBut if I was a fan who is cheesed off about spending good money on the Sunday Ticket and being shut out of watching this game on TV because the NFL has, in its infinite wisdom, decided to use the Bills-Jags game at 9:30 a.m. Sunday in London as its guinea pig, I'd be calling DirecTV and asking for a Sunday Ticket refund. Here's my story on the uproar from local fans who didn't get the memo when the NFL announced in June that this game would only be streamed live on Yahoo!, so fans have to watch on their computers or iPads or Smart TVs. In this all-about-the-clicks world, the NFL needs to know!\nMemo to Roger Goodell: Do you really think the Bills and Jags have enough national appeal, on a Sunday morning, to pull a decent click number? Next time you might want to put Brady or Peyton in the click game.\n\"Good enough to suck our ticket and merchandise dollars, hold pre-season camp (here at St. John Fisher College), keep us in the blackout market for 40 years,\" one Bills fan told me for my story in Tuesday's print editions on this, \"but not good enough to have an away game on free broadcast TV or available on the DirecTV Sunday Ticket, which the public and supporting sports bars dump millions into each year just to make sure they get all the games.\"\nAll good points. Another fan told me he will not get on Yahoo! on Sunday to watch, his own \"solitary protest,\" of the NFL's decision to dip its toe into only streaming games. What does the future hold? Well, this could be first sign that even if you're sitting on your couch someday you won't be able to watch an NFL game for free (not that you are anyway with cable TV bills, right? At least network TV is still free).\nI fear the day of an a la carte option, in which you have to spend $1.99 or $10.99 or whatever, to watch the game you want to put on your TV or computer could happen. Heck, maybe you're like me. Between now and Sunday I plan to buy Google's ChromeCast or Apple TV or some device so I can put the Yahoo! stream on my television. Nothing in life, as they say, is free.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T21:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:59:19.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
