Photo Contributed Contributed Local Real Estate Cars For Sale \nDENNIS Locorriere is at a place in his life where he can have a bit of a laugh at himself. \nThe singer songwriter is best known as the former front man of '70s American rock band Dr Hook, but has also penned songs for Bob Dylan, Willie Nelson, Helen Reddy and Crystal Gayle. \n\"I've been around long enough to be a vintage act,\" he laughed over the phone from his home in the UK. \n\"But there's nothing you can do about it (ageing). If I had my pick of being an act at this point of life where I am now or an act who is still going 'Oh my God, is this going to work?' then I think I'd rather be here.\" \nLast year Locorriere returned to Australia for the first time in 15 years, playing a massive 26-date tour of the country. \nIt was important for him to return to Australia as a solo act, rather than focusing on his Dr Hook years. \n\"I thought if I bring a band and play the hits, all anybody will have learned about me is I'm 15 years older and I'm still playing the same songs,\" he said. \n\"I understand why people like nostalgia, even more now these days. It becomes the soundtrack of your life, but also there's this thing about being congratulated over and over for something you once did.\" \nAfter the group disbanded in 1985, Locorriere carved out a successful songwriting career in Nashville and even dabbled in acting, poetry and illustration. \nNow the 66-year-old is back in the country to indulge Dr Hook fans with a bit of nostalgia. \n\"I came back to Australia solo so people would go 'Oh that's Dennis' and now when I come back with this (show) they go 'That's Dennis and he's doing the Hook thing again'.\" \nHis Dr Hook Timeless Tour marks the release of a two-disc collection of the band's greatest hits. \n\"Universal Music asked me if I could put together 40 tracks for them,\" he said. \n\"I had to listen to virtually everything we'd recorded and I rediscovered what I liked about it. What I like about the music as a piece in general is we didn't record the same song over and over. We did funny stuff, rocky stuff, stuff that would break your heart, love songs, country music.\" \nThe Timeless Tour will feature songs from the greatest hits album such as The Cover of Rolling Stone and When You're In Love with A Beautiful Woman as well as a few of Locorriere's solo songs. \nThe Timeless World Tour tour will visit the Mackay Entertainment and Convention Centre on October 24. \nFor tickets visit www.mackaytix.com.au.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:55:02.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
