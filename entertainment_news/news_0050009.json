Streett, executive director of the Clinton Foundation.\nThe centerpiece of the exhibit is a young chestnut tree that was awarded to the Center by the Anne Frank Center USA’s “Sapling Project” in 2009. The sapling was taken from the white horse chestnut tree that stood outside Anne Frank’s Secret Annex when she and her family were in hiding from the Nazis during World War II.\n\"Anne Frank took great solace from the horse chestnut tree that grew outside the secret annex on the Prinsengracht in Amsterdam, where she, her family and four others were in hiding during World War II. To Anne, it represented life in the face of death, the freedom to blossom and prosper,\" Ronald Leopold, executive director of the Anne Frank House, said.\nThe Center’s installation consists of five framed, etched glass panels – arranged to evoke the feeling of being inside a room – surrounded by complementary natural landscaping. The two front panels feature Quote: s from Anne Frank and President Clinton. The three additional panels convey the complex history of human rights in Arkansas through descriptions of the Indian Removal Act of 1830, the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, and the Little Rock Central High School desegregation crisis of 1957. These panels will feature Quote: s from Chief Heckaton, hereditary chief of the Quapaw during Arkansas’s Indian Removal; George Takei, Japanese-American actor who was interned at the Rohwer Relocation Center in Desha County, Arkansas, in 1942; and Melba Patillo Beals, member of the Little Rock Nine.\nIn collaboration with the Clinton Foundation, Little Rock landscape architect Cinde Drilling and Ralph Appelbaum Associates, exhibit designer for both the Center and The National Holocaust Museum, assisted in the design of the exhibit. The installation has been made possible thanks to the support of the Ben J. Altheimer Charitable Foundation and other generous partners.\nThe Center’s sapling is currently housed in a local nursery where it is acclimating to Arkansas’s environment. And although it will be present during the ceremony, it will be returned to the nursery where it will be cared for until it has matured and can thrive in its new home, located on the grounds of the Park. A similar chestnut tree will be temporarily planted in its place until the Anne Frank tree can be permanently transplanted.\nAbout the William J. Clinton Presidential Center\nThe William J. Clinton Presidential Center and Park is a world-class educational and cultural venue offering a variety of special events, exhibitions, educational programs, and lectures throughout the year.

Her insights and courage continue to inspire students, educators and citizens more than 70 years after her diary was first published.\nThe Anne Frank Center USA Sapling Project is made possible, in part, by public funds from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, The Children’s Museum of Indianapolis, and KLM Royal Dutch airlines, the official airline of The Anne Frank Center USA.\nClick here for more information on The Sapling Project and The Anne Frank Center USA .\nVisit the Center on Facebook at http://www.facebook.com/AnneFrankCenterUSA , @AnneFrankCenter on Twitter, and @AnneFrankCenterUSA on Instagram.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13000057.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://annefrank.com/", "http://www.Facebook.com/ClintonCenter", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13000057.htm", "http://www.annefranktreeusa.com/", "https://www.clintonfoundation.org/clinton-presidential-center", "http://www.facebook.com/AnneFrankCenterUSA"], "published": "2015-10-02T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:15:01.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
