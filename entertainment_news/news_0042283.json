The director is one of the hardest working, most talented theater artists in the North Country. Ask the Artist Kristie Fuller – Director “The Yellow Boat” 1. How did you discover the play, “The Yellow Boat?” Have you seen a previous performance? While I was in Kentucky at an AATE conference, I discovered the script at a Resource Fair. As someone who's passionate about HIV/AIDS Education and Awareness, I fell in love with this play. I have never seen a production, but I read the play! 2. What made you select it for your fall show? I thought it was very important to tell this story and use it as an opportunity to educate the public about how HIV/AIDS has changed and why it is important to get tested! 3. What were some of the biggest challenges for you in directing this play? Creating the overall production concept was the biggest challenge. I wanted to tell this story in a different way from any other production that I researched. I wanted to bring out the amazing imagination of this young man. We attempted to do this through the use of aerial silks that are used in a variety of ways throughout the show. 4. What were the biggest challenges for the crew members and the cast? I think in the beginning it was the challenge of playing a variety of roles; creating physicality and vocal signatures for a wide variety of characters. 5. What do you hope the students involved take away form this project? I hope that the students have learned the importance of walking in someone else's shoes; reducing the stigma of HIV and AIDS. In addition, I want them to always seek the truth instead of fear and encourage that in everyone they can influence. 6. What do you hope the audience takes away from the experience of the play? In terms of the audience, I do want them to leave our performance with the same things I want from my students. In addition, I hope the experience educates them on how HIV/AIDS has changed since the 80's, and encourages them to reduce stigma and embrace differences in their community instead of fear. 7. Can you talk a bit about your commitment to selecting socially relevant plays that most high schools stay away from? I actually believe that using theatre is a powerful tool for making change, examining our personal beliefs and encouraging connection and collaboration. As a theatre artist, I feel it is my responsibility to bring powerful stories to life on the stage. One of my favorite quotes is by Willem Defoe: “Great theatre is about challenging how we think and encourage us to fantasize about a world we aspire to.” The Indian River Drama Club presents The Yellow Boat by David Saar on Friday, October 23, 2015 at 7:00pm and Saturday, October 24, 2015 at 2:00pm and 7:00pm at Indian River High School’s Theatre of the Performing Arts . The Yellow Boat is based on the true story of Benjamin Saar, who was born with hemophilia and died in 1987 at the age of 8 of AIDS-related complications. The play was written by Benjamin’s father, David Saar. Along with the joys and sorrows of a “normal” childhood, the play traces Benjamin’s short life as he and his family face the special challenges of hemophilia and contracting HIV through a blood transfusion in the 1980s. Though it sensitively explores the serious issues of AIDS in the 1980s, this is a play about the celebration of a child’s life and a tribute to all children. The story is told through Benjamin’s eyes and his artwork. Benjamin’s imagination transformed his physical and emotional pain into a glow of colors and shapes in his drawings and paintings that inspired all of those around him. It is about the power of imagination and art to transform our lives and make them full of color, energy, humor, and hope. Indian River’s production of The Yellow Boat is non-realistic. The audience will use their imagination to follow the symbolic filled story of Benjamin’s life. The drawings come to life in a three-dimensional dance, utilizing silks, ribbons, instruments, and even hula- hoops. The cast comprises of Sheldon Bush (Benjamin), Alyssa Sands (Mother), and Noah LaClair (Father). Aleisha Cooke, Amiere Bell, Hannah Bajakian, Bannon Montgomery, and Maria Miller portray multiple characters throughout the show, including young children, doctors, and teachers. The show’s understudy is Justin Nadal. Misty Rodriguez is the stage manager. Kristie Fuller is directing the piece with the assistance of Elaine Finley. Lindsay Myers designed the set, lights, and costumes. Each performance is ASL Interpreted for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Community. Autographed Broadway merchandise items have been donated for a silent auction to benefit Broadway Cares Equity Fights AIDS. ACR Health will be setting up a booth for each performance. Additionally, an HIV Consultant will be available to lead a talk back after the show. Tickets cost $5 each and can be purchased at the door or reserved by contacting Elaine Finley at 315-642-5521 or elainefinley@ircsd.org . About the Artist: Kristie L.
