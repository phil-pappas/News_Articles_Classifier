When Gulbahari walked the red carpet on the first night of Asiaâ€™s largest film festival, she showed the world more than the colorful traditional Afghan dress she was wearing. She showed the world the face of women in Afghanistan. For Afghan women, showing one's face in public, not to mention on a huge screen, is disliked by conservatives there, even as the fall of the hard-line Islamic Taliban regime allowed women to return to schools, workplaces and even to parliament. Many women still wear a burqa, the clothing that covers women from head to toe with a mesh panel over the face.
