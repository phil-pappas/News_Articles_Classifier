Vail Music Festival on Jan. 19. « » Related Media VAIL — Bravo! Vail Music Festival Board of Trustees chairman Dan Godec announced Thursday that Jennifer Teisinger has been appointed as the Festival’s next executive director. Founder and interim executive director John Giovando is preparing to step down Oct. 31. “We could not be more excited about Bravo!’s future,” Godec said. “After a nine-year career defined by bold leadership and artistic innovation with Sun Valley, Jennifer now brings these talents to the best classical Festival in the U.S. Coupled with peerless artistic direction led by Anne-Marie McDermott, Jennifer’s commitment to supporting creative excellence and her strong business acumen promise a great future for Bravo! Vail.” Past successes Teisinger begins her role at Bravo! Vail on Jan. 19 after leading the Sun Valley Summer Symphony in Sun Valley, Idaho, through a period of extraordinary artistic success — bringing world-renowned names from Joshua Bell to Renée Fleming to Itzhak Perlman to the Festival — which catalyzed unprecedented growth in both audience attendance and fundraising. Among other accomplishments, Teisinger and the board led the symphony through a $5 million capital fundraising campaign that surpassed goal by $2 million and supported the development of a new, world-class venue, the Sun Valley Pavilion. Prior to joining Sun Valley Summer Symphony, Teisinger served as executive director of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra (Washington), youth orchestra manager with the San Francisco Symphony and in numerous roles with the San Jose Symphony. “Jennifer joins the Festival after a truly unforgettable season led by John Giovando, and on behalf of both the board and staff, I’d like to thank him for his incredible work taking the Festival even further forward,” Godec said. “I’d also like to thank Jeanne Gustafson and our search committee for their hard work and vision.” McDermott said she looks forward to welcoming Teisinger to the Bravo! team and to forging ahead together to build upon past successes and create new opportunities for the future. “John Giovando’s inspired guidance and spirit will always be with us at Bravo!, and we will aspire to continue the bold and visionary leadership he brought to the Festival,” she said. “I am deeply honored and enthusiastic to be asked to lead Bravo! Vail,” Teisinger said. “As a premier classical music festival with the unique honor of hosting four internationally renowned orchestras, plus a dynamic chamber music series, Bravo! is known for its high artistic standards. Bravo! has a reputation for producing the very best in classical music performances, from the artistry on stage to the stunning mountain setting.” Giovando has ensured that the Festival is well positioned for growth with a solid financial footing, passionate patron support and a dedicated board and staff, she said. “It is my great pleasure to build upon his vision, and I look forward to meeting the many patrons and audience members who have made the Festival so successful,” Teisinger said. Looking forward Giovando will close out his role on Oct. 31, having taken the Festival through a 2015 season that surpassed all attendance, ticket sales and fundraising records. Giovando also steered the Festival through the development of a new international partnership with London’s celebrated Academy of St Martin in the Fields with music director Joshua Bell for the 2016 season. “I am truly delighted that Jennifer Teisinger will become the next executive director of the Bravo! festival and join its very talented and committed staff, together with its world-class artistic team under the solid direction of Anne-Marie McDermott,” Giovando said. “She will work well with staff leadership to continue its 2016 planning and funding efforts and move the Festival forward for many future seasons at the beautiful Gerald R. Ford Amphitheater and community area venues. “Jennifer has proven to be an excellent executive director at the Sun Valley Summer Symphony, thoroughly understanding board and donor relations, management and artistic development. Jennifer and her beautiful family love living in the mountains of a resort community and will be a great fit for Vail.” It has been an honor and pleasure to be of service to such a wonderful place as Vail and its surrounding community, Giovando said. “The vision of the Festival and of Vail will continue to expand with new leadership and love of place,” he said. “Thank you sincerely.” \n“It is my great pleasure to build upon his vision, and I look forward to meeting the many patrons and audience members who have made the festival so successful.” Jennifer TeisingerNew Bravo!
