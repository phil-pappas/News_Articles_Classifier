A species of shark which looks like a massive blobfish has been discovered off the coast of Britain for the first time in a decade.\nThe false catshark — which can reach up to three meters in length — was found by scientists conducting a deep sea survey.\nThe fish, which also has narrow eyes, a large mouth and a broad head with a short, rounded snout, was discovered by Marine Scotland off the coast of the remote island of St Kilda.\nAlso known as a sofa shark, it has large flaps of skin on the anterior rims of the nostrils.\nIts association with a sofa is result of its soft features which include large flabby muscles and an oily liver, which makes up 25 per cent of its total weight.\nIts large liver allows it to hover over the bottom of the ocean with little effort.\nThe slow-moving predator has tiny teeth and normally eats bony fishes like eels, squid and shrimp.\nMarine biologist Francis Neat was surprised to catch the shark during a survey on the West of Scotland.\nHe said “I was pretty surprised when it landed in our boat. We quickly measured and weighed it before sending it back into the water.\n“We hadn't seen one in 10 years. It's not unique to Scotland but is certainly interesting to look at.\n“It's a big and baggy looking creature. It looks a lot like a soft, discarded sofa when it's just lying there.”\nIt is only the second time in a decade that the species has been spotted in Scotland.\nAt the moment, there are 72 different types of shark living in Scottish waters.\nThe psuedotrakias microdon can live at depths as deep as 1,400 meters but was caught at 600 meters on the west coast of the country.\nIt weighed around 60 kilograms and was measured at two and a half meters.\nThe species are rarely encountered but have been spotted in locations around the world, including the western Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean.\nThey normally swim close to the sea floor and only occasionally come into shallower water over the continental shelf.\nA spokesman for the Scottish Shark Tagging program said the species was a welcome addition to their list.\n“We've never seen this type of shark in Scotland before and it's great to add it to our long list of species in Scotland,” he said.\n“Not too long ago we were told that there was only 32 different types of shark in Scottish waters but in the past year we've learned that there are actually 72 different species, many of which are in deep water.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:05:17.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
