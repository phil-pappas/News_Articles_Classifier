It's a night of love and of friendship and of fun.\"\nClothing ranged from beaded jackets, draped trousers and genie pants.\nAt the end of the runway portion of the presentation, the Backstreet Boys performed a medley of some of their hits.\nThe Balmain x H&M line is intended to be more affordable but that's depending on whom you ask, with some pieces priced at more than $500.\nView gallery Kendall Jenner participates in the Balmain x H&M Collection launch event at 23 Wall Street on Tuesda … The collection goes on sale Nov. 5.\n___\nFollow Alicia Rancilio at http://www.twitter.com/aliciar\n___\nOnline:\nhttp://www.hm.com/\nArts & Entertainment Fashion Kendall Jenner Gigi and Bella Hadid", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:05:28.358+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
