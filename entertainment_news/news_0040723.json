Copeland, who graduated from Teaneck High School in 1997, returns to the township on Tuesday for a show at Mexicali Live. \nEach track on the album has its own distinct message: homelessness (\"Cardboard Box\"), poverty (\"Lord, Help the Poor and Needy\") and regret (\"Crossbone Beach\"). Copeland's emotive vocals are by turns commanding, spiritual, sultry and playful. She said that she aims for a live feel in the recording studio. \"When I'm in the vocal booth I pretend that I'm onstage,\" Copeland said. \"You have to jump inside every song.\" \n\"Outskirts of Love\" contains a mix of original and cover songs. \"Devil's Hand\" is a track by Copeland's late father, Texas blues guitar great Johnny Copeland. \n\"I like the content of the song,\" she said. \"It's about when you mess with the devil, the devil wrecks your life like a hurricane. He has so many great songs. It was tough to decide which one to pick for the album.\" \nCopeland also lays down a fiery rendition of ZZ Top's \"Jesus Just Left Chicago\" â€” the band's frontman, Billy Gibbons, plays guitar on the track. \"After I moved to Chicago, I always felt it would be a cool song to do,\" Copeland said. \"I ran into Billy and he told me how he used to always go see my dad play in Texas. I was completely honored that he said yes to playing on the album.\" \nShe also imparts an inspiring gospel take on Creedence Clearwater Revival's \"Long As I Can See the Light\" and gives a nod to country on the original track, \"Drivin' Out of Nashville.\" \nCopeland said that blues, gospel, soul and country are one big musical family and added that she sees a parallel between music's separation into tightly-defined genres and divisions between cultural groups. \"We're all connected but we separate ourselves,\" Copeland said. \"Why, I have no idea.\" \nCopeland moved to Teaneck from Manhattan for her sophomore year of high school and lived in the town through her late teens. While she was surrounded by blues music growing up and sang at an early age, Copeland did not immediately aspire to follow the path of her famous father. \n\"I didn't think of singing as a career until I was around 16,\" Copeland said. \"I got a calling to sing and it hit me like a ton of bricks. I'm not exactly sure if there was a specific thing that inspired it, but when you find your calling you follow it.\" \nCopeland's first touring experience came when she opened for her ailing father as a teenager shortly before his death in 1997. At the time, Johnny Copeland told his daughter that he needed her to help care for him on the road. But Copeland said that her father really wanted to make sure she got a start in the blues scene before he died. \n\"Really he was doing it all for me,\" she said. \"He went out of his way to get me that exposure.\" Copeland soon made a name for herself, based on her talent more than her pedigree. She received rave reviews from critics and musicians after nearly every show. \nCopeland released her first album, \"Turn the Heat Up,\" at age 18 in 1998. Follow-up disc, \"Wicked\" (2000), won three Blues Music awards and was nominated for a Grammy award for best blues album. Her 2012 effort, \"33?,\" also earned a Grammy nomination. \"Outskirts of Love\" is Copeland's eighth album.
