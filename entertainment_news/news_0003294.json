The Wanted star Jay, 25, must be feeling the pressure after disappointing the judges last week, but he looked relaxed in new pictures from behind the scenes. \n© Twitter / @JayMcGuiness Sharing a photo with his 904,000 Twitter followers, Jay joked: \"Dance monkeys dance! @AlionaVilani It's Ali & Jay, with the Paso Doble, on #DanceSelfieDay.\"In the snap, gorgeous Aliona is pout-tastic, while Jay looks bemused in a red and black checked shirt. Here's @AlionaVilani & I meeting students from my school All Saints, you were awesome.

Now tuck your shirts in...\" \n© WENN \n© WENN Just hours before Saturday's live shows, Jay was seen leaving a nearby hotel with some of the other professional dancers including Janette Manara, and fellow amateurs Kellie Bright and Georgia May Foote - all current favourites.Last week, Jay was gutted when his quickstep got his lowest score from the judges.He dropped from a score of 37 for his much-praised jive the previous week to just 25 for a quickstep that was riddled with errors. \n© BBC / Guy Levy \nAliona and Jay performed a Waltz on Strictly On Strictly: It Takes Two , Jay said: \"Basically every mistake that I would naturally make in the learning process, I decided to do them all together.\"Jay is now hoping that his paso doble on Saturday night (24 October) will put him back at the top of the leaderboard, but he admitted that it isn't an easy dance.He said: \"It's hard and it's the most physically demanding of all the dances that we've done, or maybe just the routine is. But I hurt physically more than I've hurt on any other one.\" Strictly Come Dancing continues on Saturday at 6.35pm on BBC One.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T19:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:08:59.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
