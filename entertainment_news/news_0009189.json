I feel proud to be in a family that has so many people breaking ground for the generations to come. \n\"I feel proud that ... I could be next to a wave of thought of 'this is who I am'. And that is all I'm about. To let your life be controlled by public opinion would be like asking to sit in traffic for the rest of your life. \n\"Meaning like, you want to turn this way but there's a car right here that says [you can't do that]. You want to go a bit faster but there's a car right in front of you.\" \nHowever, the father-of-one made a slip up during the interview with SHOWstudio and accidentally referred to Caitlyn as Bruce, which is what she was known as before her transition. \nTelling a story about the former athlete, he said: \"And Bruce just got off the exit sign and drove as fast as he wanted to. \n\"Oh I'm sorry it's disrespectful to use that name. I'm still getting acquainted with what's politically correct and what's not politically correct. \n\"It's new, it's modern - you know what I mean? This is like Roman times bro, it's like this time we have on Earth, this 100 years, it's really the beginning of the future. \n\"We've finally tapped into the type of technology and acceptance and thought that we need to ... And look at the new Pope! Like, it's a bunch of dope mother***ers out here that I like. Just pushing towards the future.\" bang showbiz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:14:24.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
