Pottermore released the very first look at the new art for the play based on a new story from J.K. Rowling and it's very ​interesting.\n​On Thursday afternoon, Pottermore tweeted a look at the poster for \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child Parts I & II.\"\nThe official artwork for Harry Potter and the #CursedChild has been revealed: https://t.co/ZN8XJfaytj pic.twitter.com/vhJoGJRJfm\n— Pottermore (@pottermore) October 22, 2015\nMore From Cosmopolitan The artwork has the approval of the author, who seemed to really like it on Twitter.\nAnd I love it! https://t.co/kIW48O4IQ2\n— J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) October 22, 2015\nOn first glimpse, it doesn't really reveal much. But with a closer look at the artwork, you can see a small child in a bird's nest. My spine is tingling already. Rowling has stated firmly that the play is not a prequel , leaving some to speculate the film is a sequel involving Harry and his son Albus. Others think the \"cursed child\" could be Remus, Voldemort, Snape, Dumbledore, or—I don't know, the kid from this cake video (probably a longshot).\nAccording to Pottermore, the play will debut on London's West End in the summer of 2016. I need a patience and/or time-travelling spell, ASAP. ​\n​Follow Rebecca on Instagram .", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/CursedChild?src=hash", "https://t.co/vhJoGJRJfm", "https://www.pottermore.com/news/cursed-child-artwork-revealed", "https://t.co/ZN8XJfaytj", "https://t.co/kIW48O4IQ2", "https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/657271913706819585", "https://instagram.com/rebeccaburtrose/", "https://twitter.com/pottermore/status/657271399367757826", "http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Harry-Potters-Legacy-Lives-On-West-Ends-CURSED-CHILD-Is-a-Sequel-Not-a-Prequel-20151022"], "published": "2015-10-23T08:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:36:18.382+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
