I've enjoyed it. I think it's a little bit harder to allow myself to be pregnant because obviously I've got the three others that I'm looking after and they don't cut me a lot of slack. I'm not allowed to sit down that much.'' \nThe 'Murder On The Dancefloor' hitmaker already has sons Sonny, 11, Kit, six, and Ray, three, with her husband Richard Jones , and although they are keeping her hands full she's thrilled they are there because it means the newborn will have a loving welcome. \nShe said: ''But we're all really excited and I think it's really nice having a baby and knowing that there's all these people waiting to meet it.'' \nAnd her new arrival couldn't have come at a better time as she's just had the ''best year'' of her career, following the release of her fifth studio album 'Wanderlust' last year. \nShe added: ''Last year I brought out my first album on my own label and it was my most successful since my first album and it was the best feeling ever. I had the best year of my career. There are so many benefits to being independent and getting older and all of those things, I embrace all of it.''
