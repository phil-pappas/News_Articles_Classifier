But it's critical that their judges are well qualified and that their criteria for reviewing and rewarding toys are relevant, well thought out, and designed to support play.\nThe American Specialty Toy Association (ASTRA), recognized nationwide for its prestigious annual awards program, today announced its 2015 Best Toy for Kids Awards. Winners in 14 distinct categories are chosen by specialty store retailers – more than 800 men and women who understand the value of play and, day in and day out, have hands-on experience with how kids play.\n\"The ASTRA Best Toys for Kids Award experts base their choices on what the child does with the toy, not what the toy does,\" said Kimberly Mosley , ASTRA president. \"They know what kids love – as well as what they'll play with just once then toss to the sidelines. Because they recognize a quality play experience when they see it, these toy experts can offer helpful and meaningful recommendations on brands both large and small.\"\nAs a result, the annual Best Toys for Kids Award makes it easier for moms, dads and other gift-givers to make smart buying decisions for their kids.\nThe Best Toys for Kids Award honors the new and improved toys that promote open-ended or creative play, incorporate innovative design features and maintain exceptional safety standards.
