Dwight Yoakam/Lanco WHERE: Orpheum Theater , New Orleans TICKETS: $45-$178 \nLast week, Yoakam found spending a few rare days at home more challenging than anything he usually encounters during his travels. \n“Which is why I get ambushed by everything that’s been waiting for me for the past six months,” the Kentucky native said from southern California. “Your life catches up to you and starts beating you with a baseball bat.” \nBut Yoakam and his boys are right back on the road this week. Their fall itinerary includes two weekends at the Austin City Limits Music Festival and Saturday night at the newly reopened Orpheum Theater in New Orleans. \n“We were on the Gulf Coast the night before Katrina hit,” Yoakam said. “Driving out of Biloxi, I remember looking at those beautiful antebellum mansions along the main street.” \nAlso that night, when Yoakam and his band flew out to do a show in Tunica, they watched the windows at Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport being boarded up. \n“It’s great to be a small part of something now, so many years removed from that moment, with the Orpheum’s reopening,” he said. \nPlaying songs from this year’s “Second Hand Heart” album has been fun, Yoakam said. Some nights, he’ll do as many of five or six songs, other nights just two or three. That’s because Yoakam always tries to cover the breadth and width of his career. Those 31 years of recordings have sold more than 25 million copies worldwide. \n“When I go see The Rolling Stones, I want to hear ‘Satisfaction,’” he said. “I want to hear ‘Let It Bleed.’ When Johnny Cash came to town, I wanted to hear ‘Walk the Line.’” \nLike others who grew up to make music a profession, Yoakam was first a fan. Early on, he heard his father’s Cash recordings for Sun Records in Memphis. Then he heard Buck Owens, a leader of West Coast country, on the radio. \n“Buck was on the radio singing ‘I’ve — got — a — tiger by the tail.’ That and ‘Together Again.’ Those things were crossover hits playing on AM car radio,” he said. “By the time I was 8, I had a transistor radio. I heard Buck, Roger Miller. My transistor had a little earpiece. A single earpiece. It was mono. I’d lay there at night, listening, when I was supposed to be asleep.” \nOwens and Cash later became Yoakam’s friends. \n“Buck and I were very close, from ’86 through 2006, when he passed,” Yoakam said. “John was complimentary about what I did. He understood it. I felt an affinity to Johnny in that way, perhaps even more so than to Buck. Because I was straddling that fence like Johnny Cash. He wasn’t rock ’n’ roll or rockabilly, exclusively. He wasn’t country, exclusively. He had his own space.” \nFor 30 years, Yoakam, too, has his own place in music. Cash, Owens, Roy Orbison, Roger Miller and others who didn’t toe the Nashville sound line would approve.
