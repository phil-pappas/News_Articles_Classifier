This unique game is favorite among quite a lot of people. You will even be surprised to know it is one of the steady revenue earners in many countries. However, now you might start pondering that does this Gambling Data suggest that a major sliver of the world has become a compulsive gambler. Perhaps, some of the commonly circulated myths about gambling and gamblers will give a better solution your queries regarding compulsive gambling. Start reading. Myth One: If you gamble every day, you will become a compulsive gamblerThis is a complete misconception because it has been found that a number of compulsive gamblers are there who do not gamble every day. Some gamblers do not gamble even trice a week, but are still compulsive in nature. Actually, the frequency with which you play this game has no connection the vulnerability of your addiction to it. Myth Two: Gambling does not become addiction unless you lose in a gameFirst of all let us tell you that this statement is a partial myth. Actually, when you lose in a game it develops an inherent inclination in you if you bet for a second time then you might bring back your lost fortune. This feeling develops into a vicious circle and encourages you to gamble over and over again. While this is one form of compulsiveness towards the game, you cannot rule out the fact that a person can gamble repeatedly even after series of wins. Basically, this is another form of compulsive gambling where the win makes gamblers gain money. As a result, the temptation makes them gamble more and more in the hope that they will make greater fortune. Myth Three: You become a compulsive gambler only when you are financially brokeThis is a mythical statement. This is because addiction to gambling has nothing to do with the financial status of a person. It has been found that many people are there who do not gamble even when they suffer from poverty. On the other hand, few others are there who are financially sound. These gamblers play this game just to satisfy their obsession about it. Likewise, even if the financial prerequisites of a gambler are satisfied, the person will not stop gambling. Cases like these suggest that such people have a fixation or a love interest for the game which makes them addicted to it. Myth Four: Internet gambling does not make you addicted as there is no money involved in itThis is again a allegorical statement. Actually, money is not the only factor that makes gambling an addiction. The sense of accomplishment that a gambler experiences after winning a game is also an equally significant driving factor. Thus, it hardly matters whether a gambling game has monetary rewards or not. Actually, it is the passion that makes people compulsive. Hence, internet based gambling has the same appeal for an avid gambler as that of any casino based gambling game.GBGC is a leading gambling consultancy in UK, provides Gambling Data , Gambling Statistics, Internet Gambling and many more related to gambling About the Author", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T10:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:33:26.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
