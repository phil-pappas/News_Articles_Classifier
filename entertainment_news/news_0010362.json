Wearing form-fitting red dress, she gushed over her sexy photos that she was seeing for the first time.\nArci laughingly revealed she found the shoot quite challenging. “This is my first time to wear a bikini for a photo shoot! Another weakness is that I don’t know how to pose!” she says.\nIn an exclusive interview with Bulletin Entertainment, she recalled feeling “stiff and boyish” in taking a sensuality workshop for “Pasion de Amor.” However, for her pictorial, she shares, “Enjoy ako sa part na nagba-basketball ako wearing heels. Everyone was cautioning na baka madulas ako, but it was fun. Jay Tablante, the photographer, really helped me a lot.”\nChange is good\nGinebra San Miguel, Inc. (GSMI) launched its first calendar in 1988. Arci joins an illustrious group of calendar girls composed of former beauty queens Anjanette Abayari (1994), Alma Concepcion (1995) and Michelle Aldana (1998); former movie stars and TV personalities Janna Victoria (1999), Patricia Javier (2000), singer Geneva Cruz (2001), Rica Peralejo (2002), Aubrey Miles (2003), Belinda Bright and Maricar De Mesa (2004). Her teleserye co-star Ellen Adarna, last year’s endorser, was on hand to turn over the title.\nArci said the list helped her convince her parents to allow her to take on the project.\n“I think I already opened the doors for being more daring, starting with ‘Pasion de Amor.’ They all know that I am a very conservative actress and I grew up in a Christian atmosphere. My parents are really strict.”\nWhile she only had a few days to physically prepare for the shoot, her heart and mind were all set. “When I do something like this, I am physically, spiritually and mentally ready. I don’t want to do something half-baked. Hinanda ko talaga ang sarili ko. Plus, I believe that change is good. As I start doing daring roles, I always tell them I have my limitations and maybe we can adjust and compromise. Feeling ko naman kaya ko. Matanda na ako,” she jokes.\nFor her physical preparations, Arci regularly went to the gym and got on the treadmill.\n“I also did abs workout. For diet, pinilit ko talaga. Hirap ako mag-diet kasi matakaw ako at saka mahilig talaga ako sa pizza, so in moderation lahat. I even tried juicing pero hindi ko kaya, so kumain pa din ako.”\nGanado sa buhay\nGSMI Vice President and Marketing Manager Nelson Elises said Arci fits into their “Ganado sa Buhay” campaign launched last year. It celebrates the Filipino who diligently works hard to provide his family a better future.\n“She embodies the brand character – strong, versatile and resilient. She is a complete package. She’s got the beauty and the brains. She is multi-faceted. She’s a singer, an actress and a model. Truly, ‘ganado sa buhay’ and definitely one of the country’s most talented and hottest up-and-coming artists,” he says.\nAsked what makes her ganado in life, Arci answers, “’Yung mga inspirasyon ko sa buhay. That is what drives me – my family, my passion for acting, music and art, and having time to spend with my family and my pets. Unstoppable ako – kapag may gusto ako, walang makakapigil sa akin… Ang dami kong gustong gawin, ang dami kong gustong subukan sa buhay ko.”\nShe sees her campaign as a way to be a role model for the modern Filipina. “It doesn’t mean drinking excessively. It’s about being brave enough to face anything that comes your way,” she points out.\nShe reveals being a social drinker, mostly during gigs featuring her band Philia, for which she is vocalist. Following nights out, her cure for a hangover is indulging in french fries then hitting the treadmill to sweat it out. “I also rehydrate with juice and water,” she adds.\nAs calendar girl, Arci will grace the Ginuman Festivals to be held in key spots all over the country. The limited edition calendars that come with a set of “Ganado” coupons for discounts or freebies premium merchandise will be available in participating outlets via a purchase of two bottles of Ginebra San Miguel Bilog, Angelito, Frasquito or one bottle of Frasco.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:51:58.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
