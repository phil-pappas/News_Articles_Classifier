(Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)[/caption] Like last week, there are now seven new titles in the top ten of the Billboard 200, with only a few of the biggest albums managing to stay in the upper reaches of the chart.Leading the way is rapper Fetty Wap, who has had an amazing breakout year. He first appeared on the scene with the infectious “Trap Queen”, which made it all the way to number two on the Hot 100. After that, he sent two more singles—“679 (ft. Remy Boyz)” and “My Way (ft. Monty)”—to the top ten as well (and there was a fourth top 40 hit in there too). The self-titled set begins with 129,000 equivalent units moved, of which only 75,000 are actual sales, which means that Fetty Wap was a particularly popular title on streaming services this past week.Fetty Wap dethrones last frame’s number one album, which this week slips to number two. Drake and Future’s joint mixtape/album What A Time To Be Alive started strong last week with 375,000 copies, and this time around the numbers are still healthy, as it shifted another 107,000 copies. Despite not being a proper “album”, but rather a mixtape (though Drake seems to be blurring the lines between what the two are this year), the rapper has seen eight of the eleven songs from the project hit the Hot 100, where he recently placed his 100th entry .At number three is Eagles rocker Don Henley with his latest solo record, Cass County . The album is his fifth apart from the legendary rock group he was a part of, and it’s his highest-charting yet.Behind Henley is another respected musician who has been in the industry for decades: Mr. George Strait. The country star’s new album, Cold Beer Conversation , begins at number four with a respectable 86,000 units shifted. The album is Strait’s 28th studio LP, and his 20th to hit the top ten (including five number ones). As Billboard points out , this week sees Strait furthering his lead as the country act with the most top ten albums.At number five is The Weeknd, whose third album Beauty Behind The Madness is still going strong after a month thanks to multiple hit singles. Another country artist, Thomas Rhett, debuts at number six with his new album Tangled Up . The record matches his previous LP’s peak position, though his latest has started with more than twice as many copies as his first album (76,000 versus 36,000).Taylor Swift’s 1989 is, unsurprisingly, still in the top ten (at number seven this week), and it doesn’t look like it’s going anywhere anytime soon. The country-turned-pop singer is still promoting the record, and its fifth single, “Wildest Dreams” has just become a top ten hit . Almost one year since it was released, the album is still moving tens of thousands of copies. This past week, it shifted 41,000.Scottish alt-pop band Chvrches make their debut in the top ten with their second record, Every Open Eye , which starts out at number eight thanks to 38,000 units moved. Immediately behind them is another act that was able to translate a lot of buzz from their first album into a top tier start for their second. British dance production duo Disclosure’s new set Carcaral is new at number nine. The set, which features collaborations with the likes of Sam Smith , Lorde, The Weeknd, and Miguel, is just 3,000 behind Chvrches.The last entry this week is by Jack White’s side project The Dead Weather. The rock group’s newest album, Dodge and Burn , begins at number ten, having moved 33,000 units (almost all of which are sales). It is the third album and the third top ten for the group, which is just one of White’s bands. Including his work with The White Stripes, The Dead Weather, The Raconteurs, and under his own name, White has now collected ten top tens.[gallery2012]", "external_links": ["https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/caracal/id1001769354", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/dodge-and-burn/id1029604013", "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6715445/fetty-wap-debuts-at-no-1-on-billboard-200-albums-chart", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/every-open-eye/id1018532737", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/tangled-up/id1033353325", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/cass-county-deluxe/id1018514030", "http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/487192656/640x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/fetty-wap-deluxe/id1039458694", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/cold-beer-conversation/id1041861898"], "published": "2015-10-05T20:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:31:02.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
