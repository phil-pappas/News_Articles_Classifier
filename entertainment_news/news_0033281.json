You had to pay close attention to keep up.\nBut Quenneville had kept his defensive pairings more or less the same in an effort to find chemistry for a unit that was incorporating three new full-time contributors.\nThe surgery Duncan Keith had to replace a torn meniscus in his right knee blew up that chemistry and requires Quenneville to try new formulas to bridge the four to six weeks Keith will be out.\n\"Some guys are going to get to play a lot more than they (ever) have,\" Quenneville said. \"It's going to be a good test for them and it's going to be making them better as we go along. But we don't want to change their style of play and how they play.\"\nKeith's injury means Niklas Hjalmarsson and Brent Seabrook will be the glue expected to bind a unit that includes veteran Trevor Daley, who still is adjusting to the team's system, David Rundblad, who was a scratch the last five games, and the inexperienced Trevor van Riemsdyk and Viktor Svedberg.\nThe new pairings (from left to right) at Wednesday's practice were Svedberg-Seabrook, Hjalmarsson-van Riemsdyk and Daley-Rundblad. Keith officially was placed on long-term injured reserve, but Quenneville said not to expect the Hawks to recall anyone from Rockford for Thursday's game against the Panthers.\nSeabrook said there is a natural adjustment to playing with a new defensive partner, but the Hawks defensemen can't afford to waste much time finding a rhythm together.\n\"It takes time, but at this level you should be able to figure it out,\" Seabrook said. \"Being here for so long in the same kind of system, you're pretty used to it. The new guys coming in on the back end are doing a good job of picking it up. â€¦ Losing Dunc, it's going to be a huge hit but guys have to step up.\"\nDaley said his comfort level with the system has been growing and he senses that's the same for his fellow defensemen.\n\"The good thing about here is they preach the same stuff every single day, so it makes it easy,\" Daley said. \"You go to sleep thinking about it every night.\"\nOutside of increased ice time, Quenneville is trying not to add too much to any player's responsibilities. When Patrick Kane went down because of a broken clavicle last February, the Hawks tightened up on the defensive end and strung together enough points during the regular season to make the playoffs.\nWith Keith out, Quenneville said adapting to his absence is not as clear cut, but he hinted the less defense the Hawks have to play, the better.\n\"We want to make sure we're playing as much offense as we can because we don't have to check and make them worry about their own end,'' Quenneville said. \"With Kaner you miss a big chunk of your offense. With Duncs it's almost like you miss both parts of your game.\"\nNow those left on the blue line will have to pick up the slack as best they can.\nchine@tribpub.com\nTwitter @ChristopherHine\nPrivacy Policy Chicago Blackhawks", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56281649/turbine/ct-duncan-keith-plan-blackhawks-spt-1022-20151021"], "published": "2015-10-22T01:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:41:10.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
