The whole community is standing by to help where we can.”\nThe four-engine C-130J Hercules crashed shortly after midnight Thursday at Jalalabad air field, killing six Air Force crew members and five civilian contractors who were the flight’s only passengers, Air Force officials announced soon after the tragedy.\nThere are about 1,000 coalition forces in eastern Afghanistan, including U.S. and Polish troops, according to NATO. There are up to 35,000 civilian contractors throughout the war-torn nation.\nRuiz was a Marine Corps veteran who leaves behind a wife and three young children, Mann said. The two men had never met, though both live in the same area of Menifee.\nThe Fresno Bee reported that Ruiz was 29 and is survived by his wife, high school sweetheart Lorelyn, and their three children, two girls, ages 5 and 1, and a 3-year-old son.\n“He had a ton of leadership ability, even as a high school kid,” said Rodney Brumit, principal of Lemoore High, where Ruiz graduated in 2004. Lemoore is in the Central Valley, south of Fresno.\nThe cause of the crash remains under investigation.\nThe C-130J is the newest model of the Vietnam-era Hercules transport.\nThe plane hit a ground object as it was ascending, then crashed into a guard tower at the end of the airfield, the Stars and Stripes newspaper reported.\nThe Taliban claimed they shot down the plane. But the Air Force has said it doesn’t appear that enemy fire was involved.\nIt’s unclear when Ruiz’s remains will return to Menifee or where services will be held.\n“We have had tragedies (involving) other service members in Menifee, and the city ... will be standing by to support the family in any way we can,” said Navy veteran-turned-mayor Mann. “I have lost men under my command, and it’s always tough.”\nLewis Griswold, of the Freno Bee, and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "external_links": ["http://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/article37908675.html"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T08:17:05.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
