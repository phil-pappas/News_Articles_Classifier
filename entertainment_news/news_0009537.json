The protagonist, portrayed here as a middle-age man by Mathieu Almaric, guided the story of an earlier Desplechin film, “My Sex Life or … How I Got Into an Argument. In “My Golden Days” the authorial stand-in is played as a yearning, restless younger man by Quentin Dolmaire; Lou Roy-Lecollinet takes the role of his first love, Esther, young Paul’s first taste of serious complication. In French with English subtitles. \n5:30 p.m. Monday, AMC River East 21, 322 E.
