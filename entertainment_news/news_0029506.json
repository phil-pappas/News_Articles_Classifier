I had this lunch with her and after 15 minutes she said, ‘What film do you want to make?’ And I talked about it and after 15 minutes she went, ‘I want to do it!’ And I was so relieved.” \nThe movie, which opens in Toronto Friday before a wider Canadian release throughout the fall, stars Mulligan as working-class London laundry worker who is also a married mother of one. \nHer character Maud finds her inner feminist, risking her professional and personal life in the process, when she joins an activist-doctor (Helena Bonham Carter) in the suffragette movement led by real-life leader Emmeline Pankhurst (Meryl Streep in a very small role). \n“Having Helena Bonham Carter was interesting,” said Gavron. “She also had this incredible history, she’s the great-granddaughter of Herb Asquith, who was the prime minister at the time and the chief antagonist so there she was all up for having this, she talked about it as this posthumous conversation with her own great-grandfather.” \nAs for having multiple-Oscar winner Streep in only one major scene, Gavron said: “We weren’t telling her story, we were telling the story of the working women.” \nAdded Morgan: “Ultimately, what I think has been wonderful about Meryl is that she’s an incredible advocate for women in the industry, she’s been such an incredible force to have behind this film ... It was great but I don’t think we ever wanted to distort what we had written.” \nStill, Streep came under fire by some for wearing a T-shirt that said, “I’d rather be a rebel than a slave,” which is a direct Pankhurst quote, on the cover of Time Out London. \n“We’re aware around the sensitivities around the subject, particularly in the U.S.,” said Gavron. “The intention of the film is to talk about inequality, wherever, whenever, for all women of all backgrounds and that’s what we hope – there’s a positive discourse around that.” \nAs eventually advocated by Pankhurst, the suffragettes resorted to throwing stones through storefront windows, setting fires and demonstrating, which often led to clashes with police during which they were beaten, arrested and force-fed in prison due to hunger strikes. \n“I don’t think we pulled back (on the brutality),” said Gavron. “Some people think that we went too far. We depicted what we read.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T20:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:10:35.826+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
