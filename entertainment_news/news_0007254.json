Young adult novels have not only created a feverish fan base of readers in recent years — but also a surge in new audiences going to the movies.\nThe new wave of young adult novels being adapted for the silver screen seems to have started when J.K. Rowling’s 1997 book, “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone,” was made into a blockbuster film.\nThe book series made the author one of the wealthiest women in the world, but also made the main stars some of the most known in Hollywood. The franchise even spawned its own theme park at Universal Studios — The Wizarding World of Harry Potter.\nIts success could only be rivaled by the “Twilight” series — the film adaptations grossed over $390 million worldwide.\nBut some best-selling young adult novels, such as “The Giver” and “I am Number Four,” did not attract the same attention when made into a film.\nHere are some young adult novels that turned into box office triumphs or failures:\n“Twilight”\nSMPSP Stephenie Meyer's \"Twilight\" book series amassed hordes of fans and became a worldwide literary and film phenomenon. In 2005, Stephenie Meyer ’s published the first novel in the “Twilight” series.\nThe following books — including “New Moon,” “Eclipse” and “Breaking Dawn” — were just as successful with sales as the first.\nOver 100 million copies of the “Twilight” novels have been reportedly sold around the world.\nTo capitalize on the success of her books, Meyer agreed to have them adapted to films.\nMaking Hollywood stars out of actors Robert Pattinson, Kristen Stewart, Anna Kendrick and many others — the “Twilight” film franchise has gone down as one of the most popular in young adult literature and film history.\n“The Hunger Games”\nLionsgate Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence shines in \"The Hunger Games\" movies. Following in the footsteps of “Twilight”, the dystopic world of “The Hunger Games” catapulted the careers of movie stars Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth.\nWith a love triangle between characters Katniss Everdeen, Peeta Mellark and Gale Hawthorne in a post-apocalyptic world — where youth literally battle to the death — the fan-worshiped “Hunger Games” film gave Suzanne Collins’ 2008 published novel legions of new reading disciples.\nA Dubai-based “Hunger Games” theme park is in the works, set to open for the public in 2016.\n“Divergent”\nAndrew Cooper/Lionsgate Jeanine (Kate Winslet, left) and Tris (Shailene Woodley, right) are sworn enemies in \"Divergent\" and \"Insurgent.\" “Divergent” was author Veronica Roth’s first novel and is a part of the “Divergent” book trilogy — which includes the books “Divergent,” “Insurgent” and “Allegiant.”\nFeaturing another post-apocalyptic world — not quite like the one in “The Hunger Games” — characters Tris and Four navigate their growing romantic feelings for one another in a society built on personality types.\n“ Divergent ” and “ Insurgent ” were turned into films, released in 2014 and 2015.\nWith a hip cast of young up-and-comers such as Shailene Woodley, Theo James, Ansel Elgort and Miles Teller — amongst more established faces — ticket sales from “Divergent” surpassed its budget of $85 million, making close to $290 million worldwide .\n“The Maze Runner”\nPublished in 2010, James Dashner’s “ The Maze Runner ” seemed a perfect fit for readers who just could not get enough of young adults in peril in a world ruined by adults.\nThe New York Times Best-selling science-fiction series spotlights Thomas — a young man who wakes up with no idea of his identity or past memories, except for his name.\nFilm producers of “The Maze Runner” have helped to make Dashner’s book series a visual success in movie theaters and for its literar y fans.\nStarring \"Teen Wolf\" actor Dylan O’Brien and British actress Kaya Scodelario, “The Maze Runner” ran away with nearly $345 million in gross box office sales worldwide.\nBen Rothstein/AP \"The Maze Runner\" stars up-and-coming actor, Dylan O'Brien, who also stars in the MTV hit supernatural show, \"Teen Wolf.\" James Bridges Stars of \"The Fault in Our Stars\" Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort play cancer-afflicted lovers in the movie. John Bramley/Everett Collection / Everett Col \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\" is a banned book in various cities. Laurie Sparham/THE WEINSTEIN COMPANY Star of \"Vampire Academy,\" Zoey Deutch, is the daughter of actress Lea Thompson, who starred in movies of the \"Back to the Future\" film franchise. Previous Next Enlarge “The Fault in Our Stars”\nYouTube star and young adult fiction author John Green has fashioned an impressive career for himself as an expert in sappy, tear-jerking teen love stories.\nHis coming-of-age books, such as “Will Grayson, Will Grayson,” “Looking for Alaska” and “Paper Towns” are all favorites of young readers around the globe.\nHowever, the movie adaptation to his book — “The Fault in Our Stars” — solidified his status as a Hollywood power player, landing him a cushy film production deal .\nGreen's educational YouTube videos also average thousands of viewers, showing added proof of Green’s importance as a thinker and author.\n“The Perks of Being A Wallflower”\nAudiences and critics lauded “The Perks of Being a Wallflower,” which was based on author Stephen Chbosky’s book.\nBanned in several cities for its raw depiction of teenage sex, drug use, incest, abuse and homosexuality, the film still made it to movie theaters with a set fanbase.\nThe movie — starring actors Emma Watson (“Harry Potter” series) and Logan Lerman (“Percy Jackson” series) — became a commercial success as it appeared to capture a true portrait of teenage angst.\n“Vampire Academy”\nThe paranormal romance book — “Vampire Academy”— was stretched into a six-part USA Today and New York Times best-selling series .\nHowever, there will never be a sequel to the 2014 “Vampire Academy” movie.\nEven with producer Harvey Weinstein and “Mean Girls” director Mark Waters behind the film, it still pulled in paltry numbers during its opening weekend , having gained just close to $4 million .\nUltimately, “Vampire Academy” could not match the success of “Twilight,” or its production budget of $30 million .\n“Beautiful Creatures”\nJohn Bramley \"Beautiful Creatures\" was directed by Richard LaGravenese, who also wrote the Angelina Jolie directed movie, \"Unbroken.\" In another tragic love story about a supernatural being who meets a ordinary human, “Beautiful Creatures” barely scraped by in movie theaters.\nOn a worldwide scale, the movie made up to $60 million — matching the film’s budget .\nBreaking even, the “Beautiful Creatures” film adaptation was just not as profitable as the books, which has sold more than 3.5 million copies since 2013.\n“The Host”\nAlan Markfield/AP \"The Host,\" did not do as well at the box office as another Stephenie Meyer inspired film, \"Twilight.\" Rafy \"The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones\" features actress Lily Collins, who is the daughter of lead singer and drummer of the famed rock band, Genesis. \"I Am Number Four\" is the first book within author Pittacus Lore's \"Lorien Legacies\" series. The Weinstein Company Famous thespians Jeff Bridges, Katie Holmes and Meryl Streep star in \"The Giver.\" Previous Next Enlarge From the mind of “Twilight” creator Stephenie Meyer, “ The Host ” was poised to be another breakout hit from the ambitious author.\nThe romance book’s tale about people’s bodies becoming a host for aliens did not perform nearly as well in theaters as “Twilight” did — with some critics stating that it’s “ cloaked in yawningly familiar teen-romance terms ” and “ virtually mindless .”\n“The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones”\nCassandra Clare’s “Mortal Instruments” books are so well-received, that they will have a third life as the new, upcoming MTV television series — “ Shadowhunters .”\nIts second life, as the movie “The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,” saw a swift, painful death on the silver screen.\nMovie critics decimated the science fantasy film, calling it “overly long,” “cringe-worthy in its cheesiness” and “ completely forgettable .”", "external_links": ["http://www.richellemead.com/bio/bio.htm", "http://screenrant.com/twilight-stephenie-meyer-controversy-discussion/", "http://www.flickeringmyth.com/2014/07/dvd-review-vampire-academy-2014.html", "http://www.marshall.edu/library/bannedbooks/books/perks.asp", "http://www.mtv.com/news/2345757/shadowhunters-cast-book-changes/", "http://stepheniemeyer.com/", "http://pro.boxoffice.com/statistics/movies/vampire-academy-blood-sisters-2014", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/mortal-instruments-city-of-bones-movie-review/2013/08/20/f15c1816-09a9-11e3-8974-f97ab3b3c677_story.html", "http://www.mtv.com/news/2219795/john-green-producer-fox-2000/", "http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=beautifulcreatures13.htm", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marshall-fine/movie-review-ithe-hosti_b_2970920.html", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2908446", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385737955", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phJA1GzQMFk", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1686821", "http://articles.latimes.com/2012/nov/01/entertainment/la-et-mn-1101-perks-wallflower20121101", "http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-book-news/article/59044-beautiful-creatures-authors-to-write-spinoff-series.html", "http://www.ew.com/article/2015/04/02/hunger-games-theme-park-officially-go-2016", "http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/lsquothe-mortal-instruments-city-of-bonesrsquo-teen-fantasy-doesnrsquot-fly/", "http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=mazerunner.htm", "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_perks_of_being_a_wallflower/", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304450604576418161912396814", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/host/review/431590", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1840309", "http://thehostthefilm.com/", "http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=divergent.htm", "http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=twilight08.htm", "http://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2014/09/10/dredd-2-vampire-academy-2-and-sequels-to-flop-originals-that-will-probably-never-be/"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:54:06.526+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
