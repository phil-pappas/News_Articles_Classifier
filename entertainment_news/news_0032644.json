The \" Empire \" co-creator launches an international talent search for four main roles on the music drama pilot, \"Star\", which is developed under an overall deal with 20th Century Fox TV. Descriptions of the four roles are as follows: Star : Character is a Caucasian female, 18 years old (actor must be 18 years of age or over). She's a tough chick with a badass attitude. Alexandra : Character is an African-American female, about 20 (actor must be 18 years of age or over). She's an elegant yet classic beauty. Alexandra wants to put this material world behind her so she can make real, authentic music. Simone : Character is half African-American, half Caucasian, Star's younger sister, 16 years old. (actor must be 18 years of age or over). Tragic and adorable. Cotton : Character is a half African-American and half Latina transgender woman with a stunning look, 20 (actor must be 18 years of age or over). She has an especially keen eye for fashion. Those interested to audition for the roles should follow the instructions mentioned in this page .

Tom Donaghy serves as an executive producer and co-writes the pilot with Daniels. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T05:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:40:28.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
