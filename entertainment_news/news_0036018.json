Now, the not-so-jolly green giant might show that he's worthy enough to go smash other planets.\nTo illustrate, JoBlo is reporting that Mark Ruffalo will return as the Hulk in \"Thor: Ragnorak\" with Chris Hemsworth back to bring down the hammer of Odin as the Asgard god of thunder. If that happens, the film will mark the latest Avengers team-up in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) since 2014's \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\", where Cap joined forces with Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), and Sam Wilson/Falcon (Anthony Mackie) in uncovering and exposing the decades-long HYDRA infiltration within S.H.I.E.L.D.. In other words, Captain America was giving the orders to become 'the real SHIELD' that is willing to pay the price for freedom, liberty, and justice.\nHowever, what we may or may not know is that Thor and the Hulk teamed up before in the television film \"The Incredible Hulk Returns\", the first of a trilogy with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno reprising their roles as scientist David Banner and the Hulk from CBS' \"The Incredible Hulk\" (1978-82). Aired on NBC in 1988, the movie was supposed to be a pilot for a potential series that would have starred actor Eric Allan Kramer as Thor, but the pilot wasn't picked up.\n\"Thor: Ragnorak\" is set to have Jaimie Alexander returning as Lady Sif and Tom Hiddleston as Loki, who was partially responsible for assembling the Avengers when they avenged the 'death' of Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg): saving New York City and the world.\nPart of \"Phase Three\" in the MCU, \"Thor: Ragnorak\" is scheduled to come out on November 3, 2017. \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" is available on Blu-Ray and DVD.", "external_links": ["http://www.joblo.com/movie-news/exclusive-mark-ruffalos-hulk-will-return-in-thor-ragnarok-333"], "published": "2015-10-12T23:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:09:58.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
