Once at the top, he lit fireworks and inflated a large killer whale balloon emblazoned with \"SeaWorld Sucks.\"\nThe protest drew a large number of emergency responders who were unsure if Glover needed rescuing. He was charged with creating a false emergency, vandalism and several fireworks violations\nHe also was sentenced Wednesday to three years of probation and ordered to reimburse the city nearly $14,000 for the police and fire response.\nGlover, known for his outlandish stunts in the \"Jackass\" TV show and movies, wore a T-shirt from the anti-Sea World documentary \"Blackfish\" when he scaled the crane.\nUnder the terms of his probation, he'll have to stay away from the neighborhood where the incident took place, refrain from using fireworks and not perform any unpermitted stunts that are likely to draw police and fire responders in Los Angeles.\nHe's scheduled to report to jail in December.\n\"I must say I'm ready to go to jail â€” not just because it will bring so much attention to the plight of orcas in captivity, but because it's nice to let people know I haven't lost my edge,\" Glover's statement said. \"What can I say? I'm a jackass.\"\ncomment (2)", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"], "published": "2015-10-08T00:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:48:03.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
