By MARK LONG TAMPA, Fla. — Jacksonville Jaguars coach Gus Bradley had somehow managed to stay positive.\nThrough all the growing pains, all the costly mistakes, all the mind-numbing losses, Bradley remained upbeat and optimistic with his team.\nHis approach changed dramatically Sunday.\nBradley ripped into his players following a 38-31 loss at Tampa Bay, his team’s 12th consecutive road loss. The Jaguars (1-4) turned the ball over twice, gave up six sacks, had several special teams meltdowns and allowed 183 yards rushing. Bradley had seen enough.\n“I’m hoping that this setback shocks us to get things right, you know,” said Bradley, who fell to 8-29 in three seasons. “I believe in these guys. The reason I’m upset is they’re capable of better. That’s the reason I’m upset. I’m not upset because we’re not very good. We’re capable of being better and we’re not showing it. That’s what frustrating.\n“You say, ‘Hey Gus, you said this was built.’ It is built. We’ve got enough good players in that locker room to do better than what we’re doing on the field today. That’s a fact. I’ve always tried to be honest with everybody — the fans and you guys — and that’s how I’m feeling.”\nPlayers said it was the most frustrated and annoyed they’ve seen Bradley.\n“He went in on us,” veteran tight end Marcedes Lewis said. “Enough is enough. That’s the message he sent. We can’t keep doing this. It’s old now. The excuses are old. Being young and all that, that’s old. At some point you’ve got to grab the bull by the horns and control it.”\nJacksonville did little right.\nBlake Bortles completed 23 of 33 passes for 303 yards, with a career-high four touchdown passes and an interception. Allen Robinson had seven receptions for 72 yards and two scores. And Allen Hurns caught a TD pass for the third consecutive week, finishing with five catches for 116 yards.\nBut Bortles overthrew Robinson twice on deep passes and threw an interception near the sideline while missing Robinson running wide open across the middle of the field. Bortles also was sacked a season-high six times.\nThe offensive miscues weren’t even close to being the team’s biggest problem.\nThe league’s fourth-ranked defense against the run was gashed early and often. Doug Martin ran 24 times for 123 yards and two touchdowns, and Charles Sims added 51 yards on the ground.\n“We didn’t show up today in a lot of different ways,” defensive tackle Roy Miller said. “We got to go out there and figure this out. It’s on us. Everybody’s tired of putting in all the work and not seeing the benefits of it. Enough is enough.”\nThere were other issues, too. Running back Corey Grant, an undrafted rookie from Auburn and fifth on the depth chart, fumbled a pitch near the goal line late in the third quarter and with Jacksonville leading 24-23. Tampa Bay recovered in the end zone for a touchback.\n“It’s not a great feeling, especially with the part of the game it was,” said Grant, who added that it was his first fumble since his freshman year in high school. “I feel like I was ready. That’s just playing football. That’s from Pop Warner league. That’s just a mistake. I learn from it and keep going.”\nEven more egregious was running back Bernard Pierce’s special teams gaffe in the second quarter. Pierce had a clear shot at tackling punt returner Bobby Rainey near the sideline, but for some reason, turned and started blocking a Bucs player. It was almost as if Pierce thought the Jaguars were returning the punt. Rainey ran by for a 58-yard gain that set up Tampa Bay’s first touchdown.\nJacksonville 0 14 10 7 — 31\nTampa Bay 3 17 11 7 — 38\nFirst Quarter\nTB-FG Barth 35, 10:16.\nSecond Quarter\nJax-Hurns 12 pass from Bortles (Myers kick), 14:20.\nTB-FG Barth 45, 10:39.\nTB-D.Martin 10 pass from Winston (Barth kick), 7:26.\nTB-D.Martin 1 run (Barth kick), 2:26.\nJax-A.Robinson 13 pass from Bortles (Myers kick), :36.\nThird Quarter\nJax-FG Myers 31, 10:03.\nJax-Yeldon 4 pass from Bortles (Myers kick), 2:57.\nTB-FG Barth 47, :29.\nTB-J.Smith 3 fumble return (Jackson pass from Winston), :15.\nFourth Quarter\nTB-D.Martin 1 run (Barth kick), 8:26.\nJax-A.Robinson 5 pass from Bortles (Myers kick), 1:05.\nA-58,490.\nJax TB\nFirst downs 21 20\nTotal Net Yards 325 369\nRushes-yards 17-55 40-183\nPassing 270 186\nPunt Returns 2-8 3-85\nKickoff Returns 3-93 0-0\nInterceptions Ret. 0-0 1-1\nComp-Att-Int 23-33-1 13-19-0\nSacked-Yards Lost 6-33 2-23\nPunts 4-55.3 3-33.7\nFumbles-Lost 1-1 0-0\nPenalties-Yards 3-12 10-72\nTime of Possession 25:19 34:41\nINDIVIDUAL STATISTICS\nRUSHING-Jaguars, Yeldon 11-32, Bortles 1-21, Pierce 2-6, Gerhart 1-2, Grant 2-(minus 6).
