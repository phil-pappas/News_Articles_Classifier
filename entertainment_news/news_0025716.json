The stories ran the gamut, with plenty of haunted houses, creepy dolls, murderers lurking in the woods, terror on Halloween night and classic horror villains like witches, vampires, ghosts, zombies, monsters, werewolves â€” and one yeti. Many of the submissions came from schools, where teachers had students create stories and artwork as class assignments. At Shepard Hill Elementary School in Plainfield, one teacher had her students write Creepy Tales as if they were realtors trying to sell a haunted house, with descriptions of blood-filled pools, private graveyards and other bone-chilling amenities. Happy Halloween!
