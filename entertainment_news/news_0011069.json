Maybe we're not Colorado, or even Vermont, but the nation's most maligned state packs plenty of Technicolor-worthy panoramas within its borders. \nAnd now's the perfect time for a road trip, a great opportunity to visit the Jersey less traveled, or appreciated. RELATED: New Jersey's 10 most scenic drives \nFor this list of the state's 10 best scenic views, I left out many worthy candidates. The Great Falls in Paterson. Eagle Rock Reservation in Essex County. Lake Hopatcong or scores of other lakes. Delaware Bay. The view from one of the state's wonderful lighthouses, like Asbecon Lighthouse in Atlantic City or Barnegat Lighthouse -- Old Barney -- on LBI. \nBeing an unabashed Jersey romantic, I was tempted to put the view from the Pulaski Skyway in my top ten, but decided to keep the list to natural attractions. \nSeveral of my spots are off the grid or rarely publicized, but all have that \"wow'' factor. \nA great scenic view does not necessarily mean high on a mountain or at the edge of an ocean; it can mean an unexpected panorama on the state's most reviled highway, or a vest-pocket pond deep in the Pine Barrens. \nAnd by great views I don't mean great views of the Manhattan skyline (for example, at Liberty State Park), even if two of my spots offer distant glimpses of the big city; this is all about Jersey! \nI received many suggestions on Twitter. Here's one: . @petegenovese our view of the LBI Causeway. Just something bout the way the mainland, bridge & LBI frame the water. pic.twitter.com/hdQvnNO8Pa â€” CausewayView (@CausewayView) September 23, 2015 \nSeveral spots on my list take some getting to, but you won't need fancy hiking gear or a SUV to reach them. Bring a camera, though; wow your friends with the photos, and stories. \nWhat's your favorite scenic view in New Jersey?
