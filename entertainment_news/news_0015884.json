He said they went through the house \"a couple of times\" and really enjoyed it. He said he talked to some of the people who were running the house and decided to volunteer.A couple of years into it, he wanted to go bigger and design his own room. The only catch? He had to become a Knight.\"They pretty much said, 'If you want to do your own room, you can become a member. You get your room and you can kind of do whatever theme for your individual room,'\" Wenger said.The Knights of Pythias is a fraternal order, similar to the Elks. Wenger said the order is centered around brotherhood and friendship. The funds raised from the haunted house not only pay for the building's property taxes and insurance, but they also go to an organization in town or an endowment the Knights established with Laramie County Community College.For his first design, he created the toxic waste room, which will be featured in this year's haunted house. The room is darkly-lit with green glow-in-the-dark paint with toppled barrels placed around the room.Wenger said he has also worked on a heaven-and-hell-themed room, the clown rooms and one based on \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\" However, he said his favorite is the clown room.\"We do clowns and chainsaws and it's just kind of two fears that people really dislike,\" Wenger said while laughing.He said he thinks people are drawn to haunted houses because it's one of the best ways to dive into the fall season.\"It's something festive for Halloween,\" he said. \"It's fun. If they enjoy scary movies, it seems like they enjoy doing stuff like this.\"He said he gets excited for the haunted house every year.There is really only one reason Wenger likes to scare people: \"It's fun.\"\"I'm sure I'll continue to do it for quite a while,\" he said.Working in the haunted house is a family affair: Wenger said his wife also helps with the group tours when they first enter the haunted house.\"I have a 16-year-old son and he really enjoys it, too, so I'm kind of pushing him into some of the roles and letting him take on more responsibilities,\" he said.
