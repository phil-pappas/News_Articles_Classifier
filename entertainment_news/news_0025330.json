If you're getting offended by any of these, then you've a lot more to worry about than some jokes on a bench.\nSpeaking to the Chester Chronicle, council member Maria Byrne said \"we have removed the plaques from five benches and although they may appear humorous, some people may find them offensive\"\n\"It has cost the Council taxpayer money for officers to locate and remove them\".\nYou know what wouldn't have cost them anything?
