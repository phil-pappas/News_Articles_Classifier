Nazur said that experience will come into play when his family opens Tasty's Chicago Grill near the top of Main Street hill where Mr. G's used to be. Mr. G's, a Peoria legend for two decades, had a reputation for serving Chicago dogs and hand-cut fries but closed this summer. Now Nazur said Tasty's will bring a taste of Chicago back to Peoria with menu hits like a Chicago hot dog, Italian beef and polish sausage. Brother Dave will run the Peoria store while cousin Jamal operates the Decatur location and Mike Nazur concentrates on another new Tasty's outlet in Belleville in southern Illinois. \"We're shooting for Oct. 19 to open in Peoria,\" said Nazur, adding that family history has instilled certain traditions when it comes to the food they serve. \"We roast our beef for four hours. We char-grille our burgers. We've also got chicken and Philly steak. We use Vienna hot dogs and Vienna polish sausage. They're big sellers (in Decatur),\" he said. There's also a gyro on the Tasty's menu, said Nazur. \"We make our own gyro sauce. People ask why we make our own when we could buy one a lot cheaper. But then our gyro would taste like everybody else's,\" he said. Hours at the Peoria location will be from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m., weekdays, and from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m., Friday and Saturday. \"We might explore later hours in the future,\" said Nazur.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:42:12.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
