Kennedy's 1960 Allentown stop is focus of new exhibit \n'JFK Returns to the Lehigh Valley' an exhibit at the Lehigh County Heritage Museum (APRIL BARTHOLOMEW / THE MORNING CALL ) Margie Peterson Special to The Morning Call JFK visited Allentown and Bethlehem in a whirlwind campaign stop that attracted an estimated 85,000 people. \nJohn F. Kennedy was in the final days of his 1960 presidential election campaign in a close race with Richard Nixon when he visited Allentown and Bethlehem in a whirlwind campaign stop that attracted an estimated 85,000 people. \nKennedy's plane was supposed to land at what was then the Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton Airport before midnight Oct. 28. But when 15,000 people turned out to greet him, security officials were so concerned by the size and enthusiasm of the crowd they delayed the landing by about 90 minutes. \nAfter the plane touched down, JFK climbed on top of a white convertible and spoke briefly to the eager throng. The next day he gave speeches at Moravian College and before tens of thousands of people assembled near the Soldiers and Sailors Monument at Seventh and Hamilton streets in Allentown. He stayed overnight at Hotel Bethlehem. \nOn Nov. 8, Kennedy defeated Nixon in one of the closest presidential elections of the 20th century. He was the youngest president in history. \nJoseph Garrera, executive director of the Lehigh Valley Heritage Museum, says it's really hard to overestimate how much excitement Kennedy's visit created in the Valley. \n\"He wasn't just a candidate, he was a rock star,\" Garrera says. JFK's youthful good looks, charisma and eloquence gave him a broad appeal that transcended politics. (Margie Peterson) \nThe trappings of JFK's Valley visit, including campaign posters, photos, hats, stories from The Call-Chronicle newspaper (now The Morning Call) and other memorabilia will be on display in an exhibit that opens at the Heritage Museum Saturday. The exhibit also focuses on other aspects of Kennedy's life and presidency and includes large photographs of him during significant events. \nHistorian Martin Sandler, who recently edited JFK's letters for the book \"The Letters of John F. Kennedy,\" will speak at noon and sign books afterward. Sandler has written more than 80 books and been nominated twice for a Pulitzer Prize. ADDISON GEORGE / SPECIAL TO THE MORNING CALL Barbara Thayer saw JFK in 1960 while with a friend, her son and his friend. They drove through closed off roads in her convertible. Worried that they'd get in trouble, they all wore fake prank noses. When JFK saw them he laughed. Barbara Thayer saw JFK in 1960 while with a friend, her son and his friend. They drove through closed off roads in her convertible. Worried that they'd get in trouble, they all wore fake prank noses. When JFK saw them he laughed. (ADDISON GEORGE / SPECIAL TO THE MORNING CALL) \nThe exhibit includes a collection of 11 original black-and-white evidence photographs from the Dallas Police Department that show the inside and outside of the Texas School Book Depository in Dallas where Lee Harvey Oswald fired the shots that killed Kennedy on Nov. 22, 1963. One photo shows Oswald's rifle where it was found amid boxes in the Depository. \n\"You can almost smell the dust in there and [feel] the heat,\" Garrera says. Another picture shows bullet shell casings from the rifle. The photos are part of a private collection, and Saturday will be the first time they have been displayed in public, Garrera says. They will be part of the exhibit for only two weeks. \nAlso in the exhibit are photographs and newspaper clippings and fliers from Kennedy's Allentown visit. \nTo set the mood of the time, classic cars from that era will be parked outside the museum Saturday and a Kennedy campaign jingle recorded by Frank Sinatra will play, as will a recording of JFK speaking. Campaign posters and life-size cardboard cutouts of Kennedy will greet visitors. \n\"We want people to come here and feel like they've had an experience with meeting JFK,\" Garrera says. \"Our objective is to give people a close encounter with history.\" \nThe exhibit, which has been a couple of years in the making, had its genesis in a conversation Garrera had with Allentown lawyer Malcolm Gross. Gross, a member of the Lehigh County Historical Society board, told Garrera that his family had original newspaper clippings of coverage of JFK's visit which were saved by his father John T. \"Jack\" Gross, who was mayor of Allentown at the time. Jack Gross introduced Kennedy at his speech at Seventh and Hamilton. The Gross family donated those clippings to the museum. \n\"One of the reasons we did this exhibit was that so many people have come to us and said it was one of the most historic episodes of their life,\" Garrera says. \"The number of people who remember the event of him coming to Allentown is enormous.\" \nPennslvania was considered a battleground state in the election. It went to JFK. \nBut Valley voters were split. Kennedy won in Northampton County and Nixon took Lehigh County. In mock elections at Lehigh University and Muhlenberg College, Nixon won by a small margin, Garrera says. \nThe exhibit hits many of the noteworthy points of Kennedy's 1,036 days in office, including the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and the creation of the Peace Corps. One of the enlarged photos shows JFK and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy at a breakfast in Fort Worth, Texas, three hours before he was shot and killed in Dallas. \nOther displays include front pages of newspapers reporting the Kennedy assassination and drawings by political cartoonists and illustrators reacting to it. \nWhat museum-goers won't see is any photographs of Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald. The omission is by design because the museum staff didn't want to give Oswald the attention he was said to have craved. \nIn 2001, Garrera interviewed Sergei Khrushchev, the son of Nikita Khrushchev, and asked him what the Russian leader thought of JFK. The younger Khrushchev told Garrera that his father spoke favorably of Kennedy and at Garrera's request, Sergei put his thoughts down on paper. He wrote: \"My father Nikita Khrushchev and JFK found common ground. Had their terms in office been extended, the Cold War would have ended sooner.\" That message, too, will be part of the display. \nBut the exhibit won't ignore Kennedy's imperfections and indiscretions, Garrera says. There will be a section devoted to Kennedy's critics. \nWhile assembling the exhibition, Garrera and curator Jill Youngken, assistant director of the museum and chief curator, read all the transcripts of Kennedy's press conferences during his presidency. Those transcripts show that JFK was eloquent even without the talented speechwriters who crafted many of his lines, Youngken says. \nThe previous president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, was 70 when he left office, and Americans were swept up by Kennedy's youthful energy and optimism, which inspired confidence, she says. \nIf Kennedy had lived, he would be 98 today. His popularity with Americans has grown in the 52 years since his assassination. \n\"There is a [Gallup] report that says he is the most popular president with the Millennials,\" Garrera says. \"Kennedy still communicates with us today. He inspires us.\" \nMargie Peterson is a freelance writer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:51:18.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
