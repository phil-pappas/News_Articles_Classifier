Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., greets audience members during a concert hosted by his campaign, Friday, Oct. 23, 2015, in Davenport, Iowa. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall) \nDES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — The latest on the Iowa Democratic Party’s Jefferson-Jackson dinner, the traditional kickoff leading to the Feb. 1 caucuses. Speakers include presidential candidates Hillary Rodham Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley. All times local. \n10:30 p.m. \nHillary Rodham Clinton has high praise for Vice President Joe Biden, a man many thought she’d be running against for the Democratic nomination. \nThe former secretary of state led the audience at a Democratic dinner in a round of applause for Biden. She said it was a show of appreciation for all he’s done for the country. \nBiden announced this past week that he would not seek the presidency. Clinton’s main competitor in the primary race is independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. \nClinton pledged at the Iowa Democratic Party’ big annual fundraising dinner that as president she would raise the minimum wage, spend on education and fight for gun control. She stressed her experience working in Washington and said she knows “how to stand my ground and find common ground.” \n___ \n10:10 p.m. \nMartin O’Malley is stressing that he is a presidential candidate of “actions, not words” during a Democratic dinner in Iowa. \nThe former Maryland governor appeared Saturday at the Iowa Democratic Party’s Jefferson-Jackson Dinner. O’Malley has campaigned heavily in Iowa, but has struggled in the race. \nO’Malley is highlighting his executive experience as a mayor and governor. He notes his efforts to raise the minimum wage and improve education in Maryland. \nO’Malley stresses that voters in Iowa hold great power with their leadoff caucuses. He says the race is “not about polls and pundits” but the people. \n___ \n9:20 p.m. \nBernie Sanders is suggesting that Hillary Rodham Clinton is revising history in explaining why her husband signed an act in the 1990s defining marriage as a union of a man and a woman under federal law. \nThe Vermont senator and 2016 presidential hopeful says the goal of the Defense of Marriage Act was clearly to “discriminate against gays and lesbians” and noted he was against it back then. \nClinton told MSNBC this past week that the law signed by President Bill Clinton was a line drawn to stop discrimination against gays from going deeper. \nSanders, without mentioning Clinton, says remarks like that are revisionist. \nHe says “some are trying to rewrite history by saying they voted for one anti-gay law to stop something worse” and “that’s not the case.” \n___ \n9 p.m. \nBernie Sanders is using a speech before Iowa Democrats to highlight contrasts with Hillary Rodham Clinton. \nSanders is playing up his opposition to a new trade deal and the Keystone XL pipeline and reminding people he was against the Iraq war at the outset. \nIn his prepared remarks, the Vermont senator says voters should look at the choices he made and realize his message today “is the same as it was yesterday, and will be tomorrow.” \nSanders is not naming Clinton but clearly questioning her recent shifts on some issues. \nClinton announced her opposition to the pipeline after saying in 2010 she was inclined to support it. Her opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership came nearly three years after she pitched it as the “gold standard” of trade deals. \nSanders says: “It is not now, nor has it ever been, the gold standard of trade agreements.” \nClinton also voted in favor of the Iraq war as a senator. \n___ \n6 p.m. \nBernie Sanders is firing up supporters in Iowa before the state Democratic Party’s big fundraising dinner. \nThe presidential contender led cheering supporters on a bridge across the Des Moines River in a march to the dinner hall. There, some 2,000 supporters were entertained by a student drill team. There were chants from the crowd, like “Hey, hey, ho, ho, the oligarchy has to go!” \nAt a pre-march rally, Sanders vowed: “This country belongs to all of us, not just wealthy campaign donors.” \n___ \n5:15 p.m. \nHillary Rodham Clinton made a surprise appearance at a concert for her campaign headlined by pop singer Katy Perry. Clinton urged Iowans to caucus for her on Feb. 1st. \nIn a hat tip to Perry, Clinton said sometimes “you just have to roar” in a reference to Perry’s hit song. \nClinton says the nation needs to build on President Barack Obama’s progress and, as she put it, “not let Republicans rip it away.” \nPerry took the stage after former President Bill Clinton and performed “Roar,” which has become an anthem for Hillary Clinton’s campaign. \nPerry called Hillary Clinton her “firework” and appeared in a white strapless gown adorned with a Clinton campaign emblem and a flowing American flag as a cape. \nShe also performed “Wide Awake,””America the Beautiful” and “Firework.” \n___ \n5 p.m. \nBill Clinton says it’s time for men to knock down a gender barrier at the White House. He wants to be the first male presidential spouse. \nWith tongue in cheek, the former president complained at a rally for his wife that he’s tired of women having a “stranglehold” on that position. \nClinton spoke in Des Moines in advance of the Iowa Democratic Party’s Jefferson-Jackson dinner. \nThe big fundraiser will hear from presidential contenders Hillary Rodham Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley. \n___ \n4:45 p.m. \nA large crowd of Hillary Rodham Clinton supporters filed into a parking lot outside Hy-Vee Hall for a kickoff concert with pop singer Katy Perry and an appearance by former President Bill Clinton. \nPerry got into the act early this morning. She recorded a wake-up phone call that was sent to Clinton’s Iowa organizers at 5:30 a.m. local time. \n“Wake-y, wake-y! Eggs and bakey. It’s Katy Perry here,” the pop singer says in the call. “I know it’s early, but you know what they say, the early bird gets the votes.” \nAs the crowd waited for Perry, a pro-Bernie Sanders bi-plane flew overhead pulling a banner: “Revolution Starts Now: Feel the Bern.” Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T06:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:03:38.284+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
