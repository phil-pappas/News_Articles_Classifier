Combining these with activities that have already proven successful, she will guide participants in putting together a creative practice that can serve as the foundation of their artistry. Attendees should come with paper and pen, prepared to participate in dynamic discussion and creative prompts and exercises. \nPiccari, proprietor of The Village Scribe, is a writer, teacher and creativity coach. A professional writer for 32 years, Piccari has been teaching writing for 18 years. Her workshop palette includes Creative Writing, Heroic Journey and Memoir & Personal Essay.
