(Photo: Rock and Roll Hall of Fame) \nMotown's Spinners are among the nominees for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, announced Thursday.\nThe group was formed in 1954 as the Domingoes, made up of friends who attended Lincoln High School in Ferndale. As the Spinners, they had some success on Gwen Gordy and Harvey Fuqua’s Detroit-based Tri-Phi label with the song “That’s What Girls are Made For” in 1961, then were absorbed into Motown.\nPerhaps the biggest Spinners hit at Motown was the Stevie Wonder-penned \"It's a Shame,\" from 1970, with G.C. Cameron on vocals. The group moved to Atlantic Records at Aretha Franklin's suggestion and racked up many more hits featuring Philippe Wynne and Bobbie Smith on lead vocals: \"I'll Be Around,\" “Could it Be I'm Falling in Love,\" and \"Mighty Love,\" to name a few.\nThe Rock Hall also continues to open up more to progressive rock, nominating Yes and Deep Purple this year.\nOther nominated acts include: The Cars, Chaka Khan, Chicago, Cheap Trick, Chic, The J.B.'s (James Brown's band), Janet Jackson, Los Lobos, Steve Miller, N.W.A., Nine Inch Nails and The Smiths.\nBallots will be sent out, voting will commence, and the slate of Rock Hall inductees will be announced in December.\nswhitall@detroitnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T10:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:21:13.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
