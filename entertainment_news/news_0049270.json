In fact, he told Time Out he would rather “slash my wrists” than make another Bond flick. \nThe star, who will reprise his role as the British spy for the fourth time in the forthcoming Spectre movie, told Time Out magazine he wanted to “move on” from the franchise. \nBut he added if he were to do another 007 film it would “only be for the money”. \nWhen asked whether he could imagine doing another Bond movie, he said: “Now? I’d rather break this glass and slash my wrists. No, not at the moment. Not at all. That’s fine. I’m over it at the moment. We’re done. All I want to do is move on.” \nOuch. \nSo what’s next for Daniel, if another Bond flick is truly off the cards? The 47-year-old star revealed that he had not given “any thought” to his future. \nHe said: “For at least a year or two, I just don’t want to think about it. I don’t know what the next step is. I’ve no idea. Not because I’m trying to be cagey. Who the fuck knows? At the moment, we’ve done it. I’m not in discussion with anybody about anything. If I did another Bond movie, it would only be for the money.” (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc/PA) \nAs for potential his successor, Daniel said his advice would be that they “embrace it”. \n“Don’t be shit. You’ve got to step up. People do not make movies like this any more. This is really rare now. So don’t be shit,” he added. \nSpectre reunites Daniel with director Sam Mendes after 2012′s Skyfall became the highest-grossing Bond film in history. (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc/PA) \nNaomie Harris, Ralph Fiennes, Ben Whishaw and Rory Kinnear return for Spectre, alongside newcomers to the franchise such as Christoph Waltz, Andrew Scott, Dave Bautista and Bond girls Lea Seydoux, Monica Bellucci and Stephanie Sigman.
