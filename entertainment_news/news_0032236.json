It's the latest book phenomenon that's part of a wave of niche market breakouts rocketing to the top of multiple bestseller lists. But with a title addressing the explosive topic of rape, the latest 'must-read book of the moment' comes loaded with controversy surrounding its treatment of women.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151012/276056\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151012/276057\nSimilar to New York Times best sellers \"The Martian,\" \"Game of Thrones\" and \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" that broke out of small genre readership into mainstream book-buying America, The Raping of Ava DeSantis has also spread like wildfire via word of mouth, and propelled its readership from horror novel enthusiasts into the massive best-seller reading community.\nSet in 1991 in Atlanta, Georgia , The Raping of Ava DeSantis tells the story of a poor college girl from New Jersey who's brutally attacked by three wealthy Southern fraternity brothers, paid hush money to stay quiet about the crime, then seeks revenge against her perpetrators (and their families) decades later.\nThe novel - a first for female Hollywood screenwriter Mylo Carbia - made headlines for rocketing up to the #1 best seller spot three days after its exclusive release on Amazon, and earning an astonishing average of 4.7 stars out of five by reviewers on Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Goodreads and other trusted book-related websites.\nBut what makes this novel controversial is like E.L. James , Carbia tackles taboo subjects usually considered offensive to women, including gang-rape, graphic female on male violence, the darkness of the BDSM world, and a three-way sex scene described by AMB Magazine as \"Making 'Fifty Shades of Grey' read like a boring training manual\" - all while weaving a sophisticated, suspenseful thriller worthy of the industry's best writing accolades.\nMany books have hit the shelves since 'Fifty Shades', so what makes this novel so special? Industry insiders say that in addition to Carbia's unique, powerful writing style, she has somehow managed to make a controversial subject appealing to the masses - particularly women ages 18 to 44 who consider themselves voracious readers of anything but horror. One of those readers, twenty-seven-year-old Carey Carson of Brooklyn, New York stood in line for two hours at New York Comic Con to have Carbia sign a copy of her book. \"I've never read horror before reading Mylo Carbia ,\" she said while waiting in line. \"I was shocked at the title but when my co-worker told me about this novel, I had to read it... It's definitely the best book I've read in years. I'm now a fan for life and can't wait to read her follow-up 'Violets Are Red' this summer.\"\nAs a screenwriter, Carbia spent 13 years ghostwriting films for major directors and producers. Before releasing her first novel, she had already developed a hefty social media following of nearly 100,000 fans in 26 countries. In 2015, Carbia announced she would leave ghostwriting for good to release a series of novels under her own name. Her debut novel (released exclusively on Amazon last month) hit #1 Bestseller in New Releases and #1 Bestseller in American Horror three days after its unannounced early release date.\nHowever, unlike 'Fifty Shades', Carbia is receiving worldwide critical acclaim for her writing skills and storytelling abilities. Called \"The Best Novel of the Year\" by Great-Novels.com, \"Best Thriller of the Year\" by top10novels.com and \"Horror's Next New York Times Bestseller\" by All Indie Magazine, in addition to receiving numerous five-star reviews from hundreds of book-themed websites across the Internet, one can see how this niche novel is easily turning into a worldwide phenomenon.\nBut not everyone is a fan of Carbia's instant literary success. One horror blogger critical of Carbia's treatment of women posted \" Mylo Carbia is not a role model for women in horror, she is a set back...the fact that she is drawing comparisons to Stephen King and that this book is gaining a lot of attention and sales is frustrating to me.\"\nEither way, only time will tell how international audiences receive Carbia's writing, and more importantly, whether the momentum surrounding this 'book of the moment' is temporary or evidence that a new powerhouse author is here to stay.\nThe Raping of Ava DeSantis by Mylo Carbia is now available in both print and eBook formats on Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Apple iBooks, Kobo and 30,000 physical bookstores worldwide.\nTo order or download your copy today, simply visit:\nhttp://www.Amazon-Bestsellers-2015.com\nhttp://www.Amazon-Bestsellers.co.uk\nhttp://www.RapingAva.com\nTo arrange an interview or schedule a book signing with Mylo Carbia , please contact:\nLisa Granger-Whipple\nEllison Public Relations\nEmail\nUSA 1+(310) 873-3645\n releases/the-raping-of-ava-desantis-dethrones-fifty-shades-of-grey-as-most-controversial-novel-in-america-300158423.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.amazon-bestsellers.co.uk/", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=PH25783&Transmission_Id=201510130850PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH25783&DateId=20151013", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-raping-of-ava-desantis-dethrones-fifty-shades-of-grey-as-most-controversial-novel-in-america-300158423.html", "http://pressreleaseheadlines.com/contact?pid=292227", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151012/276056", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151012/276057", "http://www.amazon-bestsellers-2015.com/", "http://www.rapingava.com/"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:38:07.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
