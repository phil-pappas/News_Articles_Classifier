His last album, \"Love & Other Social Issues,\" was released in 2007. \n\"The beautiful thing about being an independent artist is that you don't have record company deadlines looming over you. The bad thing about being an independent artist is that you don't have record company deadlines looming over you,\" he said. \nWinning his first Grammy Award earlier this year for his work on Robert Glasper's \"Jesus Children\" was the push he needed. \n\"That really put the fire underneath me and put some finality to it. I have to finish this record while I have the attention of the Grammy committee and the attention of the music world,\" he said. \nWarner found fame at a young age starring as Theo Huxtable on the long-running NBC sitcom. He credits his mother for never allowing him to rest on the laurels of his early success. \n\"When the show first hit I was 14 years old and my mother sat me down and said, 'Hey baby, it's great that the show is the phenomenon that it is, but you know how this business is. The show could be over next year. What are you going to do when the show is over?'\" he recalled. \"Sometimes it's annoying, but it's like my mother is always right!\" \nOnline:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T15:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:52:09.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
