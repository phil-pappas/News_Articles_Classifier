Titled \"All About You\", the track was premiered on the teen's SoundCloud page on Thursday, October 15. Silento proudly talks about his \"shawty\" and how he's falling head over heels in love with her on the mid-tempo R&B/rap tune. \"You always on my mind/ Missin' me all the time/ See me on your top 9/ You the only one that can hit me on the FaceTime, girl/ It's all about you,\" he sings. Silento's catchy debut single \"Watch Me\" was a huge hit, peaking at No. 3 on Billboard Hot 100. Its music video has so far garnered more than 300 million views on YouTube. Along with the smash, \"All About You\" will presumably make the cut to Silento's upcoming debut studio album which he's still working hard on. The LP is expected to come out in early 2016 via Capitol Records. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T05:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:22:56.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
