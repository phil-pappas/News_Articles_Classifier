Over time, it's evolved from being about people trying to escape the undead to people trying to outlast others as civilization and order has crumbled around them.\n\"It was always going to be about how an environment changes people,\" star Andrew Lincoln said. \"Some turn to the dark and some try and keep hope alive.\"\nLincoln said that in the sixth season, however, the zombies make a comeback: \"The zombies are very much back in the foreground.\"\n\"Emotionally, physically, everything is absolutely relentless,\" added actor Ross Marquand. \"They're dealing with the threats from all these different tribal factions that are trying to kill them. We're dealing with more and more zombies than ever before. It's just incredible.\"\n\"The Walking Dead\" is one of the most watched shows on television and has a global fan base.\n\"I'm from Zimbabwe,\" actress Danai Gurira said. \"People watch it there. I've been stopped on the streets of Zimbabwe for being Michonne so, it doesn't get more far away than that, you know? It's really exciting to see that my work in the United States is embraced by my other home that's so far away.\"\nThe sixth season of \"The Walking Dead\" premieres Sunday at 9 p.m. Eastern.\n___\nOnline:\nhttp://www.amc.com/shows/the-walking-dead\n___\nFollow Alicia Rancilio at http://www.twitter.com/aliciar/\nGet great articles like this sent to your inbox!
