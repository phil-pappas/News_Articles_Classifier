Marlene King, the new intro for \" Pretty Little Liars \" is released in full ahead of the season 6B premiere. As revealed before, Alison ( Sasha Pieterse ) is now joining the four Liars, Aria ( Lucy Hale ), Emily ( Shay Mitchell ), Hanna ( Ashley Benson ) and Spencer ( Troian Bellisario ). They are all dressed in black and someone is lying in a coffin, but it's unknown whose funeral they're attending. While Aria always made the \"Shh!\" in the opening credits of previous seasons, the girls will now take turn sharing the duties with Emily doing the honors in the video released via E! News . \"Fun new intro when we come back in January. Everyone gets a turn to shhh,\" King previously teased the intro in a tweet posted in September. A behind-the-scenes video shows each of the girls doing the \"Shh!\" \"Liars\" will return with the remaining of its sixth season in January. King says in season 6B, the girls are \"in very different places\" five years in the future. She adds, \"I don't want to give you all the answers because that's part of the fun of the story when we find them. They're still friends, but like what happens after you get out of college, you don't get to see your friends all the time. So there's a reason they have to come back to town and they're bringing some secrets back with them, too.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:59:43.221+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
