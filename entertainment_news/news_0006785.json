It made it a very personal experience because I went back to where my mum’s from but also I went to the jungle and I’d never been to a west African jungle before and that was just immense,” he said. Idris Elba plays the Commandant (Netflix) \n“I’ve never seen anything like it. I’ve seen waterfalls on postcards and on film but to see one in real life in Africa, it was breath-taking.” \nIdris’s co-stars, who included acting newcomer Abraham Attah as teenage soldier Agu, held him in such high regard they would salute him throughout the day. \nHe explained: “The truth of the matter is the extras were so engaged in it. They’d been going to boot camp three weeks before I even got there so these were practically soldiers. And I show up and there’s a natural respect for me as an actor, Idris Elba! Great. \n“But then I’m playing the Commandant and they saw my get-up… We were sitting in tents in the jungle and we were an army. And the extras, every time they saw me they [would salute] ‘Yes commander’. \n“(I’d say) ‘It’s alright guys, I’m just going to the toilet. Relax, chill out’. But it was a very sweet, warming, engaging process.” Idris Elba and Abraham Attah (Arthur Mola/Invision) \nIdris added: “I did my research and looked into what is the common denominator amongst warlords and it turns out to be charisma. \n“They’re all charismatic, all have a commanding presence, whether you hate them or love them, you’ll find yourself compelled to listen to them. They might be talking absolute nonsense but you find yourself compelled by it.” Share article \nBeasts Of No Nation is out on Netflix now.
