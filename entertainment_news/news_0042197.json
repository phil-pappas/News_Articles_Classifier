Stine’s ‘Fear Street’ Books Scare Up a Movie Friday, October 9th, 2015 at 12:21pm PST Tweet \nEven as “Goosebumps” barrels toward theaters, an adaptation of another R.L. Stine series is in the works. \nTheWrap reports Fox and Chernin Entertainment are developing a movie based on “Fear Street,” the long-running series of horror books aimed at teenage readers. \nEffectively the older, bloodier siblings to Stine’s “Goosbumps” series, the “Fear Street” books are set in fictional Shadyside, Ohio, where average teenagers grapple with malevolent, and occasionally supernatural, adversaries. Stine revived the 26-year-old series just last year. \n“Goosebumps,” starring Jack Black as a fictionalized Stine, opens Oct. 26. Sony Pictures is already discussing a potential sequel .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T22:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:45:29.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
