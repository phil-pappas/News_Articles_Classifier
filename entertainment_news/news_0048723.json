She was flying home from Los Angeles after working on the show last week when she suffered a so-called “mini-stroke” that put her in the hospital. She helpfully posted a sickbed snapshot.\nZolciak Biermann has reported a full recovery but was dropped under series rules because she missed a performance. She’s campaigning to get back on the series, which airs at 8 p.m. Mondays, proof of its addictive nature.\nThere’s more than bragging rights at stake. “Dancing With the Stars” has helped contestants rev up their careers and even reshape their images, as happened when Jerry Springer , the king of rowdy TV talk shows, waltzed his way to a more lovable public persona.\nBut the earliest years of the show seemed to carry less risk, with scant physical fallout on the books. Is the quest for the mirror ball trophy becoming more competitive? Or are American celebrities, along with the rest of America, becoming less fit? Nah, impossible, with zero still the preferred dress size in Hollywood.\nHere’s a tally of the more seriously afflicted since the show’s 2005 debut, including one professional dancer. As a testament to their dedication, only a handful of the 200-plus contestants to date have withdrawn because of health problems.\n■ Marie Osmond faints in Season 5, citing windedness from air pollution.\n■ Cristian de la Fuente suffers a bicep tendon rupture in Season 6, refuses surgery and dances on.\n■ Two-time Olympic beach volleyball gold medalist Misty May-Treanor leaves the show in Season 7 after tearing her Achilles tendon in rehearsal.\nOlympic gold medalist and former contestant on the celebrity dance competition series “Dancing With the Stars,” Misty May-Treanor attends the 2008 Glamour Women of the Year Awards at Carnegie Hall in New York.

He just wanted the right one. The one he picked would make many other actors run screaming into Times Square.\nThe “Closer” and “Inside Man” star finds himself making his Broadway debut this fall in a revival of Harold Pinter ’s “Old Times,” a heady brew of sexual tension and deceit wrapped in a thin, polite coating. It opens Tuesday.\n“It’s so full and complex that it takes everything you’ve got as an actor,” Owen said recently.\nBriefly\n■ British Olympic diver Tom Daley and Oscar-winning screenwriter Dustin Lance Black have announced their engagement.\nCompiled by Janet Graham from\nFree Press news services.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cb0e74ce74a6f17dee6c35e3a6bd0c9c7330e6e7/r=260x400/local/-/media/2015/10/01/DetroitFreePress/B9319090875Z.1_20151001155910_000_G26C3RG7U.1-0.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ebb56192722b62b9737299cd1bab9b540f0812dd/c=0-45-1946-2640&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/10/01/DetroitFreePress/B9319090875Z.1_20151001155910_000_G26C3RG7U.1-0.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/01/DetroitFreePress/B9319090875Z.1_20151001155910_000_G26C3RG7U.1-0.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T07:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:29:51.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
