While it's unknown how the movie will be like if it really moves forward, actor Sean Astin recently shared his ideas for the proposed sequel. While the 44-year-old actor knew nothing about the story or plotlines, he thought that there might be some other versions of the sequel, like an animation or a Broadway show. \"I don't know what it would look like either. But I'm absolutely convinced some versions of it will happen eventually, because people really want it. And when people want something that bad, it's the job of the studio to deliver,\" he said. \"I've got a kid in college now. I don't know if it's ['The Goonies'] and their kids, or they just do a total reboot. Is it about people later in life rediscovering the magic? I don't know,\" Astin explained. \"They have lots of ideas and they've been developing in different ways, but I just don't think they've arrived at what they think the best option is. I wish they'd just break the logjam, because it's so popular, they could probably do a cartoon and a Broadway show and other versions of movies. I think they're just holding on too tight.\" Back in June, writer Chris Columbus said that they're still looking for the right writer to pen the screenplay. In September, Astin assured fans that the possible sequel would definitely happen. However, the actor had no idea if he would appear in the movie. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T08:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T11:09:26.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
