Joshua Lagunez/Special to The Morning News By JOSHUA LAGUNEZ A small cafe with billowing aromas of freshly baked pastries and sandwiches, reminiscent of a stroll through a Parisian neighborhood, might not be expected on Savannah’s Bay Street — at least not before Cafe M began serving up French recipes last month.\nThe iconic image of Parisians relaxing at a quaint cafe might not be too far off.\n“The cliche is real,” said Amanda de Bruc de Montplaisir, co-owner and baker at Cafe M.\nIt’s a cliche that inspired Amanda and her husband Arthur to leave their life in Paris and bring their recipes to Savannah. After moving to the United States in early 2014, the couple secured a space next to the River Street Inn, just west of River Street Access.\nThey went to lengths to create an ambience that evokes Parisian style — designing and painting much of the cafe themselves — but their goal isn’t to be completely French.\n“There is no point in opening a business and importing everything foreign. Savannah is a very touristic place. When you visit Savannah, you don’t want to be in a place where everything is French. To me, that is nonsense,” Arthur said.\nThe result is a mingling of French aesthetic with southern ingredients.\n“The idea is to make French recipes and adapt them to local products — products that are easy to find here,” Arthur said.\nArthur handles the savory side of the menu: the baguette sandwiches and croissant melts. A couple of items off the menu include The Provence, a baguette sandwich with prosciutto ham, mozzarella cheese, sun dried tomatoes, basil pesto and kalamata olives, as well as a turkey, cheddar and dijonnaise croissant melt.\nArthur has other ideas in the works, as well, including a hot dog croissant.\nAmanda specializes in sweets, with pies being one of her favorite desserts to make. Her long list of flavors includes a spin on the southern classic pecan pie and a golden sugar pie, which is a recipe from northern France.\nCustomers will find pralines there, too, but they’re not the pecan, caramel-colored ones you find at River Street Sweets or the Candy Kitchen. Cafe M uses a different nut altogether. Amanda follows a recipe from southeast France and uses almonds coated three times with sugar and dye to make them pink.\nLes Pralines Rose, as they’re called, can be served by themselves, sprinkled over a croissant or\nincluded on almond cookies.\nCafe M serves up a number of drinks to pair with a sweet treat. They have caramel, fudge chocolate, pecan praline and organic vanilla lattes and an assortment of flavored chocolate drinks and frappes.\nBut it’s their iced tea — or tea over ice as they call it — that flips another southern recipe on its head.\nInstead of making sweet tea with sugar, chilling it in the fridge and serving it over ice, Amanda boils the water and soaks the tea bags, pouring it directly over ice after a few minutes and serves it chilled. Customers can order this flash-chilled tea in four flavors: black ceylon gold, white ginger pear, green mango peach or herbal raspberry nectar.\n“You put the boiling water and you pour it over ice, so it’s really iced tea. You can’t be more fresh than that,” Amanda said.\nOf the products they don’t make in-house, the croissant ended up being one of them. The pastry — with flakes lighter than air and a sweetness that could make it a dessert all on its own — was a recipe they just couldn’t refine to their approval.\n“For us, the croissant is sacred,” Amanda said.\nAfter efforts to make a croissant without French ingredients came short of perfection, they decided to import croissants from France instead.\n“We didn’t feel we should sell the croissant if it wasn’t the taste that we know,” she said.\nIf You Go\nWhat: Cafe M\nWhere: 128 E.
