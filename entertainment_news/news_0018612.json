The gallery and retail store on Main Street is operated by the nonprofit Island Institute as part of its economic development program and features the work of dozens of island and coastal artists. \nMore than 30 current artists have been with the store for the last 15 years, including local potters Nancy Button of Warren and Richard Robertson of Rockport. Since opening in 2000, Archipelago has helped advance the careers of more than 800 Maine artists, while playing a role in the city’s emergence as a dynamic center of arts and culture. The retail store returns commissions to all of its artists, totaling more than $2 million in its first 15 years. \nNearly $1 million has gone to island artists, who traditionally have had a difficult time reaching mainland markets. Archipelago is credited for doing a lot for island artists, said Martha Morris-Gibson, who lives and makes traditional Shaker-style baskets on Peaks Island. She has had her work at Archipelago since the venue opened. \n“A lot of different people see our work,” Morris-Gibson said. “They have a different clientele than we do out here on the island.” \nThroughout the year, the Archipelago staff spends more than 400 hours mentoring artists who would like to grow their businesses and increase their economic opportunities, particularly those living year-round on Maine islands. That support includes advice and guidance on product pricing, wholesales, design and packaging.
