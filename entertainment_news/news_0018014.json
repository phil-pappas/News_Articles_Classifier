ABC’s “Nightline” is apologizing for confusing new network star Priyanka Chopra with another Indian actress. The news magazine aired a feature earlier this week about Chopra, the star of ABC’s new drama “Quantico.” A video shot supposedly showing Chopra in the Miss World pageant was actually Yukta Mookhey, who won the crown in 1999. Chopra was the 2000 Miss World winner.
