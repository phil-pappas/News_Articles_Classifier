It seems that actor Samir Ghanem, father of actress Amy Samir Ghanem, has spilled the beans about his daughter and actor Hassan al-Raddad's engagement, Egypt Independent reports. After a cat-and-mouse game of denials over whether the pair were even dating, Ghanem told CBC on Wednesday that he \"can feel the good intentions of both Raddad and Amy to get into a serious relationship\" and hinted that they would be marrying soon . Funny girl Amy and heartthrob Hassan have fiercely guarded their privacy and have spent almost a year denying all rumours of them being together. Back in November of last year, Amy took to her Facebook account to say \"Hello my friends, there is a circulating rumor that states I have gotten engaged, this is merely a rumor and please no one believe it. When I do get engaged I will invite you all to the big occasion,\" the star posted to her Facebook page. Three months later, Hassan was forced to issue a press release, slamming the media for always linking him to his co-stars. Well, as Amy and Hassan are co-stars on Haq Mayet, where there is smoke, there's fire huh? Apparently Amy is mortified by her dad's indiscretion, as now all those denials makes her look a bit foolish. We're still waiting for the official announcements that they promised to make on their facebook accounts, but in the meantime we wish the happy couple all the best and can't wait for the big day!
