He gravitated toward the local Goth kids, who didn’t judge. He discovered the music — the Cure, Pet Shop Boys — and the fashion — black, lots of black — that spoke to him. He did his share of drugs. And he became a master storyteller, good enough to win the Moth Slam three times.\nAnd he wrote a memoir, Bad Kid (Harper Perennial, $14.99). Crabb, 39, will discuss it at the Texas Book Festival, which will be Oct. 17-18 in Austin. It will be a homecoming of sorts: He grew up in San Antonio and Seguin, a self-described “gay Goth teen in South Texas,” navigating life in both a big city and small town.\nHe found his fellow misfits in both places.\n“There are weirdos everywhere,” he says in an interview at BookExpo America in New York earlier this year. “Sometimes in a big city they’re easier to find because they’re competing with each other. In a small town, they’re not as easy to find because they might not be a part of a clique or a club. But you find them.”\nBad Kid is a good memoir, full of richly drawn characters along a story arc of self-discovery. Crabb’s San Antonio crew includes Greg, a chick magnet who also happens to be gay, and Sylvia, hard-partying queen of the Goths. When he moves to Seguin with his mom, he befriends Max, a tenderhearted punk with a dangerous habit of huffing Scotchgard. As Crabb writes in his opening Author’s Note, “I’m sorry if the drugs we took together in a spirit of youthful fun became something that damaged your life.”\nNot everyone made it out. But Bad Kid maintains a tone of mischievous optimism even through its darker moments.\nBad Kid originated as a one-man show in New York before making its way between book covers. Flip through a few pages and you realize you’re in the hands of a natural storyteller. “He has a really perfect sense of timing,” says Crabb’s editor, Laura Brown. “All of the jokes and all of the humor — you read it, you hear it the same way onstage.”\nCrabb lives in New York now, but he says he learned his storytelling chops in his native state.\n“Texans really are a people that just want to tell stories,” he says. He cites his grandma as an example: “She’ll tell you, ‘I saw Polly at the grocery store.’ I’m like, ‘Tell me about that.’ Twenty minutes later, I know how much navel oranges are, and how there’s a detour on I-35 because they closed that exit and god---- it if those cops won’t get off their … ”\nYou get the point. You can take the gay Goth out of South Texas, but the spinner of tales remains.\nPlan your life\nThe Texas Book Festival is Oct. 17-18 in Austin.
