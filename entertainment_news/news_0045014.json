He took a brief hiatus from magical performances to co-develop and manufacture novelty items that were sold to several well-known theme-parks. As the \"novelty\" wore off, Meyers decided to concentrate on his “true love” and get back to performing as a sleight of hand artist on a regular basis. \nDuring the magical hiatus, Meyers moved to Maine and was introduced to, and sat in, with some wonderful musicians. He was asked to join their group and so, in addition to solo gigs that blend his talents as a magician and musician, he performs in NEVAH, playing banjo and guitar and contributing vocals. He also performs solo gigs that blend his talents as a magician and musician. \nDoors open at 4 p.m., and the dinner is served at 6 p.m. Dinner shows are $20 per person with a set menu, which can be checked out online; admission for just the performance is $10. The inn also has a weekly Tuesday Jazz Supper Club and other events; for more information, call 505-5231 or visit belfastbreezeinn.com . \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
