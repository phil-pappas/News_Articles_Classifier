He tells SUCCESS editor Josh Ellis that it's easier to reinvent yourself and spin into an exciting new life than most people think, and there are some simple steps to make such a monumental transformation, whether it's to start a new business or chase any kind of dream.\nFor this story, Ellis and a photography team spent time with Ferriss is in his hometown of San Francisco , talking lifestyle makeovers and entrepreneurship and taking part in a rock climbing adventure emblematic of Ferriss' bold, fearless way of life. Readers can expect to find proven strategies for achieving their biggest goals sooner than they ever imagined.\n\"Reinvention comes down to asking better questions about yourself, your direction, your objectives, and also being very honest. It's something that everyone has the capacity to do, but a lot of people fear doing.\"\n-Tim Ferriss tells SUCCESS magazine, November 2015 cover story\nFerriss, who left a frustrating sales job to start his own company, then found a way to make it prosper while living a life of carefree travel in Europe , explains in the SUCCESS cover story that one of the most important things you can do is examine your fears. If you are afraid to go for broke to reach your own happiness, he explains, it's often based on the potential for a negative outcome that either isn't likely, or wouldn't be so bad anyway. The resulting realization, much of the time, is that there are no excuses.\nWho is Tim Ferriss?\nThis quest for efficiency is the underlying theme of his trio of best-sellers in the 4-Hour book series: The 4-Hour Workweek (2007), The 4-Hour Body (2010) and The 4-Hour Chef (2012). His podcast, The Tim Ferriss Show is routinely ranked as iTunes' most downloaded in the business category. In 2015 he unveiled his television series, The Tim Ferriss Experiment . Originally filmed for HLN, the show involves Ferriss attempting to master complex skills like rock 'n' roll drumming, surfing, poker, learning a new language and even approaching women in just a few short days of devoted, intense practice. The New York Times likened him to a cross between former General Electric CEO Jack Welch and a Buddhist monk, and The New Yorker called him the self-help guru for the millennial generation. \"My entire life has been focused on questioning assumptions. I've seen a lot of smart people fail when they aren't questioning assumptions.\"\n-Tim Ferriss tells SUCCESS magazine, November 2015 cover story\nWhat's Inside This Issue\nThe November 2015 issue of SUCCESS magazine, featuring Tim Ferriss, is all about reinvention-how to become the person you want to be in business and life.\nThe 10,000-Hour Theory: Does Practice Really Make Perfect?
