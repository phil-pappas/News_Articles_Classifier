My mother thought it was cute and I had to go to kindergarten feeling stifled behind one of those cheesy masks, warts and all, that covered my whole face. I put a quick end to that, and from then on, my grandmother made my costumes. \nAnd no more ugly witches; I had to be a princess all the way. Beth Spotswood, this week’s cover story author, comes from a different generation.\n“I was the suburban child of two Financial District worker bees,” she says. “No one was hand-making my costume a month in advance. My favorite childhood costume was in eighth grade, where I used a sheet as a toga, glued some leaves to a headband, and put a Boboli pizza crust on a broomstick. I was the ‘Pizza Pizza!’ guy from Little Caesars. This was Halloween ’91.”\nTo read about Halloween costumes through the decades in the Bay Area, turn to Page 14, and please add your comments about your favorite costume at www.sfchronicle.com . \nNext week: Jazz musician John Santos turns 60.\nLeba Hertz, arts and entertainment editor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:16:17.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
