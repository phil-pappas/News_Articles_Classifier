He did intend to return the costume. \nGillespie is a 23-year-old who was born in Charlotte and raised in Indian Trail, and is now employed by a plumbing company. While his claim to fame may be the costume fiasco — and this classic interview with Creative Loafing – Gillespie says his “signature move” was growing his mullet. \nHe was inspired by the flow sported by DJ Makowski, a stylist at Tribe Salon Studio in South End. They met two years ago at The Dugout , a bar in Matthews (and a fitting name considering he got in trouble for his actions committed not far from the Knights’ dugout). \nMakowski and Gillespie bumped into each other at The Dugout last weekend. Gillespie told his tale. “I was laughing,” Makowski said. “I couldn’t stop.” \nGillespie told him that he had a Best of Charlotte Party to attend Friday night at the Harvey B. Gantt Center with Creative Loafing. \n“He said he needed to get his mullet looking right,” Makowski said. \n“Frosting the tips,” Gillespie clarified. \nThough a friend originally bleached the back, he walked into Tribe Salon hoping for “straight gold.” \nHe also needed to redeem himself for the post-dragon-costume mugshot. \n“I didn’t have time to do my hair or nothing,” said Gillespie, who said he will go about work and life as usual until his November court date, at which time he will be tried for two felony charges for breaking-and-entering and larceny. \nStat: This is first mullet to ever be cut at Tribe. \nI asked Gillespie a few questions while he was getting ready for his hair styling event. \nI also asked Gillespie if people have recognized him out and about. He said no. \n“Most of the time I keep my hat on because my hair has been out of whack. When it’s freshened up I’ll let it loose.” \nThe result: \nLooking fresh. \nKatie Toussaint has never formally interviewed someone over a beer before. She liked the casual vibe.
