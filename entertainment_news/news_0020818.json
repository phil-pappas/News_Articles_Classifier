I wanted nothing to do with all that. I was going to nun school, and they were very strict. I didn't want to model. But my mom forced me. \n''I became, like huge. I had offers for TV shows and movies in Colombia, and for all these commercials. And I was like, What? I just wanted to get married to my boyfriend. That's what good Latin girls wanted back then.'' \nThe 43-year-old beauty dropped out of dental school to marry her high school boyfriend José González, with whom she has 24-year-old son Manolo, and only decided to switch from modelling to acting after they divorced in 1993 after two years of marriage. \nThe CoverGirl and Head & Shoulders spokesperson - who is engaged to Joe Manganiello - said: ''I told my manager from the beginning, if my career ever really takes off, we have to be ready. I had a plan. I knew I wanted a make-up contract, to work with companies like Pepsi, Kmart - big, big things. \n''I always wanted to have money to be able to help my family and support my son. That was my whole objective since I started work. I wanted to have a business. And then over time it became fun.''
