We check in with them decades after the release of the films.\nMichael J. Fox\nThen: In “Back to the Future Part II,” Fox returns as high school student Marty McFly . He also plays his future children, Marty Jr. and Marlene.\nNow: Fox has become a credible voice on Parkinson’s research since going public with his diagnosis in 1998. In subsequent years he retired from acting, launched what is today the world’s largest nonprofit sponsor of Parkinson’s drug development and then made his acting comeback as a newscaster in NBC’s “The Michael J. Fox Show,” which ended in 2014. He also has a recurring role on CBS’ “The Good Wife.” Fox will lend his voice to the robotic dog and star of “A.R.C.H.I.E.,” a live-action/CG hybrid kids movie coming soon.\nChristopher Lloyd\nThen: Lloyd’s nutty Doc Brown crash lands his time-traveling DeLorean into Marty McFly’s world moments after where they left off in the first “Back to the Future,” this time hurrying him — and his future wife, Jennifer — 30 years into the future.\nNow: A popular character actor, Lloyd has worked the most since the “Back to the Future” franchise ended. He’s appeared in a steady stream of movie, television and voice-over roles, including as “Reverend” Jim Ignatowski, the ex-hippie cabbie on the TV sitcom “Taxi;” Uncle Fester in “The Addams Family” movie franchise; and Professor Hargraves in the 2014 Cold War drama series “Granite Flats.” Currently, he’s the voice of the family patriarch in the stop-motion horror Web series “ House of Monsters ” and will next appear in the supernatural drama “Cold Moon.” Also, look for him in the upcoming psychological thriller “Lower Bay” opposite Rose McGowan and Michael Eklund, family drama “The Boat Builder” opposite Jane Kaczmarek and David Lascher, and supernatural thriller “I Am Not a Serial Killer” opposite Laura Fraser. “The Boat Builder” will be making its World Premiere on Nov. 6 as the opening night presentation of the 30th Ft. Lauderdale International Film Festival where Lloyd is set to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award for his career in film, television and theater. The film is also set to screen at the 38th Denver Film Festival where it is in competition for the True Grit Award for Best Colorado Produced Film.\nElisabeth Shue\nThen: Shue plays Jennifer Parker, Marty McFly’s girlfriend and future wife.\nNow: Since her days in the “Back to the Future” franchise, Shue has expanded her range. She was nominated for an Oscar for playing a prostitute in 1995’s “Leaving Las Vegas” and in 2012 joined the cast of “CSI: Crime Scenes Investigation,” leaving it just before last season’s finale. Shue occasionally turns up in big-budget films, most recently as a Mrs. Robinson-like character in 2014’s “Behaving Badly.”\nThomas F. Wilson\nThen: Wilson plays the dual-role of villainous Biff Tannen and his loose cannon of a grandson, Griff, who leads a gang of thugs.\nNow: In addition to acting, Wilson is a popular stand-up comedian, voice actor, musician, author and creator of colorful paintings featuring Rock’em Sock’em Robots, View-Master and Duncan Yo-Yo Imperial — iconic toys that he played with as a kid. He’s done voice-over work for “SpongeBob SquarePants,” “DreamWorks Dragons” and “Dragons: Race to the Edge.” He currently can be heard as the voice of Banana in the Nickelodeon animated series “Pig Goat Banana Cricket.”\nAdvertisement\nLea Thompson\nThen: Thompson returns as Lorraine Baines McFly, Marty McFly’s mom and Biff Tannen’s object of desire.\nNow: Like her co-stars, Thompson has found plenty of success outside the “Back to the Future” franchise in animation, television and film, and on Broadway. She currently stars in the ABC Family series “Switched at Birth,” which she’s also directed. She is currently making her film directorial debut in “The Year of the Spectacular Men,” which stars her daughters Madelyn Deutch and Zoey Deutch. Thompson will also appear in the film as their mother. Also, look for her next year in “Stars are Already Dead.”\nAbout the Author Reach the author at sandra.barrera@dailynews.com or follow Sandra on Twitter: @sandrabarrera18 .\nFull bio and more articles by Sandra Barrera Back to top", "external_links": ["http://mn1-laweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20151020/NEWS/151029965/AR/0/AR-151029965.jpg&maxh=400&maxw=667", "http://mn1-laweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/persbilde?Avis=LA&ID=8", "http://twitter.com/sandrabarrera18", "https://vimeo.com/ondemand/houseofmonsters", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:32:55.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
