This is the first public confirmation of a long-known and often-rumored child. \nLittle Johnny Crisstopher Sarantakos was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia when he returned with his mother to their homeland in Australia. \n“For many years, Criss has championed and raised money for various children’s charities here in Las Vegas, but he never thought it would hit this close to home,” said one of his Cirque colleagues this morning. “This is a very personal family crisis.” \nSince I’ve known Criss, he has never missed a show in more than 3,000 performances of his Luxor shows. He would have marked seven years on the Strip this Halloween. Performances resume Wednesday, Nov. 4. \nThe illusionist is said to have secretly married Johnny’s mother more than a year ago, but they broke up this summer. Criss made headlines in recent weeks being linked with former “Fantasy” topless dancer Chloe Crawford when she divorced her husband, magician Murray Sawchuck, who appears at Planet Hollywood’s Sin City Theater. \nChloe recently won raves for her own magic performances in “Britain’s Got Talent,” and it’s rumored that she’ll join Criss’s “The Supernaturalists” touring show this winter. \nRobin Leach of “Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous” fame has been a journalist for more than 50 years and has spent the past 15 years giving readers the inside scoop on Las Vegas, the world’s premier platinum playground. \nFollow Robin Leach on Twitter at Twitter.com/Robin_Leach . \nFollow Las Vegas Sun Entertainment + Luxury Senior Editor Don Chareunsy on Twitter at Twitter.com/VDLXEditorDon .
