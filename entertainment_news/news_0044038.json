Mateljan says he was also sentenced three years of probation and ordered to reimburse the city nearly $14,000 for its emergency response. \nGlover was charged with creating a false emergency, vandalism and several fireworks violations after his Aug. 9 protest high above a construction site drew a large police and fire response. \nThe 41-year-old is known for his outlandish stunts in the \"Jackass\" TV show and movies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T23:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:29:21.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
