This fall, Darling Homes will unveil this third phase, offering 69-foot and 90-foot home sites each with a variety of floor plans that stretch up to 4,400 square feet.\nSpicewood at Craig Ranch promises to be an exciting community for homebuyers looking to make McKinney their home. Darling’s distinctive villas await eager homebuyers who appreciate thoughtfully designed floor plans with the flexibility and available options to make each home unique. The homes will offer maintenance-free living and the ability to enjoy the nearby TPC Craig Ranch. And it’s all located in one of Money Magazine’s 2014 “Best Places to Live in America.”\nFurther west, Arches Point at Parkside is a new, master-planned residential community featuring an upscale amenities package including a series of lakes and pocket parks for hiking, biking and recreation. The open green spaces will include a dog park, playgrounds and wildflower-lined trails through greenbelts, along ponds and over waterways.\nWith floor plans that stretch up to 4,300 square feet, Arches Point is 10 short minutes from DFW International Airport as well as a number of major employment, shopping and entertainment areas. Students will attend schools in the highly-acclaimed Coppell Independent School District.\nAt VUE Las Colinas in Irving, Darling Homes is the exclusive builder for a community with quick access to major employment centers, premier shopping and dining, and DFW International Airport. Darling Homes will be offering a trio of distinct, luxury designs on three sizes of home sites. One of those collections, a three-story urban offering is new for the builder and is sure to impress homebuyers.\nThirty-seven of the 129 home sites offered in VUE Las Colinas are located on the TPC Four Seasons golf course and will offer three-story home designs overlooking the fairways of holes 15 and 16.\nNearby, Darling’s third phase at Main Street Coppell has just been released. The hand selected 11 home sites sit within a vibrant community that offers access to fun dining destinations like Dodi’s and Twisted Root Burger Company. Frost Cupcakery is also located in the community’s central square and a farmer’s market means you can always have fresh food in your kitchen. Homes at Main Street Coppell start from the $390,000s.\nLocated near the Shops at Highland Village, Hunters Glen, the close-knit Flower Mound community offers access to great restaurants, a movie theater, medical facilities and more. Residents will enjoy a balance between city and suburban lifestyles with easy access to major employment centers, shopping, dining, and DFW International Airport. Hunters Glen features new home designs with up to approximately 4,500 square feet on larger, 85-foot by 150-foot standard home sites, served by excellent schools in Lewisville ISD.\nFinally, the Dallas homebuilder has another Flower Mound community already generating buzz in Dallas. Buyer interest has been high for Parkside at Woodlake and its easy to see why with the community’s central location, which gives homebuyers plenty of fun to choose from including plenty of entertainment, shopping and dining destinations. Single-family homes ranging in size from approximately 2,000 to 3,500 square feet, promises to delight the area’s buyers.\nFor more information, please visit http://www.darlinghomes.com/new-homes/texas/dallas .\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13010823.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.darlinghomes.com/new-homes/texas/dallas", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13010823.htm"], "published": "2015-10-08T18:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:40:33.677+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
