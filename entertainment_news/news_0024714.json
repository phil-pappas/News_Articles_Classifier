Producers for the show will reportedly work around her absence.\nSpeaking about her struggles with the condition recently, the actress said, \"It's something a lot of women experience. When (you're told) about postpartum depression you think it's, 'I feel negative feelings towards my child, I want to injure or hurt my child' - I've never, ever had those feelings. Some women do.\n\"But you don't realize how broad of a spectrum you can really experience that on. It's something that needs to be talked about. Women need to know that they're not alone, and that it does heal.\"\nRepresentatives for Panettiere and the show have yet to comment on the news.\nSponsored Links See All Sponsored Links\nTop stories Popular Latest Videos Ken Taylor, Canadian envoy who hid Americans in residence during Iran hostage crisis, dies\n0\nRangers view Bautista's bat flip as a sign of disrespect\n0\nThe truth about Trudeau\n0\nMaple Leafs cheer on Blue Jays\n0\nNew Rob Ford tell-all details domestic fight\n0\nKen Taylor, Canadian envoy who hid Americans in residence during Iran hostage crisis, dies\n0\n'Mini Bautista' helps Blue Jays' Jose Bautista hit winning home run\n0\nTories using sex-ed as a wedge issue federally: Wynne\n0\nMom charged in teen's church beating death was too 'meek and timid' to stop it: Lawyer\n0\nB.C. man found guilty in murder of teenaged girlfriend\n0\nAndrea Christidis remembered\nWhitby Crash\nNorth Korean Yeonmi Park's View of Canadian Freedoms\nPredictions for the Jays in ALDS\nBlue Jays playoff excitement unprecedented\nMore from Home Ken Taylor, Canadian envoy who hid Americans in residence during Iran hostage crisis, dies 0\n'Mini Bautista' helps Blue Jays' Jose Bautista hit winning home run 0\nTories using sex-ed as a wedge issue federally: Wynne 0\nMom charged in teen's church beating death was too 'meek and timid' to stop it: Lawyer 0\nB.C. man found guilty in murder of teenaged girlfriend 0\nInside Toronto sun.com News\nFormer diplomat Ken Taylor dead 0", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228633661&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:53:08.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
