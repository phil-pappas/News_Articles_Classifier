A lot of things are coming to the gaming world including the arrival of \"Street Fighter 5\" which is said to bring some changes. In a report by Cinema Blend , it mentioned that the game franchise has been struggling with its storyline. Capcom has not been very particular with that area in the previous games. But with the upcoming version, they're planning to change that one. According to Game Spot , producer Matt Dahlgren said in an interview with HipHop Gamer that they are going to make some changes with how they deliver their story. \n\"I can't reveal specifics on our story, but I can say we are going to be doing things differently this time around. We're definitely paying attention to what our competitors are doing and want to raise the bar.\" \nDahlgren referred to \"Mortal Kombat\" and \"Mortal Kombat X\" which both delivered a cinematic approach to storytelling. He also went on to say that this time around, they will give fans a story content that is going to be \"unique and different\" compared to how it was from the previous \"Street Fighter\" games. \nIn other news, creator Yoshinori Ono appeared at the series' New York Comic Con panel. Polygon reported that he didn't come to introduce another character, instead he did surprise the crowd by discussing on \"the possible expansion of a role\" for the classic fighter Alex. The character is not part of the new game's official roster but it will be having a minor, non-playable role in the game. But Ono told the audience through a translator that he will do what he can do to expand his appearance in the game. \nThe latest character revealed to be part of the game is Laura, the Brazilian jiu-jitsu master, and Zangief, who possesses the Iron Muscle power. \"Street Fighter 5\" is set to arrive in 2016 while the second beta test will take place on Oct. 22.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:28:21.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
