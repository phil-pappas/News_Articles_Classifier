Easley/AP Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis is suing Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear contending that his request that she follow a nation-wide ruling in favor of same-sex marriage violated on her Christian faith. Kentucky clerk Kim Davis’ lawsuit against the state and the governor is “absurd” and “forlorn,” defense attorneys said.\nLawyers for Gov. Steve Beshear asked a judge Tuesday to toss the Rowan County Clerk’s case, which claims the governor violated Davis’ religious freedom when he asked the elected official to do her job.\n“Simply stated, Davis' role is a legal one — not a moral or religious one,” the lawyers’ statement read.\nDavis — who spent five days in jail for defying federal court orders to issue marriage licenses to gay couples and recently met with Pope Francis, who commended her “courage” — filed the suit in August, contending that Beshear’s order that his clerks follow the nation-wide ruling infringed on her Apostolic Christian faith.\nKENTUCKY CLERK KIM DAVIS BLAMES GOV. STEVE BESHEAR FOR LEGAL WOES\nBeshear's lawyer, Palmer G. Vance, described Davis' continued legal battle as a “meritless assault on the rule of law.” Even if Beshear had not instructed clerks to follow the law, the Supreme Court and subsequent court orders required her to do so, he wrote.\nAfter the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage in June, Beshear sent a letter to the state's 120 county clerks explaining how Kentucky intended to comply. The state's marriage license template would soon be updated to remove gender references, he explained.\n“Neither your oath nor the Supreme Court dictates what you must believe. But as elected officials, they do prescribe how we must act,” he wrote in the letter.\nTWITTER BLASTS POPE FRANCIS OVER MEETING WITH KENTUCKY CLERK KIM DAVIS\nIn her suit, Davis claimed the governor’s note “commandeered” her office “usurped control of Kentucky marriage law.” The order “specifically (targeted) clerks like Davis who possess certain religious beliefs about marriage,” she and her lawyers claimed.\nTimothy D. Easley/AP Lawyers for Gov. Steve Beshear (pictured) called Davis' suit \"absurd.\" Davis, an elected Democrat who switched to the Republican Party in the midst of the controversy , claimed offering marriage licenses to gay couples was against “God’s authority.” Her office stopped giving licenses to any couple, gay or straight, soon after the summer Supreme Court decision.\nAfter four couples sued her, she ignored a series of federal court orders, continued turning couples away and spent five nights in jail for her defiance.\nKENTUCKY CLERK KIM DAVIS SAYS GOD IS HER BOSS\nAs the clerk sat behind bars, Davis' deputies began issuing licenses. The judge released her with strict instructions not to interfere.\nAs soon as she got out, she altered the licenses, replacing her name and office with the phrase, “pursuant to federal court order.”\nLast week, Davis met with Pope Francis as he visited Washington, D.C. She wore her signature long, straight hair in a different style and took an SUV to the covert meeting at the Vatican embassy.\nThe Pope, who requested the quick conference, thanked the clerk for “her courage,” Davis said.\n“I was crying. I had tears coming out of my eyes,\" Davis said of the meeting. The Pontiff gave her and her fourth husband blessed rosaries, which she said she plans to give to her Catholic parents.\nWith News Wire Services\nmwagner@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories Vatican confirms Pope Francis meeting with Kim Davis Defiant Kim Davis is willing to go back to jail Kim Davis is the subject in a new erotic novel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T18:57:53.929+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
