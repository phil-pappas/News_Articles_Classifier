Hicap\nOctober 2, 2015 (Clockwise from top left) SHINee, TVXQ, Infinite, Seo Taiji and Boys and Big Bang (Photos from official Facebook pages and screen grab fromYouTube)\nFive K-pop boy band songs and one Japanese band song made it to Rolling Stone’s “50 Greatest Boy Band Songs of All Time” list.\nRolling Stone explained the list “is a plethora of sugary delights from Eighties malls, Nineties ‘Total Request Live’ playlists, contemporary ‘X Factor seasons, our Korean pop future and more.”\nJoining Jackson 5, Backstreet Boys, ‘N Sync, New Kids on the Block, One Direction and New Edition on the list are K-pop acts SHINee, Big Bang, TVXQ, Seo Taiji and Boys and Infinite, and Japanese band Kat-tun.\nSHINee’s 2012 hit “Sherlock” is ranked 12th, the highest position for their ilk on the list. The song is described by Rolling Stone as a “Jackson 5-recalling tune (that) shows how innovative and experimental K-pop can get…”\nBig Bang’s “Fantastic Baby,” released in 2012, is at No. 22.\n“This instantly accessible single from K-Pop phenomenon Big Bang blew off many doors of American crossover with little effort on the band’s part,” said Rolling Stone.\n“Mirotic,” ranked 31st and released by the then five-member TVXQ in 2008, is, according to the magazine, a “fizzy electro-pop cut” which “helped the band’s ‘Mirotic’ LP win at that year’s Golden Disc Awards, Korea’s closest equivalent to the Grammys.”\nSeo Taiji and Boys, one of the original Korean boy bands who became popular in the ’90s, is “credited for helming the shiny, explosive, fabulously pre-fab Korean pop scene that we know today, kicking everything off with their game-changing 1992 debut single, ‘Nan Arayo (‘I Know’).’”\nRanked at No. 36, Rolling Stone said the song, “blended then-trendy American new jack swing with Korean lyrics to tremendous success, spawning a wave of similarly sounding boy bands and girl groups and establishing the scene’s still-strong affection for multi-member outfits as opposed to solo acts.”\nInfinite’s 2012 song “The Chaser” is at No. 42.\n“Not only a crown jewel in the discography of famously in-sync K-pop septet Infinite, but ‘The Chaser’ is also the masterpiece of Sweetune, the production duo renowned for giving the genre a retro kick,” Rolling Stone said.\nThe only Japanese act on the list is Kat-Tun, whose “Real Face” is ranked No. 44.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:47:00.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
