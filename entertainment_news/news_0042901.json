Game content normally includes different races/classes of characters, quests or missions, player-vs-environment (PvE) combat, player-vs-player (PvP) battles, and community content like guilds and factions.\n\"Typically, MMORPGs take three or more years to develop. This means that it is mostly big-name game developers that tackle this genre. However, gamers and industry watchers will be in for a few surprises since there are actually a few small, indie developers that are poised to release some very innovative new MMO games in 2016,\" said Stokes.\nThe main website at Bestmmorpg2016.com offers gamers a more detailed look at upcoming games. Currently, ten titles are featured. All of the upcoming games are still under development but some of them already have early access or closed and open beta versions available.\nFor more information, visit http://bestmmorpg2016.com .\nAbout Bestmmorpg2016.com\nBestmmorpg2016.com is a leading MMORPG review and opinion website that offers a fresh and new perspective to current news about the MMO game industry.
