By Rashmi Mishra on October 3, 2015 at 8:24 AM Comments With the release of much awaited trailer of Salman Khan’s upcoming Diwali release Prem Ratan Dhan Payo , we have an ecstatic group of audiences on one hand and critical view of movie analysts on the other. This magnum opus movie is special in many ways like Salman Khan returns as Prem in Sooraj Barjatya movie but the most important element that has caught everyone’s eyes is Salman Khan’s romance with Sonam Kapoor as Prem drawing similarities with his loving act as Sameer with Aishwarya Rai Bachchan in Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s classic romance Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. When the first poster of Prem Ratan Dhan Payo was released on September 29, with Salman Khan standing alone in the picture marking the return of his iconic character Prem, it gave an impression of yet another hero-centric movie just like most of Salman Khan movies. But with the release of second poster that had gorgeous Sonam Kapoor and later with the trailer being released, the audiences can be rest assured Prem Ratan Dhan Payo to be full-fledged romantic tale. Sooraj Barjatya is known to make emotional, heart-warming family entertainers along with the epic love stories. So what is it going to be like when the super successful actor-director duo work after a gap of 16 years? We expect nothing less than magic. Pure magic. But why is there the talks of the comparison of Salman Khan and Sonam Kapoor’s chemistry with the cult status gained pair of Salman with his then girlfriend Aishwarya Rai in Bhansali’s Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam ? The reasons seem pretty obvious, right from the first poster to song and dance sequence to the love scenes, Sonam Kapoor will remind you of ravishing Aishwarya Rai from Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s masterpiece. The colourful dressing to going with same netted glittering blue dress, Sonam will remind you of Chand Chupa Badal Mein song. The similarities between the two movies could be mere co-incidence but it will be quite interesting to watch if Salman Khan can better his romantic story with Sonam Kapoor than what he did with Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. \n  8:24 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T05:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:03:04.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
