His next will be no different; it is set in the backdrop of 1971 Indo-Pakistani war, and will have Mohanlal in the lead.\nThe movie will be the fourth in the director's 'Major Mahadevan' series featuring Mohanlal, after Keerthi Chakra, Kurukshetra and Kandahar , making it the only second such quadrilogy in M-Town after Mammootty's CBI Sethurama Iyer series.\nMajor Ravi tells us that his film will have Mohanlal in three different roles, though he is willing to reveal only one of them as of now. \"He will be playing Colonel Mahadevan. The rest will be revealed later on.\"\nThe director adds that the film will be similar to his last venture, Picket 43 . \"The focus will be on the individuals rather than the war, and will portray the relationships that are forged during the war.\"\nQuiz him on why his films focus on friendships between soldiers posted on either side of the border, and Major Ravi says, \"In a war, the soldier on the other side is your enemy. But that person is also fighting for his country and is a hero for them. I want to show that side of soldiers too.\"\nThe director informs us that he's got plans to cast a Bollywood actor for the role of a Pakistani officer, which has equal importance as Mohanlal's lead character. Incidentally, it was Javed Jaffrey who was cast alongside Prithviraj in the role of a Pakistani soldier in Picket 43 .\nThough the film might not be a full-blown war movie, it will have a few tank battle sequences too, Major Ravi adds. Currently, he is busy finishing the script of the movie, which he plans to begin filming by February next year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T14:37:50.991+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
