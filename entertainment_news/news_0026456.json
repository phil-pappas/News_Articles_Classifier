(Hannah McKay/PA) \nThe 25-year-old has racked up an impressive 39 million subscribers and 10 billion views on his YouTube channel, making him a pretty famous face on the wonderful world of the internet. \nSo it’s not exactly surprising that the crowd outside Waterstones bookshop in Piccadilly, central London, was so big that people were moved inside early to meet the star. (Hannah McKay/PA) \nFelix’s funny gaming videos, vlogs and LOL-worthy montages have won him fans both young and old. Antonio Rogers, 12, had been chosen to be at the front of the queue with his father, and was waiting next to teenagers who said they arrived five hours early to meet the Swedish gamer. \nAntonio said: “I love PewDiePie so much. He always makes me laugh when I’m bored and smile when I’m sad. He’s amazing.” Promoted stories \nLee Rogers, 24, from Kent, added: “I have been watching his content for years so I want to meet the guy. He makes me laugh. I am a bit of a gamer myself but I don’t have time to do it any more so I watch him.” \nAnd of course, everyone was keen to take an all-important selfie with the man himself. @pewdiepie I hope our story made you feel all the feels and pulled your heart strings! 👋🏻 I say hello back👬 pic.twitter.com/0VlvVAurAa", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T00:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T01:51:11.099+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
