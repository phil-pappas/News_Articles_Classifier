First up is Bela Lugosi’s definitive portrayal of the dark prince, shot by horror master Tod Browning at Universal Studios by day, and George Melford’s Spanish version shot at night, using the same sets (a common practice in the first few years of talkies). Starring Spanish-born actor Carlos Villarias as Count Dracula, many fans consider this the better version for two main reasons: The camerawork is more inventive (some think that’s because Melford had the advantage of watching the English-language version’s dailies), and there’s an aura of sexuality missing from the Lugosi version (for one thing, the women are dressed more provocatively). The double feature is presented by Turner Classic Movies and Universal and is playing in theaters across the country, including about 20 in the Bay Area, at 2 and 7 p.m. Sunday, Oct. 25, and Wednesday, Oct. 28. In San Francisco, it will screen at the Century San Francisco Centre 9 and AMC Van Ness 14. www.fathomevents.com/event/dracula-double-feature. \nJapanese horror week: The Roxie is counting down to Halloween with five selections from the golden era of J-Horror — 1989 to 2005 — playing multiple times over a seven-day period. What’s great is each film is a terrific example of some of the true masters of the form: the rebellious genre-buster Miike Takashi (1999’s “Audition,” which gives a new definition to being piano-wired); Sion Sono (2005’s “Noriko’s Dinner Table” — a five-chapter thematic sequel to his audacious “Suicide Club”); Shinya Tsukamoto (the raw, David Lynch-inspired 1989 bit of twisted metal known as “Tetsuo: The Iron Man”); the versatile Kiyoshi Kurosawa, a maker of everything, including family dramas such as “Tokyo Sonata” (here he’s represented by the chilling “Kairo,” a.k.a. “Pulse”); and Takashi Shimizu (the original 2002 “Ju-On: The Grudge”). Ahh, they don’t make ’em like these anymore. My only complaint: no Hideo Nakata (“Ringu”). Sunday, Oct. 25, through Saturday, Oct. 31, at the Roxie Theater, 3117 16th St. S.F. (415) 863-1087. www.roxie.com. \n“My Fair Lady”: A 50th anniversary screening (but wait, isn’t it 51?) of the 1964 best picture winner features a new 4K transfer, which is a most loverly development indeed. Although it became one of Audrey Hepburn’s great successes, it arrived in 1964 with a bit of controversy, in that Julie Andrews, who originated the role on Broadway with Rex Harrison (who stars in the film), was passed over. And Hepburn’s singing voice was dubbed by the great Marni Nixon, something that would have not been necessary had Andrews gotten the role. Yet Andrews got the title role in “Mary Poppins” instead, beat out Hepburn for best actress, Hepburn’s film beat out Andrews’ for best picture and everyone was happy, no grudges held. 10 a.m. Saturday, Oct. 24, at the Rialto Cinemas Cerrito, 10070 San Pablo Ave., El Cerrito. (510) 273-9102. www.rialtocinemas.com. \nAlexander Valley Film Festival: Sonoma County’s latest film festival, the four-day inaugural event isn’t just films, but also food, wine, music and other forms of cultural good times.
