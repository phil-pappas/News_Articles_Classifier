The crew spent three years training wolves for the movie. \nChina Film News said it has been replaced by \"Go Away Mr. Tumor,\" a romantic comedy about an optimistic woman coping with cancer. \nThe last Chinese submission to be nominated for best foreign language film was Zhang Yimou's 2002 film \"Hero.\" Copyright The Associated Press Sign up for our FOX23 News This Morning Newsletter Sign Up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T17:13:33.642+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
