The resolution was, [the gunman] said, 'Oh, sorry,' and then he went to the appropriate person behind the register who gave him the money, and he left the store running before the police got there.\"\nThe comment garnered widespread attention in national media, and some questioned whether the story was true.\nOn Thursday, Armstrong Williams, Carson's business manager, told The Sun he's heard Carson tell the story of the robbery for at least 10 years.\nHe said the robbery occurred between 1980 and 1983, and that Carson doesn't believe police were called or took a report.\n\"There's no question that it happened,\" Williams said. \"Obviously, if there’s no police report it would be shocking if they could find one. With all the problems going on in Baltimore, I don't know why anyone would waste their time on this.\"\nTJ Smith, a spokesman for the police department, said the police department is not trying to debunk Carson's statement. It's merely responding to media requests.\n\"We’re not saying it did or didn’t happen,\" Smith said. \"We can’t find a report based on the information we’ve gathered. It absolutely could have happened. We just don’t have the information to get that report.\"\nlbroadwater@baltsun.com\nTwitter.com/lukebroadwater\n Ben Carson Johns Hopkins Hospital", "external_links": ["http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/blog/bs-md-carson-popeyes-20151008-story.html", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56202804/turbine/bal-baltimore-police-say-they-cant-confirm-or-debunk-dr-ben-carsons-popeyes-robbery-story-20151015-thumbnail", "http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/ben-carson/"], "published": "2015-10-15T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:02:41.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
