And it has now started to take shape at the site on Castle Hill. \nIt features some of the zoo’s best-known species across all sections including big cats, reptiles, birds and primates. Among the animals showcased in the work are meerkats, a kangaroo, a lion and a tiger. It is due for completion in the next couple of weeks. \nMr Edwards, aged 41, said he had enjoyed being involved with the project.

Be the first to comment \nTo prepare for the project Mr Edwards spent at day at the zoo sketching out the animals he wanted to depict in the mural. He started working on the piece a couple of weeks ago. \nMr Edwards was commissioned to create the work by borough artist Steve Field. European funding as part of the area regeneration project has paid for the work. Mr Field said: “Steve is a particularly talented artist and is quite a discovery. “He uses spray cans and it is astonishing how quickly he works. The mural does look very impressive.” Receive daily email updates from the Express & Star \nWe'll send a morning digest of the day's biggest news and sport stories straight to your inbox.
