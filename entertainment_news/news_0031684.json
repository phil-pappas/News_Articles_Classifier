They are not the least bit subtle but there is way more to this play than its humour. \n“It has some powerful insights into the way we perceive people of a different race or culture. \n“We make so many assumptions about people because of the way they look and this play really tears down those perceptions.” \nIglesias says that, as a director, he is never satisfied “with simply putting a play on stage. \n“I try to find something unique to bring to the script and the production. I always want to put a personal stamp on a show.” \nIn the case of Ching Chong Chinaman, Iglesias wanted to “take a really ethnic play and ethnic cast and then erase that part of the equation as best I could. \n“I am putting the whole show in blacks and whites from the sets to the costumes and props. Hopefully it will look like a comic book or graphic novel. \n“I needed a set designer with an incredible imagination so I went to JP Thibodeau and what he has given me is a kind of surreal setting for the characters because the way this family live their lives borders on fantasy.” \nWhat Thibodeau has done that really excites Iglesias is “he’s made the props either really big or really small and then he’s snuck just the hint of colour into some of them.” \nIglesias stresses his cast, which includes Ali Deregt, Devin Kotani, Grace Lu, Conni Mah, Ben Wong and Kida Nakamura ,“were all completely behind what I was trying to do and say with the show. \n“I couldn’t have done it without their complete support because we’re all taking some huge chances.” Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T02:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:54:18.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
