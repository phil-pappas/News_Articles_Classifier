Mike Fletcher will teach the basics of black and white photography in a six-week class held on Mondays from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. beginning Oct. 26. Fletcher is an accomplished photographer and believes that there is no better introduction to the fine art of photography than learning to shoot, process and print black and white photographs from film. \n“Making photographs is all about the process; slowing down with this older technology opens up new creative possibilities,” he said. \nAlthough physical darkrooms are considered old school, they are regaining popularity due to the meditative process and the unique look of photographs done this traditional, magical way. To register for the class or to make inquiries, call the office or stop by. \nWaterfall Arts’ galleries and print and clay studios also will be open for visitors during the Fourth Friday Art Walk, and some of the resident artists will have their studios open, as well. For more information, visit waterfallarts.org ; stop by; or call 338-2222. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
