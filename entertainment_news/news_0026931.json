Several Main Street businesses are sponsoring a Harry Potter festival from 6-9 p.m. Thursday. The event actually starts at 4 p.m., when the Wanee Theater will start free showings of Harry Potter movies. There will be a costume contest, with prizes for the best entries. A jump house will be set up in the parking lot at Century 21 Sutton and Associates at First and Main streets. Face painting will be offered at Hair Essentials at Third and Main. Uncle Bud’s Cider Slush will be available, and a Bishop Hill broom maker will be on hand to supply the needs of any would-be witches. Heartfelt Gifts will offer fudge, and there will be wands, and potions to drink.
