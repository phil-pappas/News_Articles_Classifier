There's no way to change other than massive cuts.\"\nThe outsourcing request for information raised concern with the group of union custodians and other workers who attended the meeting.\n\"We weren't notified yet again,\" said Shea Marshall, who represents Local 73 of the Service Workers International Union.\n\"These people have turned out for you all these years, and all we ask is the olive branch be extended back, but it never is. ... We want to help you through this.\"\nSuperintendent Cheryl Pruitt responded that a $1.48 million insurance hasn't been paid and that it could be cut off. She said building, grounds and maintenance also has about $4.9 million in unpaid bills and that salaries run about $6 million.\nBoard member Marion Williams said the outsourcing plan should be discussed in detail and that the union should be involved.\n\"We've had two or three audits,\" Pruitt said. \"Many have indicated we weren't supposed to make payroll after 2012. At this point, we are attempting very hard to make sure we provide an educational service in this community.\"\nUnder state legislation, the school district is being assisted by the Distressed Unit Appeals Board that hired Martin to resolve the district's nagging financial debts, estimated at $80 million to $90 million. The district is seeking approval from the DUAB for a $15 million state loan.\nccarlson@post-trib.com\nTwitter @ccwriterPT\nCopyright Â© 2015, Post-Tribune", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5616febd/turbine/ct-ptb-gary-schools-art-st-1009-20151008"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:45:31.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
