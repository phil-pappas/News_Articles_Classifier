(Of course, Allen passed the donation to the Wayside mission’s gallery.) \n“Everyone stood up before I was even finished announcing her,” said Milliken with a tone of surprise in his voice. \nAllen, 84, said even she was a bit stunned when he made the announcement. \n“When I came in I was coming from another event – an alumni event at Spalding University,” she said. “Then they said something about an award.” \nAldy Milliken, Kentucky Museum of Art and Craft executive director and chief curator, with Elmer Lucille Allen announcing her as the organization's first Art and Advocacy Award winner at its Bourbon Bash.

In 2011, she received the Spalding University Caritas Medal, the highest honor award to an alumnae, and the previous year, the University of Louisville Saturday Academy outreach initiative honored her for inspiring women at its “Sistah Summit.” \nBut not many people know about other responsibilities she has taken on, such as helping care for her 94-year-old aunt and recently helping the family of a long-time friend, Dr. Joyce Howell Young, when she was hospitalized and died in September. Young and Allen had become friends after Young, a pediatrician, moved with her husband to Louisville to set up a practice out of their home. \n“We lived within walking distance from each other near Chickasaw Park,” said Allen, who mentioned that Young had been an amateur photographer for years. “She had never shown her photography before. Her first show she was scheduled to have opened at the gallery in October 2016.” \nIn telling this story, Allen’s voice didn’t grow heavy. Instead, it sparked with warm feelings for her friend. Sculptures made of bullets, textile art and more \nThere are many stories of Allen’s warmth and generosity. Artist Ed Hamilton talked of him and his wife bonding in the early 1970s with Allen and her husband, Ray, who died in 1986. \n“The woman is a renaissance woman,” Hamilton said of Allen. “She helps anyone who needs help and is just a walking book of knowledge. We absolutely love and adore her.” \nWeaving art into life, community \nBy middle age, Allen worked as a chemist for the Brown-Forman Corp, while she and Ray were raising a daughter and two sons. That's when she began taking ceramics classes at various places, including Metro Art Center on Dixie Highway, where her teachers included artists Melvin Rowe and Laura Ross. \nIn 1981, at Ross's suggestion, she took her first art class at U of L and has been a perpetual student ever since – even though she earned her Master of Arts degree in studio arts in 2002. \nDuring the early ‘80s, Allen turned her involvement in arts-related endeavors up a notch after hearing about the Renaissance Development Corporation, headed by Ken Clay. It was promoting black art and culture throughout state. Allen jumped on board and organized conferences in Louisville and Lexington and helped oversee the organization of African-American artists. \nThat organization put Allen in touch with artists and administrators across the state, which helped her efforts to get the Kentucky Center for the Arts built. Before it opened in 1983, citizens outside of Louisville saw the center as a Louisville-specific project. So, Allen accompanied the center’s first director, Marlow Burt, on trips around the state to help change that idea. \nJudi Jennings, who worked at Appalshop in Whitesburg, said Allen impressed her and her colleagues. \n“She has strong opinions and expresses them,” said Jennings, also the former Kentucky Foundation for Women director. “She believes that everyone should contribute to the arts financially, and I’ve heard her say that many times.” Buy Photo \nElmer Lucille Allen was recently awarded the Kentucky Museum of Arts and Craft's first Art and Advocacy Award.

He particularly recalled Allen’s keen attention to other students’ work during critiques.

If she did not like something or saw something that could be better, she offered thoughtful and considerate comments.” \nBack then, Levy periodically saw articles about Allen in the newspaper that mentioned her career as a chemist. \n“It blew me away, but then her work made more sense to me because it is so meticulous and well thought out. It reflects the mind of a scientist,” Levy said. \nAllen as Artist \nAfrican-American symbols and images are part of Allen’s ceramic and textile work. She has created porcelain cubes coated in celadon glaze that work as installation pieces situated on the floor, but in recent years has created other kinds of vessels with pattering including teapots. \nHer textile work employs shibori, a complex dying technique developed in Japan that involves tightly stitching the cloth before dying to create patterns. She creates most of her textile pieces in her studio at the Mellwood Arts Center, where she has a studio. \n“She is so exceptional. You can see the commitment in her work, which uses time-consuming processes,” said Gordon, her former fibers professor. \nAllen’s art and community work has even impressed other U of L faculty members, most recently artist and U of L assistant professor of photography Mary Carothers. The artist recently created a public art piece for Louisville’s “Connect/Disconnect” exhibit on the riverfront through November. Among the many ceramic pieces in Carothers’ “Beneath the Surface” are knobs shaped from Allen’s hair bun.

She’s always been an upbeat person and was always helping us,” Patterson-Wetherill said. \nThat idea of helping people is one of the driving forces behind the artwork at Wayside Christian Mission, where Allen works. \n“When our folks go in the gallery and see what people have done often while struggling with their own situations, they are inspired,\" said chief operating officer Nina Mosely. \nWhen asked about all the work Allen does, she shrugs it off, choosing instead to let the question wash over her. \n“My work has always just been something that I do,” Allen said. \nReach reporter Elizabeth Kramer at (502) 582-4682 and ekramer@courier-journal.com.
