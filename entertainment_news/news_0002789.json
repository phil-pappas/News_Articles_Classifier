But let's assume the Constitution has a hidden \"Mean Girls\" clause somewhere, what would a Lohan presidency look like? (Video via OWN , Paramount Pictures / 'Mean Girls' ) \nWell –– first of all, it's pretty hard to find out which side of the aisle she's on, based on her flip-flopping presidential endorsements. (Video via OWN ) \nIn 2008, Lohan made it clear she was all about then-Senator Obama moving into The White House on her MySpace . (Remember MySpace?) But in 2012, she told reporters \"I think unemployment is very important for now, so as of now (my vote) is Mitt Romney.\" (Video via C-SPAN , ABC ) \nBut, we at least know Lilo's stance on a couple of our most divisive issues. First –– she's all about tax cuts. For everybody. \nWhen President Obama tweeted about cutting taxes for small businesses and the middle class she quickly replied \"we also need to cut them for those that are listed on Forbes as 'millionaires' if they are not, you must consider that as well.\" (Video via Obama for America ) \nAnd it would seem Lohan would keep fighting for marriage equality and LGBT rights if she moves in to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. (Video via NBC ) \nShe told Access Hollywood in 2008 , \"I feel like you're going to live in a place where you're going to spend more taxes, you should have the same rights as everyone else.\" \nEven if Lohan won't be old enough to take the top job, don't count her out yet. Maybe President Yeezy will throw her on his cabinet –– right next Kim K. \nThis video includes images from Getty Images.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T07:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:46:22.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
