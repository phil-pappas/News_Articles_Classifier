(Thibault Camus/AP) \nThe 27-year-old draped herself in this oversize salmon pink coatdress from this year’s Fall collection from Dior and paired it with knee-high PVC boots for the show at Louvre Palace. \nAnyone else may have got lost in this tent-like dress, but the Diamonds singer looked stunning in the Dior number that featured an oversize pocket and a full-length fur cape sleeve on the left side. (Thibault Camus/AP) \nThe right side of her dress was open – allowing Rihanna to show off her toned limbs. \nThe dress also featured a draped neckline – made from tweed which slipped subtly off her right shoulder. (Thibault Camus/AP) \nThe singer brought a bit of edginess to her look with a beautiful blue snakeskin clutch-style handbag and her shiny PVC boots with see-through heels. (Thibault Camus/AP) \nThe Bajan singer finished her look with with a pair of green earrings, an understated necklace and a chunky gemstone ring that complimented the stacks of rings on her fingers. \nRihanna styled her hair into an updo that looked simply perfect, while her make-up was more on the au natural side – with a hint of colour on her eyes and lips. (Thibault Camus/AP) \nThe singer looked like she was in good spirits as she posed with Dior’s CEO Sidney Toledano. (Thibault Camus/AP) \nAnd if Rihanna’s Dior dress got you all inspired for blush pink coats, here are a few you can buy asap from the high street and for under a 100 quid. \n1.
