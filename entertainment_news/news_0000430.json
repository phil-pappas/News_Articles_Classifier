Biel was accompanied by husband Justin Timberlake to the event, which honored rising fashion stars.\nDimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images Jessica looked elegant in a form-fitting tea pencil dress that accentuated her slim physique. Biel's weight loss secret is an organic Paleo-inspired diet, she said on Twitter.\nBiel credited Paleta, a farm-to-table meal delivery service, for her rapid weight loss after giving birth to son Silas in April 2015. \"Thank you ‪@eatpaleta for making my life easy & delicious,\" Biel tweeted . \"3 meals & snacks at my doorstep? Yes pls.\"\nBiel maintains her toned bikini body with CrossFit workouts, yoga, sprints and weightlifting. The athletic Jessica has always been outdoorsy and enthusiastic about fitness.\nFor cardio exercise, Biel usually jogs for a half-mile and then does sprint intervals of 100-meter, 200-meter and 400-meter sprints. Jessica also lifts weights (using light weights at high repetitions) to keep her muscles lean.\n\"I’ve always been physical,\" said Biel, 33. \"I have no concept of what life is like without physical activity.\"\nJessica embraces an organic Paleo-style diet that limits processed foods. “Fermented veggies and probiotics are also great for my skin and digestion,\" said Biel. \"You can also buy shredded fermented vegetables at a health-food store and sprinkle them over a salad or even eggs in the morning.\"\nOther celebrities who follow the Paleo diet and do CrossFit include Jessica Alba, Kellan Lutz and Joe Manganiello, Celebrity Health & Fitness reported. Similarly, singer Tim McGraw lost 40 pounds and got rippling 8-pack abs with a low-carb Paleo diet and CrossFit workouts.\nBiel doesn't believe in starvation diets, and says portion control is her No. 1 weight loss secret. \"Eat things you like, but in smaller portions,\" said Jessica. \"I always cut things in half and send half back. Do I eat dessert? If there's something I want to try, then I try it. But I have a bite, not the whole thing.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.celebrityhealthfitness.com/20587/crossfit-plus-paleo-hollywoods-new-fitness-secret/", "https://twitter.com/jessicabiel/status/460835104387248128"], "published": "2015-10-23T14:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:52:27.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
