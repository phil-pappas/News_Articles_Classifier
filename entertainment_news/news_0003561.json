The former \"Degrassi\" star talked about his desire to return to acting in an interview for his cover story of W Art magazine's newest edition. \"I can't wait to get back into acting,\" so the rapper said. \"No one ever asks me to do movies, and, although music is my focal point now, I'd love to do a film. That was the life that I lived before, and it would be interesting to live it again.\" A photo posted by W magazine (@wmag) on Oct 15, 2015 at 5:33am PDT Drake also explained the \"I signed up for greatness\" note that he tweeted amid his feud with Meek Mill . \"Realizing that I had a larger purpose was one of the most comforting, peaceful feelings,\" he said. \"With music, especially, I've come to the conclusion that I'm a vessel to deliver emotion to people.\" \"I want to provide the background music to your life as you live it. I'm there for you in heartbreak and tragedy and joy. The thought of being remembered is what keeps me going.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Drake News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:23:10.299+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
