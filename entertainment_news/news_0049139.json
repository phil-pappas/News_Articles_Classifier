He's scheduled to appear before the country's Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) on Thursday.\nQuaid famously fled the United States in 2010, claiming he and his Canadian wife Evi were being targeted by \"Hollywood star-whackers.\" He was denied permanent residency status in 2012, but his wife was granted citizenship that year; the couple has reportedly lived in Vancouver, Toronto and Ottawa before staying in Montreal the past two years.\nThe CBC reports the actor, also known for roles in \"Independence Day,\" \"Brokeback Mountain\" and \"Kingpin,\" was last arrested in April over an outstanding warrant from a missed IRB interview in 2013.\n\"I hate the sexist pigs and corrupt gov of Canada and renounce the crap citizenship I was given in 2010,\" Evi Quaid wrote on Twitter early Wednesday. \"i love that Canada needs to learn how to wake up and criticize its crappy government ps we got arrested by an actual tall midget.\"\nThe couple's legal troubles in the U.S. are believed to be the reason why Randy Quaid's immigration application has been denied. The pair skipped numerous court hearings after being accused of defrauding an innkeeper in California and suspected of burglary at their former house.\nIn 2012, U.S. officials refused to seek extradition on felony vandalism charges, but authorities in Santa Barbara said they'd have the couple arrested if they return to America.\nI hate the sexist pigs and corrupt gov of Canada and renounce the crap citizenship I was given in 2010 pic.twitter.com/ykWJ0pBfxm\n— Evi Quaid (@EviQuaid) October 7, 2015 Randy Quaid pic.twitter.com/zhRTKQw5Fc\n— Evi Quaid (@EviQuaid) October 7, 2015", "external_links": ["http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/randy-quaid-arrested-again-in-montreal-1.3260479", "http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/us-actor-randy-quaid-arrested-again-in-montreal/article26700710/", "http://t.co/ykWJ0pBfxm", "http://t.co/zhRTKQw5Fc", "https://twitter.com/EviQuaid/status/651694180058693632", "https://twitter.com/EviQuaid/status/651712846254985217"], "published": "2015-10-08T01:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T21:13:24.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
