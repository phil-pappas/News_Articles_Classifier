The IRFU's insistence on releasing the team via their Twitter handles means we've gone and wrote out the side underneath for those of your not up-to-date on the entire side's social media pages. We're sound like that.\nHere's the @IrishRugby v Italy. Welcome back @henshawrob #ShoulderToShoulder #RWC2015 pic.twitter.com/ToouiXkWAB\n— Irish Rugby (@IrishRugby) October 2, 2015\nForwards:\n1.
