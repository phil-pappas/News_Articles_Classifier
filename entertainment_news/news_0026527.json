Oh-em-gee! Yes, be prepared to get this reaction if you’re ever asked “the” question about Republic and your answer is a negative. The Republic, as most call it, is a bar-cum-restaurant located in Osu at 3rd Lane off Oxford Street and offers an incredible experience fused with art, music, good affordable food and drinks and cool people (well, mostly). \nThe Republic Bar & Grill has become the place to hangout in Accra; you must hang out there at least once if you’re only visiting Ghana, and if you live in the city and have never checked it out, you are totally missing out. Some of the things that make this bar/ restaurant highly appealing to people are its ambiance – indoor vintage setting rooted in Ghanaian/African history and the display of cultural elements, the down-to-earth attitude of its staff and their good service, reasonably priced tasty food and drinks as well as its seamless integration into the local environs with an inviting outdoor seating. Also, at The Republic, you’re guaranteed great music played by some of Accra’s skilled DJs and some really good live performances by local artists. And they serve a selection of local drinks including fresh palm wine and a great variety of cocktails (virgin and alcoholic). \nOh, and their new weekend breakfast schedule (10am – 2pm) offering menu options including Moroccan omelet and Moroccan tea which we tried (see image here ), jollof breakfast, chicken quesadillas and more is pretty cool. Prices range from GHS5 to GHS30. \nHaven’t had “The Republic” experience yet? Check them out this weekend! You can follow them on Facebook here . \nEver been to The Republic?
