(LOS ANGELES) -- Kourtney Kardashian's ex-partner, Scott Disick, has checked into a rehabilitation center in Malibu, California, for drug and alcohol addiction, a source tells Us Weekly . \nIt's the third time this year Disick, 32, has landed in rehab. He briefly checked into a Costa Rica facility for hallucinogenic treatment in March, followed by another stint at a Florida facility this past July, according to the magazine. \nWhile Scott's in rehab, Kourtney, from whom he split over the summer, has reportedly been looking after their three children: Mason, five, Penelope, three, and eight-month-old Reign. \nThe report came one day after Lamar Odom, Khloé Kardashian's ex, was found unconscious at the Love Ranch brothel in Crystal, Nevada, on Tuesday. \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
