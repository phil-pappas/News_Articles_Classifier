Little kids witnessing their parents, one by one, getting eaten by a monster car, hearing a crunching sound ... Then the state trooper who comes to their rescue gets a little too close to the battered old station wagon, despite their cries of warning ....\nKing’s collection is one of several scary new books published just in time for Halloween. Here are a few more.\nDavid Mitchell , the versatile British author of books as varied as “Black Swan Green,” “Cloud Atlas” and “The Thousand Autums of Jacob De Zoet,” turns to horror with the seriously creepy “Slade House” ( Random House , $26) .\nIn an alley behind a British working-class pub, a black metal door appears in the high brick wall every nine years. Over decades, various people are enticed to enter — a musician and her nerdy young son, a recently divorced policeman, an overweight, self-conscious college student — discovering a pastoral English garden and large manor house that can’t be seen from the street. They are greeted by people in various guises who can supply something they need, but by the time they find out what is really going on — think soul-sucking vampires — it’s too late to leave. Talk about a fate worse than death.\nMitchell is one of the best writers going these days, and “Slade House” will haunt you for days — and nights — after reading it, mainly because his characters are so normal and human and sympathetic — except for the diabolical twins who have mastered The Shaded Way.\nIn the Acknowledgments for “The Grownup” (Crown, $9.99) , Gillian Flynn thanks George R.R. Martin , “who asked me to write him a story.” So the “Gone Girl” author did. Included in Martin’s “Rogues” anthology titled “What Do You Do?” it won a 2015 Edgar Award for best short story and is now published as a stand-alone, 62-page book.\nAs in the megaselling “Gone Girl,” Flynn keeps the reader off-balance in “The Grownup,” not knowing who or what to believe.\nThe unnamed narrator is precocious young woman, a former child grifter and “soft-core” sex worker who has weaseled her way into becoming a psychic that claims to have the ability to “cleanse” haunted houses. It turns out she’s an odd mixture of smarts and gullibility.\nShe meets a desperate suburban mom whose home is the only Victorian left on a street of contemporary houses. Blood seeps out of a wall, a sense of evil pervades the gloomy rooms, and her 15-year-old stepson is acting out in bizarre ways (vomiting in a purse) and terrorizing the family. Yet her her business-traveling husband turns a blind eye and won’t hear any of his wife’s pleas for help. That husband, it turns out, is a key character in the plot of this melodramatic tale.\nIn classic fashion, it turns out that the original family of Carterhook Manor was brutally murdered — by the teenaged son, with knife and axe — in the house 100 years earlier.\nStepmother and stepson tell two very different stories, accusing each other of ever-alarming deeds, and our heroine, if we can call her that, gets caught in a sticky psychological web that could lead to murder or, at the very least, prison.\nAudrey Niffenegger , author of “The Time Traveler’s Wife” and “Her Fearful Symmetry,” has edited and illustrated a chilling new collection of her favorite haunted stories of all time.\n“Ghostly: A Collection of Ghost Stories” (Scribner, $28) features 16 stories ranging across nearly 200 years, including classics such as Edgar Allan Poe ’s “gleefully perverse” “The Black Cat,” Kelly Link’s twisted “The Specialist’s Hat” and young Chicago writer Amy Giacalone ’s weird and wonderful “Tiny Ghosts.”\nWhat do such stories have in common? Niffenegger explains that it is “their off-kilter matter-of-factness and their vivid evocations of order disrupted, sudden awful knowledge, the human condition as a cosmic joke.”\nOther writers in this eclectic collection include Edith Wharton , P.G. Wodehouse , Neil Gaiman , Rudyard Kipling , A.S. Byatt , Saki and Ray Bradbury .\n“The ghost story,” Niffenegger writes, “transcends time and culture; tales of ghosts and haunted places reverberate through the literatures of ancient Greece and Rome, the Old Testament, the ‘One Thousand and One Nights.’ Ghosts pervade Shakespeare’s plays and John Donne ’s poetry. The wrongness of the ghost is the same across cultures: something is seriously out of place.”\nsbennett@express-news.net", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/50/12/8815293/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/50/12/8815292/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/50/12/8815293/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/50/12/8815292/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/50/12/8815291/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/50/12/8815291/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/50/12/8815294/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/50/12/8815294/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-24T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T10:27:12.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
