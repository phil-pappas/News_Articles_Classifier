Suggested donation will be $10, although all donations small and kindly large will be dearly accepted. All proceeds will go towards the purchase of a reliable car for Belfast Poet Laureate Toussaint St. Negritude, whose valiant jalopy has given up the proverbial ghost. A selection of his handmade hats and items will be for sale, and the best-costumed partier will receive the coolest hat of all. \nSt. Negritude invites one and all to shake a leg, and shake the blues away, saying “I love the blues, but it's time to party on to some better driving days!” For more information, email stnegritude@gmail.com. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
