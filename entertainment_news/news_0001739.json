Anthony Bourdain is coming to town 1 / 3 Back to Gallery \nApparently the mere mention of his name causes his fans to stampede. \nAnthony Bourdain , every foodie’s favorite storyteller , will be in town next week but I can’t tell you when and where. If I do, something really, really bad will happen to me. \nI can tell you he will be in town hawking -- um, I mean celebrating -- the Balvenie Rare Craft Collection . \nHere’s the official reason for this visit, per a Balvenie rep: \n“Mr. Bourdain is in Houston to bring attention to some of America’s finest craftspeople and celebrate his partnership with The Balvenie, the world’s most handcrafted single malt Scotch whisky. The reception includes the opportunity to meet Mr. Bourdain and a tasting and private tour of the Collection led by The Balvenie Brand Ambassador Jonathan Wingo.“ \nIf you’d like to meet Bourdain, go to us.thebalvenie.com/warehouse24 and register. People who sign up may have the opportunity to attend next week’s or a similar event. \nIf you are one of the lucky, you’ll be sent an invitation with event details. And that would be good, because you’re not getting them from me.
