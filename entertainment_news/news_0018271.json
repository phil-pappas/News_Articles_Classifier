(Photo: Francesco Carrozzini/Cosmopolitan) 7 CONNECT 47 TWEET LINKEDIN 8 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nMove over, Obamas in the White House; there's another \"First Family\" taking up space in America's cultural landscape and their names start with K. \nThe Kardashians sprawl across Cosmopolitan magazine's November cover under the headline \"America's First Family,\" causing outrage on Twitter and among editors of black-oriented media and websites. \nBut the magazine, celebrating its 50th anniversary, says calm down: The cover is just a \"teasing\" way to describe the Kardashians as the \"huge cultural phenomenon\" that they are. \nAnd anyway, if Kim Kardashian's husband, Kanye West, succeeds in his quest to add POTUS to his resume, who knows? A photo posted by Cosmopolitan (@cosmopolitan) on Oct 4, 2015 at 6:16pm PDT \nThe cover, featuring Kim, Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian with Kris, Kylie and Kendall Jenner, all wearing white shirts, promises \"16 Pages! Like You've Never Seen Them Before\" inside. \nThe Kardashians were tweeting and Instagraming their delight about the cover. Happy 50th Birthday @cosmopolitan So excited to be on the November cover with my family!!!! ðŸ“· @francescocarrozzini pic.twitter.com/8WN2K1DC3J â€” Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) October 5, 2015 \nBut to some on Twitter, the cover seemed to be deliberate belittling of the real First Family â€” the nation's first African-American First Family: President Obama, first lady Michelle Obama, and their daughters Malia and Sasha. @Cosmopolitan Shame on you for that Kardashian first family crap. You people need to get a clue. â€” Tahirah A-Williams (@takbarwi) October 5, 2015 Sorry Cosmo, there's only one First Family of America & it ain't the Kardashians. #CosmoFail pic.twitter.com/Su7p51ylqN â€” Eric Wolfson (@EricWolfson) October 5, 2015 I am not a fan of the Obamas in any way, but shame on @Cosmopolitan for calling the Kardashians the \"first family.\" #classless", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T20:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:55:41.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
