I don’t like heights. Therefore, I was apprehensive when I learned about a possible double zip line that would shoot people across the front of Rochester’s High Falls. Yes, that’s the same Genesee River spot where daredevil Sam Patch jumped to his death in 1829.\n“Imagine sailing over High Falls,” says online material from Greentopia, the ecology awareness group that’s going to install and operate the zip line. “The wind whipping your hair, the spectacular view surrounds you.”\nYikes.\nGREENTOPIA\nComing soon to an urban waterfall near you: The GardenAerial zipline\nThen again, when I mention the zip line to other people, they ask where they can sign up. It could be that Lewis Stess and Michael Philipson, the founders of Greentopia, are on to something. After all, they have lots of good ideas, ideas that often connect Rochester’s past with its present and its future.\nThose ideas will be on display this week at Greentopia’s Futures Summit, a gathering of experts on urban ecology and sustainability.\nThe summit runs all day on Wednesday at Monroe Community College’s Brighton campus, beginning with a keynote address by Jason Roberts, originator of the Better Block Project in Dallas, an effort that Greentopia’s founders would like to undertake here.\n“It all goes back to our mission,” Philipson says. “We want to create resilient public realms.”\n“It all goes back to our mission. We want to create resilient public realms.”\nMichael Philipson, Greentopia co-founder In 2008, Philipson and Stess began putting together the nonprofit organization that became Friends of the GardenAerial in 2011. The name referred to a proposal to turn the Pont de Rennes Bridge over the Genesee River just north of the High Falls into a green walk of flowers and plants.\nThat project is underway, and the organization, which is now known as Greentopia, is working on other initiatives to showcase High Falls, a hiding-in-plain-sight wonder that Stess calls “the most spectacular place we don’t visit.”\nAmong Greentopia’s other projects is a 300-foot-long FlourGarden, a space for growing native plants. It is being created in what was Brown’s Race, the small canal for generating power for flour mills near the High Falls.\nGreentopia also has started Green Visions, a project that has involved working with residents of the JOSANA neighborhood on the city’s west side creating flower gardens on abandoned lots. The flowers are then harvested and sold. Program participants split the profits.\nBeyond all of this, Greentopia is putting together the city’s first EcoDistrict, a self-sustaining area that will include JOSANA — an acronym for the Jay Orchard Street Neighborhood Association — and High Falls.\n“It’s a district where it’s small enough to innovate and large enough to have an impact,” Stess says.\nAlso down the line for Greentopia is a proposed bridge that would take pedestrians across the river near the crest of the High Falls.\nAnd where does that zip line fit in?\nPossibly the longest and highest zip line in North America, it would bring people, brave people, to the river and the falls, Stess and Philipson say. And it would provide income for other projects.\nReally, it’s a good idea. Really.\nIf you go\nWhat: The third Greentopia’s Future’s Summit, a conference featuring speakers on building sustainable communities and improving cities.\nWhere: Monroe Community College, Brighton.\nWhen: Wednesday.
