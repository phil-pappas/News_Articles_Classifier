Sir Ian, who was also presenting the award, asked: \"Can I come along?\"\nSpeaking over the phone, Maguire advised that Holmes, 55, should go topless for the challenge, although he opted to wear a navy polo shirt.\nOut on the balcony of the building on London's Embankment, the veteran 76-year-old actor was shown advising an apprehensive Holmes not to back out: \"The nation would know, darling, they all heard you promise it. No, I think you'd better be a brave boy.\"\nHe added: \"I've done it, it's quite bracing\" - giving the broadcaster the option of having him and Langsford each throw a bucket in his face, or tip them over his head.\n\"That wasn't so bad, was it?\" Sir Ian asked after dumping out the water. As a stunned-looking Holmes was unable to speak, the actor added: \"Eamonn Holmes speechless - we've all longed for that.\"\nShare article Langsford, 55, then gave her husband and co-presenter a kiss on the head and offered to have Sir Ian present the show if Holmes comes down with pneumonia.\nAsked to give his three nominations for who should complete the challenge within the next 24 hours, he nominated Sir Alex Ferguson (twice) and This Morning editor Martin Frizell.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/zLL7y61kKVE", "https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-02T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:19:03.274+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
