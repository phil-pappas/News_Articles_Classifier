It follows the driving license as it becomes credit card sized, and will be able to fit into your wallet.\nThose over the age of 18 can apply for your card at DFA.ie or via the mobile app which is launching in conjunction with the card. The card may also spell the end of having to drop into the local pharmacy to get your photo taken, as the app allows users to take a selfie as their ID photo.\nThe passport will cost â‚¬35, plus an additional credit transaction fee, and will take an estimated 20-25 working days to process the application, with the service having the capacity to process up to 3,000 applications per week.\nVia Irish Independent\nMORE: Pics: A German newspaper published an entire edition without any photos\nMORE: Selfies killed more people this year than shark attacks\nMORE: These Instagram awards will have Irish people glued to their phones", "external_links": ["http://www.independent.ie/life/travel/travel-news/have-selfie-will-travel-new-irish-passport-card-launched-31582937.html", "https://www.dfa.ie/passportcard/"], "published": "2015-10-06T00:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:38:15.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
