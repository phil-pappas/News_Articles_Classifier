He has released five albums over the past seven years and won the hearts of the New Zealand television viewing public as a judge on The X Factor NZ since 2013. He is also a budding actor, starring in the popular Mt Zion which also stars Temuera Morrison, and New Zealand film Born To Dance, which was released in cinemas this month. \nWalker will perform during the Turangi Christmas in the Park and 50th Jubilee finale at Te Kapua Park on Saturday, December 12, which is being organised by Safe Turangi’s Christmas in the Park Committee. It is being supported by TaupÅ District Council, TÅ«wharetoa MÄori Trust Board, BayTrust, Genesis Energy, Creative Communities Scheme, The Lines Company and King Country Energy. \nMayor David Trewavas said the confirmation of Walker for the concert was a huge coup for Turangi. \"Almost everyone has heard of Stan Walker - he is a hugely popular and incredibly talented artist, so to have him here in Turangi is fantastic for the town and the district,\" he said. \"We are thrilled he is coming, and congratulate the committee for being able to attract an artist of Stan’s calibre.\" \nMr Trewavas said Walker’s presence at the concert was likely to bring in hundreds of visitors to Turangi from around the North Island. \"It will be great to see Turangi’s cafes, accommodation and streets buzzing with all the activity generated by this event,\" he said. \nTurangi Tongariro Community Board chairman and Christmas in the Park committee spokesman Tangonui (Tong) Kingi said while Walker was the headlining act, he would be supported by a number of other local and national artists that were yet to be confirmed. There would also be games, prizes, bouncy castles and other entertainment for the kids, and the day would finish with a spectacular fireworks display. \nThe event would also include celebrations that were specific to Turangi, to emphasise the importance of the Turangi 50thJubilee, Mr Kingi said. \"We want to incorporate all the elements that make Turangi special, so we have a few things up our sleeve to celebrate this community.\". More than 3000 people are expected to attend. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T06:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T11:59:46.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
