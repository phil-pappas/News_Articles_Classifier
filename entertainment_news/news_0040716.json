Tonight he’s in Italy, where he gets a home-cooked meal at chef Nancy Silverton’s house in Umbria. If you missed last week’s debut set in Tokyo, track it down ( here’s what I wrote about it last week ). I love this show. \nGotham (8 p.m., Fox) – Gordon faces off with Jerome, and a magic show at a gala for Gotham Children’s Hospital becomes a hostage situation. \nLife in Pieces (8:30 p.m., CBS) – Matt teaches Colleen how to connect with his family, and Greg has an encounter with cops when he’s overtired. \nSignificant Mother (9:30 p.m., CW) – The first season ends with Nate asking Sam and Atticus to help convince Jimmy that he made a mistake. \nCastle (10 p.m., ABC) – Castle poses as a college professor so he can investigate a student’s gruesome murder.
