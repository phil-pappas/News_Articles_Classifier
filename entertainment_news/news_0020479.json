Photo: Peter Greig \nNormally, Rafael Bonachela​ isn't keen on anything that draws attention away from his dancers. But the Sydney Dance Company's artistic director will happily make an exception when it comes to collaborations with the Australian Chamber Orchestra.\nIf audience members tell him they found themselves watching the musicians for a while, that's absolutely fine. Why not, he says, when the partnership involves the two ensembles in the same space, sharing the stage.\nMelbourne audiences have a chance to see this team in action in Illuminated , a one-off performance by the SDC and the ACO at the Arts Centre's State Theatre  today at 5pm.\nSydney Dance Company artistic director Rafael Bonachela says Illuminated is about \"the artistry of both forms coming together.\" Photo: Peter Greig \nAdvertisement The three works in the program, all choreographed by Bonachela, have not been seen in Melbourne before. Illuminated is made up of two strands, one drawing on the music of British 20th-century composer Benjamin Britten, the other on French baroque composer Jean-Philippe Rameau.\nLive music has a special charge, Bonachela says, and placing more than a score of musicians on stage creates an intense, heightened connection, not only for the audience but also for the dancers.\n \"It's thrilling, in every possible way. Powerful, and beautiful to watch. It's about the artistry of both forms coming together.\" ACO's musicians, he says, are eminently watchable. \"They're very active, they're dancing themselves.\"\nBonachela feels that the chamber orchestra and the contemporary dance company have much in common. \"There is a spirit of similarity in the way we work and present ourselves,\" he says.\nThey have already explored the partnership in very different settings. The Britten works have been performed on a catwalk, in a concert hall, and now \"on a beautiful, generous stage. Who knows,\" Bonachela adds, \"one day an outdoor space might give us an opportunity\".\nThe program begins with Variation 10 , a work performed to Britten's Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge . Soprano Taryn Fiebig​ then joins the ACO for Les Illuminations , created to Britten's song cycle based on the poems of Arthur Rimbaud. It concludes with excerpts from Project Rameau , the first collaboration between Bonachela and ACO artistic director Richard Tognetti.\nThe name of Rameau came up very early in the conversation between Tognetti and Bonachela, when they talked about joining forces. \"I wanted to bring a contemporary dance vocabulary to a baroque work created for dance,\" Bonachela says.\nAfter Melbourne, the SDC takes Illuminated to Hong Kong with the ACO, and then to Germany, where the company will perform with a local orchestra.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T16:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:33:56.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
