However, upcoming biopic The Journey, looks to be more closer to a drama in tone and setting.\nFollowing the careers of Martin McGuinness and Ian Paisley, from mortal enemies to the media-dubbed 'Chuckle Brothers', The Journey nears the screen against the backdrop of rising tension up North.\nDirected by Killing Bono's Nick Hamm and a script by Colin Bateman, The Journey is currently mid-production with an expected release date some time in 2016.\nIn the meantime, the first image has been released showing Colm Meaney and Timothy Spall's transformation into Martin McGuinness and Ian Paisley.\nIt's pretty spot-on, in fairness. Spall's always capable of rearranging himself to suit a role and Meaney, as we know, is always dependable in a role such as this.\nIt'll be interesting to see how The Journey plays with audiences both here and in the North.
