Where we're going we don't need roads, because the future is here.\n\" Back to the Future Part II \" came out 25 years ago in 1989, sending Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) to the future: October 21, 2015. If you're thinking fourth dimensionally, that means today is \"Back to the Future\" Day!\nBut does today really look like the '80s-esque vision of what could be, such as flying cars, fax machines (ha!) and the Chicago Cubs winning the World Series?\n22 futuristic predictions \" Back to the Future \" got right -- and wrong:\n1. Hoverboards (WRONG)\nSeeing Marty use a floating skateboard to evade bullies (and later save Doc's lady Clara in \"Back to the Future Part III\") made everyone immediately want to buy their own. The only problem is they didn't exist and they still don't, though we have hovercrafts and non-floating replicas of the Mattel Hoverboard. Tony Hawk and others had fun with a \" Huvr hoax ,\" but the closest thing we have today could be the HENDO Hoverboard, a magnetic skateboard that can only float above a copper surface -- and only one inch off the ground -- and the \" Hero Board ,\" currently available at a Destiny USA mall kiosk.\n2. Sneakers with power laces (RIGHT?)\nNike designer Tinker Hatfield promised sneakers with self-tying \"power laces\" will be released in 2015, just in time to make the movie's predictions true. In 2011, the shoe company sold 1,500 Nike Air MAG replicas that lit up like Marty's actual kicks (but didn't lace up automatically) to benefit the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research. A tweet from Nike Tuesday teased what's next.\n. @realmikefox see you tomorrow.\n— Nike (@Nike) October 21, 2015 3. Auto-drying jackets and inside-out pants (WRONG)\nFuturistic fashion is almost always wrong in movies, but at least \"BTTF\" didn't make everyone wear shiny jumpsuits. And thank goodness, inside-out pants haven't taken off -- or backwards clothes, like Kris Kross.\n4. Flying cars (WRONG)\nDriver-less and self-driving cars are starting to make \"Demolition Man\" seem oddly realistic, but flying cars? Anyone who's ever been in a car crash can imagine the dangers of letting just anyone fly their vehicles around at 88 mph -- though it would be cool to see more DeLoreans.\n5. 3-D movies and doing sequels to death (RIGHT)\n\"Jaws 19\" hasn't happened yet (though Universal did make a fake trailer for one), but we've got seven \"Saw\" movies, at least five more \"Star Wars\" movies are in the works, and seemingly everything's in 3-D these days. The Scenery Channel still hasn't happened yet, though.\n6. Flat-screen TVs mounted on the wall (RIGHT)\nNot everyone's got a wall-sized television unit like the McFly family, but flat-screen high-definition TVs with the 16x9 aspect are now common.\n7. Fax machines and phone booths (WRONGish)\nOK, phone booths and fax machines still exist, but when's the last time you saw someone using them? Marty Jr. is seen using a pay phone and old Marty gets fired via fax, showing that writer-director Robert Zemeckis had no idea cell phones (or smartphones) were on the horizon.\n8. Tablets, Google Glass, digital cameras, more devices (RIGHT)\nIn the future, you can sign a petition to save the clock tower by pressing your finger on what looks like an iPad or Kindle. Marty and Jennifer's (Elisabeth Shue) kids use \"TV glasses\" to answer the phone, which sounds a lot like Google Glass and other wearable smart devices that exist (though Google ceased production earlier this year). Doc takes photos with a digital camera that actually looks outdated now. And the family \"talks\" to the house, turning on lights and televisions -- which are also possible through computer voice assistants like Siri and Cortana.\n9. Rehydrated pizza (WRONG)\nGrandma (Lea Thompson) \"rehydrates\" a pizza in seconds, turning a little frozen block into a large, hot meal. Dehydrated food does exist (astronauts eat it) but rehydrated? That doesn't sound organic -- or likely to happen anytime soon.\n10. Pepsi Perfect (RIGHT)\nIn Cafe 80's, Marty Jr. orders a \" Pepsi Perfect \" which now technically exists. Pepsi released 6,500 collectible soda bottles that say \"Pepsi Perfect\" on them and they cost $20.15 (get it?) but they exist, and if you're a \"BTTF\" fan, you want one -- but it's already sold out .\n11. Penalties for illegal performance enhancements in sports (RIGHT)\nGawker points out the USA Today that has the front page headline about Marty (and later Biff's gang) being jailed also has a side-column headline about a pitcher being suspended for using a bionic arm. It's not the same as PEDs like steroids, but can you imagine Stephen Strasburg with a bionic arm?\n12. A baseball team in Miami (RIGHT)\nSpeaking of baseball, a hologram in 2015 tells Marty that Miami was in the World Series. The Miami-based Florida Marlins made their MLB debut in 1993, four years after the movie.\n13. Cubs win the World Series (WRONG)\nThat same hologram says Chicago beat Miami, which hasn't happened yet. In fact, the Cubbies still haven't won a World Series since 1908 -- though they're currently in the NLCS, one game away from being eliminated by the New York Mets for the World Series.\n14. Queen Diana (WRONG)\nThe futuristic USA Today, sent by compu-fax satellite , also refers to Princess Diana as a queen, which she could've been at this point, if she hadn't been killed in a car crash in 1997. Diana would've turned 54 this year.\n15. Drones (RIGHT)\nBusiness Insider adds the photo of young Biff being arrested in 2015 was taken by a USA Today drone. That's a growing reality, though the newspaper might not have its own drone yet.\n16. Mr. Fusion (WRONG)\nAs iO9 writes, Mr. Fusion would have been the movie's most useful invention -- if it were real. It's basically a personal energy reactor that literally transforms garbage into clean fuel for a car (and takes care of throwing out the trash).\n17. Suspended animation kennels (WRONG)\niO9 also brings up a scene where Doc says he left his dog Einstein in a suspended animation kennel. The testing that would go into developing such a device sounds frightening.\n18. Video games that don't require hands (RIGHT)\nRemember seeing little Elijah Wood at the arcade game, telling Michael J. Fox that having to use your hands to play video games is \"like a baby's toy?\" Hello, Nintendo Wii and Microsoft Kinect.\n19. Thumbprints to make payments (RIGHT)\nOld Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) uses his thumbprint to pay for a cab ride and the iPhone 6S uses fingerprints on its Touch ID for Apple Pay , making payments simply by waving a smartphone at checkout at Wegmans and other retailers.\n20. Double ties (WRONG)\nYes, 2015 Marty wears two ties. Has anyone tried that in real life? Who could pull it off?\n21. Laser discs (WRONG)\n11 Points notes that Marty and Doc hide passed out Jennifer's body on a pile of laser discs, which have been almost completely obliterated by cloud storage, streaming video and Blu-Ray DVDs.\n22. Video conferencing (RIGHT)\nOld Marty talks with Needles (Red Hot Chili Peppers' Flea) and his boss via a video call. FaceTime, Skype, G+ Hangouts and dozens of other video conferencing services now exist, proving the future is finally here. Sort of.\nCollege Humor made a video showing what the real 2015 looks like, and how Marty would experience it (some explicit language):\nFox and Lloyd discussed the many predictions the movie got right in a new Toyota ad:\nAlso, enjoy this special message from Doc himself:\n10/21/15! The Future is NOW! Doc Brown has a special message just for you. #BTTF2015\nPosted by Back to the Future Trilogy on Tuesday, October 20, 2015 By the way, no one's predicting a \" Back to the Future 4 ,\" though Lloyd says he's open to one. Bob Gale, who co-wrote and co-produced the original \"Back to the Future\" trilogy, has repeatedly said no to a sequel.\n\"Let's face it, we've seen a lot of sequels that are made years and years later and I don't think I can name one that's any good, that lives up to the originals,\" Gale told Yahoo Movies last week.\nOf course, reboots and spinoffs are another story -- a \"Back to the Future\" musical is still in the works.\nHappy #BackToTheFuture Day!
