(G.G. Rigsby/Effingham Now). By G.G. Rigsby Ruby is a white rabbit that is available for adoption from the Effingham animal shelter.\nShe is about a year-and-a-half old and is trained to use a litter box. Her owners surrendered her to the shelter, saying they are moving.\nShe has not been spayed.\n“She’s a nice rabbit,” said Shelter Director Lorna Shelton. “She’s good-natured and doesn’t seem aggressive.”\nShe can be adopted for a fee of $25.\nAlso up for adoption this week is Maizy, a 1-year-old Catahoula Leopard Dog.\nShe would do well with a big yard and active family, Shelton said.\n“She’s a little shy at first, but she warms up to people quickly,” Shelton said. “She’d be a great family dog.”\nShelton said the shelter got a truckload of dog food this week from Harvey’s in Springfield and TailsSpin in Pooler. She said the food was very much appreciated.\nThe fee to adopt animals from the Effingham shelter is $50 for dogs and $40 for cats, which includes shots.\nPeople who adopt animals from the shelter must agree to have them spayed or neutered within 30 days, or be subject to a $200 fine. The shelter is following up to make sure that people abide by the law.\nAnimals must receive a rabies and a “DAPP” shot — for distemper, adenovirus, parainfluenza and parvovirus.\nSomeone who adopts can take the animal home but must agree to bring the animal back on a Monday or Thursday to get its shots.\nThe shelter’s phone number is 912-754-2109. It is open for adoptions Mondays and Thursdays from 1 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. and Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.\nThe office hours, when the shelter accepts drop-offs, are 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.\nThe address for the shelter’s adoption page is: http://www.effinghamcounty.org/DepartmentsAF/AnimalShelter/AdoptionPage.aspx", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/ECU1021ANIMALS1_0.jpg", "http://www.effinghamcounty.org/DepartmentsAF/AnimalShelter/AdoptionPage.aspx", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/ECU1021ANIMALS2.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/ECU1021ANIMALS2.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/ECU1021ANIMALS1_0.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T12:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:11:55.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
