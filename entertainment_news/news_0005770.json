Others who have been honoured with the prize include Underworld, Mark Ronson, Sonic Youth, Massive Attack, Sigur Ros, The Prodigy and Muse. Jean Michel Jarre winning the award in 2014 (Joel Ryan/AP) \nGary said: “To receive any award in music is an honour. But to receive the Q Innovation In Sound award is particularly special. \n“Sound is the most important aspect of making music to me, it’s why electronic music has been such an obsession. It allows you the opportunity to constantly create new and exciting sounds. I’m very grateful to Q for the award, and very proud.” \nNuman has been a true music pioneer since he first rose to prominence with his band, Tubeway Army. Gary Numan (Mark Allan/AP) \nHis songs have been covered by Foo Fighters and Sugababes, and sampled by producers such as J Dilla and GZA, and his influence has resonated across pop, rock, industrial, electronica and hip-hop over the last three-and-a-half decades – all while he continues to make his own records. \nThree of his classic albums – Replicas, The Pleasure Principle and Telekon – are about to be reissued on vinyl and performed live in UK shows this month. \nHaving taken place annually since 1990, the Q Awards – run by the monthly music magazine – will be hosted by Absolute Radio’s Christian O’Connell in 2015. \nVoting is open online for seven of the categories, with nominees including Florence + The Machine, Foals, Ed Sheeran, Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds, Blur, Everything Everything, Jamie XX, Muse, James Bay, Sam Smith, Kanye West, Taylor Swift, The Libertines, New Order and The Weeknd. \nLast year’s winners included Sam Smith, Ed Sheeran, Jamie XX, Kasabian, Pink Floyd and Culture Club.
