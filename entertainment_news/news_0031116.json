Passport return raises hopes for Melbourne visit Ai Weiwei to make fourth visit to Australia for National Gallery of Victoria exhibition Ai Weiwei brings Forever Bicycles sculpture to NGV Chinese artist and activist Ai Weiwei​'s installation featuring portraits of Australian activists looks set to proceed despite toy company Lego refusing to fill a major order of its plastic bricks for the work on \"political grounds\".\nThe artist, whose exhibition Andy Warhol Ai Weiwei  opens at the National Gallery of Victoria on December 11, made the claim in an Instagram post late on Friday.\nChinese artist Ai Weiwei at Sydney's Sherman Gallery during a previous visit to Australia in 2008.

Photo: Ai Weiwei \nIn September Lego refused Ai Weiwei Studio request for a bulk order of Legos to create artwork to be shown at the National Gallery of Victoria as they cannot approve the use of Legos for political works. On Oct 21, a British firm formally announced that it will open a new Legoland in Shanghai as one of the many deals of the U.K.-China Golden Era. \nA photo posted by Ai Weiwei (@aiww) on Oct 23, 2015 at 6:04am PDT \nIt is believed he had requested the toy bricks for one of several major works commissioned especially for the NGV show, a room-scale installation featuring portraits of Australian activists who have championed human rights and freedom of speech.\nAi's Instagram post appears to have been prompted by Chinese president Xi Linping's visit to the UK this week, during which it was announced that a British firm had secured the contract to build a new Legoland in China.\nThe Danish toy company is in the process of building a new factory in China, due to open in 2017, as part of its expansion into Asia.  \nAi has used Lego in previous works, including a similar installation for an exhibition at the former Alcatraz prison in San Francisco, featuring portraits made from the plastic bricks of people including Edward Snowden and Nelson Mandela.\nYesterday afternoon the artist posted a statement, accompanying a photo of LEGO bricks in a toilet bowl, on his Instagram account from the Lego Group, stating that supplying Lego bricks to the artist is against their corporate policy to \"indicate our approval of any unaffiliated activities outside the LEGO licensing program. However, we realize that artists may have an interest in using LEGO elements, or casts hereof, as an integrated part of their piece of art\".\nThe statement continued: \"In this connection, the LEGO Group would like to draw your attention to the following:\n\nThe LEGO trademark cannot be used commercially in any way to promote, or name, the art work.\nThe title of the artwork cannot incorporate the LEGO trademark.\nWe cannot accept that the motive(s) are taken directly from our sales material/copyrighted photo material.\nThe motive(s) cannot contain any political, religious, racist, obscene or defaming statements.\nIt must be clear to the public that the LEGO Group has not sponsored or endorsed the art work/project.\n\nTherefore I am very sorry to let you know that we are not in a position to support the exhibition Andy Warhol | Ai Weiwei by supplying the bulk order.\" Ai Weiwei Studio was informed by NGV about Lego's rejection of the bulk order.\n\nAs a commercial entity, Lego produces and sells toys, movies and amusement parks attracting children across the globe. As a powerful corporation, Lego is an influential cultural and political actor in the globalized economy with questionable values. \nLego's refusal to sell its product to the artist is an act of censorship and discrimination.\"\nAi added his own comments underneath the official statement, accusing the corporation of censorship.\n\"As a commercial entity, Lego produces and sells toys, movies and amusement parks attracting children across the globe.

It'll definitely happen,\" Delany said of the commission \"but I'd prefer not to talk about it.\"\nWei's post prompted an outcry on social media, with some suggesting people collect Lego pieces to send to him to help complete the installation.\n \nLove how many Twitter peeps are suggesting to donate #LEGO pieces to @aiww for his art when the company refused his request for a bulk order\n— Ai Weiwei Film (@AWWNeverSorry) October 24, 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T10:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T14:21:49.747+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
