She says she is not signing another fiction entertainer anytime soon as she needs a much-deserved break. Rumour mills have been abuzz that Kritika has been approached for a new TV show on &tv, but she wonders where her name has cropped up from. “I’m not doing any show (as of now). I have just finished the last day of shooting for ‘Reporters’ on October 6, and right now I have no plan to take up anything so soon . I need a break,” Kritika told IANS over phone from Mumbai. Not one to do back-to-back fiction shows, the actress, who has earlier impressed small screen lovers in “Kitani Mohabbat Hai” and “Kuch Toh Log Kahenge” and as the host of “MTV Webbed”, says she has always been open to different things in the realm of entertainment. “I’ve done fiction shows, non-fiction shows, short films and I’ve also been an anchor on TV, so I like to maintain a balance. As of now, I’m in talks for somethings, but it will only be feasible to talk about it when there’s something concrete,” Kritika said, and even hinted that a film may be in the works too. The actress has also been seen doing some interesting short films, which have been received well on digital platforms such as YouTube and Facebook. Her short film “Dry Dreams” was also screened at the Jagran Film Festival. For now, it’s a holiday that’s on her mind! Kritika says her experience on “Reporters”— a newsroom drama show — in which she starred with Rajeev Khandelwal, has been wonderful for her “professionally and personally”. “It has been a very special show, with great people…It was a dream team. The concept was something new, and what was particularly wonderful was that the story was not changed or moulded for the sake of TRPs,” she said. What Kritika especially loved about “Reporters” was its finite concept. The show began on Sony Entertainment Television only in April, and will end soon . “One of the reasons why I loved doing ‘Reporters’ is that it was a finite show and It was a clear script from start to finish. Indian television needs more of such formats,” she said. The curtains came down on the show’s shooting with a wrap-up party, where the entire team congregated and raised a toast.
