Sienkiewicz that is a story about how oppressive it is for women, or anyone, really, to be silenced by shame.\nWe've seen people like Angelica in the news. Each time a woman comes forward to share her story of being drugged and raped by a beloved television personality, we see someone who was silenced by shame for decades. Angelica is real in that sense that, not so long ago, any children born of rape would have lived with an unimaginable stigma. \"No one can do that to you unless you let them\" would have been the message all women absorbed.\nBut, at the same time, there's hope for all of the Angelicas. Perhaps it's never too late to find your path in life--to leave your past and the secrets that haunt you behind. Maybe a first love, once lost, then found again, can become true and lasting.\n\"The heart is imprisoned not by being broken, but by being silenced\" (Martha Beck). By telling our stories, we embrace who we are. We do not have to be defined by the tragedies that have happened to us. Life is good for the simple reason that it's our life. This is the message in \"In the Context of Love.\"\nIn the Context of Love\nBy Linda K.
