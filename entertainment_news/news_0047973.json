So the movie asks, ‘Is her life predestined?’\n“She says, ‘No, he named me Malala. But he didn’t make me Malala. This is my life and I’m going to live it.’ ”\nThere’s a startling moment when Guggenheim questions Malala about her suffering and she will not answer.\n“She does not dwell on those things,” the filmmaker said. “I think, partly it is she knows there are millions of other girls who are suffering right now.”\nContinued the Los Angeles resident, “I come from a part of the country where if you don’t get your cold-pressed coffee served correctly, people complain all day.\n“Malala knows what it’s like to be a refugee, to have her school closed, her father threatened, her friends killed. People who have been like that — you see that with American soldiers who have been in conflict — they don’t like to talk about their suffering. There’s a stoicism and a modesty about it.\n“But I also think she’s a deeply felt individual. It’s not as if she’s in denial about it; I just think she’s not willing to dwell on suffering.”\nGuggenheim says the father and daughter changed his life.\n“After being with them, I came home and asked myself, ‘Am I as righteous as this man?’ He inspired me to be a better father.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:50:19.107+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
