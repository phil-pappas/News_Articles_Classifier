She treats her Vanda orchid with its long tangles of aerial roots like a pet. And although she makes a living selling everything from figs and ferns to philodendrons (as well as linen napkins, porcelain teacups and 25-litre bags of potting mix), she insists plants are \"not a consumer item\". \"They take time, they are a living thing, not just an object.\"\nHer shop is Mr Kitly, an upstairs nursery-cum-handmade-homewares business with a mere slip of a door-front on Sydney Road, Brunswick. When she set it up in 2010 we were yet to go full-blown crazy for all things artisan. But five years on and she gets both Apartamento  reading hipsters and mature-age plant fanatics up her stairs. \nIf you had to specify Claffey's aesthetic, you would say it's under-designed. She is not keen on apparent preening and cleaning but likes a take-it-or-leave-it-because-it-just-turned-out-this-way look. You get the gist in her book, Indoor Green: Living with Plants , which was launched at the shop recently. In it she has pictures of succulents taking out a drycleaner's window in New York; verdant rubber plants in faded plastic pots in Kyoto; and a flower-and-variegation-filled \"Hungarian winter garden\" that has been flourishing for decades in a tiled sunroom in Melbourne's Windsor.\nFrom Indoor Green , published by Thames & Hudson. \nClaffey speaks to local and overseas artists, botanists, scientists, collectors and landscape architects about plants as muses, air-cleaners, a form of interior decoration, obsessions, relaxants, points of connection with nature and as a way of engendering \"community\". She describes herself as \"an interested lay person\" and says in writing the book she was \"super-conscious\" she was no expert. \"Plants have been a gradual thing for me. I wasn't wandering around at age 15 going, I love indoor plants.\" \nAdvertisement But at 15 she did have her first stint in Japan, which proved pivotal. Claffey, who grew up on a farm outside Sale, proceeded to spend five years in Kyoto in her 20s. \"It was a really influential age; I was like a sponge aesthetically sucking things up. People think Japan is very Zen and minimalist but the houses are small and crammed full of things.\"\nWe are sitting in her back-of-shop home kitchen sipping water from Japanese timber tumblers while her architect partner is testing an English copper watering can in the sink. He has made timber shelving for her vast collection of indoor plants (including a Calathea​ a friend passed on to her more than a decade ago and a Monstera deliciosa​  that was here when she moved in) and has suspended an old metal gate from the ceiling from which saucepans hang. There is a tottering pile of egg-cartons on the fridge and a collection of handmade ceramic teacups on a shelf. Knocked-about plastic storage tubs sit alongside a knife block that has been as meticulously sculpted as a royal crown. \nSplashes of colour in Indoor Green . \nIt's all in keeping with her shop, where she makes plant cutting powder and African violet food look as much like designer objects as a handmade-in-Japan triangular twist vase. Similarly in her book she places an essay by a retired NASA scientist (on how \"to grow fresh air\") between a profile of a 1960s plant-filled house in Geelong and a \"personal jungle\" in Kyoto.\nIn New York's Brooklyn she interviews plant-collecting ceramicist Shino Takeda (\"Plants got the first pick of the space and whatever was left was filled with paintings and sculptures.\") In Melbourne she speaks to the likes of Joe Crawford, a retired police officer who is mad about orchids and for decades has been tending hundreds of them in greenhouses in his Maribyrnong garden, and Mary Featherstone in her widely lauded Ivanhoe house with a garden inside that Robin Boyd designed for her and her husband, Grant, in 1967.\nArtist Stanislava Pinchuk (or Miso) speaks about the pleasure of tattooing friends in exchange for plants and landscape architect John Patrick writes about a wicking-bed planter designed by Richard Carlson for Melbourne homewares company Décor in the 1980s. \nClaffey, who has collaborated with Décor on a new range of sizes and colours for this self-watering plastic pot, says she is interested in how houseplants can \"enliven discussions\" about creativity, aesthetics, community, culture and the environment. \"As I've discovered, houseplants can open up new worlds.\"\nIndoor Green: Living With Plants , published by Thames & Hudson, $49.99.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:22:29.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
