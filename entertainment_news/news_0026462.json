The Canadian singer whose real name is Abel Makkonen Tesfaye tells Rolling Stone for his cover story that the country/pop singer was drawn to his hair when they first met at a Grammy after-party. \"Everyone was hammered,\" he says. \"But the whole time she was talking,\" he says, \"she was kind of, like, petting my hair? I think she was just drawn to it - she must have been a little gone off a few drinks. And of course I'm not going to be like, 'Hey, can you stop?' I mean, it felt good! But when she started petting my hair, that's when I was like, 'I definitely need a drink.' \" A photo posted by Rolling Stone (@rollingstone) on Oct 21, 2015 at 9:59am PDT Taylor loves his music too. \"She actually schooled me on my own sh*t,\" he reveals. \"She was like, 'I've been listening to 'The Morning' [from House of Balloons ] for years - it's one of my favorite songs ever!' I mean, she might have just Googled it. But she seemed genuine.\" The Weeknd says his hair was inspired by Jean-Michel Basquiat. \"I want to be remembered as iconic and different,\" he explains. \"So I was like, 'F*ck it - I'm gonna let my hair just be what it wants.' I'll probably cut it if it starts interfering with my sight. I can kind of see it right now. But if I cut it, I'd look like everyone else. And that's just so boring to me.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T15:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:54:38.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
