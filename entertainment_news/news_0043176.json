At the time of signing much fanfare was made of its membership and accord with the mandate of the Court, yet now it backtracks and conveniently bends rules in order to save itself embarrassment.\nBut embarrassment it would not be, it would actually be hailed for giving effect to the warrant, but then in South Africa and especially under the ANC they never let anyone tell them what to do, even if they are obligatory to do it, as they signed the accord.\nArguments by the ANC that the ICC is only pursuing and prosecuting African leaders is of no relevance, as it signed the accord and the mandate and modus operandi of the court is of no significance as it at the time of signing didn't have any reservations on being obligatory to enforce rulings handed down in terms of matters of the ICC.\nIronically since this incident the President of South Africa paid two official visits at the invitation of the one that was supposed to be arrested, and signed, according and that is if we can believe the media, some accords that would be beneficial to both countries.\nThe question that one needs to ask is why do we want to do ‘business’ with a country where human right abuses are so obvious that an International Criminal Court wants the President of the country to be arrested and stand trial.\nBy signing these accords with such a country we are basically saying – ‘don’t worry we know you are doing this to your citizens, but it is okay, we still want to do business with you,’ as by implication condoning such abuses.\nAnd now at the recent ANC congress in Midrand one of the matters tabled is that the ANC is seriously considering its signing of the Rome accord and even cancelling its membership!\nThis in essence means that it in no way wants to be part of the Court that acts for the betterment and humanity of all.\nSo South Africa will just sit and watch how crimes against humanity are increasing, will not act against such countries in an international forum, and in doing so, saying: “You can violate human rights, but when you come to South Africa, you are safe we will not arrest you!’ even if the ICC says so.\nThe ANC in South Africa vehemently prohibits any human rights abuses in our country, but when it comes to other countries doing the same we are laissez faire and blasé and don’t want anyone to act against them.\nDouble standards is the only thing we can say – and all this just because of one man who most probably made some ex-gratia payments to our number one, or promised him some lucrative business deals for his family in Sudan, especially so that it is rich in oil reserves, can be the only reason why he is treated with such caution and for South Africa to actually become the laughing stock of the world for its non-adherence to judicial matters is a disgrace.\nFrom being respected post 1994 we have become the laughing stock of the world, and they rightfully say, ‘things in South Africa are done as the ANC dictates how it should be and there is no compliance to any law at all, they are a law on their own.’\nWhat a disgrace we have become and in the process confidence in our governance of this Country, sliding down and down the gutter almost reaching the bottom of it at this point in time.\nAnd all this just for financial and material benefits accrued unlawfully, irregularly right at the top.\nAre we going to renege on everything that we signed as accords to suit personal agendas?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:15:27.377+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
