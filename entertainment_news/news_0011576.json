By moniker alone, the record could act as a resolve to Gaslight's most recent album, 2014's \"Get Hurt.\"\nFallon will record with Butch Walker, whose producer credits include works from Fall Out Boy, Avril Lavigne and Fallon's pal Frank Turner. The album will be released via Island Records, as was \"Get Hurt.\"\nThe 35-year-old Red Bank native announced a crop of January shows, prefaced by three shows at Crossroads in Garwood Dec. 3-5. He will tour with Gaslight guitarist Alex Rosamilia, as well as Ian Perkins and Catherine Popper, with whom Fallon worked with on side project Molly and the Zombies.\nBobby Olivier may be reached at bolivier@njadvancemedia.com.
