Having ended their run on \"Daredevil\" in spectacular fashion earlier this summer, all industry eyes were wondering when writer Mark Waid and artist Chris Samnee would collaborate next. It turns out they're remaining with the \"house of ideas\", as both Comic Book Resources and Entertainment Weekly revealed on Friday (October 2) that the pair would reunite with the rest of their \"Daredevil\" team (colorist Matt Wilson and letterer Joe Caramagna) to relaunch the super spy's solo series next year.\nDespite being created by Stan Lee, Don Rico, and Don Heck in 1964, it seems that Natasha Romanova has never been more popular than she is now. Several big budget film appearances (as played by Scarlett Johansson) over the past five years will do that, as well a critically acclaimed solo series by Nathan Edmondson and Phil Noto. That series ran for twenty issues, which was the longest a Black Widow series has lasted. Waid and Samnee plan to set their series eight months later alongside the rest of the Marvel Universe. \"It’s similar to the way we approached Daredevil, in that we’re not picking up specifically from the end of the previous issue or specifically from any one moment. But we’re acknowledging that, and making use of the fact that what happened in the previous series happened, and using some of that stuff as a springboard,\" Waid has said. He added that this run benefits from all of the growing pains he and Samnee had to go through on \"Daredevil\", since Samnee was the third regular artist that volume had and thus had to hit the ground running: \"Being able to launch something from the ground zero with Chris means that he gets even more of a chance to put his vision into it.\"\nWaid continued to state that he and Samnee have been given a lot of freedom with Natasha, and they already have a \"big bad\" planned for her. They also plan to shift the tone from their \"Daredevil\" run by not having Natasha's narration carry through the series, as well as a renewed focus on her being a solo spy away from Iron Man and the rest of the Avengers. Long short on both adversaries of her own as well as a supporting cast, Waid plans to create new ones for her as well as bring in old ones from established comics.\nThere is a touch of irony that a creative team best known for a long run on \"Daredevil\" to move onto a \"Black Widow\" comic. From 1971 to 1975, she shared Daredevil's solo series (and the title itself) with him as his partner during Gerry Conway's run on the book. The pair have been loosely linked ever since. Placing this high profile team shows Marvel's interest and confidence in the Black Widow as a franchise; the company clearly expects lightening to strike twice here with this team. Waid wrote \"Daredevil\" from 2011-2015, with Samnee coming aboard last year. One can only hope their run on \"Black Widow\" will last as long and be just as heralded.", "external_links": ["http://www.ew.com/article/2015/10/02/marvel-new-black-widow-series", "http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/marvel-announces-black-widow-from-waid-samnee"], "published": "2015-10-05T05:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:41:05.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
