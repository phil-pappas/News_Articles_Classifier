Even as the change in formats should put India in a more confident state, it’s been close to a year that MS Dhoni -led India hasn’t won a One-Day International (ODI) series – be it the tri-series involving Australia and England, ICC World Cup or the three-match series against Bangladesh. The first ODI of the five-match series will be played at the Green Park in Kanpur on Sunday. The hosts have won nine of the 12 encounters at the venue so far. The city last hosted an ODI in 2013 when India beat West Indies. Since then, the Green Park has been under construction. However, mismanagement has resulted in the first ODI being a day encounter. While the Team Director Ravi Shastri has managed to forge a strong partnership with Virat Kohli which has brought in a fresh approach to the side, he hasn’t been able to do the same with limited-overs skipper Dhoni. The fire India had shown during the world cup was missing in the subsequent limited-overs series. India’s squad hasn’t undergone a drastic change since the world cup campaign. Amit Mishra and Gurkeerat Singh Mann are the only inclusions, at the expense of Ravindra Jadeja, who has been of-colour in international cricket. What approach they will look to take against the Proteas can be anyone’s guess. South Africa will field a much-stronger side for the ODIs, with frontline pacers Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel finding their place back into the side. AB de villiers will take over the captaincy of the 50over side from teammate and best friend Faf du Plessis. India ODI Squad: MS Dhoni (C), Virat Kohli (VC), Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Suresh Raina, Ajinkya Rahane, Ambati Rayudu, Stuart Binny, Gurkeerat Singh Mann, Axar Patel, R Ashwin, Amit Mishra, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohit Sharma, Umesh Yadav. South Africa ODI Squad: AB De Villiers (C), Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock, Faf Du Plessis, JP Duminy, David Miller, Farhaan Behardien, Chris Morris, Khaya Zondo, Aaron Phangiso, Imran Tahir, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Kyle Abbott, Kagiso Rabada. \n  9, 2015 4:25 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:21:40.418+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
