The Chicago Park District, having negotiated a $10 fee for a 99-year lease, was the first to deliver for Emanuel. Maybe you think $10 is a lot to ask of Lucas for a century's claim to some of the most prized land on Earth. But the \"Star Wars\" creator has to be relieved; Chicago's opening bid was to charge $1 every year .\nA day later, Emanuel's Plan Commission — yes, the alleged stewards of the city's Lakefront Protection Ordinance — sold out the lakefront. Next, a Chicago City Council committee. The full council surely will salute once City Hall resolves a tiff with the Chicago Bears, a company with its own rent-a-home that defiles the lakeshore with disfigured architecture.\nRemarkably, though, this deal isn't yet as done as Emanuel, Lucas et al. want the rest of us to believe. A lawsuit challenging the surrender of this public land to Lucas' private museum is very much alive before U.S. District Judge John Darrah. Friends of the Parks, the advocacy group that brought the suit, has its next day in his Chicago courtroom Nov. 10.\nRight here we could print several thick lawbooks about a wonderful if complex legal principle called public trust doctrine: The disputed site, between Soldier Field and McCormick Place, was recovered from the lake as landfill in the 1920s, and as such it has special protections. Among the issues before Darrah: Can Chicago, even with state approval, relinquish this particular land to satisfy Lucas' private ambitions? Have Illinois legislators who think they've given the Park District that approval actually done so? And would Lucas' lease give him more control over this submerged lake bottom than public trust doctrine permits?\nWe don't pretend to know Darrah's current thinking. But when he rejected City Hall's motion to quash the lawsuit seven months ago, the judge wrote that Friends of the Parks \"alleges enough facts to state that (City Hall and the Park District) intend to transfer the exclusive right to use and control the Museum Site to a private entity.\"\nMaybe Judge Darrah will launch Lucas' brazen land grab to a galaxy far, far away. We've suggested shuttling it to the James R. Thompson Center, which Gov. Bruce Rauner wants to sell. Prescient footnote to history: When that building opened in 1985, an architecture review in Time magazine said the out-of-place lump \"seems not so much to have risen in the Loop as to have landed there.\"\nGeorge Lucas, have we got a deal for you Editorial Board Gov. Bruce Rauner planted a \"for sale\" sign Tuesday on the James R. Thompson Center, angling to get a good price for taxpayers on the prime downtown real estate. His administration hopes to sell the building within the year and move government offices elsewhere.\nWatching Rauner make the announcement...\nGov. Bruce Rauner planted a \"for sale\" sign Tuesday on the James R. Thompson Center, angling to get a good price for taxpayers on the prime downtown real estate. His administration hopes to sell the building within the year and move government offices elsewhere.\nWatching Rauner make the announcement...\n(Editorial Board) Lucas' design resembling a white volcano does, though, bring us to Tribune architecture critic Blair Kamin's recent proposal: Tear down the shoreline's Berlin Wall — the stolid black Lakeside Center of McCormick Place. Kamin wrote that, \"Life and politics are about trade-offs. The mayor is hellbent on building the Lucas museum despite Friends of the Parks' federal lawsuit and warnings from this quarter that the museum will further clutter an already overbuilt stretch of Chicago's lakefront. So be it. He can make amends — and make history — by undoing the blunder of the Lakeside Center, which is the byproduct of an era that wrongly prioritized commerce and transportation over the traditional lakefront touchstones of nature, recreation and culture.\"\nTo which we would add: Lucas doesn't have to build his museum in order for Chicago to reclaim the Lakeside Center's swath of shoreline.\nWe acknowledge once again the Tribune's long (and long-ago) advocacy for constructing a convention center east of Lake Shore Drive; it's the namesake of Tribune owner and publisher Robert R. McCormick, who died 60 years ago. The building is architecturally significant but in need of costly technology upgrades. The biggest trade shows occupy its top floor. But its vast lower levels, as cynics who work there say, is where pillars go to die.\nReplacing the easterly building for a smaller modern structure west of the drive wouldn't only help McCormick Place. It would open the lakefront for something like the \"Burnham Sanctuary,\" a plan drafted pro bono by the urban design group of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the firm that designed the Hancock and Willis towers. The new public space would include paths, prairies and wetlands — welcoming habitat, that is, for humans and other migratory animals. If you're wondering: The designers who envisioned the Burnham Sanctuary (not to be confused with the nearby Burnham Nature Sanctuary) recommended putting parkland over the parking lot where Lucas wants to build; as the planners wrote in 2011, \"architecture has never been the right thing to do.\"\nReturning the Lakeside Center site to nature and erecting a smaller, techier replacement to the west would involve a wealth of government complications and perhaps a bond issue repaid by future convention revenues. We aren't sure this is the right way to proceed. It's early.\nWe are, though, convinced that the Lucas land grab should focus all of us not only on this threat to the lakefront but on the next private entity's proposal and all the ones after that.\nWe encourage the mayor to think big about giving Chicagoans more space on this crowded stretch of lakefront.\n George Lucas Rahm Emanuel Chicago City Hall Lucas Museum of Narrative Art Skidmore, Owings and Merrill LLP Editorials Opinion", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561d92c2/turbine/ct-thompson-center-sale-edit-1014-20151013", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562a848b/turbine/ct-lucas-museum-emanuel-lakefront-mccormick-place-edit-20151023"], "published": "2015-10-23T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:14:04.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
