He's fighting to bring a proper government to his country (although he's killing innocent farmers along the way). He's building an army of young boys (whom he kidnaps, abuses and rapes). \nHe's a good man. Just ask him. \nIn \"Beasts of No Nation\" he's also Idris Elba , who gives a terrifying performance – largely because the Commandant doesn't think he's terrifying at all, or even worthy of criticism. He has a cause, and his cause is just and his end justifies any means. \nAnd sadly, for most of the world, whether he's judged as a war criminal or a patriot in the end depends solely on who wins. \nDirector Cary Joji Fukunaga – who may be best known for the first season of \"True Detective,\" but also directed an interesting \"Jane Eyre\" and the moving \"Sin Nombre\" – begins his story calmly. \nAgu (the young, very believable Abraham Attah) and his family are middle-class Africans, living in a \"buffer zone\" in an unnamed country. Agu has an older brother, and a baby sister. His father is a teacher. His mother tends to them all. \nThen the war comes home. \nAgu's mother and baby sister flee to the nearest big city. The \"men\" – and Agu is probably all of 8 – stay behind. But then Agu's father and brother are killed in a sudden fight between soldiers and rebels, and Agu runs into the forest – where he's discovered by the Commandant and quickly \"drafted\" into his army. \nAnd this point the film marches – confidently, horrifyingly – into \"Lord of the Flies\" territory. \nAlthough the Commandant proudly sports two stars on his beret, and some military camo, the rest of his \"division\" are dressed in rags, feathers, cowrie shells. (One soldier, glimpsed early on, isn't dressed at all.) Military exercises are interrupted by magical ritual; strategic attacks melt into blood sacrifices. \nFukunaga's script – based on a novel by Uzodinma Iweala – keeps the focus on Agu (who occasionally narrates). It's hell, as seen through the eyes of a child, and it's harrowing – made all the more harrowing by Elba, who plays the Commandant as the ultimate abuser, preying on the most desperate, intimidating them with unpredictable violence and then keeping them hopeful with small words of praise. \nThat Elba seems certain to get some awards attention is welcome. That, traditionally, the Oscars pay the most attention to African-American men who play monsters, and women who play victims, is also in his favor, although not perhaps in cinema's. \nBut there is no doubt that predators like the Commandant exist, and there can be little debate over the merits of the power of \"Beasts of No Nation.\" The film goes on a little too long; the moment of hope it ends on seems overly optimistic. But it's not only a moving film but, far rarer, an important one, calling our attention to one war that never ends: The war on innocence. \nRatings note: The film contains sexual assaults, violence, nudity, substance abuse and strong language. 'Beasts of No Nation' (PG-13) Netflix/Bleecker Street (133 min.) Directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga. With Idris Elba, Abraham Attah.
