Malcolm-Jamal Warner, who played Theo Huxtable in The Cosby Show, has spoken about sex allegations against Bill Cosby. Picture: AP AP and Network Writers AP Email a friend \nTHE Cosby Show alum Malcolm-Jamal Warner says the series’ legacy is “tarnished” by the sexual assault allegations made against Bill Cosby. \n“My biggest concern is when it comes to images of people of colour on television and film, no matter what … negative stereotypes of people of colour, we’ve always had The Cosby Show to hold up against that. And the fact that we no longer have that, that’s the thing that saddens me the most because in a few generations the Huxtables will have been just a fairy tale,” said Warner, who starred as Cosby’s son, Theo Huxtable, on the long-running sitcom. Close ... Malcolm-Jamal Warner and Bill Cosby have remained friends over the years. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied \nWarner said he has been in touch with Cosby, but he would not comment on their conversations. \n“I think the things that we discussed really have to stay private between us. But it’s just a bad situation all around — for him, for his family, the women, their families, the legacy of the show,” said Warner during an interview on Thursday. Malcolm-Jamal Warner on The Cosby Show \nCosby admitted having extramarital relationships with several women, including some who now accuse him of sexual assault. He has never been charged with a crime. \nWarner, who won his first Grammy earlier this year for his work on Robert Glasper’s Jesus Children , is currently promoting his new album, Selfless , out now. Long career ... Malcolm-Jamal Warner, seen here in The List, says he was always determined not to end up as one of those ‘where are they now’ TV kids. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied \nHe describes the third record with his band Miles Long as “funky passionate vulnerability.” \nWarner is also filming American Crime Story: The People vs. O.J. Simpson , directed by Ryan Murphy. He plays Simpson’s friend Al “A.C.” Cowlings. \n“I grew up with a maniacal obsession with not wanting to be one of those ‘Where Are They Now’ kids,” said Warner of his busy year. “I feel very blessed to be able to have all of these avenues of expression … to be where I am now and finally at a place where I can let go of that worry about having a life after The Cosby Show .” \nThe cast of The Cosby Show have largely been quiet about the allegations against Cosby, \nJoseph C. Phillips , who played Martin Kendall, the husband of Cosby’s on-screen daughter Denise (Lisa Bonet), broke ranks, saying in July “of course Bill Cosby is guilty.” \nCosby Show stars have their say \nBILL COSBY (Cliff Huxtable) \n“No, no, we don’t answer that. There is no comment about that ... I don’t talk about it.” \nPHYLICIA RASHAD (Claire Huxtable) \n“This is not about the women. This is about something else. This is about the obliteration of legacy.” \nKEISHA KNIGHT PULLIAM (Rudy Huxtable) \n“I wasn’t there, that’s just not the man I know and I can’t speak to it”. \nRAVEN-SYMONE (Olivia Kendall) \nSpeaking on The View, “I don’t really like to talk about it that much because he’s the reason I’m on this panel in the first place. He gave me my first job.” \nJOSEPH C. PHILLIPS (Martin Kendall) \n“In 1989, my attitude was that if Bill was cheating on (wife) Camille, I am fairly certain Camille knew. Hey, if everyone who claimed to know actually knew, then certainly Camille knew, and had long ago made her peace with it.” \nMALCOLM JAMAL WARNER (Theo Huxtable) \n“He’s one of my mentors, and he’s been very influential and played a big role in my life as a friend and mentor,” Warner said. “Just as it’s painful to hear any woman talk about sexual assault, whether true or not, it’s just as painful to watch my friend and mentor go through this. “I can’t really speak on any of the allegations because obviously, I was not there. The Bill Cosby I know has been great to me and great for a lot of people. What he’s done for comedy and television has been legendary and history-making. What he’s done for the black community and education has been invaluable. That’s the Bill Cosby I know. I can’t speak on the other stuff.” Beloved family ...
