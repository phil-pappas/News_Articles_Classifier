People who have the courage of their convictions: great journalists, writers, artists … You know, one of the greatest problems we face today is people's self-awareness,\" he said naming Francis Bacon and Picasso.\nDaniel Craig does not consider his on-screen alter-ego a hero or role model. \nBut The Red Bulletin journalist, it would appear, was not counted in their number.\nThe sixth actor to play Ian Fleming's British secret service agent reportedly earnt £39 million ($83 million) for the latest Bond film Spectre was not about to indulge the idolatry that the franchise has attracted.\nWhen asked if he was \"the kind of guy who sticks around\", the British actor responded bluntly: \"Well, I've been married for four years\".\nCraig, the Sixth actor to play Bond, is reportedly the highest paid 007 in history. Photo: SMH \n\"What could we learn from James Bond that would help us in our day-to-day lives?\"\n\"[Thinks for a short while] Nothing,\" Craig replied.\nBond did have some endearing qualities, according to Craig.\nHe could sometimes be a gentleman who \"took care of business\" and opened doors for everyone, \"not just women\". (Craig neglected to mention that Bond was far more likely to throw you out a window.)\nBut these moments of fleeting redemption should not overshadow the innate misogyny of a character whose endurance was owed to his representation of \"the eternal struggle between good and evil\", Craig said.\nWhen The Red Bulletin journalist suggested the MI6 spy had become more \"chivalrous\" in the most recent films, Craig didn't back down.\n\"That's because we've surrounded him with very strong women who have no problem putting him in his place,\" he responded to the reporter, who at this stage we assume was sweating more than a Russian KGB agent in the Havana sun.\nBut the most withering response came in response to the assertion that Craig had \"gone one better\" by showing 007 \"succumbing to the charms of an older woman\", namely the 51-year-old Italian Actress Monica Bellucci.\n\"I think you mean the charms of a woman his own age,\" Craig said.\n\"We're talking about Monica Bellucci, for heaven's sake. When someone like that wants to be a Bond girl, you just count yourself lucky!\"\nSpectre , the 24th Bond movie, is released in Australia on November 12.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T14:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:34:15.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
