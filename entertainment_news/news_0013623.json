It evolved from the dagger and the earliest specimens date to 1600 BC. Most of us have seen sword fighting in movies, where weâ€™ve watched Samurai use them with graceful, dance like movements. In The Three Musketeers Movies, adapted from the original books, the trio often synchronized their group movements. Then a masked man entered the television scene thanks to the creativity of Walt Disney .\nThis is where many children became fans of Zorro in 1957, while sitting before a black and white circular Zenith television screen. This masked hero was an unlikely sort, played by the tall, dark and handsome Guy Williams .To many, his portrayal was the best to date, other fans prefer Duncan Regehr as their favorite television Zorro . However if we are talking about a favorite Movie Zorro, who could forget Antonio Banderas in The Mask of Zorro . But wait . . . there is a new Zorro on the scene who is scheduled to meet audiences for the first time live, on October 23, at the Old West Film Festival at the M7 Con , in Los Angeles, CA. This new Zorro is a handsome, charming gentleman and great actor, Alex Kruz .\nAs you may remember from past columns, Alex has been instructed in the art of fencing by Maestro Ramon Martinez . These men have showcased their sword fighting and acting talents in the new film short, Promisiunea ,which premieres at the Old West Film Festival at 3:00 pm on Friday, October 23, at the Los Angeles, Convention Center. Tickets are available at M7 Con , along with the schedule of all weekend events. Please plan to attend this convention and watch the duo as they fence live, on Friday, October 23.
