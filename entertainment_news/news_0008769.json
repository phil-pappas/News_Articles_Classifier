The new model also includes a full range of convenient features that address virtually every system integrator's needs.\n\"The ZA5000ES has been designed to provide solutions for practically any system integration requirement,\" said Yamato \"Tank\" Tanikawa, director, Home Entertainment & Sound, Sony Electronics. \"Additionally, its advanced audio and video performance make it the perfect complement for the new Ultra HD Blu-ray format, as well as other emerging 4K UHD platforms.\"\nImmersive Audio Support\nThe ZA5000ES is the first ES receiver compatible with both Dolby Atmos and DTS:X.* Using two additional amplifiers, these formats can support up to 11.1 channels of sound for the latest object-oriented audio sources that are now available from a growing number of platforms. The receiver also supports a long list of legacy surround formats, including Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio.\nThe ZA5000ES incorporates powerful DSP technology which utilizes a high speed clock to achieve unprecedented operational efficiency. A high performance 32-bit floating point processor is also used to optimize signal processing, along with shorter signal paths to reduce impedance and interference from digital noise. All of these processors are mounted, together with a high-grade electrolytic capacitor, on the receiver's power line to ensure an ample supply of clean power and optimal performance.\nTo complement this, the ZA5000ES includes Sony's latest D.C.A.C. EX technology with a new feature called Speaker Relocation. This compensates for less than ideal listening environments by closely simulating the sound field produced by optimally positioned and angled speakers.\nSuperb Sound Reproduction\nAdditionally, the ZA5000ES can deliver High Resolution Audio over HDMI. Sound quality is also improved by a newly developed preamplifier circuit that reproduces high resolution music with more accurate response and greater detail. All preamplifier functions are performed by a new IC which provides faster response time, higher signal-to-noise and reduced thermal interference. There are also refinements such as independent power supply wiring with low loss gold bond wire.\nTo further enhance sound quality, the ZA5000ES utilizes a linear wideband power amplifier and highly efficient aluminum heat sink, a high capacity transformer with localized power supplies, a low phase noise precision crystal oscillator, and sonically tuned audio grade resistors.\nThe ZA5000ES also incorporates Sony's highly regarded ES Build Quality, which features 'Frame and Beam' full box construction that increases rigidity. When combined with the receiver's off-set feet, this helps eliminate airborne vibration.\nAdvanced Video Quality\nThe ZA5000ES includes six HDMI inputs and two outputs that provide full HDCP 2.2 compliance and supports the latest 4K 60P (4:4:4:) Ultra HD content. It can also distribute both 4K video and multichannel audio simultaneously to two different zones. Unlike conventional receivers, the ZA5000ES is even compatible with the new BT.2020 wide color gamut standard for future applications.\nAdditionally, the ZA5000ES can upscale video to 4K 24P and is one of the first receivers that can support High Dynamic Range (HDR) sources. A special test pattern is also included for verifying 4K connectivity.\nUnprecedented Flexibility\nThe ZA5000ES features a built-in graphic user interface (GUI) which offers a visual confirmation of system set-up; while cursor keys on the receiver's front panel provide full operability - even without the supplied Remote Commander. For the utmost convenience, a special in-ceiling speaker mode can also \"virtually\" relocate the front and center speakers around the screen.\nIn addition, an 8-port Ethernet hub is included on the receiver's back panel, along with two Power over Ethernet (PoE) ports. A full complement of digital and analog inputs are also provided, along with redesigned gold-plated speaker terminals that support the latest audiophile cables.\nThe ZA5000ES provides access to system integration protocols via a special PING button on the front panel. There's also web browser control plus cloud-based remote monitoring capability for Ihiji users. All of these settings can be saved to a flash drive and reloaded at any time using the USB interface located behind the receiver's removable front cover.\nThe STR-ZA5000ES comes with a 5-year limited parts and labor warranty and includes a multi-function Remote Commander that supports a variety of discrete operating codes. It will be available in Spring 2016 at a suggested retail price of $2,799 .\n*Available via firmware upgrade.\nSony is exhibiting at the CEDIA Sony Booth #3701.
