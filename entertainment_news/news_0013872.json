(Photo: EllenTube) \nYouTube sensation and super-fan Mila might not be so devastated anymore after a surprise, televised meeting with the man of her dreams, Adam Levine. It was epic. \nThe three-year-old made news earlier this month when a video went viral as Mila appeared adorably devastated from her car seat to find out that The Voice star had married. <!--iframe--> \nIt all came to an amazing new twist on The Ellen DeGeneres Show Friday, when DeGeneres spoke to Mila and her mother. Then Levine himself stepped out from behind the curtain, naturally without Victoria Secrets model wife Behati Prinsloo. \nLevine presented Mila with a flower and a hug. \nIt was an amazing ending to the story, made even better because Mila suddenly went incredibly shy in front of the man she plans to marry. Sitting on the couch next to Levine, Mila hid in her mother's arms. \n\"She's over it,\" Levine cracked, pointing out that \"everybody in the world,\" including his wife, sent him the Mila heartbreak video. \nAdam Levine and his shy fan Mila. (Photo: EllenTube) \n\"It was kind of heartbreaking but so unbelievably cute,\" said Levine. \nMila did make out well in the whole deal. She met her dream man and Ellen presented her with a specially-made Levine super-fan outfit, with \"Mila + Adam 4 Eva\" written on it, covered in pictures of the heartthrob. \nLevine joked that he has an outfit just like it at home.
