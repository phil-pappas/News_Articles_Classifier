The movie didn't have anything like the budget of future Bond films, including the upcoming \"Spectre\" which has its World Premiere on Monday Oct. 26, 2015, in London. Connery would play Bond in five further authorized films, before returning from a 12-year hiatus to star in the unofficial \"Never Say Never Again\" in 1983.
