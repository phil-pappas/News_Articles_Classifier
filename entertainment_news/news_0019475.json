By Lucy O'Brien \nEnjoying the beta for Star Wars Battlefront? Good news! EA has extended it by a day. \nThere's a flipside however; the extra time is for technical tests, meaning you may experience connectivity issues from Monday 12th October through to the 13th. As per community manager Mathew Everett (@Sledgehammer70) on the official Star Wars Battlefront forums: \n\"Hope you’re enjoying the Star Wars Battlefront beta and thank you for playing – every time you log on, it’s helping us ensure the experience is going to be great at launch. As we get into the late stages of the beta, we will begin conducting further technical tests on our infrastructure. \nThese additional tests will start on Monday, October 12 and will run thru Tuesday, October 13th, which will add an additional day to the open Beta. These tests are to help us find some extreme scenarios, and that means some players may experience occasional issues such as being kicked from the game or losing connectivity. This is all being done in the name of shoring up our infrastructure before we launch on November 17th. \nPlease continue to provide your feedback around the Beta and we look forward to seeing you on the battlefront in November.\" \nStill, an unstable extra day is better than none at all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T02:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:51:38.252+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
