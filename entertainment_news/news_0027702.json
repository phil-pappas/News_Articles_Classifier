Man on wire! \nIf only. \nIf only, for the benefit of other filmmakers exploring the same material, we could un-see a great film and clear our memories of it. One such film is the 2008 documentary \"Man on Wire,\" James Marsh's account of what happened the morning of Aug. 7, 1974, when French aerialist Philippe Petit wire-walked between the twin towers of the World Trade Center. \nEight times, he crossed that wire, 1,350 feet above the streets of lower Manhattan. The act of trespassing was not legal and involved all sorts of disguises, accomplices, dodges and \"spy work,\" as Petit referred to it later in his book \"To Reach the Clouds,\" upon which the new film \"The Walk\" was based. \nMarsh's documentary won the Oscar for best documentary, and it deserved more â€” a best picture nomination, at least. So. Where does that leave \"The Walk,\" director Robert Zemeckis' fancy, fictionalized docudrama version of the grandest act of poetic terrorism ever committed on American soil? \nI cannot say how I'd feel about \"The Walk\" if I'd never seen \"Man on Wire,\" because I did see \"Man on Wire,\" and I can't un-see it. I love it. I can only say \"The Walk\" struck me as an honorable good try of an also-ran, though with some lovely things to offer, especially when the preamble and preparations and backstage dramas wind down and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who portrays Petit, takes that first step. The Walk (Trailer) \nTrailer for \"The Walk.\" Sept. 30, 2015 (Screenplay) \nTrailer for \"The Walk.\" Sept. 30, 2015 (Screenplay) See more videos \nThe script by Zemeckis and Christopher Browne positions Gordon-Levitt (sporting a heavily worn French accent) as narrator and host of his own story, speaking to us from the torch of the Statue of Liberty. In predominantly black-and-white flashbacks, Paris street performer Petit plies his slack-rope skills wherever he can elude the cops long enough to gather a crowd. Then, at the dentist one day, he sees in a magazine a picture of the soon-to-be-completed World Trade Center. An idea flowers. \nIn cheery, bold and bright tones, \"The Walk\" follows Petit as he enlists his colleagues, including his lover played by Charlotte Le Bon, on the adventure of a lifetime. While they case the towers in New York, Petit's circus mentor, played by Ben Kingsley, wonders back home if his prize pupil will ever meet his ambitions. Petit did, of course.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T15:24:41.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
