He's much cuter! And I'd have to say Alexsandr has been a bit of a diva, which is no surprise given his fame in the UK.\"\nKidman revealed they had not yet tried to get her to eat any grubs but added: \"No, but because I'm Australian we're used to that kind of thing and I've even been known to try a witchetty grub ... see I could've gone on I'm a Celebrity and won it! I wouldn't have to be bribed or anything. I'd be happy to eat the witchetty grubs!\"\nThe 40-second advert sees some fur flying as Kidman arrives at Aleksandr's house to take his meerkat pal Sergei on a date to the movies.\nSneaky Sergei uses his Meerkat Movies 2 for 1 cinema tickets to take Kidman on the date, leaving Aleksandr outraged.\nPromoted stories The meerkats aside, she is currently starring in the West End theatre production of Photograph 51, playing Rosalind Franklin.\n\"I'm doing Photograph 51 in London which I'm excited to do,\" she said.\n\"I haven't been on stage since The Blue Room but I'm also really glad because it's about Rosalind Franklin, who's a really interesting female scientist who was very instrumental in the discovery of DNA.\"\nThe star called London her \"second home\" because she spends so much time in the city.\n\"My favourite time of year is actually when I'm doing plays.
