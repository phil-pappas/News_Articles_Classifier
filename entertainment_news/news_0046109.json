Comment By Rachael DevaneyContributing writer Posted Oct. 1, 2015 at 2:00 am Updated at 10:21 AM It’s October, so it must be time to fall … in love with Cape Cod art and culture. Residents and visitors will be able to do just that through the many events that make up the Arts Foundation of Cape Cod's eighth annual \"Fall for the Arts\" festival . The monthlong celebration of culture will feature hundreds of special events across the 15 towns of the Cape, as well as Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket. The schedule includes live performances by local musicians, special exhibits, arts activities for kids, readings and lectures, theater shows, plus plein-air painter workshops, and guided art and heritage walks. The foundation will also sponsor its annual concert series, which includes a concert by Cape Conservatory's CJazz at JazzFest Falmouth's stroll Friday, a show featuring Jo&Co at the Yarmouth Seaside Festival, and a presentation of The Bert Jackson Trio at \"Capture the Cape\" in Orleans. The concert series also includes art and education elements, especially with its CJazz performance. Christine Mascott, the foundation’s director of programs and events, says the group's student musicians have various skill levels and will play among top jazz performers, including three-time Grammy Award nominee Denise Donatelli. “CJazz performed last year and they are really talented and worked well together to pull off a really wonderful showcase and concert,\" Mascott says. \"Because their skill levels and age vary, they are a real reflection of the Cape’s wonderfully talented musical community.” In addition to the concert series, Mascott says, many \"favorites\" will reappear as part of this year's overall festival. \"Most of the offerings are family-friendly and ... a lot of the most popular activities revolve around Halloween and the holidays,\" Mascott says. \"We will still hold the Sandwich Glass Museum's 'Pumpkin Fest,' which will feature hand-blown-glass pumpkins and that is a huge hit. “All of our member theaters have also scheduled wonderful events like 'Pirates of Penzance,’ which is being produced by Cotuit Center for the Arts, and 'Mr. Burns, a post electric play,' which is coming out of the Cape Rep Theatre. There are a lot of amazing events happening and I think everyone will find something they love.\" With hundreds of organizations across the area involved – including ArtsFalmouth, the Yarmouth Art Guild, Cape Cod Museum of Art and Art Week Boston – Julie Wake, the new executive director of the foundation, says it's the widespread collaboration that makes Fall for the Arts successful. \"The foundation has always been collaborative, but I think this year you will see much more open collaboration. It's become one of our main priorities as an agency to spread the arts as far as we can, while also instilling business partnerships that have opened up other opportunities the community will enjoy,\" Wake says. \"Being a bit more strategic about the connections we are making helps to further our mission as an agency and inform the public of our many programs that impact the community throughout the year.\" For Wake, it's her first time organizing \"Fall for the Arts,\" since she took her post in August. The foundation – Barnstable County's regional arts agency that serves individual artists, cultural centers, fine and performing arts groups, businesses, and cultural and historical establishments – is strong in its mission, she says, and she's looking forward to the year ahead. Wake has been meeting with various arts organizations, seeing their work and trying to figure out how the foundation can support them. With \"a lot of balls in the air,\" Wake says at the foundation, \"we want to both partner with the community, as well as provide organizations with advocacy, workshops, promotion and support.\" And as the many \"Fall for the Arts\" activities surge ahead, Wake says she is looking forward to \"supporting and strengthening\" visibility, which will help showcase a \"wonderful shoulder season\" for the Cape. \"We are so grateful for all our partnerships that have helped 'Fall for the Arts' go far beyond the arts community. Over the years, it has turned into an arts and culture celebration that engages museums, artists, libraries, galleries, musicians and even restaurants and hotels,\" she says. \"As far as I'm concerned, it really is the best time of year and tourists come specifically to the Cape to enjoy these events. The festival has become a real fall cultural destination.\" » STAY INFORMED", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T18:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T03:48:47.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
