It will make its debut Friday at Bourbon House 45 in Warren, and at Antone’s in Boardman on Oct. 23. \nIn addition to Skowron and Pepey, who handles drums, the band consists of keyboardist and co-founder Rick Earnhardt (Vegas band); guitarist Tom Jacobs (Leddfoot); bassist Ken Pfregner (In Veritas); and guitarist Dan Newman (Bon Journey). \n“We’re going for a big sound,” said Pepey, who led the popular Valley party band No Xcuse for years before it disbanded earlier this year. “The main goal was to approach songs that other bands could not, or would not, attempt due to lack of instrumentation or personnel. Having six members with a keyboard player is what will set Epic apart.” \nAfter No Xcuse’s breakup, Pepey said he entertained several offers from other bands but held out for the right one. When he heard about Epic, he knew it was just what he was looking for. “I like to joke that this is the type of band that if I saw out, I would be mad that I wasn’t in it,” he said. \nSkowron still has a lot of fans from his days with Noisy Mama, the Youngstown band that flirted with national fame in the ’90s. He also sensed that the stars were lining up from the moment he met Earnhardt. \n“I wanted to play with guys that I never played with, who don’t talk about the old days and who just move forward,” said Skowron. “The chemistry was there. In this band, everyone has done it before, and there is a great work ethic.” \nFor some bands, rehearsals can be a mess. But that’s not the case with Epic. \n“We are hitting the ground running,” said Skowron. “The rehearsals are patterned and very well run. ... It’s a really good group of people who are at the top of their game.” \nPepey agrees. \n“Everyone in the band is his own worst critic,” he said. “We’re not complacent. There is a huge effort to get that sound and be comfortable with it.” \nStoked by teasers on its website (epicbandrocks.com) and Facebook page, anticipation has been building among Valley rock fans. \n“There is a lot of buzz out there for sure,” said Pepey. “They know the personnel. Some are dying of curiosity.” \nThe band has been champing at the bit to get on a stage, and the first two gigs – at Bourbon House and Antone’s Banquet Center – should draw sizable crowds. \nSkowron’s aspirations for Epic extend beyond the band itself. \n“We want to create a scene [in the Mahoning Valley],” said Skowron. “We’re trying to team with other bands to get them to realize that this area is a hotbed of great musicians. Antone’s recently started booking shows, and we’d like to get other bands to play there.” Other stories of interest", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:17:09.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
