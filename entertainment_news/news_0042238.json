He plays Kaulder, an immortal warrior who travels the Earth tracking down rogue witches and working to maintain the balance between man and those who possess the power of magic. When a close friend is attacked by a powerful user of an ancient magic, it brings him back to the beginning of his journey in which he killed that Witch Queen and gained his curse of immortality. \nWhen the first trailer for The Last Witch Hunter was released I thought it was a joke. Vin Diesel hunting witches with a flaming sword? This can't be a real movie and if it is a real movie, it can't be good. Then a strange thing happened. The more I saw the trailer, the more I was intrigued. I don't know if it was Vin Diesel wielding a flaming sword, if it was the idea of him staring in a fantasy film, or pure curiosity. I can't put my finger on it but something was drawing me to this film. Maybe it's Vin Diesel's charisma? You have to admit that he's not the best actor. Even in his far of action movies, there are others that are far better but he does have an on-screen (and off-screen) persona that draws people in. \nTrailer Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuG2JUgs_8 \nSo, here are the some of the questions, I anticipate you asking about The Last Witch Hunter : \nIs The Last Witch Hunter a joke? \nNo, it's a real movie that actually appears to be an attempt to launch a new Vin Diesel led franchise. \nThe trailer makes the The Last Witch Hunter look like a really silly fantasy movie/cheap comic book movie. Does it come across as silly or cheap? \nI think if you've bought a ticket to see this movie, you're not concerned about it being silly or cheap. It's actually a little bit of both yet neither of them. It has some effects that look pretty cheap or rehashed from other films. Its silliness is only in the plot of witches living among us, a Witch Queen that wants to destroy humanity, and an immortal witch hunter. Which means, if you've bought a tickets, you've already bought into the silliness of it and it won't bother you. If anything, this movie creates its own film world with its own rules and stays within those boundaries. Listen to 911 tapes: Deer attacks family, leaving one with severe injuries \nIs The Last Witch Hunter a good movie? \nI have to say, yes. It's not a great movie but it was very easy and fun to watch. It didn't ask me to buy in too much and it was never confusing. It was easy to suspend my disbelief and just sit back and watch. It's not a movie that I would tell you to rush out and see but if you're looking for a really simple movie to watch over the weekend, this is it. \nI'd even say that I liked it and I think it could be a movie that I'd sit and watch every time it was on TV on a Sunday afternoon.
