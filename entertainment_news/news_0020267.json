CONTRIBUTED By Russell Florence Jr. Contributing Writer \nMurder, feuds, manipulation, and all that jazz energizes the sexy, scintillating and cynical world of John Kander, Fred Ebb and Bob Fosse’s classic 1975 musical “Chicago” which begins performances Thursday, Oct. 29 at Wright State University.​ \nBolstered in popularity by its Tony Award-winning 1996 Broadway revival (and its distinction as the longest-running American musical in Broadway history) and the winner of six 2002 Academy Awards including Best Picture, “Chicago” spins a surrealistic web of rivalry and fame during the Roaring Twenties. Merry murderesses Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly, inmates of the Cook County Jail, vigorously vie for the attention and affection of the fickle, overzealous media but not without crucial assistance from super slick lawyer Billy Flynn and earthy prison matron Mama Morton. \n“Bob Fosse’s view of the world was of a place that could absolutely be better but is deeply corrupted and cynical,” said Joe Deer, the director whose WSU staging of “Chicago” 18 years ago launched the organization’s stellar Musical Theatre Department and memorably starred pop recording artist and 2015 Olivier Award nominee Nicole Scherzinger. “I don’t think Fosse loved cynicism but he certainly understood its attraction. He also understood how to make cynicism incredibly attractive and force the audience to confront the reality of how seduced we are by it.” \nRoxie and Velma’s competitive tendencies fuel the humor and bite within the story which continues to mirror contemporary patterns. In fact, Deer feels the show currently resonates to greater degrees as presidential debates and pop culture influences stake their claim in the minds of the public. \n“We’re in an election cycle right now and our nation is very polarized,” he explained. “The media has become lapdogs for this kind of reaction. The media uses its hunger for a good story or even a Kardashian-type story to its own ends.” \nThe principal cast includes Bailey Rose as Roxie Hart, Caroline Chisholm as Velma Kelly, Jordan Adams as Billy Flynn, Katie Momenee as Mama Morton, Tyler Simms as Amos Hart, and Cody Westbrook as Mary Sunshine. The artistic team includes choreographer Teressa Wylie McWilliams (“Hairspray,” “Hot Mikado”), music director Scot Woolley, guest scenic designer and Muse Machine alum Adam Koch, guest costumer Michelle Sampson, lighting designer Matthew P. Benjamin, properties by John Lavarnway, and sound designer James Dunlap. \nKander and Ebb’s fantastic score, remarkably blending vaudevillian sensibilities with witty pastiche, includes “The Cell Block Tango,” “Roxie,” “We Both Reached For the Gun,” “Mr. Cellophane,” “Razzle Dazzle,” and “Nowadays.” \n“Every song has a rich, multilayered perspective as a song that serves the story and advances the plot while also being perfectly in the style of an authentic vaudeville act or at least the expression of a vaudeville act,” Deer said. “The score is so smart. I love great craft, and this show has perfectly constructed scenes leading into perfectly constructed songs. You can’t want better than what Kander and Ebb have provided. They were a prolific team and ‘Chicago’ is perfect.” \nHOW TO GO \nWhat: “Chicago” \nWhere: Festival Playhouse of the Creative Arts Center at Wright State University, 3640 Col.
