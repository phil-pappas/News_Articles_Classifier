A video on DeGeneres’ show shows Smith training other young boys. In a distinct Jamaican accent, Smith yelled, “No weakness! Min nuh do weakness!” He says anti-bullying efforts are what inspired him. “What made me start is that I go around the neighborhood, and I look to see if kids like exercising. When I see that other kids bully them, that’s why I started exercising. So I don’t get bullied. I had a cousin that was bullied about his size and weight so I had to do something. I’ve got to be fit and strong.” He explained how to do a push-up— his favorite exercise— correctly. Smith was anything but modest, telling DeGeneres he does 90 push-ups a day. When asked about his dream job, Smith said he wants to be a personal trainer and a basketball player. His other dream was to challenge Usain Bolt. That’s when DeGeneres surprised the young boy with an unexpected guest—the Jamaican track star himself. After busting out a few push-ups with the famous runner, Smith dared Bolt to race on a makeshift track outside. “Come on Usain, don’t be scared of me!” Smith yelled. Just before the two reached the finish line, Bolt caught a cramp in his leg, granting Smith the victory. \nThe Face-off of the Century happens today on @TheEllenshow..
