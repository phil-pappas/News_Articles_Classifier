And it seems The Bachelorette producers were also trying to cut costs. \nDuring last night’s finale, when Sam Frost chose Sasha Mielczarek as her beau, she wore a dress identical to a gown previously worn by The Bachelor intruder Rachel Moore during her first meeting with Sam Wood. \nThe hand-embroidered Philippa Galasso gown retails for $6,320 and is encrusted with Swarovski beads.

Source: Channel 10 \nThe 29-year-old food blogger was brought in as an intruder towards the end of the season, along with runner-up Lana Jeavons-Fellows. \nRachel was unpopular with viewers and was soon eliminated from the show. She was later accused of “fat shaming” fellow contestant Nina Rollestone \n“Nina’s got no concern, she eats junk food and she’s trying to get a guy,” Moore said in a piece to camera. \n“Nina would brag about how she doesn’t like health and fitness and she doesn’t work out and she eats junk food. If Sam wants all of that, that’s his deal.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:59:25.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
