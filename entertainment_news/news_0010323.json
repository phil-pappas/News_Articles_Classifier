In his studio, he mixes samples with invited musicians, computer and duduk (Armenian instrument) to sketch a musical landscape going from India to the Balkans.\nAfter a few remarked apparitions on compilations (Combat Dub II, French Dub System, I Dub You), his first album 'Dub works (in mysterious waves)' comes out in May 2005. It had excellent feedbacks from the public and the press. On tour, he crossed Slovenia, Morocco, Switzerland, Bosnia, Germany, Norway, Turkey, Serbia, Belgium, Italy, Sweden, Czech Republica as well as Kosova. That gave him the opportunity to meet very inspiring musicians.\nThe concert is going to be staged on October 9 (8.30 pm) at Humming Tree, 949, 12th Main Road, Indiranagar.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T17:31:51.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
