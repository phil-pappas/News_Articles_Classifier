We have been told by several mortgage lenders that they can’t refinance our mortgages to take advantage of the current low rates due to the rec lease. What can we do?\nWith a recreational lease, the ownership and management of the rec facilities are kept separate from ownership and control of the condo association. In this arrangement, a separate business manages the clubhouse and pool, and individual unit owners pay dues to this company in addition to the condo association.\nSome rec leases are written in such a way that the lender is liable for payments missed by a delinquent unit owner. As a result, many institutional lenders won’t touch these communities.\nYou should be able to find a specialty lender, but expect to pay a higher interest rate to compensate for the additional risk. Fortunately, these communities usually have terrific amenities to make up for the extra hassle and expense.\nIt’s critical for prospective buyers to fully research developments for issues such as this. Information about how a rec lease might affect you is found in your association’s documents, making this yet another in the long list of good reasons to be familiar with your community’s rules.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T14:50:30.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
