Hebert Two colleges rescind Cosby's degrees 1  /  2 Back to Gallery Two more colleges announced Thursday they have rescinded honorary degrees given to Bill Cosby , adding to a growing list of schools distancing themselves from the entertainer embroiled in allegations of sexual assault.\nTufts University in Medford, Mass., said it withdrew an honorary doctorate of arts it conferred on Cosby in 2000, along with an award given in 2011 for excellence in children's media.\nBaltimore's Goucher College , meanwhile, said it decided to revoke an honorary degree it gave to Cosby when he was commencement speaker in 2001.\nBoth schools said they had notified Cosby of their actions.\nCourt documents unsealed in July show the 78-year-old Cosby admitting extramarital relationships with several women, some of whom accuse him of sexual assault.\nCosby has never been charged with a crime.\nThursday's revocations came a day after Pennsylvania's Lehigh University rescinded an honorary degree given in 2005.\nTufts' board of trustees said in a statement it decided to withdraw the honor after concluding there was \"a substantial basis\" to discredit the accomplishments for which Cosby was recognized. The board said it took the step after \"lengthy and serious consideration.\"\nTufts President Anthony Monaco said in an email to the university community that Cosby has shown \"a lack of character and integrity\" that does not represent the school's values.\nGoucher President Jose Antonio Bowen said he and that school's trustees met Wednesday and \"unanimously decided that Cosby's admitted actions are in direct violation of values Goucher holds dear, including our community principles of respect, communication, and responsibility.\"\nSeveral other schools, including Brown, Fordham, Marquette, Baylor and Pennsylvania's Wilkes University , previously pulled their Cosby degrees. In December, amid widening allegations, Cosby resigned from the board of trustees of Temple University in Philadelphia.\nThe University of Massachusetts-Amherst also has cut ties with Cosby, who earned a master's degree and a doctorate in education there.\n— Associated Press \nWillie Nelson shows moved over illness \nCountry star Willie Nelson has rescheduled two shows and canceled another due to an unspecified health issue.\nNelson and Merle Haggard were scheduled to perform Thursday and Friday, but South Carolina and Virginia dates were rescheduled and a show in Reading, Pa., on Saturday was canceled.\nA statement on his Facebook page said the 82-year-old Nelson was feeling under the weather. His publicist said the tour is scheduled to resume on Sunday, Oct. 18, at the American Roots Music Festival in Raleigh, N.C.\nThe two country icons are touring together after releasing a duets album earlier this year called \"Django and Jimmie.\"\n— Associated Press \nSnooki book slams Gov. Chris Christie \nFormer \"Jersey Shore\" star Nicole \"Snooki\" Polizzi doesn't have happy memories of meeting New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie \nIn a book published this week, Snooki recalls that Christie's expression was \"full of hate\" after she introduced herself in 2013 when both were on the boardwalk in Seaside Heights. Their tense encounter was caught on video and recounted in Snooki's \"Strong is the New Sexy,\" in a passage titled \"The Governor of New Jersey Tried to Eat Me.\" Joking about the size of Christie, a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, she writes that he outweighed her by \"a thousand pounds.\"\n— Associated Press \nActor John Stamos faces driving charge \nProsecutors have charged John Stamos with driving under the influence of drugs after his arrest earlier this year in Beverly Hills.\nThe \"Full House\" star was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence by Beverly Hills police on June 12. He was charged Wednesday and the case was announced Thursday by Los Angeles prosecutors.\nThe charging document does not identify the drug Stamos was allegedly using. \nStamos was hospitalized for a possible medical condition after he was stopped, and police said officers had determined he was driving while impaired.\nThe 52-year-old actor now stars in the Fox series \"Grandfathered.\" \"Full House\" aired on ABC from 1987 to 1995 and is scheduled to be rebooted by Netflix next year.\nStamos' publicist did not immediately return messages.\n— Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T00:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:32:46.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
