Photo: Alex Mayes\nFormer Centenary of Canberra general manager Adam Stankevicius will head up artsACT and Events ACT as the new director of the two agencies.\nMr Stankevicius is expected to begin in the new role in coming weeks, after his appointment was announced on Thursday.\n\"I am absolutely thrilled to accept the appointment as Director artsACT and Events ACT, at this point in the growth and maturing of Canberra's cultural landscape,\" Mr Stankevicius said.\n\"As a devoted Canberra enthusiast, I am very much looking forward to working with Canberra's cultural sector to create great art, engage with arts and events audiences, and strengthen their contribution to the Canberra aesthetic, economy and community.\"\nAdvertisement Former artsACT director David Whitney retired from the role in July after eight years at the helm.\nThe agency's arts policy manager Sam Tyler worked as acting director since August .\nThe combined arts/events position is a new role but both agencies have often worked in the same area of government, a spokeswoman for the Economic Development Directorate said.\nPreviously Events ACT staff reported directly to the deputy director-general arts, business, events, sport and tourism.\nDespite the restructure, the spokeswoman said both agencies would remain separate and their focus would be unchanged, but would benefit from working more closely together.\n\"The ACT is a small jurisdiction and it is important to make sure that government is delivering services to the community as effectively and efficiently as possible,\" she said.\n\"Having one director with responsibility for both agencies means we will be able to leverage the synergies between the two.\"\nMr Stankevicius said it was a privilege to lead the \"amazing\" artsACT and Events ACT teams.\nAs head of the Centenary of Canberra in 2013 he oversaw the cultural community events and environmental program.\nHe has held a number of senior executive positions across a wide range of social, governance and economic policy and program areas in the ACT and Australian governments and the non-government sector over the past 20 years, the spokeswoman said.\nHe has also been a senior policy and media adviser to parliamentarians across the political spectrum.\nHe has been involved with a range of national and ACT community organisations in the housing, health, youth, consumer and arts sectors, including the Board of Ausdance ACT in 2006 and the ACT Council of Cultural and Community Organisations in the 1990s.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:14:43.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
