In this film, a college-going sportsman becomes a lethal gangster after his girlfriend dies in an unfortunate incident. The film traces his journey from being a simple boy in love to becoming a completely violent and cold-blooded gangster,” said Khanna. Burly newcomer Akhilesh Verma plays the role of Balbeer, the lover-turned-gangster, who is out to gain revenge for the murder of his lover Riya. The film also stars Oviya Helen, a well-known actress down South, and Naina Aswal in lead roles. “Gangaajal” and “Golmaal” series fame Mukesh Tiwari is one of the notable artists in the starcast in an out-and-out serious role, unlike his comic acts in “Golmaal” series. About the starcast comprising newcomers, Khanna said: “The script didn’t have space for established stars. We needed a certain kind of rawness for the film. I saw this raw spark in Akhilesh, while Oviya and Naina bring out certain innocence and sincerity with their performances. At the same time, the vast amount of experience of Mukesh Tiwari and some other actors perfectly sync in the film and look extremely apt.” The music has been composed by newcomer composer Pranav Ayaan, but the album features some popular singers which includes “Mar Jaava” singer Shruti Pathak, “Jashn-e-Bahaaran” singer Javed Ali and “Tum Jo Aaye Zindagi Mein” singer Tulsi Kumar among other talented singers. “Revenge stories in Bollywood have been going on since decades, a lot of which looks the same. But I’ve attempted to give a completely different treatment to an emotional revenge story, which I’m sure will be appreciated,” Khanna added. “Yeh Ishq Sarfira” has been produced by Sushila Dhaniram Tokas and Ashraf Ali, under the banner Rahul Productions Pvt Ltd and A.K. Film Production House . Related Posts", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T21:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:32:06.173+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
