Stine's \"Goosebumps\" series of kid-horror books isn't that they are overly gruesome gateways to the occult, as certain hysterical school librarians shrieked upon banning them back in their 1990s heyday. Rather, it's that they are all just so repetitive, so predictable and, librarians be darned, so tame.\nEven with such hard-to-resist titles as \"Night of the Living Dummy,\" \"Say Cheese and Die!\" and \"The Cuckoo Clock of Doom\" -- which have proven to be catnip to pre-teens -- the \"Goosebumps\" books are built around a mass-produced, by-the-numbers quality that makes it all too easy for parents and teachers to look down their noses at them as so much Scholastic schlock.\nOn the other hand, they got kids reading -- and they still are, with an astounding 350 million copies in print, and counting. That's as many as the books of Stephen King (to whom Stine is often unfavorably compared) and ranks it just behind \"Harry Potter\" and above \"Nancy Drew\" on the list of best-selling book series of all time.\nGiven those numbers, it was inevitable we'd eventually get a big-screen take on Stine's writings. It arrives this week, with director Rob Letterman's \"Goosebumps,\" a hyperactive romp bursting from the seams with special effects and starring a scenery-chewing Jack Black as a fictional version of Stine.\nIt's also just what fans of the book series should expect. That is, while wholesome in its own macabre way, it is every bit as repetitive, every bit as predictable and -- librarians be darned -- every bit as tame as the book series on which it's based. And all without the added benefit of getting kids to read.\nBuilt around a parade of notable monsters plucked from the pages of Stine's books -- Fifi the Vampire Poodle, the Werewolf of Fever Swamp, the Invisible Boy, and, most prominently, Slappy the ventriloquist's dummy -- the kid-friendly \"Goosebumps\" movie might ignite a spark of nostalgia in the younger segment of the coveted 18-to-49 demographic who remember sitting up late at night and terrifying themselves with such tales as \"The Haunted School\" (tagline: \"They're watching you learn ... the hard way\").\n'Goosebumps' movie trailer, starring Jack Black Action-comedy opens Oct. 16, 2015\nLittler ones might also be tickled by Black's slapstick-y, Muppet-like antics. For everyone else, though, \"Goosebumps\" promises to be something of a slog, benefitting from a fun tone reminiscent of \"Jumanji\" -- particularly early on -- but one that quickly devolves into a frantic but lazily plotted chase movie.\nUnless, that is, you enjoy seeing Black overact for all he's worth -- and with a peculiar accent that some body really should have advised him to abandon before shooting started -- while computer-animated monsters slaver and slobber on all sides.\nHe plays a fictional, curmudgeonly version of Stine in Letterman's film, but one with a secret. Turns out, his books have been written with a little supernatural help -- and the monsters contained in their pages aren't as fictional as one might hope. As long as the original manuscripts stay closed and locked, however, everything will be hunky-dory.\nNaturally, they don't, and Black's Stine must team up with a trio of teenagers -- the handsome new kid (Dylan Minette), the pretty neighbor (Odeya Rush) and the nerdy tagalong (a scene-stealing Ryan Lee) -- when his monstrous menagerie is loosed on their otherwise idyllic town.\nAny shred of real creativity ends there. Rather than working to broaden the books' audience, or trying to craft anything that rises above that series' schlocky reputation, Letterman's \"Goosebumps\" is more concerned with crowbarring in as many references to Stine's books as humanly possible while Black and company sprint through town.\nAside from a cameo from the real Stine near the film's end (he plays drama teacher Mr. Black to Jack Black's wordsmith Mr. Stine), there's hardly a shred of cleverness to be found amid all the predictabilities.\nThe scary thing is, with few other family alternatives currently in theaters -- and with Halloween already in the air -- \"Goosebumps\" stands a real chance of winning the box office this weekend.\nJust don't tell any hysterical school librarians.\n____", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:37:29.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
