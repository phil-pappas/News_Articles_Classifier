That’s all I cared about. I didn’t have any ambitions in high school to do this whatsoever.” \nJeong was felled by the acting virus during his last days of high school. \n“There was this little performance piece, and I was asked to do it and kind of stole scenes in that. I just didn’t know I had a knack for it like that. \n“I just kind of scratched that itch in college. One thing led to another — led to stand-up, led to acting. All the while, I still felt it was a hobby. My goal was to be a physician and to still do this.” \nBut fate kept interrupting his plan. \n“It was one of those things that your passion side project became your full-time job,” Jeong said. \n“Still, there’s a side of me — like, 10 years ago, I was doing stand-up on the side and I was very happy doing that. I was working at an HMO, and my wife’s a doctor; all my good friends are doctors. So I was happy then. I’m much happier now.” \nMost actors can pinpoint the grim times of their ascent to prominence. Jeong, however, experienced a sure and steady climb in show business. \nBut life threw him a challenge far more wrenching than his erratic job. \nIn 2008, his wife, Tran, learned that she had breast cancer; their twin girls were just a year old. \nWith the help of family, she recovered. Tran, who has been cancer-free for seven years, still works in family practice. \nHis wife is the one who encouraged Jeong to give up his job in medicine. \n“It was scary to quit my day job,” he acknowledged. “I wasn’t sure I could make it. I said, ‘ Well, if it doesn’t work out, I could go back in some shape or form.'\" \nWhen he committed to acting, he said, he found much happiness. \n“Entertainment is so fickle,” said Jeong, shaking his head, “and you just don’t know. But at the same time, it’s very clarifying because knowing that no job lasts forever. It’s a lot like life: Just enjoy it while you can.” \nWhich is what Jeong plans to do with Dr. Ken . \n“I want to enjoy every second of it,” he said. “I want this to be as fulfilling as possible — and that’s kind of how one should look at life.” \nJeong craves stability and excitement, he said, and he’s trying to approach the big picture with proper balance. \n“I think you’re doing humanity a disservice if you’re not doing what you love to do,” he said. “ I still keep in contact with patients and still have my license to practice. My wife’s a doctor, and I think the last thing you want is a doctor to take care of you who doesn’t want to do it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T10:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:44:57.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
