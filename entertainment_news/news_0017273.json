Jha | October 08, 2015, 00.43 am It is no secret that Shah Rukh Khan is Aditya Chopra’s lucky charm. Be it Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, Mohabbatein or Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi, all of Adi’s directorial projects have featured SRK and gone on to be major blockbusters.\nThis is the first time that Adi Chopra will direct a film — Befikre — without SRK as the male lead actor. Ranveer Singh will do the honours instead.\nOne of Adi’s most ambitious scripts so far, Befikre was to be directed by another director, but along the way Adi was so taken by the film that he decided to make it himself. In keeping with the Yash Raj tradition, however, Shah Rukh will make a special appearance in the film.\nAn actor very close to the Yash Raj family says, “It’s just that this role required a younger actor.

I believe he will\nmake a guest appearance in Befikre.”\n Aditya Chopra’s lucky charm Also Read Girl protests and forces runaway groom to marry Drug addict stabs 1 to death in Hyderabad Directors felicitate Vetrimaaran Bengaluru: Activist helps police reunite 3-year-old child with mother", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151008/entertainment-bollywood/article/srk-do-cameo-adi’s-befikre", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-08T11:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:17:03.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
