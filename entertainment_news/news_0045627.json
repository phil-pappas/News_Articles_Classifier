Taste and distinction pay off now. Love is also part of the story.\nAries (March 20-April 18) A mere job can morph into a full-scale career this fall. Of course, that means more money but also new perks, not to mention power. We’re talking Applause! Applause! (The Goddess only knows how much you deserve it.) \nTaurus (April 19-May 19) Think creativity as Jupiter and Venus romp and play in your fun house. Books and plays will get written, children will be born (or begun). Additionally, a playful sun brings exciting breakthroughs where least expected.\nGemini (May 20-June 20) Venus, the cosmic party girl, dons a frilly apron to sashay ’round your home center. That mad, man-about-town, Jupiter, also drops by. Think capital G glitz while tweaking your digs with an eye to entertaining. \nCancer (June 21-July 21) Do not ask for whom the bell tolls. Pick up your cell! Jupiter and Venus make for a dynamic duo as they man your personal switchboard. In other news: Be prepared for a sibling saga. (Not necessarily a bad thing.) \n. Leo (July 22-Aug. 22) With those merry pranksters, Jupiter and Venus, in your counting house, you won’t want to deny yourself anything, but be selective. Spend money to make money. The time’s come to make a statement about who and what you are. \nVirgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22) Venus and Jupiter are a fun couple if there ever was one. And isn’t it just too, too marvelous that they’ve designated your sign as Party Central ? Romp and play, Virg, romp and play! You don’t get a bonanza like this every day.\nLibra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22) You think a lot about the one that got away. “If I knew then what I know now” ... that sort of thing. Is love really better the second time around? Only one way to find out. \nScorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21) A friend can morph into something much more this week. Now, is this is a good thing? Love stuff aside, rewards currently come in unexpected ways. Watch pals go to bat for you. Time to establish priorities.\nSagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 20) Take a good long look at the Ram’s starcast because it applies to you as well. You two firecrackers just could take over the world. Jupiter and Venus have turned your office chair into a loveseat. Their dreamy musings spell capital S success for you. \nCapricorn (Dec. 21-Jan. 18) With Venus in the sack with Jupiter anything goes. One couldn’t ask for livelier bedfellows especially now as they rock and roll in your travel zone. Time to holiday with your honey. If not already “taken,” look for a soul mate.\nAquarius (Jan. 19-Feb. 17) Intimacy issues run silent, run deep for you Aquarians. You may say the trip’s more interesting than the destination, but do you really believe it? All this while Jupiter and Venus rally round your counting house. \nPisces (Feb. 18-March 19) Jupiter (the godfather) and Venus (that Cosmopolitan girl) slip into your relationship house to search for new ways to surprise and please partners. Meanwhile the sun continues to favor contracts. How’s that for inspiration? \nMinerva’s mailbag\nQ: My birth date is Sept. 24, 1966. After uprooting several times over the last dozen years, we can’t seem to find our spot to land. (My husband’s birthday is May 10, 1974.) \nA: The year ahead looks promising. Work, training and good deeds will all pay off — possibly in unexpected ways. But your next birthday — the big 5-oh! — is huge. Libras everywhere will have cause to celebrate, but methinks it will be extra specially good for you. \nTo ask Minerva a question, go to www.askminerva.com or write to Minerva, Sunday Datebook, San Francisco Chronicle , 901 Mission St., San Francisco, CA 94103.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:23:13.554+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
