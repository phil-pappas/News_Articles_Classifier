Despite the fact that this season's Top Model has found arguably its most beautiful model in a while â€” Nyle DiMarco, come on down â€” and just recently aired an episode featuring a perfectly nonsensical music video promoting Tyra's new line of beauty products, it will apparently be the long-running reality show's last cycle. In a tweet this afternoon, Tyra said she's thinking it over, but \"truly [believes] it's time\" to end things. She has no more fucks photos left to give:\n TYRA MAIL!\nThinking #ANTM22 should be our last cycle. I truly believe it's time. May your pics be forever fierce. Keep on Smizing!\nðŸ’›Tyra\nâ€” Tyra Banks (@tyrabanks) October 14, 2015\nUrgh , this is just the worst. I'm crying so hard right now it's like that challenge in cycle 6 where Tyra made the models cry except they used tear sticks to induce their emotion and that was cheating, really; my sadness is for real. Tyra, we were all rooting for you... to make this show last forever.\nReconsider, please!\nFollow Alex on Twitter . â€‹", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/ANTM22?src=hash", "http://twitter.com/maybealexislost", "http://www.cwtv.com/shows/americas-next-top-model/cycle-22-model-interview--nyle/?play=0ca51612-e0b6-47ab-b76b-5f6c850f8ae5", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbR5eHC3haM", "https://twitter.com/tyrabanks/status/654375454879563776"], "published": "2015-10-14T23:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:52:02.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
