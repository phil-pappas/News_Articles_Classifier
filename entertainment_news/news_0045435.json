Remarkable wine. Challenging wine. Expensive wine.\nIndeed, \"Wine\" would have been a more appropriate title (though an infinitely more boring one) for what executive chef Dave Beran and his team have wrought. Terroir, after all, is the word the French use to describe a wine's sense of place, an expression of soil, climate and style that can be discerned in a glass.\nIt's a particularly amusing theme for this restaurant, because Next is a dining room that, by design, offers no sense of place whatsoever. The restaurant is windowless, the moodily neutral interior flexible by necessity, able to serve as a Parisian bistro for a few months and shift seamlessly into a ringside table for the Bocuse d'Or competition down the line.\nIn the course of the Terroir evening, one will taste about 15 wines, each with its own fascinating story, alongside novel food matches. Sometimes the food will echo the region whence the wine originates (which one might expect, which is probably why Beran only does so once or twice); other times the food with play off a specific quality or flavor.\nSome pairings will make perfect sense, others will violate long-held wine truisms, and one or two will sound like the product of some wine-food random generator (Canary Islands gual with coriander-crusted hamachi and fermented gooseberries, I'm looking at you.)\nIn the course of the Terroir evening at Next restaurant, you will taste about 15 wines, each with its own fascinating story, alongside novel food matches.\nPart of the delight of Next has always been the way in which the team defies expectations, challenges assumptions and zigs when you anticipate zag. The other part is the storytelling, the inside-scoop factoids that make Next's chosen cuisines and dishes spring to life. And because wine arguably brings more assumptions to the table than any other single aspect of fine dining, and because the who, what, when and where of wine are inextricable parts of its appeal, Terroir plays directly into Next's strengths.\nOur meal started, not with the aforementioned Krug champagne (too obvious, Beran said), but with three fine Burgundies — two red, one white — served with a quintet of snacks placed about the table. Among the bites: gravity-defying prosciutto chips dabbed with whipped honey and grape powder; creme fraiche-stuffed rye croquette topped with char roe (a play on the lox/toast/cream cheese idea); caramelized-onion cones filled with chicken heart and powdered chicken skin; and a grilled-cheese-inspired Parmesan crostini.\nLeading a wine dinner with rich reds already puts most patrons in uncharted territory, and that's precisely the point.\nThe second course is a three-pronged contemplation of chenin blanc, one each from France, South Africa and California. Served in stemless glasses arranged along a wine-barrel stave, it looks every bit like a 101-level wine flight, the wines' various levels of fruit and minerality pitted against sturgeon, charred scallions and various iterations of peanuts (boiled, chopped and raw-peanut butter) with red currants, a riff on peanut butter and jelly.\nHaving surprised us by leading off with red wine, Next's wine team (led by Jordan Sipperley, he of the Krug Life/Thug Life joke and the evening's principal storyteller) pulls out another surprise by pouring schioppettino, a rustic red from Fruili that Sipperley calls his favorite wine and likens to \"hearing a band that you love, but that hasn't caught on yet.\"\nTo match the wine, Beran took two dishes from the same region — a barley porridge and dumpling broth — and combined them, creating a double-barley consomme (with irresistible toasted, malted and burnt notes) containing tiny arugula gougeres.\nNow that was a terroir dish. But not the best one. The distinction goes to a later course, starring a Santa Cruz mountains cabernet sauvignon, in which heated stones turn artichoke and eucalyptus leaves into an aromatic hike through the Northern California woods. Centered in the dish, an egg cup holds artichoke puree, sauteed snails, miniature dices of fried basil baguette and snail caviar; the \"if it grows together, it goes together\" dictum has never been so persuasive.\nTo evoke the winds of the Rhone Valley, one dish arrived under a cloche containing rosemary-scented smoke. Another composition includes caviar, buttered-popcorn soup (no, really), and potato and apple chips in an onion-y creme fraiche (this will ruin you forever for potluck chip-and-dip), all in nested bowls. And pear and blue cheese, surely one of the greatest pairings in the world, commingle as pear cider within a cheese-infused white-chocolate shell, presented on a forest-floor bed of moss over dry ice (the white smoke representing the coastal layer).\nThere are surprises throughout, and it would be a shame to reveal them here. Suffice it to say you will rethink what you thought you knew about riesling. You'll wonder what's taking the Champagne so long to arrive. (You'll know you're finally getting it when the empty flute is set in front of you, but what is that other wine glass for?) And you'll finish the meal with an utterly predictable wine that will curl your toes regardless.\nThis is one of Next's most fascinating menus ever, and it's also one of the most expensive. A single ticket will run about $450, depending on the day and time. But you will taste some remarkable wines.\nThe Terroir menu runs through Dec. 31 (I bet that New Year's Eve seating will be fun); the relatively short duration of the menu is why this review (as has been the case with all my Next reviews) is based on a single visit. And because of my many appearances at Next in the past five years, my efforts at anonymity are fruitless here.\nNext\n953 W.
