By Shaheen Parkar | Posted 25 minutes ago \nRanveer Singh is believed to have had reservations about being cast opposite a one-film actress \nEver since Aditya Chopra announced his directorial venture, 'Befikre', starring Ranveer Singh and Vaani Kapoor, there has been continuous buzz about the project. We hear the actor was excited about being part of Chopra's film, he was a tad reluctant about the pairing. \nRanveer Singh \n\"Knowing Ranveer's sentiments towards his guide and mentor, Aditya Chopra, he might not have thought it appropriate to broach the topic with him,\" says a source. \n'Befikre' will be the second Hindi film for Vaani, two years after she made her Bollywood debut opposite Sushant Singh Rajput in 'Shuddh Desi Romance' (2013). Since there was a great deal of speculation over the female lead and names leading actress were tossed around, Ranveer was apparently optimistic about a pataka pairing. \n\"But when the announcement came, Ranveer was not too sure. However, since he trusts Aditya's judgment, he chose to go along with his decision,\" the source adds. \nRanveer Singh remained unavailable for comment.
