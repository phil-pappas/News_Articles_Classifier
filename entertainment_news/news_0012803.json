It is likely that the high temperature, in the middle 70s, will not be exceeded during the remainder of this season. Cooler and drier air arrives Wednesday night, but daytime readings Thursday and Friday will still be about five degrees above normal. Then another surge of mild air will arrive briefly Saturday, pushing temperatures into the lower 70s. Showers, possibly some thunderstorms, accompany the mild air before another push of cooler air Saturday night.\nChicago has experienced very little rain in October, but showers Tuesday night and Wednesday and again Friday night and Saturday may help to reduce the deficit that amounts to about two inches across the metropolitan area.\nCopyright Â© 2015, Chicago Tribune Weather", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5627198e/turbine/ct-wea-1021-summary-20151020"], "published": "2015-10-21T04:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:01:15.619+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
