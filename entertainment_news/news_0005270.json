The Cubs have hit .158 and scored five runs in three games off Mets pitching. If they can pull this out, Epstein may be awarded a Nobel Prize for curse-breaking.\n\"It's not going to be easy,\" manager Joe Maddon said. \"But it can be done.\"\nSaid Mets manager Terry Collins: \"Being up 3-0, we're very, very fortunate, because the Cubs have played great.\"\nGame 3 was an intense affair for most of the night, until the Mets burst through in a most October-like way.\nTrevor Cahill struck out Mets outfielder Michael Conforto on a wild pitch curveball to seemingly end the sixth inning. But Yoenis Cespedes, who had stolen third base, scored easily as the ball skirted past Miguel Montero and skidded toward the brick wall behind home plate.\n\"It was not an easy play, but a play a catcher could make, and (Montero) knows that,\" Maddon said.\nCespedes' lead on his steal of third was so big he couldn't have been caught with a bazooka.\n\"I saw him do that, and at that point it was 0-2, so I wasn't too worried about it,\" Cahill said. \"I was like, I can hopefully put this guy away by a strikeout or a weak ground ball, and you know, it worked out.\"\nIt worked out with the strikeout, but then it didn't work out when Cespedes scored the go-ahead run on the wild pitch.\n\"I've thrown to him for three years and he blocks like 99 out of 100,\" Cahill said. \"Unfortunately it didn't work out today. … It kind of skipped right and went to the one place he wasn't blocking.\"\nThe Cubs were fortunate that Conforto didn't score on Wilmer Flores' line shot to right that Jorge Soler dived for and missed. Instead of bouncing back off the wall onto the warning track, the ball was swallowed by the ivy, sending Conforto back to third on a ground-rule double.\nCollins argued that the runner should have scored, but the ground rules did not allow it.\nBut the relief was only temporary. The Mets added two runs in the seventh after Kris Bryant couldn't throw out Daniel Murphy on a slow roller and Kyle Schwarber couldn't handle a hard liner off Cespedes' bat, adding up to a three-run lead. The inning sapped the energy from a crowd of 42,231 that already had reached its screech limit.\nGame 3 may have been a headache, but it never was a bore. The top of the first inning gave Cubs fans reason to shout one moment and chew on their fingernails the next.\nA Javier Baez error on the shift started it off. Chew. Montero threw Curtis Granderson out trying to steal second. Shout. David Wright singled off Kyle Hendricks. Chew. Murphy struck out on three pitches. Shout. Cespedes doubled home Wright to give the Mets a first-inning lead for the third straight game. Chew, chew. Schwarber overran a Lucas Duda fly but reached back to catch it anyway. Chew, chew, shout.\nIt was a crazy, up-and-down pace that couldn't possibly keep up.\nBut, of course, it did.\nWhen Schwarber cranked an opposite-field home run into the left field bleachers on a 96 mph Jacob deGrom fastball on a 3-2 pitch, the ballpark reacted like an out-of-control tilt-a-whirl.\nThen came the Murphy moment du jour. Cubs starters still haven't figured out a way to contain the Mets' version of Heisenberg from \"Breaking Bad.\" Murphy started out as a mild-mannered second baseman two weeks ago, only to evolve into the baddest character October has given us in years.\nMurphy's shot off Hendricks in the third, his sixth of the postseason and third against the Cubs, tied a postseason record for consecutive games (five) with a home run. Cespedes followed with a shot to deep center that Dexter Fowler leaped for at the wall, disturbing some of the purple and red ivy as well as those who felt Hendricks' already had reached his expiration date.\nSoler, finally thawed out from his weekend in the Big Apple, blasted another home run in the fourth to tie the game, and Maddon pinch-hit for Hendricks two batters later to prevent any more damage to the ivy.\nMaddon now will have to empty his bag of tricks for the Cubs to have a shot at pulling off a miracle. Before Game 3 the Cubs were greeted with the theme from \"Rocky\" during pregame player introductions.\nThe Mets had no music for their intros, though the theme from \"Jaws\" would have been appropriate.\npsullivan@tribpub.com\nTwitter @PWSullivan\nPrivacy Policy Copyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Major League Baseball Baseball Chicago Cubs New York Mets Daniel Murphy Joe Maddon National League Championship Series", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56272145/turbine/ct-sullivan-cubs-spt-1021-20151020"], "published": "2015-10-21T08:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:27:21.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
