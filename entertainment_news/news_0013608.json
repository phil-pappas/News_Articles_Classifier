The 2015 winner of the Avery Fisher Career Grant, Brown has been described by the New York Times as a “young piano visionary” and “one of the leading figures in the current renaissance of performer-composers.” “Michael Brown, one of America’s finest rising musical talents, became a treasured musical friend in his first visit last year,” said David Commanday, artistic director and conductor of the HFO. “I look forward to his return performance with highest expectations and great pleasure!” When Brown performed with the HFO last fall, he was joined by violinist Elena Urioste and cellist Nicholas Canellakis. The trio performed Beethoven’s Triple Concerto. The Oct. 24 concert will feature three works by Beethoven, the Coriolan Overture, op. 62, Piano Concerto No. 3 in C minor, op. 37, and Symphony No. 7 in A Major, op. 92. “Our cycle of the Beethoven symphonies has brought us to the Seventh, an amazing and invigorating dance of power, energy, and joy,” said Commanday. “The Coriolan Overture is a masterpiece of dramatic tragedy, and the C Minor Concerto balances musical logic, invention, and beauty with pianistic and orchestral virtuosity.” Tickets are $35 for adults, $8 for students, and are available online at www.heartlandfestivalorchestra.org and at the Five Points Washington Box office, 360 N. Wilmor Road, Washington. A vendor service fee of $4 per ticket is assessed for tickets purchased in both locations. A limited number of tickets are available without the service fee for patrons buying in person with cash or check at Kidder Music, 7728 N Crestline Dr. Bus rides to the concert can be reserved by calling 339-3943.
