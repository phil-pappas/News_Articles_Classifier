The play is an imaginary conversation between Anne Frank, who died in a Nazi concentration camp, and Emmett Till, who was killed by racists in Mississippi in 1955. \nThe play will be performed for some 1,100 recruits in Queens over two performances on Thursday, part of a push by the department to address community mistrust. \nSays the playwright: \"If the play can reach one man or woman with a badge and a gun, I'm happy.\" \nThink your friends should see this?

The cityâ€™s Police Academy has added the one-act play â€œAnne & Emmettâ€ by Janet Langhart Cohen to its recruit training this fall. The play is an imaginary conversation between Anne Frank, who died in a Nazi concentration camp, and Emmett Till, who was killed by a racist mob in Mississippi in 1955. The play will be performed for some 1,100 recruits at their academy in Queens over two performances on Thursday, part of a push by the department to prepare future police officers to overcome community mistrust and their own bias.
