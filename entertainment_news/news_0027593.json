But the rash of protests by the filmmakers and literati that followed this has brought the film the spotlight it deserves for addressing a subject that, under the light of rising communal violence in the country , has become more relevant than ever before.\n\"A lot of people are watching it. Institutions and organizations across the country are organizing screenings; I even have people writing in to say that they are holding screenings at their homes. The movie is being viralled in a big way . And with incidents like Dadri becoming common, I think it needs to be seen,\" says Sawhney , who was in Bengaluru recently to participate in a screening held by the India Foundation for the Arts.\nDocumenting the Muzaffarnagar riots of 2013, Sawhney's film tackles a host of factors that led to the violent clashes -from caste-identity politics to Hindutva's rising supremacy to even a rising class divide. \"In 2010, When I was making Izzatnagari Ki Asabhya Betiyaan about honour killings in Haryana, I had to visit Muzaffarnagar and there was a palpable feeling in the air about rising communal strife. What became evident was that there was an anti-Dalit, anti-Muslim feeling building up among the Jats, who were looking to create a political identity for themselves,\" says Sawhney . \"Things played out on a larger scale eventually, with the Jats merging their interests with BJP but, frankly , when news of the massacre broke out, I wasn't sure I'd make a documentary film. The initial idea was to make a 20-minute short film and put it online.\"\nIt turned out to be 136-minute stark tale of how multiple factors like religion, economics, caste and community played their part in creating one of the most violent riots the nation has witnessed; an event that Sawhney chooses to de scribe as an \"ideological turning point for independent India.\" One of the stark moments in the film is a young Muslim man talking about how Hindu friends he grew up playing Holi with today strut around brandishing tridents and threatening to attack Muslims.\nThe film was an unscripted project, says Sawhney, \"Generally , when you are working on a documentary film, you do a lot of research and have some idea of what you are making but here, the events were unfolding as we went along and so, frankly, there was no clarity on what the final output was going to be.\"\nOne of the unexpected challenges of filming the riots was the fact that Sawhney's camera-person was a Muslim man. \"In some places, there was such a strong anti-Muslim feeling that we had to change his name,\" says Sawhney bluntly.\nFEEL PROUD TO CALL MYSELF AN FTII ALUMNUS As a 2006 alumnus of FTII, Sawhney has taken a strong stand in the ongoing FTII student strike against the selection of Gajendra Chauhan as the institute's chairman. He says, \"I am proud of the FTII students. It is amazing how they have held out despite the shameless crackdown by the authorities, the arrest, and attempts to malign them. I view this strike as one not against the institute, but against the Government of India, which by the way, has not reacted favourably at all.They have tried to stifle the voices of the students but the fact that they have held on strongly makes me proud to call myself an FTII alumnus.\"\nFor latest Bollywood updates, follow us on Twitter >>> @TOIEntertain\nFor the latest in Bollywood news, like us on Facebook >>> TOIEntertain\nFor more interesting Bollywood news and pictures, follow us on Pinterest>>> timesofindia\nFor latest Bollywood updates, follow us on G+ >>> The Times of India Entertainment", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TOIEntertain", "https://www.pinterest.com/timesofindia/", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107628521107103264647/+TOIEntertainment/posts", "https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T19:33:58.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
