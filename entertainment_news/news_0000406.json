It is the association's fifth consecutive annual deficit.\nCSO, musicians ratify new three-year contract John von Rhein Following one of the longest and hardest-fought series of collective bargaining sessions in recent Chicago Symphony Orchestra history, the musicians finally have a new labor contract.\nThe members of the CSO and the board of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra Association voted in separate meetings Tuesday...\nFollowing one of the longest and hardest-fought series of collective bargaining sessions in recent Chicago Symphony Orchestra history, the musicians finally have a new labor contract.\nThe members of the CSO and the board of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra Association voted in separate meetings Tuesday...\n(John von Rhein) Also, overall contributed revenue dropped to $36 million from $57 million, while general operating support declined to $27 million from $30.2 million.\nThe results were contained in the fiscal 2015 report released at the association's annual meeting Thursday afternoon at Symphony Center.\nOutgoing board Chairman Jay Henderson presented the financial statistics and CSOA President Jeff Alexander cited artistic highlights from the year leading up to the orchestra's present 125th anniversary season.\nHenderson was honored for his dozen years of board service, the final three as chairman. Under his tenure, the association and orchestra musicians ratified a new, three-year contract Sept. 29. The orchestra and Riccardo Muti will depart next week on a brief tour to cities in Missouri, Michigan and North Carolina.\nThe meeting included the election of new officers, including as Henderson's successor Helen Zell, one of the CSO's major benefactors, along with her husband, Sam Zell. A $17 million gift from the Zell Family Foundation provided support in perpetuity for the position of music director last year, at which point Muti assumed the title of Zell Music Director.\nThe CSOA also extended the contract of cellist Yo-Yo Ma another two years as the orchestra's Judson and Joyce Green creative consultant, through the 2016-17 season.\nEndowment gifts last year totaled $7 million, and the value of endowment investments totaled $282 million. Total assets for the year stood at $520 million, net assets at $304 million. More than 13,000 individuals supported the CSO through philanthropic gifts. Of those individuals, 11,047 gave to the annual fund, continuing a four-year trend of increasing participation.\nThe CSO still commands a subscription renewal rate of 89 percent, one of the highest for a major U.S. orchestra. Nearly 369,000 tickets were sold for 233 ticketed concerts last year, excluding Ravinia and tour concerts outside the Chicago area. Average paid capacity was up, to 82 percent from 79 percent.\nSome $9 million in additional revenue was earned from touring fees, merchandise sales, space rentals, royalties, recording fees and miscellaneous activities, the association reported.\nJohn von Rhein is a Tribune critic.\njvonrhein@tribpub.com\nTwitter @jvonrhein\n Chicago Symphony Orchestra Riccardo Muti Entertainment", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562965c7/turbine/ct-cso-fiscal-2015-ent-1023-20151022", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560a8915/turbine/ct-cso-strike-settlement-20150929"], "published": "2015-10-23T01:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:03:40.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
