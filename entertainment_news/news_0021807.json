In solidarity, I will be wearing my panties at half-mast... and have maybe one more for the road. I would be totally willing just to take it all off one more time, just to say I'll be in the last one.\" \nJenny is also adamant Playboy founder Hugh Hefner did not create a lewd publication, adding, \"He worked really hard on trying to find the girl next door. They weren't the girls that had just got off Monday nights on the poles... Even when I went to Playboy, they went through a huge slew of questions making sure I never did anything like that... Then when I did my test shoot there I had one uni-brow and a giant bush to my knees, and they were like, 'You're in! You're a girl next door!' They really capture that innocence in the women... there was nothing ever skanky about the photos, I never felt like I was posing in a way that would make my mum disown me.\" Copyright WENN.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:13:08.387+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
