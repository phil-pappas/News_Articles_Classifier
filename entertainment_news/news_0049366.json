Source: Supplied \nTHE drama of Ravel and triumph of Tchaikovsky; the Queensland Symphony Orchestra is bringing a vibrant repertoire to Cairns Civic Theatre next week. \nConductor Jessica Cottis began her career as an organist and piano player, and performed in Paris and London, but an injury set her on course for being a conductor, a role she had her heart set on as a child. \n“I never knew though when I was a girl it was possible for a woman to be a conductor,” Cottis says. “You have to be able to do a lot of things; you have to be a polymath and not just know your music, but the socio economics, the history, the art literature. All of these you need to have the artistic vision.” \nKnowledge of the music, of course, is tantamount and Cottis knows every note each player in the orchestra plays in order to be able to create the sound she wants for the orchestra as a whole. \n“You have to have good ears, really excellent ears; it is possible for all really top conductors, to hear every line, and I can almost hear something before it goes wrong.” \nCottis is looking forward to taking the helm for Bolero, the French composer’s music she became entranced with in 1984 when UK ice skating champions Torvill and Dean performed to it, scooping gold medals at the Winter Olympics. \n“I love the incredible progress of the music and how it has a life of its own,” Cottis says. \n“It starts with a snare drum that begins imperceptibly and builds throughout, with a magnificent slow steering until it reaches a controlled crescendo.” \n“There are 326 bars with no key change and then finally all that pent up energy bursts forward like fireworks.” \nAnother highlight of the QSO’s visit is the performance of young Russian pianist Marina Yakhlakova, of Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto No.1 . \nLocal musician and now Queensland Symphony Orchestra’s principal bassoonist David Mitchell also returns to Cairns to perform in the concert. \nCHECK Bolero and Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto No. 1 performed by Queensland Symphony Orchestra at Cairns Civic Theatre, October 12 and 13 at 7.30pm and 10am, book at ticketlink.com.au or 1300 855 835.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:59:50.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
