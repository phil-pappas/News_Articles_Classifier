Two-thirds of the 298 people who died were Dutch.\nThe 15-month probe did not explicitly say who had fired the missile, but it identified an area of 320km 2 from where it said the launch must have taken place. All of the land was in the hands of pro-Russian separatists fighting Ukrainian forces at the time of the disaster, according to daily maps of fighting released by the Ukrainian National Security Council.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T22:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:18:26.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
