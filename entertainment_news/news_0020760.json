Politics and social class were, after all, two of the favorite targets of early burlesque theater. But even if today's acts have become more risque, they still share burlesque's main credo: it's all in the build-up. \nWhile the line between true burlesque and striptease often is thinner than a G-string, you can't have a burlesque show without at least one stripper act. But there is a difference. \n\"True burlesque is all about the mind,\" Lemley says. \"It's all about the tease, not about getting naked. Whether you're peeling off a layer of clothing or titillating with feathers or singing a provocative song, it's about the tease, what shows and also what doesn't show. We really wanted to create a show that shows how profound burlesque was on American culture.\" \nLemley, a Rita Hayworth-like knockout, has been in show business since age 5. She grew up in Columbus, Ind., attended the Interlochen Arts Academy, and studied theater and vocal performance at New York University. So what's a nice girl from the Midwest, who even studied opera at the Conservatoire National in Paris, doing in the world of feather boas and burlesque boudoir? \"I actually started singing opera, then just fell in love with jazz, the American Songbook, pop music and all that,\" Lemley says. \nRita Hayworth, in fact, was part of the inspiration for \"Burlesque to Broadway.\"\"She was so provocative in singing 'Put the Blame on Mame' from the movie 'Gilda,' but all she did was take off one glove. She was also famous for the 'Zip' strip routine in 'Pal Joey,'\" says Lemley, who also does an entire Rita Hayworth show. \n\"The real idea behind the show is a celebration of the iconic women who went from burlesque halls to the Broadway stage and beyond,\" Lemley says. \"They really shape-shifted culture as we know it today, whether it's the costumes, body humor or the double entendre. Women like Mae West, Fanny Brice and Sally Rand with her feather fans — can you even imagine any kind of show without feathers?\" \n\"Burlesque to Broadway\" combines the glam of Broadway with the humor so important to burlesque. \"There's lots of humor in the show, but instead of the baggy-pants comics we do a lot of crossovers with sexy women and gorgeous costumes,\" Lemley says. \"We do all the Burns and Allen jokes. What's really great is that Gracie Allen actually performed here. The Lehigh Valley was such a huge community for burlesque. It's an honor for us to celebrate that, and hopefully bring a little of that magic back to the Lyric Theater.\" \nThe Lyric was nearly as famous for hosting Broadway stars and radio and television personalities as it was for its burlesque acts. Some of the greatest names in the industry appeared here, including Carol Channing, Sarah Bernhardt, John Barrymore, Bing Crosby, Benny Goodman and the Marx Brothers. \"Burlesque to Broadway\" shows how much stars like these owe to burlesque, so often unfairly cast in the role of theater's unsavory stepsister. \n\"We show how burlesque evolved, from the Betty Boops and sexy maids of the 1920s to tunes by Cole Porter and Irving Berlin. From very show-girly numbers like 'Terrific Rainbow' from 'Pal Joey,' we evolve into the 1960s, '70s, and '80s with songs like 'She's a Lady' and more contemporary acts, like Cher and Bette Midler,\" Lemley says. The show not only revels in down-and-dirty numbers such as Johnny Lee Hooker's immortal \"Boom Boom,\" but also in quieter messages of female empowerment, such as Lesley Gore's \"You Don't Own Me.\" \n\"Our goal is to have each number represent an aspect of being a woman, and what's sexy and feminine, whether it's the French maid or an empowered woman like Mae West, who's seen it all and done it all,\" Lemley says. \nOne gal who's seen it all and done it all — mostly — is Penny Starr, a burlesque dancer now in the 58th year of her career. Starr makes it clear she is not, and has never been, a stripper. \"I'm not a stripper, honey, I'm an exotic dancer. I'm the one that teases you, OK? I don't take it all off,\" says Starr from her home in Palm Bay, Fla. \nWith her high heels, breakaway ball gowns and feathered boas, it's hard to believe Starr is 82. She still appears in Vegas clubs once a year. \"I'm not afraid to get up among the young ones. I can do just as good — I've been in it for years, you know,\" she says. \nFor \"Burlesque to Broadway,\" Starr will be dancing to her signature number, the jazz standard \"Harlem Nocturne.\"\"I know I'll be dancing to a live band, but for now I've got to practice with CDs. I used to just give my music to the orchestra, and they would play it and hit me just at the right places in the routine. If the crowd liked it, the band would just keep going,\" she says. \"I can't do that with the CD — it's the worst thing in the world for me.\" \nIn honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, Starr will be wearing all pink, a theme that will be echoed by the pink ribbon charm bracelets the Allentown Symphony Association will sell in the lobby. A portion of the bracelet and ticket proceeds will benefit Lehigh Valley Health Network's Pink Ribbon Fund. \nStarr, born Janet Gaynor Colby, is a 1951 Allentown High School grad who, unlike Lemley, put off her ambition to be onstage by getting married young and having kids. While Lemley went off to Paris to study opera, in 1957 Starr ran away from home to join a circus that was passing through town. Her first dancing partner was Lucy the elephant. \n\"Every night Lucy would put her foot down on me, and I thought if she ever got mad at me, I'm done,\" Starr says. \"We were on good terms, but I still wanted to get rid of that elephant. One winter, the circus went to Florida, and I signed up as a dancer in a girl show at a club called Guys and Dolls in Tampa. Back then I had no idea what a girl show was, so I asked the manager. 'Well, honey, if you want to dance, you can dance,' he told me. It was there that I really learned burlesque.\" \nIt was soon after that when Janet Gaynor Colby took the name Penny Starr, a name suggested by her mother, who loved the movies \"Pennies from Heaven\" and \"A Star is Born.\" In her heyday, Starr worked clubs around the Northeast, including the Lyric Theater and big-name venues such as the Cotton Club and the Black Orchid. In 1963 she was named Atlantic City's Miss Bump-and-Grind, and is a member of the Miss Exotic World Hall of Fame in Las Vegas. \nIn keeping with its burlesque heritage, the \"Burlesque to Broadway\" set list features some classic stripper numbers. \"Hey Big Spender\" and \"Let me Entertain You\" are two biggies, but most famous of all is probably David Rose's \"The Stripper,\" the one most people think about when they think strip. \"We even put lyrics to it,\" Lemley says. \"You can't do a show like this and not do that one.\" \nA special treat will be Lemley's own version of a Gypsy Rose Lee strip act. \"I think the audience will really have fun with that one,\" says Lemley. And don't worry, she'll be completely covered. \nAfter all, it was Gypsy Rose Lee who so famously said, \"I wasn't naked — I was completely covered by a blue spotlight.\" \nSteve Siegel is a freelance writer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:52:01.882+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
