Parks and Recreation champion Nick Offerman (who has swapped his mighty moustache for an alarming chin beard) plays lawyer Karl Weathers and Australia’s own Angus Sampson bobs up as local ne’er-do-well Bear Gerhardt. Like True Detective 2 (minus Vince Vaughn strangling the dialogue), series two of Fargo stands alone, meaning you don’t have to have seen the first series to get the hang of it. Set in 1979, the series kicks off with a triple murder at the waffle hut in snow-filled Luverne, Minnesota, and soon opens up into the investigation of a major Mob syndicate. \nThe Ex-PM, ABC, 9.05pm \nAdvertisement This is vintage Shaun Micallef: jokes that veer between the sublime and the ridiculous pepper every sentence, so no opportunity is lost for a gag. Micallef is former prime minister Andrew Dugdale. It’s not clear where he sits in the latest prime ministerial rankings, although my guess is Rudd/Gillard/Rudd/Abbott/Dugdale. He is friends with George W. Bush and it’s this name dropping that opens up the best joke of the night as Dugdale learns of a twin (model) plane attack on his home while he listens to his grandson Stefan read during Grandparents Day at his alma mater, Ayn Rand Primary School.  \nExtreme Russia with Reggie Yates, ABC2, 9.30pm  \nFor many young Russians, Vladimir Putin is so hot right now he is also a fashion statement: his image emblazoned across T-shirts, dresses and jumpers. It appears reasonably harmless, but it’s just the tip of the far right nationalistic iceberg as BBC radio host and TV presenter Reggie Yates discovers in the first episode of this series that dives into \"extreme Russia\". Putin love is just a gateway drug into the far right, where young Russians use social media to post call-to-arms videos and anti-immigration messages. It’s pretty confronting to watch, so I can only imagine what it must have felt like for Yates, as he is used by the extremists for their own propaganda videos.\nLouise Rugendyke", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T01:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T05:20:30.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
