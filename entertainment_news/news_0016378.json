Morgan's opening monologue for the show he hosted turned into a \"30 Rock\" reunion, bringing his former co-stars Tina Fey\n, Alec Baldwin\n, Jane Krakowski\nand Jack McBrayer\nback for a spoof of the NBC sitcom, which ended in 2013. The parody episode \"predicted\" Morgan's car accident, which left him with severe injuries and killed his friend and fellow comedian James \"Jimmy Mack\" McNair. \"I just want to say one last thing, Tracy, from the heart and this part is no joke,\" Fey said, stopping the bit for a serious note. \"We're so happy that you're okay and we're happier that you're ready to make people laugh again.\"\nAfter the sketch, the \"30 Rock\" alums joined Morgan on stage to help him ring in the \"SNL\" episode. During the monologue, Morgan also took an emotional second to thank \"SNL\" chief Lorne Michaels\n, who Morgan called his Obi-Wan Kenobi. The comedian said he called Michaels after his accident and told him, \"I said, 'Lorne, when I get back on my feet, I want to come home,' and here I am.\"\nÂ© 2015 Variety Media, LLC, a subsidiary of Penske Business Media; Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC", "external_links": ["http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=7&c2=6035310&c3=10000&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:40:03.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
