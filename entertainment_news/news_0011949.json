Early Learning Coalition of Southwest Florida Five-Star Rating Members Increase getpushing 4:38 PM, Oct 16, 2015 \nThe Early Learning Coalition of Southwest Florida (ELC) is proud to announce a record number of certified childcare centers have received a top five-star rating from the Southwest Florida Stars program. Receiving a five-star rating from the Southwest Florida Stars is part of the ELC’s Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS) initiative that has been implemented within Collier, Glades, Hendry, and Lee counties. In its second year, the program has already granted nine centers a five-star rating. \nSouthwest Florida Stars is a voluntary system that encourages excellence in early learning programs. Childcare facilities that participate are devoted to creating optimal learning conditions for children. The program rates childcare centers and family childcare homes through site visits and off-site data collection. Using feedback provided by the ELC, centers work on improving the quality of their programs and then are awarded a rating, anywhere from one to five stars. The rating helps parents decide which program best serves their children. \nChildcare programs participating in Southwest Florida Stars are evaluated on health, safety, staff qualifications, learning environment and family and community relationships. Voluntary participation makes programs eligible for training or financial incentives from the ELC, such as material grants and teacher scholarships, which reward and encourage quality improvements. ELC staff also offers ongoing support and technical assistance. \nThe Early Learning Coalition of Southwest Florida exists to enhance the quality of children’s lives by providing families, early childhood educators, caregivers and community partners in Collier, Glades, Hendry and Lee Counties, with opportunities to positively impact the future.
