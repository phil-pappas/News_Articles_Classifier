Her dog, Paco, stayed by the scene of the accident until he was picked up by family members. On Friday morning, the truck-driver was pulling out of a gas station when he allegedly hit Black and dragged her 30 feet, officials added.\nOfficials believe the driver may not have known he hit someone.\n“I don’t see how someone could hit her here and drag her all the way out to Beaver Street and not have known it,” the woman’s father, G.C. Bostick, told the station through tears.\nFamily members told the station Black, Paco and another dog —Sambo, who was not involved in the accident — were inseparable.\nWFOX 30 Paco stayed put for hours after Black’s death, and is ‘not too happy’ according to the victim’s mother, who is familiar with her daughter’s dogs. “(Paco)is not too happy, and Sammy is not either, because she's not there with them right now,” the victim’s mother, Pat Johnson, told the station.\n“They are used to me and they're going to be really sad,” she said.\nJohnson is now asking for the public’s help in figuring out the tragic incident that took her daughter’s life.\n“I wish somebody would call and tell what they’ve seen, what happened and why it happened,” said Johnson. “I would like that very much.”\nKTLA5 A truck-driver was pulling out of a gas station when he allegedly hit Black and dragged her 30 feet on Friday, officials added. Johnson remembered her daughter as a big-hearted woman who deeply loved her two pets.\nThe two women were spending more time together as Black was dedicated to getting closer to her mother in her older years.\n“I loved Kelly to my heart ... She wanted to be close to me because I'm getting old,” Johnson told the station.\n“She was a loving good person and she loved everybody,” she added.\nDeputies are still looking for the truck driver, officials said.", "external_links": ["http://c.brightcove.com/services/viewer/federated_f9?isVid=1", "http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=9,0,47,0", "http://www.actionnewsjax.com/news/news/local/family-asking-witnesses-who-saw-woman-hit-dragged-/nn8Yj/", "http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T23:56:18.939+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
