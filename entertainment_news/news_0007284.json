Many lead lives with little movement, sunshine or human touch, spent staring into a computer screen, under fluorescent lights. Chronically sleep-deprived and eating poorly, they feel terrible. Women shuttling between work (where they earn less than men) and home, straddling child care and aging parents, are stretched to their limit. They escape by drinking, texting, shopping or eating. My patients want pills to make them feel better but, honestly, I’m afraid it's to make them feel less.\nMany psychiatric patients are truly sick and need medication. It is my job to understand the risks and benefits of these meds, and I've seen them do a lot of good for people in real pain. But there is a big push to lower the standards, especially for women, for being sick and needing prescription drugs.\nThe pharmaceutical industry spends billions in advertising and billions more paying researchers and prescribers directly. Women are inundated with messages that it's pathological to feel sad or scared, with a barrage of ads that advance the question from, “Should I take an antidepressant?” to “Which one?”\nRecently my psychiatric journals have been full of glossy ads promoting a new diagnosis, “binge eating disorder.” A picture of a sad, lonely woman surrounded by junk food sits underneath text introducing me to the diagnosis, encouraging me to ask my female patients if they sometimes regret how much they eat, because they may be ashamed to talk about it.\nWe're a nation of addicts Dennis Byrne If we weren't such a nation of addicts, maybe hordes of drug smugglers wouldn't crash our borders to feed our habit.\nMaybe drug cartels wouldn't terrorize Mexico and Central America — our gift to our southern neighbors.\nMaybe drunks wouldn't kill so many on our highways, or our health-care system...\nIf we weren't such a nation of addicts, maybe hordes of drug smugglers wouldn't crash our borders to feed our habit.\nMaybe drug cartels wouldn't terrorize Mexico and Central America — our gift to our southern neighbors.\nMaybe drunks wouldn't kill so many on our highways, or our health-care system...\n(Dennis Byrne) These ads were paid for by Shire Pharmaceuticals, the same company that makes the amphetamine Adderall. But Adderall has lost its patent, hence Vyvanse, a new, ultra, long-acting amphetamine. Shire's newer ADHD ads also target women, recommending Vyvanse for 12-hour control of symptoms “throughout her day.”\nIt's getting harder to remain unmedicated in the Altered States of America. Street drugs, speed and heroin have come in from the cold, and are now Adderall or Vyvanse, OxyContin or Zohydro, as Big Pharma expands into the recreational market. More women are becoming addicted to opiates and dying of overdoses, and more women are taking antidepressants and sleeping pills than ever before. We are medicating away our sensitivities and we are all the worse for it. Women are being convinced that it's pathological to be emotional.\nThe first thing a woman says after she starts crying is, “I'm sorry.” We are uncomfortable with expressed emotion, and we have been socialized to shut it down. But by suppressing this sensitivity, we're stifling a piece that we need, that our partners and families need, and that the world needs. When we are overmedicated as a nation, we lose our empathy, the natural connection to humanity.\nAfter 20 years of psychiatric practice, it's clear to me that women today need more soothing than ever. Beyond our jobs and families, we are exposed to traumas worldwide, courtesy of our phones. Our empathy goes out across the country to kids shot on campuses; globally, weapons bought with our taxes kill doctors and children. We are wired for empathy, but it is all too much. For many, psychiatric medications are a temporary Band-Aid; adding amphetamines is not going to help. For real solutions, we have to look beyond the prescription medical model and toward a more holistic approach.\nWith soaring drug prices and insurance premiums, it is no wonder a revolution is slowly brewing, with more Americans taking their health care into their own hands. They are rediscovering an herbal model of health care, using remedies with names like Phoenix Tears and Charlotte's Web. The medicinal cannabis community is growing, educating and supporting one another. There is no patenting a flower.\nCannabis is an ancient medicinal plant, a weed that cleans the air better than trees and puts nutrients into the soil. The crop yields tons of hemp seeds — a complete vegetarian protein, oil for biodiesel and fiber for paper, canvas, rope, building materials, compostable packaging, and the list goes on. Forget Donald Trump, hemp can make America great again.\nAnd, of course, there's the flower of the female plant: a painkilling, anti-inflammatory, metabolism-regulating, cancer-killing, heart-opening medicine. Side effects include a shift in perception, a dehabituation that may help you reconnect to the earth, to your own body and to each other. Cannabis can help you to feel more, not less.\nAm I suggesting you ditch the antidepressants, opiates and amphetamines in favor of a natural remedy? Not always. But the balance needs to shift. And I do at least want to pose the question: If we have a choice, isn't a natural mood better than a synthetic one?\nTribune Content Agency\nPsychiatrist Julie Holland is author of “Moody Bitches: The Truth About The Drugs You're Taking, the Sleep You're Missing, the Sex You're Not Having, and What's Really Making You Crazy.” She is editor of “The Pot Book: A Complete Guide to Cannabis.”\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Drugs and Medicines", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561d5852/turbine/ct-prescription-drugs-psychiatric-medications-20151013", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54cfa5cf/turbine/ct-institute-of-drug-abuse-gallup-0203-20150202"], "published": "2015-10-13T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:29:00.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
