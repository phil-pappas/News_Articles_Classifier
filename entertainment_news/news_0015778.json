She's getting the help she needs.'' \nHayden previously opened up about postpartum depression, insisting it should be ''talked about'' more. \nShe shared: ''I can very much relate. It's something a lot of women experience. When you're told about postpartum depression you think it's, 'I feel negative feelings towards my child, I want to injure or hurt my child' - I've never, ever had those feelings. Some women do. But you don't realise how broad of a spectrum you can really experience that on. It's something that needs to be talked about. Women need to know that they're not alone, and that it does heal. \n''There's a lot of misunderstanding - there's a lot of people out there that think that it's not real, that it's not true, that it's something that's made up in their minds, that, 'Oh, it's hormones.' They brush it off. It's something that's completely uncontrollable. It's really painful and it's really scary and women need a lot of support.''
