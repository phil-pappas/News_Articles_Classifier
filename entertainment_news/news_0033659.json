Stine earned $23.5 million across the weekend, according to Sony's estimates Sunday. It cost a reported $58 million to produce. \n\"Goosebumps\" also managed to beat \"The Martian\" by a hair, pushing Ridley Scott's adventure to the second-place spot for the first time in its three-week run with $21.5 million. \nSteven Spielberg's well-received cold-war thriller \"Bridge of Spies,\" debuted in third place with $15.4 million. \nGuillermo del Toro's R-rated gothic romance \"Crimson Peak\" opened in fourth place with $12.8 million. It's one of del Toro's lowest wide openings after 1997's \"Mimic,\" which earned only $7.8 million in its first weekend in theatres. Rate this This article has not yet been rated.
