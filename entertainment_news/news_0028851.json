Reports said alcohol, cocaine and sexual stimulants were found in Odom's system. \nKardashian, whose divorce from Odom is pending but not final, has stayed by Odom's side since his hospitalization. People reports that her current boyfriend, Houston Rockets shooting guard James Harden, has been supportive. \nOdom, who was in a coma for four days, spent a week at Las Vegas Sunrise Hospital & Medical Center before being airlifted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles Monday. \nKhole's complete statement reads: \n\"The past week has been incredibly difficult. I am so thankful to family, friends and fans who have sent nothing but prayers and well wishes to Lamar. I also want to take a moment to thank everyone at Sunrise Hospital, inlcuding the amazing doctors and nurses for their kindness and diligent work. Under their amazing care, incredible, strides have been made. You can never be prepared for an experience like this, but without the outpouring of love and endless prayers Lamar has received and the strength I was given from my loved ones, it would have been difficult to endure. Thank you for your continued support. God is great!!!\" \nHer family has also posted encouraging messages on social media. \nA photo posted by King Kylie (@kyliejenner) on Oct 15, 2015 at 9:27am PDT \nA photo posted by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Oct 17, 2015 at 9:44pm PDT \nA photo posted by @krisjenner on Oct 17, 2015 at 9:07pm PDT \nA photo posted by ROBERT KARDASHIAN (@robkardashian) on Oct 14, 2015 at 6:35pm PDT \nA photo posted by Kourtney Kardashian (@kourtneykardash) on Oct 15, 2015 at 10:52am PDT", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T06:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T15:05:55.091+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
