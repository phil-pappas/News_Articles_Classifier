LOUIS â€” Before the first-ever Cubs-Cardinals postseason game, a St. Louis reporter from St. Louis asked Anthony Rizzo if he expected an all-out war.\n\"All-out war?\" Rizzo replied. \"No, I look for it to be a baseball game. Up to five games.\"\nSo far, Rizzo's right.\nThe Cubs and Cardinals played a terrific October game Friday night without any histrionics, vigilantism or brouhahas.\nThe Cardinals wound up with a 4-0 triumph in Game 1 of the National League Division Series behind the brilliant pitching of John Lackey, but there was no reason to panic, no reason to curse.\nJoe Maddon's 30-minute rule of celebrating a victory and grieving a loss has been drilled into his players' heads since opening day. It's no different in the playoffs, despite the magnitude of the games.\nThere was no doubt the Cubs had issues with plate umpire Phil Cuzzi's strike zone, but no one blamed it for the loss.\n\"We'll be fine,\" catcher David Ross said. \"We'll come in here (Saturday). We've already been talking about 'Let's get tomorrow' and we'll be even and it's a shorter series and we get to go home.\n\"And we have Jake (Arrieta) going (in Game 3).\"\nJon Lester looked like a $155 million pitcher Friday, battling into the eighth inning of 1-0 game until getting pulled after a home run and a walk. But the Cubs didn't have any scoring opportunities until the sixth, when Dexter Fowler's two-out shot to right field landed in Randal Grichuk's glove at the warning track with Addison Russell on third.\n\"I've hit balls worse than that that went out of here,\" Fowler said. \"I squared it up, and that's all you can do.\"\nStill, the Cubs had a chance until the eighth when Lester gave up a homer to Tommy Pham and Pedro Strop served up a two-run homer to Stephen Piscotty after the walk to Matt Carpenter.\nIt's easy to make this division series between longtime rivals bigger than it is. No matter the history of the rivals or the fans' animosity toward each other, it's still just a first-round playoff game, not the World Series.\nThe build-up was massive considering there was only one day between the Cubs wild-card victory over the Pirates and Game 1, but the fact is this is uncharted territory for this particular Cubs' team, so every postseason game is going to seem like it's life or death to some, even if this loss was only a flesh wound.\nMaddon may get criticized for using Strop in a meaningful situation against a team that owns him, and for letting left-handed hitting Chris Coghlan bat against lefty Kevin Siegrist in the eighth when it was still a one-run game.\nBut Maddon has no doghouse and counts on Strop in those situations, and he pointed out Siegrist has better splits against right-handed hitters (a .179 career average against) than lefties (.226).\nStrop has given up eight earned runs in 22/3 innings at Busch Stadium this year, and 10 earned runs in eight innings to the Cardinals overall. You could call it the Bob Costas curse after the MLB Network broadcaster famously ripped Strop's finger-pointing-to-the-sky routine after a bad performance in June, but Costas apologized long ago.\nSo why does Strop struggle so much against the Cardinals?\n\"Good question,\" Ross said. \"We'll have to try to figure that out, won't we? I don't know why. If I knew why, the result probably wouldn't have happened. I don't even have a guess for you.\"\nWe did learn some things Friday night, and not just that handing out rally towels is a trite way to get your fans involved.\nWe also learned the Cubs know how to make a point about a Chicago pothole-sized strike zone without actually saying it.\nThey credited Lackey and said they took the right approach.\nBut Maddon conceded they had to \"expand our strike zone\" and swing at pitches outside the zone to avoid strikeouts.\n\"He was around the dish,\" Fowler said. \"I think we waited patiently. He made his pitches and everything else took care of itself. We did our job. We battled. We took some close pitches. Things just didn't go our way.\"\nAs the 30-minute rule ended Friday, it was time to move on. The Cardinals, we know, are a 100-win team, and the Cubs will have to play a near-perfect game to beat them.\nBut they have done it before.\nThere's no reason to believe they can't do it again.\npsullivan@tribpub.com\nTwitter @PWSullivan\nPrivacy Policy Major League Baseball Baseball Chicago Cubs St. Louis Cardinals Dexter Fowler Anthony Rizzo David Ross", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56188eb9/turbine/ct-moving-on-cubs-sullivan-spt-1010-20151009"], "published": "2015-10-10T07:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:27:29.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
