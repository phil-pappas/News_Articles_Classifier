Compared to untreated neutrophils, they found that tamoxifen-treated neutrophils were better at moving toward and phagocytosing, or engulfing, bacteria.\nTamoxifen-treated neutrophils also produced approximately three-fold more neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), a mesh of DNA, antimicrobial peptides, enzymes and other proteins that neutrophils spew out to ensnare and kill pathogens.\nTreating neutrophils with other molecules that target the estrogen receptor had no effect, suggesting that tamoxifen enhances NET production in a way unrelated to the estrogen receptor.\nFurther studies linked the tamoxifen effect to its ability to influence neutrophil ceramide levels.\nThe team also tested Tamoxifen’s immune-boosting effect in a mouse model. One hour after treatment with tamoxifen or a control, the researchers infected mice with MRSA.\nThey treated the mice again with tamoxifen or the control one and eight hours after infection and monitored them for five days.\nTamoxifen significantly protected mice – none of the control mice survived longer than one day after infection, while about 35 per cent of the tamoxifen-treated mice survived five days.\nApproximately five times fewer MRSA were collected from the peritoneal fluid of the tamoxifen-treated mice, as compared to control mice.\nThe study was published in the journal Nature Communications.\n 14, 2015 7:59 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:12:25.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
