The FBI has assisted with the investigation by offering the reward, said Gates Police Chief James VanBrederode at a news conference Friday afternoon. He said he's treating this as an attempted murder case, noting that the suspect pushed a 74-year-old into the Genesee River with a six-foot embankment.\nThis is a surveillance photo, released by the Gates Police Department, of the person of interest in Wednesday's kidnapping case. (Photo: Provided photo)\n\"At 74 years old, I think the intent is clear. Their intent was to kill that person, for whatever reason,\" VanBrederode said.\nVanBrederode said his officers are looking for an African-American man in his 20s of average height who appears to walk with a slight limp on the right side. Police said they recovered a black Dickies jacket belonging to the suspect.\nVanBrederode added that the suspect likely walked from his home in the Genesee section, which is patrolled by that section of the Rochester Police Department. It extends from Exchange Street on the river to Gates. The person of interest walked down Westfield Street to Chili Avenue into the town. Based on his walking patterns, VanBrederode said the suspect appears to be from that neighborhood.\nSupervisor Mark Assini, Adam Cohen, special agent in charge of the FBI's Buffalo Division, and New York State Police were also on hand for the announcement.\nLIVE on #Periscope : Gates carjacking/kidnapping update. https://t.co/Mgeg7AHPlq\n— Will Cleveland (@WillCleveland13) October 23, 2015 The incident started about 1:20 p.m. after a man failed in an attempt to rob C. Stefanou Realtors on Chili Avenue. VanBrederode said it's unclear why the suspect targeted the real estate office.\nThe suspect ran away, carrying a handgun, and crossed Chili Avenue to Sprucewood Lane, where the woman lives. He forced her into her car and drove it three miles toward the Genesee River near Flint Street in Rochester.\nHe then abandoned the car, with the front passenger wheel dangling over the ledge and the water. When police arrived, they found the woman in the 52-degree water.\n“At 74 years old, I think the intent is clear. Their intent was to kill that person, for whatever reason.”\nGates Police Chief James VanBrederode The woman was rescued by the Rochester Fire Department and taken to Strong Memorial Hospital, but she has been released.\nThose with more information about the crime are asked to call 911 or contact Crime Stoppers at 585-423-9300.\nWCLEVELAND@Gannett.com\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nWoman abducted, later pulled from river\nGates Police Chief James VanBrederode speaks from the scene of the river rescue Wednesday.
