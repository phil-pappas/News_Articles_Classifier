Parrinello, 76, of Rochester, requested a trial by jury for the misdemeanor charge. The trial date was set for 5:30 p.m. Aug. 8, 2016.\nThe charges stem from an incident that allegedly occurred on Aug. 16 at the Gates Motel.\nHis attorney David Rothenberg also requested a motion hearing, stating he would like to file motions after discovery is received from the prosecution. That's set for Feb. 10.\n\"John Parrinello has plead not guilty, because he is innocent of this outrageous charge,\" Rothenberg said in a prepared statement after the arraignment. \"We intend to defend the charge vigorously. And at the end of the case when John is vindicated, he intends to pursue every available remedy to hold accountable all those officials who are responsible for this miscarriage of justice.\"\nWhen asked about where the charges stemmed from, Parrinello became defiant.\n\"At no time in my lifetime have I ever patronized a prostitute,\" Parrinello said. \"That includes on Aug. 16, 2015, and as David said, we're going to pursue this thing very vigorously. We have asked for a jury trial. We have a control date. We're waiting for information to come to us from the District Attorney's Office. And we will then wait for them to be able to produce any evidence.\"\"\nRothenberg added, \"I'm not trying this court in the press. I'm trying this case in the courtroom.\"\nWCLEVELAND@Gannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T02:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:45:42.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
