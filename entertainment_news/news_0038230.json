In the said outing, the remaining of the Kappa members attempt to contact Chanel No. 2's spirit and it appears that they're successful as Chanel No. 2 is seen visiting Chanel No. 1 ( Emma Roberts ) in some photos. Another image sees a funeral, possibly of Chanel No. 2, with Chanel No. 1, Chanel No. 3 ( Billie Lourd ), Chanel No. 5 ( Abigail Breslin ), Chanel No. 6 ( Lea Michele ), Chad Radwell (Glen Powell) and more in attendance. There's also a picture of Dean Cathy Munsch ( Jamie Lee Curtis ) wearing a straightjacket while being escorted by a police officer. Titled \"Beware of Young Girls\", the new episode is scheduled to air Tuesday, November 3 at 9/8c on FOX. According to the synopsis, Dean Munsch is left in a desperate situation when a shocking event leads her to come face-to-face with her ex-husband's mistress. Meanwhile, in an attempt to determine who the Red Devil killer is, the Kappas use a Ouija board to communicate with Chanel No. 2 from beyond the grave and learn of a wicked plot against one of their own. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T05:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:06:57.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
