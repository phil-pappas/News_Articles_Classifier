Adapter Anne Washburn gave us the sharp, offbeat “Mr. Burns” and “10 Out of 12,” though director Rachel Chavkin was behind the inventively staged “Natasha, Pierre and the Fantastic Comet of 1812” and “Small Mouth Sounds.”\nExcellent accomplishments, all. But in “Iphigenia,” the audience is caught in a frantic whirlwind — have I described the live folk-rock music? — that fails to create emotional traction.\nExcept, that is, when Kristen Sieh takes center stage as Iphigenia. It is a commanding performance despite its intimate scale, in particular when Iphigenia delivers an impassioned monologue to plead for her life. It fails to convince her dad (Campbell once again), so Iphigenia rationalizes her impending death by morphing from sacrificial lamb to willing heroine — and Sieh, standing practically still, brilliantly captures both modes. She makes the busyness that surrounds these scenes seem yet much more ludicrous.\n ", "external_links": ["http://nypost.com/2015/09/18/kristen-siehs-star-turn-cant-save-ludicrous-adaptation-of-greek-tragedy/"], "published": "2015-09-20T06:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:09:35.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
