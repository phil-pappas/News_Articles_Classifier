So hip that frontman Daniel Armbruster is blogging on the Huffington Post . And the band is drawing big crowds on the road.\n“Last night we were in Chicago and it was sold out, 500 people,” Armbruster says. “Almost all of this tour has been sold out.”\nThe indie-rock favorite have been on tour since March with the release of its first full-length album, How Do You Feel Now? It’s only sighting in Rochester since then was a surprise show in April at the Bug Jar, announced that morning to fans through social media. The band finally makes an official tour stop in its home town on Saturday, with a show at the East Avenue club Anthology.\nHuffington Post is offering a set of 13 blogs by Armbruster, with the first three up as of this week. His musings document the making of the album, which unavoidably drifts over into the Joywave philosophy.\n“No one should take themselves too seriously,” Armbruster says. That’s a main Joywave tenant. “A lot of people are concerned with being too cool. But that whole indie crowd kind of holds you back.”\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nBand Joywave sponsors Little League team\nArmbruster, Sean Donnelly, Paul Brenner, Joseph Morinelli and Benjamin Bailey float outside the box on a current of electronic sound, samples, synth pop and intensely brittle words of self examination. All of it danceable. This from what was once a decent rootsy Rochester club band called The Hoodies, although Armbruster talks as though those musicians (Armbruster, Brenner and Morinelli are Hoodies alumni) were completely different people. Which they were, the difference being, “Growing up,” he says. “That band ended almost seven years ago. I’m an adult now.”\nThe songs of How Do You Feel Now? were largely drawn from Armbruster’s days — which became months, then years — after graduating from college, “trying to figure out what I was going to do. Which is not really a thing in Rochester, because there are no jobs here.”\nJoywave seems to have engaged in a great many existential conversations since then. Some of them even involved music. “Things that rappers do that bands don’t do, and why don’t bands do that?” Armbruster says. “The lifestyle, stealing songs from each other and putting their words on them.”\nOf course, Joywave did that as well. “We took Flaming Lips songs and LCD Sound System songs and put our vocals on top of them,” Armbruster says. But that’s all a part of a guitar-based rock band learning to grow out its wires.\nCollaboration has been a big deal in that growth. Joywave has worked with Rochester bands such as KOPPS and the harpist and singer-songwriter Mikaela Davis, both of whom appear on How Do You Feel Now? They're playing at Saturday's show along with Portland's Grace Mitchell and, as the band promises on its Facebook site, “special guests and a few surprises.”\nJoywave also collaborated with the Brooklyn electronica musician Big Data on “Dangerous,” which went to No. 4 on Billboard ’s Alternative Songs chart, with the two acts performing the song in 2014 on Late Night with Seth Meyers , along with Joywave’s own “Tongues.” Joywave has also played the giant indie fest Lollapalooza, once the coolest event on the planet.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nJoywave spends Late Night With Seth Meyers\nAs Armbruster notes, the indie-rock crowd can exhibit a herd mentality, seeking out what is cool at the moment. He sees Joywave as bucking that idea. “We do what we do when we want to do it,” he says.\nBucking everything, really. How Do You Feel Now? was released by Hollywood Records, whose parent company is Disney. Which made the band wonder, Armbruster says, “maybe they would let us sample some of the Disney animated films?”\nOf course, Papa Disney said, you look like nice kids. Joywave was handed the key to the vault and lifted vocal samples from the films Fantasia and Bambi . The closing seconds of the album’s final cut, “Bad Dreams,” is lifted directly from the underscore of Peter Pan .\nThis comforting familiarity brings to the record the Disneyland coda of “Synthetic happiness, everything has never been better,” Armbruster says. “A place where nothing is wrong. If someone threw up and became ill, they’d be whisked away. It’s all sunniness, zoning out.”\nBut few bands of any merit emerge from a land of sunniness. It was not long ago that Joywave played a show in New England, and no one showed up. Not a single person.\n“It’s one of those, ‘We have to do this,’ things,” Armbruster says. “We just kind of looked at each other, kind of thinking: Are we in a Spinal Tap sequel now? But moments like that are always entertaining, always funny. Playing to zero people in New England will never not be funny.”\njspevak@gannett.com\nIf you go\nWhat: Joywave, with Grace Mitchell, Mikaela Davis and KOPPS.\nWhen: 8 p.m Saturday.\nWhere: Anthology, 336 East Ave.\nTickets: $15 advance, $18 the day of the show, available at ticketfly.com, (877) 435-9849, Aaron’s Alley, House of Guitars and Record Archive.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d84815213d2d14b2ce2ad40acd756004c9adbbf2/c=0-184-533-717/local/-/media/Rochester/2014/07/29/joywave.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/39abcaf26feb18cabee840e5463c1cac94d04f89/c=27-0-2029-2002/local/-/media/2015/05/02/Rochester/Rochester/635661697381281999-JW-LL-Opener-050215-Sports-B.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-07T00:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:32:47.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
