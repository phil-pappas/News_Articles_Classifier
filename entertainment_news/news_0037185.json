Kumar, who has lent his voice to recent songs like 'Jee Karda' ('Badlapur') and 'G Phaad Ke' ('Happy Ending'), was supposed to perform on all nine days of the festival (October 13-21) after his fiancée, Ankita Jhunjhunwala allegedly failed to get adequate sponsors on board.\n\nDivya Kumar \nPradeep Jaiswal, co-founder of Caravan Events which organised the show, claims his company has suffered a loss of Rs 30 lakh. \"Ankita approached us to partner with her for the show. We decided to invest for the first few days and she was supposed to get sponsors later, but she didn't,\" says Jaiswal.\nTrouble surfaced after vendors, including stage decorators and electricians, started asking for payment on the second day of the show. \"We asked Ankita to make the payments, but she refused. However, the next day, she cleared the dues and started making announcements that she had single-handedly organised the show. We told people that we were not partnering with her although we made all arrangements for the show and obtained an NOC for the ground. How can she run the show? We have apprised the Tilak Nagar police about this,\" adds Jaiswal.\nAnkita denies being asked to get sponsors. \"They did not want the show to go on and approached Tilak Nagar police, who asked us to mutually resolve the matter. But, the show won't resume. The mess has left artistes disturbed; this is not also good for a singer's reputation,\" she says.\n—Anirban Das \nMoolah Matters... \nCheque out!
