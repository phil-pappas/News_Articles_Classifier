Rich, who weighs nearly 30 stone, had a gastric bypass that caused him \"extreme gas and uncontrollable diaharrea\", according to the suit.\nThe suit claims that the owners of the company began harassing Rich and his wife began to overpower the office, even the actual smell of the meat product they make. It also claims that the smell of Rich's farts became so off-putting, he asked him to work from home.\nAccording to the suit, Rich claims he was fired in 2014 when the smell became too much. However, the owners say that wasn't the case at all.\nTom Grieb, president of Case Pork Roll Company, says that the business was faltering and all staff had to take a pay reduction. \"They were never discriminated against,‚Äù Grieb explained. \"Even I took a pay cut. He refused and he just walked out. That was the end of it.\"\nThe case continues.\nVia MyNewJersey.com\nMORE: Japanese restaurant introduces curry that actually tastes like human shit\nMORE: Watch: Oh nothing, just a giant bear out for a stroll through the neighbourhood\nMORE: Pic: Rock formation on the Moon looks like a human face", "external_links": ["http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/2015/10/01/pork-roll-maker-sued-worker-who-passed-too-much-gas/73082296/"], "published": "2015-10-04T01:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:21:18.473+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
