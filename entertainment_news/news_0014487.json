Pat Quinn offered the smartphone company more than $100 million in tax incentives over 10 years to keep its headquarters in north suburban Libertyville. The announcement focused on Motorola's threat to take its 3,000 good-paying jobs to California or Texas. Facing that prospect, Illinois ponied up.\nSoon after, the Tribune reported that Motorola actually employed 3,290 people, but Quinn's contract required retaining just 2,500 jobs — meaning Illinois wanted this win so badly it was willing to compensate Motorola Mobility even if it laid off nearly 800 people .\nEventually Motorola's money-for-nothing jobs deal slipped the surly bonds of Earth. The company, a shadow of its former self, cut so many positions the tax credits became worthless.\nWhat lived on was Illinois' penchant for these kinds of costly incentives. A Tribune report last weekend dove deep into the state's flagship jobs program, known as EDGE. It found at least 78 examples of companies offered tax credits without being required to hire even one new employee. Of those, two dozen companies got incentive deals on such lenient terms they collectively cut 3,000 jobs and remained eligible.\nThese arrangements should be economic development tools that create jobs and grow tax revenue for the state over the long term. Yet many times Illinois promised money to companies that either held the line on hiring or downsized. For example, the Tribune said Illinois awarded $1.1 million in tax credits to Follett Corp., a west suburban provider of educational products, despite the company eliminating 122 jobs.\nFirms get millions in credits (charts) Tribune Graphics The Economic Development for a Growing Economy program, or EDGE, is a tax incentive designed to create jobs and lure businesses from other states.

Um, Illinois does. That's what happens when your state is in ruinous financial shape: You run scared.\nThere's a history in Illinois and other states hungry for job growth of offering lavish tax incentives and benefits to employers. It goes like this:\n•Chase the jobs with eye-popping offers.\n•Cue marching bands when Company X agrees to stay in, or relocate to, your state.\n•Debate the value of these deals based on emotion and guesswork, not on hard data.\nThe value of the Tribune report, by Michael J. Berens and Ray Long, is it fills in some important gaps in knowledge of a program state government never fully analyzed. Since 2001, the state earmarked $1.1 billion in EDGE tax credits. Of that, companies collected about $450.3 million, the Tribune found. In the 2014 fiscal year, Illinois diverted a record $101.7 million in tax revenue to cover EDGE credits.\nState officials couldn't provide a detailed analysis of the program's performance. We couldn't find an independent analysis. There's just an assumption that paying companies to be here is a good idea because, well, other states do it, so things will be worse if we don't play along.\nIllinois businesses get lucrative EDGE tax breaks, fall short of job goals Michael J. Berens and Ray Long Illinois' flagship job program has awarded millions of dollars to companies that never hired an additional employee.\nIt's doled out millions more in tax breaks for corporations that eliminated jobs and became smaller.\nAnd it's allowed companies to reap lucrative rewards and then relocate to other...\nIllinois' flagship job program has awarded millions of dollars to companies that never hired an additional employee.\nIt's doled out millions more in tax breaks for corporations that eliminated jobs and became smaller.\nAnd it's allowed companies to reap lucrative rewards and then relocate to other...\n(Michael J. Berens and Ray Long) Yet a lot of participants in this jobs program didn't fulfill their pledges: 2 of every 3 businesses failed to maintain the number of employees they agreed to retain, or to hire as many as they anticipated. That's not surprising; businesses unexpectedly grow and shrink. At one point, Motorola was the world's greatest cellphone company. These days Motorola Mobility is a small subsidiary of Lenovo, a Chinese tech company.\nBut should Illinois taxpayers be paying hundreds of millions of dollars to ride these corporate roller-coasters?\nQuinn believed in EDGE as a defensive weapon. At least 51 of the 78 deals that didn't require more jobs were done on his watch. His argument: When the economy stinks and other states try to poach your employers, you pay to keep them.\nSure, in some competitive situations, it might make sense to deploy tax credits. There's some added value to the program because it requires participants to make specific investments. But Illinois became desperate and every CEO knew it. Companies expected handouts, and EDGE expanded to the point that even income tax credits weren't enough. Some companies didn't have tax bills, so they asked to keep in their own pockets payroll tax money they collected from employees.\nAnd Illinois said yes.\nAt the heart of these deals was Team Quinn's desperation. Businesses might have come here, or stayed, without incentives, but Illinois wouldn't risk losing.\nYet that happened. Ag giant ADM asked Illinois for $30 million in special payroll tax incentives over 20 years to shift its headquarters from Decatur to Chicago. When the legislature balked, ADM came anyway. Because — say it loudly — Chicago is a great place to do business.\nGov. Bruce Rauner doesn't like the incentive model and has put a bunch of deals on hold. Good. His commerce director, Jim Schultz, says these incentive deals represent a \"race to the bottom.\"\nIllinois needs jobs, but incentives should be low on the list of sales pitches. The state should be desirable because of its location, skilled workforce, great schools and entrepreneurial spirit. Some day soon we hope to add more attributes: stable government finances, reasonable taxes and regulations, efficient licensing.\nHanding out taxpayer dollars is a weak growth strategy. Illinois will be a lot more attractive if it solves its real-world problems … and works on its salesmanship.\n Job Layoffs Unemployment and Layoffs Jobs and Workplace Motorola Mobility Lenovo Group Ltd.
