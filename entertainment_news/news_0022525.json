Photo: Sony Pictures \n1. THE SCARLET EMPRESS (104 minutes) Unrated \nJoseph von Sternberg's incomparable cycle of collaborations with Marlene Dietrich culminated in 1934 with this ultra-decadent biopic of Catherine the Great, portrayed with some sympathy as she develops from naive girl to all-powerful tyrant. Sternberg's characteristic expressionist imagery is at its most outlandish and sinister, while Dietrich's wide-eyed pantomime of innocence suggests a joke shared with the viewer. Screens in conjunction with the Masterpieces from the Hermitage exhibition, with introduction by Dr Lorraine Mortimer. Digitally projected. National Gallery of Victoria, today, 2pm.\n2. BLOW OUT (107 minutes) M \nMia Wasikowska stars in Guillermo del Toro's romantic gothic horror film Crimson Peak . \nBrian de Palma's cynical yet romantic sensibility is seen at its purest in this 1981 conspiracy thriller, which combines elements of slasher movie, screwball comedy and experimental cinema with a touch of genuine tragedy. John Travolta excels as the hapless hero, a sound effects man who inadvertently records evidence of a political assassination. Screens as part of a Surveillance in Cinema retrospective at the Melbourne Festival. Digitally projected. ACMI, today, 7pm.\nAdvertisement 3. THE GODFATHER (175 minutes) MA \nFrancis Ford Coppola's 1972 gangster epic needs no introduction – an utterly assured piece of storytelling that has defined the world's notion of the Mafia ever since. Marlon Brando remains just on the right side of burlesque as the old-school don Vito Corleone, while Al Pacino as his son Michael is the still centre of the sound and fury. Digitally projected. Astor, tomorrow, 7pm.\nMarlon Brando in The Godfather . \n4. THE WALK (123 minutes) PG \nFrench daredevil Philippe Petit made history in 1974 when he walked between the towers of the World Trade Centre; the story has been told before, but in any form it's a great yarn. This whimsical, technically elaborate dramatisation from Robert Zemeckis ( Back to the Future ) lets star Joseph Gordon-Levitt display his gifts as a showman in his own right. General.\n5. CRIMSON PEAK (119 minutes) MA \nA specialist in macabre pastiche, Guillermo del Toro​ ( Pan's Labyrinth ) pulls out all the stops with this gaudy, gory period ghost story, which mashes up elements from Rebecca , The Fall of the House of Usher , and more. Mia Wasikowska leads an ideal cast as an American heiress and aspiring writer courted by a pale baronet (Tom Hiddleston).
