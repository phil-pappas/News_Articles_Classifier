We’ve assembled some of the very best talent both in front of and behind the camera and I can’t wait to see it all come together.” \nTed Chapin, president of Rodgers and Hammerstein: An Imagem Company, added: “The Sound Of Music really is in a class by itself. The notion of creating a production for live television broadcast is a large undertaking, and one we are delighted ITV has taken on for what will undoubtedly be a Christmas time treat for the whole of the UK.” \nThe Sound Of Music – based on Maria von Trapp’s 1949 memoir The Story Of The Trapp Family Singers – inspired a 1956 German film, the original Broadway musical in 1959 and various stage revivals.
