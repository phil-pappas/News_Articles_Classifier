Rough Cut (no reporter narration)   \nROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) In a week which saw Meryl Streep speak out about equal pay and the other stars of the film \"Suffragette\" applaud the protesters who invaded their premiere, Variety magazine's event Power of Women wasn't going to be a quiet affair. The event, which celebrates \"Hollywood's most philanthropic and inspiring women\", saw Oprah Winfrey, Anna Kendrick, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, and CEO and chairman of Twentieth Century Fox Jim Gianopulos being honored. Also honored was Salma Hayek Pinault, who joined the discussion about equal pay, saying, \"We've been trying to talk about it for a long time. Patricia Arquette was so eloquent but was not the first one to talk about equality on an Oscar speech but now all of a sudden people are starting to listen so I am very hopeful. I feel that women are more united than ever and I think it's now more obvious than ever and that people are beginning to show some support because we are - our demographic - a very strong economical power also as movie goers. And I think this has now been clearly identified and I think it's now the biggest difference.\" \"Well let's clarify. This isn't just Hollywood. This is a problem that is in every single industry,\" she added. \"If you have the same capacities and you are doing the same job, it is criminal not to pay the same salary.\" Gwyneth Paltrow, who was also an honoree and 12th on Forbes' highest paid actresses in Hollywood this year with $9 million, said, \"For a long long time it was considered really bad to be a woman in Hollywood and say 'hey! I see a disparity here or here'. You were considered ungrateful, you were considered entitled so I think it's amazing that women now are saying 'we're going to talk about this. This isn't fair' and I think it's really interesting to be watching the discussion.\" When asked if she saw an end in sight where pay will be equal between the sexes, Paltrow replied, \"I think so. When I look at my daughter and her peers and I look at the millennial women, I think it's all about to change.\" Other attendees at the event included model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and actresses Reese Witherspoon, Maria Bello, Thandie Newton and Lisa Kudrow.  //reut.rs/1Mj64Zk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:37:07.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
