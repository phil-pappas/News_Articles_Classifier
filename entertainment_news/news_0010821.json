Emily Tess Katz Associate Editor, HuffPost Live Posted: 10/16/2015 05:17 PM EDT | Edited: 2 minutes ago \nJessica Chastain invoked the Hollywood wage gap afflicting today's actresses in a HuffPost Live conversation on Friday, alluding to a recent report that suggested she made $7 million for \"The Martian\"-- a whopping $18 million less than her co-star Matt Damon. According to the actress, however, their paycheck disparity far exceeds that. \n\"I've actually never said this, I think, so here we go: There's also misinformation out there,\" Chastain told host Alex Miranda. \"Like someone wrote an article once that said I made a certain amount of money for 'The Martian.' I made less than a quarter of that in reality. And so people are already saying, 'Well, she's making a lot less than her male co-stars because she's making this.' I made less than a quarter of that in reality, so there is a huge wage gap in the industry.\" \nWith actresses like Jennifer Lawrence sharing their personal stories of making significantly less than the men acting alongside them, the \"Crimson Peak\" actress feels the movement to close the wage gap has made progress, and she's hopeful that more will follow. \n\"It's wonderful that people are starting to talk about the wage gap, and really [admit] that it's an issue,\" she said. \"Women can talk about it, [but] it actually moves me a lot to hear men talk about it as well. I think the film industry is an incredible group of people ... and so the more that we all discuss it as a community, that's what I think is going to help.\" \nWatch more from Jessica Chastain and Tom Hiddleston's conversation with HuffPost Live here.
