This stunning political thriller captures the years 1979 to 1981, when the most well-known freedom fighter of his country was in prison, along with other leaders of his liberation party.\nThe story opens in Stellenbosch, a picturesque university town 40 kilometres from Cape Town. Two students are discussing politics as they play golf. One is a staunch right winger and the other is a liberal. Fate thrusts them into unpredictable roles. The masses are in disarray and most of its leaders are in prison. For human freedom to succeed, the release of their inspirational leader must happen. The man has already been imprisoned for 16 years, and with his health failing, time is of the essence.\nHow can they break their charismatic leader out of a penitentiary that has never before been penetrated? No one has ever escaped and lived to tell the tale. The followers form a task force and approach the Soviets for help, but they have their own agenda. What will happen on the \"Day of Reckoning?\"\nWatch the video at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1RHX1Nywvw&feature=youtu.be\nAbout the Author: A retired architect, first-time author Leon Diamond grew up in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, and now lives in Johannesburg.
