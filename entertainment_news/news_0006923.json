Morgan, a former SNL star himself, pretends he doesn't remember working for the show. \nMorgan later smiles and says, \"Yeah, I remember. I remember everything. Yeah, I remember you owe me $72.\" \n\"Are you sure?\" Moynihan asks. \n\"It might have been $78,\" Morgan replies. \n\"I think that was [former cast member] Horatio Sanz,\" Moynihan points out. \n\"Right,\" Morgan agrees. \nIn another promo, Morgan cracks, \"I'm going to get everyone in this building pregnant!\" \nMorgan hosts NBC's Saturday Night Live this weekend, with musical guest Demi Lovato. \nSNL marks another milestone in Morgan's comeback from the accident. Last month, he presented at the Emmy Awards, and earlier this week he performed stand-up at a New York City club. In addition, he will make an appearance at the Kennedy Center gala this Sunday honoring Eddie Murphy as the 2015 recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
