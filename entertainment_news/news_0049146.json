Hundreds of houses in Swillburg, which is home to landmarks like the Highland Park Diner, Cinema Theatre and Rooney's Restaurant, faced demolition to make way for an expressway to extend what is now Interstate 390 to Interstate 490.\nBut outspoken residents and community groups helped to sway City Council to kill the project on Sept. 17, 1975.\nOn Thursday, the neighborhood will celebrate the 40th anniversary of that decisive vote. Organizers argue that it marks the salvation of Swillburg and an example of citizens fighting for their best interests — and winning.\n\"In this case, the people influenced the decision instead of the big, big powers that be,\" said Mike Henry, a Swillburg resident who has traced the history of the ill-fated Genesee Expressway project.\nThe idea for the 3.2-mile highway had been around since at least the 1960s and would have cut through part of Brighton, too. Business and union leaders supported the project, arguing that it would create jobs and allow drivers to get in and out of downtown more easily.\nBut many Swillburg residents said the project would have destroyed their triangle-shaped neighborhood in the city's southeast quadrant, bordered by I-490, Field and Meigs streets and South Clinton Avenue. The tight-knit community is purportedly named after the swill once collected there by pig farmer George Goebel, before German and Irish immigrants settled there.\nThe expressway would have bisected residential areas like Henrietta, Benton and Asbury streets.\nA City Council vote halted the project in 1973, but its proponents made another attempt to bring it to fruition in 1975. Longtime resident Ed Simmons said the state Department of Transportation bought up Swillburg homes to make way for the project. A number of property owners let their roofs and porches sag, expecting their houses to be taken soon by eminent domain, he said.\n\"They tore down a large number of houses,\" said Simmons, whose family ran the now-closed Simmons Hardware store on South Clinton Avenue.\nThe battle over the project came to a head at a raucous City Council meeting at East High School in September 1975, where more than 1,000 people packed the auditorium. The crowd \"sneered and jeered like fans watching a hockey fight,\" according to a Democrat and Chronicle story.\nThe shaded area shows the planned path of the Genesee Expressway, a 1970s-era highway project in Rochester's Swillburg neighborhood. (Photo: Rochester Times-Union)\nDespite being courted by expressway supporters, too, City Council voted against the project, 6-3, according to a separate news story.\nLuke Parisi, who was a city councilman at the time and voted against the expressway, recalled taking a lot of heat from both sides.\n\"I look back in retrospect and it really was quite an event,\" he said. \"The community was very, very interested — I wouldn't say organized, but vocal and very logical in their approach.\"\nJudy Hay, former pastor at Calvary St. Andrew's Presbyterian Parish and a neighborhood activist, said it's important to remember that citizens spoke up then and still can do so today.\n\"That was a collective voice that I think was unique in Rochester history, which made a significant difference in the defeat of the expressway, to everyone in the neighborhood's delight,\" she said.\nSwillburg has since blossomed, Hay said. It remembers its history — Otto Henderberg Park off Field Street memorializes a resident who spearheaded opposition to the expressway.\nNeighbors will celebrate the anniversary of the highway's defeat on from 6 to 7:30 p.m. Thursday at Artisan Church, 1235 S. Clinton Ave. Tickets are $20 at the door and include dinner.\nDRILEY@Gannett.com", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDgic3J3xWc", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/543e63b3ee1945b360cec54015613a7ac8610413/r=279x400/local/-/media/2015/10/07/Rochester/Rochester/635798218938343356-Expressway-2.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/07/Rochester/Rochester/635798218938343356-Expressway-2.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9f5b661a6aa1e178f6871b838a79e970a2388e9e/c=0-18-365-505&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/10/07/Rochester/Rochester/635798218938343356-Expressway-2.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/pDgic3J3xWc"], "published": "2015-10-08T04:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:07:23.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
