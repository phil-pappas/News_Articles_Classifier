Resurrected in the same space as the legendary rooftop bar from the 1980s and 1990s and borrowing the name, Hattie’s is now a stylish sushi lounge. When we arrived for our reservation on the ninth floor of the hotel, (a Doubletree by Hilton) our table was not ready, so we lingered at the bar to enjoy one of their signature mixed drinks. Strenuously squinting to see the menu due to extremely low lighting, we scanned their selection of wines, sakes, and cocktails. We tried the Woke Up In Tokyo ($12), which is served in a rocks glass. The botanical blend of Plymouth gin, house-made green tea syrup, orange bitters and sparkling sake poured over one large ice cube was cool and harmonious.\nA grand ceiling and windows worthy of the picturesque view punctuate the space. A recessed bar allows for all to look out across the balcony that wraps around the entire floor of the building. Despite the dusk and chill in the air, we couldn’t help but grab our drinks and venture outside to take in the sights. On the other side of the building, flames emanating from a fire pit were perfect to warm us up on these crisp fall nights.\nWhen our table was ready, we followed the host to one of the five tables. An eager server refilled our beverages. I continued with one of their three sakes by the glass ($8), a chilled, slightly sweet variety served in a champagne glass. My companion opted for a pint of Japanese beer on draft ($6).\nThe menu is organized by otsumami (snacks), sakana (small plates), special sashimi (raw fish and meat), individual sashimi, nigiri or maki; chef’s choice sushi; and rolls. After believing we knew what to try, to our disappointment we were informed that two of our five choices were not available. Looking to our server for advice, he insisted that the Berkshire Pork Belly Steamed Buns ($12) were “to die for.” How could we resist.\nAll of our food arrived at once after a remarkably extended wait. Beginning with the Oyster Shooter ($6), a towering shot glass was colorfully filled with diced apple, caviar, quail egg yolk, fresno chili pepper (the pepper in Sriracha) and shochu, a strong Japanese alcohol. Our well-versed server said that the evening’s oysters were from Massachusetts. The shooter was my least favorite choice of the night. While my companion swigged it back like it was nothing, I wanted to appreciate all of the ingredients separately. The tiny raw oyster was effectively sea-fresh, but the alcohol overpowered the remaining lavish ingredients.\nDiving into the highly anticipated steamed buns we immediately noticed that the forgiving buns were not warm. Folded inside were slices of 24-hour brined pork belly cooked slowly for eight hours until tender but intact. Tart pineapple, textural crushed peanuts, gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste) and green onion marked a pleasing amalgam of Asian flavors.\nThe Sashimi Plate ($30) and Chirashi Bowl ($25) were our favorites of the visit and showcased Hattie’s true character as a sushi bar with consistently delivered seafood and seasonal ingredients.\nChef’s choice of thinly sliced fish was elegantly placed on an oblong platter composing the sashimi plate. Raw, slim pieces of watermelon-red yellowfin tuna (maguro), translucent amberjack (kanpachi) garnished with scallions and buttery-soft salmon (sake) each effortlessly melted on my palate. Sturdy and slightly chewy slices of cooked octopus (tako), milky white flesh and purple outline, also occupied the plate. A pair of eel (unagi) was the night’s standout. A sweet and thick tare glaze bursting with umami balanced the intense smokiness of the eel that had been warmed with a torch.\nA similar composition to the sashimi plate, the Chirashi Bowl held most of the same fish plus cooked opaque shrimp, thinly shredded carrots and pickled red onion over sushi rice with black sesame seeds. The addition of the soured onion brought the ingredients to life. The supplemental rice lacked flavor and was best left alone.\nHattie’s is a stop worth taking if you’re looking for an unrivaled Rochester horizon view, unique drink options and approachable bar food that won’t weigh you down on your ride back to the first floor.\nFreelance writer Amanda Antinore reviews restaurants based on a one-time visit.\nHATTIE’S RESTAURANT\nLocation: 550 East Ave., Rochester; (585) 461-5010; strathallan.com/hatties-restaurant\nHours: 4 p.m. to midnight Monday–Thursday; 4 p.m. to 2 a.m. Friday–Saturday; 4 to 11 p.m. Sunday.\nAppetizers: $3–$10.\nEntrées: $4–$50.\nDiet: Vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free items on menu.\nHandicapped-accessible: Yes; wheelchair friendly.\nReservations: Yes; recommended.\nKid-friendly: No.\nAttire: Business casual.\nCredit cards accepted: Yes.\nParking: Free in lot adjacent to the hotel; limited free on-street parking; valet available.", "external_links": ["http://www.strathallan.com/hatties-restaurant"], "published": "2015-10-21T06:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:23:58.526+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
