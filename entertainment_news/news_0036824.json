For many years, he worked with youth as a Boy Scout leader and advisor, earning the Lamb Award for his service to both scouting and the church. Even though he was never a Boy Scout, as a young man, he guided many to obtain the rank of Eagle Scout. A source of great pride was that his son, son-in-law, and grandson are all Eagle Scouts. \nA versatile athlete, Alex was a passionate runner, participating in many small races and 13 marathons. He enjoyed running with his friends, a close knit group called \"The Gang\", whom he considered to be his extended family. He also took great pleasure playing tennis, volleyball, and cards. \nFor many years, Alex was a regular at Beaver Bobcat Football games and Midland Leopard Basketball games. He was a loyal Pittsburgh Steeler fan, faithfully wearing the black and gold until the end. \nA memorial service for family and friends will be conducted on Friday, October 23, 2015, at 10 a.m. in the NOLL FUNERAL HOME INC., 333 Third St., Beaver.
