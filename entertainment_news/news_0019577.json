Extra gum plays a role in unwrapping their story and bringing them together. \nA cover of \"Can't Help Falling in Love\" by \"American Idol\" contestant Haley Reinhart plays in the background. \nAccording to an article by Billboard, Ole Media Management, the company Reinhart is signed with, was pitching her songs to Energy BBDO, the advertising agency behind the Wrigley's campaign. Energy BBDO's music team manager, Daniel Kuypers, was instructed to pick a song for the commercial that would make consumers cry. He chose Reinhart's cover. Ole's senior director of creative licensing, Randall Foster, saw the mock of the commercial and did just that. \n\"My eyes welled up,” Foster told Billboard. \"If a grown man watches a commercial and it drives me to tears, I knew it would connect.\" \nThe video has been viewed more than 9 million times on YouTube.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:42:21.929+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
