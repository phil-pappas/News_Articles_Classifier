He is the first Jamaican writer to take the prestigious award.\nThe chairman of the judges, Michael Wood, said James' \"A Brief History of Seven Killings\" was full of the \"sheer pleasure\" of language.\nJames, 44, was awarded the 50,000 pound ($77,000) prize during a black-tie dinner at London's medieval Guildhall. Critics have compared his novel to the work of William Faulkner and Quentin Tarantino, while James himself has cited Charles Dickens as an influence.\nJames beat five other authors, including Americans Anne Tyler, for multigenerational family saga \"A Spool of Blue Thread,\" and Hanya Yanagihara for \"A Little Life,\" the story of four friends.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
