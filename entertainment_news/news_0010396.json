They are just getting to know each other and taking things slowly, but Joey is already smitten. \n“Perrie has just come out of a serious relationship and is enjoying having fun right now.” \nSince splitting from Zayn Malik in August , Perrie’s been keeping busy, thanks to a packed promo schedule for Little Mix’s upcoming album, ‘Get Weird’. \nIt hasn’t all been smooth-sailing though and one of their live performances was briefly halted in late August, when Perrie broke down in tears . \nJoey Essex \nJust days before the incident, Perrie addressed the break-up during an appearance on James Corden’s US talk show , telling the host: ““You know what? I’m good. \n“We’re having an absolute blast in America. Things are going so well and I just wake up every day and I thank my lucky stars I have these three girls.” \nMeanwhile, Joey split from his latest girlfriend just weeks ago.
