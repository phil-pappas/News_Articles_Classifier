In addition, they have been recognized as the 5th best pool company in America when it comes to \"Customer Service\", the third straight year being in the Top 5 in this category.\nThis is the fourth year that the Pool & Spa News Top 50 Builders have been selected using new, better-rounded criteria, and the competition has become fierce ( http://www.poolspanews.com/award-winners/introducing-the-2015-top-50- ... pzone=home ). The group has become more diverse in the last four years, due to judging that now considers staffing practices, networking, community service, industry involvement, web presence, as well as residential construction revenue.

Georgia Classic Pool is proud to be ranked among the nation's best and believe it is a testament to the value of their brand and the loyalty and trust they have been able to cultivate with their customers. \"We are so appreciative to have such an amazing compliment of folks associated with our company that has a common goal of exceeding our customers' expectations,\" said Vance Dover, Owner. \"Moving beyond Customer Satisfaction to Customer Delight and having them so thankful for selecting us to makes it all worthwhile in the end.\"\nGeorgia Classic Pool is ranked #5 in America in what it considers the most prestigious category, that being Customer Service. 2015 is the third straight year they have been ranked in the Top 5. Those with the highest scores in customer service seem to have a few things in common: exceptional communication, rigorous follow-up on any problems, and insistence on keeping all promises made to a homeowner. It is no wonder that over 50% of their business comes from direct referral of past happy customers.\n\"One of the biggest things we do and this probably sounds cliched is really over communicate. We try to make sure the customer is aware of all the steps going through the process. We get excited about the jobs. My brother Joe and I aren't just salesmen, we also manage the jobs and are both out almost every day. We're probably as excited as the homeowner about how a project ends up. We try to treat every job as if it was our own pool, and we'll tell people that.\" - Vance Dover\nGeorgia Classic Pool also has a very strong web presence and it was rewarded as the 3rd best in the country.
