She beat the odds and it was no accident. Born and raised in Nigeria , she was abandoned by her father when she was only eight years old and then by her mother. After being taken in by relatives, she left Africa when she was 15, expecting to live with her father. Instead she found herself unwanted and living in a cousin's dark and cold basement in Chicago , resolving to triumph over the mean circumstances life had handed her.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151002/273638\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151002/273639\nIn her new memoir, Courage to Persevere: A Compelling Story of Struggle, Survival and Triumph , due out in November , available on Amazon.com, Gilbert explains what drove her to work up to three jobs at the same time to put herself through college. She eventually earned a master's of science in nursing and an MBA and went on to have the loving family she lacked as a child. Her story can help other people overcome the seemingly insurmountable obstacles in their own lives.\nGilbert can explain:\nHow to adopt her strategy of not taking no for an answer. How she coped with the institutional racism she experienced in her early nursing career. What she learned from surviving being bullied as both a child ... and adult. What to do if you feel your employment situation is poor. Why she now thinks that \"anything is possible, if you believe.\" ABOUT THE AUTHOR\nTami Gilbert went on to earn her MSN and MBA degrees because she realized that education was the way out of her struggles. She is married and the mother of three children. In addition to being an author she is a safety expert who specializes in decreasing workplace injuries, an OSHA trainer and a motivational speaker.
