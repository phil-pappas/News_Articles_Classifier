Now on clean slate after his breakup with Maja Salvador, is Gerald Anderson ready to say “I love you” again?\nWell, not romantically. In an interview, the 26-year-old actor said he is happy and content saying those three words to family members.\nGerald Anderson\n“Kasama na diyan siyempre mga kasama ko (sa trabaho), mga kaibigan ko. Love life, wala pa, (pero) darating din ’yun…”\nThe “Nathaniel” star hopes if and when romantic love comes anew, he will be mature enough to better handle it.\n“Kung ano man ’yung mga nagawa kong mali (at) kung ano man ’yung mga nagawa nilang mali, we just learn from that,” he said of his past relationships.\nGerald and Maja remain civil with one another post breakup. Asked if he is supporting her upcoming major concert, “MAJAsty,” the actor said, “Why not? S’yempre kung in-invite ako, isasama ko (pa) ’yung buong friends ko (and) family ko.”\nPerhaps Gerald can count on Maja to return the favor. He stars in the Star Cinema film “Everyday I Love You” along with the hot tandem of Liza Soberano and Enrique Gil together known as LizQuen. The movie opens Oct. 28.\nIn the film, Gerald plays Tristan, the boyfriend of Audrey (Liza). Their relationship is rocked with the arrival of Ethan (Enrique).\nGerald deems playing the character a challenge, especially when he falls into a coma. “Dahil energetic ako at may ADHD pa ’ko, ang hirap na nakahiga lang ako the whole scene,” he said.\nHe is confident LizQuen fans will support the movie as “mababait ang fans ng LizQuen.”\n“Na-meet ko sila sa Laguna,” Gerald said. “I think at the end of the day sobrang supportive lang ang lahat, so we want to give them a good project.”\nWhat if some of them start bashing him?\nGerald retorted, “Wala po tayong magagawa, it’s part of life.”\nA DECADE OF SUCCESS\nIt’s been 10 years since Gerald first gained notice via the ABS-CBN reality TV show “Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition.”\nHe has since carved a successful acting career that enabled him to give his family a comfortable life. “Kung mamahalin mo ’yung trabaho mo, mamahalin ka rin ng trabaho mo,” he said.\nThese days, however, he is more conscious of the roles he does. “Ngayon kasi ang question na pumapasok parati sa isip ko ’pag may offer is, ‘Will I be better after this project or will this just be a project na pagsisisihan ko?’ Gusto ko na ngayon ibang (roles), ’yung macha-challenge naman ako.”\nHe added, “Pwede akong maging support, kahit maging passerby lang, pero ang importante po (ay) kung gaano siya kaimportante sa istorya, kung interesting ba siya.”\nThe 2013 Golden Screen Awards Best Actor maintained that being able to support his family is paramount to him.\n“Nu’ng nag-showbiz ako nagbago po ang buhay ko. Ang dami pong opportunities at mga pangarap na dumating. Kaya nagtatrabaho ako, so there will never be a day na magugutom ang pamilya ko,” he said. (With report from Jojo P.
