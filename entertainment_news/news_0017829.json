(Photo: DC) Chennai : A day after his defeat at the recently concluded Nadigar Sangam elections, actor/politician Sarath Kumar, the former president of the association who lost to actor Nasser, revealed that he has cancelled the agreement with SPI Cinemas on September 29 which was the bone of contention for SIAA’s split.\nAt a hurriedly convened press conference, Sarath Kumar who was in an emotional mood said, “I have worked for Nadigar Sangam tirelessly for the last 15 years. I have helped so many members in many ways when they were in need. All along I have worked with all fairness.”\nHe said he will furnish financial audited accounts and details of Sangam activities for the last 15 years to the newly elected president Nasser. “I have already sent the election accounts to Nasser.”\nSarath said that he did not understand why Vishal team found fault with the agreement with SPI Cinemas, which is the best and beneficial for Sangam .\n“Go through the veracity of the agreement with SPI for Nadigar Sangam building and if found genuine, reconsider the same,” he requested Nasser and Vishal. “I am here in the industry for 33 years and have a ‘clean image’. I was very deeply hurt by various accusations and allegation made on me. Hence, I discussed with SPI Cinemas a week prior to cancellation of the agreement (on Sep 29) and realising my plight they came forward to nullify it,” Sarath said.\n“Had I informed about canceling of agreement with SPI Cinemas earlier, Pandavar Ani would have claimed it as their first success. I thought I would announce this after we win the elections to clear my bad name and image”, he stated.\nSarath said he would remain an active member of Nadigar Sangam and would be ready to help if need arises. “I have not committed any mistake. I hope the baseless accusations on me would stop at least now,” Sarath said, tears welling up in his eyes.\n entertainment Kollywood Nadigar Sangam elections Nasser Also Read Ravi Teja back on May 22 A show that has you ‘webbed’ Gauri Khan helping Deepika Padukone furnish her home?
