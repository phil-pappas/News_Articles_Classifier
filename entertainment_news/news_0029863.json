You couldn't get away with just focusing on a woman's size these days, but it seems to be all right to do that (to a man). It makes me a bit cross sometimes.\"\n\"So when I go out, I am particularly recognisable, I think. The only person I hang out with who is more recognisable is Matt Lucas, who is recognisable from 100 yards away. And he gets it constantly... people taking photos or double-taking.\"\nWhile he does get recognised thanks to his Office character, he said: \"Gareth was an odd-looking bloke, with the hair... so therefore people will always think of me as a pale, unhealthy, pasty-looking weirdo.\nShare article \"And people also hear a West Country accent when I'm talking, when there isn't one. I am from Kent. My accent is Kentish.\"\nThe latest in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, Dead Men Tell No Tales, is due out in 2017.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-20T16:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:24:19.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
