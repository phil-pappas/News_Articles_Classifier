In August, he and two other Americans were hailed as heroes for stopping a terrorist attack on a Paris-bound train.\nHe said even the train experience \"made more sense\" than the Oregon shootings.\nSkarlatos said he would have been enrolled at Umpqua Community College this semester, but changed his plans to appear on \"Dancing with the Stars.\"", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-06T05:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:13:05.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
