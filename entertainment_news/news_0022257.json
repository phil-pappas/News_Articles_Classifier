(Photo: Submitted photo) \nNot only will Indian and Arabic music mix with jazz and funk at the baby grand (818 N. Market St., Wilmington) Saturday, but a Wilmington musician will be getting a much-needed lift. \nScott Davidson and his trio will team up with Indian classical musicians Snehasish Mozumder (mandolin) and Rajendra Das (tabla) for a night of music billed as an “East meets West Fusion concert.” \nDavidson, a percussionist, plays with Roger Mgrdichian (oud) and Lloyd Shorter (oboe, English horn) in his trio. \nThe 8 p.m. show is more than a melding of music from around the world for Davidson, who is suffering from kidney failure and is in need of a kidney transplant. Proceeds from the show will go to his transplant fund. \nTickets are $24 at the box office, by calling 652-5577 or going to thegrandwilmington.org . \nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.
