But she's hoping you're ready to pay attention.\nThe singer's new single and video, \"Magic & Makeup,\" was just released and includes a quick nod to her DC days. Watch for a flash of a photo featuring BeyoncÃ©, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams at the :45 second mark.\nFranklin joined the group in early 2000 along with Williams, replacing LeToya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson. Franklin was out of the group five months later, leading to endless speculation about what happened. DC3 continued, of course, and became one of the most successful girl groups of all time.\nFranklin recently took to her Instagram to address rumors that she's writing a tell-all about her famous ex-bandmate: \"We do not need the BS or lies from a gossip site to take away the message of empowerment, self love and spreading love!! Ms. Franklin's new single titled #magicandmakeup is going viral because its a hit record, we do not need an urban blogger creating a buzz for themselves; from our success with this hit single, while we are continuing to build Farrah Franklin's brand!! Nor do we need their pathetic attempts and lies to promote her talents or create drama because they chose to make a living from hate and belittling others! Ms. Franklin has not and does not plan on doing anything but spreading love and creating more magic with her music! Nice try but not today \"\n\"Magic & Makeup\" is Franklin's first formal single but does little to distinguish itself from so many R&B ballads. The video currently has about 9,500 views.", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/21/72/24/4695334/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/21/72/24/4695322/5/920x920.jpg",
