The \" Grace and Frankie \" actress gave birth to the bundle of joy on Wednesday, September 30 in Austin, Texas, Us Weekly learns. It's her first child with the tennis player. The couple tied the knot in 2009 after a year of engagement. \"He's just the most clever person I've ever met,\" she gushed over her hubby to Glamour last year. \"He has such a quick mind ... He's so clever, and his humor is very snarky. It always makes me laugh.\" They announced they're expecting a baby in May. \"My only weird craving-it's not even weird-is orange juice. I've never really enjoyed orange juice but it's my one craving,\" so she said back then. Neither of them has, however, said a word about the baby arrival. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T10:01:46.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
