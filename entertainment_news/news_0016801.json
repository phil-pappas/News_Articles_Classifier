It's understood that the third film will not be based on the latest Bridget Jones novel, Mad About The Boy, but will instead be based on the short stories and columns written by Helen Fielding.\nThe latest novel sees (spoilers, obviously) Jones, now a mother to two children, getting back into the dating game following the death of her husband, Mark D'Arcy. The novel sees Jones having a toyboy romance with a much younger man called Roxster. Although he's not yet officially confirmed, it's widely believed that Colin Firth will be returning in the role.\nBridget is back!
