That is £6.15 million a month or £202,014 a day.\nThey did have to pay more than £28 million in administrative expenses - hiring all those guards to keep them safe from the legion of fans doesn't come cheap - meaning the lads will have to make do with £45.3 million profit before tax, or £35 million after tax.\nRemarkably, that is almost 10 times the amount they brought in during 2013 (£4.8 million).\nWhile Zayn Malik left the group he will still be entitled to a chunk of this cash, having only left the band in March last year.\nThe four remaining members - Harry Styles, Liam Payne, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson - are celebrating another success: the release of their new single, Perfect.\nThe single has already rocketed to the top of iTunes, and it appears to have gone down well with fans, who are sharing their excitement on social media.\nThe hash tag 'It'sPerfectDay' trended worldwide within minutes of the song's release.\nTalking to Good Morning Britain recently, Tomlinson said they are \"counting down the shows\" as they approach the final \"emotional\" concert of their current tour - and joked that they may take up a hobby like pottery during their time out from the band.\nHe said the quartet will still spend time together and have plans to go on a \"lads holiday\".\nThe band revealed in August that they are set to take a short break next year.\nAsked how long the break will be, Tomlinson said: \"We don't really want to put a time on it because then that puts pressure on us and we're just going to enjoy this time to do what we want to do.\"\nShare article Meanwhile, commenting on Malik's departure from the band, Payne said Malik is \"off doing what he loves\", adding: \"Both parties are winners in the end of a disaster of a situation, so it's all good.\"\nTheir fifth studio album is due for release on Friday November 13.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-16T18:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:16:58.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
