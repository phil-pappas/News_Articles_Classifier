When I’m working for a show, I become conflicted. The person I like and the female lead of the show pose a psychological tug-of-war in my head,” Joo Won explained. \n“I like the movie ‘Notebook.’ It’s the kind of authentic melodrama I want to act in. A love where both sides are helplessly infatuated,” the actor said. ADVERTISEMENT \nHis ideal woman is one who has “a pretty backline and a pot belly with big heart.” If he falls in love he would commit a hundred percent, “When I fall in love I stay in love. I think true affection comes from never thinking about leaving each other,” he said. \nIn this episode of “Healing Camp,” Joo won sang a verse from musical “Don Quixote,” showing off his musical skills. \nRELATED STORIES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:41:15.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
