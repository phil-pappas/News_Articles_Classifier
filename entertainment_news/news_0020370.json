The jet “returning to the base from an interdicted mission crashed due to bad weather and not under enemy fire around Hong, Adamawa State at about 1623hrs (1523 GMT). There was no survival as the pilot of the aircraft lost his life in the unfortunate incident,” the statement said yesterday. \nThe statement neither said how many passengers were aboard the jet nor its precise mission in Adamawa, one of the three states in the region where Boko Haram militants have launched deadly attacks that have killed hundreds over its six-year insurgency. The Air Force authorities are investigating the cause of the crash, the statement added. \nModified Date: October 11, 2015 5:46 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:11:17.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
