(Photo: John Salangsang/Invision/AP)\n2 CONNECT 50 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Bobby Brown is not even close to getting over the trauma of the still-mysterious death of his daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown, but writing his \"raw and unvarnished\" memoir has been therapeutic for the R&B singer.\nDey Street Books, an imprint of HarperCollins, announced Tuesday that My Prerogative — a title taken from one of his songs — will be published in June 2016.\nThe book deal was arranged before Bobbi Kristina, Brown's only child with his ex-wife, the late Whitney Houston, was found unresponsive in her bathtub in Roswell, Ga., in January. She died July 26 without ever regaining consciousness; she was 22.\nHer death is still unresolved: The local medical examiner has determined a cause of death but has not yet released it publicly. Meanwhile, suspicion has fallen on her boyfriend and housemate, Nick Gordon, who has been under investigation by Fulton County police and prosecutors. He's also been accused in a civil lawsuit by her conservator of having a hand in her death by allegedly injecting her with a toxic substance.\nUSA TODAY\nBobbi Kristina Brown has died\nIn a statement issued by Dey Street Books, Brown, 46, said he hoped his fans would be entertained by his memoir's look at his \"crazy, exciting, fascinating world.\"\n\"Right after I signed on to write my story, I went through one of the most agonizing traumas I had ever experienced with the death of my daughter,\" Brown said. \"But I was surprised by how therapeutic it was to work on this project, to look at the entire arc of my life and to realize that although there has been considerable pain, I have also been incredibly blessed.\"\nHe said he hoped \"my fans and other readers of this book ... will feel that I have been as honest and open with them in these pages as I have tried to be my entire life.\"\nDey Street promised Brown will tell his side of the story of his fractious, and closely watched, relationship with Houston, who died in 2012 after she was found dead in a bathtub in a Beverly Hills hotel.\nDey Street described My Prerogative as the story of a man \"who has been on the top of the mountain and in the depths of the valley\" and who is now finally ready to talk about it all. Denise Oswald, senior editor of Dey Street, said Brown's life has been \"truly extraordinary.\"\n\"His music, both with New Edition and in his incredible solo career, defined an era, but his life — full of epic highs, wild romance, and crushing lows— has been the subject of endless speculation and debate,\" Oswald said in a statement.\n\"We’re thrilled to be working with him as he opens up as never before about everything from his early days in the Boston projects, to his love affair with Whitney, to the heart-breaking death of his daughter, Bobbi Kristina, in what we know will be one of the most talked-about books of the season.”\nFinancial terms for My Prerogative were not disclosed.\nBrown was famous and successful even before he met Houston but his 1992-2007 marriage to the diva was tumultuous in part due to his problems with drugs and alcoholism.\nThe memoir will be co-written by Nick Chiles, who has worked on books by the Rev. Al Sharpton and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, among others.\nBrown has said little publicly about Bobbi Kristina's tragedy, either during the months she was in a coma or after her death, funeral and burial (next to her mother in a New Jersey cemetery). Nor has he commented on Gordon, with whom he has a fraught relationship.\nUSA TODAY\nBobby Brown speaks about his lost Bobbi Kristina\nBrown has done only one TV interview, last month, when he and his wife, Alicia Etheredge Brown, appeared on The Real , a syndicated daytime talk show. He told the hosts he never gave up hope that Bobbi Kristina would recover but eventually yielded to God's will.\nChristopher Brown, one of Brown's lawyers, did not return an email seeking comment.\nContributing: The Associated Press\n2 CONNECT 50 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1RF2WeR TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RF2WeR&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/020e18256f4a5fb614fd9d4c3c64bf8e27562930/c=269-0-1535-1266/local/-/media/2015/02/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/635584244405338162-BOBBI-AND-MOM.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635803337173329429-AP-Books-Bobby-Brown.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/50117b4bfe181f32492ec4d414638d7c08e560e6/r=500x400/local/-/media/2015/10/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635803337173329429-AP-Books-Bobby-Brown.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1RF2WeR", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d4f7a776c92cfc181205a5d4386a1d745948c457/c=0-377-7359-4534&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/09/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/635775969376738988--PRO1197.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RF2WeR&text=Bobby%20Brown%3A%20Writing%20%27unvarnished%27%20memoir%20was%20cathartic&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cc6cf6a8de59b0f3c2ab5dbd76ca1a131d6efd27/c=0-53-2000-1557&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635803337173329429-AP-Books-Bobby-Brown.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-13T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:45:28.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
