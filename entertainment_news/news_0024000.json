The UFC Women's Bantamweight Champion revealed to Cosmopolitan that Justin Bieber rudely snubbed her little sister when she asked for a picture at the Cannes Film Festival in May. \"Justin Bieber was actually really rude to my little sister,\" she said. \"He was taking some pictures with some ladies and she suddenly got really excited and was like, 'Do you think he'd want to take a picture with me?' I was like, 'Sure Julie ... Look at him, he's a sweetheart.' \" \"I walked over there and said, 'Excuse me,' he turned and goes, 'I've already taken a billion pictures today, OK.' I said, 'Yeah but',\" she recalled. \"I only got, 'Yeah but' out before he goes, 'A billion' and walks off and totally snubs my little sister.\" The MMA fighter continued, \"Julie looks at me and she's on the verge of tears and she goes, 'I'm no longer a Belieber.' Yeah I don't think I'd want to hang out with him. I'm not a Belieber. I was, but I'm not anymore.\" In a separate interview during her visit to \" The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon \", Ronda Rousey talked about her feud with Floyd Mayweather, Jr. who's coicidentally Bieber's close friend. \"I said ... something to the effect that now he knows how it feels to have a woman beat him for once,\" she said, making a sly reference to the domestic violence allegations against Mayweather. In response to the boxer's diss about his not knowing who she was, Rousey replied, \"If I ever run into him, every time that I run into him I'm going to reintroduce myself. Maybe one day he'll actually remember me.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T18:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:33:54.266+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
