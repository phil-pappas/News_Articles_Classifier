(PRWEB) October 12, 2015\nTerrorist organizations in the Middle East, the most powerful one today being ISIS, have used religion as way to justify violent behavior. According to Chatha Akbar Ghulam, who wrote “Faith, Not Religions”, their radical behavior stems from Islam.\nAkbar, born a Muslim from Pakistan, is in opposition of all religious dogmas because they cause conflict. Only after Akbar’s whole family immigrated to the United States did he feel safe enough to publicize “Faith, Not Religions”. He believes that he and his family might have faced dire consequences for espousing the religious beliefs in this book in an Islamic regime, an outcome that only drives him further into the arms of questions that practitioners of all faiths should be willing to ask.\n“It is very clearly written in the Holy Book. One who converts from Islam to any other religion or no religion must be killed,” Ghulam said.\nHe does not believe in the concept of the organized religion, but he does believe in having faith in God. Faith, unlike religion is fully flexible so one can rethink, discuss, and reconsider the concepts to prove its reliability.\n“My book covers nearly all aspects of human life; if anything is left unexplained I believe I can explain to the satisfaction of humanity,” Ghulam said.\nBy reading “Faith, Not Religions” readers will learn that a loving heart is the only requirement needed to have faith in God. They will also receive a first hand account of living in a nation where their only way to survive is to conform to the traditional customs or flee.\n“Faith, Not Religions”\nBy Chatha Akbar Ghulam\nISBN 978-1-4759-6460-8\nAvailable in softcover, hardcover, and e-book\nAvailable online at Amazon, Barnes & Noble and iUniverse\nAbout the author\nChatha Akbar Ghulam was born in Punjab, Pakistan. He is a farmer by profession and a Muslim by birth. He currently lives in the USA.\n# # #\n**For Immediate Release**\nFor review copies or interview requests, contact:\nCraig Cainkar\n317.602.7137\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13013231.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13013231.htm"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:08:34.581+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
