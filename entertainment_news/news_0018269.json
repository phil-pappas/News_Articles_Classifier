The truth is, the term \"pit bull\" actually encompasses multiple breeds and mixes. \"The general term 'pit bull' refers to a number of terrier or retriever breed mixes and includes dogs who have a muscular build and square face,\" says Rebecca Lohnes, Behavior and Training Manager at Lollypop Farm, the Humane Society of Greater Rochester.\nLohnes says that many dogs assumed to be pit bulls fall into the bully breed category. These purebreds include American pit bull terriers, Staffordshire bull terriers, American Staffordshire terriers, American bulldogs and bull terriers, among others. \"Most of the dogs who people might call a \"pit bull\" that find themselves at Lollypop Farm are actually bully breed mixes.\"\nAccording to Lohnes, all adoptable dogs at Lollypop Farm receive physical and behavioral evaluations. Adoptions counselors also obtain information from the previous owner about the dog's history. So a bully breed mix who is available for adoption poses no more of a threat to people or other animals than any other dog up for adoption.\nAs with most shelter dogs, says Lohnes, many bully breed mixes find themselves at Lollypop Farm through no fault of their own. Their owners may simply not be able to care for them due to personal or financial reasons.\nRecently, a dog named Marilyn Monroe waited at Lollypop Farm nearly three months to find a home. Lohnes describes her as \"a sweet dog who socializes well with people and other animals,\" but she may have been passed over by potential adopters simply because she was a bully breed mix. Her new owners, says Lohnes, couldn't believe she hadn't been adopted sooner and felt lucky to find her.\nLohnes says that Lollypop Farm has placed many bully breed mixes in homes, and the owners have been delighted. She says that owners have checked in with updates, calling their dogs \"friendly,\" \"smart,\" \"obedient\" and \"loyal.\"\nAnd because they're so trainable, these dogs excel in dog sports and activities such as flyball, agility, weight pull and even tracking/search and rescue.\n\"All dogs are individuals, and animals are products of their environments,\" Lohnes explains. \"We need to change the conversation about bully breed mixes and choose to train, rehabilitate and love them. People shouldn't reject a potential loving and loyal companion just because of a bad — and false — reputation.\"\nThis story is provided and presented by our sponsor, Lollypop Farm, Humane Society of Greater Rochester", "external_links": ["http://www.lollypop.org/"], "published": "2015-10-07T22:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:11:40.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
