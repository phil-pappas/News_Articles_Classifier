Rolling!' and they just whipped this tarp off of us. And we'd be like, 'All right. Back in it! Let's go!'\" \nBomer said Gaga invited him over her house before they started filming, so that creating the sex scene wouldn't be awkward. In fact, it was pretty easy working with the pop star, he said. \n\"Stephanie -- which is what I call her because it makes me let go of the whole mythos of Lady Gaga, who I'm a huge fan of and just relate to her as an actress -- is so intelligent and gracious and down-to-earth,\" Bomer said. \nAmerican Horror Story: Hotel airs on FX Wednesday at 10 p.m. Eastern. \nCopyright Â© 2015,  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:36:03.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
