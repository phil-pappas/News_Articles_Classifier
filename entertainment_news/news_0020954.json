No other persons were reported to be injured, they said. At this stage police believe a number of offences may have been committed. \n“There have been 20 arrests – the majority of which have been for affray,” it added. ”The point of the protest today was to raise awareness and show the Indian authorities that Sikhs of the UK stand in solidarity with the community in the Punjab who are suffering at the hands of Indian authorities,” said Jasveer Singh Gill, a spokesperson of the Sikh PA who was present at the spot. \nCommercial and educational establishments were affected and transport services disrupted in parts of Punjab last week in response to a bandh called by Sikh outfits against the killing of two youths and police action during protests over alleged desecration of their holy book. \n  6:51 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:11:47.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
