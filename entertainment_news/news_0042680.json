Amit Kapoor, who is producing the movie in association with Raju Chadha and Vikram Khakhar, says, \"We needed a retro track that instantly transported you to the 80s. The song had to be high on melody and something that would make you groove instantly. It was necessary that the number personified the flamboyance and magic of Charles' character. ' Jab Chhaye Mera Jadoo' fit the bill and it has been my personal favourite, too.\"\nREAD: Randeep Hooda charms foreign co-actors in 'Main Aur Charles'\nFor Kanika, it was a challenge to record a song that has been a rage. She says, \"It wasn't that we had to remix an old song for the modern day. The film is based in the 70s and 80s, so we had to make sure that the song's retro vibe was retained. At the same time, it had to be contemporary for today's listeners. I was also thrilled to feature in a movie for the first time and I'm thankful to the composers Sanjeev-Darshan and the film's team.\" Main Aur Charles, presented by Wave Cinemas Ponty Chadha and produced by Cynozure Networkz, releases October 30.\nFor latest Bollywood updates, follow us on Twitter >>> @TOIEntertain\nFor the latest in Bollywood news, like us on Facebook >>> TOIEntertain\nFor more interesting Bollywood news and pictures, follow us on Pinterest>>> timesofindia\nFor latest Bollywood updates, follow us on G+ >>> The Times of India Entertainment\nClick here for more Bollywood videos\nWATCH: Jab Chaye Tera Jadoo - Main Aur Charles", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/pLYDs7utaDQ", "https://www.pinterest.com/timesofindia/", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107628521107103264647/+TOIEntertainment/posts", "https://twitter.com/TOIEntertain", "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzjPDNc5ZgsCeE3cQedGQG8kA_B6yPM9x"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T15:38:01.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
