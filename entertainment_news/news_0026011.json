Blazevic said he could not give any other details about the shoot. \nThe request seems simple enough but finding the ideal location has been challenging, Blazevic told DNAinfo New York. \nThe ideal spot, he said, would be a living room that’s about 30-by-35-feet in an apartment on the first or second floor, which would make it easier for crews to load and unload equipment. The apartment must also be in the vicinity of the street signs since filmmakers plan to shoot other scenes in the area that day, Blazevic added. \nAnd because the show is set in the 1970s, the living room cannot have been recently remodeled, according to the flier. \nMany people have called him since he posted the flier, Blazevic said, but all their apartments were located on higher floors. \n“This is really difficult to find,” he said. \n“Vinyl” has been filming in various locations in the city since May, according to the flier. \nSet in a time “when punk, disco and [a] new form of music called hip-hop collided,” the series follows a record executive named Richie, played by Bobby Cannavale, the flier said. The show also stars Olivia Wilde, Ray Romano and Juno Temple. \n“Vinyl” is expected to premiere next year, according to its website.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:02:49.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
