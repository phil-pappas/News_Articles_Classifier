Hours worked also fell, labor force participation declined, and wage growth stagnated.\"\nYuck.\nHere are three important takeaways from the dismal jobs report.\n1. Global spillover\nSeveral important sectors fell back sharply in September, suggesting that the global economic slowdown is spilling over into the U.S. economy. At minimum, the global turmoil is \"causing businesses to turn more cautious in their hiring,\" said Zandi.\nThe financial sector, which holds an important place in the economy, was flat. The construction sector, in the final months before the winter slowdown, added a lackluster 8,000 jobs. And the labor-intensive manufacturing sector, socked on the chin by the strong U.S. dollar, shed 9,000 posts in September. A stronger dollar makes U.S. goods more expensive abroad.\n\"Since January ... the manufacturing sector has netted zero net new jobs, with 27,000 workers lost in just the past two months,\" noted Chad Moutray, chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers. \"In the second half of 2014, manufacturers were hiring at the more-robust pace of 20,667 workers per month on average, illustrating a significant pullback\" in hiring.\n2. Services, health care still bright spots\nHiring in the services sector remained relatively strong while other sectors buckled in September. The professional and business services sector, often better-paying white-collar jobs, added 31,000 posts last month. The health care sector, continuing a strong win streak, added almost 35,000 jobs.\nThe weak hiring stands in contrast to the solid readings of consumer sentiment and recent sales of automobiles. When sentiment is strong, it's reflected at the mall and in stores. The retail sector added almost 24,000 jobs last month, while companies engaged in leisure and hospitality led all sectors with 35,000 new posts.\n3. Interest rate hike probably off\nSeptember's phlegmatic hiring makes almost nil the chance that the Federal Reserve will raise, later this month, its key benchmark interest rate. That fed funds rate influences the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses across the economy, and the Fed hasn't raised it in almost a decade.\n\"This likely rules out an increase in the fed funds rate when the (Fed) next meets in late October, and a mid-December rate increase now looks less likely,\" said Gus Faucher, senior economist at PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh. \"Financial markets are now pricing in the first increase in the funds rate in March (2016).\"\nOver the past three months, average job gains were 167,000, and an average through August of 198,000. Job growth has slowed and that should change the risk calculation for politicians engaged in the ritual of threatening a government shutdown or temporarily defaulting on government debt.\nCongress this week passed a measure to keep government funded just through Dec. 11, and the Treasury Department said Thursday that on Nov. 5 it will run out of extraordinary measures it has been using to pay bills and keep under a debt ceiling. After that point the government might have to selectively default on some debt, a move sure to send financial markets into panic mode.\nEither event would amount to a self-inflicted wound in a period of clear weakness.\n\"A jobs market that has lost steam will likely make politicians in Washington less prone to do anything that could hurt the economy further, including a government shutdown or brinksmanship on raising the debt ceiling,\" Nariman Behravesh, chief economist for forecaster IHS Global Insight, told McClatchy.\nSEPTEMBER BY THE NUMBERS\nProfessional and business services, up 31,000\nManufacturing, down 9,000\nLeisure and hospitality, up 35,000\nHealth care, up 34,400\nConstruction, up 8,000\nTemporary help services, up 4,600\nTransportation and warehousing, up 3,500\nRetail, up 23,700\nFinancial services, flat\nGovernment jobs, up 24,000\n(c)2015 McClatchy Washington Bureau\nVisit the McClatchy Washington Bureau at www.mcclatchydc.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/business/businessnews/s-1731786", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/business/businessnews/s-1731786&h=Three+takeaways+from+September%27s+dismal+jobs+report", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/business/businessnews/s-1731786&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T12:33:11.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
