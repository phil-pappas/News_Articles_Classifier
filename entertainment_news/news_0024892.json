Produced by Emmy award-winning film company, Stillmotion , the documentary examines the role we all play in supporting those who struggle in having a stable place from where they can grow and dream.\n\"Our Journey Home\" follows the stories of three families and examines how their relationship to home has shaped them as they strive to support their families, further their education and careers, and give back to their communities. \"Our Journey Home\" debuts today in New York City and will begin a tour across the country following the premiere.\nOnce homeless, Jewel knows firsthand the importance of having a home and the impact it can have on a better future. \"The inspiring families and individuals chronicled in this documentary speak to the feelings of hope and the dreams that a home can help enable,\" says ReThink Ambassador and documentary narrator Jewel. \"I hope this film causes people to stop and rethink the positive impact that public housing can have in helping families across the country.\"\n\"In watching 'Our Journey Home,' the audience is transported inside the walls of public housing so you feel those that live in public housing and how it affects their lives. Through these stories we hope to bring to light the misperceptions many of us carry about public housing,\" added Stillmotion Director and Executive Producer Patrick Moreau.\nPublic housing provides homes and services for approximately 2.1 million people in the U.S. 1 ; however, the need is much greater than that. At least half a million people across the U.S. are waiting for public housing to become available. During a time when poverty has increased by 23.6%, there has been only a 2.7% increase in the supply of assisted housing units, making the need for public housing support even greater. 2\n\"Americans believe that U.S. citizens deserve a safe and stable place to live, but there is little support for public housing. Public housing provides a home for millions of families, veterans, disabled and elderly citizens, and gives them a chance to get back on their feet,\" says Joseph Shuldiner , Executive Director at the Municipal Housing Authority for the City of Yonkers, New York . \"'Our Journey Home' connects viewers to the realities of those living in public housing while dispelling many of the misperceptions of our residents and programs.\"\nReThink: Why Housing Matters is a national awareness initiative that encourages Americans to realize the benefits that public housing offers individuals, families, and the greater community. Visit www.ReThinkHousing.org to watch \"Our Journey Home\" and experience inspirational stories of public housing – and rethink its impact on individuals, families, and your own community.\nGet involved and learn more on Facebook at Facebook.com/ReThinkHousing , Twitter at @ReThinkTweets , and YouTube at YouTube.com/ReThinkHousing .\nAbout ReThink\nReThink: Why Housing Matters communicates the mission and purpose of public housing – to provide housing and services to millions of Americans who might otherwise be homeless.

Picking Up The Pieces, which serves as a \"bookend\" to the Alaskan-born singer's landmark, multi-platinum-selling debut, 1995's Pieces Of You, is some of Jewel's most striking work yet: front and center is the iconic singer-songwriter's world-renowned vocals, laser-sharp songcraft and intricate guitarwork. \"It was time in my life to do this,\" Jewel, who Rolling Stone calls \"one of the most richly idiomatic pop singers of her generation,\" explains of the 14-track LP, recorded in Nashville with seasoned musicians, and featuring road-tested fan favorites (\"Carnivore,\" \"Boy Needs A Bike\") alongside groundbreaking new tracks (\"Love Used To Be\") and a stunning collaboration with country legend Dolly Parton (\"My Father's Daughter\"). Says Jewel: \"I wanted the album to be purely an extension of my soul.\"\nAbout Stillmotion\nStillmotion is a team of loud and curious souls-a team of psychologists, writers, engineers, and photographers who are, quite literally, obsessed with story.
