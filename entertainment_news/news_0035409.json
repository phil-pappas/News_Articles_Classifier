The RIAA argued that states including California and New York recognize the copyrights of older recordings and that Pandora was in violation of those copyrights.\nBrian McAndrews, Pandora’s CEO, said that the music streaming site was “excited to have found a resolution” with the record labels that filed their suit in April 2014. But the settlement only authorizes Pandora to use the songs through 2016. For the years beyond that, the streaming service will have to work out future deals with the labels, with whom McAndrews said Pandora hopes to “continue to foster a better, collaborative relationship”.\nThe settlement also negatively affected Pandora’s quarterly earnings. According to the Los Angeles Times , their shares fell by almost 20% in after-hours trading on Wall Street. This followed the company posting a third-quarter loss of $85.9m on revenue of $311.6m.\nThis agreement marks the latest in a debate over the use of older music. The 1960s band the Turtles are in the middle of a lawsuit against Pandora over use of their music. ABS Entertainment, the company that owns recordings by Al Green and others, is pressing charges against CBS Radio , iHeartMedia and Cumulus. And the same coalition of record labels that reached a settlement with Pandora, also received $210m from the satellite-radio company Sirius XM in June over the use of pre-1972 songs.\nAccording to the RIAA chairman and CEO, Cary Sherman, both settlements ensure “that an iconic generation of artists and the labels that supported them will be paid for the use of their creative works”.\nHe added: “That is a significant milestone and a big win for the music community.”\n Ellen Brait in New York, for theguardian.com on Friday 23rd October 2015 19.11 ", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/4658593/04-noNetworks-noAdsense-mpu&sz=300x250&t=vertical%3Dhome&mob=js&c=", "http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/03/01/poweredbyguardian.png", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/4658593/04-noNetworks-noAdsense-mpu&sz=300x250&t=vertical%3Dhome&mob=js&c=", "http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-pandora-riaa-settlement-20151022-story.html", "http://gu.com/p/4dt3x"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:37:56.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
