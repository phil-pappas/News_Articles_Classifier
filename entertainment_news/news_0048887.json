What's so special?For nearly 40 years, eastsiders have been parking it at the Park Tavern for great food at a fair price. The Lawrence Park restaurant and bar, which was started by Robert and Donna Leszek, is now run by their son, Cris. In addition to friendly service, you'll find plenty of personality throughout the place, with treasures and antiques from the Leszeks' travels, including a bicycle, license plates, skis, signs and more dotting the walls. Great catchSeafood is also a specialty at the Park Tavern. Choose from blackened shark, catfish, salmon, white fish or perch dinners as well as three varieties of fish and chips or shrimp and chips baskets.-- Jennifer Smith ERIE, Pa. -- Step into the Park Tavern, and you'll find a neighborhood joint at its finest. For nearly 40 years, this family-owned pub has been a part of the fabric of daily life for eastside residents. It's a place to watch the game, unwind after work, or catch up with family and friends. For example, during our recent family dinner, we spotted a husband and wife seated in the corner booth, who faithfully come every Wednesday for dinner. We watched as a dad played pool with his teenage son while waiting for their meal. And we were greeted by one of my husband's co-workers, who graciously sent us each a token for a complimentary drink. The table next to us filled up with three generations of the Pletz family, who gathered to catch up with Stephen, Julie and Hunter Pletz from Florida. Most meals here begin with a beer and some munchies. Choose from 19 traditional favorites like soft pretzels, cheese sticks and onion rings, or try one of the amped-up options like onion devils, hollerin' hot pretzel and hot pepper cheese balls. We started with the gooey white cheddar nuggets with pizza sauce. The Park Tavern is known for its wings, ribs and pizza as well as specialty nights. (Monday and Tuesday are steak night with blackened strip steak, steak salad and steak sub, while Wednesday is taco night with hard and soft shell tacos, taco salad and Mexican pizza.) Quality and freshness are important here, which means everything -- pizza, barbecue and wing sauce, coleslaw -- is made from scratch daily. Doug was wearing a suit with a white shirt, so he opted for a fork and the Buffalo chicken tenders topped in Herbie XX -- one of the hottest on the menu. The wings arrived with just the right amount of sauce and dusted with pepper and dry Cajun spices. My taco salad was just the right size, and chock full of well-seasoned meat, crispy tortillas, lettuce and tomato. Each is made to order with your preferred amount of spice. Chili, Chet's favorite, was the right mix of beans and meat with a generous topping of shredded cheese. Max's cheeseburger was almost as big as our 8-year-old. When it was placed in front of him, his eyes were almost as wide as the steak fries on the side. Park Tavern What to know: 4205 East Lake Road; 899-8661; www.theparktavernpa.com .
