Related Content David Cassidy charged in Florida mishap \nThe soft drink company is releasing a new limited edition Pepsi bottle on Oct. 21 to pay tribute to the day Marty McFly arrived in the future in 1989's \"Back to the Future II.\" The 16.9-ounce bottle, branded \"Pepsi Perfect\" just like in the film, will retail for $20.15 to mark the year. In the film, Michael J. Fox's character has a futuristic bottle of the soda delivered to him via pneumatic tube. While the outside of the bottle will be different, what's inside will be an already existing version of Pepsi made with real sugar. \"Pepsi fans asked and we heard them loud and clear,\" said Lou Arbetter, PepsiCo's senior director of marketing, in a statement. \"The 'Back to the Future' trilogy was as big a moment in pop culture history then as it is now, 30 years later. We are excited to be part of this moment and to bring fans something only Pepsi could deliver – and there's no need to wait – the future is now!\" \nThe bottle will be limited to a run of 6,500 and will be sold only while supplies last.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:40:22.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
