Others who want a purebred might think they won't find what they're looking for at a shelter. \"The truth is, a shelter dog has been through physical and behavioral evaluation—and possibly training— at the shelter, so prospective owners have helpful information to determine if a dog is right for their home,\" says Kristina Faller, associate director of communications at Lollypop Farm, the Humane Society of Greater Rochester.\nDogs can end up in shelters through no fault of their own. Owners may:\nbe moving to housing that doesn't allow pets no longer be able to care for pets due to personal or health problems feel they don't have the time to care for the pet be facing financial difficulties Faller points out that all pets have distinct personalities, and even puppies that are purchased may have behavior or temperament issues that are unforeseen. But shelter dogs come with full histories, which can help adopters choose the right fit.\n\"You'd be surprised at how many purebred dogs end up in shelters,\" Faller adds. \"A distinguished pedigree doesn't guarantee that a dog won't end up without a home.\"\nShelters like Lollypop Farm give all adoptable dogs a physical examination and treat them with any necessary medications and spay/neutering surgeries.\nAnd according to Faller, all dogs who are admitted undergo a behavior evaluation to determine what their ideal home environment would be. If an animal has behavioral challenges, the Behavior and Training team works with the pet to train and reinforce good manners and skills.\nRecently, an Alaskan husky mix named Bella was brought to the shelter. She wasn't house-trained and didn't socialize well with other dogs, so the Behavior and Training team worked with her, teaching her how to share her space with other animals.\nWhen Bella's new owners adopted her, Lollypop Farm also gave them a plan to continue the process. After adopting Bella, the owners enrolled her in behavior-training classes at Lollypop Farm.\nMonths later, says Faller, the owners report that Bella is well-behaved, thriving and has become a happy member of the family.\n\"In many cases, a shelter dog just needs a loving, committed home to shine,\" says Faller.\nThis story is provided and presented by our sponsor, Lollypop Farm, Humane Society of Greater Rochester\n.", "external_links": ["http://www.lollypop.org/"], "published": "2015-10-01T13:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:15:31.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
