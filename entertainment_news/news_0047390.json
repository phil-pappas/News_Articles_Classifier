Image 11 of 11 Houstonian’s new Food Network series debuts Oct. 9 1 / 11 Back to Gallery If you were rooting for Houstonian Eddie Jackson during his road to winning \"Food Network Star,\" you don't have long to wait for his promised Food Network series.\n\"BBQ Blitz,\" the show that fitness trainer Jackson got for winning Season 11 of the Food Network competition, premieres Oct. 9 at 9:30 p.m. In the six-episode series, Jackson hits a new city in each episode, including Miami and Charlotte, NC, where he played professional football. The series also visits Dallas, his childhood hometown; Little Rock, Ark., from his college days; Montgomery, Ala., where his extended family lives; and barbecue mecca Kansas City.\nFood Network describes \"BBQ Blitz\" like this:\nEddie hits a new city in each episode and welcomes three of the best local grillers, smokers and fire-roasters to an outdoor cook-off for a grand prize of $5,000 and BBQ bragging rights. The action happens in front of a crowd of cheering spectators, and kicks off with Eddie challenging each competitor to transform their signature grilled masterpiece into a completely different dish for two hungry judges. After an elimination, he chooses one special ingredient that the remaining two must turn into the BBQ dish of their lives. The judges then determine who cooked the best bite, and the $5,000 grand-prize winner is named in front of fans with stadium-style hoopla. Each judging panel mixes culinary experts including Ingrid Hoffman and Kent Rathbun with Eddie's food-obsessed pals like former NFL players Anthony Lucas and Ken Hamlin.\nJackson owns a private gym in Cypress and operates the Caribbean Grill by Fit Chef food truck. He said he will continue to operate the truck at special events. In college, the Richardson, Texas, native played for the Arkansas Razorbacks and later played professionally for the Carolina Panthers (2004), Miami Dolphins (2005-2006) and New England Patriots (2007).\nFor more on \"BBQ Blitz\" and episode guide, see here .", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/37/50/01/8290383/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/37/50/01/8290388/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://blog.foodnetwork.com/fn-dish/2015/09/eddie-jackson-bbq-blitz/", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/70/8756775/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/70/8756781/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/70/8756790/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/70/8756775/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/37/50/01/8290384/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/70/8756789/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/bbq-blitz.html", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/70/8756781/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/37/50/01/8290379/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/70/8756790/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/37/50/01/8290379/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/37/50/01/8290384/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/70/8756776/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/37/50/01/8290386/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/37/50/01/8290383/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/70/8756776/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/70/8756789/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/37/50/01/8290386/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/37/50/01/8290388/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T17:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:25:47.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
