The Chicago City Council is scheduled to vote on the 2016 city budget, which includes the largest property tax hike in modern history.\nThe crescendo is palpable: A city running on borrowed money. Newly elected aldermen who promised not to raise taxes. And Mayor Rahm Emanuel safely in his second term, testing the levers. How much can he squeeze taxpayers — and aldermen — without a backlash?\nEmanuel needs 26 votes on the 50-member City Council to pass his tax hike.\nIf his proposal arrives on the council floor in its current form, the aldermen should vote it down. Emanuel's spending plan does not include the reform he has repeatedly promised. There are few, if any, discernible cuts or efficiencies in his proposed budget. Instead, the city would spend more in nearly every department.\nNor have aldermen been proposing substantial budget cuts. Many want to hide behind tax protection for homeowners even as they'd be penalizing renters and small businesses. Some want only to complain — about a garbage fee, or about plans to contract out 311 telephone service. They have two weeks to stop whining and be creative about spending reforms.\nBut for now this budget is Emanuel's. A flashback to what he said the night he won the election in 2011:\n\"We need to attract and grow the good jobs of today and tomorrow. And we need to confront a budget deficit that threatens our future — but not by burdening Chicago families with more taxes they cannot afford, but by reinventing how city government works. These are the changes we need to set Chicago on the right course for the future with a budget that's balanced and a playing field that's fair.\"\nRahm's budget is built on fear Kristen McQueary When Mayor Rahm Emanuel visited the Chicago Tribune on Tuesday, he asked if anyone in the room had headache medicine.

It was midafternoon, a few hours after delivering his budget speech to the City Council. He did not have a chance to eat. One of my colleagues slid a bottle of Tylenol across the...\n(Kristen McQueary) Reinventing how city government works . Those were his words as he thanked Chicagoans for overwhelmingly electing him mayor.\nEmanuel has taken some steps to make government more accountable. He curbed the city's habit of selling off assets to balance budgets. He instituted a new way of collecting garbage that is more efficient. He is phasing out costly health care benefits for city retirees. He ended free water service to certain nonprofits.\nThe city also decreased its workforce under Emanuel — mostly through attrition, though, not layoffs. He tried to negotiate pension reforms with unions — some of those reforms are now being challenged in court — yet he had little success with police and fire, the two pension funds that make up most of the city's unfunded liability.\nEmanuel says the new property tax revenue would be dedicated to those police and fire funds. But to ask residents and businesses to pick up that tab requires, in exchange, a deeper commitment to decreasing spending wherever possible. Emanuel has not done that with this budget, or any budget before it.\nMayor's planned property tax breaks could hurt many renters, small businesses Bob Secter and Hal Dardick Mayor Rahm Emanuel has framed his record $588 million property tax hike plan around the notion that it will include breaks for those of modest means, but hundreds of thousands of renters who fit that description are still likely to pay more because they can't benefit from the mayor's safeguards.\n... Mayor Rahm Emanuel has framed his record $588 million property tax hike plan around the notion that it will include breaks for those of modest means, but hundreds of thousands of renters who fit that description are still likely to pay more because they can't benefit from the mayor's safeguards.\n... (Bob Secter and Hal Dardick) Chicago's general fund debt is growing faster under Emanuel than it did under the last four years of his predecessor, Mayor Richard M. Daley. New borrowing has been less under Emanuel than under Daley, but Emanuel has continued the risky borrowing known as \"scoop and toss,\" throwing old debt into a new pile of costly borrowing to be paid back later. The city's credit rating fell to junk status under Emanuel, a fact that could cost taxpayers more than $70 million in additional interest payments from one round of borrowing in May alone .\nEmanuel often reminds residents of the fiasco he inherited. It's true. Expensive labor contracts and decades of overspending meant he took title to a house on fire .\nBut with four-plus years under his belt, and economic conditions that are growing the city's revenues, Emanuel can no longer blame Daley. Emanuel has not reinvented government. The city's overall revenues since 2011 have increased 28 percent. Higher fees and fines — remember those red light and speed cameras? — along with hotel and other tourism-related taxes now rake in extra cash. The central business district is prosperous.\nYet property taxpayers from Avondale to Pullman are being asked to do more.\nWhy isn't City Hall doing more?\nThe City Council, city treasurer and more than 15 other departments and agencies would see increases under Emanuel's budget — including the mayor's own office — in raises and new personnel. Departments throughout city government are carrying over vacancies, hoping to fill them. The idea of zero-based budgeting — forcing every layer of government to start at zero and then justify every expense — seems a foreign concept. This is a budget built atop the spending totals of the previous budget, and the budget before that, and the budget ...\nThat's not reinventing government.\nA budget-hawk mayor wouldn't propose spending more on salaries and staff at a time when he's asking taxpayers to dig deeper. A budget-hawk mayor wouldn't ask taxpayers to prop up inefficiencies repeatedly pointed out to him: union work rules that discourage maximizing manpower, work weeks of 37.5 hours with overtime after that, holidays (including Flag Day for some workers) that outpace the private sector's.\nAny alderman who ran on a platform of protecting taxpayers would not vote for a budget that spends more on salaries and personnel with little reform. Yes, that's a nudge to the City Council's freshmen class: Brian Hopkins, 2nd; Gregory Mitchell, 7th; Susan Sadlowski Garza, 10th; Patrick Daley Thompson, 11th; Raymond Lopez, 15th; David Moore, 17th; Derrick Curtis, 18th; Michael Scott Jr., 24th; Chris Taliaferro, 29th; Milagros \"Milly\" Santiago, 31st; Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, 35th; Gilbert Villegas, 36th; and Anthony Napolitano, 41st.\nAnd any incumbent who considers himself or herself to be a budget-hawk alderman would not support this budget.\nBack in 2011 when Emanuel spoke to Chicago on election night, he also said:\n\"I'm proud we've never hidden the truth in this campaign. We said it's time for tough choices because denial, in the face of challenge, is no strategy for success.\"\nDenial, in the face of challenge, is no strategy for success.\nExactly, Mr. Mayor. Let's stop pretending this is the leanest budget you could formulate. Let's stop pretending that, per your horror stories, deep cuts would turn the city toward chaos.\nYou can do more before you call for a massive tax hike. Because denial, in the face of challenge, is no strategy for success.\n Rahm Emanuel Richard M. Daley Raymond A. Lopez David H.
