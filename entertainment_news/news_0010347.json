I'm so sorry about this guys. It's coming it's coming \n— SAM SMITH (@samsmithworld) October 4, 2015 Trust me it's worth it x \n— SAM SMITH (@samsmithworld) October 4, 2015 A lot of angry emails going round. It will be with you VERY SOON. \n— SAM SMITH (@samsmithworld) October 4, 2015 Officially 40 MINUTES till video. What a nightmare. 40 minutes thou…. And it is yours!! \n— SAM SMITH (@samsmithworld) October 5, 2015 \n“Better late than never,” he wrote before he posted the four minute 45 second video, which featured Sam interspersed with clips from Spectre. \nThe video was unveiled on Global James Bond Day, the 53rd anniversary of the first 007 film, Dr No. \nSam made history on Friday when his song became the first Bond theme song to reach number one. \nHere’s what we learned from the video: \n1. Bond’s back to his usual self. (Sam Smith/YouTube) \nAlthough we barely saw any material that hadn’t already been released in the film’s trailers, we did see Bond getting it on with two ladies. Bond can be seen unzipping Lucia’s (Monica Bellucci) dress before the pair get hot and heavy with a kissing (and maybe more) session. \nThe second half of the vid switches to new Bond girl Lea Seydoux with some serious sexual tension. \n2. Someone’s been watching Taylor Swift. (Sam Smith/YouTube) \nEagle-eyed Taylor Swift fans noticed that the keyhole shaped rock at 3:32 is the same one in Taylor’s Style video. Who knew Bond was a closet Swiftie? (Taylor Swift/YouTube) \n3. Rome has some great architecture. (Sam Smith/YouTube) \nSam shot the video in Rome on the same locations as Spectre is filmed. If it’s a glimpse of what we can expect, Spectre is going to have some stunning backdrops. \nA mountain lair, desert and beach also feature in the vid, directed by Sam’s friend and long-time collaborator Luke Monaghan. \n4. Is there a Batman crossover? (Sam Smith/YouTube) \nThere’s a surprisingly large number of lingering, gloomy shots of the clouds. If you stare long enough and squint a bit just above the really dark cloud in the picture below, it kind of looks like Batman’s symbol in the sky – maybe there’s a secret crossover? I love #WritingsOnTheWallVideo , it's such a typical Bond Song but Sams voice sounds so amazing and I just love him", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T12:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:01:59.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
