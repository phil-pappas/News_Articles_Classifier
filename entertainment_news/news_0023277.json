LOUIS -- Monsanto plans to cut 2,600 jobs -- more than 10 percent of its workforce -- in a cost savings move following a disappointing fourth quarter in which it lost nearly $500 million.\nThe agriculture giant, based in suburban St. Louis, said the cuts will occur over the next two years and will result in $275 million to $300 million in annual savings. Monsanto will spend as much as $900 million on the restructuring, which is expected to streamline sales, research and other departments. The company said it also expects to trim another $100 million in operating costs.\nThe move comes after the company ended its recent pursuit of Swiss rival Syngenta, which fended off Monsanto's unwanted merger advances.\nIn a conference call with investors, Monsanto Chairman Hugh Grant said the focus is now shifting to improving the company's position in a weak agriculture market.\n\"We're going to make it a tighter run business,\" Grant said.\nIt's unclear where the cuts will happen. But they will claim roughly 12 percent of the company's workforce of 22,500 employees, half of which are in the U.S. The company has 4,200 in the St. Louis area.\n\"We're currently evaluating our organizational needs and will be making initial changes to our workforce over the coming months,\" spokeswoman Sara Miller said in an email.\nShe said the company also expects to continue hiring in some areas of the company.\nLike others in the agriculture realm, Monsanto has been plagued this year by unfavorable foreign exchange rates and crop surpluses that have driven down commodity prices and dampened seed sales. The company also has been hurt by heavy competition from makers of glyphosate -- the generic version of Monsanto's signature Roundup herbicide. That contributed to a $100 million drop in fourth quarter profits in its Agriculture Productivity division.\nThe company said it had a loss of $1.06 per share. Losses, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were 19 cents per share.\nThe company's performance continues to be impacted by the challenges of an agriculture industry that's seen prices for key commodities, including corn and soybeans, driven downward by recent strong harvests. But the company expects to see some relief in that arena in the near future.\n\"The world is consuming the current oversupply at a record pace,\" Grant said.\nStill, the company raised some eyebrows with it's optimism that it will still meet its five-year goal -- started in 2014 -- of doubling its earnings per share.\n\"It seems surprising that they are still confident of reaching the 2019 goal given the environment they are facing for 2016,\" Chris Shaw, a New York-based analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt & Co., said in an interview with Bloomberg News.\nLooking forward, the company is gearing up for the launch of its next generation of GMO soybeans, which have been engineered to be resistant to the herbicide Dicamba. The seeds have been developed, in part, because of the declining effectiveness of the company's signature Roundup herbicide, sold generically as glyphosate. Farmers are increasingly encountering weeds that have developed resistance to Roundup.\nMonsanto's new soybeans -- which are still awaiting key approvals in China -- are ready for an initial launch that should cover some 3 million acres in 2016. It's not expected to have an significant impact on next year's earnings, but it is the first step in developing what the company believes is a 250 million acre market.\n\"It does mark a significant milestone for future growth,\" said company president Brett Begemann in the investors call.\nThe company also announced plans to repurchase $3 billion worth of its own stock in an expansion of an ongoing program.\nThat move was greeted with criticism from Carol Levenson, a bond analyst for Gimme Credit.\n\"A company facing continuing 'challenges' and 'headwinds' and slashing costs ought not to be adding to its debt load to repurchase stock amid such an uncertain environment,\" Levenson said.\nIts shares were trending upward in early trading Wednesday.\n(c)2015 St. Louis Post-Dispatch\nVisit the St. Louis Post-Dispatch at www.stltoday.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/business/businessnews/s-1734139", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/business/businessnews/s-1734139&h=Monsanto+reports+deep+quarterly+loss%2C+will+cut+2%2C600+jobs+to+pare+costs", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/business/businessnews/s-1734139&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:09:57.522+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
