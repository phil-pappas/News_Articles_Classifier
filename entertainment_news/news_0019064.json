Hart said the agreement, negotiated with the union with the help of the National Mediation Board, was important to ensuring United's flights take off and land on time, an area in which it has long lagged behind rivals.\n\"Our customers care most about taking off and landing on time, and doing so safely, and the unsurpassed efforts of our professional technicians and related employees help make this possible every day,\" Hart said in a company statement. \"Investing in our people is key to United's long-term success, so I'm encouraged that we have reached this agreement with such an important part of our workforce.\"\nThe Teamsters did not immediately respond to calls seeking comment.\nUnited, the Chicago area's largest private employer, is still negotiating with unions representing flight attendants and pilots.\nThe announcement is a boost to the airline, which has come under fire from analysts for not doing more to reduce uncertainty about Munoz's health.\nWhile Munoz's stewardship is seen as essential to United's turnaround effort, some analysts said earlier this week that Hart's background as an attorney and the airline's general counsel meant he was well placed to handle contract negotiations with the unions.\nMunoz's wider plan calls for improvements to customer service, reliability and for the firm to do a better job listening to customers.\nkjanssen@tribpub.com\nTwitter @kimjnews\n Unions United Continental Holdings International Brotherhood of Teamsters Business", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562a6404/turbine/ct-united-teamsters-1024-biz-20151023"], "published": "2015-10-23T20:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:06:02.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
