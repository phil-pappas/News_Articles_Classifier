If the memoirs comprising these early years of youth and beyond serves to inspire the sensual imagination to roam free, as Mr. Halliday believes they shall, then his self-imposed task of placing these words on paper has been a successful use of time.\nReaders who wish to experience this provocative work can purchase “Memoirs of a Gigolo - My Early Years” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708 or Lord Christian Halliday at LordHalliday(at)aol(dot)com and/or through Facebook at http://www.facebook/LordHalliday .\nAbout Page Publishing:\nPage Publishing is a traditional New York based full-service publishing house that handles all of the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
