Such a gentle, kind, funny man and a wonderful actor and toy shop purveyor x \n— Sally Ann Matthews (@SallyAnMatthews) October 23, 2015 \nThe actor first appeared as Coronation Street’s Derek in 1976. His character began dating dithering Mavis Riley shortly afterwards, but their protracted relationship did not lead to marriage until 1988. \nDerek was written out of the soap in 1997 when he had a heart attack after arguing with a driver in a road rage incident. \nPeter, who was born in Sussex, married actress Sarah Long. \nShe presented the BBC’s long-running children’s programme Play School, but died from cancer in 1987. \nAfter Coronation Street, Peter continued to appear on several TV series. \nBetween acting jobs, he worked at Pollock’s Toy Museum and managed its traditional toy shop in London’s Covent Garden, according to the BBC. \nIn 1988, he took over the ownership of the shop. \nThe actor was still recognised for his role in Coronation Street, as he told the BBC in 2010. \n“I even get customers from America, Canada and New Zealand who watch repeats of the show and are very surprised to see me when they walk into the shop,” he said.
