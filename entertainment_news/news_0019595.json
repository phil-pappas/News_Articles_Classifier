Boy, that's down the middle of the road, folks, in all fairness. I mean, Seventh-day Adventists I don't know about, I just don't know about.\" \nCarson apologized last month for suggesting that Trump's faith might not be genuine, and on Fox News Sunday he said Trump is the one who now seems to be making religion an issue. \nBut Trump said Sunday that he didn't insult Carson's Seventh-day Adventist faith. Trump told ABC's This Week, \"I would certainly give an apology if I said something bad about it, but I didn't. All I said was, 'I don't know about it.'\" \nSound: Upcoming", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:03:43.630+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
