Lois Blakey-Paige, pastor of New Canaan Worship Center in Richmond, Virginia preached from Matthew 28:16-20 . That is the passage known as \"The Great Commission .\" As an introduction, Pastor Paige reminded the congregation about Pope Francis' visit to the United States where he humbled himself before the people so many times during his nine-day visit. The pastor reminded listeners that Pope Francis chose his name after St. Francis of Assisi who said, \"Preach the gospel, and if necessary, use words.\"\nThen Pastor Paige explained the Great Commission in terms of being a disciple at its finest. She said the word \"Christian\" is in the Bible only three times; yet, the word \"disciple\" is in the Bible over 200 times. Jesus gave His disciples last-minutes instructions about what they were to do after His ascension. We are to carry out that same commission. The beauty of the Great commission is that we do not have to do it alone. We are joined together in ministry with Jesus and His mission.\nAccording to Matthew 28:17, we see that the disciples obeyed Jesus and were where they were supposed to be at that particular time. When they saw Jesus, they worshiped him, but some doubted. In Matthew 28:18, Jesus let the disciples know that He had all authority in heaven and on earth, and He was acting in that authority and passing the same authority over to them. Because Jesus had the authority, He told the disciples to \"go.\" Pastor Paige said this really means \"going, or as you go.\" As you go, make disciples along the way of all nations.\n\"Reproduce yoursef.\"\nMaking disciples is a process of making other followers of Jesus; not of the pastor, a denomination, or your own movement. As you go and make disciples, baptize them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, according to Matthew 28:19. This is the initial ceremony into the church as a commitment into a new marriage. Then according to Matthew 28:20, we are to teach others all that Jesus has commanded us. We do this by equipping them, explaining to them, and showing them what to do. Jesus concluded in the Great Commission that surely, He will be with us to the very end.", "external_links": ["https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Francis_of_Assisi", "https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028:16-20"], "published": "2015-10-05T05:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:40:52.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
