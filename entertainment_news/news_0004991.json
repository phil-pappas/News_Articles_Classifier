Boylston — They say, whoever they may be, that television is in the midst of a prolonged Golden Age, one that began with HBO’s “The Sopranos” in 1999, and has continued unabated to the present day. One can argue that point, perhaps, but there is little evidence to dispute the notion that the local community theater scene has been going through its own winning streak lately. The latest glittering example was evinced on Thursday evening with Calliope Productions’ splendidly performed and diligently directed staging of one of the great enigmatic plays of the 20th Century, Samuel Beckett’s “Waiting For Godot.” Trying to explain what it is about is akin to describing a sunset to the blind, or a Mozart concerto to the deaf. Good luck. It is comprehensively incomprehensible or incomprehensively comprehensible. Either way, it’s a one of a kind masterpiece of illusive, and allusive, interpretation. One has to give director Dave Ludt immense kudos for not only bringing this haunting allegory to a local stage, but with the revisions Beckett incorporated into a production he directed at the Schiller Theatre in Berlin, Germany in 1975. For a play in which nothing really “happens,” it certainly holds one transfixed with unsettling power and an odd sense of humor. As to what it is about, you will certainly come to your own conclusions, but among them would surely be trying to make sense out of the senseless, as the play’s two main characters, Vladimir (Dwight Patten) and Estragon (Mark Durrenberger), seem to be doing. Referring to each other as “Didi” and Gogo,” they are essentially an existential vaudeville team, waiting for someone named Godot to show up. He never does — no spoiler there — which makes one theorize that Godot is really God, and that we either live in a godless universe, or God exists outside our puny parameters of time and space. The brilliance of “Waiting For Godot” is how it subliminally creates a feeling of simultaneously claustrophobic and terrifyingly infinite solitude. The stark set consists of a single leafless tree with two branches and a rectangular block of stone, upon which Estragon sits and complains about his boots being too tight for his aching feet. He and Vladimir are constantly engaging in loquacious, rambling banter, ranging from what day they were to meet Godot, to Estragon’s casually imparted suggestion of hanging themselves from the tree. And what exactly does the tree stand for? Knowledge? Salvation? Leaves appear on its branches in Act 2, even though only a day has passed since Act 1. Or has it? Since Vladimir and Estragon seem to suffer from short term memory loss, time seems to exist outside the normal corridors of continuity. They can’t seem to recall if they’ve previously met the play’s other two significant characters, Pozzo (Mike Casey) and Lucky (John Goodale). Pozzo and Lucky have a master-slave relationship, Pozzo an imperious, voluble egoist who pulls the silent, bedraggled Lucky around with a rope around his neck, who’s carrying a suitcase and basket full of chicken and wine. Pozzo abuses Lucky by kicking him, while civilly commiserating with Vladimir and Estragon, revealing, among other topics, his fear of the night. After attempting to come to the crying Lucky’s aid, Lucky rewards Estragon with a kick in the shin. Since Estragon had told Vladimir in the play’s opening moments that he vaguely recalls having been beaten the night before — a claim that may or may not be true since no physical evidence is given — one might well surmise that our two protagonists are ensnared in an endless maze of recurring events that can’t be recalled with certainty, until Vladimir insists that Estragon pull up his pant leg to reveal an ugly bruise. Looking for meaning in this strange, puzzling landscape of life, Estragon despairs “What’ll we do? What’ll we do?,” Vladimir laments “I don’t know what to think anymore,” and Pozzo rages against “accursed time” and bemoans that “they give birth astride of a grave.” And in the one time he’s allowed to “think,” Lucky delivers a breathtaking screed on the subject of theology, launched with speed of light elocution and ending with frothing incoherence against a god existing “outside of time.” Then there is the Boy (Elizabeth Schwartz), who shows up in each act to tell Vladimir and Estragon that Godot “won’t be coming this evening, but surely tomorrow.” Asked to elaborate, the boy repeatedly answers with “I don’t know, sir.” If this all sounds too challenging for your theatrical taste buds, you should seriously set aside your reservations and experience it. It’s far more palatable than you might think, a hugely entertaining mind game full of marvelous performances and ideas. Patten and Durrenberger create a musical harmony of acting between them, with a flurry of beautifully timed non-sequiturs and physical slapstick. Durrenberger’s take on Estragon is full of endearing, frumpy contemplation. Patten races through his lines like a questing greyhound in search of his master. Casey blares through the role of Pozzo with wonderful, orotund opulence. Goodale’s mostly mute Lucky stuns with his dazzlingly rendered rant. Schwartz comes across as the existential waif version of Oliver Twist. The brief interludes of background music by Aaron Copeland add an extra touch of cosmic melancholy to this memorable, resonant production. It’s a superb question in search of an answer.
