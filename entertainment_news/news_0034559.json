This time, it will be aired on Kannada entertainment channel Colors Kannada with Kichcha Sudeep hosting the show once again. The first season of the show was telecast on ETV Kannada, which was later renamed Colors Kannada.\nThere were a lot of rumours about the contestants of this year's edition of the show, which will be put to rest once it goes on air this evening. There were even reports suggesting that Sudeep wouldn't be returning as host, which were allayed by the channel and the star himself.\nWhen asked about the contestants of the show, Parameshwar Gundkal, business head of the channel and the director of the show, refused to disclose the details and said, \"You will get the answers to all your queries this evening. We have taken utmost care in selecting the contestants to ensure that there is a right mix. We will not compromise on quality and entertainment.\"\nSudeep is also excited about the show. He says, \"Sometimes, the housemates will feel a little down, and at times they will be happy. I will be talking to them every weekend. I like hosting this show because it gives me an opportunity to maintain a balance in the house by pacifying those who are sad and reigning in the hyperactive. I assure you that this time too, the show will be highly entertaining.\" Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-25T07:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:59:41.163+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
