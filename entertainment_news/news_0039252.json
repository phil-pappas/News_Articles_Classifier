Star Johnny Depp's wife, Amber Heard, was charged with illegally bringing the couple's dogs into Australia against quarantine regulations. She could face up to 10 years in prison and heavy fines if convicted. \nHughes joked at a press conference on Thursday that: \"Since our lovely Chris Hemsworth lives in Australia, I suspect we won't have any issues with pets.\" \nHemsworth told the press conference in a video from Los Angeles that he was looking forward to working again in his home country. \n\"I look forward to introducing my Marvel friends to this beautiful country of ours,\" he said.
