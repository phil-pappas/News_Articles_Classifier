Two of the great moments in the history of music will be presented to Walla Walla Symphony audiences on Nov. 17: Beethoven’s “Symphony No. 5” and Sir Edward Elgar’s “Cello Concerto in E minor.” For a group of students in Seattle I once played a late Haydn symphony (No. 100), followed by a late Beethoven symphony (No. 8). These were young teenagers, unused to classical music, but their jaws dropped. The Haydn was beautiful, elegant, easily understood; then the Beethoven was in another world entirely, full-bodied, rich with feeling and a meaning you could almost grasp. Flash forward just 20 years. What happened? A few years ago I was at a concert with a music scholar, and I recounted the story to him and my question. His two-word answer: “Beethoven’s Fifth.” Think you’ve heard this warhorse often enough, with its “fate knocking” opening theme? I guarantee you have not. It exemplifies the perpetual youth of great art because of the enormous wealth of ideas it incorporates. If for no other reason, I would attend just to hear this masterpiece. But there is more on the Symphony program, more indeed. Cellist Sally Singer Tuttle will perform Sir Edward Elgar’s “Cello Concerto,” one of the richest and most beloved works of late Romantic music. It was composed in the immediate aftermath of World War I. Elgar conducted the first performance in 1919. The performance was a disaster. Although the soloist had mastered his part, and Elgar himself was conducting, the London Symphony Orchestra managers had not given him enough rehearsal time and the ensemble work fell apart. Consequently, it was not performed a second time for at least a year. Although its fortunes improved, it did not become popular until 1965. In that year it was performed and recorded, again with the London Symphony Orchestra, by 20-year-old Jacqueline du Pré. (For a fictionalized, generally inaccurate, account of the troubled life of this young genius, see the movie “Hillary and Jackie.”) Her record became a hit, and along with it, the concerto. She was later diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, and by 1973, she could no longer perform. Thus was cut short one of the great musical careers. Make a donation not just to your favorite symphony, but also to medical research, please. As an interesting aside, the very first recording of the work was also made with an outstanding British female soloist, Beatrice Harrison, in 1920. Elgar, an early enthusiast of the gramophone, conducted. They recorded with acoustical, rather than electrical, microphones. Harrison, at 28, impressed Elgar so favorably that he thereafter insisted that he would only perform his work if she played the solo. I must mention one other thing about Beatrice Harrison. She was a pioneer in radio performance as well as gramophone recordings, made in her garden with nightingales singing in the background. Then she released recordings of the nightingales alone, and of the “dawn chorus” of birds in the garden. These early nature recordings were so popular that some cynics proposed that the bird songs were faked by a trained whistler. Spoilsports preceded the Internet. The Elgar concerto will be performed at Whitman College’s Cordiner Hall by yet another outstanding British female soloist Sally Singer Tuttle. Sally now lives in Walla Walla, teaches at Whitman, and performs with the Volta Piano Trio, the Walla Walla Chamber Music Festival and the Walla Walla Symphony. She, like Beatrice Harrison, has worked in crossover experiments, serving as artistic director for New York-based Sankusem, an organization dedicated to performing African music written for western classical instruments. She has a CD of this work coming out soon. She has also recorded a work by Lou Harrison for violin, cello and Indonesian gamelan, traditionally consisting of gongs and sets of tuned metal instruments struck with mallets. In other performances (also see the accompanying Music Box for venues and dates): At the First Thursday performance at St. Paul’s Episcopal Church, Walla Walla native AnnRené Joseph will give a program of songs and poetry to illustrate “how our lives are an artwork in progress.” She is an experienced teacher, motivational speaker and coach — should be very inspirational. The Whitman Orchestra’s fall concert will feature Schubert’s Symphony No. 8 (“Unfinished”); some of Bartók’s Romanian Folk Dances; and, of special interest, a suite for soprano and orchestra excerpted from John David Earnest’s new opera “The Theory of Everything,” dealing with the paradoxes and personalities of quantum physics. The Whitman choral concert focuses on war and peace, with music from the Middle Ages to the present, including Bernstein’s “Chichester Psalms.” Conductor Riikka Pietiläinen-Caffrey is including one of her own compositions, “Kottarainen,” Finnish for “The Starling.” John Jamison teaches in the Quest program at Walla Walla Community College and serves on the board of the Walla Walla Symphony.
