Odom had said that he had done cocaine before his arrival, and the brothel said they saw him drink alcohol and take as many as 10 supplements sold as \"herbal Viagra.\" One brand that he took, Reload, was the subject of a 2013 warning from the Food and Drug Administration, which said the pill contained sildenafil, the active ingredient in prescription Viagra. \nThe brothel also said he became upset Sunday following a phone call where his ex's \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" show was mentioned. But he was generally in a good mood, even suggesting that he stay an entire week at the brothel in the rural community. \nOdom was then found unconscious there Tuesday with white and reddish substances coming from his nose and mouth. He was breathing and taken to Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center in Las Vegas. \nKardashian rushed to his side that night and since then, friends, teammates and loved ones have visited and posted messages on social media asking for prayers. On Wednesday at the hospital, the Rev. Jesse Jackson said Odom was on life support. \nFriday's latest update on Odom's health condition comes as Mercer and Kardashian just hours earlier started speaking out to thank fans. \nKardashian had said her family won't be posting content on their apps while attending to his health crisis. The online message read: \"As a family, we've decided to hold off on publishing content across our apps while we continue to support and pray for Lamar.\" \nShe also thanked fans for their kindness and understanding. The message was addressed to fans as a note from Kardashian on her blog-like app. Announcing a posting black-out is a rarity for the family, who meticulously document their lives on various social media channels and on the \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" television show. \nMeanwhile, Mercer had issued her own statement Friday to thank the public for its support, saying they're family was focused on Odom's \"complete healing.\" \n\"No words can express the overwhelming gratitude we feel for the outpouring of support from around the world,\" the statement issued Friday said. \nAlston said Mercer is the sister of Odom's late mother who helped raise him in New York, where she still lives. Mercer and other family members are now in Las Vegas. The statement said: \"His complete healing is paramount and our primary focus.\" \nThe former NBA star had been a beloved member of the Los Angeles Lakers, winning two championships with the team and enjoying widespread fame as a reality TV star himself before his recent downward spiral, which included leaving pro basketball, a pending divorce with Kardashian and a DUI arrest.
