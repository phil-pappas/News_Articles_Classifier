Five of the 11 artists involved are expected to be there on the day: John Eaden, Desna Schollum, Timo Rannali, Kate Mackenzie and Freeman White. \nSome people will have already had a glimpse as the panels, reproductions of the originals, went up on Thursday. But now they are covered until the ‘big reveal’ on Sunday. \nThere will be lots of fun for the kids and their parents - with 1920s games, music by the Twin City Stompers, the Napier Operatic Society performing an extract from the Wizard of Oz and black and white Charlie Chaplin movies. \nThe road will be closed for the celebrations which will allow people to take a close look at the 103 metres of art. \nWorks by 10 artists’ each represent a decade of the 100 years, while the 11th artist’s works covers special highlights. \nThe opera house has been at the heart of Hawke’s Bay’s community since it opened in October 1915. \nOver the following 99 years it has hosted an amazingly diverse range of artists, productions and events, from boxing matches and opera, to musicals and galas. \nThe opera house and Municipal Buildings were closed last year when it was found they were earthquake-prone. A project to investigate options for the future is underway; however in the meantime the building turns 100 years old this month. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
