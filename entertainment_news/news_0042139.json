LaBeouf was taken into custody for public intoxication with no force. \nAccording to TMZ, the star was \"out of control and disobeyed police,\" who cuffed him. Local affiliate KVUE reports LaBeouf allegedly attempted to cross against a \"Don't Walk\" sign. Public intoxication is a misdemeanor charge. \nLaBeouf sought treatment for alcohol addiction last year after being arrested outside of a Broadway performance of Cabaret and charged with criminal trespassing and disorderly conduct. \nIn March, a judge ordered the actor to spend three months in treatment and display six months of good behavior following the incident. In return, the charges would be dropped. \nRepresentatives for LaBeouf did not immediately respond to request for comment.
