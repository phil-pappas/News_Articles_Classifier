He was born in California and at the age of eight moved to Germany. He has had a varied and interesting career path spanning forklift truck driver, undercover store detective, German Linguist for the US Army Military Intelligence and General Manager of the San Diego Reader - the fifth largest weekly newspaper in the US. Sean began to pursue his hobbies of stand-up comedy and auctioneering over 15 years ago, and came up with the idea that Storage Hunters is based upon. \nThe format currently airs in 37 countries worldwide. \nHe said: “I love performing stand-up comedy. As a kid I was addicted to listening to my mom’s comedy albums and the first stand-up I ever saw live was Robin Williams - I was 10 years old and hooked. Because my big influences were storytelling comics like Robin, my act tends to be funny stories about my life and travels around the world. Since I lead an unfiltered life and speak my mind, I often embarrass myself in public - but I am happy to share those stories with my audience. My goal is for my audiences to leave feeling like they know me much better.” \nStorage Hunters fans won’t leave disappointed either, as they will get to observe Sean’s legendary calling live at the end of each show, as he auctions off items brought in by the audiences for local charities. \nSean has been writing and performing his stand-up comedy act for over 15 years and has headlined the MGM in Las Vegas every summer for the past three years. From 2001 to 2009 Sean produced and starred on seven stand-up shows a week for eight consecutive years, where he performed his act for over 500,000 people.
