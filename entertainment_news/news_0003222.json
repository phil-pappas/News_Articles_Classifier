In an open letter to the Sangam wishing all those who won, the Singam star had stated that the recent election taught them a lot of lessons, where many disturbing incidents took place during canvassing as well as voting. Hinting at Sarath Kumar’s pungent remarks on Kamal while sorting out the latter’s Uttama Villain and Vishwaroopam release problems, Suriya remarked that actors in key posts considered doing their duties as help to the concerned, which is improper. He added, “Candidates and their supporters criticised their opponents in a shameful manner. Despite claiming that all artistes belonged to the same family, things were taken personally and caste, language and creed were used in an attempt to split the Sangam. Actors who showed inclination towards a team were verbally abused, including senior artistes.” He felt that it is the duty of all artistes to ensure that such situations never arise. Suriya has also made a few requests to the newly-elected team. He said, “Do not take discharging your duties as help to others. Please set an example to others in respecting senior artistes. Make sure every artiste is benefitted through Nadigar Sangam. Fulfil your promises from the bottom of the heart. Do not develop hatred and we will all join hands together and work as a team to make this Nadigar Sangam a better place.” Kollywood Suriya elections Nadigar Sangam Also Read Meghan Trainor wants 'Dear Future Husband' song-like hubby Kangana Ranaut says she deserves high remuneration Nayanthara to star in Bruce Lee?
