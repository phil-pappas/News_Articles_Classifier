Meanwhile, the director of SIB, Prabhudheva, is doing a victory dance in Mumbai.\nREAD: Salman Khan keen to watch 'Singh is Bliing'\nListen to songs of Rowdy Rathore on Gaana.com\nThis enjoyable, mainstream film is a result of the Bollywood superstar and the filmmaker's mutual admiration and respect for each other. Singh Is Bliing , produced by Grazing Goat Pictures LLP and Pen India Ltd that released on October 2, is the highest opener for this actor-director duo in India and overseas. The film managed a whopping day one collection, making it the second highest opener of 2015. The music has been appreciated too.\nRowdy Rathore (RR) , their last cinema outing together, also broke records. This time around, the duo is hopeful that besides the initial box office deluge, they have already broken the opening records of RR .\nSpeaking to Bombay Times from London, Akshay says, \"I've always loved working with my South Indian directors, be it Prabhu, AR Murugadoss ( Holiday — A Soldier Is Never Off Duty ) or Priyadarshan ( Hera Pheri, Bhool Bhulaiyaa, De Dana Dan ). They are soft-spoken and effective. Their heads are brimming with ideas but they work in a quiet, meticulous way. You cannot expect them to speak more than necessary. I admire their discipline.\"\nThe actor adds that SIB worked because of many factors. He says, \"It was made in record time and budget and this time around Prabhu had a different bent of mind.'' Ask him to elaborate and Akshay quips, \"Usually Prabhu's movies lean 80% towards the men and 20% towards women. In this film, he has given men and women a 50:50 deal. The characters played by Amy Jackson and Lara Dutta have equal footage as my own character, Raftar Singh.''\nAkki, who is one of the biggest advocates of women empowerment, says, \"I believe every single woman must see herself as an equal. In Mumbai, where my martial arts camp is conducted, it's terrific to see working women who come in their office wear — saris, business suits or skirts — to undergo training. They punch like professionals. Their goal is not to become martial art experts but to protect themselves in daily life. For me, a strong woman who can safeguard herself on a day-to-day basis is a path-breaker. I had mentioned this in passing to Prabhu and the writers of SIB , and I liked the way they included this in the film.''\nAkshay, who is called a one-man industry as he does three to four Bollywood movies a year, netting huge box-office numbers and providing livelihood for a big work-force, concedes he believes in his own method of elimination. He says, \"Some actors prefer to be choosy and do one film at a time. I want to continue with my own way of working and do three to four films a year. I don't need five months to get under the skin of a character. My objectives are simple; I'm here to entertain and ensure no one loses money on my account. Hence, my choice of scripts is a mixed bunch and the budgets of my movies are controlled.''\nThe actor says he understands that at this stage in his career, he may need to think of slowing down and going easy on parts that are high on testosterone. But, surely that is a plan for another day. For now, Akki is happy that on one hand, he enjoys his equation with an astute filmmaker like Neeraj Pandey ( Special 26, Baby and the soon-to-be launched Rustom ) while on the other hand, he loves the commercial movie space. \"Nothing is about to change in the way I think,'' he admits, adding, \"In my next bunch, there is Airlift that speaks of the evacuation of Indians from Kuwait after Saddam Hussein's invasion and Rustom . And there are my comedies like Housefull 3 , which I'm currently filming in UK.''\nPrabhudheva called to add that shooting SIB was a breeze. \"Ashvini Yardi (producer) and her team had made thorough preparations. We shot the film in five countries, but were able to complete the shooting in six months. Honestly, this is only possible when the production team has done its recce well.''\nTalking about his lead actor, Prabhu says, \"Akshay is a disciplined man. You can ask him to report for work at 6 am and he will be there on the dot. Besides this, he is a director's delight because he doesn't interfere on set. I call him a jolly man because even after two decades of being an actor, he has a childlike innocence and enthusiasm when it comes to his work. If you are able to convince him that this is the requirement of the scene, he will give it all he has. Be it dance, action, emotion or even outright comedy, Akshay sir is game for everything. He is a director's delight. The nice thing about him is that he knows he is here to entertain. So, he goes about his job with single-minded dedication.''\nPrabhu adds that giving his women something more to do than just wear nail polish and look pretty was a new thing for him. \"I was happy to have Amy and Lara doing something more on screen than being mere bystanders,'' he remarks. \"I was pleasantly surprised when I went to the theatre and saw that Amy's action scenes got the audience excited. When Lara did her 'I'm-not-a-helpless-woman' stuff, they were enjoying it,'' he elaborates.\nOne more thing that Prabhu and Akshay readily agree on is the fact that they both understand the box office compulsions of the movie business. Prabhu says, \"I had an eye on the budget because besides making a commercially sound film, I wanted my producers to make a profit.'' Akshay adds, \"That's what makes Prabhu a boon for a producer. He realises how important budgeting is and it's his conscientiousness that makes a film profitable.''\nFor latest Bollywood updates follow us on Twitter >>> @TOIEntertain\nFor the latest in Bollywood news, like us on Facebook >>> TOIEntertain\nFor more interesting Bollywood news and pictures follow us on Pinterest>>> timesofindia\nFor latest Bollywood updates follow us on G+ >>> The Times of India Entertainment\nWATCH: Amy Jackson: 'Singh Is Bliing' milestone of my career - TOI\nRowdy Rathore Amazon.in : INR 80.00 Buy now ", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/1DPQB3pOfcQ", "http://gaana.com/album/rowdy-rathore-hindi", "https://www.pinterest.com/timesofindia/", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107628521107103264647/+TOIEntertainment/posts", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41OXR4Ih5qL._SL160_.jpg", "https://twitter.com/TOIEntertain", "http://www.amazon.in/Rowdy-Rathore-Akshay-Kumar/dp/B008NN36IE%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJP4GPDYQHXPFUOWQ%26tag%3Dtimofind-21%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB008NN36IE"], "published": "2015-10-08T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T00:51:38.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
