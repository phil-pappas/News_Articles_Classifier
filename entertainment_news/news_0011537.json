Working with top actors is my dream.” Proneeta Swargiary from Punit Pathak’s team has won season 5 of Dance India Dance. Speaking to us after the big win she said, “Winning this season is a dream come true. I had auditioned for season two, in which Punit was also a participant. He got selected but I didn’t. I was dejected and spent the last few months training harder and auditioned again. Thankfully, my family has always been supportive. I had a tough competition from Ashish, but I am glad I won this.”\nHer proud mentor Punit said, “Right from the first day at the rehearsals, which was three-and-a-half months ago, I had seen potential winners in Proneeta and Ashish. I spoke to them separately and told them that they have a star quality. I was just hoping one of them wins and Proneeta did that and made me proud.”\nSharing her dreams for the future, Proneeta says, “I want to choreograph for Bollywood films. Working with top actors is my dream.”\nAs for Punit, he will be working behind the camera as stage director for Amitabh Bachchan’s show Aaj Ki Raat Hai Zindagi.\n Proneeta Swargiary Dance India Dance entertainment television Also Read 'Fast and Furious 7' will use body doubles for Walker scenes Yet another M’town girl in Kollywood Big Sean asks Justin Bieber to keep hands off his girl Vishnu to sport a new look for Ezhil", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/12WINNER%20PRONEETA%20WITH%20WINNING%20MASTER%20-PUNIT%20%282%29.jpg", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/12WINNER%20PRONEETA%20WITH%20WINNING%20MASTER%20-PUNIT%20%282%29.jpg", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151011/entertainment-tvmusic/article/proneeta-has-made-me-proud-punit-pathak", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-12T13:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:18:29.179+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
