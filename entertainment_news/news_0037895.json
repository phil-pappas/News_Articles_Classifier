There's just so many possibilities.\nOK, there's two possibilities, but that doesn't make it any easier. Obviously you could just shower twice, but that's not great for you skin, or your water bill.\nWell thanks to science, yep, it's back again, we now know the best time of the day to step under the nozzle, and it actually varies from person to person.\nGreatist went to the trouble of talking to a number of experts in the fields of psychology, sleep therapy and dermatology, just to give you a definitive answer to the question.\nIf you're a creative type, take one early in the morning as the brain enters into the relaxed alpha brain wave state. When in this state, your brain's cognitive processes relax, allowing you to think clearer and makes it easier for ideas stored away in your brain to rise to the top.\nWe're not saying we always have eureka moments in the shower, but they do tend to happen when we're in the toilet for another reason, and we assume it's all part of the same thing. Anyway, another good reason to shower early on is the fact that your body has a surge of blood-clotting platelets in the early hours, so if you knick yourself shaving, it'll heal quicker.\nOn the other hand, if you find it hard to relax and switch off at night, a shower could be the best medicine. A hot shower raises your temperature, and the cooling down which occurs once you hop out of it works as a natural sleep inducer. You're basically tricking your body into thinking it's bed time. Take that, stupid body.\nThe late night option is also a great way to get rid of the dirt that clogs up your pores during the day, so you don't get another 8 hours covered in filth, which seems sound to us.\nVia Ask Men\nMORE: Tonight may just be the best night to see the Perseids meteor shower in a long, long time\nMORE: Capture the colour of October and #paintitpink this Breast Cancer Awareness Month!\nMORE: New survey says Ireland amongst the most tolerant of EU nations", "external_links": ["http://ie.askmen.com/news/sports/the-best-time-of-day-to-shower-according-to-science.html", "http://greatist.com/grow/best-time-to-shower"], "published": "2015-10-02T21:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T13:08:39.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
