FILE PHOTO AP Related article » NORCO WATER SAVINGS The city's water reduction, by percentage, compared to 2013 (the city's goal is 36 percent):\nJuly : 23.8\nAugust : 25.2\nSeptember : 33\nNorco‘s water agency, one of several Inland water districts that have continually failed to meet state-mandated water reductions, narrowly missed again in September.\nStill, city officials -- who have purview over the water district -- applauded the latest effort, attributing water cuts to non-potable irrigation in public parks, as well as increased public outreach.\nWater districts have helped slash statewide usage by 28.7 percent between June 1 and Aug. 31, compared with 2013 – the comparison year for Gov. Jerry Brown’s 25 percent statewide reductions. September figures haven’t yet been made public on the State Water Resources Control Board website, but Norco revealed its 33 percent reduction last week.\nEach district has been given its own water saving objective. Norco is still 3 percent short of the city’s target, but public works consultant Bill Thompson said it’s a step in the right direction.\n“Short of fining people, I don’t know what else we can do,” Thompson said. “As long as we’re making progress, I don’t think we’ll be looking to fine a particular portion of the community.”\nWater districts in Norco, Redlands, Yucaipa Valley, West Valley (Rialto), and Beaumont-Cherry Valley could face fines of $500 per day this month if they fail to comply with the state cuts. Each of the districts is more than 10 percentage points away from meeting their goals this year.\nYucaipa Valley curtailed water use by about 19 percent last month, said Water District General Manager Joe Zoba. That’s about 7 percent less than it was able to conserve in August, bringing the district even further from its 36 percent reduction goal.\nRedlands officials have hired two waste investigators since June, sending about 3,000 letters to the top consumers, according to Utilities Director Chris Diggs.\nIn Norco, no staff members are dedicated solely to water conservation. Thompson said he’s issued verbal warnings to a few of the most egregious water wasters. Still, the city has yet to dole out a single fine. Instead, officials have been looking at ways to lessen water use at public locales.\nAbout 17 percent of Norco’s water is used on public land, Thompson said. Large strides have been made in the last two months by switching to non-potable irrigation at Snipes Park and the Fifth Street median adjacent to the prison, Thompson said. Those projects are expected to continue at local schools and other parks.\n“If we have full use of our recycled water, plus residents are helping conserve, we’ll probably meet our goal,” Norco City Manager Andy Okoro said. “We believe we’re moving toward compliance. Implementing our reclaimed water, that’s our big silver bullet on this thing.”\nCalifornia residents will have to be even more rigorous during the next several months, when there is less opportunity for big savings on outdoor water use, California Water Board Chairman Felicia Marcus previously said. In Norco, residents historically use 5.5 million gallons more per day in the summer than they do in winter, Thompson said.\nThe state has urged people to water once a week or less starting in October. El Niño conditions could bring heavy rainfall to southern California this winter, making that easier to do.\nContact the writer: 951-368-9644, poneill@pe.com , @PE_PatrickO", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw6on1-b88539702z.120151013171152000ggqcikn9.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/nw6on1-b88539702z.120151013171152000ggqcikn9.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:32:45.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
