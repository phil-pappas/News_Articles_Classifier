(Jamie McCarthy / Getty Images) Tribune wire reports Contact Reporter Denzel Washington returns to TV, behind the camera \nMulti-award winning actor Denzel Washington is stepping behind the camera to direct an episode of \"Grey's Anatomy\" this season, Variety has confirmed. \nThe gig marks Washington's first time directing television, though he has directed two films: \"Antwone Fisher\" in 2002 and 2007's \"The Great Debaters,\" in both of which he starred. \nWashington will direct episode nine of the current 12th season, TVLine first reported, which goes into production later this month. No storyline details have been released, but longtime \"Grey's\" writer/producer Stacy McKee will write the episode. \nThough the episode will serve as Washington's first time sitting in a Shondaland director's chair, he did previously visit the \"How To Get Away with Murder\" crew, posing for a photo with Viola Davis at a table read last year. \nWashington also has close ties with Debbie Allen, who was upped to full-time exec producer on \"Grey's\" for Season 12. Allen, who has directed a slew of TGIT episodes on all three shows and will direct more \"Grey's\" this season, is in charge of choosing the episodic directors for the long-running medical drama.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T23:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:29:40.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
