We look like another boy band,\" Timberlake quipped.\nTimberlake thanked GLSEN for finally \"allowing mommy and daddy to have a rare date night out\" from their baby boy, Silas. He also thanked the org for its 25 years of promoting positive change.\n\"Thank you GLSEN for everything that you do to ensure individuality of every kid that is lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, is respected, protected and treasured in our schools,\" said Biel.\nZachary Quinto and YouTube also received kudos for their support in providing a safe space for young people who identified as LGBT. GLSEN promoted the company's #ProudToLove campaign, which showed a video montage of YouTube coming out videos that turned into wedding videos after the Supreme Court ruled same-sex marriage legal nationwide earlier this year.\nLast year's honorees Bob Greenblatt and Julia Roberts were in the audience to continue their support for the organization at it's 11th annual awards show dinner. Longtime GLSEN supporter and \"ET\" exec producer Brad Bessey said that celebrity allies have really blossomed GLSEN's Respect awards into the organization's flagship auction event that it is today.\n\"I think that these high-profile celebrities allow us to send this message across the country and show the real heroes -- these young GLSEN ambassadors who are actually in their schools and making a difference,\" Bessey told Variety.\nOther celebrity guests in attendance included \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" director J.J. Abrams, Dana Delany, MTV star Todrick Hall, producer Joe Zee and YouTube sensation Gigi Gorgeous.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T19:37:12.304+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
