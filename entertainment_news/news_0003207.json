Photo: Chris Hopkins \nNothing, it seems, is too serious or too dangerous to be made fun of by John Safran.\nRight from the start, when he came to national attention by streaking naked through the streets of Jerusalem in the ABC documentary project Race Around the World , Safran has made a career out of being crazy-brave. Which is why in 2013, Safran flew to Mississippi to prank Richard Barrett, high priest of the American white supremacist movement and self-styled leader of the ultra-nationalist Skinheadz group, for a satirical documentary\nWhat could possibly go wrong?\nNot long after Safran flew to the American South Richard Barrett, the subject of his prank documentary, wound up dead. Photo: Sally Pryor \n\"I pranked Barrett and he didn't like it at all,\" Safran says, chuckling. \"He started legal action so we just had to dump the segment.\"\nAdvertisement That was that, thought Safran. \"I just got on with my life.\"\nThen, a few months later, Safran learned Barrett was dead. \"I'm cruising a white-supremacist website, as you do, and there it was – a report saying Barrett has been murdered by a young black man called Vincent McGee, who claimed Barrett had made sexual advances toward him, which led to, one way or another, Barrett being killed.\"\nSafran had no love for Barrett. \"But I was quite confused by it all,\" he says. \"I spent two days filming this man, two days in his world, and now he's dead and I didn't know what to make of it.\"\nThose uncertain feelings eventually distilled themselves into Safran's first book, Murder in Mississippi , and in turn into the performance monologue Safran is bringing to Giant Dwarf.\nSafran's starting points were the great books in the true-crime genre: Truman Capote's In Cold Blood  and John Berendt's​ Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil . But Capote and Berendt were experienced and brilliant writers. Safran was a first timer.\n\"I was trying to work out how to write a book and how to investigate a case at the same time, and figure it all out on the spot,\" Safran says. \"I didn't know what I was doing. I was desperately trying to catch it all on my dictaphone.\"\nOnce the book was published, Safran took a typically unconventional approach to promoting it.\n\"Usually you get David Marr or someone like that to sit on a chair opposite you in a town hall and ask questions,\" Safran says. \"But I'd never done anything like that before, and I started getting really worried that people would turn up to see me slumping in a chair mumbling. I was worried I'd leave a bad impression, so I ended up writing this monologue.\"\nMurder in Mississippi includes excerpts for the book, audio recordings of Safran's interviews with McGee in prison and unaired video clips of the elaborate prank he pulled on Barrett.\nDoes the audience need to read the book first? \"I don't reveal all the plot twists in the live show,\" Safran says. \"If there's a question like, what happened to blah blah, then I'll tell them, but I do it in a way that doesn't ruin it for people who still want to read the book.\"\nA surprising number of people seem to think Safran is a stand-up comic. He thinks of himself more of a provocateur than a comedian.\n\"When I'm doing something, I tend to lose myself in it. I don't think too hard about making things funny,\" Safran says. \"I'm just attracted to weird things in the world that have ironies or hypocrisies, or some weird cultural fault line. Then it ends up being a bit funny naturally.\n\"With this story, some people are laughing the whole time, and I'm up there thinking, hang on I'm talking about someone being murdered here, calm down guys.\"\nJohn Safran: Murder in Mississippi in on October 29 to November 1 at Giant Dwarf, Redfern; $35-$40.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:33:31.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
