Gabrielle McClinton as the Mephistophelean Leading Player and Brian Flores as the idealistic Pippin ably head a strong cast that puts the show across with energy and flair.\nDirector Diane Paulus’ explosively inventive production takes off from her inspired decision to make it a circus troupe that is enacting the tale of young prince Pippin, his search for himself and fulfillment in life. She achieved the show’s striking visuals and vibrant atmosphere in tandem with Gypsy Snider, who devised the exhilarating circus acts that embellish the scenes, and Chet Walker, who has choreographed in the style of original director/choreographer Bob Fosse. For one famous trio, the Fosse moves have been exactly recreated, and overall, the show retains his distinctive dance profile, with its slinkily strutting allure.\n\"Pippin\" When: 7:30 p.m. Wednesday-Thursday, 8 p.m. Friday, 2 and 8 p.m. Saturday, 2 and 7:30 p.m. Sunday\nWhere: Broadway at the Hobby Center, 800 Bagby\nTickets: $25-$105; 800-982-2787, broadwayatthehobbycenter.com\nWhether dance, song, acrobatic stunt or even a few neat illusions — sometimes all at once — something is always happening that leads directly to the next something happening. This “Pippin” proves a perfect example of how to revitalize a classic show while remaining faithful to the strengths and spirit of the original.\nIt even brings a shade more sincerity to the heart of the show, the innocence of Pippin’s quest and the genuine appeal of the home stretch depicting his romance with an understanding widow. Chiefly through a fresh handling of Catherine, the love interest, the revival gives these key scenes particular charm and warmth. It’s one of the ways it makes a stronger case than the original did for Roger O. Hirson’s clever book and Stephen Schwartz’s consistently winning score.\nThe book unfolds in quick, broad strokes, as it follows Pippin’s search for meaning, through soldiering, the joys of the flesh, social reform and domestic life. Yet it boasts flashes of wit, as when commenting on the burdens of leadership, and instills a good deal of feeling in that late-blooming romance.\nSchwartz’s exuberant score remains a central strength, abounding with infectious tunes and neatly turned lyrics. Right at the start, it knocks the ball out of the part with the all-important opening number “Magic to Do” and the crucial “wanting song” for the protagonist, the soaring “Corner of the Sky.” Other gems include the Carib-flavored “Simple Joys,” the show-stopping “No Time At All,” the exalting “Morning Glow” — which makes a great Act 1 finale (the original “Pippin” had no act break) — and the three songs involving Catherine, her wry self-appraisal “Kind of Woman,” her sweet “Love Song” with Pippin, and the poignant “I Guess I’ll Miss the Man.” Many have tried, but few scores have done as good a job melding pop influence with traditional Broadway tunefulness, variety, dramatic purpose and showmanship.\nMcClinton’s Leading Player makes a suitably charismatic ringmaster, with a powerful yet smooth vocal attack and a catlike grace in her prowling moves. Easy to see how she ensnares Pippin, since she’s doing the same to the audience — yet her toughness lends the right tension, clueing us in that she’s not to be entirely trusted.\nFlores is just about ideal as Pippin: youthfully earnest in his quest, with an athletic energy and a strong and supple voice that soars its way through “Corner of the Sky,” “Morning Glow” and “Extraordinary.”\nBradley Benjamin lends the right humor, warmth and pleasing voice to Catherine, realizing the revival’s take on the heroine as a bit ditsy yet supremely confident as regards her rightness for Pippin. I especially like the bits where she has to stand her ground against the hostile interference of the Leading Player (who, of course, has other ideas for Pippin).\nJohn Rubinstein, the original Pippin, brings authority to Charlemagne, Pippin’s father, finding robust comic opportunities in the pompous yet shrewd ruler. Sabrina Harper is sleek and dynamic as his scheming wife Fastrada, reveling in her classic showgirl turn “Spread a Little Sunshine.”\nYet the show’s pinnacle belongs to Adrienne Barbeau as Pippin’s wise and irrepressible grandmother, who expounds her seize-the-day philosophy in the irresistible “No Time at All.”\nBarbeau delivers the song eloquently, with feeling and comic punch, even while borne aloft in a ring trapeze for her own impressive stunt work. This always was a great number, yet is greater still with the revival’s visual fillip, which so perfectly embodies the message of the song.\nIt will be tough for any other tour this season to surpass the life-affirming exuberance and vibrant theatricality that make “Pippin” so special.", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/03/8802514/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/03/8802511/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/03/8802510/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/03/8802513/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/03/8802515/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/03/8802511/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/03/8802510/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/03/8802515/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/03/8802514/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/03/8802513/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/03/8802512/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/03/8802512/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T15:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T15:26:56.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
