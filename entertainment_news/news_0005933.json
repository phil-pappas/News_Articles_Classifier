His aim is to provide Catholic families with saintly role models who took care to educate their children in the faith: The Martins bore nine children, only five of whom survived. All five became nuns, including the youngest, Therese, at 15.\n News Nation/World Religion Associated Press", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-18T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:06:50.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
