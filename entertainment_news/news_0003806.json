According to The Hollywood Reporter , ABC is teaming with the producers behind the Julia Roberts -starring romantic comedy to adapt it into a half-hour series. Ron Bass (\"Rain Man\"), who penned the 1997 feature film, is set to write the script for the TV adaptation alongside Jessica Amento. The plotline is still scarce, but it is expected to be a sequel instead of a reboot of the original. The TV show will pick up where the movie left off and centers on restaurant critic named Julianne Potter (made famous by Roberts) navigating her life in New York City with best friend George (originally played by Rupert Everett ). \"My Best Friend's Wedding\" movie was also supported by Dermot Mulroney and Cameron Diaz .
