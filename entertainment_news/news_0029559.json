Baylor leads the way, though quarterback Seth Russell's neck injury is a looming concern as the Bears prepare for a difficult November. Next comes TCU, which has been dealing with injuries woes of its own throughout the regular season.\nFollow the road to the 2015 College Football Playoff at The Football Four , our home to rate and debate the nation's best. Utah's slide makes No. 9 Stanford the top-ranked team from the Pac-12 Conference. Stanford wouldn't face the Utes until the Pac-12 title game, but the Cardinal have games against Oregon, California and Notre Dame in November. While other conferences feast on each other — Michigan State plays Ohio State and LSU plays Alabama in the coming weeks — the Cardinal are in prime position to secure a place in the College Football Playoff.\nOnce again, the Re-rank is defined by the parity seen across the top leagues in the Football Bowl Subdivision. Twenty-four teams enter the final stretch of the season with one or fewer losses. The American Athletic Conference alone has three unbeaten teams: No. 11 Memphis, No. 16 Temple and No. 23 Houston. The Owls' quest for perfection faces its toughest test in Saturday night's matchup against Notre Dame.\nNew to the top 25: UCLA and Georgia.\nOut of the top 25: Texas A&M and California.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/03/USATODAY/USATODAY/635768715971618409-football-four-promo2.jpg", "http://footballfour.usatoday.com/", "http://imgur.com/ZJuwJFi.png", "http://archive.azcentral.com/ic/news/projects/css/linkset.css"], "published": "2015-10-26T17:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:50:16.097+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
