The Allies are poised to invade France and finally defeat the German army. But in Walmington-on-Sea morale amongst the Home Guard is low. Their new mission then – to patrol the Dover army base – is a great chance to revive spirits and reputation, that is until glamorous journalist Rose Winters arrives to write about their exploits, setting the pulses racing and putting the local women on red alert. MI5 then discover a radio signal sent direct to Berlin from Walmington-on-Sea. There’s a spy on the loose! The outcome of the war is suddenly at stake, and it falls to our unlikely heroes to stand up and be counted. \nThe cast includes Bill Nighy as Wilson (The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, Love Actually), Catherine Zeta Jones as Rose (Side Effects, Chicago, The Legend of Zorro), Toby Jones as Captain Mainwaring (The Hunger Games, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows), Tom Courtenay as Corporal Jones (Quartet), Michael Gambon as Godfrey (Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, The King’s Speech), Blake Harrison as Pike (The Inbetweeners), Danny Mays as Walker (Atonement), Bill Paterson as Fraser (Miss Potter), Sarah Lancashire (Last Tango in Halifax, Lark Rise to Candleford), Alison Steadman (Gavin & Stacey) , Mark Gatiss (Sherlock, Doctor Who), Annette Crosbie (What We Did on Our Holiday), Felicity Montagu (Bridget Jones’s Diary, Alan Partridge), Julia Foster (Alfie), Holli Dempsey (Derek), Oliver Tobias (Arthur of the Britons) and Emily Atack (The Inbetweeners). \nDad’s Army will be released in cinemas on 5th February 2016.
