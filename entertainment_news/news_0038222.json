The \"Saved by the Bell\" star, 41, filed for divorce from him on Monday, October 19 in Pasadena, California. She cited irreconcilable differences as the reason of their separation. Voorhies also asked judge to deny him spousal support. \"They can remain friends, but it's best they sever their marriage ties,\" her mother Patricia said to PEOPLE about the couple's split. \"Lark is ready to move forward with her life and wishes him well with his life.\" The actress met Green, 32, on Facebook last year. They married in a private ceremony in Las Vegas in April. She said back then, \"We have known it was meant to be for a while now and are so happy we found each other. I look forward to all the wonderful moments and memories we will create together. Thank you so much for all the well wishes and we appreciate them indeed!\" Last June, Voorhies' mother reportedly filed a restraining order against Green. She also accused him of taking advantage of her daughter. \"He's not,\" Voorhies defended her husband in an interview with Entertainment Tonight back then. \"We're selectively together for all the right reasons.\" The actress also denied her mother's claim that she's bipolar, insisting that she's \"always mentally healthy.\" Green, reportedly a music engineer, came to his own defense as well. \"We're the same as any other couple out there that's in love and trying to accomplish business together. It's not a scam or a way to get money,\" he said. As the divorce went public, Green told TMZ that their marriage was difficult and Voorhies' mother was partly to blame. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:53:02.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
