At the back of the beds were bright coloured cushions pinned to the wall. A silhouette of a man holding a woman on the wall highlighted the romance factor, which is so prominent on the show. Asked if the show will get any bolder than before, Dhar told IANS: “I can’t really tell if it’s going to be bolder or will it be tamer, that really depends on the house mates, on how they really project themselves.” \n— BIGG BOSS Newz (@biggbossnewz) October 11, 2015 The “Bigg Boss Nau” bathroom is a distinct French “Moulin Rouge” experience with typical shades of red and blubs ringing the mirror to light up the participants as they prune themselves. The journalists were served breakfast and then the commanding voice of “Big Boss” announced: “Nominations ki prakriya shuru hogayi hai (the process for nominations has begun)”. \n— BIGG BOSS Newz (@biggbossnewz) October 11, 2015 The Yin and Yang pools punctuate the gardens, with lounging bed for sun-bathers. The balcony overlooks a lush green garden, with a purpose of accentuating courtship among the attending couples, while the living room contained a purple sofa, multi-coloured cushions and shaded chandeliers facing toward the “Me TV”, a major prop in the show. The dining area stretched to an open kitchen but the most interesting part was the 14 multi-coloured seats attached to each other in pairs. \n— BIGG BOSS Newz (@biggbossnewz) October 11, 2015 The audiences must have picked up clues over the contestants being paired up from the promos.
