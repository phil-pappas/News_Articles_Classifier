There were tales of how his grandfather stood side-by-side with Mahatma Gandhi during the struggles of the Indian independence movement in British-ruled India. And there were the stories of how as a United Nations diplomat, John Barnabas worked with Haile Selassie to help decolonize and build a new Ethiopian government after the Italian occupation ended in 1941.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nFrankel vows to 'clean up county'\n\"He died before I was born, and I never met him, but when you hear these stories from your family and throughout your early years, they're inspiring,\" said Rajesh Barnabas, 39, of Brighton. \"And with all that, one thing you're not going to settle for is status quo politics when you get older. You're going to look for political injustices and try to live up to that ideal. He has very big shoulders to stand on.\"\nRunning as the Green Party candidate in November's Monroe County executive race, Barnabas knows his chances of winning are slim. But, as the Green Party of Monroe County's website notes, sometimes running for office isn't really about winning: It's about getting people talking about things that aren't getting discussed in the usual course of politics.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nDinolfo say she'll be a problem solver\nAnd that's something Barnabas is well-suited to do, say friends and mentors.\nDuring his time as a social studies teacher with the City School District in the early 2000s, Barnabas struck up a friendship with well-known local educator and activist Howard Eagle. As Barnabas moved into his current job as a producer/director with Rochester Community Television, he continued his relationship with Eagle, who hosts the weekly local news program What's Hot on RCTV-15.\nBuy Photo Rajesh Barnabas watches as students from School 9 practice a segment of their news show. (Photo: TINA MACINTYRE-YEE/@tyee23/staff photographer)\n\"Rajesh is an extremely bright young man, idealistic and sharp,\" said Eagle. \"I'm glad he's running for county executive and think he will bring a perspective that's fundamentally different than what (Cheryl) Dinolfo or (Sandy) Frankel bring and he will be able to raise issues that otherwise would not be raised around education, poverty, housing and health care.\"\nHe said Barnabas is \"the people's candidate\" and is using his platform to \"highlight issues and concerns many people who are voiceless here don't get a chance to raise.\"\nJennifer Bannister, development and collaborations director with Teen Empowerment in Rochester, has known Barnabas since the mid-2000s. She said he's committed to working in the trenches for social justice and helping young people understand bigger issues and become involved.\n\"A lot of times, people feel removed from the issues until there's an election and it becomes a horse race,\" she said. \"But Rajesh has been committed over time to digging in deep and helping young people understand what's happening in the world and helping them figure out how to figure it out for themselves.\"\nTo that end, Barnabas cites a list of community involvement that is atypical to the usual candidates fielded by Republicans and Democrats in our local races. Instead of Rotary or Lions Club or Chamber of Commerce involvement, Barnabas touts his involvement with student protests against the Iraq War, work with the Occupy movement, Rochester Against War, the Rochester International Socialist Organization , and progressive causes including Black Lives Matter, Fight for 15 and Take Back the Land.\n\"What I've learned from my activism? People blame political apathy out there among young people for the lack of involvement, but it's not really apathy, it's just bad organizing at this point,\" Barnabas said. \"We just need our generation and younger generations to get better at organizing together and I really think that is happening. I see what is happening here with Black Lives Matter, and Take Back the Land and hope we will push the envelope here and push these ideas into the bigger political arena.\"\nHere are some of those ideas:\nCarbon police\nAddressing issues of racial inequality in the criminal justice system, Barnabas said we need to move away from the \"drug war\" and move toward a solution that does away with disparities in arrest and incarceration rates between black people and white people.\nReferencing Michelle Alexander's best-selling book The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness , Barnabas said the imprisonment of high numbers of black men and women is an American crisis, creating a \"different criminal justice system for different races, where we're living in an American caste system.\" He pointed his finger at the drug war, which he said is \"increasing violence in the street, adding more tension to already-stressed socio-economics.\"\nHe called for more restorative justice, focusing on rehabilitation and treatment rather than punishment.\n\"Society needs to determine how it's going to take its losses, and if we treat drug use medically and preventatively, that has to be a better way than incarcerating one out of every eight young black men,\" he said.\nBuy Photo Rajesh Barnabas, producer-director at Rochester Community Television, talks with School 9 teacher Alba Pacheco after she and three students finished doing their MLK Kids News program at RCTV. (Photo: TINA MACINTYRE-YEE/@tyee23/staff photographer)\nHow this relates to the office of county executive? Barnabas said he'd redirect some resources of the Monroe County Sheriff's Office away from \"overpolicing\" and toward serving as \"watchdogs of the environment, helping build a cleaner local, carbon-free economy in Rochester rather than feeding people into the prison-industrial complex.\"\nCountywide schools\nHaving 18 school districts in Monroe County wastes money on duplicated administrations and helps ensure economic and racial segregation remains entrenched in the education system, said Barnabas. As county executive, he'd advocate for a county system, broken into quadrants.\n\"At the every least, I'd like to see a referendum where the greater Rochester community can weigh in,\" he said, acknowledging that there has been previous strong resistance to such an idea. \"I think if we put a referendum up in a presidential election year, we would have a better look at how the whole county feels about this.\"\nHe noted recent studies that show New York, and the Rochester area, have some of the most segregated school systems in the nation.\n\"When poverty and low achievement is diluted, there are far more examples of success,\" he said. \"There is a measured positive effect on all grades.\"\nAs an additional benefit, a county school system would break up the existing \"cultural imperialism\" that has some 85 percent of Rochester teachers living outside the district where they work.\n\"They have to have skin in the game,\" he said. \"This regional metro quadrant system would have more teachers sending their own kids to the school districts they're teaching in, so you have more buy-in from the teachers.\"\nGreener Rochester\nOther ideas include \"some wild public works projects,\" including a botanical garden in the defunct Medley Centre mall in Irondequoit to serve as a respite for residents weary of winter weather; buying out local service from Rochester Gas & Electric in order to create a municipal utility company to save residents money on their electricity and to help move forward with ambitious projects to become a fully sustainable, zero-carbon community; initiating new mass transit including high-speed trains, trams and maybe even a Hyperloop like Elon Musk has proposed in California. He'd also like to transform the abandoned Rochester subway beds into an \"underground bicycle superhighway.\"\nStill, while his some of his ideas may seem fantastical, Barnabas is realistic about his chances.\n\"I know there are insurmountable odds,\" he said. \"But you've got to start somewhere, so if you campaign, you need to raise issues that aren't normally going to be talked about. But honestly, I think we need systemic change, I've worked with the Rochester International Socialist Organization and we believe in a more equitable society and I think the two major parties are colluding to keep the status quo and that's why we have such low turnout.\n\"People don't think voting will actually change the system, and I want to energize populations who don't typically pay attention to political topics.\"\nMCDERMOT@Gannett.com\nRajesh Barnabas\nAge: 39.\nLives in: Brighton.\nHometown: Webster.\nProfessional background: Teacher, Rochester School District 2003 to 2011.\nProducer/director, Rochester Community Television, 2011 to present.\nEducation: State University College at Geneseo, bachelor's degree in political science, 1998.\nNazareth College, master's degree in education with a concentration in technology, 2012.\nOther experience: Assisted with political campaigns for Bill Cook for Congress in 1998, Carole Barnabas for Webster Town Board in 2001 and others.\nFamily: Married to Erica Bryant, columnist for the Democrat and Chronicle ; two children.\nParty lines: Barnabas will appear on the Green party line.\nEndorsements: Barnabas said he has support from several groups who do not make formal endorsements.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/22/Rochester/Rochester/635811083231143960-TY-102215-BARNABAS-B.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7858ef7009ade8211afb6cc4c613c36a687b8ce2/c=152-0-2118-1478&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/22/Rochester/Rochester/635811083231143960-TY-102215-BARNABAS-B.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8b53c9b014dd71438f6334a94d420011b5f6448c/c=94-0-493-399/local/-/media/2015/10/19/Rochester/Rochester/635808775399169169-JW-Dinolfo-101715-News-A.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/18b6850ecd1e7c167848c1a095f3c62acd352cdf/r=500x341/local/-/media/2015/10/22/Rochester/Rochester/635811083231143960-TY-102215-BARNABAS-B.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dccf0cd74bc8367ce0b8b4c3e7d97048960e2c43/c=361-0-2361-2000/local/-/media/2015/10/15/Rochester/Rochester/635805159051263453-LP-Sandy-Frankel-D-101515-Metro.JPG", "http://rochesteriso.blogspot.com/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/22/Rochester/Rochester/635811083252828099-TY-102215-BARNABAS-A.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a57cb87523081f89514984f1cf4f0c13e0b2f571/r=500x338/local/-/media/2015/10/22/Rochester/Rochester/635811083252828099-TY-102215-BARNABAS-A.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/39cbd610e1dbc49a336f33efcdedfdb00509b372/c=109-0-2057-1465&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/22/Rochester/Rochester/635811083252828099-TY-102215-BARNABAS-A.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-25T06:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:51:24.292+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
