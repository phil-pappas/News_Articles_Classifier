She says with each step, Priyanka is setting a \"new benchmark\" for Indian actors.\n\nParineeti Chopra with sister Priyanka Chopra \n\"Oh my god, how do you do it every time! So proud of you mimi didi! Love you amazing#QUANTICO GUYS!@priyankachopra,\" Parineeti tweeted.\nAfter dominating the Indian film industry, Priyanka turned to the West and emerged as a singer with hit singles like 'Exotic', and now she has made inroads in to the small screen space with action-thriller series 'Quantico'.\nThe former beauty queen plays an FBI agent, whose identity is shrouded by suspicion of being a terrorist.\nParineeti, who forayed into Bollywood with a supporting role in the 2011 romantic comedy 'Ladies vs Ricky Bahl', noted that Priyanka's hard work is a source of inspiration for all.\n\"What you have achieved is unimaginable but I also know that only you could do it! So proud of you! #Quantico @priyankachopra. There is a new benchmark set for all of us. Why do you make us work so hard! Huh??? Hahahaha. Muuua @priyankachopra,\" she shared further.\nParineeti features in a multi-starrer web-series 'Man's World', made in support of UN Global Goals for Sustainable Development campaign. The series went live on the Y-Films channel on YouTube on September 29.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T11:02:00.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
