The man behind the critically-acclaimed BBC crime series has a tough gig with this one, as studio Fox is hoping for a franchise along the lines of the Planet of the Apes series. © Rex Features / Moviestore CollectionKurt Russell as Snake Plissken in the original Escape from New York (1981) The Hollywood Reporter announced the news to a chorus of genuinely bemused fans who'd initially dismissed the remake, but with Cross on board, it might be time for a reappraisal. No director has been attached to the project so far, and so no actor, but fingers crossed that Loofah himself, Idris Elba, gets at least a cameo. © BBCIdris Elba's Luther will return for two special episodes later this year. Or maybe he should play the lead role, Snake Plissken, originally brought to life by Kurt Russell, eyepatch and all. Plissken is the man tasked with rescuing the President of the United States after Air Force One crashes on Manhattan, which has - of course - been transformed into a maximum security prison.Still very much in the planning (and writing) stages, the Escape From New York remake has no officially-announced release date.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:02:55.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
