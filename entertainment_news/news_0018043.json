The Apprentice candidates trawl the continent for a bargain in latest task 100 snails, s'il vous plait! The Apprentice candidates trawl the continent for a bargain in latest task \nPress Association 2014 / / National Entertainment News Share \nThe Apprentice candidates all claim to have a nose for business – but they’ll have to prove they can sniff out a bargain as they shovel manure and purchase pongy cheese in their latest task. \nA lazy day for the candidates is interrupted by a call from Lord Sugar telling them to pack a bag and join him in the wartime tunnels underneath Dover Castle for a cross-Channel challenge. Mergim Butaja searches for snails (Boundless/BBC) \nSticking with girls vs boys, Lord Sugar gives the teams 10 hours to find nine items, including 100 snails and Leavers lace, a foreign item to the two teams. \nHalf start their search on the Kent coast, while the self-proclaimed linguists set sail to France to bag a bargain on the Continent, including PMs Vana Koutsomitis and Joseph Valente. \nIt’s not long before promises of fluent French trip up the boys’ team when one candidate leads them in the wrong direction and Richard Woods cheeses off a shop owner as he tries to haggle for Maroilles. Richard Woods can’t woo cheap cheese out of this shop owner (Boundless/BBC) \nLittle do they know that aide Claude Littner is well-versed in the language of love and can catch out the liars. \nBoth teams put aside their pride and designer suits to shovel manure instead of purchasing it, but Elle Stevenson kicks up a stink when she thinks a cow is giving her the evil eye. Natalie Dean flutters her eyelashes for champagne flutes (Boundless/BBC) \nFor the girls, a case of a missing Louis Philippe mirror and multiple trips to the same shop for a crucial item see tempers flare. \nAnd there’s more drama before the White Cliffs are in sight with confusion over an inflatable boat. Run, Ruth, run! (Boundless/BBC) \nBack in the boardroom, Lord Sugar will reveal which team’s negotiation skills got them the best deal and it’s au revoir to one unlucky candidate.
