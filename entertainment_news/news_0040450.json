(Elizabeth Williams via AP)\nA turncoat mobster is telling the inside story of a historic heist immortalized in the hit Mafia movie \"Goodfellas.\"\nGaspar Valenti testified on Tuesday at the federal trial of an aging gangster charged in the $6 million Lufthansa robbery in 1978.\nValenti told a Brooklyn jury he was a mob associate when defendant Vincent Asaro asked him to join a robbery crew for an armed holdup at a cargo terminal at Kennedy Airport.\nHe testified that it was believed there was $2 million at the terminal.
