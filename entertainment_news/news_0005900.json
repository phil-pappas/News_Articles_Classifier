Yep, Otter, as in the sea creature. She told the \"Today\" show why she and husband Jacob Pechenik picked the unique combo. \"We just really liked the name Elsie, and then we both love otters; they're very sweet, and they're also smart.\" It's not like Elsie Otter is the only famous kid with a unique moniker: Hide Caption 1 of 19 19 photos: Celebrity baby names: The best of the unique Lil Kim reportedly welcomed a baby girl on June 9, 2014, and chose to name her new arrival Royal Reign. If nothing else, it's an appropriately regal name for \"Lil Kim the Queen Bee's\" first-born. Hide Caption 2 of 19 19 photos: Celebrity baby names: The best of the unique Kate Winslet did not take our baby name suggestion for her newborn son with husband Ned Rocknroll. Instead of christening the infant \"Long Live\" -- which we thought would go perfectlywith Ned's last name -- the 38-year-old actress elected to name her baby boy Bear Blaze Winslet . Hide Caption 3 of 19 19 photos: Celebrity baby names: The best of the unique Soleil Moon Frye is raising a second generation of uniquely named kids. The former \"Punky Brewster\" star welcomed her third child, a boy, on February 10, 2014, and revealed on her website that she named her son Lyric Sonny Roads Goldberg. Lyric's two older sisters are Poet Sienna Rose and Jagger Joseph Blue. Hide Caption 4 of 19 19 photos: Celebrity baby names: The best of the unique Considering that Stacy Ann Ferguson legally changed her first name to her stage moniker, Fergie, we shouldn't be surprised that she picked a unique name for her first child. Her husband, Josh Duhamel, said before their baby's August 29, 2013, arrival that their choice was different and potentially rock-inspired: The new parents settled on Axl Jack. Hide Caption 5 of 19 19 photos: Celebrity baby names: The best of the unique Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are the proud parents of a girl named North. Full name: North West. Yep. Hide Caption 6 of 19 19 photos: Celebrity baby names: The best of the unique Holly Madison knew she was going to get criticism for naming her daughter, born in March 2013, Rainbow Aurora. So she explained when she revealed her choice that she intentionally wanted something different. \"Growing up, there was a girl in my school named Rainbow, and I was so envious of that name,\" Madison told E! . \"I thought it was so pretty and unique!\" Hide Caption 7 of 19 19 photos: Celebrity baby names: The best of the unique Compared with other names on this list, the ones Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon picked -- Monroe and Moroccan -- are pretty tame. Hey, at least they're spelled correctly! But when the now-split couple announced in May 2011 that their newborn twins were named after Marilyn Monroe and a Moroccan-themed room in Carey's New York home, it did seem a little strange. Hide Caption 8 of 19 19 photos: Celebrity baby names: The best of the unique Poppy Honey Rosie, Daisy Boo Pamela, Petal Blossom Rainbow and Buddy Bear Maurice. Those are the names chef Jamie Oliver and his wife, Jools, chose for their four children, seen here when the couple's son, Buddy, was a baby in September 2010. Hide Caption 9 of 19 19 photos: Celebrity baby names: The best of the unique Jay-Z and Beyonc√© wanted a name so unique for their firstborn daughter that they even tried to trademark it : Blue Ivy. They ended up losing their bid, as a Boston wedding planner already has a business by the name of Blue Ivy, and she'd petitioned to trademark it as well. \"I was really blatantly shocked,\" the entrepreneur said at the time. \"I didn't think it was true, because nobody names their daughter Blue Ivy.\" Hide Caption 10 of 19 19 photos: Celebrity baby names: The best of the unique Gwyneth Paltrow's two kids are two of the most famous celebrity offspring thanks to their offbeat names. Moses is named after a song Paltrow's former husband, Coldplay's Chris Martin, wrote for her, while Apple's name was chosen because it \"sounded so lovely and clean.\" Hide Caption 11 of 19 19 photos: Celebrity baby names: The best of the unique In Jermajesty's family, it's his sibling Jeremy who's the odd man out. Jermaine Jackson's other son's name is Jaafar, who's seen here on the right. Jermajesty, left, fits right in. Hide Caption 12 of 19 19 photos: Celebrity baby names: The best of the unique We suppose magician Penn Jillette, seen here with his family and magic partner Teller in April 2013, really wanted magical names for his kids. His son's name, Zolten, is actually his wife, Emily's, maiden name, while his daughter's name is more creative: Moxie Crimefighter. \"I love that it's a purely American word ... and I love that it stands for old-fashioned spunk and energy,\" Penn said in 2007. Hide Caption 13 of 19 19 photos: Celebrity baby names: The best of the unique Surely, Nicolas Cage is first in line to see all the Superman movies. We can only guess that his love for the superhero is what led to him bestowing Superman's Kryptonian name, Kal-El, on his son. Hide Caption 14 of 19 19 photos: Celebrity baby names: The best of the unique Frank Zappa's brood all have funky names, such as Dweezil, Ahmet Emuukha Rodan and Diva Thin Muffin Pigeen. But for us, Moon Unit, seen here with Lou Reed in 1995, will always take the cake. Hide Caption 15 of 19 19 photos: Celebrity baby names: The best of the unique At least Rachel Griffiths didn't settle on \"Guitar.\" That doesn't roll off the tongue quite as well as the name she gave her son, seen here in 2007, Banjo. Hide Caption 16 of 19 19 photos: Celebrity baby names: The best of the unique With one son named Kingston, Gwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale had to up the ante with their second son, who was born in 2008. The inspiration behind the name Zuma Nesta Rock has been heavily dissected, with most agreeing that Zuma is a nod to Zuma Beach in Malibu. The pair's third son was gifted with the name Apollo. Hide Caption 17 of 19 19 photos: Celebrity baby names: The best of the unique Alicia Silverstone and husband Christopher Jarecki decided on Bear Blu when they welcomed their son in May 2011 . Not everyone was a fan: The actress was tied with Mariah Carey for the top spot on BabyNames.com's worst celebrity baby name of 2012. Hide Caption 18 of 19 19 photos: Celebrity baby names: The best of the unique Rob Morrow's daughter Tu is 12 years older than Kanye West's daughter with Kim Kardashian, but we have a feeling they could become best friends.
