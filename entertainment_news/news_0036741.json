His blood pressure had fallen to 60/40 and he needed frequent dialysis. When someone is in such a critical condition, you start to wonder if you will see that person hale and hearty again. Ten minutes past 4 pm, doctors broke the sad news to us. We had lost him.\nAlso read: Ravindra Jain - A tribute to the Music Maestro \n\nAnup Jalota recalls how veteran music composer Ravindra Jain always had a smile on his face and a quip on his tongue. File pic  \nWe have lost a unique musician and a beautiful writer and singer. No one can ever take his place. He was a sweet, humble man who always wore a smile. He was someone who would invite you home for lunch as soon as you met him. Whenever we met, he would crack jokes or recite shayaris he had penned. His style of working was also quite different; he would carry out thorough research for his writing and composition. Imagine a blind man visualising something and writing beautiful lines about it.\nAlso read: Veteran music composer Ravindra Jain passes away \nI had known Jainji since childhood. Not many know that my father, Purushottam Jalota, was one of his inspirations. He respected my father a lot and would attend his concerts.\nI had worked with him in films like Pyaar Ka Sawan (1991) and Chintamani Surdas (1998), in which I lent my voice to the male leads. He had also composed many bhajans and I had sung a devotional number called Ram Janmbhumi for his music label, RJ Music.\nMusical legend \nI remember we were in Delhi for a show, where we spotted Raj Kapoor there. After Jainji made him listen to the song Ek Radha, Ek Mira, Kapoor developed Ram Teri Ganga Maili (1985). This was a unique example of lyrics paving the way for a film.\nHe discovered several talented singers including like Yesudas, Suresh Wadkar, Aarti Mukherji and Jaspal Singh. We were thrilled when the Padma Shri was conferred on him last year.\nFor all the good work he has done and all the respect that he has earned, I am certain that a billion prayers will reach God for his soul to rest in peace.\n(As told to Anirban Das) \n\nComposer Ravindra Jain breathed his last at Lilavati \nVeteran music director Ravindra Jain passed away at the Mumbai hospital yesterday, following multiple organ failure. The 71-year-old was suffering from a urinary infection that caused a problem in his kidney. A few days ago, he was airlifted to Lilavati Hospital in Bandra, where he was put on ventilator support. Jain overcame blindness to become one of Bollywood’s most successful composers, and gave music for films like Chor Machaye Shor, Geet Gaata Chal in the ‘70s. He is survived by his wife Divya and son Ayush.\n— Inputs by Agencies", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:00:45.273+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
