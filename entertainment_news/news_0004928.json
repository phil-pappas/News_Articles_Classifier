In Vogue 's latest issue in which she graces the cover with a beachy shoot, the actress-turned-director explains why she looks forward to turning 50. \"I feel grounded as a woman,\" the mother of six says in her cover story. \"I know others do too. Both of the women in my family, my mother and my grandmother started dying in their 40s. I'm 40. I can't wait to hit 50 and know I made it.\" A photo posted by Vogue (@voguemagazine) on Oct 16, 2015 at 8:12am PDT Jolie also talks about her double mastectomy surgeries. \"It's hard. They are not easy surgeries. The ovaries are an easy surgery, but the hormone changes,\" she says, \"interesting. We did joke that I had my Monday edit. Tuesday surgery. Wednesday go into menopause. Thursday come back to edit, a little funky with my steps.\" She and her husband, Brad Pitt , have just finished filming a movie together. In \" By the Sea \", they play a married couple who is going through a hard time. \"It's not autobiographical,\" she says of the film. \"Brad and I have our issues, but if the characters were even remotely close to our problems we couldn't have made the film ... As artists we wanted something that took us out of our comfort zones. Just being raw actors. It's not the safest idea. But life is short.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T19:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:49:23.641+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
