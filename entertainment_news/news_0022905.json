(UPI) -- A man visiting his sick father in Arizona said a night of watching football took a bizarre turn when a hawk and falcon fought over a dove in the living room.\nTrent Davis said he was visiting his father in Cave Creek, Ariz., Sunday and he was helping the older man, who has cancer, out of bed when he heard a loud noise from the living room.\n\"I finished what I was doing there, came back in here and then right here in this corner of the room there was a falcon,\" Davis told KPNX-TV. And a big eagle, which I can show pictures of. In between was a dove or something that had flown in and they were fighting over it in the living room.\nThe Maricopa County Sheriff's Office said the animal Davis identified as an eagle appears to have actually been a hawk.\nDavis, who said the birds must have entered through an open door, attempted to shoo the birds out with a broom.\n\"I put on a leather jacket and sweat pants and flip flops and got a broom,\" Davis said. The eagle did its full on defense stance and kind of flew at me with the feet out like this so I kind of ran away like any smart person would.\nDavis called 911 and deputies soon arrived to capture the birds of prey in bedsheets and release them outside.\n\"The one night I'm supposed to watch my dad and then a hawk attacks my dad, I'm gonna be in trouble with my mom,\" Davis joked.\nA Missouri man faced a similar challenge in February of this year when a red-tailed hawk crashed through his bedroom window.\nDrew Arnold, 23, of Kansas City, said the bird crashed \"through two panes of glass\" and destroyed my bedroom.\nAn animal control officer removed the exhausted hawk from Arnold's home, but not before he caught an image of the hawk's \"smile\" on camera.\nCopyright 2015 by United Press International Share Comment", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1740280&h=Hawk%2C+falcon+duel+over+dove+in+Arizona+living+room", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1740280&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1740280"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:25:52.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
