So I don't want to reveal too much about what happens.\nrelated advertisement \"Room\"\n★ ★ ★ ★\nStarring: Brie Larson, Jacob Tremblay, Joan Allen, William H. Macy\nDirected by: Lenny Abrahamson\nOther: An A-24 release. Opens at the River East 21 and Century Centre theaters in Chicago, plus the Evanston Century 12. Rated R for language. 113 minutes I came to \"Room\" utterly cold without reading Emma Donoghue's popular 2010 novel, and without viewing a single trailer or commercial for it. So, its plot-turns bowled me over. Its ultimate, optimistic testimonial to the resilience of the human spirit, the necessity of hope and a young mother's courage pumped the story with purpose.\n\"Room\" begins as a mystery. Slowly, it reveals itself to be a story of survival, first physical, then emotional and psychological.\nThe versatile actress Brie Larson plays Joy, the mother of 5-year-old Jack, played by an impressively unaffected actor named Jacob Tremblay. Jack and Joy live in a 10-by-10 room with an old television set, a stove, a single skylight and a wardrobe, where Jack sleeps.\nEvery day Joy leads them in exercise. She limits his TV time and makes sure they read books together. They seem to live completely normal lives. But why do they never leave this room?\nDonoghue's own screenplay includes subtle clues: Jack possesses long, flowing hair, suggesting he's never had a haircut. The kitchen knives Joy uses have their sharp tips broken off. Why?\nA man Joy calls \"Old Nick\" (Sean Bridgers) comes into the room at night after Jack has gone to bed. He can still hear the man talking and taking Joy to bed. Who is he?\nThis much I can reveal about the audacious \"Room.\" It gives us a nail-biter of an action sequence, a harrowing account that pushes up pulse rates and blood pressures.\nThen, just when most movies like this one would end, \"Room\" begins a second tale of survival, now with Joan Allen and William H. Macy playing Joy's divorced parents.\nAbrahamson, who directed the quirky indie drama \"Frank,\" infuses this daring drama with tension and urgency, even through the claustrophobic set for the first 50 minutes.\nLarson, looking dowdy without cosmetics or a star's ego, is a walking lightning rod for our sympathy, especially as it becomes clear that her world, her room, revolves around her love for Jack.\nViewers who like neatly packaged stories and familiar themes will probably not appreciate the open questions raised in \"Room.\" (A TV reporter asks Joy if she did what was best for Jack, or for herself?)\nThis stands as bold and thoughtful work, offering small insights instead of sweeping discoveries, modest victories in lieu of easy catharsis. It has answers, but not the easy ones.\nCall it a \"Room\" with a viewpoint.\n Life & Entertainment Movies Video", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-21T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:51:22.227+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
