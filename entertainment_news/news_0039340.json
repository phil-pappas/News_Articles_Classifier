According to one man, what they, and many others do not know, is that they are being fed a lie.\nThe story we know, that Christopher Columbus was a peasant of Italian origin, has been proven patently false. In fact, many supposed facts about his life, voyage and conquest, have been painted in an all-too flattering light. While the doctored story lasted for around 500 years, the truth was revealed after many years of investigation.\nInternationally renowned and award-winning researcher, Manuel Rosa , plans to reveal secrets about the origins of Columbus, and much more during his upcoming lecture at Quinnipiac University .\nRosa, a Luso-American historian born in Pico Island , Azores, has dedicated his life to discovering the truth about this so-called hero explorer. In 1991, Mr. Rosa began a scientific investigation of the life of Christopher Columbus and was the only Portuguese historian involved with DNA studies of Columbus' bones at the University of Granada in Spain .\nRosa is the published author of the book, \"The Columbus Mystery Revealed,\"( Lisbon , 2006) as well as many research papers dedicated to this subject. His latest book \"COLÃ“N. La historia nunca contada\" (COLUMBUS. The Untold story) has been published in several European countries and seeks US publication.\nFind out what caused James T. McDonough, Jr. , Ph.D. Professor at St. Joseph's University to exclaim, \"Another nutty conspiracy theory! That's what I first supposed. I now believe that Christopher Columbus is guilty of a huge fraud carried out over two decades.\"\nThe lecture \" New Evidence Shows Columbus Was Not Italian But Polish \" will be held at the main campus of Quinnipiac University , at the Carl Hansen Student Center: Room 225, on October 8th, 2015 at 12:00 pm .\nCome learn things about Christopher Columbus that the textbooks never mentioned!\nContact information mr@1942.us.com\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-evidence-proves-history-lied-about-christopher-columbus-presented-by-author-and-researcher-manuel-rosa-in-upcoming-lecture-at-quinnipiac-university-300152531.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://1492.us.com/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=NY16801&Transmission_Id=201510011000PR_NEWS_USPR_____NY16801&DateId=20151001", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-evidence-proves-history-lied-about-christopher-columbus-presented-by-author-and-researcher-manuel-rosa-in-upcoming-lecture-at-quinnipiac-university-300152531.html"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T19:13:38.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
