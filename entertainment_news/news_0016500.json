Whether it be a zombie apocalypse, an environmental meltdown, or nuclear war, that dread occasion can be put to great use by writers and filmmakers.\nThat includes Robert C. O'Brien, whose posthumously published sci-fi novel, \"Z for Zachariah,\" has been adapted into a lean, tight, killer character study by \"Compliance\" director Craig Zobel. Mildly reminiscent of Cormac McCarthy's \"The Road\" and its 2009 film adaptation, the stirring \"Z for Zachariah\" is about three lonely souls trying to survive in a world devoid of other people.\nAustralian Margot Robbie (\"Focus,\" \"The Wolf of Wall Street\") turns in a rare, incandescent performance as Ann Burden, a farm gal who believes she and her dog, Pharaoh, are the only survivors of a nuclear holocaust that has wiped out North America -- and as far as we can tell, the rest of the globe.\nFilled with religious imagery and biblical references -- Ann lives quite literally in the shadow of a chapel her dad built with his own hands -- Zobel's film begins to build momentum when another person appears in the shape of the polite, if tense, John Loomis (Chiwetel Ejiofor).\nBut the pair, who work slowly, deliberately to become a romantic couple, soon lose exclusive use of their Eden when Caleb (Chris Pine) shows up. Oh, he's trouble. Big trouble.
