But Puth's reverence for the late R&B great extends far beyond using Gaye's name as a sexy come-on. Here, Puth shares some Gaye favorites with USA TODAY.\nStubborn Kind of Fellow : The background vocalists do call and response and outline the chords. The voices are the main instruments.\nHow Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You) : Believe it or not, the tambourine adds a lot to this. The song wouldn't be the same without it. I'm a producer nerd.\nAin't Nothing Like the Real Thing : I love how this song starts off with the chorus. It hits you with the hook right at the beginning. Super catchy.\nYou're All I Need to Get By : Love the chords in this song.\nWhat's Going On : His vocal performance still gives me chills when I hear this song.\nMercy Mercy Me (The Ecology) : This record starts like it's going in one direction then modulates into E major, changing the vibe completely.\nYour Precious Love : I love how Marvin and Tammi's voices blend together.\nLet's Get It On : It's obvious. Songs about sex = win.\nSexual Healing : He pioneered using an 808 as a drum loop that started a trend for so many future records.\nMy Love Is Waiting : This is the last song on Marvin Gaye's last album before he passed away. It's a special closing to a beautiful career.\nListen to Puth's playlist here:\n6 CONNECT 19 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1RCAURn TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3d6091280973338c4358423db021783c62a847a6/c=173-0-2828-1996&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798324871657458-GTY-489367206-76098440.JPG", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RCAURn&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/521cd80a4fb9f1f1edf37d025629b379daee5bba/r=500x332/local/-/media/2015/10/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798324871657458-GTY-489367206-76098440.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798324871657458-GTY-489367206-76098440.JPG", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igNVdlXhKcI", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RCAURn&text=Playlist%3A%20Charlie%20Puth%27s%20Marvin%20Gaye%20favorites&via=usatoday", "http://usat.ly/1RCAURn"], "published": "2015-10-12T20:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:45:52.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
