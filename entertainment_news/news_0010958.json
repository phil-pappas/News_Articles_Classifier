Whiskey or tequila or whatever. I'll kind of huddle up with them and decide what key works the best,\" Reiners said. \nTransposing songs into the appropriate key and figuring out arrangements on the spot are some of the challenges of performing live karaoke, Reiners said. \n\"A lot of the stuff we do off the top of our heads. Sometimes you'll have a gal who'll pick a song that's made famous by a male singer. They're not going to be able to sing that song in the original key,\" Reiners said. \nAs for the available song choices, The Y'all Stars play \"a lot of Hank, Loretta, Dolly, Johnny,\" Reiners said. \"We might do a Beatles tune, we might do a Doors number. We try to include whoever is in the room. We try to accommodate the prevailing taste of whoever's there.\" \nThe Shop manager Krystal Kay Cortez, who hails from Texas, said the goal of the karaoke night is to bring \"a bit of the South to Brooklyn.\" \n\"If you think of country, you might think of boring and slow songs. But live karaoke brings a bit of life to it. We're trying to bring that rowdiness back,\" Cortez said. \nThe live karaoke events will run from 9 p.m. to midnight and will feature special deals on drinks. There is no cover charge.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T14:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:56:54.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
