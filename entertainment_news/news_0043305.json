Disney on Ice: 100 Years of Magic has multiple shows a day through the weekend. Atlanta Pride is organizing three marches and parades that will shut down streets in the downtown area. The largest of these events, the Atlanta Pride Parade, is Sunday afternoon. It starts at exactly the same time as the kickoff to the Atlanta Falcons game with the Washington Redskins. \nThe Atlanta Pride Parade route (Photo: 11Alive News) \nAtlanta Pride organizers have been meeting with city leaders about traffic plans. Street closures for the parade will start at 10:00 a.m. on Sunday. It's a rolling closure following the route through downtown and Midtown. As part of those meetings, Pride leaders promised to urge participants and spectators to ride MARTA and avoid the congested area. There will also be signs along the interstate urging traffic for the Georgia Dome and Phillips Arena NOT to take the Williams Street exit. Guide to Pride 2015 \nDisney on Ice ticket-holders include a lot of customers outside of MARTA's footprint. Historically, most of them drive themselves and park near the event. The costume-clad kids and their parents fill nearby surface lots and sidewalks on their way to the event.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T20:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:24:15.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
