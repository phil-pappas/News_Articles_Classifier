Okay I know what you’re thinking? “Bah—cockamamie conspiracy theory.” Maybe so, maybe so… But think about it: in the past it was known that gods transferred technological, cultural, and spiritual upgrades to humans, by becoming humans themselves. Demons too: Hitler, Stalin (duh)—so why not aliens? \n“That’s so dumb” you say. Yes, but… aliens are cold-blooded, they like to abduct and probe humans, see, and so on the basis of all that, given how Jobs cold-bloodedly disowned his own daughter, manipulated people (in his own words: “I’m indifferent to whether people dislike me”) and refused to relinquish even a tiny bit of the thunder he wrested from Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, and did more to advance alien technology than anyone else on earth, Steve Jobs… could’ve been an alien. Just sayin’. Michael Fassbender portrays the pioneering founder of Apple in “Steve Jobs”, directed by Academy Award® winner Danny Boyle and written by Academy Award® winner Aaron Sorkin. Set backstage in the minutes before three iconic product launches spanning Jobs’ career—beginning with the Macintosh in 1984, and ending with the unveiling of the iMac in 1998—the film takes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution to paint an intimate portrait of the brilliant man at its epicenter. (Universal Pictures/Universal Studios) \nOkay maybe he didn’t advance technology more than Bill Gates. Who here is prepared to argue that Bill Gates isn’t an alien? Aliens are among us. We know this. The government tells us so… Jobs saw himself as the conductor of the whiz-bang inventors and cyber-technician team. \nAnd that’s definitely the reason they got Michael Fassbender to play Steve Jobs; because Fassbender had successfully portrayed an android in “Prometheus.” See—you didn’t think about that. This is why you read my reviews. You can’t get this stuff anywhere else. Steve Jobs the Movie \n“Steve Jobs” is basically a three-act play, about three revolutionary San Francisco-based cyber-product launches: the happy-face Macintosh personal computer in ’84, the black-box NeXT computer in ’88, and the tangerine and aqua bubbly iMac in ’98. These “acts” play like a string of movie trailers. \nExacerbating the trailer effect is the fact that there’s too much script from Aaron Sorkin. Having to volley lines back and forth top-speed, like a ping-pong match with no pauses to listen and visually pick up on other actor’s expressions, is one of the greatest squelchers of joy in the profession of acting. (L–R) Andy Hertzfeld ((Michael Stuhlbarg), Steve Jobs (Michael Fassbender) and Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet) in “Steve Jobs”, directed by Academy Award® winner Danny Boyle. (François Duhamel/Universal Studios) \nThis majority of time spent prepping for curtain call makes “Steve Jobs” very similar to the backstage shenanigans of “Birdman;” lots of hectic running around, last minute snags, and threats of “Make it happen, or else!” before show-time. \nLayered over the techno-glitch navigation and Jobs’s minion’s flop-sweat, are variations on Scrooge-like themes, such as the two gentlemen from the poorhouse requesting donations, Bob Cratchit asking for family time, and Scrooge’s nephew asking him to Christmas dinner—only to be back-handed in the face with extreme Jobs-coldness. Scrooge was all about the job. So was Jobs. ‘Let a Woman in Your Life’ \nBackstage, Jobs’s high school girlfriend (Katherine Waterston) asks her now-billionaire ex for just enough money so she and their daughter (Jobs refuses to admit she’s his) can pay the bills and not live in squalor. (L–R) Chrisann Brennan (Katherine Waterston) with daughter Lisa Brennan (Makenzie Moss) in “Steve Jobs”, directed by Academy Award® winner Danny Boyle. (François Duhamel/Universal Studios) \nBackstage, Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen), Job’s co-founder of Apple Computer in ’76, just wants some respect and acknowledgment for the team who helped Jobs get where he got. He does this on every launch. It could almost be a running gag except it’s not funny. The funny running gag is the fact that Steve knows two guys named Andy and constantly has to ask, “Which Andy?” (L–R) Steve Jobs (Michael Fassbender) and Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen) in “Steve Jobs”, directed by Academy Award® winner Danny Boyle and written by Academy Award® winner Aaron Sorkin. Set backstage in the minutes before three iconic product launches spanning Jobs’ career—beginning with the Macintosh in 1984, and ending with the unveiling of the iMac in 1998—the film takes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution to paint an intimate portrait of the brilliant man at its epicenter. (François Duhamel/Universal Studios) \nWill Jobs make nice and acknowledge his buddies who helped him? No such luck. No way. Jobs is stone-cold. But he made such endlessly cool stuff, and so we must find out what made him tick. And I say to you, if you want to know the answer, re-watch “Men In Black,” where Will Smith discovers that mini-alien, squatting in the pineal-gland cockpit of that dead guy’s head, pulling levers and pressing buttons. Steve Jobs the Man \nOn the topic of what makes Jobs tick, Wozniak asks Jobs what he actually does, much like Ben Kingsley’s character in “Schindler’s List.” And like Schindler saying “Not the work… the presentation,” Jobs replies using a hijacked idea he got by asking Japanese conductor Seiji Ozawa the same thing: Ozawa said, while the players play their instruments—he himself played the orchestra. “It’s not binary. You can be decent and gifted at the same time.” — Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple computers \nJobs saw himself as the conductor of the whiz-bang inventors and cyber-technician team. Maybe it was also from the impression of Ozawa’s impetuous, flying wild-artist hair that Jobs learned to layer a bit of artist-presentation over his own cyber-wonkiness. Because without the presentation, he was just a salesman. \nAnd a colossal control freak (he devised tools exclusively geared to open up a Mac, so no one else could). But essentially, he knew cyber-tech pretty darn good. Why? Because he brought it with him from the planet Vulcan. Steve Jobs the Cast \nLisa Brennan, Jobs’s daughter, is played by three actresses who collectively function as the emotional heart of the movie. Steve Jobs (Michael Fassbender) with Lisa Brennan (Perla Haney-Jardine) in “Steve Jobs.” (François Duhamel/Universal Studios) \nKate Winslet plays Joanna Hoffman, Apple’s head of marketing, and the only employee who can stand up to Jobs. Winslet looks and sounds quite a lot like Meryl Streep except that, unlike Streep, her eastern-European accent has a mind of its own and tends to come and go when the mood strikes it. (L–R) Academy Award® winner Kate Winslet as Joanna Hoffman in “Steve Jobs.” (François Duhamel/Universal Studios) \nRogen as Steve Wozniak has a line, said to Jobs, that sums it up best, “It’s not binary. You can be decent and gifted at the same time.” \nNo he couldn’t, and see—that’s your logical proof right there. Just like in “Monty Python and the Holy Grail,” where Michael Palin’s lynch-mob character, when asked, “How do you know she is a witch?” bawls out, “Because she looks like one!!!” We know Steve Jobs was an alien because he acted like one. \nAll joking aside, the Mac is a fabulous creation. Use one myself. iPhone too. But sometimes (just to be safe) I like to wear this tin-foil hat I learned how to make on YouTube, while using these products. \n‘Steve Jobs’ Starring: Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, Jeff Daniels, Michael Stuhlbarg, Sarah Snook, John Ortiz Running time: 2 hours 2 minutes Release date: October 9 Rated R 3 stars out of 5", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T00:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:41:05.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
