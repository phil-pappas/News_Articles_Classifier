Fans of both California teams have invaded the Strip en masse today for the three-point sports action. \nKobe Bryant will be the main man to watch for the Lakers, while for Sacramento it will be DeMarcus Cousins tapped as the best center in the league today. \nEarly in this pre-season, DeMarcus, with Rudy Gay and Rajon Rondo, have won three of their first four exhibition games. (Incidentally, the trio partied at Marquee in the Cosmopolitan to the sounds of DJ Vice on Monday night.) \nSo far in their first three matchups, the Lakers have failed to win, so expect plenty of intense rivalry between the two California cities. \nThey shouldn’t go to the game on an empty stomach, so I suggest they eat first when MLB icon Pete Rose hosts the grand opening of his Pete Rose Bar & Grill tonight, a 9,000-square-foot restaurant on the Strip across from Aria and CityCenter. \nThe eatery will be open daily for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Developed by HIG Management corporate executive chef Brian Littlejohn, the menu features specials that are a love letter to the three cities where Pete played: Cincinnati chili on spaghetti for the Cincinnati Reds; a classic Philly cheese steak for the Philadelphia Phillies; and poutine for the Montreal Expos. \nPete, who now calls Las Vegas home, told me in advance of the opening in a Q+A posted Oct. 2, “I love sports, sports fans and great quality food, and this allows me to bring all three together in the perfect location.” Jennifer Romas in Sexxy \n200 SHOWS: Time flies when you’re dancing up a storm and stripping off your clothes! This weekend, producer and choreographer Jennifer Romas will celebrate the 200th show of “Sexxy” at Westgate Las Vegas. \nHer new YouTube video shot and edited by Scott Santos is a sizzler.

Additionally, she’ll pay $1,836 each month in HOA dues. \nSTORK ARRIVAL: Las Vegas supermodel Chrissy Teigen, who jets here to be with her family monthly, is expecting her first child with singer husband John Legend. Launch slideshow » \nThe 29-year-old Norwegian and Thai beauty sent out an Instagram photo of themselves this morning captioned: “John and I are so happy to announce that we are pregnant :).” Congratulations from all their friends here at Vegas DeLuxe. \nDEATH ESCAPE: Las Vegas escape artist and illusionist Spencer Horsman finally conquered the death-defying Houdini water torture cell escape to promote the return of Criss Angel ’s “The Supernaturalists” to Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut. Criss, who hosted the stunt Monday, was going to yank the dangerous act from his show if Spencer failed a third time. Launch slideshow » \nSpencer had to be rescued from a water-filled Plexiglas coffin twice before when he failed to unlocks chains and padlocks and was rushed to a hospital. Spencer was suspended 75 feet high by crane for the stunt, which took him four minutes to complete. Criss and his cast of magicians return to Foxwoods from Nov. 11-15 and Dec. 16-20. \nCHARITABLE CAUSE: Circus Couture ’s “Twelve,” a celebration of performance, art and fashion, raised a record amount of $192,000 in its sixth-anniversary performance at the Joint in the Hard Rock Hotel. Nearly 2,000 guests attended. \nThe money raised benefits Children’s Specialty Center of Nevada, the state’s only nonprofit, specialized outpatient clinic that treats children with cancer who have good insurance, bad insurance and no insurance. “It’s an amazing thing to know the families we support in the fight could feel the love and passion this colorful community has for their kids,” said co-founder Erica Linz.

TAG is a campaign to help prevent bullying and support the more than 13 million American students who are bullied each year. Carrot Top will help kick off the campaign by tagging his celebrity friends and posting videos on social media encouraging others to get involved and donate. \n“I have made a career out of being different, but it hasn’t always been easy. I have had to deal with bullying throughout my entire life,” said Carrot Top. “This is an incredibly personal cause and something that affects almost every one of us. I want to encourage everyone to get involved.” \nSTAR SURVEILLANCE \nActor Channing Tatum attended Mat Franco ’s magic show at the Linq Hotel on Monday night. \n“CNN Tonight” anchor Don Lemon and former Mayor Oscar Goodman cruised up Las Vegas Boulevard in a 1968 Mustang during a driving tour and interview Monday.
