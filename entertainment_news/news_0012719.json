As an actor, he has always maintained that he doesn't fit into the quintessential category of a hero but hence have taken character roles, that has impressed upon the Mollywood audience.\nEven as a writer, the actor knows exactly what he is capable of. \"See, I can't write a Bahubali ,\" he says. \"It's impossible for me to write a fantasy or something historical. I am more in to interpersonal relationships - about friendships and love.\"\nOn the recent surge of young scriptwriters, he says, \"I think Malayalam cinema now comes up with amazing writers who have groundbreaking themes. The sort of projects that Kunchacko Boban, Prithviraj, Fahadh and I hear now are so out-of-the-box from what we heard 4 years ago. For me the greatest challenge as a writer is to find something that surpasses and surprises theirs.\"\nAnoop Menon's next script is for M Padmakumar's upcoming film and he also has agreed to write for Lal Jose and Priyadarshan next year.
