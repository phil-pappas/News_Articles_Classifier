But while elsewhere there were revelations about her traumatic past, her quest to find herself and her regrets over her TV network, they weren't subjects that hadn't been waded through before.\nNo new revelations: Grimshaw and Winfrey. \nThere were big statements: she was a victim of sexual abuse at age 9, pregnant at 14 during which time she felt suicidal, only to lose the baby a few days after birth, and sexually harassed in her first television job in Baltimore in the 1970s. \n\"I was sexually harassed but I knew if I did anything about it or said anything about it that I would never work in television again,\" she told Grimshaw.\n\"Today, nobody could get away with it but I knew that if I'd have said anything about it I'd have been crushed. I just sensed that the moment is not right.\"\nThere are no details about how the harassment happened, but Winfrey quickly moves on to telling Grimshaw she had faith that this troubled period would not last. \nIt is classic Oprah territory – and everything that made her define a new path for daytime television in the mid-1980s and emerge as a media behemoth. She talks about sharing stories, reaching \"A-Ha moments\" of self-realisation and her continuing mantra, living your best life. \n\"There never was a strategy, there never was a vision,\" she says of the show's success. \"In today's market, in today's [world of] American Idol, Australian Idol ...   [where] everybody has to judge you for the way you look, I would not have been able to make it. It is literally I think, divine timing.\"\nShe says she left to begin her network OWN in 2011 as she feared becoming stagnant and becoming the \"punch-drunk talk-show host\". OWN faltered in its first year, however. \n\"I mistakenly thought that as I matured and become more interested in what are the big questions, because those are the shows that really excited me ... I thought I could create a network where you just have those conversations all the time. I was wrong. I have never been more wrong in my life.  \n\"It caused me a lot of temporary pain and suffering because I was embarrassed, I was thrown off-guard with all of the vitriol from the press. I thought that I had actually earned the right to be able to take a risk, and if you take a risk and it doesn't work out, you don't have to get slammed against the wall for it.\"\nHer upcoming stage show, An Evening With Oprah , tours Australian cities in December. She told Grimshaw about feeling comfortable with being a \"tall poppy\" and and figuring out your purpose in life. \n\"This tour really is about sharing my life story, what I've been through and how I've come to actualise being able to live the best life for myself, and hopefully help other people do it for themselves.\" \nFor information on An Evening With Oprah, see ticketek.com.au.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T12:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:44:24.792+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
