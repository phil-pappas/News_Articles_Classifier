It’s an amazing experience.” What do you think of this years X Factor? Share your thoughts. Log in and start commenting \n“Boot camp is hard but great fun. There’s lots of stuff going on and the place that we went to was really beautiful.” \nThe Walsall Studio School student was just 12-years-old when he first appeared on ITV’s Britain’s Got Talent with New Bounce. \nSince then two members of the original line-up have left while MJ and Mitchell met Gideon and Luciel to form Tribe. \nThe quartet, who started the band at a family barbecue, have been together for around a year and a half now and take influence from the likes of Michael Jackson, Chris Brown, Usher and JLS. \nMJ said: “We all met at a barbecue and then we just started jamming. So went in the studio tried this that and the other and it all just clicked. \n“I’ve been in Tribe for a year and a half now and we’ve been in the studio deciding what direction to go in and thought X Factor would be a good place to showcase our ideas.” \nBefore venturing into the world of television, MJ played Michael Jackson in Thriller Live on the West End. \nThe former Uplands Junior pupil from Finchfield was snapped up after initially being rejected for the plum role for being too young. \nBut aged 10, and still a year under the minimum age limit, the talented lad was just too good to turn away a second time. \nHe got the audition through Stagecoach, a theatre group he attended at Newhampton Arts Centre in Whitmore Reans. \nMJ, who also attended the performing arts school BOA (Birmingham Ormiston Academy), is now hoping to put the place he calls home on the map. \n“I’m proud to be from here – you’ve got to be,” he said. \n“Of course I’m proud of my roots it’s where you’ve been brought up and you’ve got to represent. \n“It was madness playing Michael Jackson – it was really good because I was so young as well. I was mainly on tour so I would go to Germany, France, Poland and places like that and then we’d swap with other people playing the same part and I’d go to West End. \n“It doesn’t matter where you go, everybody knows Michael Jackson so it was such an honour to get to play him. In the next five years I just hope we’re touring, recording, selling out massive arenas and just make an impact on the world with music.” \nHe sums up: “I’m just so excited for the future.” \nTo keep up-to-date with Tribe follow them on Twitter here or find them on Facebook here .
