If you like '90s nostalgia: Scream\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail Neve Campbell, Matthew Lillard, Rose McGowan: The movie screams 1996 as much as it screams ​Scream ​. Related: Pour one out for the late Wes Craven , who directed ​the movie and a *~terror-trove of other memorable horror titles, like Johnny Depp's debut, ​A Nightmare on Elm Street.\n2. If serial-killer villains are your thing: Maniac\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail More From Cosmopolitan Lord of the Rings ​ will never be the same once you see Elijah Wood play Frank Zito, a serial killer who targets women, scalps them, and attaches their hair to mannequins at his mannequin shop. Sounds like a vapid/sexist slasher movie, but it actually rises above the fray. As critic Megan Lehmann wrote for ​ The Hollywood Reporter ​ after screening the movie at Cannes in 2012 (a fancy opening for a horror movie): \"Wood's limpid saucer eyes are used here to telegraph unhinged blood-lust and insanity, even if only sporadically, as he plays a sicko with mommy issues who scalps his female victims. The twist, and what helps elevate the nasty, no-holds-barred Maniac from the grindhouse to an out-of-competition midnight-screening slot in Cannes, is that the entire movie is shot from the killer's POV — we only glimpse Wood in reflection and in photographs.\"\nTrivia: Elijah is actually a big horror fan IRL. He co-founded a film production company called SpectreVision (formerly known as The Woodshed) in 2010, which puts out mostly horror movies. ​\n3. If you value indie cred: Creep\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail What an odd and unsettling movie. The premise: A guy (indie stud Mark Duplass, who also co-wrote the movie) hires a videographer (Patrick Brice, who directed and co-wrote) off Craigslist to shoot a documentary-style video of him for a day, claiming he is dying and the footage is for his unborn child. Can't say much more without giving too much away, but know that the ending will not disappoint.\n4. If you're into the supernatural: The Pact\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail This is not a great movie, but it's an engaging one, and it'll scratch your itch for supernatural and real-life nightmares alike. The plot: two sisters go to their mom's now-empty — or so they think — home after their abusive mom dies. One disappears, the other tries to find her with help of a Ouija board and a psychic type, among other things. Only there's more at play than ghosts.\n5.
