September 18th 2015 19 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/Entertainment/ \nAnne Hathaway may be playing the quintessential tech-savvy millennial in upcoming movie, The Intern, but she admits she’d be lost in real life without her husband’s computer expertise. \n“I was a Luddite for many, many years. My husband is really good with technology and eventually I got really sick of asking him how to do everything,” she confesses. \n“So I started to pay attention and he explained to me how it works. Now I’m definitely more adept than I was.” Actor Anne Hathaway and husband Adam Shulman. Picture: Michael Loccisano/Getty Images. Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro in a scene from the film The Intern.

He is number one on my list of people I go to for advice. I’m so lucky. Considering he’s only a couple of years older than me, he’s very grounded and I am very comfortable to go to him for anything.” \nHathaway says she is also fortunate to have a large and diverse group of friends.
