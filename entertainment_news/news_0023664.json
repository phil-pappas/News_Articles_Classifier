It is Airport You, the kind who deems $27 hummus trays acceptable, and probably dresses like Tom Hanks in Big . You do not normally shell out for $33 Greek yogurts or $47 apples, but you’re trapped. You must resist this urge. You must, dear reader, become what most comedians would call “the worst person on the airplane.”\nBecoming the worst does not mean disrespecting others’ personal space, howling at Minions at a piercingly high volume, and fighting with security. Becoming the worst, in this case, is simply going against the grain. Think of it like you’re becoming an airplane outlier.\nStick with me and I’ll tell you how.\nPack a Lunch\nEvery time I board a plane, it’s like I’m heading on a school trip where the air is ripe with possibility and everyone’s making out to The Gin Blossoms. In the same spirit, I pack a lunch.\nThis is where you really stand up to aggro-airport consumerism. Visit a Whole Foods or similar grocery store that’s fancy enough to have a salad bar, grab a couple of extra salad containers and bingo-bongo, you’ve got something to hold your grub the next day. Buy something when visiting this store, because you’re not a monster and you want to come back eventually. Plus, just remind yourself that they’ve seen worse.\nAnd, on that note…\nPack Dry Foods, for the love of God\nThis is really for your own comfort level. Hummus doesn’t maintain it’s yummy component when stewing in your fanny pack for eight hours. Pack nuts, granola bars, anything that doesn’t fall in the TSA liquid prohibition.\nThen, after that…\nGo Buck Wild\nWanna pack a whole freezer bag filled with diced cucumbers? Well this is ‘Merica brother, and you pay your diced-cucumbers-in-a-freezer-bag taxes. Want to separate Pop Chips between old-timey hobo napkins? Sure! Wishing to assemble your own McMuffin out of a triscuit, a can of Cheez Whiz, and an expired coupon from Bed Bath & Beyond? Well, you can’t bring an aerosol cheese can through security. Were you even listening?\nGet a full Charge on Your Electronics Before Leaving Ground\nI can’t tell you how many times I’ve been crestfallen at a six-hour flight with no electrical outlets, no TV screens, and just my worthless imagination to occupy me. Even people in the 60s had a projector screen playing a Charles Bronson double-feature as they flew! Make sure you come prepared.\nDownload Two Episodes of a Gripping HBO Show, Seven Episodes of Something Stupid\nYou will have full intentions to get through The Wire on this flight, but, my dear reader, don’t fool yourself. Download that Bravo show you hate yourself for loving.\nI’m going to be honest with you guys: Being the worst means people will look at you weird. They will ask you questions about the meal expanding magically from your backpack. One such passenger on a flight from New York to Los Angeles will lean in too close and remark, “Oooh, what are we having tonight?!” “We” are not having anything, buddy. “We” are wishing you would stop leaning into my kale salad.\nJust remember that other people are going to be the worst, too.\nThe Remainder of My Travel Knowledge\nBring your own ear buds, because gross. Bring hand sanitizer from a dollar store, because you WILL get sick. Buy plane tickets 40 or so days in advance. Never pay for in-flight Wifi — it doesn’t work anyway. Buy plane tickets after 9 am on a Tuesday, and from the airlines themselves. No matter where you are in relation to your airport, depart an hour before you’re supposed to. Smile and ask the flight attendants how their day is going, because your mother raised you right.\nSee the full story at www.Savings.com </p", "external_links": ["http://www.savings.com/blog/post/become-the-worst-in-the-air.html"], "published": "2015-10-10T09:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:15:05.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
