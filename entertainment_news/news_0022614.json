Fox and Christopher Lloyd, who played the much-loved McFly and Dr Emmett \"Doc\" Brown, reunite on screen to discuss which predictions \"Back to the Future Part II\" got right.\nWhile the so-called hover boards have yet to make their commercial debut, other gadgets such as wearable eye glass screens and video calls have turned out closer to the mark.\n\"We've got 3D movies,\" Lloyd says as the two actors sit in a diner. \"We've got fingerprint technology,\" Fox answers.\nOther companies have also joined in.\nPepsi unveiled a limited run of \"Pepsi Perfect\", the soda McFly drinks in the film, while Nike, whose power-laced shoes the character wore, tweeted Fox on Tuesday saying \"See you tomorrow\", leaving fans speculating over the message.\nAn article in Britain's Guardian newspaper, meanwhile, suggested that fans might be seeing the forest for the trees.\n\"The world ... is full of millions of idiots complaining about the lack of hoverboards via hand-held devices that are connected to the sum total of the history of human knowledge,\" it said.\nFox and Lloyd are due to make an appearance at a special New York screening of the film and a 30th anniversary Blu-ray and DVD of the trilogy is being released to mark the occasion.\nSome fans had hoped for a revival of the franchise at a time when others movies are getting reboots. But earlier this week, one of the films' executive producers said a fourth installment was unlikely.\n(Reporting By Reuters Television Editing by Jeremy Gaunt.)\nActors Christopher Lloyd (l), Michael J Fox (c) and Lea Thompson (r) attend a media conference for the 30th anniversary of their film ''Back to the Future'' at the London Film and Comic-Con in London, Britain July 17, 2015.
