Authorities in Nevada say it's believed the ex-NBA star overdosed on cocaine before he ended up unconscious at a Nevada brothel last week. A sheriff's detective sought a search warrant on Oct. 13 -- not long after Odom was taken from the brothel. Court records obtained by The Associated Press reveal the warrant says that prostitutes who were hanging with Odom told police they believe he did cocaine in a bathroom while they were in the bedroom. Brothel officials told reporters that workers saw Odom drink alcohol and take \"herbal Viagra\" -- but none saw him take illegal drugs. Police have taken a blood sample from Odom. It has yet to be determined whether he, the brothel or any of its employees might be charged in the case. \nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- Lamar Odom continues on the road to recovery. His family says he has been undergoing \"aggressive\" therapy in Las Vegas and Los Angeles -- and as a result is \"beginning to gradually flourish\" mentally and physically. A statement from the family says Odom's speech is improving and that he is more \"cognitively responsive.\" RUSEELL SIMMONS - RUSHCARD PROBLEMS FIXED? \nNEW YORK (AP) -- It looks like the problems with the RushCard are starting to go away. Users of the pre-paid debit cards backed by Russell Simmons are starting to get access to their money -- more than a week after a computer problem cropped up. A technology upgrade caused thousands of RushCards to show a zero balance -- or unable to access the money remaining on the cards. The company says while the vast majority of problems were resolved, still a \"handful\" of customers are unable to get their money. DANIEL CRAIG - BOND \nLONDON (AP) -- Remember when Daniel Craig was popping off about not wanting to do any more James Bond films? Maybe it was just talk. Now he's saying he loves making Bond movies -- and asked if he planned to return to the spy series, Craig joked: \"Do I have a choice?\" The latest Bond film, \"Spectre,\" makes its world premiere in London on Monday. In a recent interview, Craig implied he'd rather slit his wrists than do another Bond movie -- and if he did, it would only be \"for the money.\" SIMON COWELL - \"AMERICA'S GOT TALENT\" \nNEW YORK (AP) -- Looks like American TV viewers will have Simon Cowell to kick around again. The former judge on \"American Idol\" is returning to the judge's chair -- but in another show that he created. He will be on the panel for \"America's Got Talent,\" replacing Howard Stern, who left after this past season. The NBC show returns this coming summer. It's unclear whether the other judges from last year -- Howie Mandel, Mel B and Heidi Klum -- will return. \n<<CUT ..006 (10/23/15)>> 00:18 \"finish, like yeah\" \n008-a-12-(Simon Cowell, during \"American Idol\" broadcast from March of 2010)-\"of all day\"-Simon Cowell doesn't hold back in criticism of one of the young contestants on \"American Idol.\" COURTESY: ((longer version of cut in wrap)) Fox ((mandatory on-air credit)) (23 Oct 2015) \n<<CUT ..008 (10/23/15)>> 00:12 \"of all day\" \n007-a-13-(Simon Cowell, during \"American Idol\" broadcast from March of 2010)-\"me a break\"-Simon Cowell shows no mercy to one of the \"American Idol\" hopefuls.
