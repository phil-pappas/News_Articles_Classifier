An elephant seal. The food donation Emiyah Twietmeyer and company just made to Together We Cope.\nEmiyah, a 13-year-old honor society student at Prairie View Middle School in Tinley Park, collected 10,424 pounds — more than 5 tons — of food to benefit the clients of the Tinley Park-based prevention agency that provides resources to families in temporary crisis.\n\"When I found out the poundage, I literally started crying,\" Emiyah said. \"I was so shocked.\"\nThis was Emiyah's sixth year organizing the food drive. Yep, she was 7 when she started.\nThanks to the generosity of Tinley Parkers and the muscle and time commitment of a legion of volunteers, the drive has grown annually, from 500 pounds in 2009 to this year's 20-fold jump, which is enough to feed some 500 families and put a dent in hunger across the Southland.\nPacking a punch (and pouches) in fight against hunger Ginger Brashinger Trinity Lutheran Church in Tinley Park is stepping up its role in a global war on hunger.\nThe church will host a Feed My Starving Children MobilePack event Oct. 16 and 17, fundraising team coordinator Renee Tabor said.\nTabor said Trinity Lutheran has had a long-standing relationship with Feed My...\nTrinity Lutheran Church in Tinley Park is stepping up its role in a global war on hunger.\nThe church will host a Feed My Starving Children MobilePack event Oct. 16 and 17, fundraising team coordinator Renee Tabor said.\nTabor said Trinity Lutheran has had a long-standing relationship with Feed My...\n(Ginger Brashinger) Emiyah is quick to share the credit, with shout-outs to her mom and dad, Kerri and Ben Twietmeyer; her brother Luke, 11; and her friends Mary Allen and Zoe Swick, as well as lots of helpers from Prairie View and Palos East schools, Parkview Christian Church, the Tinley Park Public Library and her neighborhood.\n\"I had so much help. Most of them were kids,\" she said. \"And when we were finished, they all wanted to do more.\"\nEmiyah's 50 volunteer hunger fighters, half of them under age 13, joined forces at the end of September to canvass homes across Tinley Park. Supervised by adults, the youngsters were organized in groups and dispatched door to door, stopping at 950 houses to explain the mission and leave a donation bag with instructions.\nA few days later, they returned to pick up the goods, carry the bags to vehicles driven by more volunteers and then drop everything at Emiyah's house, where it was sorted.\n\"This year we had so much food that it filled our living room, family room, dining room and part of the bathroom and hallway,\" Emiyah said. \"It was crazy.\"\nThe Tinley Park Public Library set up a donation box in which patrons could leave items. Teachers Megan Klozik, at Prairie View, and Jolene Laka and Tim Pritchard, at Palos East Elementary, also joined the effort. Prairie View students donated 507 pounds of food. Palos East's \"Soup\"erhero Food Drive brought in more than 6,000 items.\nTeen's charity event to fight hunger impresses Magic Johnson Patricia Trebe In just a few years, Destiny Watson went from a shy introvert to the organizer of 40 high school students who will transform into zombies and descend on Apollo Park in Homewood Saturday for the We Scare Hunger Trail charity event.\nWatson, 17, will be directing the students in a scare fest unlike...\nIn just a few years, Destiny Watson went from a shy introvert to the organizer of 40 high school students who will transform into zombies and descend on Apollo Park in Homewood Saturday for the We Scare Hunger Trail charity event.\nWatson, 17, will be directing the students in a scare fest unlike...\n(Patricia Trebe) In addition to the usual nonperishable food pantry items, such as cereal, canned fruit and pastas, the agency had requested personal care items, birthday bags and Thanksgiving dinner ingredients, including canned sweet potatoes, cranberries and stuffing supplies.\nOnce the items were sorted — cereals in one area, Hamburger Helper boxes in another, Thanksgiving stuff in yet another — they were loaded into volunteer vans and Together We Cope trucks and transported to headquarters in downtown Tinley Park.\nKathryn Straniero, executive director of the agency, said, \"Year after year, Emiyah and her family have worked very hard. We are so grateful that they are willing to do so much to support Together We Cope.\"\nKerri Twietmeyer said the success of the drive proves there are no age limits when it comes to helping your community.\n\"What I'm most moved by is that families and children are learning that it's fun to give and that it's not that hard,\" she said.\nKerri said the massive effort, which takes more than 100 hours start to finish, is an opportunity for people to come together and help each other. She said her family has been on the receiving end of family and community support, particularly when Emiyah was born with a heart defect and had to undergo surgery at 3 weeks of age.\nThough her daughter is fine now and active in band and swimming and with the Prairie View newspaper, Kerri said she is forever grateful for the support her family received during that crisis and during other tough times as well.\nYouths find charity begins close to home Linda Girardi Oswego youths aged 5 to 17 are learning what it means to serve their communities, a legacy their parents are grateful there's a way to cultivate.\nHappy Helpers -- established three months ago for youths to participate in charitable activities to benefit local causes -- hosted a donation drive Sunday...\nOswego youths aged 5 to 17 are learning what it means to serve their communities, a legacy their parents are grateful there's a way to cultivate.\nHappy Helpers -- established three months ago for youths to participate in charitable activities to benefit local causes -- hosted a donation drive Sunday...\n(Linda Girardi) \"It's important,\" she said, \"to share that feeling with others in need. It's also important for us to be an example to our kids when it comes to giving back, serving and expressing our faith.\n\"This is by far the most important thing I've done as a parent,\" Kerri said. \"That small thing has changed a lot for us as a family.\"\nKerri was so inspired by her daughter's altruism that she changed jobs, from construction work to taking a position at the Crisis Center for South Suburbia.\n\"I am absolutely proud of Emiyah,\" Kerri said. \"It's very humbling to see children accomplish something so amazing. This has ended up changing a lot of families.\"\nTogether We Cope's pantry feeds some 5,000 people each month. Recipients get about 19 pounds of food per person, an amount that should last them three to four days, spokeswoman Patty Houlihan said. So even with Emiyah's generous gift, which will feed about 540 people, more food still is needed.\nTo help or for more information, contact Together We Cope at 708-633-5040 or visit togetherwecope.com.\nZion-based Muslim youth group walks to fight hunger Yadira Sanchez Olson Braving chilling winds on Saturday, a group of people participated in a 5K walkathon event in Zion to help raise funds for charity.\nThe Walk for Humanity is an annual fundraiser hosted by the Zion-based Ahmadiyya Muslim Youth Association (AMYA).\nThe local chapter is comprised of Muslim American...\nBraving chilling winds on Saturday, a group of people participated in a 5K walkathon event in Zion to help raise funds for charity.\nThe Walk for Humanity is an annual fundraiser hosted by the Zion-based Ahmadiyya Muslim Youth Association (AMYA).\nThe local chapter is comprised of Muslim American...\n(Yadira Sanchez Olson) Women Who Care\nWhat's a powerful, yet efficient way for busy, caring, compassionate women to give back to their community? Join economic forces, set some structure to the giving process and turn the experience into a social outing.\nOrganizations such as the newly formed 100+ Women Who Care of Will County have been popping up across the country since 2006. They are separate entities but they follow the same model: Women who care about their community commit to donating $100 four times a year. If $100 is too steep, they form teams.\nQuarterly, the donors meet for one-hour meetings, usually at local restaurants, where they put the name of their favorite charity in a hat. Three names are chosen and the nominators of those nonprofits give a brief presentation. Then the entire body votes and the entire amount collected — ideally $100 from each of 100 women — is given to that charity.\nMaribeth Carlson, who lives in Homer Glen, is founder of 100+ Women Who Care of Will County. The group began in May with six members. It made a donation of $600 to Shady Oaks, a summer camp for people with disabilities. By September, the organization had grown to 16 members. Two weeks ago, it donated $1,600 to the Lincolnway Special Recreation Association.\n\"There is no fundraising, no door to door, no tons of hours,\" Carlson said. \"It's just simple.\"\nIn addition to being a streamlined way to give back to local organizations in need, 100+ Women is an opportunity to network, socialize and learn about volunteer opportunities, Carlson said.\nThe goal, of course, is to recruit 100 women so that the quarterly donation can be $10,000, an amount that she says can have a large impact.\n\"It can be the difference between having a program or not, or keeping the doors open,\" she said.\nFor example, the LWSRA plans to use the money it just received to fund a scholarship program that enables people low on resources to participate in some of its programs.\nThere are other groups that work off the same premise, such as Impact100 Chicago, which recently donated $100,000 to the Crisis Center for South Suburbia, and 100 Kids Who Care, which asks its young members to donate $10 four times a year.\n\"It's a giving circle,\" Carlson said. \"As an individual, it's difficult to make a large impact. We all have charities we are devoted to. As a group to be able to help a local nonprofit in our community is a way to give back and show appreciation for our own blessings.\"\nFor more information on 100+ Women Who Care of Will County, visit www.100wwc-will.org or email Carlson at Maribeth@100wwc-will.org .\nCups of kindness\nCarys Umeker is 7, the age of reason and the age of boundless compassion.\nTaking a cue from Emily's Entourage, a community group that wrapped its arms around Emily Beazley, of Chicago's Mount Greenwood community, during Emily's battle with cancer, Carys asked her mom, a teacher at Richards High School, if she could help others by selling lemonade.\nTogether with her friends, Carys set up a stand at a 5K charity run Sept. 27 at Richards to benefit the Pediatric Oncology Treasure Chest Foundation and at the Ridge Run on Oct. 17 to benefit the family of Eric Lorenz, a Chicago Ridge man who recently died of cancer.\nThe Oak Lawn youngster will have another stand Nov. 19 at the Community High School District 218 administration building to benefit a teacher whose mom died of scleroderma and yet another during the St. Linus Turkey Trot on Nov. 21.\nCora Umeker said children are often natural givers and it's important for parents to encourage and facilitate that quality.\n\"If we don't teach her about compassion,\" she said, \"who will?\"\ndvickroy@tribpub.com\n@dvickroy\nCopyright © 2015, Daily Southtown", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56200f78/turbine/ct-abn-happy-helpers-oswego-fundraiser-st-1015-20151014", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562d1822/turbine/ct-sta-vickroy-food-drive-tinley-st-1026-20151025", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56116e93/turbine/ct-lns-muslim-youth-walk-for-humanity-st-1005-20151004", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5600628d/turbine/ct-sta-trinity-lutheran-hunger-st-0922-20150921", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56201b69/turbine/ct-sta-homewood-zombie-trail-event-st-1016-20151015"], "published": "2015-10-25T19:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T23:14:27.275+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
