Max, her brother-in-law, had planned to give the infant up to a questionable agency for adoption. Six years later, with a new identity, Laura, now called Laura McKenzie, emerges from hiding and accepts a teaching position in a small community in southwest New Hampshire. She introduces the child to the world as her daughter, Benjii. Despite many adversities, Laura is able to keep her secret, and provide a happy home for her and Benjii until the unthinkable happens. Benjii is taken from school by a stranger. A description of the stranger leads Laura to believe that Benjii was taken by an associate of her biological father. Although there are two police departments searching for Benjii, Laura finds she must launch a search of her own. Will she ever find her child?\nReaders who wish to experience this telling work can purchase “Felony” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708.\nAbout Page Publishing\nPage Publishing is a traditional New York based full-service publishing house that handles all of the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
