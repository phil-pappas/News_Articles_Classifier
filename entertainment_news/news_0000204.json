Rough cut (no reporter narration) ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript \nPrince Harry told ITV News on Wednesday (September 30) that more needs to be done to support the mental health of wounded veterans. He was speaking as he joined injured ex-servicemen and women on a section of their Walk of Britain journey for the Walking with the Wounded charity. Harry joined them in Shropshire for a 17-mile section of their journey. The team of six ex-servicemen and women are walking 1,000 miles in a 72-day expedition throughout mainland UK. They have either lost limbs or had other traumatic injuries in the line of duty. \"If you can understand that you've got a problem straight away and someone can help you, then you are curable, you are fixable,\" said Harry. \"Mental health or any issues involving your brain, in my understanding is not permanent. You can get help. So we just need to be able to understand that and appreciate that these guys need a little bit of support, they don't want pity, just a little bit of support and then they can get their life back on track,\" he added. He also said more needed to be done to get rid of the stigma of talking about mental health problems. \"I can't put my finger on it, but yes of course we need to do more, not just with these guys but with everybody. Mental health is a sensitive subject amongst a lot of people, but it doesn't need to be. I think we need to talk about it more, get rid of the stigma and what better people to bring it to the forefront than these guys because they are mentally strong and they are willing to talk about it,\" he said. The Walk of Britain began in Scotland on August 22 and will finish on November 1 at Buckingham Palace. Prince Harry has supported the charity since it was formed, taking part in their trek to the North Pole in 2011 and South Pole in 2013. He was also patron of the their Everest expedition in 2012. WWTW offers assistance to veterans who have been physically, mentally or socially disadvantaged by their service and assists them in gaining independence through new long-term careers outside of the military.
