It's a really cool idea, because it's the origin story. It's gonna happen at the beginning of this. We're going to bounce back and forth.\" \nThe actor indicated he has yet to decide who could play a younger version of his character, saying, \"We'll see. I don't know, we're not there yet, but hopefully he's got a hard head.\" \nThe last \"Die Hard\" release, 2013's \"A Good Day to Die Hard,\" grossed $304.7 million (Â£190.4 million) at the global box office despite negative reviews.
