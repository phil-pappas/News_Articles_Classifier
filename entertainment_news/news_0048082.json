But that didn't keep away the fans, many who dressed as zombies, or \"walkers,\" as they're called on the series. \n\"The Walking Dead\" is about people trying to survive in a zombie apocalypse. \nIt premieres Sunday at 9 p.m. Eastern. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T06:24:07.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
