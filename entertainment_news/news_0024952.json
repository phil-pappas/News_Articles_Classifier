She was in Rochester for a School Administrators Association of New York State meeting, which pulled hundreds of school leaders from across the state. They asked pointed questions about the direction of standards and testing in their schools, but Elia said she has gotten accustomed to tough treatment in her short time in the top post.\nSpeaking at times over muttering from the audience, Elia said the state has heard parents' and teachers' concerns about the current state of affairs and is implementing changes system-wide.\nThose changes include reviewing the lower-grade curriculum to see if it is developmentally appropriate; replacing Pearson with another test development company and increasing teacher involvement in test development; shortening the tests and piloting a computer-based component; and reconsidering the tie between student testing and teacher evaluations, which has been criticized as faulty by teachers and statisticians.\nBoth the state education department and Gov. Andrew Cuomo have convened committees to review standards, testing and teacher evaluations. Cuomo has said he wants recommendations to consider while developing next year's budget.\n\"It's important for you to know we are looking at all parts of the teacher evaluation scores, as they relate to the assessments, as they relate to the standards,\" Elia said.\nSince taking the top state job earlier this year, Elia has attempted to balance between acknowledging widespread dissatisfaction with current education policy and defending the basic framework of higher standards and uniform student evaluation.\n\"Everyone used to talk, in every place that I've been, about how New York had these great Regents exams ... and if you have a Regents diploma, you know the standards you've hit,\" she said. \"We need to get back to involving our teachers in developing the items and having them be tested for validity and reliability and having those items be matched closely to the standards they're teaching to.\"\nElia took several questions from administrators in the audience, including many on testing and standards as well as one on the role of poverty. In response, the commissioner seemed to indicate the state is considering a change to the way the Big Five school districts, including Rochester, get their money.\nUnlike the vast majority of school districts, which raise their funding through property taxes, large urban districts are supported almost entirely with state funding. That in turn makes them more dependent on the vagaries of the Albany budget process.\n\"I am looking at the funding formulas for districts,\" she said. \"Some of the most challenged districts (in state receivership) are districts that are not funded in similar ways to other districts. ... Across this state and this country, there are just places where life is much harder. And therefore it's much harder for kids. And if we're not concerned about that, who will be?\"\nA state spokesman did not return a request for elaboration on that point.\nJMURPHY7@Gannett.com\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nCommon Core task force seeks to reduce tests", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ebbe0eb82de06f811919bbeeeba7d9f4bfcda19b/c=0-184-861-1045/local/-/media/2015/09/28/Rochester/B9319046594Z.1_20150928170335_000_G51C2TPU5.1-0.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T19:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:03:30.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
