Photograph by: Steve Ullathorne \nOct. 13 to 24 | York Theatre, 639 Commercial Drive \nTickets and info: from $20, thecultch.com \nWhen Australian ensemble Gravity & Other Myths takes to the stage of the York Theatre, it will not be the first time we have experienced new circus in Vancouver. \nOne of the hits of last year’s PuSh Festival was Sequence 8 from Montreal, a stripped down circus in a proscenium environment that combined acrobatic feats with the personal stories of each of the eight performers. It was both minimalist and confessional, and about as far from the esthetically driven spectacle of Cirque du Soleil as you can get. \nSo it is the continuing evolution of the circus arts, as well as a Down Under iteration of contemporary circus, that is on offer with A Simple Space. Formed in 2009, Gravity & Other Myths is comprised of seven acrobats, supported by a percussionist. \nFounder Triton Tunis-Mitchell is the company’s general manager. He has 10 years on the performers, who are all in their early 20s. \n“I taught these guys back in circus school,” he says, in a telephone interview from Adelaide. “I did circus up to the age of 20, and then left for a while to become a physiotherapist. I find that I understand other people’s bodies better when I’m in my own body. But for sure what I call my ‘physio brain’ helped me to train better and stay injury-free.” \nGravity & Other Myths tumbled onto the scene with Freefall in 2009, built on the company when the cast was between 16 and 18 years old. Tunis-Mitchell says that work was about “finding our identity through putting on a show, exploring who we were and putting that on stage. We’re too old for Freefall now. So our second show, A Simple Space, is really: ‘Here we are.’ It shows our friendships, our position and place in the world right now.” \nThat place includes a gruelling schedule of international touring: This year the company will be in Canada, all over the U.S., the U.K., Sweden, Argentina and New Zealand. \nThe circus is performed on circular stage, surrounded by the audience on three sides. This creates a proximity to the artists and allows for lots of light spill, meaning audience members can see other audience members much of the time, creating an environment in which, says Tunis-Mitchell, “you can watch the response of others, and respond off their response.” \nA Simple Space is all about the real and the actual, physical feats where effort is not masked, a focus on everyday props like skipping ropes and balls, and plenty of audience interaction. \n“There is no hiding behind grandeur,” says Tunis-Mitchell. “We are very much there in front of you. I sometimes say Gravity & Other Myths is Cirque du Soleil with a fistful of grit. We smile, we sweat, we grunt. We fall over.” \nLive percussive music by Elliot Zoerner is central to the show. The company’s soundtracks are constructed from the ground up in the studio, with the composer presenting a musical idea and the performers responding, and vice versa. There is also an improvisational aspect to the score, which means Zoerner can respond when things don’t go exactly as planned, or timing shifts. \nIs there a specifically Australian brand of new circus? \n“We’re unique in Australia,” says Tunis-Mitchell, “but Australia does have a style that’s recognizable. It comes out of a hunger, an isolation from most of the circus community. We can’t go pinnacle, in terms of gymnastic technique or technical training. Therefore we have to go broad. I’d say Australian circus is very much based on creative play. We also have a very well developed network of youth and community-based circus companies. It’s a very different spin from European circus.” \nTunis-Mitchell is listed as an understudy on this tour; his bio says that his best trick is being stood on. I wonder about the craft and physics of that. \n“From a physiotherapy perspective,” he reflects, “when you’ve got someone doing a one-hand handstand and they’re balancing on your head, it’s like doing research on your own body.” © Copyright (c) The Vancouver Sun", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:45:53.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
