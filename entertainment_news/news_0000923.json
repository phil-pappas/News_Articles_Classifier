When the DeLorean Motor Company debuted its namesake car in 1981, it was everything he wanted -- right down to the gull-wing doors and the stainless steel.\n\"It wasn't the movie that did it, it was just the car. I just loved the car,\" he said.\nNewman bought a DeLorean that needed a lot of work in 1996, but didn't find the time (if only he had a time machine!) to fix it up until three years ago. He and his friend Jack worked on the car while his daughter Ryann played music and talked his ear off, he recalls.\n» Which predictions did 'Back to the Future' get right about 2015?\n» Celebrate 'Back to the Future' Day in memes\nNow he takes his car -- complete with a \"D LOREAN\" license plate -- out around Syracuse whenever the weather's good enough. Ryann also asks him to use it to pick her up from high school when possible, though he's well aware most people are bigger fans of the \"BTTF\" film trilogy than the ride itself.\n\"I get a 'thumbs up' or 'flux capacitor' joke most days I drive it,\" he said. \"I had no idea how much fun I would have.\"\nNewman's wife Stacy doesn't love \"the tuna can\" as much as Ryann, 16, does. She recently got her learner's permit and hopes to drive it herself someday.\nFor now, Carl says, \"the passenger seat will do.\"\nAnother New Yorker, Sal Sportiello, has his own DeLorean in Staten Island. He bought the replica in 2006 and has spent much more work trying to \"trick\" it out to look like something would really happen if it travels at 88 miles per hour:\nBack to the Future: Staten Island resident recreates the DeLorean In 1989, Back to the Future II went into the future to October 21, 2015. That day is here and we decided to celebrate by finding a Back to the Future DeLorean replica in Staten Island, NY. Sal Sportiello bought the car in 2006 and has made it as true to the movie as possible by buying old airplane parts and making custom pieces to create the car. Since we had access, we had to recreate one of the most famous scenes from the first movie when Marty McFly sees Doctor Emmett Brown and the DeLorean for the first time.\nNewman, Sportiello and any other DeLorean owners can get free valet parking at Destiny USA today as the mall celebrates \"Back to the Future\" Day -- October 21, 2015, the date Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) travel to in \"Part II.\"", "external_links": ["http://videos.silive.com/staten-island-advance/2015/10/back_to_the_future_staten_isla.html"], "published": "2015-10-22T02:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:12:52.207+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
