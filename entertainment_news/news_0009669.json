(@pryorandy) October 17, 2015How freaking amazing was @Maisie_Williams in #DoctorWho!! Love her :) #TeamAshildr @bbcdoctorwho pic.twitter.com/4tfWLZGngz— Elementaread (@elementaread) October 17, 2015If @Maisie_Williams is now a permanent recurring character in #DoctorWho then I will be very very happy with Moffat.— Oliver Caveney (@ocaveney) October 17, 2015can maisie stay in doctor who forever— mia (@claracswin) October 17, 2015.@Maisie_Williams Brilliant in #DoctorWho this week! Can't wait for next week!— Mile High Who (@MileHighWho) October 17, 2015However, other fans were less enthusiastic:Maisie Williams died quicker than Game of Thrones #DoctorWho— Yordan. (@YordanDim) October 17, 2015Capaldi good, Clara actually doing things, and the face scene good. The Maisie Williams hype has still been completely unnecessary though.— James Mortimer (@clonecastor) October 17, 2015Maisie Williams' casting was definitely hyped up to hell though for no real reason other than her Arya Stark in Game of Thrones past work.— Jake George Potts (@ShakeyJake25) October 17, 2015What a bloody waste of Maisie Williams. How about you invent a NEW character for her, Moffat? Consistent disappointment at Doctor Who.
