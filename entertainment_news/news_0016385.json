An employee stuck under a bed. Someone else who broke an arm while reaching for a sandwich. The excuses for calling in sick to work are endless and often outrageous. After all, who pokes themselves in the eye while combing their hair?\nNearly 40 percent of employees called in sick when feeling well in the past year, up from 28 percent a year earlier, according to CareerBuilder's annual study on the most absurd excuses for calling in sick. CareerBuilder is a partner of the Democrat and Chronicle Media Group.\nAnd gee, some of excuses do sound silly.\nHow about needing time to go dumpster-diving for personal belongings thrown away after a spouse caught someone cheating, or helping to free a cat stuck inside the dashboard of a car?\nBoth appeared on the survey conducted by the Harris Poll earlier this year of more than 5,600 workers, hiring managers and human resource professionals.\nAnother lame excuse reported on the survey? Having to go to the beach for more vitamin D — doctor's orders.\n\"I don't know if I have ever heard anything that far-fetched, but I have heard a grandmother story before and, ironically, you learn later that their grandmother has already passed,\" said Kara Palumbo, director of HR services for ER Associates, a Penfield-based career and staffing placement service firm. \"Maybe somebody wakes up in the morning and they just don't really want to go to work. We have all had those days.\"\nSome workers calling in sick, of course, actually don't feel well (27 percent). But the same percentage of people said they didn't feel like going to work. Others said they needed time to relax, catch up on sleep or blamed bad weather for not making it to work.\nMelisa Beauchesne (Photo: Provided)\n\"I called in to let my boss know I would be late because I was going to the ER to see if I needed stitches from opening my car and hitting my head,\" said Melisa Beauchesne, a Rochester resident. \"I made it to work, but my boss didn't believe the reason why I was late. He asked if I needed to talk to our employee assistance program.\"\nMidnight Janitorial owner Angella Luyk has heard several different excuses over the years, including the time a worker called in sick after a fight with a boyfriend. There also was a call about a hamster that wouldn't eat.\n\"My all-time favorite was the one who most recently called in sick because he was out looking for a better job,\" she said. \"Funny one, in that he is now collecting unemployment.\"\nBuy Photo Angella Luyk (Photo: File photo)\nHowever, some workers feel they can't afford to take a sick day even when they are actually ill. More than half (54 percent) have gone into work because they felt the work wouldn't get done otherwise. Nearly half said they can't afford to miss a day of pay.\nUltimately, those who are faking might want to think again.\nRoughly 1 in 5 workers caught using a fake excuse is fired, and a third of employers check to see if a worker is telling the truth about taking time off, according to the survey. Many ask to see the doctor's note or follow up with a call to the employee. Roughly one-third check on an employee's social media posts.\nThe reasons may be getting more outrageous as more employers do away with sick, vacation and personal time in favor of a more generic paid time-off policy.\nIn the end, Palumbo said, it all comes down to trust, and those employers who develop policies with feedback from workers are often the ones that rarely have an issue when it comes to the excuses involved in paid time off.\n\"It's not great to get caught in a lie, so why not be forthcoming and have a honest discussion about it?\" she said.\nTCLAUSEN@Gannett.com\nMemorable excuses\nEmployee claimed his grandmother poisoned him with ham. Employee was stuck under the bed. Employee broke his arm reaching to grab a falling sandwich. Employee said the universe was telling him to take a day off. Employee's wife found out he was cheating. He had to spend the day retrieving his belongings from the dumpster. Employee poked herself in the eye while combing her hair. Employee said his wife put all his underwear in the washer. Employee said the meal he cooked for a department potluck didn't turn out well. Employee was going to the beach because the doctor said she needed more vitamin D. Employee said her cat was stuck inside the dashboard of her car. *Careerbuilder survey conducted by Harris Poll.\n@ToddJClausen ABSOLUTELY TRUE STORY: I once called in sick, collect, from a foreign country. Excuse: I was in a foreign country.\n— Brian Cummings (@B_inShortsville) October 12, 2015 @ToddJClausen I once announced I was coming down with \" Playoff Fever\" at 2 PM in '07 when the Phillies broke a 14-yr drought.
