In May she teamed up with the Blue Jeans Go Green initiative which turns denim into insulation for homes to help Habitat for Humanity rebuild homes in New Orleans in honor of the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina.\nCrow listed the environment as a topic she hopes to see embraced by the candidates.\n\"To me that's the mother topic,\" she said. \"All else fails if our planet isn't healthy.\"\nCrow also said she's hopping there will be a push among Democrats to help middle-class and poorer families by raising the minimum wage.\nDebates are vital, she said, to try and filter out the noise of the pundits.\n\"There are a lot of people who have no business being pundits and I think sometimes the American people get caught up in (which pundit) is saying what, when really it's probably best to listen to what the candidates have to say.\"\n\"Knowing the political system and how little gets done every year for so many years it's hard to know when a political candidate stands up for what he believes in,\" she said.\n\"It's hard to believe that it could actually, possibly get done. But, that being said, it's still important to be involved in the political system and to feel like your voice will be heard and the only way your voice will be heard is to go to the polls.\"\nAs for Crow, she said she's not yet decided who she will support and will pay close attention to the debate.\n\"I want to hear what everyone has to say and see where I fall.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.wwltv.com/story/news/local/orleans/2015/05/21/sheryl-crow-rebuilding/27738755/", "http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/fbeinecke/sheryl_crow_explains_why_she_b.html"], "published": "2015-10-08T22:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:26:04.862+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
