By Marc Weiszer KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — A Georgia football team staggered a week earlier was dealt another body blow on the first offensive play of the game Saturday against Tennessee when Nick Chubb went down on the Neyland Stadium turf with a gruesome injury to his left knee that left him screaming in pain.\nThe star running back’s extended absence would change the complexion of the season for the Bulldogs.\nIt already was altered after Georgia’s 38-31 loss to a reeling Volunteers team that left the No. 19 Bulldogs in chase mode again in the SEC East race and probably closes the book on any chance to reach the college football playoff.\nAfter the game, coach Mark Richt said of Chubb: “I’m optimistic that it won’t require surgery, but I can’t say 100 percent. I just don’t want to give too much information because I don’t know for sure. As of right now, we’re still pretty hopeful that it won’t require surgery, but we’re not 100 percent sure of that. We’ve got to get some confirmation (Sunday).”\nGeorgia (4-2, 2-2 SEC) couldn’t win without Chubb, but it went on a wild ride before having its five-game winning streak to Tennessee (3-3, 1-2) snapped. It was the second straight loss after a 28-point home loss to Alabama.\n“You have to be positive,” Richt said. “If everybody thinks the sky is falling, and everybody starts pointing fingers and everybody gets real negative, it’s hard to continue to finish the season and continue to strive for the goals that we have. … It’s hard to sleep on a night like tonight, and it’s going to be hard to wake up and know that it really happened.”\nWhat happened was Georgia opened a 24-3 lead and then gave up 28 unanswered points before Greyson Lambert hit Reggie Davis on a 48-yard touchdown pass on the first play of the fourth quarter to tie the game at 31.\n“I don’t think everybody just dropped their heads and said, ‘Oh, no the game’s over,’ by any stretch,” Richt said of how the team reacted to Chubb’s injury. “But everybody loves Nick Chubb. Everybody respects Nick Chubb. I’m sure the Bulldog Nation’s heart sank when you see a guy like that on the sideline like that.”\nThe Bulldogs defense couldn’t get stops. It surrendered 519 yards and was shredded by quarterback Josh Dobbs, who completed 25 of 42 passes for a career-high 312 yards with three touchdowns and an interception and rushed for 118 and two touchdowns on 18 carries.\n“We’ve got to finish, that’s the big thing,” defensive coordinator Jeremy Pruitt said. “You’re in position to make a tackle, you’ve got to finish the tackle. You’ve got to wrap up, bring your feet and we’ve got to gang tackle.”\nGeorgia still had a chance to tie the game but Davis dropped a sure touchdown at the Vols’ 5-yard after he beat defensive back Malik Foreman on the play with 3:52 to go on a third-and-9 from the Georgia 44.\nGeorgia later drove from its own 1 to the Tennessee 22 with 6 seconds to play before an illegal substitution penalty put it at the 27.\nLambert’s pass to the end zone intended for Malcolm Mitchell in the right corner was broken up by Brian Randolph as time expired.\n“There’s really no other option but to regroup and come back and come back fighting,” said Lambert, who was 15 of 32 for 279 yards and two touchdowns. “I feel like we’re a resilient team, and we’ll be able to come back and move forward from this.”\nChubb was lying on the trainer’s table in the third quarter wearing a sweat suit as the Volunteers went ahead 31-24 on a 2-yard touchdown pass from Dobbs to Alvin Kamara.\nGeorgia went three and out on its first three offensive possessions after losing Chubb with what was announced as a left knee injury.\nReplays of the injury made viewers cringe.\nChubb took a pitch and was knocked towards the ground by defensive back Emmanuel Mosely, but put a hand down to steady himself and spun around and was hit near the sideline by linebacker Jalen Reeves-Maybin.\nChubb had his left leg planted, and it gave out after the hit by Reeves-Maybin.\n“A lot of us prayed for him and saw how he was doing and went over there and tried to check up on him,” Lambert said.\nChubb was a Heisman Trophy contender who led all active NCAA players with a career rushing average of 127.3 yards per game.\n“He’s probably the least deserving person for something like that to happen to,” Lambert said. “It was tough, but we had what, 59 minutes and 30 seconds left in the ballgame. It’s an next-man-up mentality.\nChubb had tied Herschel Walker for a Georgia record last week with his 13th straight 100-yard rushing game.\n“Keep your head up @NickChubb21!!!,” Walker tweeted in the first half.\nSony Michel rushed for 145 yards on 22 carries with Chubb sidelined.\nGeorgia will look to avoid a three-game slide when it plays Missouri on Saturday night in Athens.\n“It’s a wild league,” Richt said of where Georgia goes from here. “A lot of teams are capable of beating each other. We’re definitely not losing hope by any means of our goal to get to Atlanta. Our big thing is to get better. Our big thing is to find a way to beat Missouri.”\nGeorgia 7 17 0 7—31\nTennessee 3 14 14 7—38\nFirst Quarter\nGeo—Floyd 96 fumble return (Morgan kick), 6:14.\nTenn—FG Medley 22, 1:39.\nSecond Quarter\nGeo—Mitchell 28 pass from Lambert (Morgan kick), 14:53.\nGeo—FG Morgan 37, 4:47.\nGeo—R.Davis 70 punt return (Morgan kick), 3:27.\nTenn—J.Smith 39 pass from Dobbs (Medley kick), 1:04.\nTenn—Kamara 2 pass from Dobbs (Medley kick), :27.\nThird Quarter\nTenn—Dobbs 1 run (Medley kick), 8:31.\nTenn—Kamara 2 pass from Dobbs (Medley kick), 1:26.\nFourth Quarter\nGeo—R.Davis 48 pass from Lambert (Morgan kick), 14:53.\nTennDobbs 5 run (Medley kick), 5:48.\nA—102,455.\nGeo Tenn\nFirst downs 15 26\nRushes-yards 29-165 48-207\nPassing 279 312\nComp-Att-Int 15-33-0 25-42-1\nReturn Yards 70 23\nPunts-Avg. 7-42.9 7-45.0\nFumbles-Lost 3-1 1-1\nPenalties-Yards 7-51 3-15\nTime of Possession 25:57 34:03\nINDIVIDUAL STATISTICS\nRUSHING—Georgia, Michel 22-145, Marshall 5-24, Chubb 1-2, Lambert 1-(minus 6).
