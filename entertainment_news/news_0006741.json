Cubs superfan Eddie Vedder was all over TV last night during the Cubs' 8-6 win over the Cardinals at Wrigley Field.\nThe Pearl Jam frontman told Fox Sports Midwest before Monday's game that this Cubs season has been a surprise and he likely won't be able to attend games in the coming weeks because the band is scheduled to play in South America in early November.\n\"All I'm saying is that the next few years we're not going to play in October, and this year I didn't think we had to worry about it,\" Vedder said. \"But I hope we go to the World Series and I hope I miss the games. It would be a good problem to have.\"\nThe Cubs face off against the Cardinals at Wrigley Field in the fourth game of the National League Division Series Tuesday at 3:37 p.m. Vedder is expected to attend, a Cubs spokesperson said.\nCopyright Â© 2015, Chicago Tribune Chicago Cubs St. Louis Cardinals Starlin Castro Addison Russell Wrigley Field National League", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgLdDUE3DQc", "http://pearljam.com/tour", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561d454d/turbine/ct-eddie-vedder-cubs-20151013"], "published": "2015-10-13T21:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:16:35.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
