New England remains undefeated after a big Sunday Night Football win over AFC rivals the Indianapolis Colts, while the 4-1 Jets are contending for a possible playoff spot later this season. Today’s game in Foxborough will be a measuring stick for the visitors as the 2015 NFL live streaming online and televised game will be available through CBS.\nThe ESPN.com website reported on Oct. 25 that first place in the AFC East is on the line in today’s game. New York has impressed early and is just one game behind New England right now for the division lead. This game would tie the two teams in terms of record but give the Jets the tie-breaking win over them. However, Tom Brady has been 21-7 in his career against New York, and seems on a mission this season after getting past the “Deflategate” scandal that rocked the NFL and the Patriots in the offseason.\nIn last Sunday night’s game, the 5-0 Patriots defeated Indianapolis 34-27. Brady threw for 312 yards and three touchdowns on 23-for-37 passing, with Danny Amendola catching seven for 105 yards. Legarrette Blount was also good on the ground with 16 carries, nearly 100 yards and a touchdown. For the Jets, their most recent game was a 34-20 win over Washington, yet they also beat the Colts in their second game, 20-7. The team currently ranks first in the NFL in rushing yards with 146 per game thanks to Chris Ivory’s 115 per game.\nThe odds for Sunday’s game have New England favored by 7-1/2 points on the spread or -335 on the moneyline. As underdogs, the Jets are +305 entering the game. For the over/under points total, bettors are looking at a number of 47-1/2 total points for this game. The Pats have been 3-1-1 ATS and 3-2 for the over while the Jets are 4-1 ATS and 2-3 in terms of hitting over the points total.\nSunday’s Jets vs. Patriots game has a scheduled start time of 1 p.m. Eastern Time.
