I didn't know if they were chasing a guy or what, and there was a bus on the side of the street that was about to pull off, and they were beating on the side of the bus. And I looked at the time and it was like, 1 a.m., so that might be the last bus of the night, and I was just like, really saddened. \n\"I was like, 'How can I make my son feel that?' Because once you've felt that, then none of these f**king questions matter. When you've missed that last bus before, when you have the opportunity to get on the bus? You don't give a f**k about any of this. And having to sleep downtown in a parking lot, it's almost like not feeling anything. It's almost like being numb because of what I went through.\" kanye west", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T05:19:08.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
