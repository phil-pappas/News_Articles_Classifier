Photo: AMC \nLast week's The Walking Dead recap If this week's episode had a theme song it would be Sisters Are Doing it For Themselves . And by doing it I mean everything: gardening, cooking, nursing, sticking scissors into the jugulars of invaders. Talk about tits on a bull: those men don't lift a finger around here.\nThe men are of course out executing a brilliantly thought-out plan to lead a squijillion zombies away from the quarry right past the front gate of Alexandria. What could go wrong? Well, we know what – that air horn that sounded at the end of last week's ep, and began drawing the zombies towards the town, that's what.\nJessie (Alexandra Breckenridge) fights off one of an invader. Photo: AMC \nThe source of all that racket? A man, tooting his own horn, natch. \nAdvertisement That marauding pack of savages who call themselves The Wolves have come to town, and one of them has used a semitrailer as a battering ram. Shot dead, he slumps over on the dashboard, landing on the horn until someone – Deanna's son Spencer (Austin Nichols), too scared to have joined the mission outside – can drag him off.\nBut the womenfolk aren't taking this invasion lying down. While some of them cower and Deanna (Tovah Feldshuh) makes the politician's feeble claim that she'd be of more use to her people hidden in a bunker until this shit-storm passes, it's Carol (Melissa McBride) who rises to the occasion. Of course.\nEnid (Katelyn Nacon) is almost indistinguishable from a walker after she devours a tortoise. Photo: AMC \nHow awesome is Carol? We first met her back in season one, a battered wife cowering before the brute presence of her abusive husband. She's grown ever more fearless, regularly dispatching the zomboid and soon-to-be zomboid alike with a deftly wielded knife to the brain. As she's offing an invading Wolf, Morgan says to her \"You don't like it\". I reckon he's right, but she doesn't exactly hate it any more either.\nCarol has been playing double agent since the group arrived at Alexandria, wearing her old meek-housewife identity like an invisibility cloak. Now, she dons another disguise, taking the black overcoat and long scarf of one of the Wolves she's killed, daubing a W on her forehead in blood and pretending to be one of them. She's a woman who runs with the Wolves, and she looks like Desmond from Assassin's Creed as she hacks her stealthy way through the pack, and in the final shot she looks like Clint Eastwood in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly , and in every scene she UTTERLY ROCKS.\nBut Carol doesn't have the show entirely to herself. Her sister in beaten-wifedom, Jessie (Alexandra Breckenridge), has her moment too.\nAn invader gets into her home, knocks the pistol she is holding out of her hand, and throws her against the wall. Jessie slumps to the floor, seemingly unconscious, while the Wolf goes for the gun. But Jessie is faking it. Years of being beaten around by her old man Pete (of late deceased) has taught her the value of staying down. But she's also learning the value of fighting back, and while the invader is reaching down for the pistol she grabs a pair of scissors from the island bench and jabs them into his neck. Again and again and again. It's like she's doing it to Pete, avenging all the years of violence and pain, and when it's over she sticks the invader in the brain because she knows what happens next.\nIt's adapt-or-die time in Alexandria, and Jessie is adapting, quickly.\nThis week's episode, by the way, is directed by Jennifer Lynch, daughter of David and a woman who made her big-screen bow with Boxing Helena , a film about a woman (Sherilyn Fenn, from Papa Lynch's Twin Peaks ) whose possessive lover (Julian Sands) cuts off her arms and legs and keeps her in a box to ensure she can't escape. I reckon we can call this episode Helena's Revenge , don't you?\nActually, it's titled JSS , and it takes us a while to work out why. It starts on a scene of a teenage girl in a broken-down car, her unseen parents trying to fix a fuse. Zombies close in, and the girl begins to panic; her parents are all \"it's OK sweetie\", and then there's a jump cut and her parents are lunch.\nWe don't see how she gets away, but we do see her cowering beneath a board with the words \"sweet corn\" painted on it (ironic, huh?), devouring a raw tortoise in the woods (looking for all the world like a walker devouring a human as she does so), and staggering up to the main gate of Alexandria (utterly dazed and covered in mud and blood). And three times, we see her write JSS – scratched in the dirt, spelt out with tortoise bones, scraped from the dried blood on her hand.\nWhat does it mean? Is it txt-speak for Jesus, and is that some spin on JC's words to Peter about thrice-denying him before cock crow? Is her name Jess, but she's dropped an E? (Maybe the whole show is a product of her wigged-out state; that could be good – at least tomorrow it will be over, apart from the come-down.) Is it \"just say something\", because so far she hasn't said a word since since seeing her folks become a packed lunch in the woods?\nThe answer is (d) none of the above. It turns out this is Enid (Katelyn Nacon), the girl Rick's son Carl (Chandler Riggs) and Jessie's son Ron (Austin Abrams) have been sort of passive-aggressively pursuing. And she's about to do a runner, heading into the woods beyond Alexandria.\nAs she leaves, she slips a note under Carl's door. On it are the words \"just somehow survive\". JSS.\nIt's the zombocalypse equivalent of E.M. Forster's famous \"to only connect\", and given the thousands of zombies on the other side of that fence, Enid is going to need all the JSS juice she can find.\nFollow Karl Quinn on Facebook: karl quinn writer \nOn twitter: @karlkwin", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:53:21.921+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
