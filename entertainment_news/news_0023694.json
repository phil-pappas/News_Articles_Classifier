He was 75.\nTiffanie Roppolo, the CFO of Prudhomme's businesses, told The Associated Press that he died early Thursday after a brief illness.\nPrudhomme became prominent in the early 1980s, soon after opening K-Paul's Louisiana Kitchen, a French Quarter diner that served the meals of his childhood.\nHe had no formal training, but sparked a nationwide interest in Cajun food by serving dishes -- gumbo, etouffee and jambalaya -- that were virtually unknown outside Louisiana.\nThe distinctly American chef became a sensation at a time when the country's top restaurants served virtually nothing but European food.\nPhotos Cookbooks by Chef Paul Prudhomme are displayed in a window at K-Paul's Louisiana Kitchen in the French Quarter of New Orleans, Thursday, Oct. 8, 2015.
