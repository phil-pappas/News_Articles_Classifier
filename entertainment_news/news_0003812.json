MARK RALSTON/AFP/Getty Images Travel Deals Maane Khatchatourian, Variety Media, LLC Posted: Thursday, October 15, 2015, 12:41 PM \nBy Maane Khatchatourian \nLOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - John Stamos has been charged with DUI stemming from a June arrest in Beverly Hills. \nIf convicted, he faces up to six months in jail for the misdemeanor count of driving under the influence of drugs, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office announced Thursday. The \"Full House\" alum will be arraigned on Friday. \nStamos was pulled over and arrested on June 12 \"after concerned citizens reported the defendant was allegedly behaving strangely and driving erratically,\" according to a press release from the D.A.'s office. \nHe was taken to a local hospital due to a possible medical condition after being cited for driving under the influence, and was released soon after. He checked himself into rehab for substance abuse in early July. \nStamos tweeted that he is healthy and \"feeling grateful for the love & support of family & friends\" after completing the 30-day treatment program. \nhttps://twitter.com/JohnStamos/status/624654960647495680/photo/1 \nHe told Details magazine last month that the arrest marked a \"turning point\" following his mother's death last September. \n\"You know, I've had a rough year with my mom dying, so it all came to a head, and it was a turning point,\" Stamos said. \"You either continue on that path -- and some of it's fun, but a lot of it's not -- or there's this other thing, this golden opportunity sitting there with all this work and all this goodwill that you have going for you. That's the key.\" \nStamos currently stars in Fox's new sitcom \"Grandfathered\" and is filming Netflix's \"Full House\" reboot, \"Fuller House,\" which he's also executive producing. \nFox declined to comment on how this would effect \"Grandfathered.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:19:20.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
