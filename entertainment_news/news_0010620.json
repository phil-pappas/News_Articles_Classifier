Parking and handicapped accessible entrance is at rear of the building. \nThis Halloween month, attendees should prepare to have see endoskeletons turned into shaking pools of radioactive waste, thanks to the 1954 horror classic “Them.” This film has everything — nuclear holocaust, giant man-eating ants, mile-deep catacombs and, if you watch carefully, a very early appearance by Leonard Nimoy. A film discussion will follow. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
