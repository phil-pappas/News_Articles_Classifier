The boyband has picked \"Perfect\" as the second single from their upcoming album \" Made in the A.M. \". \"Our next single is called 'Perfect',\" Harry Styles tweeted on Friday, October 9. \"Looking forward to you hearing it, hope that you like those apples.\" Apple Music actually shared the news earlier than Styles but quickly deleted the tweet. Liam Payne was later forced to confirm the single after fans went frenzy about it. There's no word yet on when the single will be released. There's five weeks left before the album hits the store, meaning the song could be dropped anytime soon. Meanwhile, another song that the band recently released titled \"Infinity\" is a not an official single but rather a reward track for those who pre-order \"Made in the A.M.\". The album would be the band's first sans Zayn Malik . Songwriter Julian Bunetta told EW the album was \"experimenting a little with different instrumentation.\" He added, \"We're stretching out outside of the perimeters of what a traditional pop boy band would do.\" It will go head to head with Justin Bieber 's \" Purpose \" album on November 13. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:08:58.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
