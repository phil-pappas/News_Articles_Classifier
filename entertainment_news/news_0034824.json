But the footage used was originally uploaded to YouTube in 2010 under the category of \"Gaming,\" and looks to be from a video game.\nMoussa, a well known, controversial talk show host, says while the video game footage airs, \"See what the Russians are doing to them! That precision! Look at that car! Wait for the missile to come down! No one gets away,\" according to the blog Egyptian Streets. In the footage, English, as opposed to Russian, is spoken.\nMoussa comments on his show that the United States has been playing with terrorists, while Russia does not joke around. And according to Egyptian Streets he also adds, \"These are ISIS fighters ... they're immediately wiped out ... no one gets away.\"\nMany took to Twitter to poke fun at the host.\nTonight Ahmed Moussa will air a report on Cairo traffic pic.twitter.com/D167csZ5i9\n— Basil El-Dabh الضبع (@basildabh) October 12, 2015\nTonight Ahmed Moussa shows proof of the existence of ghosts pic.twitter.com/ZKpmormkpR\n— Sima Diab (@SimaDiab) October 12, 2015 Two weeks ago, Russia carried out its first airstrikes on Syria. Tensions between the U.S. and Russia are escalating over Russian airstrikes that apparently are serving to strengthen Syrian President Bashar Assad by targeting rebels -- including some aligned with the U.S. -- rather than hitting solely ISIS fighters.\nOn Monday, Russian jets intensified their airstrikes in central Syria as government forces battled insurgents in a strategic area near a rebel-held province and a government stronghold.", "external_links": ["http://egyptianstreets.com/2015/10/12/egyptian-television-host-confuses-video-game-for-russian-airstrikes-in-syria/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aH-pd78_DTc", "https://twitter.com/SimaDiab/status/653622623843274753", "https://twitter.com/basildabh/status/653498951556050944", "http://t.co/D167csZ5i9", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/aH-pd78_DTc", "http://t.co/ZKpmormkpR"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:30:16.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
