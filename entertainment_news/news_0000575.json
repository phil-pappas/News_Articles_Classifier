Photo: Supplied \nDavid Sefton​ is determinedly going out with a bang as artistic director of the Adelaide Festival, with pyrotechnics bursting from the hallowed turf of the city of churches' revamped cricket oval no less. \nThe excitement in the Liverpudlian's voice is unmistakable as he outlines his final program for the 2016 event, his fourth as director after coming to South Australia from a decade-long stint at California's UCLA Live.\nThe fireworks come courtesy of Groupe F, the European company that most recently lit up the Eiffel Tower for Bastille Day, as well as the Palace of Versailles.\nThe National Theatre of Scotland's epic trilogy The James Plays is a highlight of the 2016 Adelaide Festival line-up. Photo: Manuel Harlan \nTickets for the performance, which with a crowd of 20,000 expected is by far the biggest staged by the festival, have also become the fastest selling in its 55-year history.\nAdvertisement In the first arts event at the revamped Adelaide Oval since it was christened by the Rolling Stones last October, Groupe F will open the festival with the exclusive show A Fleur de Peau , featuring pyrotechnics, large-scale video projections and illuminations at the stadium. \"It's such a massive show and it's the first time we've ever put a show of this scale,\" Sefton said on Thursday.\nAnother Australian exclusive is Rona Munro's epic 11-hour trilogy  The James Plays , a co-production of the National Theatre of Scotland and National Theatre of Great Britain, exploring the lives of Scotland's three 15th century Stewart kings, which was a centrepiece of Sir Jonathan Mills' final Edinburgh Festival in 2014. (The Australian performances, as well as the run on London's West End, will however be without Sofie Grabol​, star of Denmark's The Killing , who played Queen Margaret in Edinburgh).\nTanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch's Nelken, coming to the 2016 Adelaide Festival. Photo: Supplied \nOther highlights of Sefton's fourth and final festival include seminal dance company Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch​ with Nelken​ in the company's first Australian visit since Bausch's death in 2009, avant-garde Italian theatre director Romeo Castellucci​'s Go Down, Moses and monumental , from Canadian dance company The Holy Body Tattoo, featuring music from cult band Godspeed You! Black Emperor.\nSecuring each of those acts, who he has been trying to lure to Adelaide over the term of his post, to his final festival is particularly gratifying, he says.\n\"I'm really pleased, when you actually look at the shows, how many of the things are four-year conversations, from what we were having in 2012.\n\"It's great to land so many of these things for my last hurrah. It's personally very satisfying.\"\nWhat has yet to be resolved, and still clearly sticks in Sefton's craw, is the lack of venues for Adelaide-based companies (there are 10, including Australian Dance Theatre and the State Theatre Company of South Australia in the 2016 program) and the state of the Adelaide Festival Centre (which is undergoing repairs, thanks to the State Government, but the works will not result in an increase in capacity). \n\"There's no question that it's bonkers there's no concert hall, that [ours is] the only state theatre company without its own home. It's systematic problem over many decades.\" \nThe 2016 Adelaide Festival runs from February 26 to March 14. \nadelaidefestival.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:48:33.327+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
