MARINA CHAVEZ , COURTESY PHOTO Related article » If you go When: 6:30 p.m. Friday, Oct. 23\nWhere: Riverside Municipal Auditorium, 3485 Mission Inn Ave., Riverside\nAdmission: $30, plus fees.\nInformation: 951-779-9800, riversidelive.com\nDespite continued success in the form four straight albums that have sold well into six figures and produced a string of rock radio hits, Seether bassist Dale Stewart said the group felt as much urgency as ever to make an album that stood up to the band’s past work when it went to work on its current album, “Isolate and Medicate.”\n“I think every album you kind of have something to prove,” Stewart said in a recent phone interview. “And I think it’s good to put yourself under a little bit of pressure, you know, not so much so that where you start maybe pandering or write in a certain (calculated) way, I think. You have to find that balance to where you’re writing for the love of music and writing songs that you’d want to listen to as a music fan, I guess, writing with your heart instead of your brain. So yeah, I think we had something to prove. In this day and age, we’re in a fortunate position to be in a rock band that’s successful. But we also appreciate that that can go away. So you have to push yourself and try hard and grow and evolve.”\nFor Seether, which stops by the Riverside Municipal Auditorium on Friday, Oct. 23, pushing itself creatively didn’t mean reinventing its sound on “Isolate and Medicate.” But the band’s music is a bit more melodic, while very much retaining the heavy edge fans have come to expect.\n“I think each album we do, we approach it sort of as its own thing,” Stewart said. “I think at the moment melody is very prominent, but at the same time there has been a lot of really heavy riff stuff and heavy riff work. I think that was kind of our intention.”\nThe mix of melody and heavy riffage has been a winning formula for Seether since the original lineup formed in South Africa in 1999. Seether made a quick impact on the worldwide scene with its 2002 debut CD, “Disclaimer.”\nThe debut spawned a rock radio hit in “Fine Again,” and then took off after the band re-recorded a version of its ballad from “Disclaimer,” “Broken,” with Evanescence singer Amy Lee (who at the time was vocalist Shaun Morgan’s girlfriend) for the soundtrack to the movie “The Punisher.”\n“Broken” became a hit single and prompted the release of a revamped version of the first CD, called “Disclaimer II.”\nThe band has been on a roll since, with the follow-up albums “Karma and Effect” (2005), “Finding Beauty In Negative Spaces” (2007) and “Holding Onto Strings Better Left to Fray” each delivering multiple hit singles.\nFor “Isolate and Medicate,” Seether finished the entire album in 16 days, which was just fine with Stewart.\n“It’s kind of a musical snapshot, if you will,” Stewart said. “We went in and we were in the zone and fired up and all excited about the songs. We went in and we just knocked them out. It’s the quickest we’ve ever made an album. I guess it shows that you don’t have to sit in there for three months and kind of over-think everything.”\nSeether has been on tour since last summer and Stewart said that while his band’s success has been great, it does pose issues when it comes to deciding what songs to play.\n“It becomes challenging to do set lists after awhile because there are a lot of songs you feel like you have to play because those are the ones people know from the radio and they’re expecting to hear them,” he said. “And that’s what they’re paying the money for.\n“So it (the set) will be a bit of a mix, some of the old stuff that people are expecting and then we’ll try and put in some new stuff,” Stewart said.\nContact the writer: features@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwlhv6-b88543992z.120151021170921000gibcn1np.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwlhv6-b88543992z.120151021170921000gibcn1np.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:32:15.930+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
