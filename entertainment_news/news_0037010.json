Delhi is the hub of art and culture and it was really exciting to perform before Delhiites,\" she says. Like most celebs, Sonali too loves the Delhi winter, but there's something that she admires more about the city - the shopping scene. \"My friends usually take me to places like Janpath and Chandni Chowk for shopping. It's amazing how one can get amazing stuff for less than Rs 1000. What I really like about the Delhi people is their dressing sense. It seems like no one here takes their outfits casually. Here, people have an extravagant and sophisticated way of dressing up,\" she says.\nFor latest Theatre updates follow us on Twitter >>> @TOIEntertain\nFor the latest in Theatre news, like us on Facebook >>> TOIEntertain\nFor more interesting Theatre news and pictures follow us on Pinterest>>> timesofindia\nFor latest Theatre updates follow us on G+ >>> The Times of India Entertainment\nWATCH: Sonali Kulkarni returns to theatre - TOI", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TOIEntertain", "https://www.pinterest.com/timesofindia/", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107628521107103264647/+TOIEntertainment/posts", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/orjWQ6klkFQ", "https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T19:31:18.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
