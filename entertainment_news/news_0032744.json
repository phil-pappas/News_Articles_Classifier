FOOL FOR LOVE\nBroadway play revival, presented by the Manhattan Theatre Club at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre, 261 W. 47th St.\nWritten by Sam Shepard. Directed by Daniel Aukin.\nWith Nina Arianda and Sam Rockwell.\nSchedule: Varies.\nTickets: $70 to $150. 212-239-6200 or telecharge.com.\nIn the theater, sometimes it’s the storytelling rather than the story that matters most.\nThat’s the case with Sam Shepard’s slender drama \"Fool for Love,\" which opened in a revival Thursday night at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre.\nAnyone who saw Ed Harris and Kathy Baker in the play’s startling original production in 1983 in a little off-Broadway theater is unlikely to have forgotten it.\nThe actors, directed by Shepard, made the tale of Eddie and May, two people emotionally doomed by their misery at being apart and agony when together, into a desperate dance of passion, anger and hopelessness. As they bounced off the walls of a shabby motel room, the theater seemed to shake with their torment.\nIn the revival, in a much larger theater that perhaps diminishes the flow of the characters’ feelings, the visceral energy – and sexual tension — is much lower, allowing us to notice how modest the play really is.\nThe setting, on the edge of the Mojave Desert, suggests it’s Shepard’s vision of the New West, where, despite the wide open spaces, freedom for men – and women – has been curtailed by modern life.\nBut metaphor takes a back seat to the showdown between May and Eddie, who’s returned, again, to try to re-stir their tumultuous 15-year relationship despite May’s protestations that she’s had enough.\nMay is portrayed by Nina Arianda, who became a star with bravura Broadway performances in \"Born Yesterday\" and \"Venus in Fur,\" portraying, with great comic flair, two very distinctive women. The actress, who grew up in Clifton, gives a committed, thoughtful effort as the beaten-down May, but the character’s pain isn’t quite as jolting as it could be.\nEddie is played by Sam Rockwell in a somewhat muted style, striking cowboy poses or distractedly lassoing the furniture as he tries to woo May back.\nOne of the play’s two other characters is an unnamed Old Man (Gordon Joseph Weiss) who observes and sometimes comments on the action from a chair at the edge of the set. He is, probably, the link between May and Eddie, and the seed cause of their problems. (The back story of their relationship has an intentional murkiness that seems intended to link it with classic myth or tragedy.)\nThe fourth character, Martin (Tom Pelphrey), is a nice, simple guy who shows up for a date with May. He seems to be in the play as a change of pace and, more crucially, to listen as Eddie reveals to him – and us — his tale of how he and May came to be together.\nWith a running time of just 75 minutes, \"Fool for Love\" is a play you anticipate will proceed in a head-long rush. The revival, under the direction of Daniel Aukin, moves at a more measured pace, which is not to the work’s advantage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:22:12.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
