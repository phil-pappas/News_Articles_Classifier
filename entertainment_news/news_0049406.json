Only one team in the NEC got out of early non-conference play with a winning record (Bryant), which means the conference may be up for grabs. The young Colonials are still a long shot, but a win Saturday gives them some hope to reach that goal. \nInside the playbook: Luke Brumbaugh returns behind center for the Colonials thanks to the injury to Mathew Barr in last week's loss at No. 6 South Dakota State. But how long will he stay there? RMU used four quarterbacks last week, meaning Brumbaugh's lease appears to be short. \nKey player: Ramses Owens again is listed as the starter at running back, but he was last week and did not play against South Dakota State. In his place, Dante Satcher ran for 85 yards on just six carries, and Cole Blake (Moon) added 49 yards a week after rushing for 136. The Colonials outgained South Dakota State on the ground 228-125 and averaged 6.0 yards per carry. Whether it's Owens, Blake or Satcher, the tailback will need a big day for RMU. \nKey stat: It's a small number, but it's a big stat. The Colonials' offensive line allowed zero sacks last week, the first time in nearly a decade an RMU quarterback left a game with hitting the turf.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:30:45.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
