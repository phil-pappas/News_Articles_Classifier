Pastor Thomas A. Harris III says he was surprised to learn he could face an initial fine of $3,529, followed by $500-per-day penalties, for the \"joyful noise\" of choir practice.\nHarris says rehearsal ends at 9 p.m., but the complaint sent to the city says the loud music sometimes lasts until 2 a.m.\nCity spokeswoman Karen Boyd says the letter was a courtesy notice and that she hasn't received any more complaints. She says she doesn't intend to fine the church.\n___\nInformation from: San Francisco Chronicle, http://www.sfgate.com\n News Nation/World Religion Associated Press", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share", "http://bit.ly/1G9tDr2"], "published": "2015-10-16T20:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:04:15.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
