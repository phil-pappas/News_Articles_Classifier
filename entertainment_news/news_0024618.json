It tells the story of life in a New England town over the course of 25 years through the eyes of Maths teacher Olive Kitteridge (Frances McDormand). In the first of two parts, Olive is less than overjoyed at her husband Henry's new choice of assistant in his pharmacy, while her son Christopher grows uncomfortable with his mother's attraction to fellow teacher Jim O'Casey. Look out for Bill Murray too who also won an Emmy for his appearance in the series.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:43:29.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
