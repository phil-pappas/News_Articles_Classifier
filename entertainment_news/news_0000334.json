Bush's military service. \nAmerican director Robert Eggers' Pilgrim horror film \"The Witch\" won the festival's first-feature prize. Jennifer Peedom's Himalayan study \"Sherpa\" was named best documentary and \"An Old Dog's Diary\" by Shai Heredia and Shumona Goel took the short-film trophy. \nThe 59th annual London festival aimed to put strong women center stage, opening with Sarah Gavron's political drama \"Suffragette\" and featuring 46 female-directed films among its 240 features. \nThe 12-day event brought a slew of awards-worthy female performances, including Blanchett and Rooney Mara as clandestine lovers in \"Carol,\" Brie Larson as a mother in an extreme situation in \"Room\" and Maggie Smith as a redoubtable eccentric in \"The Lady in the Van.\" \nFounded in 1957 to show the best of the year's world cinema to a British audience, the London Film Festival has boosted its profile in recent years with bigger movies, more glittering stars and prizes to boost emerging awards-season contenders. \nIts prize-winners have a strong track record at the Oscars. The last two London winners, Andrey Zvyagintsev's \"Leviathan\" and Pawlikowski's \"Ida,\" faced off in this year's foreign-language Academy Award race. \"Ida\" won. \nThe festival wraps up Sunday with Danny Boyle's \"Steve Jobs,\" starring Michael Fassbender as the Apple founder. \n___ \nFollow Jill Lawless on Twitter at http://Twitter.com/JillLawless", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T00:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T01:25:15.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
