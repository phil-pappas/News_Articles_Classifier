The same, added Isaacson, could be said about how Bell Labs developed the transistor — drawing from researchers with different expertise.\nIsaacson previously served as a political correspondent and later editor of Time magazine. He then became chairman and CEO of CNN before moving on to the Aspen Institute in 2003.\nHis other books include biographies of Benjamin Franklin and Albert Einstein. He is now working on a biography of Leonardo da Vinci.\nFranklin, said Isaacson, recognized the importance of hearing diverse voices, which prompted him to form a club of shopkeepers in Philadelphia.\nEinstein was unusual in that he made his discoveries all by himself.\nIn speaking about the importance of humility, Isaacson said what a person contributes is much more important than trying to get credit for joint efforts. \"It is not what you take from the river, it's what you put in,\" said Isaacson.\nAfter his address, Isaacson answered questions posed by UR President Joel Seligman, who asked about the importance of individual genius.\nIsaacson responded that while genius is important, the development and implementation of ideas is needed as well.\n\"You obviously need both,\" said Isaacson. \"Vision without execution is just hallucination.\"\nIsaacson also said that the high-tech nature of research today, such as in biotechnology, necessitates collaboration in a controlled environment.\n\"You don't want to try this in your dorm room,\" he noted.\nWhen Seligman asked whether technology might stand in the way of human interactions, Isaacson told of the limitations of a computer and reminded Seligman that when they were growing up, households were glued to the TV.\n\"Interactive technology is so much better than the passive consumption that happened in the television age,\" he said.\nThe event ended with Isaacson telling of the importance of federal funding for research at universities, which are fertile grounds for innovation.\n\"We shouldn't deny our seed corn,\" said Isaacson.\nJGOODMAN@Gannett.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T06:31:24.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
