PICTURE: SUPPLIED Source: Supplied \nBUNGY jumping was something Aussie musician Ash Grunwald said he would never do. \nBut he reveals to The Cairns Pos t that before his last gig at Cairns’ own adventure capital AJ Hackett, he took the plunge. Literally. \n“The first time we played AJ Hackett, it was funny because I had a four-piece band at the time and the two little guys jumped,” Grunwald says. \nHe says he was too scared to follow suit on that occasion but, when another gig was booked at the same venue, he knew he couldn’t escape. \n“I was like, ‘oh well, dammit, I definitely have to go bungy jumping this time’,” he says. \nThe Breakout singer believes he could do it again, but admits it was still terrifying. \nGrunwald is taking over The Jack this time around for a solo gig on October 25. \nIt’ll mark one month since the release of his latest album Now , which at one point was sitting pretty in the No.2 position on the Australian Independent Music Charts. \nGrunwald recorded the album at Byron Bay’s famous (and now closed) Studio 301. \nThe result is an album Grunwald reckons is his best. \n“I’m very happy with it,” he says of the release. \n“This is a … little more of a psychedelic rock kind of album.” \nJoining in the fun was Wolfmother’s Ian Peres who provided keys and synth bass on the album. Its produced by Nick Didia, whose credits also include work for Pearl Jam and Rage Against the Machine. \nTo help see it realised, Grunwald turned to the crowd-funding website Pledge Music. He was able to exceed his goal by 25 per cent. The campaign saw rewards offered including a song dedication during one of his concerts and even a personal guitar or vocal lesson. \nWas there any hesitation in giving fans intimate access to himself? \n“I regard myself as a pretty down to earth person and don’t think I'm anything special, anyone special to hang out with,” he says. \n“The uncomfortable thing is when you put something down and it’s like $300 or something for a certain hangout kind of experience and you think, ‘oh well, who’s going to pay for that?’ But people do.” \nHe recalls one experience with a “pledger” in Western Australia who attended soundcheck, joined Grunwald for a radio interview and even met members of his family. \n“We basically hung out in that period that you have in your day when you’re a musician and she was just sort of a fly on the wall and we just hung out and chatted most of the time and it was epic.” \nGrunwald admits he did wonder how it would work out. \n“But it was just great. So I guess if the person was an absolute loony, it could be a little weird, but half of the music industry are loonies anyway.” \nCHECK Ash Grunwald is at The Jack on October 25.
