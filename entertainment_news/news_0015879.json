Tunisia is the only country in the region to painstakingly build a democracy, involving a range of political and social forces in dialogue to create a constitution, legislature and democratic institutions. \n--- \nThe Latest: Tunisian union leader 'overwhelmed' by Nobel Peace Prize. \nOSLO, Norway (AP) — The latest developments in the awarding of the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize. All times local. \n--- \n11:30 a.m. \nA Tunisian union leader who played a key role in democracy-building that won the Nobel Peace Prize says he's \"overwhelmed\" by the gesture. \nHoucine Abassi, secretary general of the UGTT union, told The Associated Press on Friday, \"It's a prize that crowns more than two years of efforts deployed by the quartet when the country was in danger on all fronts.\" \n--- \nIslamic State group seizes string of villages north of Aleppo city in surprise attack \nBEIRUT (AP) — Islamic State militants seized several villages from rival insurgents north of Aleppo city Friday, in a surprise attack that came despite intensive Russian airstrikes that Moscow insists are targeting the extremist group, activists said. \nIranian state media reported that a senior commander in Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard was killed by the Islamic State group on the outskirts of Aleppo city, but it was not immediately clear whether Gen. Hossein Hamedani's death was related to the new IS offensive. \nAn Iranian state television report said he was killed while \"carrying out an advisory mission.\" It didn't provide any further details. The official IRNA news agency read a statement by the Guard in which it blamed IS for his death. \nThe new developments come amid a wave of Russian airstrikes that have targeted insurgents fighting to topple President Bashar Assad, and a ground offensive by the Syrian army in the country's central region. \nMoscow says it is targeting mainly Islamic State militants, but U.S. officials and Syrian rebels have said the strikes have hit mainstream rebels for the most part and are designed to shore up Assad's embattled government and troops. \n--- \nThe Latest: Prime Minister condemns Israeli stabber who injured 4 Arabs in revenge attack \nJERUSALEM (AP) — The latest developments in ongoing tensions between Palestinians and Israelis following days of violence. (all times local) \n12.05 \nIsrael's Prime Minister has condemned an Israeli stabbing attack that injured 4 Arabs. \n--- \nAP Interview: Jerusalem mayor defends display of gun, saying he's keeping city safe \nJERUSALEM (AP) — Jerusalem's mayor, caught on video this week with a gun slung over his shoulder while visiting a Palestinian neighborhood, is making no apologies for the display of force. He says he's helping keep his city safe. \nIn an interview with The Associated Press, Nir Barkat urged other licensed gun owners to follow his lead, saying that Israel's plethora of well-trained army veterans gives the country an added edge as it confronts a wave of attacks carried out by lone Palestinians. \n\"In Israel we're fortunate to have many ex-military and current military reservists that are professionals, well trained, they know how to fight. They know how to use weapons,\" said Barkat, himself a former Israeli paratrooper commander. \"For us, it's an extra security measure that's not happening in the rest of the world.\" \nBarkat described Israel as caught in the midst of an unprecedented battle, with his city at the heart of the unrest. \nThe violence erupted last month during the Jewish new year with clashes at Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site, a hilltop compound revered by Muslim and Jews. \n--- \nIn tumult, House GOP seeks a leader after McCarthy's abrupt withdrawal from speaker race \nWASHINGTON (AP) — Jolted by political lighting for the second time in two weeks, House Republicans are staring at turmoil and uncertainty after Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy's astonishing decision to abandon his campaign to become the chamber's next speaker. \nGOP lawmakers, who lately have acted more like feuding relatives than a unified party, were meeting Friday to discuss their next move. On Thursday, Republicans munching barbecue at a closed-door meeting where they seemed ready to coronate McCarthy as their candidate for speaker were aghast when the Californian rose and told them he wouldn't seek the job. \nFacing opposition from a band of hard-right conservatives, some McCarthy supporters said he concluded he would have fallen short of the 218 votes needed when the full House formally elects the speaker. Others said he could have won but GOP lawmakers backing him would have infuriated conservative constituents back home, jeopardizing their own careers. \n\"It was only going to get worse,\" McCarthy said in an interview published Thursday night by The Wall Street Journal. He added, \"This was for the good of the team.\" \nMcCarthy's announcement leaves the race to succeed the departing Speaker John Boehner wide open. The Ohio Republican delivered his own shocker on Sept. 25 when he said he would retire from Congress Oct. 30. \n--- \nObama focusing on condolences, not gun laws, in visiting families of shooting victims \nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama is bringing words of comfort and sympathy to grieving families of victims of the shooting rampage in Roseburg, Oregon, muting his message about the need for new laws to stem gun violence as he visits an area where firearms are popular. \nObama will talk with family members Friday at the start of a four-day West Coast trip. Eight community college students and a teacher were killed before the gunman fatally shot himself in front of his victims after he was wounded by police. \nStaunchly conservative Douglas County is bristling with gun owners who use their firearms for hunting, target shooting and self-protection. A commonly held opinion in the area is that the solution to mass killings is more people carrying guns, not fewer. \n\"The fact that the college didn't permit guards to carry guns, there was no one there to stop this man,\" said Craig Schlesinger, pastor at the Garden Valley Church. \nReferring to potential protesters, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said: \"Those individuals have nothing to fear. The fact is the president has made clear that the goal of his visit is to spend time with the families of those who are so deeply affected by this terrible tragedy.\" \n--- \nUS airman stabbed outside California hometown bar months after thwarting French train attack \nSACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Airman 1st Class Spencer Stone, hailed as a hero after he was severely cut while helping stop a terror attack on a French train in August, was repeatedly stabbed in what police said was an alcohol-fueled, late-night brawl in a Sacramento nightclub district. \nOfficials said Stone was in intensive care following the fighting early Thursday but expected to fully recover. \n\"We know it's not related to what occurred in France,\" Sacramento Deputy Police Chief Ken Bernard said. \nStone was out with four friends when they got into a fight near a bar with another group of people, Bernard said. \nThe deputy chief would not disclose what sparked the argument but said there was no evidence the assailants knew who Stone was. \n--- \nHEALTHBEAT: Gene-editing research booming amid debate over how far to go in fighting disease \nWASHINGTON (AP) — The hottest tool in biology has scientists using words like revolutionary as they describe the long-term potential: wiping out certain mosquitoes that carry malaria, treating genetic diseases like sickle-cell, preventing babies from inheriting a life-threatening disorder. \nIt may sound sci-fi, but research into genome editing is booming. So is a debate about its boundaries, what's safe and what's ethical to try in the quest to fight disease. \nDoes the promise warrant experimenting with human embryos? Researchers in China already have, and they're poised to in Britain. \nShould we change people's genes in a way that passes traits to future generations? Beyond medicine, what about the environmental effects if, say, altered mosquitoes escape before we know how to use them? \n\"We need to try to get the balance right,\" said University of California, Berkeley, biochemist Jennifer Doudna. She helped develop new gene-editing technology and hears from desperate families, but urges caution in how it's eventually used in people. \n--- \nResearchers, food company look to serve consumers beef with a side of heart-healthy omega-3s \nWICHITA, Kan. (AP) — Health-conscious consumers might be persuaded to eat more beef if it was fortified with heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids naturally found in salmon and walnuts, according to researchers and some ranchers who are feeding cattle flaxseed — even marine algae — with an eye to offering another wholesome dinner choice. \nPeople have long been told they can decrease their risk of heart disease by eating more omega-3 fatty acids, the kind salmon get from algae. It inspired researchers at Kansas State University: Could the steaks and hamburgers from cattle fattened on algae pass on those healthy fats? \nSeparately, some Texas grocery stores are selling beef products fortified with omega-3 through flaxseed, a trial run so successful that orders have quadrupled since it began seven months ago. And a nationwide study shows consumers would be willing to pay $1.85 a pound more for enriched steaks and 79 cents a pound more for enhanced ground beef, Kansas State agricultural economist Sean Fox said. \nAfter putting a pot roast into her shopping basket at a Wichita grocery store, 31-year-old Lindsey Goodwin considered that very question. \"Probably, it kind of depends on the price,\" she said. \nBut Terry Cooper, 36, was skeptical, adding that the university might have an \"uphill battle\" persuading people to eat more beef. \"The reality is we all eat more junk food ... but we think we should eat healthy,\" Cooper said.
