Next up: The Duggars. \nAn episode next month of Law & Order SVU (Nov. 4, 9 pm ET, on NBC) is loosely based on the fecund family-values family of reality TV felled by sex scandals earlier this year. With twists, of course, just to make it interesting, and with disclaimers, just to cover themselves legally. \"Law & Order: SVU\" Will Take On the Duggars in a New Episode http://t.co/Vuv1APuuaZ — Law & Order SUV (@LawNOrderSUV) October 12, 2015 \nIt's a fiction formula that's worked for years: 20 seasons for the original L&O, and now going into 17 years for the Special Victims Unit spin-off, which focuses on sex crimes. \nIt was inevitable: The series' two-hour premiere episode last month was based on theRobert Durst case (New York real-estate heir suspected of murder) and The Jinx , HBO's documentary series based on the deeply strange story of Durst. \nAnd this week's episode, \"Community Policing\" (Oct. 4), sounds all-too-tragically familiar, too: The NYPD falls under seige after the shooting of an unarmed black man. Wednesday on #SVU , a country is divided. pic.twitter.com/eKyNXLpaim — Law and Order: SVU (@nbcsvu) October 12, 2015 \n\"In the pursuit of an SVU rape suspect, detectives from another precinct shoot and kill an unarmed black man. As racial tensions rise in the city, Barba (Raúl Esparza) is tasked to indict three officers who claim they had no choice but to follow police procedure,\" according to the show's description of the episode. \nThe Duggars were a juicy target for the ever-adapting writers of L&O, after the shocking fall of the family and the cancellation of their hugely popular series on cable network TLC, 19 Kids and Counting, this summer. \nIn the episode \"Patrimonial Burden,\" the squad investigates a famous reality TV family of 10 children after it's discovered the virtuous 13-year-old daughter is pregnant, according to the show's description of the episode. 'Raise them to breathe fire' post about Anna Duggar goes viral \nSo, not just the Duggars but a few allusions to the story of Sarah Palin's daughterBristol Palin, whose unwed teen pregnancy embarrassed mom during her 2008 vice-presidential race. (Bristol is about to be an unwed parent again with baby number two on the way.) 2005: The Duggar children and their father Jim Bob Duggar, top center, gather as their mother Michelle holds Johannah, the 16th addition to the family.
