Photo: Supplied \nBonnie Ashley and Neil Downie's Bonnie and Neil's homewares label now has a home.  The showroom, which opened in September, is tucked down a residential street in Brunswick and sits in front of their studio, where large windows provide a front-row seat to the practical business of screen-printing.\nBonnie and Neil's textiles, including tea towels, tablecloths, napkins, table runners and cushions in bright colours and intricate patterns have been a favourite of interior designers since the pair launched in Melbourne in 2010, and the showroom allows them to showcase their range in a proper setting. Their hand-printed wall tiles, limited edition art, and textiles sit beautifully with furniture by Grazia and Co – upholstered in Bonnie and Neil fabric – sculptures by Rob Bast, and Robert Gordon ceramics, featuring Bonnie and Neil's own designs.\nThat Ashley once worked as  a florist comes as no surprise: not only is the studio decorated with dramatic displays of flowers but floral themes work their way into many of the label's textiles, as a range of framed prints and on Robert Gordon's ceramics. \nIf an out-of-the-way Brunswick location is a deterrent, check out their Instagram account, where stunning images of the showroom and their products should be enough to convince you to make a beeline for this lovely store.\nAdvertisement Bonnie and Neil is at 121A Donald Street, Brunswick, 9384 2234. Open Thursday to Saturday 9.30am-5pm or by appointment. bonnieandneil.com.au .
