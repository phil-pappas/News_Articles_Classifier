Dumaplin\nOctober 21, 2015 Ai Ai delas Alas\nAi Ai delas Alas will star in Regal Entertainment’s Mother ’s Day offering in 2016. Shooting commences January.\nPlaying mother in movies or on TV is nothing new to the actress. One of her biggest hits is the “Tanging Ina” franchise, yet she said her movie with Regal will be different, as in “never ko pang nagawa sa buong buhay ko sa show business.”\nAi Ai said Jiro Manio will be cast in the film as her son. Recall that she was one of those who helped him recently during a troubled phase in his life, even taking him to a facility. Now, the actor is back on track and “bumabalik na ’yung interes niya (sa pag-aartista),” she said.\nThe actress revealed Jiro initially wanted to work in Japan (where his biological father resides), but she gently dissuaded him from doing so.\n“Sabi ko, ‘Anak, practicality-wise, hindi ka pwede kasi ’di ka marunong mag-Nihongo. Nandito ’yung talent mo sa Pilipinas, so dito ka muna. Then ’pag nakaipon ka na, tsaka kita dadalhin sa Japan,’” Ai Ai said.\nShe has portrayed a lot of different roles in the past but even at this point, there are other kinds she’s been eyeing. These include playing nun or prostitute, “Kung ano’ng kwento ang meron sila, ’yung mga pinagdadaanan nila, mga pagsubok.”\nRegal matriarch Lily Monteverde believes Ai Ai will continue to succeed in show business.\n“She’s a very nice person kaya naman mahal na mahal ko siya,” the lady producer was Quote: d to have said in a release.\nJiro Manio\nOther projects Ai Ai is part of are the ongoing TV shows “Sunday PinaSaya” and “CelebriTV,” and the Metro Manila Film Festival 2015 movie “My Bebe Love” with Vic Sotto and Alden Richards.\nIndeed, Ai Ai is blessed with the resurgence of her career. To think that early this year, she had thought of throwing the towel in and just live quietly abroad.\n“Kaya nga inayos ko ’yung green card ko eh, para samahan at alagaan ko na lang ’yung mga anak ko,” she said.\nBut she sought God’s help and He smiled on her yet again.\n“Sabi ko sa Diyos: ‘Kayo na po ang gumawa ng paraan kung ano man ’yung desisyon Niyo for me.’ And ito ’yung desisyon niya. Happy naman ako.” (With report from Jojo P.
