Photographers and filmmakers love the edgy styling, durable, water-repellent fabrics, Quick Access top zipper, and smartly designed interior organization. Regardless, Tenba received numerous requests for a silent opening option. “Everyone loves the security of velcro, but they hate the sound it makes,” says Peter Waisnor, Vice President of Tenba. “We searched for a solution that would allow the bag to close securely, but still enable the user to open it silently. We found our solution in a velcro developed for the military, so that soldiers could open packs and pockets in the field without drawing attention.”\nBy pulling down on the front flap before pulling away from the bag, the velcro will disengage with almost no sound, enabling unobstructed access to the interior, even when the shooting environment requires discretion and quiet.\nIn addition to the new Quiet Velcro, Tenba has added olive green, cobalt blue and dark copper colorways to the original graphite gray option. These rich, jewel-tone colors are appropriately subtle for a professional bag, but still look beautiful.\nThe Messenger DNA bags continue to feature Tenba’s abrasion and moisture resistant body armor base panel, silver/black reversible WeatherWrap rain cover, removable padded camera insert, and security strap for bicyclists. The new bags are shipping now, with retail prices of $89.95 for the DNA 8 , $139.95 for the DNA 11 , $159.95 for the DNA 13 and $169.95 for the DNA 15 .\nAbout Tenba\nSince 1977, Tenba has been making innovative carrying case solutions for professional photographers and filmmakers - and their full equipment arsenal.
