Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly will reprise their roles as Scott Lang a.k.a. Ant-Man and Hope Van Dyne respectively. The upcoming movie will reportedly feature Van Dyne taking up her mother's heroic mantle as the Wasp. Plot details are still scarce and no writers have been set for the sequel. Reed signed on to direct \"Ant-Man\" just before the movie started shooting when director Edgar Wright exited the project due to creative differences. Adam McKay and Rudd then came on board, revising Wright and Joe Cornish's existing script to fit Reed's vision. Marvel recently pushed back some of their movies to give room for \"Ant-Man and the Wasp\", which is scheduled to hit U.S. theaters on July 6, 2018. The studio pushed back \" Black Panther \" to February 16, 2018 and \" Captain Marvel \" to March 8, 2019. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Ant-Man and the Wasp News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T05:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:50:53.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
