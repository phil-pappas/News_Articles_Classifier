I think everyone's had their moment on tequila over the years, but when you get older, you appreciate it a bit more,\" David told Conde Nast Traveller magazine, reports femalefirst.co.uk.\nDavid also says that he is better at packing for trips than his fashion designer wife because he is always organised and well-prepared.\n\"I'm one of the best packers you will probably ever meet. I'm obsessed with being ready and having everything in place. I'm very well-prepared for any trip that's coming up. I have friends that take the mickey out of me for it, and my wife is a last-minute packer and nowhere near as organised as me,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:06:03.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
