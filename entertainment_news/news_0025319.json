Pollard High School in Corona evacuated Tuesday, Oct. 20 after receiving a bomb threat.\nThough the school day was cut short, nobody was injured, said Corona-Norco Unified School District spokeswoman Evita Gonzales.\n\"All are safe and accounted for,\" Gonzales said.\nBy 1:36 p.m., students with cars were allowed into the school's parking lot. School at that time had been let out for the day, following its normal bell schedule.\nSchool administrators received the threat at 12:07 p.m., said Sgt. Paul Mercado of the Corona Police Department. The caller, who has not been identified, said there was a bomb on campus.\nSoon after, Mercado said, administrators received another call. This time, the caller said the bomb would go off in 5 minutes. That's when administrators decided to evacuate the school to a nearby park.\nAt 1 p.m., the school remained closed as officers investigated the scene. Parents may pick up their children at South Hills Church at 2585 South Main St., Mercado said. A photo ID is required to pick up your child.\nThe Corona-Norco Unified School District sent out text message and voicemail notifications to parents, informing them of the situation, Gonzales said.\nCorona resident Veronica Bender received a text alert from the school about the bomb threat, and went to South Hills Church to pick up her son, Justin.\nSimilar inicdents that have occurred recently in Corona left her asking questions.\n\"I'm just wondering what's going on with all these bomb threats,\" Bender said. Said she was happy they got the kids out of the school and across the street.\nLarry Trejo, of Corona, went to South Hills Church Tuesday afternoon to pick up his granddaughter, Karen.

Pollard senior Maykenzie Verni was eating lunch when teachers started telling students to leave the lunchroom. The students stood outside of the school for a few minutes before going across the street to the church.\n\"I felt like the school could blow up at any minute, it was kind of scary,\" Verni said. \"People like to mess around.\"\nThis story is developing.
