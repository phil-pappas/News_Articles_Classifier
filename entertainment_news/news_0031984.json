For decades, the city of Riverside did all it could to ensure American Medical Response maintained a monopoly on nonemergency medical ambulance services. There never was a legitimate reason why AMR was the only company allowed to engage in interfacility transports – the city was the only one in the county to prevent competition. It simply boiled down to crony capitalism.\nThat stranglehold on the market was enshrined in the Municipal Code, with bizarre requirements that competitors, before they could do business, could not impair AMR and must provide the city a “need and necessity” for their services. Given these barriers, qualified applicants routinely were rejected by the council.\nBut nonsensical policies can only last for so long. Competition finally was opened in January, with four companies allowed to operate in the city. A Sept. 10 report informing the city on how this novel dynamic has played out revealed what everyone should have known: People like having options. In fact, queried hospitals and nursing facilities indicated they wanted even more choice.\nOn Wednesday, the city’s Public Safety Committee considered an application from another potential service provider, Premier Medical Transport, to work in Riverside. After consulting health providers in the city and evaluating the record of the company, the Fire Department recommended approval of the city’s franchise request. Three hospitals and six nursing facilities surveyed by the Fire Department overwhelmingly indicated a preference for more options, and there was nothing about PMT that raised red flags.\nThe committee, made up of Councilmembers Andy Melendrez, Jim Perry and John Burnard, approved moving the application to the full City Council, as suggested by Fire Chief Michael Moore.\nDisappointingly, the city still has some work to do before we can confidently say it has moved beyond its protectionist past. Applicants still must demonstrate there is a “need” for their ambulance service. Whether companies are “needed” isn’t for City Hall to determine, but for the market. In time, Riverside must purge such language from its Municipal Code and treat the non-emergency ambulance market like the rest of the county does, without excessive red tape.\nWRITE A LETTER TO THE EDITOR: Letters to the Editor: E-mail to letters@pe.com .
