She said that after speaking with her staff, Zendaya and Zendaya's parents, Modeliste pulled the issue.\n\"[We] specifically chose Zendaya as our Cover Model for the issue as we have a deep respect and admiration for her openness, honesty, the genuine manner in which she connects with her loyal fan base, as well as her integrity,\" said McCabe. \"We believe her to be an authentic and positive representative and an inspiration to women and of the values which we at Modeliste also hold.\"\nThis isn't the first time Zendaya has stood up for herself. She hit back at Giuliana Rancic after the E! correspondent made a comment about her hair, saying, \"Studies have shown that even though we try to act without prejudice, sometimes it's just hidden inside us due to our past or surroundings. That hidden prejudice is often influential in our actions. It's our job to spot these issues within others and ourselves and destroy them before they become hurtful.\"\nHad a new shoot come out today and was shocked when I found my 19 year old hips and torso quite manipulated.
