'Back to the Future' stars then and now \nWednesday marks the unofficial celebration of \"Back to the Future\" Day, the Oct. 21, 2015, date that Marty McFly travels to in 1989's \"Back to the Future Part II.\" To mark the occasion, check up on the stars of the blockbuster film series. \n\"Back to the Future\" Day is Wednesday, and fans are tallying up the 1989 film's predictions of life in the year 2015. \nHow did the movie do?

Welcome, 'Back to the Future' Day \n\"Back to the Future\" Day has finally arrived. \nIn \"Back to the Future Part II,\" Marty McFly travels to October 21, 2015, to save his children, yet to be born in \"Back to the Future's\" 1985. \nThe plot gets tangled -- by fixing one thing, McFly and Doc Br... More \nThe company appears to have quickly sold out of \"Pepsi Perfect,\" its homage to \"Back to the Future,\" leaving legions of fans disappointed. \nPepsi said it would release 6,500 bottles of Pepsi Perfect to fans in the U.S. on Tuesday evening. But some fans said they were unable to buy the soda, leading to outrage on social media. \nThe soda was featured in the 1989 film \"Back to the Future Part 2,\" a story that transported characters Marty McFly and Dr. Emmet Brown to Oct. 21, 2015. \nThe collectible \"Pepsi Perfect\" was selling for $20.15, and featured the same 16.9 ounce bottle that McFly orders at Hill Valley's futuristic \"Caf√© 80's.\" \nSome reviewers on Amazon, which also sold the beverage, were unhappy with the situation. \n\"Not happy with the release,\" wrote reviewer JacquelineS. \"What's the point in all the hype just to disappoint customers and fans?\" \n\"Stayed up hoping I could snag one at MIDNIGHT...even after following them on twitter and trying every link....seems like these were sold out before anyone could actually buy them..very disappointing. Looks like I will continue to NOT drink pepsi,\" wrote reviewer Tyler. \nPepsi did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T21:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:31:11.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
