I met him when he had the increased weight and his face and his jawline were like doughy flesh, so he will always be David to me.\"\nBehold 'David'.\nAt the risk of sounding crass, I still totally would. It's all in the eyes, you see, and Faddler has a lovely pair on him.\nAs it turns out, Colin wasn't as much of a fan of his increased weight: \"It was not really a joy because you're just eating for eight weeks. I didn't want to put on weight because I didn't want to work to lose it, so I was saying to Yorgos, 'What about if he's really thin?' Because I did want to alter my physicality somewhat.\" That obviously didn't fly.\nSee all the photos from night's red carpet extravaganza on Leicester Square below.\nVia The Independent\nMORE: Watch: First trailer for 'The Lobster' starring Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz\nMORE: An Irish Hollywood A-lister is on The Late Late Show this Friday\nREAD: The Lobster - Movie Review", "external_links": ["http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/movies/movie-news/rachel-weisz-on-colin-farrell-his-face-was-like-doughy-flesh-when-we-first-met-and-hell-always-be-that-man-to-me-31608234.html"], "published": "2015-10-14T17:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:43:01.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
