How it all started on BGT \n\"I would recommend these classes to anyone, they are so much fun and the kids had a fantastic time.\" \nAshley Glazebrook, known as Twist, and Glen Murphy, known as Pulse, met at the BRIT School, where they worked on the formation that brought them the success they have enjoyed since taking part in Britain’s Got Talent. \nTheir blend of street dance and comedy proved a hit with judges on the show and the public.
