Photo: Chris Reardon / Crown Media Tom Selleck cranky, but comforting, as Jesse Stone 1 / 5 Back to Gallery Judging by the uproar I hear any time CBS’ “Blue Bloods” gets pre-empted by a Spurs game, not to mention the queries I regularly receive from people who sorely miss the Jesse Stone movies, Tom Selleck continues to be a big favorite in San Antonio.\nIt’s easy to see why after watching him in the latest mystery thriller in the Stone franchise.\nYes, you heard me. After a three-year hiatus, Selleck and his signature cranky and damaged police gumshoe are back.\nAfter CBS passed on doing more Jesse Stone, Crown Media Family Networks , which already runs marathons of these movies to enthusiastic response, came to the rescue.\n“Jesse Stone: Lost in Paradise,” the ninth in the series, will premiere at 8 p.m. Sunday on Hallmark Channel. It airs again at 8 p.m. Oct. 25 on Hallmark Movies & Mysteries channel, preceded by a string of past Stone flicks.\nSeveral staples return alongside Selleck, including Gloria Reuben (“Mr. Robot”) as the jazz singer with whom Jesse got intimate in the past and carries a torch for still. William Devane also reprises his role as Dr. Dix, the effectively frank therapist who helps Jesse work through emotional problems frequently fueled by too much scotch.\nGuest stars include former “90210” heartthrob Luke Perry in an uncharacteristic role. He’s a serial killer.\nAs usual, however, it’s Selleck who commands the screen with the subdued intensity he’s brought to the title character for 10 years.\nAt 70, he is still one of the most handsome and charismatic actors around. Those famous dimples have only deepened with age, and the rugged cheek crevices add even more interest to his face.\nThe movie, once again, is inspired by the writings of Robert B. Parker , executive-produced by Selleck, who plays the police chief in a fictional Massachusetts town called Paradise.\nMaybe it’s the moody music, the muted photography or the deliberately slow pace. There’s something oddly comforting about this series, even when the killings at each chapter’s core are horrific, such as the central homicide in “Lost in Paradise.”\nThe movie opens with Jesse feeling so restless he’s drinking more than he should. He’s done too effective a job cleaning up crime in Paradise.\nHe lives alone in a cozy home by the sea, continues to be hung up on his ex-wife and doesn’t even have Reggie, his beloved golden retriever — “my conscience” is what Jesse called him — for company. (Joe the Dog, who portrayed Reggie, died in 2013.)\nA technology dinosaur, Jesse never texts and he abhors Facebook and similar sites.\n“The average kid on social media has the attention span of eight seconds; that’s one second less than a goldfish,” he grumbles.\nRealizing he needs an absorbing case to sink his teeth into, he takes the train into Boston to consult with assistant state homicide commander Sydney Greenstreet ( Leslie Hope ), another old paramour. She hands him a stack of cold cases, which includes the recent murder of a woman named Mavis that many believe already has been solved.\nHowever, Jesse’s instincts tell him otherwise, and a jailhouse visit with the suspect — a scuzzy killer of women known as “The Boston Ripper” (Perry) — cements this feeling. He denies responsibility for Mavis, even though she, like the other victims, was carved up in the Ripper’s trademark style.\nJesse’s biggest motivation doesn’t come from a human, however. Instead, he’s tugged by an Irish setter named Steve, Mavis’ dog, who’s now a ward of Boston Animal Services . Told that Steve has issues and likely will be put down, Jesse takes him home, and yes, the heartbroken dog serves as his new “conscience.”\nIn fact, the scenes with the pooch are some of the most memorable as we’re taken on a twisty-turny path toward Mavis’ killer.\nAlong the way, Jesse befriends and helps a 13-year-old girl whose mother is plagued by addiction problems that, as we know by now, our protagonist has been familiar with much of his adult life.\n“Lost in Paradise” is a decent whodunit, but the beauty of the movie, as always, lies with its deliciously melancholy execution and, of course, Selleck’s layered and quietly magnetic performance, which once again adds to his status as one of TV’s stalwart greats.\nJeanne Jakle ’s column appears Wednesdays and Sundays in mySA, and she blogs at Jakle’s Jacuzzi on mySA.com.
