They still act like they are in the honeymoon phase.'' \nJustin previously admitted that he finds being apart from Jennifer ''horrible''. \nThe 44-year-old actor and screenwriter has been working in Texas for new movie 'Zoolander 2' and admitted he doesn't enjoy being away from the 'Cake' actress but they ''work'' around it. \nJustin shared: ''It's horrible being apart from your spouse. She's been here a bunch of times and visited, I sneak back when I can go see her - we make it work. \n''We FaceTime, we call and text but when you're on set, the hours are so long, so you're really waiting for the weekend where you can depressurise and have longer conversations.'' \nHowever even with thousands of miles between them, the handsome actor is just happy to be finally married to the 46-year-old actress after a three-year engagement. \nShortly after they tied the knot, Justin revealed: ''It's fantastic. Something really does shift in a wonderful way and it refocuses things and in a weird way, it was a long time coming.''
