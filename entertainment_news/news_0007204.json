Sam Hunt, Nicki Minaj, Sam Smith, Meghan Trainor and Walk the Moon had three nominations each.\nSwift was one of 10 nominees for artist of the year, and her \"Blank Space\" was nominated for song of the year.

Whitney Houston's 21 awards are the most ever among female artists in the show, which was launched in 1974. Michael Jackson's 24 awards are the most of any artist.\nNominations, announced Tuesday, are based on a metric that includes sales, airplay and social activity tracked by Billboard magazine and its partners. Winners are determined by fan votes on the show's website or through Facebook and Twitter.\nSwift, Sheeran, the Weeknd, Minaj, Trainor, Smith, Luke Bryan, Ariana Grande, Maroon 5 and One Direction are artist of the year nominees. The nomination list will be narrowed to five by Nov. 11 through fan votes.\nJennifer Lopez will host the show, which will air live Nov. 22 from the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles on ABC.\nBesides \"Blank Space,\" song of the year nominees are \"See You Again\" by Wiz Khalifa featuring Charlie Puth; \"Uptown Funk!\" by Mark Ronson featuring Bruno Mars; \"Thinking out Loud\" by Sheeran; and \"Can't Feel My Face\" by the Weeknd.\nSheeran's \"x'' and Smith's \"In the Lonely Hour\" join \"1989\" in the competition for best album.
