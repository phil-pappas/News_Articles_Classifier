Some of the apples in both groups had dipping sticks, and others did not.\nAfter three days, the amount of listeria on unrefrigerated apples with sticks increased 1,000-fold, while listeria growth on unrefrigerated apples without sticks was delayed, the investigators found.\nRefrigerated apples with sticks had no listeria growth for a week but then had some growth over the next three weeks. Refrigerated apples without sticks had no listeria growth over four weeks, the findings showed.\nThe study was published online Oct. 13 in the journal mBio.\nBecause caramel has a low amount of water and apples are acidic, neither is a normal breeding ground for listeria, explained study author Kathleen Glass, associate director of the Food Research Institute at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.\nBut piercing an apple with a dipping stick causes a bit of apple juice to leak out and become trapped under a layer of caramel, creating an environment that aids the growth of listeria already present on the apple's surface, Glass explained.\nThis growth occurs much more quickly when a caramel apple is stored at room temperature compared with refrigeration, she said.\nTo be safe, you should buy refrigerated caramel apples or eat them fresh, Glass advised.\nIn 2014, prepackaged caramel apples from three manufacturers were linked to a listeriosis outbreak in which 35 people in 12 states were infected and seven died, the researchers said.\nListeriosis symptoms include fever, headache, stiff neck and gastrointestinal problems, and the study authors noted that symptoms may not surface for several weeks after eating contaminated foods.\n Diseases and Illnesses", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561e9f47/turbine/sc-caramel-apples-listeria-health-1014-20151014"], "published": "2015-10-14T22:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:29:36.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
