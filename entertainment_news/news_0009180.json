On Saturday, Rose marched the streets of downtown LA to highlight gender inequality and to promote \"a zero tolerance policy on all hateful language, racism, sexism, ableism, fat-shaming, transphobia, or any other kind of bigotry.\"\nAccording to Mashable , this isn't the first march of its kind: \"Several have taken place over the years in various locations, including Toronto, New York City and Washington, D.C. The demonstrations began after a Toronto cop said women shouldn't dress like sluts if they don't want to be victimized.\"\nRose has been bringing attention to the issue of inequality for some time - especially since starring in that recent Funny or Die video.\nSocial media was awash with photos from the march, many of which suffered negative comments as a result.\n#amberroseslutwalk ðŸ˜ÂÂÂÂðŸ˜ÂÂÂÂðŸ˜ÂÂÂÂðŸ™Œ pic.twitter.com/CZOEpAy21F\n— Amber Rose (@DaRealAmberRose) October 3, 2015 Supporting women's rights w @DaRealAmberRose @maggiegeha #SlutWalk ðŸ'ŠðŸ'ŠðŸ'Š ðŸ'¯ pic.twitter.com/p3uY3stBKJ\n— Andrea Feczko (@AndreaFeczko) October 3, 2015\nAll the tweets trashing the women who attended #SlutWalk sicken me.

Cole (@RantingOwl) October 3, 2015 Speaking of which, Matt McGorry of OITKB (who's highlighted gender inequality before by posting female nipples to his own on Instagram), also took part in the event, encouraging white men - \"the people who are historically the oppressors\" - to fight sexism.\nThe below video was posted captioned: \"Another portion of @mattmcgorry speaking today at @amberrose #amberroseslutwalk event - I would like to challenge men and women of all cultures to take this example and stand up for something bigger than OURself. Start by getting to know other cultures. Go out of your way. Get uncomfortable. I believe some of the the solutions to problems we have in our communities and cultures can be found outside of our communities. Can help fight ignorance and help change negative stereotypes as well.\"\nMORE: Amber Rose has new long brunette hair - is spit of Kim Kardashian...\nMORE: Watch: Miley describes herself as an 'international phenomenon' on Fallon.
