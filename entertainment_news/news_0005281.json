The Discovery Channel longest-running series will premiere its 14th and final season on January 9, 2016. Hosts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman will say goodbye to the series after 248 episodes and 2,950 experiments. Discovery is not closing the door on future \"Mythbusters\" revival, but for now the series is over. Adam and Jamie are working on a spy drama project at CBS based on their personal experiences. The duo will serve as executive producers. Rich Ross, group president of Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and Science Channel, said in a statement, \" 'Mythbusters' is - and will always be - an incredibly important part of Discovery's history. Adam and Jamie are enormous talents who have brought learning and science to the forefront of this network, and their legacy will continue to live on over at Science Channel. The 'Mythbusters' library will be moving over to Discovery's sister network in 2016, where I know audiences new and old alike will be able to experience and learn with Adam and Jamie and the rest of the 'Mythbusters' family.\" Adam said, \"Making 'Mythbusters' has fundamentally and irrevocably altered the way I think as a person, as an artist, and as a scientist. I'm glad for the chance to say goodbye with some of the best television we've ever made. I will miss making this show.\" Jamie added, \"I never dreamed we would be on television at all, much less for such a long time and with so much praise for keeping a thought provoking show on the air. And best of all, we were able to do what we do and still have all our fingers and toes.\" Science Channel will air every previous episode of \"Mythbusters\" in a marathon beginning on December 23. Premiered in January 2003, the show have explored 1050 myths with guest stars included Seth Rogen , James Cameron, Aaron Paul , Vince Gilligan, Sophia Bush and President Barrack Obama. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:51:41.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
