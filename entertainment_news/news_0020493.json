Los Angeles-based comedian Satyal was very excited that he got to perform for Modi at the SAP Center. After opening for the likes of Russell Peters, it was one big, proud moment for him.\n\"He (Satyal) spoke to me before the event and was very excited about it. He has been a good friend and even after achieving many milestones in his career, this one will remain special for him. And I think not just him, it was a proud moment for all of us to see a stand-up comedian taking centrestage at such an event,\" says stand-up comedian Atul Khatri. He adds that this has set a very good example, especially for India, where stand-up comedy is usually seen only at small gatherings inside restaurants and pubs.\nStand-up comics are now perfect hosts/emcees\nAfter establishing their ability to keep an audience engaged with their humour, stand-up comics have now also secured their position as hosts at major award shows and events, replacing emcees. \"Humour has become an important part of every field now. What a stand-up comic can do on stage can't be done by emcees, who go by fixed lines and rarely have anything new to offer to the audience. We write our own script as per the nature of the event.\nWe can change the script on stage, without making it obvious to the audience, in case there is some change of plan. We aim at making the show or event interactive, so even a boring award function turns into an entertaining one. I recently hosted an annual award show for the rubber industry. The response I received from the audience was overwhelming. Guests often tell me that corporate events and award functions are boring, formal events and stand-up comedians are now being preferred as hosts to keep the show entertaining and interactive,\" says stand-up comic Atul Khatri.\nPapa CJ, who has hosted many national and international events, says that a stand-up comedian is not just a guy who stands with a mic and throws around abuses in a bar. \"There has been a change, and stand-up comedians have proved their mettle. Rajiv Satyal is an example and I, too, recently performed in South Africa in the presence of dignitaries from across the world and received a standing ovation. When this is already happening across the world, I see no reason why stand-up comics should not be rated over emcees to open high-profile events and functions here.\"\nEven some in politics encourage comedy at events\nAmong many other memorable performances in his career so far, Appurv Gupta distinctly remembers one where he performed in the presence of Uma Bharti. \"I feel proud of the fact that sab theek ho gaya and kisi ko kisi baat ka bura nahi laga,\" says Gupta, and adds that he was pleasantly surprised to notice that there are people in the political field who encourage stand-up comedy acts at major events. \"At such events, one has to follow certain norms, but stand-up comedy is increasingly becoming part of political gatherings. And I think in this case, the change started happening in small towns.\"\nRaju Shrivastav has been participating in political rallies and entertaining people for many years now. The change is now visible in cities where stand-up comics are in demand for functions or events related to some government organisations. Young politicians are very much open to the idea of stand-up comedy. Rajiv Satyal's opening act before PM Narendra Modi's speech at the SAP Center in San Jose has set a very good example to encourage stand-up comedy in India,\" says Gupta.\nPracticing humour with restraint?\nWhile there is no denying that more avenues are opening up for stand-up comedians, when it comes to their participation in political or cultural events, organisers have to think twice before taking a decision. \"Yes, it is true that we are now getting prominent parts to play at big award shows and high-profile events, we are not called in as fillers in between the main event. However, we have to practice restrictions. Even in corporate events, we are given a huge list of dos and don'ts to follow. And if there are any political parties involved, people have to think twice before taking any decisions, as they think ye stage pe kuch bhi bol dega aur meri naukri chali jayegi. Only a few people have that kind of patience to treat humour as humour and not get serious about the jokes cracked. Obama is such a good example of this. I think that kind of change is yet to come about here,\" says stand-up comedian Neeti Palta.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T19:29:16.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
