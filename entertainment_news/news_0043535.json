So far it is unclear if the layoffs will include Twitter's Boulder office at 1050 Walnut St. \nThe social media giant moved into town last year when it acquired Gnip, a Boulder-based firm that provides real-time data from social networking sites. \nIn a Form 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Tuesday morning the company confirmed its plans to reduce its global workforce by 8 percent. \"On Oct.12, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a restructuring and reduction in force plan of up to 336 employees, constituting approximately 8 percent of the Company's global workforce,\" the document stated. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey commented on the job cuts via his Twitter feed. \"Made some tough but necessary decisions that enable Twitter to move with greater focus and reinvest in our growth,\" Dorsey stated. The SEC filing did not specify which departments or locations would be impacted. An employee reached at Twitter's Boulder office would not comment on the layoffs or if local employees would be affected. Twitter stated that it plans to \"reinvest savings in its most important priorities to drive growth.\" It will incur between $10 million and $20 million in severance and related costs. In a letter to staff, Dorsey spoke of the difficult decision. Advertisement \"So we have made an extremely tough decision: we plan to part ways with up to 336 people from across the company. We are doing this with the utmost respect for each and every person. Twitter will go to great lengths to take care of each individual by providing generous exit packages and help finding a new job,\" the CEO wrote. \nAt the market close Tuesday, Twitter was at $29.06 a share, up .31 for the day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T00:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T09:49:29.274+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
