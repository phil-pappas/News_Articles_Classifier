They're hanging out in a giant rock quarry and this, apparently, is the why the area around Alexandria has been relatively zombie-free. All the walkers are going to Woodstock! \nSomeone blocked the roads out of the quarry with semi trucks. But the holding pen is being overrun and is weakening. And unless someone has a crazy plan to stop them, the so-called \"safe zone\" won't be so safe anymore. Tovah Feldshuh as Deanna Monroe and Andrew Lincoln as Rick Grimes in 'The Walking Dead.' (Gene Page/AMC) (Gene Page/AMC) \nEnter Rick Grimes. Our man of action has just such a crazy plan. Doesn't he always? It's hard to adequately describe this plan, but it involves leading a huge parade of walkers westward, along a country road and away from Alexandria, with flares and cars, etc. etc. \nNot everyone thinks this is a solid strategy. The main dissenter is a guy named Carter, who has been on Rick's back ever since that little town-hall meeting turned deadly. Carter thinks Rick needs to be put down like a wounded horse. He questions Rick's mental stability. But Rick just grows more defiant. \n\"I know this is insane, but this is an INSANE world,\" he snarls. \"We have to come for them before they come for us!\" Advertisement \nSunday's opener, titled \"First Time Again,\" is both intensely riveting and creatively ambitious. It unfolds in two narrative threads -- one filmed in black-and-white -- and it plays with time and structure in an interesting way. \nAs the episode unfolds, it becomes quickly apparent that folks are eyeing Rick warily -- even some in his group. Good ol' Morgan Jones, for example, is having a difficult time believing that this guy who fought with and then killed Pete is the same Rick he met back in the day in King County. This \"new\" Rick seems more vicious and coldhearted. And when Rick steps in to prevent the Gabriel from burying Pete's corpse (\"We're not going to bury killers within these walls\"), Morgan reminds him that they are both killers, too. \n\"That's not who you are, Rick,\" Morgan says later when Rick suggests they just dump the body in the woods. \"I know.\" \n\"You don't,\" Rick replies. \nThe Rick-Morgan dynamic is one of the more intriguing aspects of Season 6 so far. Two reunited friends who have changed over time (Check out Morgan's mad skills with a big wooden stick!). They really don't know each other any more and they're sizing each other up. There's tension in the air and it doesn't help matters when Morgan watches Rick kill Carter in the woods while the crazy plan is being carried out. Yes, Carter had already been bitten in the face by a walker, so he was a goner anyway. And yes, Rick put him down to keep Carter's screams from attracting the zombie horde, but still ... \nIn Rick's way of thinking, there's no more room for softness, hesitation and second-thinking. He has watched too many friends die. And so he has adopted this us-or-them mentality. \n\"I don't take chances anymore,\" he explains. \nThat's why he's working hard to train the Alexandria citizens in the fine art of zombie combat (They pretty much suck at it so far). They need to get tougher and step up their game -- especially now that Wolves (mysterious folks with W's carved into their foreheads) seem to be at their door. \nSasha, for one, is all in. She totally embraces Rick's wild zombie-diversion plan. \n\"Doing something as big as this -- that's living,\" she explains to Abraham, who has been hitting the bottle and is acting as weird as ever. \nAlas, that plan experiences major difficulty when a loud, droning horn suddenly pierces the Virginia air and catches the attention of the zombies, diverting them from where Rick and company are trying to lead them. Where is that noise coming from? Who's making it? Everyone wants to know. \nAs the episode draws to a close, a stunning aerial shot informs us that the zombie mob is headed straight for Alexandria! \nSome random notes and observations: \n-- Wow, wasn't it nice to get back to the feeling of frantic, relentless intensity after the relative sluggishness of \"Fear the Walking Dead\"? \n-- Still, some comic relief is always welcome. And so we cracked up when Eugene visited an on-the-mend Tara and the latter remarked, \"Thank God nothing happened to your hair!\" \n-- It was good to see, also, that they episode carved out just a little time to peek in on how things are between Rick and Pete's widow Jessie. Naturally, their bond has been damaged and who knows if it can be mended? Dating during a zombie apocalypse dating can be difficult. \n-- Only a small amount of Daryl in this episode, but he has a fairly significant disagreement with Rick. Daryl wants to continue recruiting outsiders to Alexandria, but Rick wants to close ranks. Who's right? \n-- Along those same lines, so far, a grieving Deanna has pretty much gone along with Rick's proposals. What will happen when she doesn't, if ever? Will there be a power struggle in Alexandria? \n-- We have a new character. Please welcome Heath to the proceedings. And more subtle comedy: \"Anything big happen while I was gone?\" \n-- Still, we have yet to solve the biggest mystery of Season 6: Who took Morgan's protein bar? \nSo what did you think of the opener? Are you still all in like Sasha? Or after five seasons, is this show dead to you?
