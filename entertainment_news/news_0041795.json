Featuring extensive unseen archival footage and previously unheard tracks, this strikingly modern, moving and vital film shines a light on our culture and the world we live in today. A once-in-a-generation talent, Amy Winehouse was a musician that captured the world's attention with her unforgettable voice and charisma. A pure jazz artist in the most authentic sense, Amy poured her heart and soul into her music, expressing personal struggles and pain through her intimate lyrics. The combination of her raw honesty and virtuosity resulted in some of the most unique and adored songs of our time. Amy became an international sensation, experiencing a meteoric rise to fame she had never sought nor expected. The relentless and invasive media attention, coupled with Amy's troubled relationships and additions, led her unto a tragic cycle of self-destruction, resulting in her untimely death at age 27. Four years later, Asif Kapadia's powerful documentary invites audiences to remember and celebrate Amy as a brilliant artist while asking ourselves how it was that we watched her disappear in front of our eyes.\nABOUT DICK CLARK PRODUCTIONS \ndick clark productions (dcp) is the world's largest producer and proprietor of televised live event entertainment programming with the \"Academy of Country Music Awards,\" \"American Country Countdown Awards,\" \"American Music Awards,\" \"Billboard Music Awards,\" \" Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest ,\" \"Golden Globe Awards,\" \"Hollywood Film Awards\" and the \"Streamy Awards.\" Weekly television programming includes \"So You Think You Can Dance\" from 19 Entertainment, a division of CORE Media Group and dcp; \"World's Funniest\" from Jukin Media and dcp; as well as \"BOOM!\" from Keshet DCP, the joint venture between Keshet International (KI), the global distribution and production arm of Keshet Media Group and DC Media, the parent company of dcp. dcp also owns one of the world's most unique and extensive entertainment archive libraries with more than 55 years of award-winning shows, historic programs, specials, performances and legendary programming.
