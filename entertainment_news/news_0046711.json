The actress, who is currently on an experimental immunotherapy treatment, asks those affected by the disease to focus on the present and stay strong.\n\"My advice would be to not wait for anything. Be present with your condition. On days you are feeling unwell, give yourself that time, that space. Respect yourself. You think that you are alone but you are not. Try to look at it as a gift to open another side of your mind and body,\" she says. The actress says there were days she felt alone. \"There were times when I wished if someone who could give me some strength would have called. I am sure many of them are silently screaming,\" she explains.\nMamta says that the most important thing for those fighting cancer is a strong support system. \"I would encourage people who are around them to just keep loving them because what they are going to get in return later on is just limitless,\" she says.\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-06T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T10:18:32.647+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
