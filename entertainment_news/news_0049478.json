Yep, the soapy TV drama made its debut in 1990, introducing us to Brenda and Brandon Walsh, a set of teen twins recently transplanted from wholesome Minnesota to flashy Beverly Hills. \nTo commemorate, Lifetime did what it does best (worst??) -- recently, at least -- and on Saturday aired an unauthorized TV movie about the show's behind-the-scenes drama. But what really has people talking is the one-hour sit- down with series star Tori Spelling that aired afterwards. \nIn it, she dished on the real behind-the-scenes drama, and we learned: \nShe had a summer fling with co-star Jason Priestley. \n\"It was our version of, like, a summer romance, the 90210 version and that was it,\" she said. \"You know, we stayed great friends for the rest of the run, and beyond that, but yeah, we had that one summer fling.\" \nBut contrary to rumors, she never tried to sell Priestley's wedding invitation at a garage sale. \"I would never do that,\" she said. \"I think the world of his wife and him and I am terribly mortified and embarrassed if that ever happened, and if it did, it was literally as a joke. I wasn't trying to make money off his wedding invitation.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T13:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:41:57.455+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
