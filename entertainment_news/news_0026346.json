They end up sitting down together tonight and admit there is no good in their relationship and they can't continue like this anymore. Ah here, but they love each other! They will probably just pull Niamh and Paul on it though and be back together within the year. Speaking of, Niamh comes to a decision tonight and decides to give it a go with Paul, although she has some conditions. Elsewhere, Debbie has a run in with Cathal tonight as he implies the cuts were her idea in a staff meeting and later makes it clear that she is responsible for Tommy. Is it just us, or are you predicting an affair between Debbie and Tommy?
