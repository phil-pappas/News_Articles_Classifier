Eleven took him up on the offer. \nWhile the exhibition acknowledges and pays heed to the region’s conflicts, it asks that viewers look beyond this to observe the dozen contemporary photographic viewpoints of Israel and the West Bank, created primarily between 2009 and 2012, according to a release. \n“When what is at stake is sharing the origin,” says Brenner in a statement, “it seems to me necessary to gather a large spectrum of individuals whose origins, passions, and paradoxical and contradictory perspectives could help us grasp the unbearable complexity of this place and its voices.” \nParticipating photographers were Brenner (France), Wendy Ewald (United States), Martin Kollar (Slovakia), Josef Koudelka (Czech Republic), Jungjin Lee (S. Korea), Gilles Peress (France), Fazal Sheikh (United States), Stephen Shore (United States), Rosalind Fox Solomon (United States), Thomas Struth (Germany), Jeff Wall (Canada) and Nick Waplington (United Kingdom). \nBrenner is scheduled to give a lecture at 6:30 p.m. Thursday during Art After Dark, and he returns on Nov. 19 for a presentation with other participating photographers. \nIF YOU GO \n“This Place: Israel Through Photography’s Lens” \nWhen: Thursday to Jan. 17; closed Mondays \nWhere: Norton Museum of Art, West Palm Beach \nCost: Adults, $12; students, $5; children 12 and under, free.
