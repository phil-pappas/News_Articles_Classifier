At a technical level, we are showing that it’s becoming possible for computer vision techniques alone to be used for this,” he said. \nThe group believes they have gathered the largest annotated dataset of first-person images to demonstrate that deep-learning can understand human behaviour and the habits of a specific person.The ability to literally see and recognise human activities has implications in a number of areas – from developing improved personal assistant applications like Siri to helping researchers explain links between health and behaviour, Thomaz said.Researchers believe that someday within the next decade we will have ubiquitous devices that can improve our personal choices throughout the day. \n“Imagine if a device could learn what I would be doing next – ideally predict it – and recommend an alternative?” said Daniel Casto, a PhD candidate in Computer Science and a lead researcher on the project.”Once it builds your own schedule by knowing what you are doing, it might tell you there is a traffic delay and you should leave sooner or take a different route,” he said. \n  4:23 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T13:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:58:55.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
