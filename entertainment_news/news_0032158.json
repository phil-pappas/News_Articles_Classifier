He would get them from his dental hygienist. \n\"When I'd go in for like a cleaning or something — she'd slip me these little bags of teeth. And they'd be in a little biohazard bag. And she'd be all, 'Don't worry, I steamed them. And then I'd put them on a dish on the coffee table,\" Theroux said on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" Thursday. \nNot surprisingly, host Jimmy Kimmel didn't seem shocked that Theroux admitted Aniston hasn't allowed the tooth collection into their house. \nProbably a wise decision, since Theroux once told GQ Magazin e house guests often thought the teeth on the coffee table were mints. Don't worry — it sounds like he stopped them before anyone actually ate a human tooth. \nSo now, Theroux admitted to Kimmel he's moved on to collecting what are called dental mannequins — which honestly look just as frightening as a dish full of human teeth. \nThis video includes Getty Images.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T15:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:13:44.247+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
