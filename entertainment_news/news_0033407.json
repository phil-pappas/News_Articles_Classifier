Comment Posted Oct. 17, 2015 at 12:21 AM LOUISVILLE Country music singer Ricky Lee found America right here in the Constitution Town. The 47-year-old Nashville recording artist played a concert here during the city’s annual Constitution Festival last month. He was so impressed by the character, spirit, patriotism and small-town charm of Louisville and its 9,147 people, that he returned Friday to play another gig and gather footage to be used in a video for his song “Looking For America.” “The whole community is going to be part of it,” said the man who has gained a cult following among military veterans he supports and raises money for during events at hospitals and clubs. Lee’s real last name is Lonsinger. He never served in the military, but the Altoona, Pennsylvania, resident said he owes veterans his life. It’s thanks to them that he can make a living doing what he loves — singing. “I’m living the American dream ... this is my way of giving back,” Lee said. On Friday afternoon, videographers shot footage in the Louisville area. They aimed their cameras at the quaint downtown. They visited Sacred Heart of Mary Catholic parish. They visited with the locked-out Steelworkers on the picket line at Allegheny Technologies. In the evening, the show continued. Lee — wearing boots, a black leather jacket and black cowboy hat — waltzed into Louisville Leopards Stadium and belted out the national anthem prior to the football game with Carrollton. Then, Lee high-tailed it back to the Eagles Club for a concert in front of a crowd of about 100 people, with all of the $10 per person cover going to his Music 4-R-Vets program. Rhonda Griffin, executive director of the Louisville Area Chamber of Commerce, was responsible for bringing Lee back to the area. She also choreographed most of the day’s activities in the city, which officially was dubbed Constitution Town by the city council in 1957. “Our new friends,” Griffin called Lee and members of his family and crew when she introduced him for the Eagles Club concert. After a handful of numbers there, it was back to the stadium, where many in the crowd still held some of the 4,000 flags handed out for free at the admission gate. After Louisville’s 40-7 pummeling of Carrollton, fans joined Lee on the turf field, to surround him in red, white and blue, as the video camera corralled more footage for the video. “U.S.A., U.SA ., U.S.A.,” they chanted on cue. The day’s worth of footage will be supplemented with whatever else is sent to his website rickyleemusic.com from Louisville-area residents and edited into a music video. Page 2 of 2 - In the song “Looking For America,” Lee laments the vanishing iconic America. The kind of place, according to the song, where “people aren’t afraid to say God’s name out loud;” where there’s “a factory where a man can feed his family;” where the people who live there “still believe that freedom isn’t free.” That’s the place he was looking for. Until he found Louisville.
