Any visit from Browne, one of the quintessential troubadours of rock’s classic era, means a concert for which the bar for songwriting it set pretty high. He’ll no doubt play some of his best-known ’70s tunes, but last year’s “Standing in the Breach” showed Browne remains committed to dovetailing the personal and the political with new material. Equally significant on this bill, however, is the opening duo: Campbell, an ace instrumentalist with the likes of Bob Dylan and Paul Simon, stepped out front with vocalist Williams on an impressive self-titled album released in June. $46.50-$99.50. 8 p.m. Wednesday. 2300 Robert Dedman Drive. texasperformingarts.org. \nTheater \n“Evita” at Zach Theatre . Experience passion and seduction in the seven-time Tony Award-winning musical “Evita,” Zach’s newest production. Revered by her people as an advocate for the poor, Eva Perón climbed meteorically from the slums of Argentina to her role as beloved first lady at the age of 27, becoming one of the most powerful women in the world. The musical tells her unforgettable true story through some of theater’s most beautiful songs, including “Don’t Cry for Me Argentina.” 7:30 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday, 2:30 p.m. Sunday through Nov. 1. $25-$80. 1510 Toomey Road. 512-476-0541, zachtheatre.org. \nArts \n“Frank Reaugh: Landscapes of Texas and the American West.” Called the “Dean of Texas Artists,” Frank Reaugh sketched from the saddle as a young man in the 1880s, riding with trail drivers during the heyday of epic cattle roundups. The vast Lone Star landscape and the Texas Longhorn cattle quickly became Reaugh’s lifelong artistic inspiration. With more than 200 artworks from the University of Texas’ Harry Ransom Center’s collection, the sweeping exhibit surveys the life and work of the distinguished landscape artist. 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday-Friday (Thursday until 7 p.m.), noon to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday through Nov. 29. Free. Harry Ransom Center, 300 W. 21st St. 512-471-8944, hrc.utexas.edu. \nComing up \nMy Morning Jacket at Austin Music Hall. “We try to create a different environment for each album, because whether you like it or not, you’re a product of your environment,” My Morning Jacket drummer Patrick Hallahan said in a recent phone interview about “The Waterfall,” the band’s seventh studio album. Recorded at a studio overlooking the coast in Northern California, the album not surprisingly sounds influenced by the natural beauty of those surroundings. It’s their first album in four years; leader Jim James made a solo album and took part in a Woody Guthrie tribute in between, and Hallahan joined the Spanish Gold trio with Austin’s Adrian Quesada. Thursday’s show opens a two-night stand at the Music Hall with the Fruit Bats. 8 p.m. $46. 208 Nueces St. musichallaustin.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T13:25:31.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
