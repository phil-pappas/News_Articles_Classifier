ABC’s “Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.” \nThings are about to get even more intense as the third season of ABC's hit superhero drama TV series \"Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\" continues this week with an episode that will see Agent Coulson and the rest of the team hunting for a rogue Inhuman who in turn is on the trail for other Inhumans. Meanwhile, Jemma recounts to Fitz her struggles while being on an alien planet. \nCiting the spoiler reports from the International Business Times , it is said that with the recent escalating issues with the Inhumans, Coulson and company will have no choice but to forge an alliance with Rosalind. The information they get from each of the parties would point out to a certain Inhuman named Lash who, aside from murdering other Inhumans, also kills humans for reasons still unknown. \nFor those who missed it, executive producer Jeff Bell explained to TVLine that the character, played by former NFL star Matt Willig, \"has a fairly strong opinion about what should happen to Inhumans.\" The EP wants the viewers to look at the hideous character as somewhat of a \"wild card,\" capable of doing something good or evil. \n\"You don't know why he is doing this — Does he have an agenda? Is he on somebody's side? So we'll be teasing that out over some episodes,\" he told the media outlet. \nThe promo photos, meanwhile, show Coulson and Rosalind's team working together. However, Hunter and May still remain to be at odds with each other. In fact, the images revealed the two are about to go into a gun fight. \nAside from the operation to take down Lash, a report from FashionNStyle.com said that fans should also expect some \"tender moments\" between Fitz and Simmons as Jemma recounts to her knight in shining armor the struggle she had to undergo on an alien planet. \nCatch \"Devils You Know\" on ABC this Tuesday, Oct. 20.
