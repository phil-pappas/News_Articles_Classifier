Now, daughter Chelsea is speaking out with a different take on events. \nChelsea was kicked out of the house two weeks before her 18th birthday, she says. \n\"Rosie knew I was planning to leave, that's why I think she kicked me out,\" Chelsea, now 18, tells the DailyMail in a new interview. \"She asked me to talk about what was going on and I didn't want to. So she asked for my phone and my computer. This was hours before she told me to leave.\" \nChelsea continues: \"I gave them to her. A few hours later, she told me to leave. I wasn't planning to go until I turned 18 on the 24th. Rosie said that I was almost 18, and she got all this crap from work, and she didn't want to have to deal with that at home too.\" \nOn August 18, O'Donnell posted a frantic notice on her social media accounts, describing what Chelsea was wearing when she was last seen, her tattoo and her black and brown terrier, Bear, a therapy dog who was with her. \"Chelsea stopped taking her medicine and is in need of medical attention. Any information please contact authorities,\" O'Donnell wrote, and listed a police number. Lawyer: Surprise facts will clear man harboring Chelsea O'Donnell \nThe description bothered Chelsea. \"People think I'm this crazy person and as I've said, I have depression and bad anxiety – but it's been something that's gotten a lot better,\" says Chelsea. \"But these were personal things and I didn't want anyone to know them about me.\" \nChelsea also told the Daily Mail was \"pretty much raised by nannies\" and claims her famous mother is short-fused and \"not genuine a lot of the time.\" — Rosie (@Rosie) September 25, 2015 \nRosie O'Donnell, an ardent tweeter, has yet to comment on the interview on any social platform and her publicist, Cindi Berger, could not confirm the veracity of Chelsea's interview. Berger called the situation with Chelsea \"heartbreaking on every level.\" \nChelsea was ultimately recovered by police at a the home of her 25-year-old boyfriend Steven Sheerer, who lives with his parents, in Barnegat, N.J. Sheerer was later arrested on the charges of child endangerment and sending Chelsea obscene images. Sheerer's attorney told the media their relationship was consensual, and that the two met on Tinder where Chelsea identified herself as 19. The charges were later dropped. \nThere was no happy reunion waiting for her at home, says Chelsea. chelsea has been found and is safe in police custody - thank u all for the help and light #missingchildren — Rosie (@Rosie) August 18, 2015 \nHer mother \"had two of my bags packed with clothes. Literally 10 minutes after the police had dropped me off at the house, I got in a car and went to a friend's house,\" says Chelsea. \"I was there for a week and then on my 18th birthday my birth mom (Deanna Micolley) picked me up and I went to her home in Wisconsin.\" \nChelsea says she is currently living with Sheerer and his family. \"I'm really happy to be here, and happier than I've been in years,\" she says. \nChelsea Belle O'Donnell is one of three kids Rosie has with ex-wife Kelli Carpenter. Chelsea is adopted but one of the three, Vivienne Rose, was born to Carpenter through artificial insemination. O'Donnell adopted her eldest child, Parker, in 1995 when he was an infant. \nO'Donnell and her second wife, Michelle Rounds, whom she married in December 2011, adopted a baby girl, Dakota, in January 2013. She and Rounds are now in the middle of a contentious divorce. \nPHOTOS | Rosie O'Donnell through the years LAS VEGAS - JUNE 08: Comedian Rosie O'Donnell performs during the kickoff of the first annual True Colors Tour at the MGM Grand Garden Arena June 8, 2007 in Las Vegas, Nevada.
