National Transportation Safety Board lead investigator Daniel Boggs said the Piper Cherokee 180 was flying from Orlando to Palm Beach County when it crashed into a home at the Mar-Mak Colony Club late Tuesday. The home was quickly engulfed in flames, and another home also was damaged, he said.\n\"We won't speculate on the cause of the accident,\" Boggs said. \"We know that will come in time.\"\nThe plane, registered to Fliers Inc., was destroyed, Boggs said. He said investigators were reviewing security video that recorded some of the flight, possibly including the crash itself. People who called 911 will be interviewed, he said.\nThus far, investigators have found no evidence that the pilot, who apparently was alone in the plane, issued a distress call.\n\"We are very fortunate in a mobile home park that it was a large (fire) and only two mobile homes were affected,\" Boggs said.\nEarlier, Domingo Galicia told WPTV-TV the plane hit his mobile home and that his 21-year-old daughter, Banny, was presumed dead. He said she was asleep in a bedroom and he called for her to escape in the moments after the crash.\n\"Banny, Banny, Banny, come here, come here,\" Domingo Galicia said he yelled before fleeing the dense smoke.\n\"I don't feel anything. I feel like I'm standing on air,\" Galicia told the station.\nClara Ingram, who lives in the moblie home park, told The Associated Press she heard the plane hit.\nâ€œIt just pounded, like an explosion,\" and then \"nothing but a big ball of fire,\" she said.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/usatoday/editorial/graphics/maps/2015/101415-Fla-plane-crash.html", "http://www.wptv.com/news/region-c-palm-beach-county/possible-plane-crash-in-suburban-lake-worth"], "published": "2015-10-14T17:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:15:05.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
