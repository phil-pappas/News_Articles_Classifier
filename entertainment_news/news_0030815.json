(Terrence McNally) Comments \nThe little girl shook her dozens of braids and held out her book to me as I sat down opposite her on an express subway. Hers was an adventure with Mickey Mouse. \nShe kept shouting and turning the book around to show me and tell me, very animatedly, what was happening. How wonderful to meet a fellow enthusiastic reader, especially since she is 3. \nI wanted to do the same and tell the rest of the straphangers about \"Girl Waits With Gun,\" yet somehow gleeful ramblings are not adorable coming from a middle-aged woman. So let me scream my jubilation here: Read this book! \nRELATED : Forgotten N.J. true-crime tale becomes returns to headlines in new book \nAmy Stewart, who wrote six non-fiction books and the bestseller \"The Drunken Botanist,\" set this in Bergen and Passaic counties of 1914 and 1915. It has that luscious feel of history improved upon. \nTold from Constance Kopp's perspective, it revolves around a wretched year in the lives of her and her two sisters. She became one of the country's first deputy sheriffs. Remember this was years before women had the right to vote. \nConstance consistently battles for justice for her sisters and a young woman wronged by the same man, Henry Kaufman, a mill owner, who nearly killed them. Those mill owners did not much care for any lives outside of their own, especially during the strikes. \nWrites Stewart, \"The mill owners used their considerable influence to have the police turn up at rallies and arrest as many people as their jails would hold. When the police were overwhelmed, the silk men hired their own private force. That's when houses started burning down.\" \nIt was supposed to be an uneventful trip; the sisters were on their way to Paterson to run errands, traveling by horse and buggy when Kaufman's car crashed into them. Many shopkeepers and pedestrians saw the accident and freed them from the carnage of the splintered buggy. Rather than apologize, offer to help and pay damages, Kaufman acted like the entitled, nasty prig that he is. A magnificent novel, based on the true story of three sisters who stand up to a powerful man who wronged them. \nThe 400 pages are an account of Constance determined to make Kaufman pay $50 in damages. Though it may seem that a fight over what today is a small amount should not take that long, every page is worthwhile. Stewart's descriptions are marvelous. \nThis is Constance, describing her older sister Norma: \"Norma had the broad Slavic face and thick nose of our father and our mother's sour disposition. Her mouth was set in a permanent frown and she looked on everyone with suspicion.\" Their father was long out of the picture and their brother, Francis, wanted to take in his three sisters, but they insisted on independence. This worked fine until bricks were thrown through their windows, shots fired at their house, strange men lurked on their property and they received threats to kidnap the youngest sister, Fleurette. \nThe authorities were no hurry to help; local cops were in the pockets of the factory owners. Then Constance met Sheriff Heath, who was to become the Kopp sisters' champion and protector: \"There was a kindness about him and a sort of sober warmth and decency, which struck me as unusual for a man in public service in New Jersey.\" The Kopp sisters easily could have been a footnote in history, were it not for Stewart's painstaking research and fine flair for building a story. She captures life in the wilds of New Jersey from a century ago during a paralyzing ice storm. \nBest of all she captures the independent, indomitable spirit of Constance. Here, toward the end, they face off in court. \n\"For just a second, Henry Kaufman and I stared each other down. I'd been running from this man for the better part of a year, but now I wanted him to see me. I wanted him to look into the face of the person he'd been tormenting. But although his eyes were forced in my direction, there was a black emptiness to them. They could have been two cold stones for all the humanity they revealed.\" I was just about at this part, wishing for more pages — a true novelty for a book critic — when I encountered my little book lover on the subway. I never opened my book on that ride, instead listening to her rave about Mickey. Now I ask that you take my rave about Stewart to heart and read it. \n\"Girl Waits with Gun\" (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 408 pp, $27) \nJacqueline Cutler can be reached at jacquelinecutler@verizon.net .
