It seems that it is Gahan who has originated many of these compositions at home in New York City, which are then brought to fruition by Machin in Northern England, although the final recordings have been a globe-trotting affair.\nShare article With a very fine gospel backing trio on all of the tracks, Gahanâ€™s baritone is in excellent shape, and at its best Angels & Ghosts sounds not unlike the lighter moments in the back catalogue of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds.
