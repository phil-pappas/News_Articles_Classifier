Photo: Rob Little \nDisciples of film \nTwo exhibitions exploring the moving image in contemporary culture open at PhotoAccess this week. From Canberra artist Louise Curham comes A Film of One's Own [Archive Fever] , a film installation and exhibition, and mid-career Finnish media artist Juhani Koivumäki brings the international premier of his video work The Apostle. \nCurham physically cuts, manipulates and treats super 8 film to fit it inside larger 16mm film to create giclee prints. Her work is designed to address the shifting nature of technology, and the sense of subjectivity and malleability that is now invested in the film-based image – \"a medium once thought to be stable and infinitely repeatable\". Koivumäki's video is a \"metaphorical media-artwork\" reflecting on Jesus as a radical figure of Christianity. He seeks to reconnect art with spirituality and mysticism using video art to recover the sense of radical spirituality in biblical stories. The Helsinki-based artist's stay in Canberra was supported by the Ainslie and Gorman Arts Centres' Visiting Artists Program. Both shows run from October 22 to November 15 at PhotoAccess Huw Davies Gallery in the Manuka Arts Centre, Griffith.\nAnton Poon's Building in Process at the Belconnen Arts Centre.

So that's what they aim to do with their latest exhibition at the Belconnen Arts Centre where climate change, war, mortality, religion, the land and the body all feature as themes challenging our view of decay and the varying landscapes around it. Landscapes of Decay spans a diverse range of mediums including painting, print, sculpture, photo media, jewellery, sound, digital, ceramics, wood, glass, textiles and dance.\nSabrina Baker's tete-a-tete at the ANCA Gallery.

Her representational paintings depict scenes of habitats immersed in Canberra's \"green skeleton\".\nAnd outside the centre is Anton Poon's Making the Connection where he was inspired by documentaries such as Mega Structures to use the metaphor of a bridge to explore the concept of cultural transition.\nComposed, arranged by Hayley Lander at the Belconnen Arts Centre. Photo: Supplied \nAll shows run from October 23 to November 15 except Making the Connection, which is in the outdoor gallery until December 13.\n \nWoolly words \nMemento Senescere ( To Grow Old) by Dianne Libke in Landscapes of Decay at the Belconnen Arts Centre. Photo: Supplied \nImagine if you could visualise all the conversations you've had over the past nine months. Emerging Canberra artist Sabrina Baker aimed to do just that through soft sculpture made from wool and rope in her first solo show Pack and Unpack at the ANCA Gallery. The CCAS Gallery manager collected data relating to her communication, to varying degrees of accuracy, and using different colours of wool to indicate different people, wrapped lengths of rope to create visual representations of this data. The end result is a map of Baker's networks with \"some colours/people reoccurring as a constant pulse while others flare up and fade away\".\nAlongside the rope works are maritime signal flags constructed from blankets and wool as a reflection of new technology and how visual languages like emojis are changing the way we communicate. Pack and Unpack is on at the ANCA Gallery, Dickson from October 21 until November 8.\n \nSteve Tomlin's Momento at the Megalo Print Studio + Gallery. Photo: Supplied \nA-mazing reflection \nIn August, Canberra artists Denise Higgins and Gary Smith launched a crowdfunding campaign to transform the CCAS Gallery into a maze made of barbed wire and mirrors . They surpassed their $7000 target raising around $10,000 plus a couple of private donations and on Friday, October 23 the end result will open to the public. Higgins says having Pozible campaign supporters investing emotionally in the project was like having a cheer squad and the duo would definitely consider crowd-funding again. \"Many artists contributed to this campaign, and that passion should be valid but only drawn on from time to time,\" she says. \"Interesting to consider campaigns that reach audiences that have not traditionally or historically supported the arts.\" Higgins says the 140-square-metre Barbed Maze is likely to create a diverse unpredictable experience. The installation is at the CCAS Gallery in the Gorman Arts Centre, Braddon until November 21.\n \nMulti-coloured birds in flight \nA new exhibition space dedicated to showing artworks by people living with disability or with lived-experience of mental illness has opened in the National Disability Insurance Agency in Braddon. It's a partnership with the Belconnen Arts Centre and the first exhibition features seven works by artists from the centre's IGNITE: Alternative Arts Academy. Staffer Ann McMahon said the space gives a voice to artists who often work outside the arts establishment in ways that challenge stigma and stereotyping. One work from Moira Nelson depicts the IGNITE members as multi-coloured birds in flight, while Jimalyn Lawless uses the mermaid as a recurring motif. For more information, or to be included in IGNITE 7 exhibitions, contact: ann.mcmahon@belconnenartscentre.com.au or phone 6173 3320. The first exhibition runs until November 13 at the NDIA, 212 Northbourne Avenue, Braddon.\n \nHard pressed \nA trio of printmakers Ilona Lasmanis, Robyn McAdam and Steve Tomlin who call themselves the Hard Pressed return to Megalo with their second exhibition since their successful first in August 2013. The title refers to the obvious printmaking process but is also said to play with the notion of time, both in the sense that we do not have all the time in the world, but more importantly, our focus on the passage of time, tradition, history and life experiences. The trio began collaborating at Megalo in 2011, evolving from the earlier Thumbprints group that had its genesis at Megalo in 2008. Hard Pressed 2 is on at Megalo Print Studio + Gallery, Kingston from October 24 to November 14.\n \nArt comes alive \nMore than 150 secondary school students will bring the national art collections at the National Gallery of Australia and the National Portrait Gallery to life with a series of museum theatre performances over the next few weeks. Come Alive 2015 begins at the NGA on Monday, October 26 with a short one-act play about the life and times of artist Lina Bryans created by the Orana Steiner School. While Daramalan College will present an interpretive piece inspired by the work of James Turrell. The free performances are on in the James O Fairfax Theatre at the NGA from  October 26 to Friday, October 30 at 1pm and  October 31 and  November 1 at 11am, 1pm and 3pm. For more information call: 6240 6701.\n \nRaise your glass \nTo celebrate the Kingston Power House's 100th birthday year the Canberra Glassworks is asking kids to design a glass work inspired by the iconic building. The competition is being launched at 10am on Saturday, October 24. Young designers in three age categories, 3-8 years, 9-13 years and 14-17 years, can choose the glass process or technique for their work.

The winning entries will be then be created by a professional artist, and the winners will be able to take home the final product. Entries close November 9.\n \nRomantic music \nLooking for a romantic way to end the weekend? The National Capital Orchestra will be performing a program of romantic music conducted by Lizzy Collier on Sunday, October 25 including Rachmaninoff's Prince Rostislav, Grieg's Peer Gynt Suite No. 1, and Dvorak's Symphony No. 9 \"NewWorld\".
