Try to take a deep breath in. Not so rewarding is it? Most of us have developed “technology posture” that is limiting our ability breath fully and deeply. Computer work, texting and ineffective use of seatbacks and headrests are the biggest culprits in developing technology posture. USE THE BACK OF THE CHAIR/HEADREST TO REST THE BACK AND HEAD - THAT’S WHAT THEY’ MEANT FOR!!\nPersons with technology posture usually have forward head (turtle’s head constantly poking out of its shell), rounded shoulders, tight chest and front neck muscles, weak and malnourished upper back and neck muscles.\nTechnology posture creates a mechanical blockade by the ribcage. This restricts the diaphragm’s ability to effectively rise and fall. The diaphragm is the major breathing muscle and like all other muscles responds best to being utilized through its full range of motion. The lungs don’t have any muscle and are almost completely passive, so when we take a breath in the ribs must maximally expand to allow the diaphragm to draw in a deep, full breath.\nDo you remember your mother constantly telling you to “sit up straight?” She was doing you a BIG favor. Because, once the body has adapted to the more comfortable “slouch” position, it becomes uncomfortable to sit up straight. As a result, muscles in the front of the neck/trunk become shortened and tense. This causes restrictions in the ease of breathing volume. Tensing these muscles to make oneself more “straight” causes tightness in the entire upper body and reduces the ease of deeper breathing.\nStretching the tight front muscles and strengthening the weak/malnourished muscles in the upper back/neck are long-term solutions to Technology Posture. However, change is hard and the neck/upper back are particularly difficult to get to cooperate.\nTry this easy posture correction exercise everyday. Then build your routine to carry this exercise into sitting and standing. Eventually add other corrective exercises that always incorporate this position.\nLie flat on your back (preferably on the floor) with a small hand-towel rolled up and placed under your neck. Turn palms completely face up, draw shoulders back toward the floor, tuck (turtle head) chin toward the towel. Holds for 10 seconds. Rest/swallow. Repeat 10x. Do twice a day, every day! When this gets easy, progress to a chair with a headrest and then eventually to standing.\nBonus: add this diaphragmatic breathing exercise in daily. Diaphragmatic breathing draws air into the lungs in a way which expands the stomach and not the chest. Breath slowly to allow the body to absorb all of the inhaled oxygen. On your back, place one hand on your chest, the other on your belly. Slowly inhale through your nose – feel your stomach expand under your hand. Slowly exhale through pursed lips to regulate the release of air. Rest and repeat 10x.\nReminder: USE THE BACK OF THE CHAIR/HEADREST TO REST THE BACK AND HEAD - THAT’S WHAT THEY WERE MEANT FOR!!\nStay Active, Stay Fit!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:31:41.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
