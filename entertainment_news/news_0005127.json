Just hours after sister Khloe Kardashian's ex-husband Lamar Odom reportedly came out of his coma, the 18-year-old reality star was on the set of boyfriend Tyga's new music video, in which she's co-starring (just like she did for his last one, remember?). \nBut while Tyga's previous video was a raunchy sort of affair (yeah, we're talking about stimulated, the song where he makes that gross reference to Kylie being underage), the 25-year-old rapper says this new offering will be more like a horror movie. Well, I totally hope that's true, because there's only so much Kylie/Tyga PDA I can handle at this point -- and from the looks of these on-set pics, in which Kylie is much more covered up than usual, I think I might just be in luck: \nHmm, whaddya think? Maybe these two are playing a pair of innocent college co-eds beings stalked by some crazy serial killer character? \nKylie looks pretty scared right there! \nAnd Tyga looks pretty scared right there!Guess we'll just have to wait and see what's got these two so freaked out. Maybe there was a ding in the vintage Rolls Royce on the set! Cause never forget, Kylie Loves Kars. \nMore from The Stir: Kylie Jenner's Sweet Message for Lamar Shows How Much the Family Loves Him (PHOTO) \nSeriously though, it's good to see a member of this family getting back to some sort of normal life in the midst of this whole Lamar nightmare. Things were on the upswing earlier in the day, too, when Tyga threw a birthday party for his 3-year-old son including such notable guests as Kylie's sister Kourtney Kardashian, her brother-in-law Kanye West, and Chris Brown (not related). Here's hoping things just keep getting better from here!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T21:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T10:58:09.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
