He groomed me, which is a technical term - 'Oh, come meet at the hotel for something to eat.' \n\"It went on in these stages. It was so disgusting. He physically lured me by saying, 'Oh, help me pick out what I'm going to wear.' There was a lot that happened between the point of entry and the bargaining. \n\"When I kept saying no to everything, there was a huge asymmetry of power and control in that room.\" \nAshley discovered years later that a number of other actresses also experienced the same thing. \nShe told Variety.com: \"Only when we were sitting around talking about it did we realise our experiences were identical. There was a mutual strengthening and fortification of our resolve. \n\"The ultimate thing when I was weaseling out of everything else was, 'Will you watch me take a shower?' And all the other women, sitting around this table with me, said, 'Oh my god--that's what he said to me too.'\" \nThe 'Insurgent' actress, who has never been offered a movie by the executive's studio, admits she \"beat [herself] up for a while\" afterwards, but later realised shame \"belongs to the person who is the aggressor.\" \nShe added: \"I was really hard on myself because I didn't get out of it by saying, 'OK motherf**ker, I'm calling the police.' \n\"It took years before I could evaluate that incident and realise that there was something incredibly wrong and illegal about it.\" ashley judd", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:19:31.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
