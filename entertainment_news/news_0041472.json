The actor, a self-described history buff, was surprised to learn of the man he would eventually portray onscreen. \n\"I thought, I know all this stuff because I read history for enjoyment,\" Hanks said on Wednesday's Live with Kelly and Michael. \"And when [they] said, 'Steven Spielberg is gonna send a story about the Cold War and spies.' I was like, 'Oh! I know all about that. There's nothing new. I know everything under the sun. I'll give Steven some notes of ideas that I think might make it better,'\" Hanks said, laughing. \n\"But it turns out there was a character, I had no idea, a guy named James Donovan, who negotiated it and he was an insurance lawyer and got drafted by the U.S. government to actually make history over six days in Berlin in 1961,\" Hanks continued. \nThe \"it\" Hanks references is the deal that freed down American U-2 spy place pilot Francis Gary Powers, who was held captive by the Soviet Union. \nHanks said it was easy working with his longtime friend, Spielberg, adding that on set he referred to him as \"el jefe,\" which means \"the boss\" in Spanish. \n\"We just agreed to say anything we want to to each other without any agenda,\" Hanks explained of the working relationship. \"Look, he's the boss. I just do what he says at the end of the day. My job is to come on and provide him with what he wants.\" \nHanks has recent experience providing someone with exactly what they want: Last month he officiated Girls star Allison Williams' wedding to her longtime boyfriend, CollegeHumor co-founder Ricky Van Veen, on a Wyoming ranch. The actor said he just followed the couple's strict instructions for their big day. \n\"I [asked], 'Do you want a lot, a little? Do you want it goofy, serious?' They said, 'We'd like it short,'\" he explained, laughing. \n\"You gotta stay out of the way. Don't screw it up. Don't say bad words. Don't trip. Because it's just about [the bride and groom] and I just stayed out of the way,\" he added of the experience. \nBridge of Spies , also starring Alan Alda, is out Friday. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
