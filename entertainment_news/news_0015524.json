To be part of the Wiley Open Access portfolio and edited by Samir Mitragotri of the University of California, Santa Barbara , the new journal will focus on ways chemical and biological engineering are driving innovations and solutions that impact clinical practice and commercial healthcare products. The journal will also highlight scientific and technical breakthroughs currently in the process of clinical and commercial translation.\nIn announcing Bioengineering & Translational Medicine, AIChE Executive Director June Wispelwey said that the new journal represents \"one of the latest and most significant examples of the strengths that chemical and biological engineers bring to the frontiers of inter-disciplinary research and its application.\" She added that she was excited that the journal attracted \"such an esteemed editor in Dr. Mitragotri, and a very, very distinguished editorial advisory board.\"\nIn discussing his plans for the journal, Mitragotri said, \"Converting engineering advances into useful clinical products is a major challenge that requires attention to issues such as safety, manufacturability, regulatory hurdles, cost, and patient acceptance, among others.\" These issues, he pointed out, are not typically considered in fundamental academic research. \"Clinical translation also often needs concurrent consideration of commercial translation, with the team and the resources required for clinical translation often assembled during commercial translation,\" he explained. He added that this interplay presents its own set of challenges.\nBioengineering & Translational Medicine welcomes manuscripts that provide new insights into translational hurdles, as well as examples of technologies that have demonstrated progress toward clinical or commercial translation. It invites contributions on topics including, but not limited to, drug delivery, drug discovery, tissue engineering, synthetic biology, gene therapy, computational modeling and bioinformatics, among others. (A more comprehensive list of topics can be found in the journal's statement of scope.) The journal will include research reports, reviews, and rapid communications. Fully open access Bioengineering & Translational Medicine will be published under CC-BY license.\nMitragotri concluded: \"To researchers who are active, or aspiring to be active, in clinical and commercial translation of biological technologies, I say 'this is your journal.' With a stellar advisory board behind us, we are poised for an exciting, quick, and successful launch. We promise a rapid and fair review and fast publication. We also welcome your suggestions and comments on ways we can make the journal better serve your needs.\"\nReadership will include chemical engineers; biological engineers, biomolecular engineers, biomedical engineers and other engineers and scientists with interests in translational medicine, biotechnology, and biochemical and biomolecular engineering; and physicians and other healthcare researchers and professionals.\nAdditional information is available at: http://www.aiche.org/biotm or by email at biotm@aiche.org .\nEDITORIAL ADVISORY BOARD:\n-- Kristi Anseth , University of Colorado Boulder\n-- Mark Davis , California Institute of Technology\n-- Michael Deem , Rice University\n-- Francis J.
