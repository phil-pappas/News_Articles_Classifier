VW chief Martin Winterkorn resigned after the scandal broke in the U.S., saying he was not aware of any wrongdoing on his part. \nEwing's still-untitled book will explore the \"more, better, faster\" ethos and how it played into the scandal. \nDiCaprio, an active environmentalist, would serve as a producer on the project.
