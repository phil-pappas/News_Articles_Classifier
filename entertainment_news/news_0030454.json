I'm over it at the moment. We're done. All I want to do is move on.\"\nAnd when he literally doesn't care who replaces him: Another instant don't-give-a-(expletive) classic from his TimeOut interview:\n\"Look, I don’t give a (bleep). Good luck to them! All I care about is that if I stop doing these things we’ve left it in a good place and people pick it up and make it better. Make it better, that’s all.\"\nWhen he refused to pout for this interviewer: \"I think you need to move on.\"\nWhen he thought the previous Bond films were garbage: He told EW exactly what he thought of the pre-Sam Mendes Bond films—in an interview conducted \"in a posh hotel suite,\" because really, is there any other place where Daniel Craig could or should physically give interviews?\n“It was going to be an easy decision for me,” says Craig, seated in a posh London hotel suite.\n“They were going to show me a script that was like other Bond movies. It was going to have the gags in it, what Pierce did, what Sean had done. They’d all be in there. And I could go, ‘Thank you very much, good luck with that.’ And that would have been wonderful. I would have been totally at peace with it.”\nWhen he called out this reporter's sexist question: DGAF Dan does NOT appreciate you calling his 49-year-old Bond Girl costar Monica Bellucci an \"older woman,\" as an unfortunate writer from the Red Bulletin (aka, Red Bull's magazine) learned.\n\"I think you mean the charms of a woman his own age,\" the 51-year-old actor responded after being asked about Bond \"succumbing to the charms of an older woman\" in Spectre .\n\"We're talking about Monica Bellucci, for heaven's sake. When someone like that wants to be a Bond girl, you just count yourself lucky!\"\nWhen he reminded us all that Bond kinda sucks. Whether you want to be with 007 or want to actually be him, Daniel Craig is here to tell you you're wrong.\nAnother classic moment from the Red Bulletin interview—Craig reminding the interview, and Bond fans everywhere, that their idol is reeeally not a great guy.\nTHE RED BULLETIN: \"What could we learn from James Bond that would help us in our day-to-day lives?\"\nDANIEL CRAIG: [Thinks for a short while.] \"Nothing.\"\nTHE RED BULLETIN: \" Speaking of women, many men admire Bond for his way with the ladies …\"\nDANIEL CRAIG: \" But let’s not forget that he’s actually a misogynist. A lot of women are drawn to him chiefly because he embodies a certain kind of danger and never sticks around for too long.\"\nAnd is actually a sad, pathetic man. Still on Team Bond? Craig had more flattering things to say about his character, one of the most beloved figures in the history of film, in an interview with Esquire :\n“He’s very (expletive) lonely. There’s a great sadness. He’s (expletive) these beautiful women but then they leave and it’s … sad. And as a man gets older it’s not a good look. It might be a nice fantasy – that’s debatable – but the reality, after a couple of months…”\nK, bye!\n© The Associated Press Daniel Craig poses for photographers during the photo call for the latest Bond film, Spectre, at Corinthia hotel in central London, Thursday, Oct. 22, 2015.
