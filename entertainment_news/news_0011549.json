Thankfully that should change pretty soon, as the aim is to roll the service out in further counties in the coming months.\nVia The Journal\nMORE: Watch: Have you seen this 3-year-old taxi driver spotted around Dublin?\nMORE: Pics: Here's why everyone's talking about this sound Irishman in Abu Dhabi\nMORE: The prizes for these new Irish Instagram awards will have everyone glued to their phones", "external_links": ["http://www.thejournal.ie/taxis-dublin-ecab-mobile-app-2381423-Oct2015/"], "published": "2015-10-12T19:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:22:40.286+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
