If men are being paid a lot more for doing the same thing, it feels s***ty.\" \nThe blonde beauty, 43, isn't upset that her close pal Downey Jr, 50, is the world's highest paid actor and earned an estimated $80 million this year, but thinks female stars deserve to receive more money. \nShe told Variety magazine: \"Look, nobody is worth the money that Robert Downey Jr. is worth. But if I told you the disparity, you would probably be surprised.\" \nEarlier this year, Paltrow, who plays Pepper Potts, Tony Stark's assistant-turned love interest in the Iron Man movies, admitted she was unsure of her future with the franchise. \nShe said: \"I'd like to do it [another film]. But they might swap me out for an 18-year-old Pepper Potts or something.\" celebrity", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:19:05.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
