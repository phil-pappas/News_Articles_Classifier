Image used with permission from Left Hand Brewing Co. Left Hand Brewing Co. (Longmont, Colorado) announced this week that Fade to Black, Vol. 1 is officially returning to shelves and taps now as the brewery's winter seasonal.\nFresh from its latest gold medal win at the 2015 Great American Beer Festival, Fade to Black is a Foreign Export Stout that has proven to be a prime example of the style and the perfect beer to usher in the winter months ahead. This brew pours as a rich, deep black body that produces flavors and aromatics of licorice, espresso beans, and molasses. To give Fade to Black its distinctive roasted, smoke character, Left Hand brewers personally hand-smoke 2550kg of malts over pimento wood from Jamaica. The process is a labor of love, but that's how you create a beer that has the awards and cult following that Fade to Black currently enjoys. For more information on this offering, here's the full brewery description:\nThat time of year when the day seems to fade away. Drifting further into the darkness with each passing day. Volume 1 – Foreign Stout – Pours black with licorice, espresso bean, molasses, and black cardamom notes that give way to a feeling of self loathing, burnt opportunities and smoked relationships. ( 3X Gold Medal Winner at the Great American Beer Festival in the Foreign Stout category.)\nFade to Black is a seasonal release that is available now in six-packs of 12 oz. bottles and on draft. Look for this one at craft beer friendly retailers in Alabama and throughout Left Hand's 35 state distribution footprint. Fade to Black truly is a must try brew that deserves a spot in the fridge of any Stout lover this winter. Be sure to grab a sixer whenever you come across it.
