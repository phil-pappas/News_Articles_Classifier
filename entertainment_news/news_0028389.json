Instead of going for help — this season is set in 1979, so there were no cellphones — Peggy drove home, with the man still stuck in her windshield. She put the car in the garage and calmly prepared dinner. \n\"I think Peggy is so overwhelmed by it that she's like, 'OK, I'm gonna go home and I'm going to think about it and then I'll decide,' \" says Dunst, who doesn't think Peggy was \"totally sure\" if the guy was alive or dead. \"I just think she knew it was bad, and if she was gonna get in trouble for it, she wouldn't be able to do all the things that she wanted to do in life.\" \nAs it turned out, the bad guy she hit — Rye Gerhardt — was not dead, which becomes apparent after Peggy's sweet but lunky husband Ed Blumquist (Jesse Plemons of \"Breaking Bad\"), comes home from his job at the Luverne, Minn. butcher shop and hears strange thumping noises in the garage. When he goes to investigate, Ed discovers the bloody, angry knife-wielding victim — and stabs him to death in what could have been argued was self-defense. \nAgain, though, instead of seeking help, the couple continue to make poor decisions. Spoiler alert, if you haven't yet watched last week's second episode: Ed burns Rye's clothes in their fireplace, and puts the body through the butcher shop's meat grinder — a gruesome scene that brings to mind the infamous wood chipper sequence in the Coen brothers' darkly-comedic 1996 movie \"Fargo,\" which inspired Hawley's series. \n\"They're just burying themselves deeper and deeper and they don't realize who this Rye Gerhardt is or who the family is. They have no idea what's coming for them,\" says a chuckling Dunst, who finds this second season \"more comedic than the first.\" \nRye is part of the Gerhardt crime family of Fargo (who are themselves being targeted by the Kansas City mafia). Will the Gerhardts' Native American tracker/enforcer get to the Blumquists before Luverne-based Minnesota State Trooper Lou Solverson (Patrick Wilson) can convince them to 'fess up? \nDunst uses the term \"mental illness\" to describe her character, but says there's a sad back story that was originally to have been glimpsed in a flashback. \n\"We actually had a scene that we didn't end up shooting, but I was at the butcher shop with my then-fiancé and he was going to Vietnam and he tells Ed, my now husband, 'Take care of her if anything happens to me,' \" says Dunst, whose character's fiancé died in Vietnam. \"So, I think she's been repressing that trauma for so long, and then all these little lies just are manifesting in a really sociopathic behavior.\" \nThat flashback would have confirmed what \"Fargo\" viewers probably sense — Ed was not the love of Peggy's life. \"But I think she loves him,\" Dunst says. \"I do think this is a weird love story in a way. Because as this season goes on, you'll see that they become closer together and bonded because of what they're going through. So, I think of them as like an uncool 'Bonnie and Clyde.' \" \nDunst, 33, moved to California in time to start sixth grade there, but spent her first 11 years in Brick Township (commonly known as Brick or Bricktown). \nAn 'idyllic childhood' \n\"I went to Ranney School [in Tinton Falls] and I grew up on the Manasquan River in Bricktown,\" Dunst says. \"My grandparents lived in Point Pleasant, and my cousins and everyone, were in Brielle … I had an idyllic childhood. My grandma lived on an inlet off the bay, and we had summers on the beach and the boardwalk. I lived on a double cul-de-sac and it was so safe for kids. My best friend lived across the street. I literally grew up how every kid wishes to grow up.\" \nDunst had a memorable recurring role on NBC's \"ER\" (1996-97), but is best known for playing Mary Jane Watson in the \"Spider-Man\" trilogy (2002-07). She started doing TV commercials at age 3, and jumped to the big screen in Woody Allen's segment of the 1989 anthology film \"New York Stories.\" Her long list of film credits include: \"Interview with the Vampire\" and \"Little Women\" (both 1994), \"Jumanji\" (1995), \"Wag the Dog\" (1997), \"Small Soldiers\" (1998), \"The Virgin Suicides\" and \"Drop Dead Gorgeous\" (both 1999), \"Bring It On\" (2000), \"Mona Lisa Smile\" (2003), \"Wimbledon\" and \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" (both 2004), \"Marie Antoinette\" (2006), \"All Good Things\" (2010), \"Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues\" (2013) and \"The Two Faces of January\" (2014). And next year, she will be seen in \"Midnight Special,\" opposite Michael Shannon and Joel Edgerton. \nBesides being impressed by the quality of \"Fargo,\" Dunst believes that today, the right series can give an actor wider exposure. \"Most actors are doing independent films and they just don't get seen,\" Dunst says. \"Adults watch television now. People don't go to the movies as much — unless it's teenagers or cartoon movies for kids. And TV's really for adults now who used to go see good movies in a theater.\" \nThe 10-episode second-season of \"Fargo\" went into pre-production at the end of January, and filmed through May, in Calgary, Alberta. \"It was cold and a little lonely up there. I'm not gonna lie,\" says Dunst. \"A lot of us were in the same apartment building, which was nice … And my brother visited me and my friends did. But it's always hard when you have to leave home for a significant amount of time. I'm someone who is more of a homebody.\" \nOn the set, there was a dialect coach to help with the Minnesota accent. \"I think once we got through the first three episodes, it's in you and you need less and less help,\" says Dunst, who had done a \"much campier version\" of that state's accent for her 1999 film \"Drop Dead Gorgeous.\" \nDunst enjoyed wearing the styles of the late 1970s and she worked closely with the show's costume designer on her character's look. \"I wanted people just to giggle a little bit at Peggy when they saw her,\" says Dunst, who also thought that \"with all the things she does, it would be more palatable to see her in little berets and things like that.\" © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T07:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:08:03.332+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
