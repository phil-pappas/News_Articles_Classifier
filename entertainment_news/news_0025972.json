He said those projects were \"Pottersville\" and \"The Divorce Party.\" \n\"Pottersville\" is also being produced by Ron Perlman's Wing and a Prayer production company. \nSimonds said Baldwin passed on \"Pottersville\" because of a scheduling conflict. \nJohnson's Film House is the production company behind \"American Dresser,\" which finished filming in the Syracuse area last month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T00:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:07:32.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
