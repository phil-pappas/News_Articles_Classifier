Today, I am in that phase of my life where I can choose the work I want and experiment with my craft.\" However, he sounded thrilled about the reception he got from the Delhi audience. \"The audience was so receptive. I could easily connect with them. My theatre journey began on a great note. It was my best trip to Delhi and I will be coming back soon to the capital for my play\" he said.\nKiran has been to Delhi several times to meet friends and relatives. He finds Chandni Chowk very fascinating. He said, \"I used to go to Chandni Chowk to have chholey bhature at a famous outlet and I would always wonder how people live so happily in such a congested place.\" Talking about Delhi winters, he said, \"I love visiting Delhi in winters. I turn vegetarian at that time because I think vegetables taste their best in winters in Delhi. I also go for walks in CP and have ice cream there and I like to have paranthe at Moolchand and sweets at Bengali Market.\" Kumar also said that he loves the greenery in Delhi, something he can't find in Mumbai.\nFor latest Theatre updates follow us on Twitter >>> @TOIEntertain\nFor the latest in Theatre news, like us on Facebook >>> TOIEntertain\nWATCH: Exclusive Kiran Kumar Interview!", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TOIEntertain", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/nNdj2KdyV-Y", "https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T19:48:07.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
