Source: News Corp Australia \nTASMANIA has a new outdoor live music venue capable of hosting the world’s biggest touring acts with the launch today of Skyfields in the state’s North-West. \nLocated in the grounds of Eagles Nest Retreat in the foothills of Mount Roland outside Sheffield, the picturesque Skyfields site can hold up to 15,000 people and is hoping to attract big-name international acts who would have otherwise left Tasmania off their tour schedule. \nSkyfields director David Sykes has spent the past 12 months working with one of Australia’s leading touring and promotions companies to develop a business model that will allow them to bring some of the planet’s leading artists – and their fans – to the state on a regular basis. \nThe new venue’s first headline show will see nine-time ARIA Award-winner Missy Higgins perform with the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra on Saturday March 19, with more acts set to be announced soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:29:52.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
