JONES ATLANTA — Months after a deadly shooting in Charleston sparked calls for the removal of Confederate symbols, Georgia leaders are still batting around proposals, including ideas related to Stone Mountain, the state’s Confederate memorial park and site of the world’s largest stone carving, which depicts three Confederate leaders.\nSome black activists have called for removing the 3-acre carving from the mountainside because they say it glorifies slavery. Confederate-commemoration groups defend the image as history, adding that few of those who fought owned slaves and neither did the two generals depicted.\nPlus, they say, the Confederacy’s president on the mural, Jefferson Davis, adopted a black son.\nThat debate had simmered quietly in the months since the shooting until two weeks ago when the state board that oversees the park announced plans to erect a bell atop the mountain as a monument to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. His “I have a Dream” speech in 1963 had included the line, “let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.”\nThat idea drew fire from two directions. King’s family and members of civil-rights groups objected because they said the association would sully King’s reputation. The Sons of Confederate Veterans objected, pointing to state law designating the park as a Confederate memorial.\n“Furthermore, the [filtered word] of a monument to anything other than the Confederate cause being placed on top of Stone Mountain because of the objections of opponents of Georgia’s Confederate heritage would be akin to the state flying a Confederate battle flag atop the King Center in Atlanta against the wishes of King supporters,” the Confederate Veterans said in a statement earlier this month.\nInstead of a bell for King, civil-rights groups want the whole carving removed.\n“We want to eradicate it. We want to blast it. We want to paint over it. Whatever it takes, that’s what we want to do,” said Charles Steele Jr., head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference that King founded.\nStatements like that have prompted plans for a rally Nov. 14 at the park by the Confederate Veterans and similar groups billed on social media as “Defend Stone Mountain.” The Southern Poverty Law Center that tracks what it calls “hate groups,” said the rally will attract leaders of the Ku Klux Klan, including some calling for violence.\nLegislators’ reaction\nGov. Nathan Deal initially offered his support for the King bell but withdrew it.\nMany state political leaders say the [filtered word] of a statute of King on the Capitol grounds that the General Assembly approved last year should settle the matter. A sculptor is being sought after the one originally commissioned was killed by a drunk driver.\nFriday, Rep. Brian Prince, D-Augusta, was at the park along with other freshmen legislators for a workshop in the shadow of the granite mountain. Visitors of all races were enjoying the park, said Prince, who happens to be black.\n“There was no one boycotting the park that I could see,” Prince said.\nPrince is content to leave the carving alone, saying history is history.\nOther legislators feel the same, such as Rep. Jeff Jones, another freshman who’s a Republican from Brunswick. Jones is unhappy with a change Deal instituted by executive order in August when he decreed that the state would no longer observe Confederate Memorial Day and Robert E. Lee’s birthday while keeping them unnamed holidays for state employees.\n“This power should rest with the people and their representatives, not the executive branch,” Jones said.\nAnd Rep. Jason Spencer, R-Woodbine, says efforts to scrub history fly in the face of realty.\n“Bringing in ‘inclusive symbols’ is a way to sanitize history and to make things politically correct,” he said. “Most people are tired of being politically correct.”\nOn the other side are legislators like House Democratic Leader Stacey Abrams of Atlanta.\nShe said a statue or monument to King, who lived a 100 years after the Civil War, doesn’t address concerns about Stone Mountain. The two issues are distinct, she said.\nThe new attention to Stone Mountain brings an opportunity she welcomes to have a discussion about using the park to recognize other aspects of a war she describes as “a complicated attempt to maintain an economic system based on slaves.”\nWhile not calling for removal of the carving, Abrams said other displays would be appropriate.\n“I very much support the idea of recognizing the broader history that is part of the Confederacy,” she said.\nWhen the legislature does discuss history, one lawmaker is often in the middle, Rep. Tommy Benton. A former history teacher, the Jefferson Republican is the sponsor of Confederate History Month and a bill to prohibit the dismantling of historic monuments or moving them to less prominent locations if they have to be relocated because of road construction. The monument bill passed out of committee during this year’s session but never came to the full House for a vote.\n“It would protect monuments to black leaders, white leaders, Hispanic leaders,” he said.\nBenton argues that Southern culture draws tourists and dismisses arguments from business groups like the Georgia Chamber of Commerce that Confederate symbols may seem inhospitable to visitors and employers from other regions of the world.\n“What do people want to see when they come to Georgia like they did for the Olympics?” he asks. “They wanted to see what they had heard about all of their life. They wanted to see Tara; they wanted to see ‘Gone with the Wind.’ I think that’s a bunch of hooey on the part of the Chamber.”\nAs officials in South Carolina bowed to concerns about flying the Confederate flag on the Capitol grounds in Columbia, pressure on Georgia officials ratcheted up to reconsider symbols in this state.\nHouse Speaker David Ralston hopes an agreement can be reached by Georgia groups on both sides without the need for legislative involvement, according to his spokesman Kaleb McMichen.\nSenate Majority Leader Bill Cowsert, when asked if he anticipates legislation in January regarding Stone Mountain or other symbols replied, “None, to my knowledge.\n“But the legislature is very unpredictable, and anything is possible,” said Cowsert, R-Athens.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/AP_207663013219.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/AP_207663013219.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-25T13:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:56:55.152+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
