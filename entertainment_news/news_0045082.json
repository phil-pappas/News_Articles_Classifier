By KARSON HOAGLAND Young witches and wizards — and even a few dinosaurs and princesses — turned out to the Savannah Children’s Museum and the Georgia Railroad Museum for the annual Frogwarts event Sunday afternoon. More than 200 groups attended, and the parking lot was full within 30 minutes of the event starting.\nFamilies in attendance took a ride on the Frogwarts Express to a magical, albeit educational, experience.\nIn past years, the Georgia Railroad Museum has had its own October event called Tricks, Treat and Trains, while the Savannah Children’s Museum has hosted Frogwarts. This year, the two joined forces and combined “the best of both worlds,” said Abby Rookstool, who works in marketing and administration for the Coastal Heritage Society.\nThat meant utilizing more of the railroad museum’s space and having buckets of candy at each of the event’s “classes.” Those classes included Defense Against the Dark Arts, which provided children in attendance with glow-in-the-dark objects to play and write with; Charms, which involved children drawing bracelet charms out of a cauldron to predict whether they loved animals, wanted to go on adventures or were very lucky; and Potions class, in which a magical professor, Savannah Children’s\nMuseum operations manager Monica Meldrum, showed children experiments using dry ice.\nThere were also classes for herbology, with a honey-tasting provided by the Savannah Bee Co.; strange reptiles, courtesy of the Georgia Reptile Society; and a wand-making class with instruction from Scribble Art Studio staff.\n“Our local partnerships with Savannah Bee and the Reptile Society just happened to work really well together for this event,” Rookstool said. “It almost designed itself, in a sense.”\nRookstool also said that the museums haven’t had any complaints about the magical theme of the event, which was inspired by some of the staff’s love for the Harry Potter series.\n“We’re focused on younger kids,” she said. “The Harry Potter theme is more for the parents — they get all the little references. But everything is kid-friendly and there’s nothing scary — we’re not doing spells or anything ‘evil.’”\nShe continued: “I mean, the scariest thing out here is J.R. (a staff member) dressed as Hagrid, and everyone loves him.”\nIn fact, the entire event was structured to be more about education than spells and witchcraft.\n“Everything in the children’s museum conforms to educational standards and guidelines,” said Liz Stratford, director of Children’s Education for the Coastal Heritage Society. “There are pieces of education throughout everything here (at Frogwarts).”", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14801634.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14801634.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14801636.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14801631.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14801633.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14801632.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14801636.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14801630.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14801633.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14801631.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14801635.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14801635.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14801630.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14801632.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-11T17:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:47:15.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
