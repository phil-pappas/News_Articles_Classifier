The former \"Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" returned to music last week with a rap on a remix of Bomba Estereo's \" Fiesta ,\" his first new song in a decade. Smith told Zane Lowe's Beats 1 radio show Monday that he's recorded about 30 new songs but is still working on finding his voice to \"fit the flavor of music that I tend to like.\" The 47-year-old rapper-actor added that he's planning his first-ever world tour as DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince for next summer, when an album would hopefully be ready.\nJim Carrey's girlfriend was married when she died, according to multiple reports. Cathriona White , 30, was found dead in her L.A. home last week of an apparent suicide and her body will be released to her husband in her home country of Ireland. She was reportedly preparing to file for divorce but the unidentified man is still listed as her next of kin. White and Carrey, 53, dated on and off for three years but were said to be on a \"breather\" when she allegedly overdosed on pills, some of which may have been prescribed for Carrey. Toxicology results are expected in 8 to 12 weeks.\n» Read more at the New York Daily News .\nMatt Damon is \"Stuck on Uranus\" in a funny spoof of \"The Martian.\" This time, the actor's astronaut character gets sent to a new planet and left behind, forced \"to explore the surface of Uranus.\" The trailer for the one-note joke sequel aired on \"Ellen\" Tuesday, featuring Ellen DeGeneres as the head of NASA and Kim Kardashian as an expert on butts space. \"Did somebody say Uranus?\" she asks.\nNew reports say Syracuse native Tom Cruise paid for his daughter's wedding , but he didn't attend because he wasn't invited.

Nicole Kidman, who adopted \"Bella\" (as she prefers to be now called) with Cruise in 1992, was in London performing in a West End play but conflicting stories suggest she also may not have been invited.
