During these years he became fascinated with the side effects of our social structure, how it affects children, and continues to affect them as they grow into adults.\n“I decided to write my observations in the form of a children’s book. I did this for two reasons. First, I believed that the information would be more interesting if written with witches, toy factories, and rhyme. Second, it would be more fun to write,” Reedy said.\n“Tales For Your Monkey’s Mind” will take you on a whimsical journey through the puzzling world of humans with hypnotic prose and fairytale fantasies. Unusual and odd, its quirky style and vibrant illustrations wrap its underlying themes in tales of wonder.\n“Though I wrote ‘Tales For Your Monkey’s Mind’ as a children’s book, its themes are universal. It is my hope that it will enliven the minds of its readers, and be used as a proactive and healthy discussion tool,” Reedy said.\nEach of the six stories in “Tales For Your Monkey’s Mind” will lead its readers through different perspectives of life and return them changed from the journey. So leave the safety of your tree and set your inner childfree. With all the wonders you will see, it’s worth the trip; you will agree.\nFor more information, visit monkeymindtales.com\nTales for Your Monkey’s Mind\nBy: Steve Michael Reedy\nISBN: 978-1504332132\nAvailable in hardcover\nAvailable on Amazon, Barnes & Noble and Balboa Press\nAbout the author\nSteve Reedy, MA, LPC, is a licensed professional counselor.
