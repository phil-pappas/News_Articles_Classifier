They had earlier defended showing such a commercially influenced production.\n“It’s a Scorsese film, not a commercial. The casino paid for the film, but it’s not in the film at all,” Venice director Alberto Barbera told The Hollywood Reporter earlier this year.\nUS media estimated the film cost $70 million to produce with each actor paid around $13 million to appear, but this has been denied by Melco Crown.\nBIFF programmer Pak Dosin had earlier told AFP his festival had first been approached by the film’s Hong Kong-based representative in May, asking if he might be interested in screening it.\nHe insisted the film had been chosen on its merits and that he “liked it very much.”\nThe last Scorsese film to screen at BIFF was “Taxi Driver”, which formed part of a retrospective programme in 2009.\nScorsese and De Niro are long time collaborators and have had a number of hits together including 1995 drama “Casino”. The director also regularly works with DiCaprio.\nTongues first started wagging about the nature of the film after a brief trailer — which revealed De Niro and DiCaprio arriving at a casino, scripts in hand and apparently ready to audition for the same role in a Scorsese production — found its way on the YouTube in January but was soon pulled from the site.\nThe Busan festival continues until October 10.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:50:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
