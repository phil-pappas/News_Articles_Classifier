Kilometre seeks outstanding consulting fees in an aggregate sum of US$25.6 million (or alternatively, damages), certain declaratory relief, interest, costs and further and/or other relief as the court deems fit. On February 10, 2015 , Kilometre amended its statement of claim to seek outstanding consulting fees in an aggregate sum of US$44.9 million (or alternatively, damages), certain declaratory relief, interest, costs and further and/or other relief as the court deems fit. On February 17, 2015 , Kilometre applied for a summary judgment for consulting fees of US$39,229,944.32 , interest and/or other relief as the court deems fit. In April 2015 , Kilometre issued an invoice to the Company asserting an increased entitlement to US$45.8 million ; however, this amount is yet to be reflected in any further amendment to the statement of claim. On July 8, 2015 , a Hong Kong High Court Judge dismissed Kilometre's summary judgment application and granted the Company unconditional leave to defend Kilometre's claim. The effect of the dismissal of the summary judgment application, subject to any appeal, is that Kilometre's claim will now follow the usual litigation procedure. It can typically take 18 - 24 months to proceed to trial in Hong Kong . There is, at present, no scheduled hearing or further judgment expected from the Hong Kong Courts.\nIn addition, Kilometre served a statutory demand on the Company in the Cayman Islands on May 21, 2015 requesting the Company to pay a purported debt of US$39,229,944.32 within 21 days. On June 9, 2015 , the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands (the \"Grand Court\") granted an injunction restraining Kilometre from representing a winding-up petition against the Company based upon the statutory demand or any other statutory demand in relation to the same claim. On the same day, the Company issued an originating summons from the Grand Court seeking to set aside the statutory demand. On July 22, 2015 , following the dismissal of the Hong Kong summary judgment application , Kilometre gave an undertaking to the Grand Court not to present a winding-up petition against the Company on the basis of the statutory demand pending the resolution of the Hong Kong proceedings. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against all legal actions taken by Kilometre on the merits. If the Merger is completed prior to the resolutions of the disputes between the Company and Kilometre, then pursuant to the Merger Agreement and the effects of the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will become party to such unresolved disputes and succeed to and assume all of the Company's rights and obligations with respect thereto.\nOn August 18, 2015 , the Shanghai No.1 Intermediate People's Court (the \"Court\") heard a case between Wuhan Shengwei Network Technology Co., Ltd. (\"Shengwei\"), as plaintiff, and Lansha Information Technology ( Shanghai ) Co., Ltd. (\"Lansha\"), a subsidiary of Shanda Games , as defendant with counterclaims, and Shanghai Shengfutong Electronic Business Co., Ltd. (\"Shengfutong\"), a company affiliated with Shanda Interactive Entertainment Limited, a former shareholder of the Company, arising out of a dispute in connection with an agreement regarding Lansha's licensing to Shengwei certain enforcement rights related to the game Mir 2. Based on the original complaint filed by Shengwei dated May 22, 2015 , Shengwei is seeking from Lansha (1) a refund of the license fees of RMB60 million previously paid to Lansha; (2) compensation for the loss of anticipated interest of RMB35,499,600 from Lansha; and (3) court fees. Shengwei also seeks to hold Shengfutong jointly and severally liable for such damages. Lansha filed counterclaims against Shengwei, and seeks to recover from Shengwei (1) damage in the amount of RMB30 million from Shengwei under the relevant agreement; (2) interests on the delayed payment of RMB30 million ; and (3) court fees. The Court has not rendered any judgment. The Company intends to vigorously defend this case on its merits.\nCurrency Convenience Translation\nThe United States dollar (\"US$\") amounts disclosed in this press release are presented solely for the convenience of the reader.

The Company makes no representation that the Renminbi or U.S. dollar amounts referred to in this release could have been, or could be, converted at such rate or at all. The percentages stated are calculated based on the RMB amounts.\nNote to the Financial Information\nThe unaudited financial information disclosed above is preliminary and subject to adjustments. Adjustments to these preliminary financial statements may be identified when audit work is performed for the year-end audit, which could result in significant differences from this preliminary unaudited financial information.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this earnings release contains non-GAAP financial numbers including non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders and non-GAAP earnings per share data.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company exclude share-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and the related income tax effects. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Shanda Games believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with Shanda Games' results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate the Company's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.\nShanda Games believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. Shanda Games' management also believes that the non-GAAP financial measures are appropriate for period to period comparisons in the Company's budget, planning and evaluation processes. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that Shanda Games may exclude in reviewing its financial results.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements.
