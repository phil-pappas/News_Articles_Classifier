The show is slated for fall 2016 and additional casting will be announced later. \nLike Hamlet and Macbeth, Othello is a Shakespearean protagonist driven mad by suspicion and fear. In the play, Othello's trusted lieutenant spins a web to make him doubt his wife's fidelity. \nCraig plays James Bond in \"Spectre\" out next month and Oyelowo is next slated to co-star with Zoe Saldana in \"Nina\" about singer Nina Simone. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:51:41.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
