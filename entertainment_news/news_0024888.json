Photograph by: Barry Roden , Handout \nLISTEN TO THE PODCAST: \n=== \nRenowned Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield is releasing his new album Space Sessions: Songs From A Tin Can on Oct. 9, collecting original material he recorded while sojourning on the International Space Station. The songs were re-dubbed on Earth with the help of a host of veteran Canadian session musicians. \nAll profits from the album will be donated to music education in Canada. \nHere are five things we learned from our interview with Hadfield. \n1. Singing in space is hard. \n“Your space voice is changed,” Hadfield explains. “Because of the fluid shift in your body and the lack of gravity, your sinuses never drain and your tongue and vocal cords are always just a little bit swollen. It’s not an easy place to sing. The whole point of (the album) is: This is how I felt at the time. This is what it was truly like.” \n2. When looking back at the Earth from space, everyone talks in whispers. \n“There’s a big bulging window that sticks down toward the Earth, and you go in there deliberately because you have to steal time — either you’re ahead of the schedule or you’re supposed to be asleep. You get into the bulging window and if somebody is there with you, you always talk in whispers because there’s this feeling of awe and reverence and privilege to see the world that way. You can’t help it. It’s like going into one of the big cathedrals of the world and you naturally feel that way.” \n3. Hadfield learned to play guitar as Neil Armstrong walked on the moon. \n“My brother and I bought a guitar at an auction. I was about nine or 10 — about the same time that I decided to be an astronaut, actually. They walked on the moon the summer I turned 10. The two (events) were about the same time.” \n4. David Bowie sent Hadfield a note to congratulate him on the new album. \n“He loved the version (of Space Oddity) that I did and the way it worked out. His label people gave us permission to put the song up for free on YouTube for a year, but then we lost track of it and we lost permission and we took it down. But they were very gracious about it. Now it’s up for two years, but we also decided it would just make sense to put it as a bonus track on the album.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:42:40.577+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
