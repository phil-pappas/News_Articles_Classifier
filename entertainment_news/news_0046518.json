Couple that with the undoubtedly intense training regime he went through beforehand and we're guessing he's not a happy bunny. At all.\nWhen quizzed about the possibility of making another Bond movie, Craig was more than a little final on his thoughts. \"I’d rather break this glass and slash my wrists... I’m over it at the moment. We’re done. All I want to do is move on.\"\nThat's understandable, in fairness. He's already got three Bond movies under his belt with Spectre on the way, that makes four. According to previous statements he made, he's under contract for one more.\nThis isn't the first time Craig has spoken up about his distaste for the whole thing, stating previously that he's really doesn't appreciate the attention that being Bond brings.\nCraig went on, saying that if he did another one, it \"would only be for the money\" and that he doesn't \"want to think about it. I don’t know what the next step is. I’ve no idea.\"\nWe forget that Craig was trained in theatre acting and had a lot of serious, dramatic roles before he was in Bond. Road To Perdition, Munich, Layer Cake are just a few, not to mention several Broadway plays he's done with his wife, Rachel Weisz.\nIt's easy to think that being Bond is lots of fun, cool cars, amazing suits and everything else - but very obviously, the novelty's run out for him.\nVia Yahoo!
