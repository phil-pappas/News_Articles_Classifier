October 24, 2015 Raisa SN Charles Entertainment No comments \nNicoya Henry is the lone Antiguan and Barbudan among 13 models from the region who are competing for the title of the Caribbean’s Next Top Model. \nCycle two of CaribeNTM premiered on Monday, October 19 on Flow TV. The show, which is the regional version of Tyra Banks’ wildly successful America’s Next Top Model brand, will air for 11 episodes this season. \nThe field of 13 girls will face various fashion-themed challenges, drastic makeovers, and go sees as the judges whittle away at the bunch until only one is left. \nReturning for a second season as judges are Trinidadian model and former Miss Universe winner Wendy Fitzwilliams, photographer Pedro Virgil and Caribbean fashion icon, Richard Young. \nTwenty-two-year-old Henry, a past student of the Antigua Girls’ High School, is a model and fashion designer. Aside from modelling for several local fashion houses including aJeante, RAJ Collections and Henre Designs, she has represented the country on runways in St Lucia and Trinidad, and has also been photographed for She Caribbean Magazine. \nHenry is signed to local modelling agency MODEL, which is headed by Vanda Neale Gardner. \nThe winner of CNTM Cycle One, Treveen Stewart from the Cayman Islands, earned a $50,000 spokesperson contract with B Mobile, a modeling contract with Factor Women, and a guest appearance on the cover of Caribbean Belle magazine along with an accompanying spread. \nTune in to channel 100 on Flow TV every Monday at 9 pm to support Nicoya in her bid to become the Caribbean’s Next Top Model.
