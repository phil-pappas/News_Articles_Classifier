Kulwin said Solomon had cooperated fully with federal authorities since the beginning of the investigation, including turning over emails and other documents before they were subpoenaed.\nAn indictment returned last week accused Solomon and Vranas of arranging to pay Byrd-Bennett as much as $2.3 million in kickbacks and other perks in exchange for her using her influence to award more than $23 million in no-bid contracts to SUPES, where she had previously worked as a consultant.\nIn a December 2012 email, Solomon, who also ran a search firm that helped the Emanuel administration select Byrd-Bennett as chief of the schools, assured her that trust accounts had been set up in the names of two of her young relatives, each funded with $147,000, federal prosecutors alleged. The cash would be hers once she stepped down from her public post and rejoined his firm.\nApology not accepted, Barbara Byrd-Bennett Heidi Stevens Dear Barbara Byrd-Bennett,\nOn behalf of my Chicago public school-attending kids: Apology not accepted.\n\"I am terribly sorry, and I apologize to them,\" you said on your way out of Dirksen U.S. Courthouse on Tuesday. \"They deserve much more, much more than I gave to them.\"\nNot only is that (under)statement...\nDear Barbara Byrd-Bennett,\nOn behalf of my Chicago public school-attending kids: Apology not accepted.\n\"I am terribly sorry, and I apologize to them,\" you said on your way out of Dirksen U.S. Courthouse on Tuesday. \"They deserve much more, much more than I gave to them.\"\nNot only is that (under)statement...\n(Heidi Stevens) But before that could happen, the no-bid contracts had drawn the interest of investigators.\nBoth individual defendants as well as the two corporations face multiple counts of wire and mail fraud. Solomon and Vranas also face charges of bribery of a government official and conspiracy to defraud the U.S.\nSolomon, 47, left the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse without comment after his brief court appearance Wednesday before U.S. District Judge Edmond Chang.\nSpeaking to reporters in the courthouse lobby, Solomon's attorneys said his relationship with CPS and education officials in the Emanuel administration began before Byrd-Bennett ever joined CPS in April 2012.\nThe Tribune has previously reported that Solomon has maintained ties with some of the mayor's top education advisers dating from the earliest days of the administration. In June, the Tribune reported on emails obtained from City Hall that showed how SUPES had played up its clout as it was pitching its principal training program to Emanuel's then-top education adviser.\nEx-CPS chief Barbara Byrd-Bennett pleads guilty, tearfully apologizes to students Jason Meisner and Juan Perez Jr. As she took over as chief of the Chicago Public Schools three years ago, Barbara Byrd-Bennett was touted as an experienced administrator who was going to help the Emanuel administration turn around a system beset by a recent teacher's strike, huge budget deficits and pending school closings.\nOn...\nAs she took over as chief of the Chicago Public Schools three years ago, Barbara Byrd-Bennett was touted as an experienced administrator who was going to help the Emanuel administration turn around a system beset by a recent teacher's strike, huge budget deficits and pending school closings.\nOn...\n(Jason Meisner and Juan Perez Jr.) About a month later, the mayor's hand-picked school board approved unanimously and with no public discussion the initial phase of what later grew to a $20.5 million contract with SUPES to train principals and other school officials.\njmeisner@tribpub.com\njjperez@tribpub.com\nTwitter @jmetr22b\nTwitter @PerezJr\nCopyright Â© 2015, Chicago Tribune Trials and Arbitration Barbara Byrd-Bennett Chicago Public Schools", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561e8159/turbine/ct-barbara-byrd-bennett-apology-cps-balancing-20151014", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561d1ac5/turbine/ct-barbara-byrd-bennett-plea-met-1013-20151012", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561ebcb1/turbine/ct-chicago-public-schools-kickbacks-arraignment-20151014"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:03:51.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
