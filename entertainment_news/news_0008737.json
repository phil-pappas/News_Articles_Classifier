When asked how they would jump-start business development in areas such as Waters Avenue and Broughton Street, Bell said it would take public-private collaboration, infrastructure improvements and public engagement.\nWilder-Bryan said the council needs to support small businesses and give them the tools and equipment they need.\nQuestions regarding the impact of increased property values along Broughton Street were then fielded by the alderman at-large post 2 candidates, Alicia Blakely, Travis Coles, Brian Foster, Joseph Steffen Jr., G. Lind Taylor and Clinton Young.\nMany of the candidates took the time to criticize the Chatham County Board of Assessors’ office for changing the method of appraising some commercial property values before sharp property value increases — some by more than 200 percent — for some businesses along Broughton.\nYoung said the new assessment method needed to be reconsidered by the assessors’ board, while Foster said there should be caps on how much values can be increased in one year, and Coles said he would reach out to the Chatham County Commission to put pressure on the assessors office.\nTaylor said the increases would price the businesses out of the market and called for rolling the tax rates back to 2008 levels. Agreeing the appraisal change was wrong, Steffen also expressed the need to protect business diversity and took issue with developments along Broughton that “homogenize” the street.\n“I don’t support something that is going to make Broughton Street look like Disneyland,” he said.\nBlakely said the at-large position is not just for downtown, but all of Savannah and she would bring the businesses together to find out from the assessors office what is going on.\nMayor Edna Jackson and her challengers — Eddie DeLoach, Murray Silver Jr. and Louis Wilson — were generally in agreement that government did not have the ability to control private business by dictating wages, prices and hours.\nThe city can encourage developers to pay a living wage and hire locally, however, Jackson said.\n“We get those who are benefitting on tax credits to sign off on that,” she said.\nWilson agreed wages can be included in the negotiation process but said it’s illegal to force someone to pay a certain wage. Instead, he said, some of the larger vacant buildings could be converted into flea markets to provide jobs for residents of economically struggling communities.\nSilver said the mayor shouldn’t be telling businesses what to do when it comes to wages, but they can sit down with the owners who need council approval for a development and try to work out a deal for higher wages.\nDeLoach said the city has no business in controlling wages.\n“The fact of it is, when government gets into anything, everything goes wrong,” he said.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-14T18:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:04:13.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
