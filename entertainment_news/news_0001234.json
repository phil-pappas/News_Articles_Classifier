But the game-changing drama came at the very end, when Petra ordered up a turkey baster and inseminated herself with Rafael's sperm. Petra, Petra, Petra. What on earth were you thinking ? Cosmopolitan.com spoke to Yael Grobglas, who plays ​the villain you can't help but root for, about what type of mother Petra will be if the insemination takes and why she can't let Rafael go — even though he's not very nice to her these days.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below I can't believe Petra went through with it! Were you expecting that?\nI was hoping for it. I didn't know for sure, until I got the script for the first episode, but that is exactly what I hoped would happen. I have a feeling, if she does get pregnant, she might end up being this lioness of a protective mother. She could be terrible at it, which I think most people would expect, because she hasn't had a great fondness for children so far. But she might be great at it and surprise everyone, and that would be fantastic. I am very curious to see what Petra will be like as a mom, so I am hoping it all works out.\nMore From Cosmopolitan She doesn't have a very good role model in her mother. Magda is terrible.\nWell, the one good thing about Magda is that she is always looking out for Petra. She does have Petra's back. It was just the two of them for a very long time and they had to befriend each other. The one thing that I do wish for Petra is maybe Petra could have a few more friends. It has only been her and her mother, or a string of unsuccessful relationships, so she has basically had nobody. So I wish she would have some friends, maybe, in the next season.\nI wonder if that's part of why she is still clinging to Rafael. Because it's not like he's particularly good to her anymore.\nNo, he definitely fell out of love with her. I do think their relationship started from a place of love. I mean, she definitely loves Rafael. Beyond the money and everything. I think deep down, it was the one very successful, happy relationship she ever had. For a while, until he got sick and their relationship fell apart.\nYou see that they were happy in the flashbacks, finding out the sex of their baby, which had me pretty choked up.\nAw, thank you. They were happy. And I think for Petra, it is not easy to open up, and Rafael was the one person she was able to let her guard down with. That is something she clings to, and it is hard for her to believe that it all just fell apart. And that he could let go of her so fast.\nIn those flashback scenes, she seems happy to be having a child. But then we see when her making the pros and cons list about whether she should inseminate herself, \"motherhood\" is on the cons list. So I am a little confused. Does she want to be a mother, or not?\nI think everything is so up in the air at the moment that she doesn't know if it would keep them together or if she would have to raise a child by herself. In the flashbacks, when she was in a relationship with Rafael, it was all kind of ideal. She was in this loving relationship and everything seemed like it would be a very bright future, and so she was happy about it. But she had a miscarriage and that was really a rough thing to go through. And potentially going through that again ... I think she is scared.\nThere's another sad moment in the first episode, where you see her walk into Mateo's nursery to reclaim the sperm.\nI love that.\nAs the viewer, you're rooting for her to grab it and go — and the narrator says the same thing: \"Get out of there, Petra!\" And then he's like, \"Wait a second. Why am I rooting for her?\" Which I think is how we all feel. Why are we rooting for her?\nThat is such an exact definition of Petra. She is doing these terrible things, but thanks to our incredible writers and Jennie Urman, the head of them, it is all justified. Even if she's not doing what you would personally choose to do — and she goes to extreme measures, that's for sure — there is always a reason for it. From day one, Jennie told me when we sat down when I was cast that Petra is the hero of her own story. She is not just your classic villain. She is fighting for what she thinks is right and to have the life that she wants to lead.\nAnd she had a really hard upbringing. Jane had a hard upbringing too, like she had to navigate a lot of emotions about not knowing her father. But she had such love around her all the time — and Petra didn't. So for me, that makes me feel for her.\nShe had it rough. Which I think is why Jane and Petra can potentially get along in the future and find something in common. I would love to see that happen. I didn't have enough of them last season.\nThis isn't obviously your first role, but it's your biggest role to date on a huge hit show. Now that you're swept up in it, is there anything that's surprised you about being on such a successful TV show or about Hollywood?\nWell, honestly, I'd love to say I live this amazing Hollywood lifestyle, but actually I'm at home with my same friends and cooking. I crochet, I do watercolor. I think what surprised me the most is that that isn't the lifestyle everyone necessarily lives.\nDo you crochet while you're waiting around on set?\nActually, I learned that for the show!\nReally? Was there a scene where you crocheted?\nThere was a flashback early on in the first season to when Petra was pregnant at the beach with Rafael and she's making him a little baby hat.\nOh yeah, duh!\nSomebody taught me to crochet just for the scene so I knew what I was doing, so from the moment they handed me the hook and the yarn, I couldn't put it down! I got obsessed and I've been doing it ever since. So everybody's gotten a crocheted baby gift and crocheted scarves, and crocheting has been a thing ever since.\nYou mentioned that you would want for Petra to have more friends this season and now more of a relationship with Jane. Is there anything else you hope for her?\nI am always torn, because on one hand, I'm playing Petra and I have great affection for Petra and I love her, so I want to see her happy, as if she's my friend. I want her to find love, I want to see her settled and relaxed. On the other hand, because I'm an actor playing Petra, I want her to keep getting into crazy situations which can escalate and get even crazier as the season goes by.\n​Follow Patti on Twitter .", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PattiGreco"], "published": "2015-10-13T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T15:19:45.519+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
