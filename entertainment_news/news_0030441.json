Johnny Depp is on board to star and produce, with Bret McKenzie — one-half of Flight of the Conchords — writing the screenplay. According to THR, the film is “in early negotiations to be acquired by Fox.” \nTHR notes that Wright will next start work on “Baby Driver,” the first film he’s set to direct since 2013’s “The World’s End.” This marks McKenzie’s return to film after writing songs for 2011’s “The Muppets” (for which he won an Academy Award) and 2014’s “Muppets Most Wanted.” \nThe “Fortunately, the Milk” novel is described as a “story of time travel and breakfast cereal,” and features illustrations by comics artist Skottie Young. The book was released in Sept. 2013, received widely positive reviews and placed on the New York Times Children’s Middle Grade Best Sellers list. \nOne of the most celebrated writers in both prose and comics, Gaiman’s work has been adapted to film multiple times in the past, including “Stardust” and “Coraline.” A film based on the seminal “Sandman” series, which he wrote and was illustrated by multiple artists, is currently in development at Warner Bros.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:09:24.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
