Courtesy Universal. news.com.au News Times up! Back to the Future Day is here. Source: Supplied \nBACK to the Future has become one of the world’s most watched and iconic films since its release in 1985. \nThe following sequels which completed the Back to the Future trilogy in 1989 and 1990 inspired a whole generation of aspiring time travellers. \nBut it was Back to the Future II that makes today, October 21, 2015, a special day more than 25 years after the film’s release. October 21, 2015 ... The future back then, now our present. Source: Supplied \nFor it was October 21, 2015, that Doc and Marty travelled to in the future in a bid to stop Marty’s son from going to jail. \nWe saw fingerprint technology, hoverboards, holograms and a drought-breaking World Series win for the Chicago Cubs. \nAlmost all of those predictions from the film are realities today (except for the Cubbies win but that dream may yet prove true in the coming weeks). \nAnd so, in honour of Back to the Future Day, October 21, 2015, The Daily Telegraph gives you -in no particular order — our top 10 moments from the film franchise. “When this baby hits 88mph, you’re gonna see some serious sh*t” Back to the Future \nA truly unforgettable moment from the first film; Marty has met up with the Doc and Einstein at Twin Pines Mall and is asked to film as the Doc straps the dog into the DeLorean and announces he is set to become the world’s first time traveller. Operating the car with a remote controller, Emmett Brown does indeed send his pooch into the future. Cue the Libyans, the doc getting shot and Marty becoming the first human time traveller. “Roads where we’re going we don’t need roads” Back to the Future \nThe famous line in the opening sequence of the second film after the Doc picks Marty and Jennifer up and insists they join him in the future to resolve a serious matter which involves their children. Since they last saw one another, the DeLorean has become a flying machine and they take to the skies and travel to October 21, 2015. Where cars fly … obviously. Johnny B Goode Back to the Future \nSuch a great scene they use it in the first and second film. Marty, who’s stuck in the 1950s, takes to the stage at his parent Enchantment Under the Sea Dance after the bass player injures his hand. Having assisted the band with their ballad “Earth Angel” he kicks in with some Rock n’ Roll to the tune of Johnny B Goode. “I guess you guys aren’t ready for that yet … But you’re kids are gonna love it” he promises as the crowd glare at him afterwards. The punch at the prom Back to the Future \nThe stand up, fist pump, “he bloody did it” moment of the first (and also second) film. In a bid to ensure his parents get their romance back on track Marty — aka Calvin Klein — sets up a situation in the carpark for his father to punch him in the stomach for being inappropriate with Lorraine (Marty’s mum who’s got the hots for her son from the future). Only problem is, Biff has replaced Marty in the car. Not to see a lady thrown to the floor or taken advantage of, George McFly grows a pair and wallops Biff square on the chin, knocking him out cold. Marty jumps off casino roof Back to the Future \nThe second film has taken us to a parallel 80s where Biff rules the town and is a casino-running, George McFly murdering billionaire (thanks to the Almanac). Mary confronts him about the betting tips book and is subsequently chased to the roof of the casino by his stepfather. It’s a choice between jumping off the skyscraper or being shot “by the same gun that killed his old man”. Marty jumps, Biff thinks he’s won, but then, Marty flies up, standing on the bonnet of the DeLorean (being driven by the Doc) the door opens and thwacks Biff in the face, knocking him out! Hurray! Great Scott (take your pick) Back to the Future \nThe Doc’s line throughout the three films. Enjoy the montage. The Train in No 3 \nThe scene with Marty, the Doc and Clara (the annoying woman he’s fallen in love with), it’s epic. They have to hijack the locomotive to ensure they can get the DeLorean up to speed in order to send Marty back to the 80s. The hover board comes out, there’s near misses and people literally hanging on by their pantyhose, all making for an excellent climax to the trilogy. Hover board chase Back to the Future \nOne of the best scenes from the second film, Marty takes a pink hover board from a small child in order to escape Griff and his clan. But no! “McFly you bojo, hoverboards don’t work on water … unless you’ve got power”. Griff tells the gang to hook on and they go after their target. What to do when a big scary dude is coming at you with a baseball bat? Jump in the water and send them crashing through the window of the town hall … of course. Clock lightning strike Back to the Future \nMarty’s been sent back to November 1955, you know a week before the famous lighting strike hits the clock tower. But he’s got no plutonium! How will he ever get back? He tracks the Doc of the 50s down — explains the situation and they set it up for the clock tower to have a wires linking up to the street lights which thanks to a pole coming out the back of the time machine will generate enough power to transport Marty back to the 80s. It works! Manure I hate manure \nAgain take your pick of any of the three films, it always goes the same way. Bad guy, manure, mouthful of poo.
