With Suicidal Tendencies, Beartooth \nFour out of five stars \nMaggots by the thousands infested MTS Centre on Wednesday. \nNo, there wasn’t a major outbreak of concession-stand contamination. These maggots were hordes of Slipknot fans who swarmed the arena for the masked monsters’ latest local appearance. And no, I’m not insulting the audience: Maggots is a term of endearment coined by the Iowa thrashers and proudly adopted by the faithful. So it’s all good. \nAnd indeed it was good. Good and loud. Good and heavy. Good and crazy. Good like a Slipknot show should be. On just the second date of their fall tour, the metal extremists whipped about 6,500 black T-shirted fans into a moshing frenzy while simultaneously pummelling them into sweaty, aching submission. \nFollowing suitably energizing opening sets from thrash-punk vets Suicidal Tendencies and Ohio metalcore bruins Beartooth, Slipknot launched their full-frontal assault by appearing from behind a giant red curtain to deliver the one-two punch of Sarcastrophe and Heretic Anthem (at least, I think that’s what they played; Taylor’s vocals were all but obliterated by the band’s bottom-heavy wall of chest-rattling thunder). That kicked off a 90-minute-plus onslaught that covered the waterfront from their jawdropping 1999 self-titled debut to last year’s griefstricken .5: The Gray Chapter — with everything delivered at maximum volume, whiplash speed and homicidal intensity. \nBut this wasn’t just some vulgar display of power. The ’knot also put on one helluva show. Their stage was a Satanic funhouse of tiers and ramps presided over by a giant horned goat, with pulverizing drummer Jay Weinberg, keyboardist Craig Jones and lunatic turntablist Sid Wilson at the back, while hulking guitarists Jim Root and Mick Thomson, new bassist Alessandro Venturella and human-bowtorch frontman Corey Taylor prowled down front. Flanking them were percussionists Shawn Crahan and Chris Fehn, flailing away maniacally on custom tom-tom batteries — when they weren’t riding or hanging from them as they rose and whirled over the stage. With all that mayhem and fury on display, Slipknot barely needed more production. But they had it in spades anyway, in the form of a retina-searing light show and nearly enough pyro to singe the eyebrows of fans mashed against the barricade. \nSpeaking of those kids: They enthusiastically held up their end of the evil bargain by transforming the general-admission arena floor into a roiling sea of thrashing, moshing, crowdsurfing bodies. Despite all the testosterone flowing through the crowd, though, I spotted no actual fights or malicious violence. \nHey, even maggots can play nice.
