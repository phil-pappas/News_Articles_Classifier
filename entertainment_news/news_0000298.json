So far, their fashion credits include creating a candy-themed dress for Katy Perry, interning for designer Betsey Johnson and being featured in Teen Vogue.\nOh, and the Buitendorp sisters also shared the scoop on that recent clip from E!'s \"The Soup\" of Claire's super-cute on-air meltdown. Suffice it to say there was plenty of stress involved in last week's \"Twinning\" challenge, which gave one twin a small electric shock when the other twin fell off a slippery obstacle course.\nTheir father used to be a stage manager for famous musicians. Claire: \"When we were little, we'd go and hang out at rock concerts and sit with our big (protective headphones) on, down by the sound stage. We were oblivious to what was going on, but it was cool nonetheless.\" Shawn: \"My father used to be the production manager for Ted Nugent for a very long time. I remember hanging out with his son Rocco. We were fighting over Pog, a very popular game (with collectible discs). I think it was 'You have more' or 'You have the pretty one; I want the pretty one.' \"\nHow they got interested in fashion. Claire: \"It mainly started in high school when we were those little rebellious children who like to dye their hair different colors and wear skinny jeans. Also, we lived with our fraternal grandmother for seven years when we were little, and she was incredibly fashionable. When Jacobson's (department store) was still around, she had personal shoppers come to our home and show what was new and up and coming. She was one of those ladies who had all the shoe boxes with Polaroids on the front. I think that through immersion, when it came to going to college, we weren't sure what we wanted to do, but we knew we loved clothing in general. That was such a passion, why not try making it?\"\nWhat they learned from their mentor Betsey Johnson. Shawn: \"The paramount thing we learned is to always be yourself. Betsey is never concerned about what is on trend, what is going to be appearing in the stores next season. She creates for herself and what she thinks her customers will like. If you can just focus your interest and your design aesthetic on what you like and your fans like, you're golden.\"\nThe secret to their success on \"Twinning.\" Claire: I think the secret for us is we came in with a very clear idea of what we wanted to get out of the competition. I don't want to say we weren't there to make friends because, of course, we we did make friends along the way. But we were there to win the competition, to do well and to ultimately win the money. We took a very strategic approach.\"\n\"The Soup\" clip where Joel McHale made fun of Claire's weepy reaction after the \"Twinning\" obstacle course/electric shock challenge when she learned she'd be moving back into Shawn's house. Claire: \"I was very pleased that they were so interested in 'Twinning' that they wanted to show a clip. While it was not necessarily my finest hour, I didn't say anything stupid and was just generally upset. In that challenge, I felt that I was inflicting so much pain on my sister that it really hurt.\" Shawn: \"I think it was heartwarming that you felt so close to me, or so emotionally connected, that you would cry on camera.\" Claire: \"Cry a lot.\"\nTheir plans for the immediate future: Shawn: \"The next steps that we are pursuing is we're continuing with the VH1 family We're very interested in hosting the second season of 'Twinning,' if that comes to pass. As active participants, we know exactly what the experience is like. Additionally, we're in the works of creating our own reality TV show, and we're working on our first fashion show right now that we plan to debut at New York Fashion Week in February.\"\nHow they handle their busy schedule: Claire: \"I try to get as much sleep as humanly possible. What makes it bearable is I have a built-in support system. I have Shawn and Shawn has me. We're always there for each other. We want to see each other succeed and we want to see the two of us succeed. We're certainly our best advocates.\"\nFor more on Shawn and Claire Buitendorp's clothing line, go to @shockandawww on Twitter and Instagram or their website, ShockandAwww.com.
