According to JoBlo , the movie will take place before the events of \" Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice \", which can mean that \"Wonder Woman\" is a prequel to the hero-against-hero movie. According to the source, \"Wonder Woman\" will be set both in World War I and in modern day, a few months before the events of \"Batman v Superman\". In the upcoming movie, Wonder Woman ( Gal Gadot ) will team up with Steve Trevor ( Chris Pine ) to destroy Circe who, along with Ares, becomes the masterminds of World War III. Circe and Ares will be the main villains in the movie, although Ares will only act behind-the-scenes, sending his army of beasts to kill the Amazonian princess. Besides, there is a rumor that the Caped Crusader will make appearance in the film, helping Diana fight Ares' demonic minions. However, it is not clear if Ben Affleck will portray Bruce Wayne in the upcoming movie. At the end of the film, Batman will approach Diana in some regard to let her know he is aware of her. That moment is when the two major superheroes establish a relationship that leads to Wonder Woman's involvement in \"Batman v Superman\". Additionally, fans can expect the appearance of the invisible jet. It will come into play when Wonder Woman and Trevor leave Paradise Island for the first time. Patty Jenkins is on board to direct the movie with Charles Roven, Zack Snyder, Deborah Snyder and Leonard Goldberg producing. \"Wonder Woman\" is scheduled for a U.S. release on June 23, 2017. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T05:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:07:11.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
