Just Click the Like Button Below Don't ask Again \nA controversy around industry's big head Dasari Narayana Rao and Ram Charan has become a daily soap by now. They take a dig at each other every now and then, which easily makes interesting headlines in tabloids. \nAfter their infamous war of words during Son Of Satyamurthy , Dasari is back again pointing out Ram Charan's hurry up in releasing Bruce Lee in Dusshera Race. \nDasari opined that big releases should atleast have a gap of two weeks and felt it would be nice if Ram Charan's Bruce Lee gets postponed, letting Rudhramadevi breathe in enough collections. \nAfter several postponements and delays, Rudhramadevi released on October 9 and as promised during the launch of the project in February, Bruce Lee makers are releasing the film on October 16, which is now attracting a lot of controversy. \nOn the other hand Akkineni scion's Akhil is slated to release on October 22, making the festive season jam packed. Dasari suggested that Bruce Lee should think of a later date as big films like it doesn't really need a festive season to make enough money. \nApparently, Charan had already reacted on this issue the other day and has let out his version. He recalled that they have announced the date 8 months in prior and it is not their fault if other films come for a clash. THERE YOU GO!
