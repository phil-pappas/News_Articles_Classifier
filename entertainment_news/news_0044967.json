She is raising her young daughter, has a loving relationship with lawyer Jonas (Alexander Fehling) and seems to find some comfort in visits to church. Carrie looks to be a long way from where she started in the spy drama, as an obsessive field agent buffeted by mental-health problems, though still better at the job than anyone else. Dedicated and fierce, she could also be impulsive and reckless, a loose cannon whom the intelligence agency couldn’t control, but also the kind of weapon  it needed to help fight its battles.\nLike its heroine, the series seems a long way from its origins in the story of US marine sergeant Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis), released following years of captivity in the Middle East. His publicly professed allegiances and private loyalties and his relationship with Carrie initially formed the heart of the show. Since his death, Homeland has been built around Carrie, although the past looms large, most obviously in the red-headed reality of her child with Brody. But while some things change, others remain the same. The show is still about the murky moralities of international espionage. Questions of loyalty and trust still loom large, as does the discussion of measures taken by the US and its allies in the fight against their enemies. The new season revs up with a topical, three-pronged plot. Refugees fleeing the war in Syria are flooding into camps across the border in Lebanon, and Otto is intent on making a trip to the troubled zone in order to pledge financial assistance. Meanwhile a couple of hackers have stumbled upon a cache of CIA files whose disclosure could embarrass Germany and the US and jeopardise relations between the countries. It’s a breach that causes problems for the CIA’s Berlin bureau chief, Allison Carr (Miranda Otto), and Carrie’s now-estranged mentor, Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin), who’s running the agency’s European operations. \nAdvertisement Then there’s Carrie’s former ally in the field, Peter Quinn (Rupert Friend), disillusioned and looking dead behind the eyes, who’s turned into a black-ops assassin and is coolly picking off targets covertly assigned to him by Saul. Plots thicken, the pace quickens, and, by the end of the second episode, Carrie discovers disturbing information about the past coming back to haunt her. It’s a solid set-up, leading to the persistent question of who can be trusted in a world where any of the characters could suddenly be revealed as treacherous.The impression of Carrie leading a contented life, of toddler birthday parties and visits to church, fades quickly as, once again, she’s under attack. Yes, Homeland is back.\nDebi Enker \nHouse Husbands (final) Nine, 8.40pm \nGemma and Abi are still fighting over Gemma’s betrayal. Justin and Rodney are still fighting for custody of Angie. Gemma is struggling with being a surrogate ‘‘oven’’ for Kane, Alex and Eve’s baby. Lewis is fighting with Miss Looby because he wants to be, um, an unqualified teacher. Local dramas on the commercial channels aren’t really my thing. Too often they pull their punches in favour of the happy-ever-afters. That said, this final episode was moving and, for a minute there, almost looked to take the difficult path with one story. Until it didn’t. Glossy as ever, House Husbands is neat viewing. Julia Morris is the standout, reining in her boisterous stand-up persona to play someone genuinely struggling. It is also worth staying to the end, as Gary Sweet cracks a smile for what feels like the first time in 20 years.   \nAmerican Horror Story, Eleven, 9.30pm \nShe calls her fans Little Monsters and takes great delight in dressing herself in meat, so it’s no surprise Lady Gaga has turned up on the new season of American Horror Story. She plays the Countess, the owner of Hotel Cortez, which  is being investigated by detective John Lowe (Wes Bentley).  The episodes are being fast-tracked (well, four days behind) from the US, so there was no preview available, however the show’s creators, Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, have promised that this is their darkest work yet. Heck, it even includes a demon wielding a drill bit dildo. Ouch. \nRise of the Machines, SBS, 9.30pm \nDespite the title, this – disappointingly – does not feature a resurrected Arnold Schwarzenegger hauling out the Terminator suit for another go around. Instead, it’s a documentary about a super-fast train in Italy. Exciting, huh? Well, yes, if you are my dad, who can sniff out documentaries about this kind of thing with alarming regularity. He’ll be in the backyard and catch the scent that How to Build Really Big Bridges (Again) is on 7Mate and off he goes, the afternoon lost to Big Stuff. So, this one’s for you, dad, and every semi-retired man aged between 60-100 who finds this stuff fascinating. It’s a train, made from ‘‘alooominum’’ (according to the overwrought American narration), that travels at 300km/h between Venice and Rome. Will it arrive on time? I don’t want to spoil it, but ... \nLouise Rugendyke", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T07:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:08:09.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
