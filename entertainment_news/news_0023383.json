Is that too serious? What if s/he's allergic to shellfish?!\" \nLet's try to ease the panic. \nWe've focused our attention on the social hubs around New Jersey which we think are best for first-date success. And we've identified those restaurants, bars and other fun activities through which daters determine if they actually connect with their evening companion/near stranger/future spouse/eventual loathsome enemy. \nFrom scenic walks to retro arcades to spark conversation to romantic (but not showoffy!) restaurants, each of these 25 choices is pretty much foolproof. If the night goes sour, you only have yourself — and the other person, of course — to blame. ASBURY PARK \nThis revitalized beachfront's downtown area, namely Cookman Avenue, is brimming with trendy, specialty restaurants, shops and oddities. For Monmouth and Ocean County locals, Asbury has quickly become the place to be seen. \nTalula's \nTalula's — a new gourmet pizza spot with a small bar — has quickly become popular for its personal pies and artisan cocktails. The staff is dedicated to farm-to-table, and the atmosphere is open and light. Definitely a sophisticated, city-centric vibe here. The first date is flexible here — in and out in an hour, or stay for a while, sip a fancy gin drink and chat about how you came to Asbury before it was cool. Vegan options available. Talula's in Asbury Park, offers a specialty bakery, pizza and bar menu. This is the \"Beekeeper's Lament\" and includes hot Calabrian soppressata, fresh mozzarella and local honey. (Russ DeSantis | For NJ Advance Media) \nCibo e Vino \nMost New Jerseyans have endured their fair share of \"decently priced Italian restaurant\" first dates. But Cibo e Vino , just off Cookman, serves its fare in \"cicchetti\" small plate smile. Everything is ripe for sharing, and you're not stuck slurping a pile of pasta as you try to make small talk. \nLangosta Lounge \nSushi is among the best first-date fare — shareable, not messy and assures your date you have a mature palette. And although the name suggests seafood, the sushi rolls at Langosta Lounge on the boardwalk are fantastic. The cocktail menu doesn't disappoint either. \nSilver Ball Museum \nIf you'd rather avoid the typical dinner-and-drinks procedure, go to the Asbury boardwalk and play pinball machines — many of which will be older than you and your date combined — at Silverball Museum. Nearly 200 machines dating back to the '50s await you, as do a few dozen old-school arcade games. And if you like your companion enough, make a little wager: \"if you win, I'll buy you dinner next time .\" (Get it?) Silverball is open year-round. HOBOKEN \nOne can imagine how many first dates must take place in Hoboken every day — the city is overflowing with young, single professionals ready to spend their lucrative paychecks. And there are plenty of spots to oblige. \nCork City \nIf you and your date share an affinity for brews, check out Cork City in Hoboken, a block off bustling Washington Street. One of the state's best beer bars features a running list (literally a digital scroll on flatscreen TVs) of more than 140 libations, an extremely knowledgable staff and all the usual beer extras. And it's a dog-friendly bar! No food, though. The Hudson River Waterfront Walkway in Hoboken is great for a stroll and incredible view of New York City. Awkward selfies abound! (Bobby Olivier | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com) \nHudson River Waterfront Walkway \nThe old, \"let's go for a walk\" idea takes new life on the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway, a man-made island and small park with a reach-out-and-touch-it view of the Manhattan skyline. And if you happen upon the park on a slow day, the playground is pretty sweet, even for adults. Your date will love that you can unleash your inner child and climb the jungle gym! \nPro tip: There's a huge, spinning disc at the park. AVOID laying on it and asking your date to spin you. Vomit rarely leads to a second date. \nOld German Bakery \nLet's be honest, any of the few-dozen restaurants and bars on Washington Street would likely suffice for a first date, but for a more eclectic after-meal snack, the Old German Bakery is a must. The apple strudel is a flaky delight, and even if the date goes south, at least you learned what a raspberry \"quark ball\" is. JERSEY CITY \nThe Jersey City first-date scene is similar to Hoboken — an increasing number of Jersey kids who want to work in the city but can't afford to live there. Luckily, romance can blossom on this side of the Hudson, too. \nPorta \nThis industrial-chic spot is popular in Jersey City (and Asbury Park) for its neapolitan-style pizzas and cocktails, as well as a trendy rooftop bar, which also offers food. The artisan salads are delicious, too — split some greens (the \"Fabio\" is very good) and a pie (the \"14 ½\" with soppressata is killer). It will be plenty of food for each of you, and you won't put too much of a dent in your wallet. Check out Liberty House for a fancier date and amazing view in Jersey City. (Kathryn Brenzel | NJ Advance Media) \nLiberty House \nFor the perfect Jersey City date with a view, try Liberty House. Located within Liberty State Park, the restaurant boasts a wonderful view of the New York City skyline, as well as very good food and drinks. Pick on some eggplant truffle fries and try to name the skyscrapers on the Lower West Side. But note this is a pricier place — only for the fancier first-daters or if you're really desperate to impress. \nBarCade \nFor the more grounded, beer-and-video games kind of evening, BarCade is the right mix of retro machines and craft brews. After all, is there a better way to spend a Friday night than sipping an IPA and trying to beat the \"Galaga\" high score with someone you find attractive? MONTCLAIR \nMontclair is a foodie destination, and the restaurant search here can be a serious task. But this is where to go if you commit to dining out. It's easy to spend a fortune on fine food here, so we picked a few options that won't immediately break your bank. \nLeone's \nMost cuisines have a formidable representative around town, but for a tasty, reasonably priced dinner, Leone's is a great spot. The Italian joint just off Bloomfield Avenue was featured on Gordon Ramsay's \"Kitchen Nightmares\" in 2011, and since the remodel has become the place for delicious pizza and pasta. The restaurant is BYOB. \nFun fact: This reporter has first-dated at Leone's. Memories of the meatballs are fonder than the relationship's ultimate fizzle — but do not let that discourage you. Raymond's in Montclair is ideal for a casual lunch date. (JERRY MCCREA/THE STAR LEDGER) \nRaymond's \nAn oldie but a goodie — Montclair's longstanding diner Raymond's is still a great place to meet up for lunch and dole out all those typical first date questions. While grilling your companion on his or her job and family, try the grilled chicken paillard, or the sensational eggs benedict. The eatery is surrounded by specialty shops, so gawking at overpriced furniture could be a nice after-meal activity. Just don't say, \"Hey, that would be a nice couch when we move in together.\" \nAdventureRooms \nYou want to gauge a potential mate's intelligence? Make them solve intricate puzzles with you and escape a room at AdventureRooms . Three different spaces force participants to use logic, reasoning and \"street smarts\" to find a way out before time expires. A little bit of sweat on the brow as the clock ticks down is always fun for a first date, right? Reservations required. MORRISTOWN \nWay-North Jerseyans know the Morristown Green and surrounding areas are ripe with locales for a memorable first date. French-Thai, taverns and epic grilled cheese adventures await! \nOrigin Thai \nCurious if your date can handle ordering off a menu of Thai food with a French influence? Then try Origin Thai , a tasty, more upscale spot just off the Green on South Street. The pad thai is great, or go for the escargot! It's pretty quiet at Origin, though — come prepared with some conversation starters. Also note, it's BYOB. The Thai-French fusion of Origin Thai in Morristown is a killer first date. (Frank Remshifski) \nGrasshopper Off The Green \nThe more casual choice in Morristown is Grasshopper , an Irish pub with a warm, wood-laden dining room. The food is typical tavern fare, but of course there's the homeland influence — there's no shame in a nursing a bowl of Guinness Irish beef stew and hoping for no red flags from your date. If you feel inclined to test his or her Premier League soccer knowledge, this is also the place — lots of international sports on TVs. \nThe Melt Factory \nOkay, so things are going well. You and your date have survived dinner (Morristown has dozens of options), had a few drinks and before you know it, it's 1 a.m. — and you're both hungry again. Fear not, the grilled cheese selection at The Melt Factory will close out the night in comfort, even if you don't seal the deal. NEW BRUNSWICK \nMore than 60,000 students attend Rutgers, and plenty of them will pair off and search for a place to chat that isn't a cafeteria or Stuff Yer Face. And for residents of all the other Brunswicks, these spots will work for you, too. \nOld Man Rafferty's \nThis is about as dependable as New Brunswick dining gets. Old Man Rafferty's is a comfortable place, with an extensive menu — if your date can't find something in their wheelhouse at OMR, they must not like food. Most everything, from salads to burgers is good, and reasonably priced. And their dessert menu is just as vast. What kind of gourmet hot dog someone chooses at Destination Dogs in New Brunswick is an important foundation for any relationship. (File photo) \nClydz \nAre you looking to assess your date's commitment skills? Bring them to Clydz and ask them to order a cocktail. The bar menu at this trendy spot is enormous — more than 120 options for vodka, gin, whiskey, tequila and more. Martinis are the specialty here, so give the Cajun Martini, or the Green Tea-ni a try. \nDestination Dogs \nSometimes first-daters just need to say \"hey, let's eat some fancy hotdogs and see if we like each other.\" Then Destination Dogs is the right place, as they serve up more than 30 types of wieners, franks and sausages. You'll quickly learn if the person can deal with a little mess — as they eat a dog covered in fried potatoes, bacon, maple syrup, and topped with a fried egg (The Paul Bunyan). Full bar here, too. Just try to save the weiner jokes for a second date. PRINCETON \nIn Princeton, a balance can certainly be struck between affordable and cultured. For university students or any Mercer County daters ready for night on the town, here are a few options. \nTriumph Brewing Company \nThis microbrewery might be the first date go-to for much of the surrounding Princeton area, but for good reason. Triumph's rotating list of craft beers is always good conversation fodder for the hop-savvy and the lunch and dinner menu is delicious. And it's across the street from Princeton University campus if you need to walk off your beef short rib. Triumph Brewing Company in Princeton is more than a microbrewery. Andrew Miller/For The Star-Ledger \nThe Bent Spoon \nIt might be tough to stretch an entire first date to revolve around ice cream, but if the night needs a sweet ending, the inventive flavors at The Bent Spoon are the way to go. The award-winning spot endlessly rolls out new, season-savvy flavors, so there's surely some sort of pumpkin or apple confections to try. \nWinberie's \nIf you've chosen a first date in Princeton, chances are there's an air of sophistication you hope to exude. What better says \"I've got my life together\" than a wine sampling at Winberie's at Palmer Square. Go midweek for \"Wine Wednesdays\" with half-price bottles, $5 glasses and $12 wine flights (three small glasses). The American-style food is fine, too — try the Shiitake Truffle Prime Burger. RED BANK \nOn the banks of the Navesink River lies a wonderful Monmouth County downtown, loaded with a month's worth of first date options. Here's a trio plucked from the list. \nThe Downtown \nOne of Red Bank's most popular, and well-rounded gathering meccas is The Downtown , a two-story spot offering tasty American and sushi, superior mixed drinks and often a talented cover band upstairs (much better musicians than the usual bar scene). An important distinction, though: if you hope to have meaningful conversation with your date, go earlier in the evening. The main restaurant area gets crowded quick and very loud. \nFun fact: This reporter had a first date at The Downtown, and two-and-a-half years later, he's still with his date! There's hope at The Downtown! A cheeseburger and salad from The Downtown in Red Bank are a solid first date choice. Stay for the cover bands! (Bobby Olivier | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com) \nRook Coffee \nFor the more casual coffeehouse date, stop by Rook Coffee, which since 2010 has become the Shore's go-to java joint through a handful of locations. If the date goes south, you still won't have regretted the delicious iced New Orleans-style brew. \nWords to the wise: \"Let's get coffee\" should never be counted as a first date on its own. If you end up leaving a shop and immediately grab food, or take a long walk or something, then okay. \nYesterCades \nThe selection of arcade and console games at YesterCades satisfies about 30 years-worth of inner nerds. You pay by the hour — no quarters — and there's the \"Pac-Man\"-era games, '90s machines (\"NBA Jam,\" anyone?) to pinball. But the crowning achievement might be several flat-screen TVs connected to a list of video game systems, including the millennial-coveted Nintendo 64. A \"Mario Kart\" first date is a good first date. \nBobby Olivier may be reached at bolivier@njadvancemedia.com. Follow him on Twitter @BobbyOlivier .
