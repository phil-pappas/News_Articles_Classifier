They released their fifth album, The Secret Service, last week, and started a UK tour the day after. They will play at the Engine Rooms in Southampton on Sunday. \nWe spoke to frontman Irwin Sparkes to find out more \nYou’ve been touring lots of universities lately. How have the shows been going? \nReally well. We’ve been having a lot of people come up to us and say our debut was the first album they ever bought, so it’s quite humbling. \nWhat a difference eight years can make. \nThe students look so young, it’s like playing to a room of drunk children, but that probably says a lot about how old I am. \nHow’s the new album? \nIt’s sizzling away in record shops and of course online. \nWe were right up to the deadline, but we needed that, and of course being on our own indie label means we can do more things ourselves, and faster. \nOur fourth album came out last year! \nYou were signed to RCA and dropped by them just after your second album came out. Do you miss the major label? \nYou’re always going to miss having the multi-million pound marketing budget behind you. Promoted stories \nWhen it comes to that, there’s a reason artists, even ones as big as Prince, go back to major labels to get their music out after leaving them. \nWhat can you do instead? \nThere is a lot we can do. Social media means we can get in touch with fans directly, for a start. \nMore importantly, it’s about managing expectation. There’s always pressure to be in the top three per cent that’s banging out number one singles, otherwise you’re not seen to be doing well. \nBut we are still releasing music, playing to crowds, and it’s taken some getting used to, but we’re pleased with it all. \nLots of bands would have split after being dropped... \nI think it’s testament to our stubbornness, determination and lack of having anything else to do. \nThat can't be true! \nNo. \nI have been writing with other artists, and the other members also have their own projects. We had a lot of mainstream appeal, and we weren’t up for the idea of curling up and dying. \nIt was worrying at the time, and we thought, ‘This is our life now’, when we were signed to the label, album, tour, album... We were No 1, and there was a lot of pressure to promote it, so I don’t miss that pressure. \nI can’t imagine what it must be like to be someone like Beyonce, with that expectation. Those stars just can’t be free to do what they want. \nWhat did the experience leave you feeling? Share article \nWe all handled it in different ways. For me, it didn’t sink in for a few years. Like whenever you’re having a bad time, there’s some denial and I think I held on to it a bit too tight. But after a while, I adjusted and what constitutes success for me has changed. Lots of people think artistic success is based on commercial success, but it’s not, and it took me a while not to equate commercial or chart success with artistic success. Being happy is a massive thing. And we’re all happy. \n* The Hoosiers play Southampton’s Engine Rooms on Sunday. Tickets from seetickets.com. Promoted Stories Sorry, an error occurred.
