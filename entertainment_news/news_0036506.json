What have I done?'\" \nThe comment sparked outrage online and among right-wing pundits, who heavily criticized the Brit over the gag. \nShe subsequently issued an apology, saying, \"It was so not the intention to hurt anybody or cause any offense so I really apologize to those that I caused offense (to). It was just an offhand joke... I think I'll probably leave the political jokes to (U.S. talk show) Late Night or something.\" \nEmily has now opened up about the controversy, revealing she was shocked by the vitriol aimed at her over what she thought was a harmless joke. \n\"It was a joke!... I was bummed,\" she told shock jock Howard Stern on his U.S. SiriusXM radio show. \n\"I was sort of astonished by the outrage, because it was meant completely as an innocuous joke. So I think I was more just quite taken aback, so it did bum me out... It was like catnip (for critics)... I think it does make you feel like you should be a little cagier...\" \nEmily, who is married to American comedian John Krasinski, goes on to reveal she passed her citizenship test with flying colors: \"It was hard. I did (study)... You have to get six out of 10 (questions) right, and I got the first six right... so they stopped... I do (feel good about being a U.S. citizen). I have a real affection for the country.\" Copyright WENN.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T22:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:04:33.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
