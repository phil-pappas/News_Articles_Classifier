Nigeria, which also recorded eight deaths out of 198 cases, was hailed for being proactive to avert a catastrophe. \nDanny Glover stars in the movie which tells the true story of men and women who risked their lives and made selfless sacrifices to save Nigeria from the consequences of the Ebola pandemic. \nSpeaking from the set of the movie in Nigeria, which happens to be his eighth in Africa, a year after the unfortunate epidemic, the 69-year-old actor told the BBC that he is excited about the focus of ‘93 Days’. \nHe noted that, “a part of that crisis is the reality, the part that we don’t see, the part that it is the human drama itself within that,” which is what the film is about. \n“Because what you got [people] saying in the United States often was the reflection on the fear and the fact that it may find its way onto our borders,” the multiple award winning actor added. \nDanny Glover plays the role of Dr Benjamin Ohiri, who runs a private hospital where the first Ebola case was detected and quarantined. He lost four of his colleagues to Ebola including Dr Stella Ameyo Adadevoh. \nNollywood actress Bimbo Akintola, who plays the role of Dr Ameyo Adadevoh, also told the BBC, the role as the illustrious doctor is a huge one. \n“There are certain words I heard from everyone; courageous, principled, stubborn when she believes in something, very warm. All the other doctors called her mum, she was like their mother,” she said. \nThe actress added that, “Her son said something that stayed with me; he said his dad’s mum is the person that misses her the most because she was in charge of so many [hearts]... I was like ‘ok that shows the sort of person she was.” \nBimbo Akintola recounted that, with Dr Ameyo Adadevoh’s home always full of people, she, in spite of her busy schedule, “somehow managed to find a balance between work and home...she was like a proper super woman.” \nThe movie, which is jointly produced by Native FilmWorks, Michel Angelo Production and Bolanle Austen-Peters Production, is expected to be release later this year or early next year. \n\nFollow me on Twitter: @delaXdela and Instagram: citizendela", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T13:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:15:06.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
