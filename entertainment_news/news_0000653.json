On Friday, Jeong turns his former day job as a physician in internal medicine for an HMO into ABC sitcom Dr. Ken (8:30 p.m. ET/PT), playing a more amplified, quirkier version of himself. \"I felt like Community was my Saturday Night Live in a number of ways,\" says Jeong, who says he's left his \"blood, sweat and tears\" on the soundstage of his new show.\nQ: You're writing, producing and starring in Dr. Ken. So do you sleep?\nA: This is an all-encompassing thing. Fortunately we have a very efficient showrunner named Mike Sikowitz, he's a godsend...I compare it to a football coach and a star quarterback kind of deal. It's a lot like that.\nQ: After six years on the ensemble comedy Community, what was the biggest transition to Dr. Ken ?\nA: Looking back (on) Community , I was just an actor on the show. I was never in the writer's room. When I started Community in '09, I had just quit my day job as a doctor, like, two years prior. I had no experience in television. I was green as grass…(with Dr. Ken ) it's all about the ensemble, even though my name's all over it and it's based on my life. We have seven strong cast members. I always followed that Community model of it's all about the ensemble first.\nQ: Critics have been tough on Dr. Ken's pilot. Has the show changed?\nA: Absolutely. That's what bugs me a lot – I'll be brutally honest. Sometimes critics will judge a pilot – but that's all they have to go on, (and) a lot of times when you're writing a pilot, and I was in it from day one, you're trying to sell something to a network. You're really just introducing a world. These episodes (we're shooting) right now, I tell you man, it's so good. It's exactly what I want this to be.\nKen Jeong, a medical doctor in real life, plays a doctor in the new series, 'Dr. Ken.' (Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY)\nQ: Are there specific incidents from your medical career that made the show?\nA: There are a ton. Even in the pilot, the patient who thinks what he has is just a hemorrhoid and I'm urging him to have a colonoscopy, that's based on an amalgamation of real-life patient encounters. There's a patient in an upcoming episodewho's non-compliant with her thyroid medication, she's worried about gaining weight. That happens all the time.\nQ: People will be surprised to learn you weren't the Patch Adams of your practice.\nA: Patients will tell you, I was really intense. I was really serious. Even here (on set) I'm intense and serious about my job. I want to deliver a good product. My work ethic here is really high and my work ethic as a doctor was naturally high.\nQ: So, basically, you were the prickly doc you played in Knocked Up .\nA: (Laughs) That was based on a couple of other doctors, and maybe a version of me on a really bad day.\nQ: How often do you get hit up for medical advice?\nA: On every project I've ever done I've always had one person, cast or crew, come up to me. I don't mind, since I don't practice anymore. When I was in H angover 2 in Bangkok, I was in my Mr. Chow gear doing something godawful, and I'm saying a lot of really bad things.\" Then he got a medical phone call: 'I think you might have really bad e-coli food poisoning' … Zac (Galifaniakis), Ed (Helms) and Bradley (Cooper) are looking at me like 'What the eff is going on?\nQ: Margaret Cho guest stars as your sister on Dr. Ken . How far do you two go back?\nA: I was in med school in North Carolina, (I went to) Duke undergrad. The Duke Asian Association booked her to do stand-up over 20 years ago, even before (2003 ABC comedy) All American Girl , and I was her opening act.\nQ: What's been the biggest surprise putting an Asian-American comedy on network TV?\nA: What has really been pleasantly surprising is the lack of ethnic notes (from the network). It's never about that, it's just about the comedy (or) the story. History will look back at this time for Asian-Americans as the beginning of a prosperous time, and ABC is at the forefront of it. They have not one but two Asian-American sitcoms ( Fresh Off the Boat ). And they are championing them both equally and in different ways … Look what Viola Davis said in her Emmys speech. It moved me and my wife to tears. You don't hear me talk about it a lot but it's true. (Minorities) are not given the same opportunity. That's just a fact.\n64 CONNECT 29 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 //usat.ly/1KM6Z6D TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://usat.ly/1FFikGR", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1KM6Z6D&mini=true", "http://usat.ly/1KM6Z6D", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1KM6Z6D&text=Q%26A%3A%20%27Dr.%20Ken%27%20is%20in%20the%20house&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b227424a590d14c40a68676a948092c288a7e29f/r=337x400/local/-/media/2015/09/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/635791508092499728-MAIN-COVER-IMAGE-KEN-JEONG-76351130.JPG", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/09/29906170001_4519708496001_Dr-Ken-Thumb1.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/09/29906170001_4519650280001_Dr-Ken-Thumb2.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/aabf151c8cb4eec435eda4cfd9758c64eec9406a/c=0-60-2814-2176&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/09/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/635791508208720473-V2MAIN-COVER-IMAGE-KEN-JEONG-76350794-1-.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34f3c12e46e775b6bc7e523d797ba40d553715a7/r=540&c=540x304/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/09/29906170001_4519708496001_Dr-Ken-Thumb1.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/635791508092499728-MAIN-COVER-IMAGE-KEN-JEONG-76351130.JPG", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/09/29906170001_4519708496001_Dr-Ken-Thumb1.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2e2245862c0c304f24ba200173a2e0742ed61154/c=149-0-2517-3157&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/09/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/635791508092499728-MAIN-COVER-IMAGE-KEN-JEONG-76351130.JPG"], "published": "2015-09-30T23:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:51:07.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
