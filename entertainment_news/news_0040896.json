For those that want to enter the competition, children are invited to create a one minute ‘How To’ video, displaying any build of their choice. Extra points are provided to those that incorporate a Sci-Fi or Film theme, with themselves as the main character. \nLea Shelford, Organiser from Events Frontier, said: “Our motto is to promote reading and illustration through the medium of comics and graphic novels and the Dev Con events help us to show that this can be done by engaging the imagination and having fun. \n“We have been hosting these events for a few years now and they are really well-received and popular. The sci-fi genre isn’t just popular with children but budding entrepreneurs, actors and sci-fi enthusiasts - of all ages. It’s a lovely weekend and I’d encourage everyone to unlock their imagination and dive in!” \nTickets can be bought in advance, from Final Frontier stores in Plymouth, Exeter or St Austell, or bought on the day at the Plymouth Guildhall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T14:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T18:15:22.182+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
