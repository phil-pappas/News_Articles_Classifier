The photos give a glimpse at Zellweger as pregnant Bridget Jones hanging around at a Sainsbury's store. Zellweger was spotted filming the third installment of \"Bridget Jones\" movie series in Woolwich, London on Tuesday, October 6. The 46-year-old actress showed off her fake pregnancy bump beneath a blue wolly coat. She wore a navy blue striped top and a pair of ripped jeans which she teamed with a pair of black leather boots. Patrick Dempsey and Sally Phillips, who plays Jones' best friend Shazza, were also spotted on the filming location. The movie is expected to be based on Helen Fielding's third book, \"Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy\", which was released in 2013. Meanwhile, another source suggested that the movie might be based on Fielding's old columns, in which Jones is a mum-of-two and her partner has died. The upcoming movie also stars Colin Firth as Jones' love interest Mark Darcy with Dempsey taking on a new role in Jones' life. Sharon Maguire, who directed the original \"Bridget Jones's Diary\" in 2001, will return to direct the upcoming film with a script she co-wrote with David Nicholls. Plot details are kept under wraps, but the photos suggest that Jones will indeed have a baby in the third film of the series. Produced by Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner, the movie is expected to hit U.S. theaters next year. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Bridget Jones's Baby News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:55:09.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
