Transported back to 1759 for the Siege of Québec and Battle of the Plains of Abraham and to 1760 for the Battle of Sainte-Foy in this original, true-to-life experience, the public is now invited to experience this one-of-a-kind immersive projection bringing together history and high tech in a mind-blowing extravaganza. Quick Facts Battles 1759–1760 is an amazing journey featuring an outstanding multimedia presentation and a lively exhibition to plunge dazzled audiences into the crucible of the Seven Years' War, a pivotal event that changed the destiny of a continent. Original first-hand accounts from French, British, Canadian, and First Nations participants is the often poignant basis for Battles 1759–1760 , where audiences re-live the Battles of the Plains of Abraham and Sainte-Foy through the writings of 17 contemporary witnesses. Four separate perspectives merge into a moving, lively shared vision of this dramatic chapter of our history. The new, specially created lighting projection touches the emotions while remaining true to history. The vivid soundscape, realistic narrative, and original hand-created illustrations create at times an impression of living the conflict. Battles 1759–1760 is the successor to Odyssey: A Journey Through History on the Plains of Abraham , which ran for 15 years and was experienced by close to 300,000 visitors in the course of its run. The battle theme is a response to multiple requests from individuals and from school and tour groups. Battles 1759–1760 has of course kept the big hits often cited by visitors to the Plains of Abraham Museum (formerly the Discovery Pavilion of the Plains of Abraham), such as the exclusive collection of some 20 faithful reproductions of French and British military uniforms of the period, items from a soldier's daily life in 1759–1760, interactive games, and the giant maps showing the geography of the Seven Years War. Battles 1759–1760 is available in French or in English and its pricing is: $30 for families, $4 for age 5–12, $10 for age 13–17, and $12 for age 18–64.
