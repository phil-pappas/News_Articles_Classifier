That feels like hell.\" \nThe 39-year-old star - who was one of the two to survive the fiery crash - has recalled the last thing he thought of when the plane plummeted to the ground after takeoff. \nHe explained: \"I'm so soaked in jet fuel and then we realise, we're out of the plane, and then the plane explodes.\" \nTravis, who has son Landon, 12, and daughter Alabama, nine, with his ex-wife Shanna Moakler, previously admitted surviving the horrific plane crash inspired him to stop using drugs, including Xanax, Vicodin and Oxycontin. \nHe explained previously: \"I've done more drugs than I'd like to say and my memory sucks. I went from being a little punk abusing stuff to having a second chance at life. \n\"I didn't want to take advantage of it. Being sober is the best thing that's ever happened to me. My son is like, 'It's good you're sober, Dad. \"It shows you can be a bona fide rock star and don't need to be a drug addict.\" blink-182", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T12:27:55.167+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
