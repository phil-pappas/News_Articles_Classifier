These F words have helped her and will guide you to develop positive life experiences.\n“Fear is paralyzing! The time has come for the negative thoughts and limiting beliefs that are instilled in us to be liberated,” Brandt said. “This book, ‘The F’s to God,’ may help people see their lives in a uniquely energetic way. Divine energy needs to flow freely on this planet in order to survive. People can use the tools in this book to help divine energy flow to occur.”\nPublished by New York City-based Page Publishing, Brandt’s motivational work talks about how with the help of Archangels, and through her Reiki Master Attunement, she is able to sense issues that people have in all four facets of their being (emotional, mental, physical, and spiritual).\nThe author’s encounters presented in this book can help readers to better understand their own experiences. Anyone who has had a paranormal experience or lost a loved one, and military personnel who have been overseas or experienced multi-deaths, may consider reading this book to gain a better understanding of non-divine energy.\nReaders who wish to experience this inspiring work can purchase “The F’s To God” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708.\nAbout Page Publishing\nPage Publishing is a traditional New York based full-service publishing house that handles all of the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
