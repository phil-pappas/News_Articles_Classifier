I've been trying to get my s**t together and I'm doing pretty damn good. \n\"I just really had to take a look at myself and my life and the way s**t was going and all the crazy stupid s**t I was doing and just finally admit to myself that it wasn't working.\" \nHe added: \"A couple months ago I was selling coke [and] doing coke until I couldn't even snort it up my nose anymore because it was so clogged. I even smoked crack.\" \nThe musician believes his struggles with addiction stem for his lifestyle in the public eye and his difficulty trying to \"fit in\" and follow in his famous father's footsteps. \nHe explained: \"It's been a long journey discovering who I am because all the pressures that I've dealt with in my life -- you know, being the son of my dad and everything.\" \nChet's revelation comes just three months after he was sought after by police for allegedly smashing up a four-star hotel room at Gatwick Airport, just outside of London, after three women reportedly refused to have sex with him. \nA few days prior to that incident, Chet - the second youngest son of Tom and his wife Rita Wilson - allegedly had his Instagram account suspended for using the N-word in a series of posts, which he heavily defended as \"free speech.\" cocaine", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:41:56.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
