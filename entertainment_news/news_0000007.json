Area Democrats hope to continue the winning streak. , SUSAN WALSH, ASSOCIATED PRESS Related article » DEMS DEBATE When: Coverage begins at 5:30 p.m.\nWhere: Wynn resort, Las Vegas\nCandidates: Lincoln Chafee, Hillary Clinton, Martin O'Malley, Bernie Sanders, Jim Webb\nHow to Watch/Listen: CNN/CNN.com. Westwood One News will broadcast the debate on its radio stations.\nBarack Obama not only gave America its first black president. He gave Inland Democrats momentum.\nIn 2008, Obama became the first Democratic presidential candidate since Bill Clinton in 1992 to win Riverside and San Bernardino counties. He repeated the feat in 2012, a year Democrats won several hotly contested races for Inland offices.\nAs they gather to watch the first debate of Democratic White House hopefuls Tuesday, Oct. 13, local Democrats hope to keep the trend going for their party’s 2016 nominee.\n“We worked awfully hard for President Obama,” said Howard Katz, chairman of the Riverside County Democratic Central Committee. “That’s going to be repeated (in 2016).”\nScott Mann, chairman of the Republican Party of Riverside County, said delivering the county for the GOP nominee is a top priority.\n“Frankly, neither (Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders) have the star power that President Obama had,” Mann said. “He was able to get out the vote unlike any other Democratic candidate in decades.”\nTraditionally, the Inland Empire has been a Republican bastion in a state that traditionally favors Democrats. Statewide, registered Democratic voters outnumbered registered Republicans 43 to 28 percent as of February.\nBut in Riverside County, Republicans hold a 4 percentage point edge in voter registration. Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans 38 to 34 percent in San Bernardino County.\nDemocrats are on a winning streak when it comes to competitive Inland elections. State Sen. Richard Roth, Assemblyman Jose Medina and Rep. Mark Takano, all Riverside Democrats, defeated well-funded Republicans in 2012, the same year Democrat Raul Ruiz staged a come-from-behind win against veteran GOP congresswoman Mary Bono.\nLast year, Democrat Pete Aguilar survived a competitive primary and a challenge from Republican Paul Chabot to win a San Bernardino County congressional seat vacated by a Republican. Also in 2014, Ruiz won re-election in a Riverside County district where the GOP has a slight voter-registration advantage.\nObama won San Bernardino County with 52 percent of the vote in both his presidential elections. In Riverside County, he squeaked out a win over Republican Mitt Romney in 2012 and beat GOP nominee John McCain by roughly 2 percentage points in 2008.\nTo end the Democrats’ winning streak with Obama, Mann said local Republicans are actively recruiting voters. An “aggressive” get-out-the-vote effort will launch “at the appropriate time,” he said.\nKatz said local Democrats will meet later this month to strategize for the 2016 election. He recalled what Inland Democrats did to help Obama, including knocking on doors, handing out literature and selling buttons and T-shirts.\nWhich presidential candidate wins the Inland Empire might come down to how each party’s voters feel about their nominee. A nonpartisan Field Poll released last week showed support for Clinton among likely voters in California’s Democratic primary slipping, with support for Sanders growing from February to October of this year.\nKatz said he has noticed more enthusiasm from Sanders supporters compared to Clinton’s. “Bernie brings out that kind of emotionalism,” he said, adding that Sanders and Clinton are both well-qualified for the White House.\nOne factor in Democrats’ favor is the growing ranks of Inland Latinos. As a group, Latinos tend to vote for Democrats.\n“Any credible Democrat has a good chance in the Inland Empire, provided that Hispanic Democratic turnout is strong,” said Jack Pitney, a professor of politics at Claremont McKenna College.\nHowever, if Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Cuban American, wins the GOP nomination, “the advantage could shift to the Republicans,” Pitney said.\nContact the writer: 951-368-9547 or jhorseman@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw4ok1-b88532661z.120151012151422000gdicggjc.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw4ok1-b88532661z.120151012151422000gdicggjs.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw4ok0-b88532661z.120151012151422000ggbchput.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw4ok0-b88532661z.120151012151422000ggbchput.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw4ok1-b88532661z.120151012151422000gdicggjs.10.jpg", "http://files.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/graphics/PE_DEBATEPREVIEW_1013B.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw4ok1-b88532661z.120151012151422000gdicggjc.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:22:10.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
