As you can probably guess, the color palette for this new season will feature earthier tones and then shift into richer, deeper hues as we head toward winter. This fall, you will see the continuing trend of Pantone’s naturally robust wine-red color, marsala, which will manifest itself in various tones, including cashmere rose (a dusty, delicate blush), as well as the usual suspects of herb greens, chocolates and grays. Although September can be a tricky fashion month, as we are still basking in warm, sunshiny days, the mornings and evenings tend to dip into the chillier side of the thermometer. It is time to do the changeover and place your boho-chic summer essentials in the back of the closet and make room for fall’s sophisticated style. Drift into autumn It may not be quite the right time to bust out all of your toasty-warm fall fashions, but you can certainly incorporate a few autumnal pieces into the mix as you slowly transition into colder temps. Rag & Bone The Dre Skinny Boyfriend Jeans with flannel plaid patchwork ($355, Perch) are to-die-for! The tartan medley gives your cool factor an injection of grunge, and although they are cut like skinny-minnie jeans, Rag & Bone has done an excellent job of blending in the relaxed, boyfriend fit. Sport these denims with the Nili Lotan Buttondown Shirt in Indigo Stripe ($255, Perch), or if the temperature takes a slight nosedive, layer on a super-comfy, easy-fit sweater such as the White + Warren Chevron V Neck in Chianti ($335, Perch) or the P.J. Salvage Boucle Knit Sweater in ivory, blush or gray ($77, Lacy’s and Allegria Spa). As we get deeper into September and date nights become crisper, warm up your wardrobe in a pair of brown Sfizio Pants ($207, Blitz Boutique), which are mid-rise and feature a slim, tapered leg highlighting a black and white stripe. Pair the pants with the Beatrice B Plaid Tunic ($275, Blitz Boutique). Model a true Throwback Thursday retro style — the “not your mother’s cardigan” worn backward look — and throw on the Loma Stripe Button Back Sweater in Army ($395, Perch) with a pair of your favorite dark jeans or cigarette pants. If the evening calls for one more layer, but you are under no circumstances pulling out anything even remotely made of down, the beyond-chic P.J. Salvage Shag Vest ($66, Lacy’s, Allegria Spa and Frinje) is an excellent choice to finish your look. Fall is the perfect time to invest in a seasonal handbag that can be used through the winter. The Graf & Lantz Chadwick Bag ($345, Perch) is a unique, soft Merino wool felt tote featured in the season’s hues and is au courant alternative for day or evening. Accessorize your ensemble When it comes to adding jewelry to your ensemble, sometimes the more delicate pieces become the most impactful components to making your outfit work. Bloom Jewelry recently introduced its new b.line, which features stones that represent birth months and healing properties. You will find Bloom Jewelry’s b.line at Perch: b.leather bracelet, b.canvas bracelet, b.charm necklace, b.charm bangle, b.monogram bracelet, b.necklace and the skinny bangle (prices ranging from $55 to $90). If you are not quite ready to ditch the notion of summer, you can still show off an early fall pedi in a pair of Reef Stargazer Flip Flops ($27, Ptarmigan Sports). These cushy, glittery flippers are the ultimate post-hike shoes after sprinting up Berry Picker. Spending your lazy days of summer wallowing on the river with full sun exposure can create an uneven skin tone. To brighten up your style and recharge your skin, try the Merle Norman Revitalizing Bubbly Mask ($30, Merle Norman), which takes post-sun-kissed skin from dull to dazzling with its new multi-sensory formula. The time-released antioxidants soothe, condition and improve skin clarity and skin tone while Vivillume (a plant-based compound) helps renew your skin’s radiance and vitality. You will know the Revitalizing Bubbly Mask is working because it literally transforms from gel to foam while on your face.
