paste in your message / Comments (0) \nImitation is often regarded as the highest form of flattery, and in the hit-and-hope world of the tribute band, fans have an opportunity to relive the sights and sounds of long lost talents or performers way past their prime. \nWhile there are half-hearted acts out there stealing the pennies off a dead man's eyes, there are a number of bands out there whose devotion guarantees the magic of their favourite artist lives on â€“ none more so than Jackson Live, Limehouse Lizzy, One Night of Queen and T.Rextasy who are all heading to Frome to respectfully pay tribute to the much-missed showmanship of Michael Jackson, Phil Lynott, Freddie Mercury and Marc Bolan. \nMichael Jackson is fondly remembered as one of the most profoundly influential artists of all time. \nHis impressive career spanned almost five decades, and he was continually at the forefront of popular music, being crowned as he is now, the undisputed King of Pop. \nJackson Live in Concert, which comes to Frome's Memorial Theatre on Saturday, October 17, sees long-time fan and hugely talented Ben Bowman recreate the Michael Jackson experience with his stunning rendition of all his favourite songs. \nBen's portrayal of Michael Jackson has to be the most vocally and visually accurate tribute to the King of Pop to have ever toured UK theatre. \nOn Saturday, November 21, Limehouse Lizzy returns to the town to rock the Cheese and Grain. \nRenowned for an action-packed pyrothechnic-fuelled explosion of a show, Limehouse Lizzy continue to keep the spirit of Celtic rock icon Philip Lynott and his band Thin Lizzy alive, well and dominating stages worldwide. \nThe band have also added a tribute into their show to former -Thin Lizzy guitarist (and world renowned solo artist) Gary Moore who sadly passed away in 2011. \nExpect more of the Celtic influenced tracks like Whisky in the Jar and Black Rose, among the usual razzamatazz and classic tracks The Boys are Back in Town, Sarah and many others we've come to expect from one of the most highly rated acts on the circuit. \nOne Night of Queen performed by Gary Mullen & The Works comes to Frome's Memorial Theatre on Saturday, November 21. \nIn 2000, Gary Mullen won ITV's Stars In Their Eyes live grand final, with the largest number of votes ever received in the shows history. \nGary began touring on his own and in 2002 formed a band The Works, to pay tribute to rock legends Queen. \nSince May 2002, Gary Mullen & The Works have performed to sell-out audiences around the world. \nThe outfit have also twice rocked the prestigious BBC Proms in the Park, in front of a crowd of 40,000. \nExpect all the legendary favourite Queen hits including Another One Bites The Dust, Bohemian Rhapsody, Don't Stop Me Now, Fat Bottomed Girls, Radio Ga Ga, We Are The Champions and We Will Rock You. \nWith a career spanning more than 20 years, T.Rextasy have toured worldwide and have the blessing and support from Marc's family and former T.Rex members, including June Bolan (Marc's wife), Gloria Jones (Marc's girlfriend), Rolan Bolan (Marc's son), Mickey Finn (T.Rex conga player), Tony Visconti (T.Rex producer), and others. \nThey were also voted The Best Live Tribute Band in the UK by the BBC. \nExpect all the T-Rex classics such as Telegram Sam, 20th Century Boy, Metal Guru, Get It On and Children Of The Revolution.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T10:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T14:39:25.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
