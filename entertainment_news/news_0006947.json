The gaffe-prone rapper was in attendance of a West Coast fundraising event where no less than President Barack Obama provided counsel should West try to jump from the recording studio to the White House.\nSpeaking to a snickering crowd, Obama left the presidential hopeful with three hard-hitting pieces of advice:\n“First of all, you’ve got to spend a lot of time dealing with some strange characters who behave like they’re on a reality TV show. So, you’ve got to be cool with that,” said the president. Points for a two-birds-one-stone Donald Trump /Kanye West dig.\nNext Obama advised, “Saying that you have a ‘ beautiful dark twisted fantasy ’ -- that’s what’s known as off-message in politics. You can’t say something like that. There are a lot of people who have lost their congressional seats saying things like that.” This could be tough advice to follow for the rapper/professional butt-in.\nLastly, Obama hit West where it really hurts: “And number three, do you really think that this country is gonna elect a black guy from the Southside of Chicago with a funny name to be President of the United States? That is crazy.” Total shutdown or a 'get on my level' provocation?\nSo. Who’s looking forward to 2020?\nWatch video of the speech below:", "external_links": ["http://bigstory.ap.org/article/14555734388049428fc3eb85075a066b/obama-gives-kanye-west-some-tips-his-presidential-run", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/mhFW2dK_sxk", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003X2O6KW"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T21:12:46.422+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
