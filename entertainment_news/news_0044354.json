A year later, Iran's late leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa, or edict, calling for Rushdie's death.\nIran has also offered over $3 million in reward for anyone who kills Rushdie.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-08T11:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T14:21:15.647+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
