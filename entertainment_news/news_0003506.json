He runs Haunted Finders with his father David Cranfield, 56, and brother John, 24, and between them they investigate reports of the paranormal. It is believed that the ghosts on Cannock Chase are of the three children murdered by car mechanic Raymond Leslie Morris in the 1960s. \nDuring their hunt, Mr Buckmaster from Arnold, Nottingham, claims his team were chased by the figure, which threw a rock at them and warned him ‘We’re watching’. Can you see her? New footage allegedly shows the mystic Black-eyed Child \nHe said: “It looks like a child dressed in white – you can see the legs moving as it walks. I didn’t even know I had captured the ghost until I went over the footage and thought, ‘What the hell was that?’ You could hear running on the footpath behind us. At one point a rock was rolled quickly from behind me and through the group, out of nowhere. \n“We use a device called a spirit box, which is basically a modified radio system. \n“We got weird voices on there – there were footsteps, and voices saying, ‘We’re watching, we’re looking’ and then a male voice saying, ‘he’s coming’.” More Cannock Chase stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T13:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:09:10.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
