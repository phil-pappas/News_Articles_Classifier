More > \nBy Shelli Weinstein, \nKanye West says that he has faced discrimination in his career, but it's not because he's black: it's because he's not gay. \nDuring an almost two-hour interview with SHOWstudio on Tuesday West discussed the subject of discrimination, particularly how it relates to his foray into the fashion industry. \n\"I feel like I got discriminated in fashion for not being gay,\" he said. \"In music, you definitely get discriminated in music if you are gay. It takes amazing talents to break down barriers. Everyone thought that when Frank Ocean dropped that it was going to be bad for his career. I feel like it's so clich√© to speak about him as it relates to this subject, but there are people who broke the ground and he broke the ground. The people that break the stereotypes make history.\" \nIn summation: Kanye believes that he's making history in fashion because he's a straight man. \nKim Kardashian's due date is Christmas day \nThe rapper also discussed such groundbreaking individuals in reference to Caitlyn Jenner , who previously credited him for opening Kim Kardashian 's mind about her transition. \n\"The first thing I thought about was a black radio show host maybe possibly making jokes because the black culture is generally homophobic,\" he said. \"Then it was like, 'F--- what people say. F--- what people think.' I feel proud to be in a family that has so many people breaking ground for generations to come. I'm still getting acquainted to what's politically correct [to say].\" \nWatch the full interview here (last-chance warning that it runs two hours), in which Kanye continues his fashion discussion, compares himself to Michelangelo and brags about the Kardashian family's influence on the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:27:14.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
