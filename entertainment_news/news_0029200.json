It wasn’t. Velvet was created by its director Craig Ilott — the Helpmann Award-winning director behind sellout hits such as Sydney Festival’s Smoke And Mirrors and the recent B-Girl — over three years. And he’s outdone himself, which is a pretty high bar to clear.\nMarcia Hines and Brendan Maclean post Maclean’s awakening Picture: Liam Kidston Velvet unfolds as a kind of high-octane disco dream, with the tracks variously sung by stars Marcia Hines and Brendan Maclean, dressed as a kind of hapless dag, wondering into a world that excites, delights and yet puzzles him, but ultimately allows him to be reborn, much like a butterfly emerging from a pupae.\nThe music is delivered from on high by musical director come DJ Joe Accaria and it’s full of aural awesomeness from the disco canon, many reimagined in ways that tease out those elements that made them classics in the first place. Among them are the likes of Boogie Wonderland, If You Could Read My Mind, It’s Raining Men and a version of Stayin’ Alive that is simply exquisite.\nStephen Williams hunks it up in Velvet Vocals are delivered by the charismatic young Maclean and the divine and ageless Hines, sometimes as duets, with support from dynamic dancer-singers Chaska Halliday and Rechelle Mansour.\n The stage is set up as a catwalk and for the most part the vocal action unfolds at the back and around the physical performances unfolding upfront.\nThe phwoarr factor is sky-high in all this, with gasps accompanying the likes of an incredible series of athletic efforts from aerialist Stephen Williams, amping the hunk factor up to 11, and a tastefully teasing strip from burlesque performer Perle Noire.\nAcrobat Mirko Kockenberger brought a lightness of heart to proceedings while the aerial elegance of former ballet dancer Emma Goh was another delight.\nThe biggest revelation of the evening, however, was The Incredible Hula Boy Craig Reid. Odd as it might sound, seeing his ample figure wield hula hoops in physically improbable ways is as funny as it is jaw-dropping.\nIt might be driven by songs you know and circus arts you have seen before, but Velvet will reintroduce them in ways that make it all new again. A wonderful, joyous night out.\nVelvet, The Studio, Sydney Opera House, October 6-November 1, $35-$89, sydneyoperahouse.com", "external_links": ["http://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/whatson/velvet.aspx?sitesource=homepage&sitemedium=hn&campaign=velvet15", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/84bbff6ab76cdb152e1bfacba74aca51", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/661d28ba08499db58de471efcb975ce8", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e0ecc9764913631058b7c705f58abf7d", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/3a60c2675160de8b979da0b1bfc9c98b?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/66fa58f3fe82a85da51248d48a4fa31a", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/83cac281a28f0049927abef9b4410901?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/7f9c8d60468fee74cfd347f61cd6227b", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ea6ca1a98282e6bba934db59ccd98576"], "published": "2015-10-09T10:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:18:55.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
