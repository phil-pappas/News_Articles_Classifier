That happened three times during his freshman season, but it is the first time he doesn’t have a catch in back-to-back games.\n“Of course everybody wants the ball in their hands, but whatever role they need to play, I’m cool with that,” Blazevich said. “I know a lot of times it’s not that they aren’t throwing to me, it’s not as simple as that.”\nBlazevich’s slip in production isn’t pronounced. He has only five catches this year compared to nine through six games last season. Add in Jay Rome and Jackson Harris, and the tight end position has only 11 catches this season.\nLike Blazevich’s numbers, there isn’t a notable dropoff from last season — where the tight ends had 16 catches through the first six games. But the tight ends this year are on pace for the fewest catches in the Mark Richt era. Assuming the Bulldogs make a bowl game and continue on their current rate, the position will finish with 23 catches and 312 yards over the course of 13 games.\nIn 2007, the tight ends finished with 24 catches and 307 yards as well as three touchdowns. The current crop of tight ends have zero this season.\nRicht got a little testy earlier this week when the dip in production at the position was brought up.\n“The reality is we have progression reads and we are gonna throw it to this guy if he is open and, if not, we will throw it to that guy,” Richt said. “And sometimes the tight end is open, we throw it to him and sometimes he doesn’t.”\nBlazevich added he could do a better job of getting open on routes, while also agreeing with Richt’s point on not always being the primary progression.\nRicht did bring up the team almost always has one tight end in the game, and more times than not, the offense employs two tight ends on each play. Blazevich and Rome both reiterated they want to do whatever they can to make the team better.\nAnd if that means more run blocking, then so be it.\n“We’ve always had great running backs and we always will have running backs here at Georgia, and part of being a great tight end is being able to run block,” Rome said.\nNeither Rome nor Blazevich could specifically point out any differences with new offensive coordinator and play caller Brian Schottenheimer.\nSchottenheimer admitted he wanted to get Blazevich specifically more involved in the passing game plan two weeks ago.\nBlazevich hasn’t caught a pass since then, but Rome still has faith in his coordinator.\n“Coach Schottenheimer is trying to get the tight ends in the game plan, whether it be in run blocking or as a pass catcher,” Rome said.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14813115.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14813115.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:05:53.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
