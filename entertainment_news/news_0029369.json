Castor Jr., speaks during an interview with The Associated Press in Norristown, Pa. Castor is campaigning to become the county's district attorney again as the Republican nominee, but Democratic challenger Kevin Steele introduced a 30-second ad on Tuesday, Oct. 20, 2015, to remind voters that Castor declined to bring charges against entertainer Bill Cosby in 2005, after a former Temple University employee alleged Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her.
