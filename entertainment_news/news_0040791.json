(AP) — Jane Fonda’s ranch in northern New Mexico has finally sold after going on the market more than a year ago. \nThe Swan Land Co. of Bozeman, Montana, confirmed Thursday that the actress’s Forked Lightning Ranch just north of Santa Fe has a buyer. \n“It’s an iconic northern New Mexico ranch located on the Pecos that generated a lot of national attention,” said Mike Swan, the owner of the real estate company. \nSwan would not release any details about the terms of the sale or the sales price due to confidentiality agreements. The original listing price was $19.5 million. \nSwan did say the buyer was “local” and had ties to New Mexico. \nFonda bought the ranch in 2000 and spent two years scouting the property in search of the perfect location to build a new 9,600-square-foot home. It was featured in the March 2014 issue of Architectural Digest. \nAt the time it was listed, Fonda said in a statement that the ranch had been a sanctuary and a place of joy and recreation for her and her family. Due to changes in her life, she said she was no longer able to spend as much time at the ranch and felt it was time to pass it on to a new owner. \nThe ranch also includes a hacienda and a barn that were designed by renowned New Mexico architect John Gaw Meem in his signature Pueblo Revival style. \nThe ranch was created in 1925 after the rodeo promoter and “King of the Rodeo” John “Tex” Austin purchased a series of parcels from the Pecos Pueblo Grant. The ranch once belonged to Dallas oilman E.E. “Buddy” Fogelson, who married actress Greer Garson in 1949. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:59:50.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
