In a field riddled with caveats, “99.9 percent” constitutes the kind of “virtual certainty” that is simply not possible, Graves said.\nThe study, a team effort from UC Irvine and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, projected a magnitude 5.0 or greater temblor within a 62-mile radius of the 2014 La Habra earthquake by 2018. On the outer rim of that big circle sit Riverside and San Bernardino counties.\nThe impact of such a quake in La Habra would be minimal on the Inland Empire, Graves said. It would be felt, “but I would be surprised if there was a major effect,” he said.\n“It’s important not to read too much into this 60-mile circle. There is nothing special about that,” he said. “It’s an arbitrary choice made by these researchers.”\nThe NASA-led study – published earlier this month in the American Geophysical Union journal Earth and Space Science and publicized this week – asserts there is enough stored seismic energy in the network of faults linked to the La Habra quake to generate a quake of magnitude 6.1 to 6.3.\nThe research simply affirms the basic conclusion that Southern California is primed for a big earthquake. The tools developed over the past decade by USGS and others have forecast an 85 percent probability that a magnitude 5 or better will happen in that same area and along the same time frame.\nDespite criticism of the report, no one, from NASA to USGS to local leaders, believes that Inland residents should be any less prepared for “the Big One.”\nRiverside County officials are keenly aware of the NASA study, and it hasn’t changed how the county is preparing one way or another, said Kim Saruwatari, director of the county’s emergency management department.\n“I think that at the end of the day, whether it’s the 85 percent number or the 99.9 percent number, the message for emergency management is that we need to maintain a constant state of readiness,” she said, “and understand that earthquakes can happen at any time.”\nReadiness for Saruwatari means constant assessment of the county’s emergency response procedures and spreading the gospel of readiness to residents.\nOn Oct. 15, that included participating in the Great California ShakeOut drill. Just over 620,000 residents and workers in Riverside County and 668,000 in San Bernardino County registered to participate, according to the event’s website.\n“Readiness is important no matter what percentage or probability,” echoed Craig Petinak, spokesman for the Riverside County Office of Education. “That is why we encourage schools to participate … increase the readiness in case something does happen.”\nGraves doubts there will be a way to truly predict an earthquake in his lifetime. Preparedness, he said, is paramount.\n“I wake up each day recognizing that we can have a large earthquake. It’s a fact of living in Southern California.”\nContact the writer: rmbrown@pe.com or Twitter: @RichardBrown_PE", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwpohf-b88547734z.120151023232253000goaco5fs.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwpohg-b88547734z.120151023232253000ghdco47c.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwpohf-b88547734z.120151023232253000goaco5et.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwpohf-b88547734z.120151023232253000goaco5et.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwpohf-b88547734z.120151023232253000goaco5fs.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwpohg-b88547734z.120151023232253000ghdco47c.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:04:22.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
