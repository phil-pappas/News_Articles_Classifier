Djansezian/Getty Images Rap mogul Jay Z is seen last week arriving to a Los Angeles courtroom after being accused of violating the copyright to Egyptian composer Baligh Hamdi's 1957 song \"Khosara Khosara.\" \nJay Z is off the hook. \nA copyright infringement case against the hip-hop mogul's 1999 hit \"Big Pimpin'” has been tossed by a judge before the case was sent to a jury. \nA U.S. District judge's decision Wednesday comes eight years after the heir of an Egyptian composer accused the multi-Grammy award winner of ripping off one of his late uncle's songs. \nFlute notes from Baligh Hamdi's 1957 song \"Khosara Khosara\" appear throughout the rapper’s song. \nJudge Christina A. Snyder ruled that Hamdi's nephew didn't have the right to pursue a copyright infringement claim and the case should be tossed out. \nAttorneys for the Brooklyn superstar, born Shawn Carter, and producer Timbaland, argued that they secured the necessary contract approvals to use the song. \nIn 2001, Timbaland paid $100,000 to settle a claim against its use. \nWith News Wire Services", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T21:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:57:53.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
