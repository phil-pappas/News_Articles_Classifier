But he has since appeared on \"The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon\" and agreed to several interviews with NBC News programs. \nHis return to 30 Rockefeller Center for \"SNL\" is sure to garner even more attention. \nTrump has hosted \"SNL\" once before, on April 3, 2004. \nTrump will be live from New York alongside musical guest Sia. \nLast month Trump suggested that he was in talks with NBC about a surprise appearance. \nDuring an interview with CNN, host Alisyn Camerota asked, \"has 'SNL' asked you to go on this season? Would you consider it?\" \nTrump answered cryptically: \"I'm not allowed to say that.\" \nShe pressed: \"Because... you're in negotiations with them?\" And he said: \"I'm just not allowed to say it. I mean, I have-- uh-- silencio. I can't speak about it.\" \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource . All rights reserved.
