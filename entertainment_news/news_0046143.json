Mr. Solomon is no joke and for his first evil task, he steals a baby. Seriously. \nWhile Mr. Solomon is running around terrifying moms and intimidating Keen's enemies, things move along rather quickly as Liz and Reddington lose their hiding place at the bar and steal a Porsche as a getaway for very practical reason: No one would look for fugitives in a flashy car (sure, OK). \nAs they run, Reddington decides to drop by to see \"The Troll Farmer.\" \nYes, you read right, \"The Troll Farmer\" (Meng Ai), a young computer genius who creates diversions through social media to confuse the feds with fake photos and tips from \"citizens\" who want to help find Keen and Reggington. \nThe Troll Farmer's team goes as far as to find lookalikes for the ex agents on the run (to create realistic images of the two) forcing Liz Keen to experience an awkward conversation with her \"lookalike\" who acts like she´s meeting a member of the Mickey Mouse Club. \nThe Troll Farmer is very upset by Keen and Reddington's presence as his deadline to mask the agents' whereabouts went from one week to down to an hour. The Troll Farmer and his team manage to mix the FBI up enough with fake tips and photos of the fugitive agents that Keen and Reddington make a break for it into separate vans, hoping to get through heavy police DC check points. \nRessler is running around like a chicken with his head cut off, chasing fake leads, but the super-smart computer hacker, FBI agent Aram Mojtabai (Amir Arison) is somehow able to weed through the diversions and get super close to finding Liz. \nReddington, understanding the dire problem finds a way to call Ressler on a cell phone and gives up the location of The Troll Farmer in exchange for Ressler's genuine benefit of the doubt, meaning all Reddington asks is for Ressler to emotionally crack a little and believe Keen is innocent, even though he had no real proof of it. Ressler takes Reddington's deal and takes note of The Troll Farmer's address \nKeen finds herself on her own for the first time and is scared out of her mind, but in the spirit of her Russian spy mom, she thinks on her feet. \nBy the end of the show, we find Liz running about six feet ahead of her former partner, Ressler, and just as they are about the grab her, she jumps a fence to the Russian embassy and screams that she's an agent for Russia and seeks asylum. \nSuper drama. Hope Liz makes it out alive ... if she didn't there wouldn't be much of a series, but one can only assume such an outcome from this interesting, if not outright exciting, season premiere.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T18:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:36:41.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
