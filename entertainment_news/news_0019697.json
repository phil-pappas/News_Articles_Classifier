A Stanford University graduate with a BS degree in Management Science and Engineering, JR was signed as a running back to the Oakland Raiders subsequent to finishing school. After being released from the Raiders, JR relocated to southern California with the intention of continuing his football training. Little did he know at the time, but the move would expose JR to possibilities of a life he had never imagined in the entertainment industry.\nWhile appearing in numerous national commercial and print campaigns JR honed his craft with the intention of pursuing an acting career. The hard work paid off when he booked a series regular role in NBC’s medical drama The Night Shift, which was recently renewed for a third season. He recently also made his big screen debut as one of the male leads in Tyler Perry’s A Madea Christmas – the next installment in Lionsgate’s successful franchise.\nIn order to satisfy his football interest, JR still performs much of the Motion Capture for Electronics Artists on their extremely popular football video game, Madden.\n“Saturday Mornings with Joy Keys” is an interactive, live Internet talk-radio show that focuses on providing people with tools to enrich and advance their lives mentally, physically and emotionally.
