Yellow Springs artist Sharri Phillips makes the most of her deep sleep sojourns by creating art.\n“Exploration of Dreams and Memories” will be held at the Yellow Springs Arts Council gallery, 111 Corry St. The opening coincides with the traditional third Friday Yellow Springs Art Stroll.\n“I am very drawn towards whimsical and magical themes,” Phillips said.\nShe has vibrant dreams of carnivals, gypsies, fairies and whirling dancers. Working with fabric, paint and paper mache, Phillips creates enchanting mixed-media paintings. Themes include childhood memories of summers spent at amusement parks and boardwalks of Atlantic City. The show represents works from the past 10 years, including representational and abstract quilts. Bold colors and patterns tell evocative stories with scenes of carousels, Russian nesting dolls and belly dancers.\n“I often find inspiration in fantasy books, movies and art and try to create a certain sense of wonder and brightness in my work,” Phillips said. “Some of the newer pieces in the show are three-dimensional paintings and a paper mache fairy treehouse.”\nPhillips’ opening reception is on the first evening of the Yellow Springs Art Stroll, Friday, Oct. 16, at the YSAC Art Gallery, 111 Corry St.\n“On Oct. 16 come stroll through Yellow Springs, step into the magical world of Sharri and then meander on,” said Nancy Mellon, artist and director of the YSAC gallery. “There are other delightful receptions that will be going on around the village and more artists waiting to greet you with smiles, art, and refreshments.”\nAmong them are shows by Debbie Loffing at Would You, Could You, In a Frame and Ann Bain at Village Artisans. Loffing presents “A Cast of Characters,” mixed-media assemblages that she creates in her Mad River Mud Pottery studio in Urbana.\n“Debbie creates fun, delightful characters from found objects like old faucet handles, teapots, and gears found in junkyards,” said 20-year gallery proprietor Sherryl Kostic.\nAt Village Artisans, Bain will be presenting a show titled “smallWORKS.” A reception will be held from 6:30 to 9 p.m., Friday, October 16, at the gallery, at 100 Corry St.\n“Sometimes inspiration comes on tiny feet instead of humungous, stomping ones … listen to the small,” Bain said.\nOther exhibits include a show of Western art at the Glen House Inn that bills itself as an “Italianate villa dedicated to art.” Jim Tetz will be showing “Landscapes of the American West: A Large Format Photography Exhibit.” The show will be up through Oct. 25.\n“A beautiful scene of nature, for me, is a fleeting feeling of heaven and earth; a transparent glimpse of the transcendent,” stated Tetz, who lives just outside of Yellow Springs.\nMore about Glen House exhibits can be found at www.glenhouseart.com. Other shows are “Images in Glass” by Karen Hammond at the Chris K Gallery, Paula Womacks’ “Works in Oil” at the Yellow Springs Brewery and “The Yellow Springs Textile Art Group” at The Winds Cafe.\n“It’s a great night. You’ll be able to pop from gallery to gallery and place to place,” Kostic said. “And most sites will be exhibiting art that night. It’s a fun evening of discovering unique art and eating delicious foods.”\nContact contributing writer Pamela Dillon at pamdillon@woh.rr.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:20:22.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
