Beyond that, they generally shrug their shoulders, as if to say, “Whoever he was, he is long gone and he has nothing to do with me.” And that is when I lavish praise on Andrea Wulf’s new book, The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt’s New World .\nThe gist of my praise is simple. Wulf recognized not only a good story but also an important one. She has written a fascinating book about a fascinating man whose work influences our thinking even though his name is no longer widely remembered.\nIn his youth, Humboldt worked as a mining engineer, but only until he acquired the means to explore the world he loved, the world of plants and insects and geography. In 1799, he began an epic journey through South America. He delighted in bird-eating spiders and 30-foot-long snakes. He brought details and corrections to maps. He climbed mountains. He traveled on the Orinoco River. After many adventures, after collecting many samples, he returned home and commenced a long period of lecturing and writing, of sharing not only his experiences but also his ideas.\nIn Europe he lived modestly, spending his limited funds on exploration and science. Ignoring his own financial needs, he supported those with similar interests but even less means. He worked long hours. He spoke frenetically not only during lectures but at parties. Everyone wanted to read his books. Everyone wanted to know him.\nWulf’s title, The Invention of Nature , is not, of course, to be taken literally. Humboldt did not invent nature. He merely invented our image of nature, a way of thinking about the world that blends objective science with subjective impressions. He did so with charm and wit, with irrepressible energy and with a prolific pen that influenced the likes of Charles Darwin, Henry David Thoreau and John Muir.\nIn his lifetime, Humboldt was as renowned as, say, Mick Jagger or Michael Jordan. He wrote for specialists and nonspecialists. His work was known and Quote: d by the erudite elite and by farmers and fishermen. He was wined and dined by Thomas Jefferson and supported by Czar Nicholas. He answered more than 50,000 letters. His birthday was once celebrated by parades in Europe and America. Cincinnati had Humboldt Street, and Boston had Humboldt Avenue.\nWhen he died at 89 in 1835, over 10,000 mourners followed his funeral procession through Berlin. Even in America, writes Wulf, people felt fortunate “to have lived in what they now called the ‘Age of Humboldt.’”\nSo what happened? If Humboldt was truly so influential, why has he been all but forgotten? Wulf suggests that Humboldt’s mixing of science with poetry, art and history may not have served him well in a world that increasingly valued specialization. “By the beginning of the 20th century,” Wulf writes, “there was little room for a man whose knowledge had bridged a vast range of subjects.”\nShe suggests, too, that he suffered from his Prussian nationality. By birthright, he was with the bad guys in two world wars. “Both world wars of the 20th century,” writes Wulf, “cast long shadows, and neither Britain nor America were places for the celebration of a great German mind.” Humboldt — never quick to support his nation’s political and military objectives but still a Prussian — was snubbed, guilty by association.\nWhile his name may be forgotten, his ideas march on. “Humboldt’s disciples,” writes Wulf, “and their disciples in turn, carried his legacy forward — quietly, subtly and sometimes unintentionally.” Today, the influence of this forgotten man permeates the public mind, guiding an environmental movement that cannot and should not see nature as mere facts and figures.\nHumboldt is, Wulf suggests, “the founding father” of environmentalism. It is this long-dead man who articulated a passion for nature that relies on observations of the real world but that goes beyond the cold realm of hard data. It is Humboldt who made room for entirely respectable biologists and hydrologists and geologists to recognize and internalize the beauty and magic of the world they study.\nHistory, as it often does, has veiled an important aspect of our past. To understand ourselves, we must understand what drives our thoughts. We all carry with us a worldview, a way of perceiving our experiences. As often as not, we have no clear knowledge of the origin of that worldview. For environmentalists — for those making a living protecting the natural world and those who sport Sierra Club bumper stickers or Nature Conservancy T-shirts — Wulf’s book is about a long-dead great man but also about ourselves.\nBill Streever is the author of Cold and Heat. His next book, about wind, will be published in 2016.\nThe Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt’s New World Andrea Wulf (Knopf, $30)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T01:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:00:14.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
