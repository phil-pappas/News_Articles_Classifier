Seal was assassinated in 1986 at a Louisiana safe house by Colombian hitmen.\nUniversal bought the rights to his life story from his third wife and children from that marriage for $350,000, according to the Louisiana Advocate .\nBut Lisa Seal Frigon, Seal’s daughter from his first marriage, contends in her lawsuit against Universal and the family members that the studio made a deal with the wrong next of kin.\nFrigon claims that Seal’s “life story rights” are the property of his estate. As the executor of her father’s estate, she said her consent was required to make a film based on Seal's life.\nAs part of her suit, Frigon is seeking an injunction against the film’s scheduled 2017 release. A rep for the studio didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment on the lawsuit.\n“Mena,” which is filming in Colombia, was rocked by tragedy last month after a small plane assigned to the film’s crew crashed. Two people, including the pilot, were killed, and a third was seriously injured.\nRelated Stories Why Tom Cruise wasn't at daughter Bella's wedding Paramount aims for a ‘Mission: Impossible 6' Tags: tom cruise", "external_links": ["http://theadvocate.com/news/13713328-55/daughter-of-slain-drug-smuggler"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:40:28.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
