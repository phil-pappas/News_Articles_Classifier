Just live for today.\"\nSuch a self-absorbed lifestyle choice was probably as all the rage in Huxley's between-the-wars world as it is today. All dressed up in space-age wigs, video projections resembling a Brian Eno installation and a stentorian electronic soundscape care of pop panoramicists These New Puritans, James Dacre's production for the Royal and Derngate, Northampton and The Touring Consortium renders the story as an all too recognisable prophecy.\nShare article It opens as a lecture, with the audience the new trainers being given a guided tour around a hatchery centre where test tube babies are sired in a social caste system that seemingly seals their fate for a half-life of feels-free kicks. This sets a tone of dispassionate ice-cool ennui only broken when Grufford Glyn's Bernard goes in a not so hot date to the badlands with Olivia Morgan's Lenina. Here they stumble in William Postlethwaite's John The Savage, a Shakespeare-quoting but of rough who becomes a messiah-like cause célèbre, inspiring random outbreaks of sex, violence and poetry before running off to the wilderness with Lenina.\nWatching over all this is the World State Controller, Mond, played by Sophie Ward as a gimlet-eyed social engineer who calls the shots. The production is a slickly realised if bleakly desolate affair that suggests people power has already been tranquilised into submission.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-01T07:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T20:26:49.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
