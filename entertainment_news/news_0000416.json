He also apologized for using the N-word from the stage at the comedy club during an appearance on The Late Show with David Letterman, and now he insists the incident from almost a decade ago is behind him: \"It is what it is! I've moved on.\" \nBut the drama made him realize he's not cut out for stand-up comedy. \n\"I never had a great knack for that,\" he adds. \"I was always more of a performance artist, in a sense, and that could be misunderstood, given what happened nine years ago. I am sorry for all that. \n\"Jerry (Seinfeld) is a definitive stand-up and that's his deal. He's really good at it.\" Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T23:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:23:07.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
