The Australian spent four and a half years on a forensic cold-case investigation of JFK’s assassination and believes he has confirmed the source of the shot that killed the president. After reading Bonar Menninger’s \"Mortal Error: The Shot That Killed JFK\" which details the 25 years of painstaking work done by ballistics expert Howard Donahue, McLaren committed himself to digging even deeper into the case with the discipline of his crime scene investigation experience. McLaren’s investigation marks the first and only time a qualified homicide detective has carefully analyzed the complete catalog of evidence, testimony and witness statements surrounding the JFK assassination using modern techniques and the most recently released information. Using state-of-the-art investigative tools and research methodologies, McLaren answers what is perhaps the most asked question of the last 50 years—who killed JFK? For those interested in going deeper into the books behind the story, \"JFK: The Smoking Gun\" and \"Mortal Error: The Shot That Killed JFK\", are available to buy through links featured at http://www.reelz.com/smokinggun/get-the-books/ . \"JFK: The Smoking Gun\" is produced by Muse Entertainment and Cordell/Jigsaw/Zapruder.\nAdditional chance to watch \"JFK: The Smoking Gun\" on Tuesday, November 10 at 7pm ET/ 4pm PT.\n\"Jackie: Behind Closed Doors\" – Premieres Saturday, November 7 at 9pm ET/ 6pm PT\nHosted by Natalie Morales of NBC News’ TODAY and produced by NBC News’ Peacock Productions, the special will explore the life and legacy of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis. \"Jackie: Behind Closed Doors\" examines the story of a young woman, celebrated as a beautiful and stylish political wife. Later, as a young widow, she led a grieving nation and was widely praised for her grace and composure. But what was behind that dazzling smile? This is the portrait of Jackie that, until now, has remained behind closed doors.\nCapitalizing on the vast offerings of the NBC News historical archives, the documentary will feature interviews with historians, biographers and contemporaries of the former first lady—as well as her own interviews—to tell this uniquely American story of success, heartache, survival and reinvention while sharing new revelations that will uncover previously unknown facts and insights into her life. As Jackie herself said: “Maybe I’m just dazzled and picture myself in a glittering world of crowned heads and Men of Destiny and not just a sad little housewife...That world can be very glamorous from the outside but if you’re in it and you’re lonely it could be a hell.” \"Jackie: Behind Closed Doors\" is produced by Peacock Productions, a division of NBC News.\n\"The Kennedy Files\" - Premieres Tuesday, November 10 at 9pm ET/ 6pm PT\nThe Kennedy family’s incredible journey through the corridors of power in Washington, Wall Street and Hollywood is one with great triumphs and glamour but one also layered with human frailty, folly and tragedy.
