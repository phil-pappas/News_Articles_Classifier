Sanchez / Chicago Tribune) Chris Jones Contact Reporter Did Broadway save a bankrupt New York? A case is made in the new book \"Razzle Dazzle.\" So what about Chicago? \nDid Broadway save a bankrupt city of New York? Such a case is credibly made by New York Post columnist Michael Riedel in his fascinating new book, \"Razzle Dazzle,\" published this week by Simon & Schuster. Riedel focuses in on the year 1975 when the city's credit rating sunk after the discovery of a huge (and previously obscured) deficit. By that October, Riedel reports, New York had $34 million in the bank and $477 million in obligations to cover. Sanitation workers were on strike; garbage was strewn in streets widely seen as unsafe; furious firefighters may or may not have been on call. \nIf you were to look at the economic history of New York City, 1975 was the bottom. A city that thought itself the greatest metropolis on earth had to go cap in hand to the federal government. \nThese days, it is not uncommon for a nice condo in a decent building with park views to go for more money than the entire city of New York had on hand in 1975. Tourists from Shanghai and St. Louis frolic in Hampton Inns built on the site of former sex shops and massage parlors on Eighth Avenue. Disney enterprises have replaced the hookers on 42nd Street. \nSo what happened? \nWell, it's complicated but, in essence, people came back to the cities and to New York in particular, both residents and tourists. Investment returned. \nMuch credit typically goes to mayors like Ed Koch and Rudy Giuliani, who cleaned up vice districts, pushed out undesirables and clamped down on nuisance crimes. Once the infrastructure was functioning and crime reduced, the argument usually goes, the natural asset of a great city, the draw of its history, the life-affirming force of its romance, its prestige and its pull, could all be trusted to work their magic. The politicians just had to make it possible for New York to be New York. (Chris Jones) \nBut Riedel argues that it was actually the theater and restaurant owners — people sick of plying their struggling trade in an environment that was collapsing all around them — who did the real work on the ground that transformed the fortunes of New York. The offices of Gotham City chugged along; people could head home right after work. But you can't run an entertainment or dinner business if the police are telling people to get off the streets by 6 p.m. \nSo, in Riedel's telling, the late Gerald Schoenfeld of the Shubert Organization went to work, back there in the mid-1970s. He harassed cops on the take to do their jobs and arrest the pimps and prostitutes; he organized all of the businesses in and around Times Square so that they had a collective voice; he found private cash to fill the potholes and empty the garbage cans that the city was leaving full; he waged war against corruption and vice. Retail-style. \nWith some well-chosen allies, he went about this mission block by block, nasty business by nasty business, sometimes resorting to unsavory, hardball tactics. This was controversial at the time — streetwalkers had rights — but Schoenfeld and his pals also were confronting a massive sex business with documented ties to the mafia — a sex business that dominated the very streets where kids now go to see \"Aladdin.\" Schoenfeld's contribution was not least his figuring out that the one had to go before the other could arrive. Ergo, the circle of life. Chicago Theatre District Chicago Tribune \nThe Oriental Theatre on Randolph is run by Broadway in Chicago and is a cornerstone of the Chicago Theatre District in the Loop. \nThe Oriental Theatre on Randolph is run by Broadway in Chicago and is a cornerstone of the Chicago Theatre District in the Loop. (Chicago Tribune) \nBy 1978, New York was recovering and had come up with its famous \"I Love New York\" tourist campaign; \"A Chorus Line\" was making headlines all over the world and reigniting the phenomenon of the long-running, brand-name, must-see show. Broadway, which grossed $1.37 billion during the 2014-15 season, never looked back. Nor did New York. See how much a hotel room there is this weekend? \nAre there lessons here for Chicago? \nSure there are. But it's worth noting first that what one urban reformer sees as an improvement, another sees as the destruction of an indigenous culture. Riedel barely notes this issue, since the theater owners are the heroes of his story, but if you walk through Times Square today, as I frequently do, it has lost much of its character. Dive bars in Midtown are few. Chain stores prevail. Instead of trumpeting a thousand small businesses, the famous plaza's overwhelmingly scaled digital screens make you feel like you are walking through a public space that has been sold off, suburbanized and sanitized. It is hard to construct a case that prostitution on 42nd Street was good for anybody, but you'll find plenty of New Yorkers who claim to prefer sharing the sidewalk with sex workers over walking through the door of the 42nd Street Applebee's. The most depressing aspect of this renaissance is recent — the sense that Times Square is the marketplace of the few, now and forever. Stare at the screen that now covers the New York Marriott hotel and you can imagine a future where there only is room for one, massive presence, drowning out the little guys. \nStill, this case can be overstated and sentimentalized. Times Square has resisted some prior takeovers. So what about Chicago? \nThere are similarities. For one thing, the commercial Loop theaters are mostly New York-owned. James L. Nederlander, the scion of James M. Nederlander of the Broadway Nederlanders, controls, through various entities, the company called Broadway in Chicago, which operates the Oriental, Cadillac Palace and Bank of America theaters, along with the Broadway Playhouse near Water Tower Place. The Chicago Theatre is owned by Madison Square Garden Entertainment. The Auditorium Theatre is controlled by Roosevelt University — which fought long and hard for that privilege — but it has a non-compete deal with Broadway in Chicago. In other words, these are much the same players. And the Nederlanders are no shrinking violets. \nThere are two notable differences. One is that the number of downtown venues for theater, comedy and music is far fewer in Chicago. That's mostly because Chicago knocked down many of those historic venues, some right around when Schoenfeld was out cleaning up Midtown. Chicago has built a couple of new ones — such as the Harris Theater and the Pritzker Pavilion in Millennium Park, as well as the nonprofit Goodman Theatre, but still. The theater district does not gross $1.37 billion a season. Unless there is a colossal building boom, with the requisite increase in demand, which means the requisite increase in international tourism, it would not be physically possible. I'd argue many of those wrecking balls were a mistake. They swung at New York, too, and made some hits. But they also were much better resisted. \nThe other difference is complicated. One certainly could extrapolate some similarities between New York in 1975 and today — the current Chicago financial crisis, say, or publicity about crime in the city depressing the potential of international tourism. But the epicenter of today's gun violence problem is not on the nighttime streets around these cultural businesses, as was the case in New York in 1975. In Chicago, the high-crime ZIP codes are distant, and, therefore, those doing business in the Loop do not have so direct an incentive to do something about it. \nNaturally, any business in Chicago dependent on tourism has an incentive to join our politicians to decrease gun violence. If you care about a city, the location of Chicagoans dying should not matter a jot. Nor should the nature of your business interest — or if you have any such interest. It should be a human obligation. \nBut Riedel's book points out the raw power of proximity and self-interest. That's what got the job done in New York. \nIn Chicago, those promoting the city have been focusing more on changing the message away from the news reports. Understandably so. But in New York, the guy running the theaters went out and banged heads. He did not have far to go. They were his neighbors. Their heads conveniently presented themselves. \nAnd why were the food and entertainment industries so unusually central in all of this? \nThe answer is simple. They were local businesses and did their business at night . And more crime happens at night. The proximity wasn't just geographic — it was also chronological. \nThe theater owners took longer to organize in Chicago, as the live entertainment business has historically been more fractured here. Still, there's no question that Nederlander, in particular, understands that his business in Chicago rises and falls with the city — many of the people who work for him work as hard on the business of the city as on the business of their business. Except, of course, they are really one and the same. \nIn 1975, that penny dropped in the minds of the people who ran Broadway. It sometimes takes us a bit longer in Chicago. \nChris Jones is a Tribune critic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:18:04.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
