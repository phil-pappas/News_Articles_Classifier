Jem and the Holograms became one of the worst debuts of all time for a major studio movie opening in over 2,000 locations with a truly outrageous $1.3 million. Bill Murray's Rock the Kasbah barely did better, pulling in only $1.5 million. Vin Diesel's The Last Witch Hunter also tanked with $10.8 million. But, while poor reviews might have sunk Jem and Kasbah, good reviews couldn't save Steve Jobs either. After two very strong limited-release weekends, the biopic failed to impress in wide release with $7.3 million; USA Today notes that that's only slightly ahead of Ashton Kutcher flop Jobs' $6.7 million debut two years ago. The weekend of duds left room for holdovers to reclaim the top spots: In second place, Goosebumps earned $15.5 million, while The Martian reclaimed its throne in weekend four with $15.9 million. Michael Fassbender stars as Steve Jobs in a scene from the film, \"Steve Jobs.\" (Universal Pictures via AP) ADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T18:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:37:27.941+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
