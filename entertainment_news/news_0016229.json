And his achievements are not only limited to acting. Recently, the National Award-winning actor was honoured with the 'Certificate of Recognition' by the California Legislature Assembly for his contribution towards supporting the community of displaced people from the valley of Kashmir. He was also named the UN ambassador of the 'HeForShe' campaign for gender equality. The actor, who was in town to showcase the play Mera Woh Matlab Nahi Tha as part of the Times of India theatre festival, says, \"I feel triumphant and feel like a proud Indian to be rewarded for the cause of human rights and welfare.\" In appreciation of his contribution towards cinema and global arts, Las Vegas had declared September 10 'Anupam Kher Day'. When asked about how he feels about taking the stage in Bengaluru, Anupam replies, \"I am overwhelmed to see how art lovers of Bengaluru respond to this piece of theatrical. Tickets for the show were sold out instantly. It's a good feeling to have so many people appreciating your work.\" There was an additional show of the play staged during the fest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T11:56:19.766+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
