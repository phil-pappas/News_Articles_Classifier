It co-stars Sydney Theatre Company stalwart Chris Ryan and includes songs by Amanda Palmer, Kate Miller-Heidke and Megan Washington.\nOther highlights of the festival, which celebrates its 40th anniversary next year and begins on January 7, include The Flaming Lips headlining the free annual Summer Sounds In The Domain concert on January 9 and the Kate Miller-Heidke composed, Lally Katz-penned opera The Rabbits, based on the book by John Marsden and Shaun Tan, at Roslyn Packer Theatre from January 14-24.\nThe Parramatta instalment of Sydney Festival continues in 2016, albeit without the opening night party.\nAt the heart of it will be the free fairground with a difference, the Arquitectura de Feria, which will set up in Prince Alfred Square and features a range of rides using recycled materials including a hand-cranked ferris wheel using toilets as seats and a bicycle-powered carousel.\n The Square will also see the large-scale installation 1000 Bells take shape over the festival period, as 1000 ceramic bells are made on-site with workshops to help everyone get involved.\nRiverside Theatres will host a range of acts, including the circus show La Verita, which hails from Switzerland and was inspired by a recently discovered work by Salvador Dali, painted on a curtain in the 1940s and used as a backdrop to this show, from January 8-17.\nSydney Festival, January 7-26, 2016; multipack tickets on sale today from 9am, single tickets on sale from October 26, 9am; 1300 856 876, sydneyfestival.org.au", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/d00cbd0cd81a9bf4c7f4da66c8911277", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c72bc460f0cb926fdddb1241a7e85f4a", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/d013b61afa3dd07df6c3fffecc4c4f85", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/2b34476e9bf985edaf43a927b79979b7", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/77dfd1e8a93bbb19c1bf6c765c006342", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/879fe04d7025a96b1806c04473ea5f29", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-10-21T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:00:41.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
