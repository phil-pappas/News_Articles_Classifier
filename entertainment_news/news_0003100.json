Told in a similar fashion to The Office, the film follows Brent as he travels England and tries to relaunch his career as a musician.\nGervais has been working on the songs for the film for almost a year now, with Coldplay's Chris Martin contributing to the soundtrack in some fashion.\nEXCLUSIVE: First Look at #LifeOnTheRoad .

Look, it's great that Gervais is going back to The Office as it's a classic. The fact, however, that he's deciding to go it alone and without Stephen Merchant is a little bit worrying. The dynamic between the two is what made The Office work.\nIt's not that he's any worse or better without Merchant, but it's definitely a vital component in his writing and not having that is taking a risk. It's understood that no other members of The Office will appear in the documentary, although it's entirely possible we might see a sneaky cameo here and there.\nA release date is scheduled for August 2016 and, hopefully, we'll have a trailer pretty shortly.\nVia Twitter\nMORE: Ten movies you need to see before the end of 2015\nMORE: Marvel says Avengers: Infinity War will be the end of 'The Avengers as we know them'\nMORE: Daniel Craig says he's NOT done with James Bond just yet", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/LadyGypsy?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/rickygervais/status/656432698160979969", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/LifeOnTheRoad?src=hash", "http://twitter.com/rickygervais", "https://t.co/88nhbI7HX1"], "published": "2015-10-20T23:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:34:50.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
