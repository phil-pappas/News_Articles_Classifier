Torre , October 17th, 2015 01:32 AM SANTOS. “Ambidextrous” political connections. \nIn most countries, when a show biz star enters politics, it’s big news, like the furor over Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger’s successful bids decades ago. \nIn our part of the political universe, however, it’s—ho-hum, so what else is old? Stars and politics, as well as stars married to political VIPs, make for not so strange bedfellows—so, if the bedroom slippers fit, snuggle up and join the fun! \nThese thoughts come to mind at this time, because politically connected stars are currently making personal appearances at the Comelec for the filing of their or their life partners’ certificates of candidacy for next year’s polls. ADVERTISEMENT \nOne of them, Kiko Pangilinan’s wife, Sharon Cuneta, isn’t just a big star in her own right, but is also the niece of veteran actress and singer Helen Gamboa—who in turn is the wife of reelectionist Sen. Tito Sotto. Sharon is also the daughter of the iconic politico, Pablo Cuneta—so, she’s complicatedly connected to the show biz-politics syndrome in multiple ways, both coming and going! \nTo further complicate the picture, her daughter, KC, is a star in her own right—and Sharon’s hubby is a scion of the Pangilinan family, whose biz-related members and in-laws include Angeli, Anthony, Gary Valenciano—etc.! \nIn her own right \nFor his part, relectionist Sen. Ralph Recto has his superstar wife, Vilma Santos, who not so incidentally has become a political sensation in her own right, and was in fact being wooed by several parties to run for VP—and may herself end up running for congress. \nThe skein of other connections in their case includes Vilma’s son, star-host Luis Manzano, who is rumored to also be politics-bound—and the fact that Vilma’s ex, Edu Manzano, is running for senator himself! Talk about an “ambidextrous” political connections for Vilma, that’s it! \nLike Edu, lawyer Lorna Kapunan is running for senator on Grace Poe’s ticket. Her biz connections include her being many stars’ advocate of choice in resolving their multiple legal tussles, to such a well-publicized extent that Kapunan has become more nationally known than ever—a must for prospective “senatoriables” like herself. \nFact is, however, Kapunan has much more than just her links to top luminaries going for her, because she’s also valued by her corporate clients, and is a staunch advocate of the key importance of arts and culture to our nation. \nOther stars and starlets in politics include Alfred Vargas, Alma Moreno, Roderick Paulate, Lou Veloso, Joseph Estrada and his progeny, Herbert Bautista, Isko Moreno, Dan Fernandez, Lucy Torres-Gomez, Angelica Jones, Roselle Nava, Manny Pacquiao, Imelda Papin, Grace Poe, Lani Mercado, Anjo Yllana—etc.!
