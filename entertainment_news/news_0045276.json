Sponsored by AGM Board Chair, Robert Tattersall and the Community Foundation of Mississauga, the popular exhibition will run until the end of 2015 at the AGM’s Living Arts Centre location in Mississauga.\nCurated by the AGM’s own Kendra Ainsworth in partnership with Homer Watson House & Gallery, the exhibition combines works by Watson, with those of Jason Brown, Jennifer Carvahlo, April Hickox, Brian Jungen and Duane Linklater, Gavin Lynch, Reinhard Reitzenstein and Monica Tap.\nWatson is known as a founder of truthful representation in Canadian landscape painting. His honest representation of the Canadian wilderness was a departure from the romanticized style of English and European landscape painting so popular during his lifetime as a painter.\n“Contemporary Canadian artists looking at our landscape must also get to the ‘truth’ of their subject. One that is not only strongly represented in our national artistic history, but also one that is both deeply political and personal.” Explains Ainsworth, “Placing contemporary works by emerging and established artists alongside Watson’s speaks to our timeless quest to appreciate and capture the essence of the Canadian landscapes we live in.”\nA well-attended opening was held last Thursday with a private preview of Beyond The Pines for sponsors, AGM members, gallerists, contributing artists and fine art media. Initial reviews are excellent and attendance levels are high.\n###\nFor more information, please visit our web site , or contact us directly:\nMandy Salter\nDirector\n(905) 896 5507\nmandy(dot)salter(at)mississauga(dot)ca\nThe Art Gallery of Mississauga (AGM) is a public, not-for-profit, art gallery generously sponsored by the City of Mississauga, the Ontario Arts Council, the Canada Council for the Arts, the Ontario Trillium Foundation, private citizens and AGM members.
