Laney is a mother of two, and the wife of a loving if increasingly distant husband (Josh Charles). She’s also a multidirectional addict, whose life unravels in director Adam Salky’s debut. \"I Smile Back\" opens commercially Oct. 30; Silverman will appear Friday at the Chicago International Film Festival screening. \n6 p.m. Fri., AMC River East 21, 322 E. Illinois St. Tickets $17-$20 at chicagofilmfestival.com . Running time: 1:25. \n-- Michael Phillips", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T14:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:16:04.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
