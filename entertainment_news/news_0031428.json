Photo: Luis Enrique Ascui \nA huge inflatable tamarind monkey by acclaimed Melbourne artist Lisa Roet is among the projects to win funding in the City of Melbourne's annual arts grants.\nThe seven-metre high Golden Monkey  will cling from a column at the front of the Melbourne Town Hall as part of the city's Year of the Monkey celebrations for the Chinese lunar new year. The $20,000 grant facilitates Roet's long-standing focus on primates and her part in an ongoing research project into endangered species. \n\"It's something I've been waiting about 10 years for,\" she said of the Year of the Monkey timing. A companion tamarind monkey will also be installed in Beijing.\nRoet, a past winner of the McClelland Sculpture Survey & Award, has work in numerous galleries including the National Gallery of Victoria and National Gallery of Australia, in Canberra. In 2014's White Night Melbourne, her multimedia piece Monkey Heart  merged her heartbeat with that of a gorilla's and incorporated footage from her own heart valve surgery into a projection at the Forum Theatre.\nAdvertisement Other projects to receive grants from the City of Melbourne include a publication marking the 40th anniversary of 3CR community radio, and a large installation by Melbourne artist and academic Elizabeth Gower in which the words (also the piece's title) he loves me he loves me not  appear 21,915 times across 10 film panels.\nApplications for this year's grants were up 72 per cent, prompting an additional $200,000 to go in to the $1 million funding pool, the council said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T07:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:46:48.390+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
