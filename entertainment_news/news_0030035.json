It weighs on you,\" Northwestern's redshirt freshman quarterback said Saturday.\n\"I was always looking to see where we have to improve. But we just stayed together and that was big. We came together Monday morning, and it was like, 'We're not letting this happen. We're not letting this go down this road.' We responded well.\"\nThe Wildcats (6-2, 2-2 Big Ten) responded with an exciting 30-28 victory over Nebraska before a crowd of 89,493 mostly red-clad and red-faced fans on a sunny, crisp afternoon at Memorial Stadium.\nIt has been a few weeks since Northwestern players and coaches have felt such exuberance. The Wildcats became bowl-eligible after making big plays on both sides of the ball.\n\"A big team win, a huge team win to get us over the hump and to get to six (wins) and get into the postseason,\" Northwestern coach Pat Fitzgerald said. \"But we just talked about it in the locker room. Six is not the destination. We didn't talk about it in camp — 'Let's get to six wins.'\"\nYet after back-to-back 5-7 stay-at-home seasons, the Wildcats are now able exhale entering an off weekend.\nCoach Pat Fitzgerald on NU's win over Nebraska Coach Pat Fitzgerald discusses Northwestern's goals for the rest of the seaosn.\nCoach Pat Fitzgerald discusses Northwestern's goals for the rest of the seaosn.\nSee more videos Meanwhile, hard-luck Nebraska (3-5, 1-3) has lost its five games by a total of 13 points. Four of the five matches between Northwestern and Nebraska since the Huskers joined the Big Ten have been decided by three or fewer points.\n\"That's a really disappointing game for us,\" first-year Nebraska coach Mike Riley said. \"All those things that we talked about and thought we were making some strides in some ways, like balance, run/pass ratio … all that stuff didn't look too good today. We gave up probably three or four big plays today.\"\nThe Cornhuskers controlled the time of possession 38 minutes, 58 seconds to 21:02. Yet it was the Wildcats who came up with the crucial plays at the right time, including Thorson runs of 68 and 49 yards to set up scores and cornerback Nick VanHoose's 72-yard pick-6.\n\"I was in Cover-2 and Anthony (Walker) took (Nebraska quarterback Tommy Armstrong) out of the pocket,\" VanHoose said. \"I saw that the running back came out to my side and I figured since Anthony was chasing (Armstrong) down, he was going to get rid of the ball. So I ran up and got it.\"\nThen he made a mad dash to the end zone to give Northwestern a 14-5 lead.\nAnd when Nebraska scored on Armstrong's 3-yard run with 4:23 left, the Wildcats defense denied a 2-point conversion pass attempt that would have tied the game.\n\"I'm really proud of the resilience. We didn't necessarily play great early,\" Fitzgerald said of his team's 17-12 halftime lead. \"We stuck together, found a way to make some plays in the first half and make it a game. And then in the second half, just some big, big plays.\"\nThorson completed 13 of 28 passes for 177 yards and one key 37-yard touchdown completion to Dan Vitale in the fourth quarter that gave Northwestern a 27-22 lead. But it was his running (126 yards, one touchdown) that kept the Nebraska defense on its heels.\n\"It was a lot of instinct,\" Thorson said of his unscripted runs. \"Our line was doing a good job, and there were a lot of holes on those pass plays. When things broke down, I just ran it. Obviously it was a good outcome.\"\nfmitchell@tribpub.com\nTwitter @kicker34\n2 minute drill\nSenior moments: Nick VanHoose, Dean Lowry, Drew Smith and Dan Vitale were among the several seniors who came up with big plays Saturday.\nTeam player: Justin Jackson has had limited carries the last three games, but the sophomore running back continues to be a threat and a focus of opposing defenses. Jackson rushed 14 times for 40 yards, but also caught two passes for 55.\nStanding tall: Lowry set a Northwestern record with his six tackles for loss to go along with his two sacks and 10 tackles. When the 6-foot-6, 290-pound defensive end stands out, he allows middle linebacker Anthony Walker (13 tackles) to make plays.\nDefense plan: Defensive coordinator Mike Hankwitz devised an effective plan to contain mobile quarterback Tommy Armstrong (24 of 48 for 291 yards, one touchdown, one interception), who was limited to 13 yards rushing on 12 runs.\nUp next: Penn State visits Ryan Field on Nov. 7.\n Northwestern Wildcats Nebraska Cornhuskers Michigan Wolverines Iowa Hawkeyes", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562bce1f/turbine/ct-northwestern-nebraska-photos-20151024", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562beb64/turbine/ct-colleges-northwestern-pat-fitzgerald-video-spt-20151024", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562bedd2/turbine/ct-northwestern-nebraska-football-spt-1025-20151024"], "published": "2015-10-25T01:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:55:46.320+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
