Relationships have those extremes. You can absolutely madly love the same person you want to kill,\" Jolie said.\n\"It's the puzzle of figuring out those things that get in the way of really loving someone. A lot of it's the past, a lot of it's insecurities, a lot of it's wanting something so much that you focus too much on losing it,\" Pitt, 51 added.\nWritten and directed by Jolie, 'By the Sea' is a romantic drama about a couple in the 1970s who are struggling to save their marriage.\nThe film also marks the couple's first project together after 'Mr and Mrs Smith,' that released in 2005.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T15:02:55.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
