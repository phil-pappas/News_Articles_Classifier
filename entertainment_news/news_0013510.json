Called “Spider with Wings,” the show is in conjunction with another exhibit, The Luna Project, displaying the work of a group of educators: Julie Agnew, Margery Ashwood, Viola DePass, Lucinda Blackstone, Ellen Finan, Cookie Smith, Deborah George, Jamie-Marie Olaiz-Parrish, Robin Reed Riggle and Julia Sanzberro.\nThrough sewing classes in middle school, Rinne, 61, and Schaafsma-Smith, 53, developed an early love for and appreciation of fabrics. Both studied painting and drawing.\nAfter Rinne took up quilting 35 years ago, she experimented with photo transfers onto fabric. She uses repurposed vintage material, laces and buttons in her collages, and emphasizes fiber and stitchery. She credits the women’s movement from the 1970s for transforming textile works from crafts to fine arts. The show’s title, “Spider with Wings,” is also the name of a book of poetry she’s written.\nIn her written artist’s statement, Rinne said she builds on ideas by dipping into different cultures, stitching memories into textile collages and exploring myths. “There is not always a plan when I begin,” she said. “I work on several pieces at once to allow ideas to percolate.”\nSchaafsma-Smith is an art teacher at Loma Vista Middle School in Riverside who started weaving last year. She’s always looking for new materials and methods to expand her story-telling skills through art. Her art-making techniques, she said in a phone interview are a critical way to keep her narratives interesting.\n“Spider with Wings” includes her newest felted textile experiments, monoprints and monoprint collages made from her woven pieces.\nContact the writer: llucas@pe.com , 951-368-9559", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwp4w6-b88546220z.120151023161905000gbgcn5gg.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwp4w4-b88546220z.120151023161905000gbgcn5g7.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwp4w7-b88546220z.120151023161905000gbgcn5g5.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwp4w6-b88546220z.120151023161905000gbgcn5ge.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwp4w5-b88546220z.120151023161905000gbgcn5g9.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwp4w5-b88546220z.120151023161905000gbgcn5gb.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwp4w5-b88546220z.120151023161905000gbgcn5g9.10.jpg", "http://www.rcaaarts.org/", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwp4w6-b88546220z.120151023161905000gbgcn5gg.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwp4w5-b88546220z.120151023161905000gbgcn5gb.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwp4w4-b88546220z.120151023161905000gbgcn5g7.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwp4w7-b88546220z.120151023161905000gbgcn5g5.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwp4w6-b88546220z.120151023161905000gbgcn5ge.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:34:08.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
