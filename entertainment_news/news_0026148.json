While Adam Levine, expressed his appreciation of the singer, his team was already full and he couldn’t accommodate anyone else.\nIn the end, Amy chose Pharell Williams as her coach for the ninth season of the American singing competition.\nThe “Happy” singer has picked American singer Missy Elliott to help him mentor Amy. “Our advice is always about you know, building connection and emphasizing what to feel for them. It is always how connection and eye contact are important,” Pharell said.\nMeanwhile, aside from TV viewers and online users, Amy also got the attention of “American Idol” Season 11’s champ Phillip Phillips, who sent her a tweet, saying, “How about a duet?”\nFor her part, Amy responded using her account, “How about we write one?”\nAs of this writing, Phillips hasn’t replied just yet.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:32:11.431+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
