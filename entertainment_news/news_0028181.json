They were petitioning the government for free tertiary education. But what started out as a peaceful protest turned nasty after President Jacob Zuma's announcement that university fees would rise by 0% in 2016.\nA group of agitators, possibly not even students, confronted police by a fence erected ahead of the protest, resulting in the police resorting to stun grenades, tear gas and eventually rubber bullets, and police in a nyala chased students on the south lawns of the Union Buildings and surrounding streets.\nCity Press' journalists Lerato Sejake , Xolani Mbanjwa and Poloko Tau were there.
