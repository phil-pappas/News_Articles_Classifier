Coca-Cola could have the upper hand in its battle with Pepsi to partner with Chobani yogurt — thanks to the fairy tale story of yogurt maker Hamdi Ulukaya, who was raised by semi-nomadic dairy farmers in Erzincan, Turkey.\nOn Monday night, Reuters reported that both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. were in negotiations to invest in Ulukaya’s $1.5 billion yogurt company. That deal could double Chobani’s worth, according to some reports.\nAccording to guests at last week’s American Turkish Society Honors gala — where Ulukaya was honored by A.T.S. chairman Murat Koprulu and Coca-Cola CEO Muhtar Kent — blood may prove thicker than sugar water in this business deal.\nAt that private gala, hosted by the Pierre Hotel, Kent presented Ulukaya with the American Turkish Society Honors philanthropy award for his $2-million donation to help refugees crossing the Turkish border. The 43-year-old farmer-turned-billionaire thanked the Coca-Cola exec for that honor and for helping him become the toast of the town.\nUlukaya told party guests that shortly after he started his company in upstate New York a decade ago, Kent called him out of the blue saying he’d been keeping an eye on his countryman’s then-small business and would like for them to stay in touch.\n“I will never forget that day,” Ulukaya told guests at the gala. According to Ulukaya, Kent said “If you ever need advice, here is my cell phone and give me a call… so I always reach out to him.”\nUlukaya also told guests it was Kent who introduced him to the Manhattan social scene, which for him, is still a work in progress.\n“One day he invited me to a great honor for him here in New York and I didn’t know until the last day that it was a black tie and I asked ‘what was black tie meant?’” he recalled. “I stood there laughing because I never did that in my life before.”\nUlukaya, a billionaire who still spends most of his time in New Berlin, N.Y., near his Chobani factory, called on his Turkish ties again last week when he was denied entry to a chi-chi members only club in Midtown, where he’d showed up in jeans for a coat-and-tie cocktail gathering the night before being honored by the American Turkish Society.\nUlukaya said Koprulu, who happened to be a member at that club, had him snuck in through a service entrance.\n“I'm getting used to this, but I'm still a yogurt maker,” he told some guests at the party.\nRelated Stories U.S. schools to offer Chobani yogurt as meat replacement Chobani’s steamy new ad features lesbian couple Chobani founder pledges to give away half his wealth Tags: chobani , coke , pepsi Got some hot gossip for us?\nTipline: 212-210-1616\nE-mail: confidential@nydailynews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:28:57.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
