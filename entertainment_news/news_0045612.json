The band last played at the Racehorse in 2013 during their Lovesick Tour and Matthew said they enjoyed it so much they knew they had to come back. \nThe Getaway Plan will perform at the Racehorse Hotel tonight from 8pm. \nTickets are $20 plus a booking fee pre-sale or $25 at the door. \nFor more information about the show or to buy tickets online, visit racehorsehotel.com.au racehorse hotel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:23:32.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
