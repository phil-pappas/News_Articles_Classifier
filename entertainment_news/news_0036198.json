Amid Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s four-day visit to the US, Pakistan’s National Security Advisor Sartaj Aziz yesterday submitted to the American side three separate dossiers alleging Indian involvement in subversive activities. After US Secretary of State John Kerry met Sharif here, State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters, “We continue to believe that India and Pakistan stand to benefit from practical cooperation, and we encourage both countries to engage in direct dialogue aimed at reducing tensions.” “The normalization of ties between Pakistan and India is vital to both countries and to the region, and steps that initiate closer regional trade and energy ties, we believe, will create jobs, lower inflation and increase energy supply,” he said.
