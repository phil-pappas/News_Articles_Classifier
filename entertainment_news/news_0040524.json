Photo: Shutterstock \nNow that talk has turned to bushfires, El Nino and firing up the desalination plant, it's time to think about watering. In harsh summers – not to mention harsh springs – plants face the double whammy of too much sun and too little moisture.\nIt can really tip the scales. Weight for weight plants use far more water than any animal. A single tomato plant might go through 125 litres of water in one growing season; some trees hundreds of litres in a day; succulents and eucalypts vastly less. Almost all of this water is released into the air as vapour (one of the reasons plants are being deployed to cool our cities) and it's the gardener's lot to keep up. \nIn his new book Endless Pleasure  Trevor Nottle writes about how irrigation has been challenging gardeners ever since gardens were first created. Buckets, watering cans, hoses and sprinklers have a long history. But once it was waterwheels, wells and, for those who really lashed out, aqueducts. Perforated pots for nestling beside plants to provide a slow drip of water were uncovered in the ruins of Pompeii. \nBuckets, watering cans, hoses and sprinklers have a long history. Photo: Shutterstock \nAlmost 2000 years on – when all manner of plastic drip irrigation systems and trigger hose nozzles are readily available – plant cell biologists have just discovered a gene that by slowing the rate of photosynthesis allows plants to get by with less water.\nAdvertisement The University of Oxford scientists are focusing on climate-resilient agriculture and feeding the world's growing population rather than home gardening but their preliminary findings do show where we might be headed.\nIn the meantime, having just had the hottest start to October in 75 years and with regular warnings of a \"tough\" summer ahead, what to do in order to stop plants wilting and dying? In short, harvest water, irrigate efficiently, select appropriate plants, mulch and look after your soil.\nSome people are turning to deficit irrigation strategies that allow for a degree of drought stress and maximise irrigation efficiency  rather than just maximising plant growth. It's about paying attention to the moisture content of your soil and the growth stage of your plants and is a more extreme version of how you might stop watering during winter dormancy.\nSo far have we come in terms of strategic watering that Trevor Nottle writes that old-fashioned sprinklers that spray water \"high and wide ... with much of it disappearing into the air on hot days\" have become collector's items. Some are even included in the exhibition (of the same name as Nottle's book) currently inaugurating the Australian Museum of Gardening at Carrick Hill in Adelaide.\nBut however we choose to apply water  – always deep enough to diffuse into a plant's roots – be wary that clay soils hold water longer than sandy ones and that in particularly dry conditions some soils don't absorb water at all. \nIn her book Australian Garden Rescue , Mary Horsfall says low soil water content combined with high soil temperatures (in other words what we can expect to see more often) only increase the likelihood of hydrophobic conditions. She warns the repeated application of woodchip mulches can also reduce the ability of some soils to absorb water and suggests using a variety of mulches (which reduce evaporation and keep water in the soil) from season to season. While research into hydrophobic soils is ongoing, the best way to get water to penetrate seems to be adding composted organic matter and turning the soil while giving it a long, slow soak. \nGardeners have long shifted earth to capture water. By digging swales and building berms, for example, you can channel water along the longest possible path and slow run-off. Shaping moats around particular plants also encourages water to soak into their roots. \nBiodynamic gardeners meanwhile swear by effects of the moon on rising and dropping water tables and follow lunar cycles to determine planting and harvesting times.\nAnd then there are watering times. Despite Hungarian scientists five years ago publishing a paper largely disproving the myth that water droplets on leaves causes scorching, watering in the middle of a sunny day is best avoided. Early morning or evening is ideal when the weather is cool and there is less evaporation. And steer clear of wind, which can blow your water away.\nThe book, Endless Pleasure , is published by Wakefield Press, $39.95 while the exhibition of the same name is at the Australian Museum of Gardening in Adelaide until November 28.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:30:07.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
