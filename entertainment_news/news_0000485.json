He previously hosted the Oscars in 2005. \n\"Chris Rock is truly the MVP of the entertainment industry,\" said Hill and Hudlin. \"Comedian, actor, writer, producer, director, documentarian -- he's done it all. He's going to be a phenomenal Oscar host!\" \nThe veteran comedian takes over as MC after Neil Patrick Harris hosted last year's telecast, which drew the show's lowest ratings in six years -- down 16% from the previous year's show. In an interview with Variety last month, Hill and Hudlin said they were eager to give the ABC telecast a fresh look. \n\"The challenge is to make it entertaining,\" Hill said, \"so it doesn't seem like a lesson, so the audience cares for people when they get onstage.\" \nHill, a 25-year veteran from Fox Sports, also helped launch mega-hit \"American Idol.\" Hudlin and Rock worked together on the recently defunct TV series \"Everybody Hates Chris.\" \n\"We share David and Reggie's excitement in welcoming Chris, whose comedic voice has really defined a generation,\" said Academy President Cheryl Boone Isaacs. \"He is certain to bring his amazing array of talents to this year's show.\" \nRock also said he was thrilled about his upcoming sophomore stint as host. \"I'm so glad to be hosting the Oscars,\" Rock said. \"It's great to be back.\" \nIn the decade since Rock hosted, Ellen DeGeneres MCed the ceremony twice (2007, 2014), as did Jon Stewart (2006, 2008). Hugh Jackman (2009), Billy Crystal (2012), Seth MacFarlane (2013), and the duos of Steve Martin and Alec Baldwin (2010) and James Franco and Anne Hathaway (2011) also hosted Hollywood's biggest event of the year. \nThe 2016 Oscars will be held at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood on Feb. 28. \nVariety", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:33:32.454+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
