The acting is very good, unlike some scary movies, the dramatic music is perfect for this kind of film, and there are more than a few jumpy moments; disturbing, creepy, and violent scenes; and the kind of shocking images that make your mouth drop. The production and set design, along with the costumes, is especially appropriate, given the setting of the film. \nThe film begins in America, where Edith Cushing (Wasikowska) meets and falls for Sir Thomas Sharpe (Hiddleston), a handsome and charming English gentleman with a mysterious past. After the unexpected and suspicious death of Edith's father, she decides to move to England to live in her new husband's family estate with him and his sister, Lady Lucille Sharpe (Chastain). Edith is hardly there any time before she begins to suspect there is more to this cold, dark, old and withering house in the middle of nowhere. As the film goes on, Edith learns more about her new family's history and quickly finds out that the house is much more than just haunted. <!--iframe--> \nNormally, I'm not one for scary movies, but when I saw who was directing this film and the cast attached, I knew I had to check it out. Dating back to \"Blade II\" (2002) and \"Pan's Labyrinth\" (2006), and all the way up to \"Pacific Rim\" (2013) and \"The Hobbit\" films, I've long been a fan of director, Guillermo del Toro (or GDT, for the sake of brevity). He has a very unique style and has created several incredible, one-of-a-kind, disturbing creatures. Once the casting details were released, and Hiddleston, Chastain, and Hunnam joined, I was sold. Upon watching the film, my high expectations were pleasantly met with an experience worthy of recognition. Click here to visit the official \"Crimson Peak\" website \nAt the beginning of \"Crimson Peak,\" Wasikowska's character at a younger age is visited by a demon-like creature who warns her to \"beware of Crimson Peak,\" which she knows nothing about at the time. This floating, hooded, Dementor-from-Harry-Potter-looking creature can move through walls and periodically shows itself to Edith throughout the film. From first glance at this monster, typical of a GDT film, it was apparent that the rest of the movie would hold more than a few scary moments. \nThe stars of \"Crimson Peak\" (Photo: Lionsgate Films) \nAside from the creature that visits Edith, there are a handful of violent and graphically gory or disturbing scenes, some of which feature someone getting hurt, stabbed, poisoned, their head smashed, coughing up blood, and breaking bones, among other unfortunate fates. Adding more unique visual flair, there are also several creepy close up shots of bugs, such as one in which Lady Sharpe feeds a butterfly to a large group of ants. Between things that pop out at you, which is usually intensified by music and extra fast or slow paced camera movements, and weird, disturbing visuals, the film will be more than uncomfortable for some audiences. \nAs far as acting goes, the main actors rival each other for best performance. Hiddleston is extremely good and dramatic; Wasikowska gives just the right amount of emotion, fear, strength, and appeal for the victim role; Chastain is very dark and evil, never smiling unless from pleasure of something bad; and English-speaking Hunnam uses an American accent and plays a nice gentleman and childhood friend of Edith's, while being a part of the Edith love triangle. Hunnam's character is the safe, right love choice for Edith, while Hiddleston is an unknown bad boy. Most of their performances play into the setting of the film, and much of the acting feels very formal, like that of a stage play or old, classical English film. \nComing from someone who usually doesn't go towards the scarier end of the horror movie pool, this film wasn't too much to handle. Just like most films, not everything works here, so there are naturally some moments that are corny or just plain stupid. Some of the time, the film presents the kind of horror that you just can't help but to smile or laugh at. The film is very predictable and, really, not all that surprising, and the plot is fairly conventional. It's the execution that sets it apart. \nTom Hiddleston in \"Crimson Peak\" (Photo: Lionsgate Films) \nWhen speaking about his film, GDT mentioned that it \"has two or three scenes that are really disturbing in a modern way,\" that \"it's a proper R rating,\" and that \"it's a very set-oriented, classical, but at the same time, modern take on a ghost story.\" This sums up \"Crimson Peak\" well. It has a bit of classic gothic romance, a bit of horror, some unsettling content, action, suspense, fantasy, violence, and more. It feels like an adult horror film that was made a long time ago, minus the special effects. \nIf you're a fan of scary movies or GDT's style of filmmaking, I encourage you to check out this film. \"Crimson Peak\" is clearly not for all audiences, but even if you're not a fan of horror flicks, if any part of this film interests you, then by all means take a chance on it. I don't see many scary movies, but I'd have to put this one towards the top, as far as they go. \nRated 3.5 out of 5 stars. \n\"Crimson Peak\" is rated R for bloody violence, some sexual content and brief strong language. Running time is 1 hour and 59 minutes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:42:48.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
