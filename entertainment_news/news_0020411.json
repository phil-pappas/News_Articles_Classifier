Over ten people have been taken into custody in connection with the clashes, police said here. \nTension broke out when members of one community accused the members of the other of “desecration” of a religious poster which was allegedly found torn in Darshanpurwa area under Fazalganj police station. \nAfter a stone-pelting incident, the Uttar Pradesh police managed to bring the situation temporarily under control by making the religious leaders of the two communities to talk and come to a compromise. Police, PAC and CISF personnel were also deployed in the area to maintain law and order, according to District Magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma. \nHowever, more clashes broke out when religious processions of the other community began in the evening. Members of the two communities pelted stones at each other in GT Road in Jarib Chowki, while two motorcycles were set ablaze near Sangeet Cinema. Two more motorcycles were set on fire in Deputy Padaw area, police said. \n“In total, around a dozen vehicles in different localities were destroyed by the mob,” a police official said adding that the police resorted to lathi charge and tear gas shells to disperse the crowd. \nBesides scuffles in Chamanganj and Darshapurwa areas, tension was also reported from Yashoda Nagar area where people closed their shops, SSP Shalabh Mathur said. In Bhannapurwa area, two policemen who were on patrol were injured when a mob opened fire at them, the DM, who also received minor injuries, said. \nThe injured inspectors – DK Singh and MP Sharma – were hit in their legs and have been admitted to a medical college where their condition is said to be stable. ”Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), banning assembly of over five people in an area has been enforced. Police have been asked to conduct flag marches in tense areas and all markets have been ordered to remain closed tomorrow,” Sharma said. \nStating that the administration has written to mobile service providers to block bulk messaging through WhatsApp to prevent spread of rumours, he said, “Anybody found indulging in rumour-mongering will be dealt with firmly.” He, however, said the situation was tense only in some areas, while other parts were normal. \nSSP Mathur said police personnel from across the city have been put on high alert. “Though situation continues to be tense, it is under control,” he said. \n  25, 2015 12:59 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T22:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:11:33.822+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
