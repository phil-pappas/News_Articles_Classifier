His former Creedence bandmates Stu Cook and Doug Clifford have for years performed as Creedence Clearwater Revisited, for years creating a litigious feud with Fogerty.\nFogerty's shows will be Jan. 8-9, 13, 15-16, 20, 22 and 23. Tickets start at $59.50 and go on sale Oct. 9 at the Venetian and through its website.\nJudds bring back-porch... Bunkhouse Saloon to reopen...
