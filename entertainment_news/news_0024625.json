Photo: Simon O'Dwyer \nChoreographer Antony Hamilton has a new work, Nyx , at Melbourne Festival, that starts with the simplest of ideas yet fills a performance space with sound, energy and possibility. Nyx , which takes its title from the name of the classical goddess of night, the mother of death and sleep, is an investigation of movement, voice and percussion with a very particular focus.\nHamilton was interested in starting with a single challenge, exploring the notion that \"all the material and content of the work should be contained in one gesture, that the performers on stage would generate, develop and mould a visual space with sculptural objects, and that they would also create a soundscape through the movement of those objects\".\nFour dancers – Rachel Coulson, Lauren Langlois, Kathleen Lott and Lily Paskas – make up the core group, with an additional ensemble of eight. There is no recorded sound. Through voice, body percussion, the stamping of feet, the manipulation of and interaction with objects – anything from small metal balls to long sticks to large clay pots – sound is produced as part of the ebb and flow of movement in the cavernous space of the Meat Market. \"It's a technical challenge, but thematic from the point of view that I really wanted to see what was possible in gesture without having external elements to support that. Benjamin Cisterne's lighting provides the only external element.\nNyx, a new work from Anthony Hamilton, fuses dance, voice and percussion. Photo: Simon O'Dwyer \nEarlier in the process Hamilton brought in Matthias Schack-Arnott and Eugene Ughetti from Speak Percussion to advise and give some master classes on sound production. \"They came in to work with me and develop a soundscape with dancers, to give them a training in percussion.\"\nAdvertisement \"I got a collection of visually driven objects, whose shape and form I was interested in and that complemented the physicality of some of the movement ideas,\" Hamilton says. \"I had certain movements that generated sound, but they were limited. What I needed was some expert musicians to say, 'Have you thought of dropping something in this vessel, other than just pushing it along the floor? What does one object dropping in it sound like? What about 20 at the same time? How can we differentiate that kind of volume? You're interested in rhythm but what would amore textured sound be like?\"\nIn Nyx , Hamilton can see two strands of his work coming together. \"It used to be that I was interested in more visually driven fantastical worlds that you can create on the stage; on the other hand I was also interested in the more technical problem-solving of choreographic ideas. And more and more, they're crossing over, and I've realised they don't need to be mutually exclusive. I've realised that as I focus on the mechanics, the narrative emerges on its own and I don't need to force it.\"\nNyx has been in development for several years. In between, Hamilton has made two major works and several smaller commissions. In some ways, he says, the delay has an effect. \"Performers have brought a level of sophistication they didn't have two years ago, I had the opportunity to reshape things a bit and think about what working and what was not.\" But in other ways, it's retained a great deal of what was there already, \"which I'm happy about, I'm glad the things that interested me are still there. When you return to something, it's as if time stands still and you're back there in that space. It's a world that's created, and that world has its own properties and possibilities.\"\nHamilton says that uncertainty around arts funding, following former federal arts minister George Brandis' decision to take $100 million off the Australia Council to fund a new National Program for Excellence in the Arts, has had an impact on his practice. It's the same for others he says, those in mid-career and those starting out, and it's bound to inhibit the kind of work that people will make.\n\"Art is the ultimate reflection of how much we value it. Work speaks volumes about what's there. Everyone likes to think – and artists themselves like to think – that we make our autonomous decision and choose what we're going to do based purely on the philosophy or vision or aesthetic behind it. But I really believe that economy can massively drive aesthetics and philosophy, because it pushes you into corners that you have to adapt to.\n\"How can I be creative within the paradigm, how can I be creative with what's there? It's not to say that great work won't be produced in those circumstances – but what type of work?\"\nNyx is at Arts House Meat Market, North Melbourne until October 11. There will be a post-show Q&A with Anthony Hamilton after the 2pm show on October 11.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T08:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:51:08.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
