For two reasons: a) I think man should take the consequences of his folly, and (b) I don’t think men, on the whole, have the right to believe that their cause is a bigger or better thing than that which their cause proposes to better. Or, more likely, eliminate.\nNot that any of this prevents people, including me, from having causes. One of mine often surprises me: the California mountain lion, or cougar. Four years ago it was a species threatened with extinction by California’s pointless bounty system.\nUnder the bounty system, from 1907 until four years ago, California hunters collected from $20 to $60 each for slaying 12,461 mountain lions. A beautiful animal, which is generally accepted as an important part of our wildlife program, was being murdered out of existence.\n\nFour years ago I was part of a little scramble, which got our stout lads in Sacramento to place a four-year moratorium on bounty payments for the slaughter of mountain lions.\nThis bounty moratorium expires on October 1, 1967. A new bill (Assembly Bill 940) has already passed the lower house. A hearing on it in the California Senate has been requested for today. The bill would replace the four-year moratorium with permanent repeal.\nAt issue is whether the bounty is to be resumed or discontinued, and perhaps whether the lion will be made a game animal or will be given protection.\nThe moratorium has worked well. There have been no reports of significant increase of predation in that period. The State Fish and Game Department is for repeal of the bounty, believing that predators have a place in our wildlife program.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:23:59.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
