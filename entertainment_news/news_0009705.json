Simons was a single act while Renee — pronounced “Renny” — Boghosian (later Goodwin) was performing with the now well-known folk artist Bill Staines. \nBoston's folk music scene in the ‘60s was, along with New York's Greenwich Village, teeming with folk performers who became major names in the industry. These two individual talents did not come together, however, until 2006, when their long friendship turned into Simons and Goodwin. The duo has a smooth sound consisting of intricate arrangements, tight expression and beautiful harmonies. Their eclectic repertoire is primarily folk, but delivers country, old rock, jazz and blues standards with similar musical skill. Their original songs include the popular song \"The Portland\" about the foundering of the steamer Portland in the great Portland Gale of 1898. \nGoodwin moved to Boston from Augusta to be part of the Boston/Cambridge folk music scene. She worked for about a year with Staines as Bill and Renee, recording, with John Synnott, the album “A Bag of Rainbows” that has become a collector’s item. Following her time with Staines, she performed in the Boston area with another singer/songwriter, Mike Orlen. Then she moved back to Augusta, settled down and raised a family, continuing to perform in numerous venues throughout Maine. \nSimons also began as a soloist in the Boston area, and was active in the 1970s in the Watkins Marsh Bumppe Shoppe, a duo act with longtime friend Jim King. In the ‘80s, Simons joined with Jon Roper and Myra Franks (now Myra MacLeod) and formed the Generic String Band, which evolved into Frosty Morn' with the addition of hammered dulcimer player Sally McKnight. All of these groups produced albums, and Frosty Morn' performed into the ‘90s. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
