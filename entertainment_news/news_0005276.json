A clerk granted the request in such a way that the divorce papers can be refiled at a later date.\nThe document doesn't state a reason for the change. It shows Odom signed off on dismissing the divorce Tuesday.\nKardashian has been by Odom's side since he was found in extremely critical condition Oct. 13 at the Love Ranch brothel in the rural community of Crystal, Nevada. He regained consciousness Friday and was transported to Los Angeles on Monday to recover.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T23:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:02:39.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
