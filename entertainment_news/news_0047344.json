A year later, Iran's late leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa, or edict, calling for Rushdie's death. \nIran has also offered over $3 million in reward for anyone who kills Rushdie.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T10:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T11:38:09.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
