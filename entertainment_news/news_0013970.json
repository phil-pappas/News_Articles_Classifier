And we're doing it now,\" Ono said.\nLennon was assassinated in 1980 at his apartment building across from Central Park. The 35th anniversary of his death will be observed in December.\nCopyright 2015 by United Press International Share Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1734108&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1734108", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1734108&h=VIDEO%3A+2%2C000+form+human+peace+sign+for+Lennon+tribute+in+New+York"], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:04:29.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
