Not so much, I think, because of its feelings about the characters, but because of who’s portraying them, the well-loved James Earl Jones and Cicely Tyson. \nThe great pleasure in the revival of D.L. Coburn’s 1977 two-hander, which opened Wednesday night at the John Golden Theatre, is watching the veteran performers (he’s 84, she’s believed to be 90) work together with warmth and humor, not missing a beat. (They last appeared together on Broadway 49 years ago, in \"A Hand Is on the Gate.\") \nWeller, portrayed by Jones with his usual authority, is a grump, a complainer, a once-successful businessman who’s angry at having to live in a rundown facility whose inhabitants include welfare recipients and people who are simply old. \n\"Half of them are catatonic,\" he grouses to Fonsia. \"And sometimes the ones who do talk make you appreciate the ones who don’t.\" \nPolite and seemingly modest, she’s a contrast to Weller, a difference emphasized by their physical disparity: He’s very large; she’s wispy. \nWeller has fastened onto Fonsia, a newbie at the home, mainly because he’s eager to find a gin rummy partner and she’s lucid. \nWith a superior attitude, he teaches her the game, and as they play, hand after hand, the stories of their lives emerge — alongside a running joke: Beginner Fonsia beats Weller every time, except for one occasion where she appears to let him triumph. And each time she wins, he gets more upset. \nAfraid of his temper but still feisty, Fonsia tries out different, non-confrontational ways of saying \"gin\" when she lays out her hand after each victory, hoping to keep him calm. With Tyson’s perfect comic timing, the series of choices becomes very funny. \nWeller and Fonsia, we learn, have more in common than we might have suspected. They’re both alienated from their children, and alone in the world. No one comes to see them on visitors day. \nThe expected progression of the story – if you’ve never seen the play before — is that these two people, who seem to have an essential affinity, will, ultimately, fill up the emotional gaps in each other’s lives. \nIt’s an expectation bolstered by the actors’ easy compatibility, our affection for them, and also by the direction of Leonard Foglia, which has a certain lightness to it. \nBut things get darker, not brighter. As the intensity of the gin games increases, the two characters retreat to their worst selves, picking at one another’s scabs. \nFonsia tells Weller that he might have failed in business not because of bad luck or betrayal but because of incompetence, while he suggests she drove away her husband and son because of her rigidity and self-righteousness (qualities which don’t exactly jump out of Tyson’s performance). \nThe play’s ending, with Weller’s burst of colossal rage and Fonsia’s retreat into loneliness, has always been unsatisfying. In this production, it’s just more so. \nBut that frustration is easily trumped by the production’s great gift of allowing us to see Jones and Tyson perform together. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:48:36.965+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
