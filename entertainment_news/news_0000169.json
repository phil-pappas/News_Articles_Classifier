Bassist Nikki Sixx criticized the drummer in a letter he posted online. \nHowever, it appears Neil wants no part of the drama, and when the singer was asked to address the spat he said, \"You have to ask Nikki about that, 'cos I had no idea there was anything between us and Metallica until I read it.\" \nAsked to comment on the tweet Lee posted earlier this month, he added, \"I had nothing to do with it. Because, like I said, I had no idea that there was any bad blood between us and Metallica.\" \nHe then ended the interview with 105.9's The Brew in Portland when host Tanner asked him another question about the drama. \nThe angry host said, \"Unbelievable. Was it just me or was he being kind of d**k there...? If you wanna come on the air, at least put a little effort into it.\" Copyright WENN.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T21:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T05:24:21.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
