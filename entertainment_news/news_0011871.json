It's like these planets are intent on shining a spotlight on all the answers to the question, \"What could go wrong?\" This square brings much more precaution into the situation than is necessary. On the bright side, no one will get hurt by being too careful.\nARIES (March 21-April 19). There's a time to extend your arms and a time to retract them, hugging your own soul. This is your pulling-back time. Go where you feel surrounded by comfort and safety.\nTAURUS (April 20-May 20). As per usual, the healthiest thing is not the easiest thing. However, doing the healthy thing enough times makes it an automatic choice -- just part of who you are. The hardest part is the first 20 times.\nGEMINI (May 21-June 21). There are people in your life who are best loved from a distance. When they are in your daily life, you'll find yourself constantly enforcing boundaries. It's not fun.\nCANCER (June 22-July 22). There's a lot you could accomplish with a little more self-control. Willpower takes more energy than you think. The way to get more of it is to figure out what's draining your energy and plug that drain.\nLEO (July 23-Aug. 22). Time seems to be getting away from you. Get organized. Clean up. Make lists. Declutter your life, and suddenly your relationship with time will seem more amicable.\nVIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22). You're used to a certain amount of social risk, but things are about to get more intense. Whether this is about being more vulnerable to one person or to many, you've got the courage for it.\nLIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 23). Intuition is vying for your attention in the form of a voice in your head -- or not a voice exactly, but more like the idea that comes before you speak. Nothing bad will happen if you don't act on this immediately, but do take note.\nSCORPIO (Oct. 24-Nov. 21). You elevate simple matters to the level of an art form. Others who don't take it quite so far will be impressed and inspired once they get past being jealous.\nSAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21). The formerly blurred lines between friendship, family, love, business and other social matters are now coming into sharp focus. Everyone knows what the bottom line is and where the power lies.\nCAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19). The exertion you think will make you tired actually makes you stronger, calmer and happier. So get into the mess that's going to have you sweating. If you're angry with someone, bonus: You'll work harder.\nAQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18). Your instinct lines up with another person's logic -- brilliant. This might not work in the other direction, but you can worry about that later. For now, take this win and go forward with shared plans.\nPISCES (Feb. 19-March 20). In the early stages of a relationship, everything seems significant. Precedence is set. You know everything that happens means something, even when you're not sure what exactly.\nTODAY'S BIRTHDAY (Oct. 10). This year is marked by invention, the main one being the invention of the new you. Other innovations will fall under the category of usefulness. December brings money and assistance. Your love life is rich in 2016. You'll be paid a bonus in January and May. An investment in your family will benefit all. Cancer and Scorpio people adore you. Your lucky numbers are: 9, 2, 14, 28 and 17.\nASTROLOGICAL QUESTIONS: \"I've had a string of bad luck, and I hope it's over now. In the past year, I've lost three family members, a cat I had for 16 years, half of my income and a 10-year relationship. I don't think I can take any more. Tell me that it's going to be over soon. I need some good luck! My birthday is January 14.\"\nMy deepest condolences go out to you. Capricorns sometimes feel like it's necessary to always be doing something, even in times of great trial. Your work ethic is strong, and so is your need to keep up a powerful public persona. It will be challenging for you to take time for yourself to grieve and regain your sense of normalcy. Remind yourself to take life slow. Healing is a process. Be gentle with yourself, allowing for the full range of feelings that you might experience. Instead of trying to control your emotions, flow with them -- even if that means breaking down and crying. Trying to hold it all in will be draining and will diminish your power. Let yourself go through the sad feelings as they come, and know that they are a bridge in your healing -- you will feel better when you get to the other side.\nCELEBRITY PROFILES: Film director Ed Wood Jr. made an unforgettable mark on the film industry even though the critics largely regarded his films as models of bad filmmaking. Libra's joyous artistic spirit was alive in his main creative aim: to make people happy, regardless of the resources or talent available to him to do so. So impactful were his efforts that he's revered in a religion: the Church of Ed Wood.\nTo write to Holiday Mathis, visit www.creators.com and click \"Write the Author\" on her page.
