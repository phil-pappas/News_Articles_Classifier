Back To The Future cast then and now, and what they're all up to these days... \n— Lea Thompson (@LeaKThompson) July 17, 2015 \nIt’s also the date that Marty McFly went time-travelling in Back To The Future. Back To The Future (Universal) \nSo, naturally, we got to wondering where Marty (played by Michael J Fox) and the rest of the cast are these days. \nMichael J Fox: Then… \nNow… Michael J Fox in December 2014 (Kathy Willens/AP) \nMichael J Fox starred in all three Back To The Future movies, but also made a name for himself on TV in Family Ties. \nFrom 1996-2001 he found fame in another successful TV series, Spin City. His role as Mike Flaherty won him a few accolades, among them an Emmy and a few Golden Globes. \nIn 1991 he was diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease, but only went public with his illness in 1998. At 54, the Canadian-born star has most recently been starring in TV drama The Good Wife. \nChristopher Lloyd: Then… \nNow… Christopher Lloyd in 2014 ( Chris Pizzello/Invision) \nWho could forget Doc Brown? Christopher had already starred in One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest and in the TV series Taxi by the time his role as Doc came a-calling. \nHe also starred in Who Framed Roger Rabbit as Judge Doom. However, he’d welcome the chance to play Doc again. During an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, he said: “I would love to do Doc again, no question.” \nLea Thompson: Then… \nNow… Lea Thompson attends the premiere of The Wrong Side Of Right (Paul A Hebert/Invision) \nFor as much as Marty was the pin-up everyone was loving from the movie, Lea’s character Lorraine Baines had her fair share of admirers too. \nLea graced TV screens in the 1990s comedy Caroline In The City and also starred in a string of hit movies like Howard the Duck, Some Kind Of Wonderful and All The Right Moves. \nThomas F Wilson: Then… Biff Tanner (Universal/Everett/Rex) \nNow… Kids + box fan = Chewbacca. @TomWilsonUSA has some words of wisdom for you at 11P on MSG. https://t.co/menBI22UGm \n— MSG Networks (@MSGNetworks) September 20, 2015 \nRemember Biff Tannen, resident Back To The Future bully? Well, he’s now doing stand-up comedy. And he’s actually pretty entertaining. Share article \nPrior to that he’s had a few roles, starring in Freaks And Geeks on TV, and also in The Heat, Melissa McCarthy’s movie.
