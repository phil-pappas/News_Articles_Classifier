Maybe there is some theme behind the chicken poses that the average person doesn't understand, or perhaps Beyonce has just run out of ideas to get the public's attention. At any rate, there are pictures of her posing with a big white chicken with the American flag draped over her shoulder, according to Hello Beautiful on Monday.\nBeyonce posted several photos on her Instagram account . She is seen wearing a white swimsuit and clutching a big white chicken in different positions. In some of the photos, the singer and dancer cuddles the chicken close to her face. This is the 34-year-old's first print interview since 2013. She answered a short round of unrelated questions, including some questions about her success.\nIn the photos, Beyonce has the name BEAT, the British music magazine written in red letters on her white swimsuit. On the cover, the singer-songwriter, and actress appears in a striped red and white swimsuit. The images were shot by Ryan McGinley in the Hamptons. In additions to the chicken photos, Beyonce is seen riding a bicycle in one photo, and in another photo, she is posing in a field of lavender.\nThe wife of Jay Z and mother of three-year-old Blue Ivy must have a good reason behind the poses with the chicken, but as of now no one knows what the reason is. In time, the question about the chicken will be answered, but for now we just have to wonder or use our own imagination to come to our own conclusion.", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/beylite/", "http://hellobeautiful.com/2015/10/19/beyonce-beat-magazine-photoshoot/?omcamp=EMC-CVNL&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=BP%20101915%20PM&utm_term=Black%20Planet%20Daily%20USE%20ME"], "published": "2015-10-20T01:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:56:19.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
