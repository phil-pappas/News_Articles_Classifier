At least I think it was.\nThe trio was performing to celebrate the release of its latest album, “Moving Mountains.” If you had to classify the group in a record store, you would place it under “jazz” (the record will come out in vinyl at the end of the year, so you can look for it there). But the pieces on the album and in concert were well arranged compositions, whereas many jazz tunes are just sketchy introductions for extended improvisations. The trio did improvise, but its melodic themes kept recurring throughout the songs, instead of only appearing at the beginning and the end.\n“Giving Thanks” began with DeChellis pounding out a couple of chords with his left hand on the grand piano and exploring with his right. “Departure” and “Doobie” were ballads with standup bassist Scot Hornick playing a melodic counterpoint to DeChellis. “Angst,” despite its title, was a bouncy number, jazzier and a bit looser, letting DeChellis show his dexterity on the keyboard.\nAll of the tunes in the hour-and-a-half set could have been done with solo piano, but Hornick and drummer Tom Papadatos added extra layers, often helping to build to dramatic climaxes. Both used many different techniques. At various points, Hornick followed DeChellis’ left hand, plucked out heavy single notes, and did a beautiful bowed string solo on “Epic.”\nPapadatos seemed a bit loud at first, but on reflection, that fit with the group’s contemporary sound. DeChellis introduced the title track “Moving Mountains” by talking about his love of progressive rock, where you don’t want too soft of a sound. Papadatos switched between sticks, brushes, and mallets, and frequently bounced his sticks off his cymbals. Throughout the evening he produced a variety of complex rhythms.\nDeChellis introduced and gave brief explanations about most of his works. He said “Distant Memory” reminded him of his trip to Ireland. There was nothing Celtic about it, however. It had a semi-classical, chamber music sound, evoking a melancholy feel. “Anticipation,” from and earlier CD, was given a powerful boost by the rhythm section.\n“Never Satisfied” was a change of pace. Inspired by the group Little Feat, it was funky and swampy, with an added hint of blues. “My Old Man” was wistful, although not sad. “G.F.Y.S.B.P.” was the most abstract song of the night, with pounding chords that made it sound like modern classical. DeChellis even reached into the piano to pluck the strings.\nThe audience of about 75 appeared happy with what they heard from this unique trio. Perhaps the person who best understood the music was the pre-teen who kept raising his hand to flash the rock “devil’s horn” sign.\nDave Howell is a freelance writer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:59:53.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
