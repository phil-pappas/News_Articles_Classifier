My mum left when I was eight. My anger didn't really surface until I was 12 or 13. It was triggered because my parents were going to get reconciled and didn't.\nAll those years I'd been holding out hope that they would.\n\"After she left I became a fearful kid who felt powerless. I couldn't go into the house on my own. I'd wait outside, scared, frustrated. Growing up I was scared of the dark. I was scared of heights. It limited me.\"\nFather of two adopted children, Jackman thinks his kids will relate to the character in his new movie \"Pan\".\n\"I was more sensitive about film's connection to my two adopted children. Every movie I do, I think, 'My kids are going to see this.' When it's a movie about adoption, I want to make sure that they don't feel uncomfortable. Peter Pan is a classic tale, but now we live in a different world where we're more sensitive about adoption,\" he said.\n George Clooney denies dyetting plastic surgery done - TOI\nChappie - Booklet Special Edition Amazon.in : INR 1,000.00 ", "external_links": ["http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C32dYAq3L._SL160_.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/rJID1017PVM", "https://www.pinterest.com/timesofindia/", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107628521107103264647/+TOIEntertainment/posts", "https://twitter.com/TOIEntertain", "http://www.amazon.in/Chappie-Booklet-Special-Sharlto-Copley/dp/B00YTYHJDY%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJP4GPDYQHXPFUOWQ%26tag%3Dtimofind-21%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB00YTYHJDY"], "published": "2015-10-03T02:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T19:14:48.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
