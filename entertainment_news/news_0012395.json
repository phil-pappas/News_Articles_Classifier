But one doctor says taking a few minutes to look for a few specific things can help your health.\n\"Whether it's for the first time or the hundredth time,\" don't skip the scope, said Dr. Rajesh Mishra, vice president of medical and clinical affairs at McNeil Consumer Healthcare, which produces over-the-counter medicine for Johnson & Johnson.\nFor example, even if you've grabbed that same medication before, the dosage might have changed.\n\"People sometimes think, 'Oh, it's an OTC medicine, it's minor stuff,'\" Mishra said. But know what you're putting in your body. \"It's really important,\" he added.\nFirst, check the suggested uses, to ensure it matches what you need. People should look at how much to use throughout one day and what active ingredients it contains.\n\"They have to be very diligent,\" Mishra said.\nThen, look at parts of the label that indicate whether it is the right medicine for you — for example, if you shouldn't use it while breast-feeding, or when to double check with a doctor. Some labels might suggest consulting a physician in the case of heart disease, diabetes or high blood pressure.\nAnd very important? That \"do not use\" section. Read through the list of cautions, for example, in case of pairing with certain anti-depression drugs.\nSide effects are another thing to be sure to read over — that way you will know what to expect. Some labels will advise stopping if you experience nervousness, dizziness or sleeplessness. Pair that information with the list of what not to combine with the medicine. For example, if it says not to mix with alcohol, take that seriously.\nAnd awareness shouldn't stop there. If sickness persists, people might not want to simply buy another box.\n\"If they end up having a symptom that is occurring over and over again, they should not just assume they should continue using the OTC medicine,\" Mishra said.\nHe added, \"You don't want to miss something else which might be happening, which is causing their symptoms.\"\nabowen@tribpub.com\nTwitter @byalisonbowen\n Drugs and Medicines", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561bbf5c/turbine/sc-one-simple-thing-otc-medication-health-1021-20151003"], "published": "2015-10-12T17:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:37:35.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
