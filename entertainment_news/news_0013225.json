She says, “The truth always rises to the surface. If one has faith and hope they can conquer any situation, even if it seems impossible.”\nPublished by New York City-based Page Publishing, Ruth Lloyd-Harlin’s fascinating tale tells the compelling life story of Eddie Joe Lloyd, retelling his early years from his first crime at the age nine, to his downward spiral as a petty criminal and drug addicted before he reached twenty, to the events that occurred during and after his seventeen-year incarceration.\nThis book is a scrutiny of one of the most famous cases of wrongful conviction, and how Eddie persevered and brought to light the shortcomings of the United States criminal justice system.\nReaders who wish to experience this gripping work can purchase “Into Every Life Tears Must Fall” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708.\nAbout Page Publishing\nPage Publishing is a traditional New York based full-service publishing house that handles all of the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
