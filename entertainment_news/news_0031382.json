Earthplace Festival a day for family 1 / 4 Back to Gallery \nThe wonderful thing about the Earthplace Festival is that staff loves the one-day event about as much as the public. \nThat’s the opinion of Sarah Ferrante , a spokeswoman for the Westport nature center. Ferrante said community response to last year’s inaugural family event was “tremendous — attracting about 1,500 children and adults” under clear skies. \nIt is hoped that the weather will again be glorious, with sunny skies and balmy temperatures on Sunday, Oct. 4. \n“Last year, we were looking for a new event outdoors that would showcase who we are and what we do, and a fall festival was a perfect fit,” she said. More Information \nEarthplace, 10 Woodside Lane, Westport. Sunday, Oct. 4, 10 a.m.-5 p.m. $10 for children 2 and older; $5 for adults. 203-557-4400, earthplace.org \nAccording to its statement, Earthplace/ The Nature Discovery Center ’s “mission is to build a passion in our community for nature and the environment through education, experience and action.” \nIn this 74-acre sanctuary, are animal exhibits, a Connecticut Birds of Prey exhibit (that includes two bald eagles), walking trails and an indoor interactive nature museum. The grounds are open daily from dawn to dusk, free of charge. \n“The kids loved it, the adults loved it and we loved it,” said Ferrante of last year’s event. “It’s such fun for everyone. \n“The beauty and bounty of fall, with a day full of festive activities and seasonal crafts” will be celebrated, along with the great outdoors, she explained. An apple slingshot competition (the wildlife gets to feast on the apples when the day is over) is among the highlights, as is a “corn pool.” \n“Instead of jumping into a pool of water, kids have the opportunity to experience a pool filled with corn kernels,” she explained. A Forest Fairyland is among the new features; small “houses” for tiny fairies will be set among the trees for children to find and explore. \nAn obstacle trail, a huge slide made of hay bales and a maze cut from a field of sassafras are planned, as are “critter encounters” with denizens of the center. Also on hand will be a selection of food trucks, refreshments and music. \nAnd if you’re not tired out by all these events, Ferrante said that early October’s mild temperatures should provide the perfect situation for an exploration along one or more of the center’s trails, which are estimated to take 15 to 30 minutes to complete. \nOf special note is the Swamp Loop Trail (30 minutes), which is at its “best for viewing spring and summer wildflowers.” It winds past a swamp, a freshwater stream, a pond and woodlands, the center says. \nAlso of interest is the “Wheels in the Woods IV” trail that the center says is “fully accessible to individuals in wheelchairs or walkers, those with strollers, or anyone looking for a flat, easy walk. The trail follows the edge where forest and field meet, an excellent habitat for many species of insects, birds and mammals.” \npasboros@ctpost.com; Twitter: @PhyllisASBoros", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:03:21.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
