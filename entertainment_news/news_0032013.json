She said: \"I was 14 when I had my first relationship with a guy. I would say he was about 26.\" She added: \"I don't want to say that I suffered it, because I wanted it. I don't want to say that I was forced to do it. I don't want people to think I was abused as a kid but I was definitely more mature than I should have been at 14.\" The 'Body on Me' hitmaker has admitted the attention she received from the man made her feel \"sexy\" at the time. Rita - who originally opened up to Lifetime TV in 2013 - explained: \"I can't begin to tell you how confident I felt when a man was interested in me. I felt like I was sexy, I felt like I had a form of respect, I felt like he listened to me.\"Now I know he listened to me because he obviously wanted to have sex with me. I felt good that men fancied me.\" The blonde beauty's revelations have been dug up by authors Douglas Wight and Jenn Wiley for her autobiography 'Hot Right Now', which the The Sun on Sunday today (25.10.15) has published extracts from.'Hot Right Now,' named after Rita's first single, documents her journey from a refugee in war-torn Kosovo to a world-renowned pop star. celebrity", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:01:02.145+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
