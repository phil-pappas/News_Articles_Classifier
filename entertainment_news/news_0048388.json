We will also manage the game play experience and when it’s all said and done, we’ll pack up and take it home.”\nKnockerball Orlando is an independent business licensed through Boca Raton-based Knockerball USA LP, an international brand and the largest supplier of Knockerballs with more than 180 knockerball-affiliated businesses using the brand and product.\n“Knockerball isn’t just bubble soccer though,” Thomas stressed, before adding, “We play several different games like, sharks and minnows, King of the Hill, Last Man Standing, Red Rover and our favorite Knockerbrawl.”\nIn just one hour, according to Thomas, the company can usually accommodate between 60 and 80 players, and depending on the event that can translate to $300 to $800 an hour in funds generated for an Orlando fundraising event.\nThe Orlando Fundraising Packages include: 10 Knockerballs, all the necessary equipment for any of the company’s games and a referee to manage all of the gameplay.\n“The only thing that’s needed from you to make sure that your event is a success is a volunteer to collect money should you decide to charge per person for people to play,” Thomas noted. “To get more details on how Knockerball Orlando can aid with your fundraising efforts give us a call at 407-252-2611.”\nAs to what makes Knockerball Orlando different from everything else on the market, Thomas pointed out that his company uses only genuine Knockerball products.\n“Knockerball is the biggest and best name in the bubble soccer industry,” Thomas noted. “Other companies are often times just ordering cheap equipment off of some foreign trade site. Was any quality control ever done? It definitely was at Knockerball.”\nFor more information, please visit: http://www.knockerballorlando.com/orlando-fundraising-events/\nAbout Knockerball Orlando\nKnockerball Orlando is a company that provides a game in which people inside inflatable spheres collide with their coworkers and bosses while playing soccer, football or red rover as a team-building exercise.\nSource: Knockerball Orlando LLC\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13011812.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13011812.htm", "http://www.knockerballorlando.com/orlando-fundraising-events/", "http://www.knockerballorlando.com/"], "published": "2015-10-08T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:39:08.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
