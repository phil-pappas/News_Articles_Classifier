Singh, Minister of State in Prime Minister’s Office, was speaking at a function to flag off 300 volunteers of BJP-affiliated Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) for Patna to take part in Bihar election campaign. ”Bihar has no option but Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the question is not who is better than the other but the real question is whether, other than BJP, is there any alternative political dispensation which can offer equal opportunity to each and every citizen particularly the youth regardless of their family lineage or political clout,” he said. (Also Read: India setting up chain of high-tech viral diagnostic labs) Singh said, the voter has grown mature faster than many of the politicians and therefore, merely unsubstantiated speeches or rhetorical references are not going to make any difference. ”People have seen the progressive and visionary approach of BJP government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Centre for the last 16 months and they are yearning to replicate the same model in Bihar,” he was quoted as saying in an official press release. Singh said, facts, figures and statistics distinctly stand out to indicate that whatever rise in growth rate and other parameters has been achieved by India in the last few years, it is primarily through the contribution of BJP ruled states. ”This is something that the young campaigners of ABVP are expected to explain to their peers and age-mates who are not well versed with the ideology and vision of BJP ‘Sanghathan’. ”Who, in Bihar, would not like to have a ‘Vyavastha’ or an administrative structure like the one that exists, for example, in Madhya Pradesh or Gujarat or Chhattisgarh,” he asked. \n 21 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:16:54.387+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
