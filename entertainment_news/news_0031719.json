J. Daulerio, and Heather Dietrick, for any data, files, emails, messages, texts, phone records and similar electronically stored information concerning the Plaintiff, Terry Bollea, in this action and including the U. S. District Court case of Gawker Media v. FBI (“FOIA” lawsuit), for the time frame of June 26, 2015, through August 6, 2015.”\nHogan wants access to the correspondence because he believes Gawker leaked a recording of him making a 2006 racist rant to the National Enquirer. It is the latest court ruling in relation to Hogan's $100 million lawsuit against Gawker Media for publishing a video recording of him having sex on one of its web sites.\nGawker's lawyers disagreed with the ruling and will appeal. Attorney Michael Berry said in a statement to FOX411: “The Judge’s order is literally unprecedented. It has no basis in law or fact. We intend to appeal. This order should send a shiver down the spine of all media companies and anyone who believes in the free press. It says that a court can confiscate all data in a media companies’ computer system based on nothing more than a baseless hunch and accusation. It then gives a litigant all reporters’ and editor’s data that mentions his name and a long list of other names. This order is an affront to the First Amendment.”\nHogan’s lawyer told FOX411 in July that he was suspicious of who leaked Hogan's rant, which went viral and led to the former reality star getting fired by the WWE.\n“I have my suspicions, as you can imagine,” Houston told FOX411. “If I can find out it is Gawker who leaked the transcripts, we will bury them.”\nMore on this...
