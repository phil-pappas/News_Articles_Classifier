AC Lens , the largest Halloween contact lenses retailer, is offering a powerful palette of over 100 FDA-approved contact lenses to transform any costume into a dramatic, one-of-a-kind look.\n\" Halloween is an opportunity to get creative, have fun and really go all out with your costume so that your friends are inspired and impressed,\" said Erin Williams , a top New York make-up artist with a wide range of celebrity, TV and theatre experience, and owner of Erin's Faces. \"Attention to detail is key to having an impact, and your eyes can make you stand out. Halloween contact lenses are the ultimate accessory to elevate any costume from ho-hum to vibrant and fun.\"\nFor Erin, the keys to Halloween contacts are a wide selection of colors and styles and being able to imagine how the lenses look on you. She trusts AC Lens for its extensive selection, including Zombie Yellow , Black Out , Walking Dead and Angelic White .\nSafety is another crucial consideration when buying Halloween contact lenses. Eye injuries caused by non-FDA-approved lenses are well-documented, and a recent Korean study published in the British Journal of Ophthalmology found that non-prescription color contact lenses may impair vision. The study emphasized the importance of seeing an eye care professional to insure proper fit and safe contact lens materials before making a purchase.\n\"Many people go to mom-and-pop costume stores or flea markets for Halloween contact lenses, and that really is more trick than treat for unsuspecting shoppers,\" said Bob Drumm , marketing director for AC Lens. \"Safety without sacrificing style is our number one priority for Halloween , and all year round. Our easy process for finding the right pair – visiting the eye doctor, getting a prescription for proper fit, and then selecting from our wide selection of FDA-approved lenses – is easy and safe, and insures your eyes will feel as great as they look.\"\nAnd as long as Halloween contacts are properly acquired, the possibilities are endless! Erin Williams shares some of her favorite Halloween looks for glasses and contact wearers:\nVampire – A dramatic dark eye, pale skin, a red lip and New Moon contacts will make a statement! Butterfly Fairy – Playful butterfly wings, eye make-up that incorporates colors from the wings and Rave Blue contacts will transform anyone into a sweet fairy. Holly Golightly – An easy glam look, just throw your hair into a bun, grab a pearl necklace, a black dress, and add some cat-eye sunglasses. Mother of Dragons – With a blond wig, Night Vixen contacts , and ethereal make-up, you can channel your inner Daenerys. To help navigate the wide selection of lenses available at AC Lens, Williams recommends sorting by color. She advises, \"You want the lenses to pop against the rest of your look, so consider your eye make-up, skin tone and hair color to make sure the lenses really stand out.\"\nFor more information, and to browse the extensive collection of Halloween contact lenses, visit AC Lens online .\nAbout AC Lens\nAC Lens was established in 1996 and is currently one of the largest online optical retailers in the USA .
