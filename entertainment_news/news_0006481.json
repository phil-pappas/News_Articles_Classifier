A beautiful, quintessentially English, tranquil backdrop. Perfect for picnics… and murder!”\n– Robson Green, Actor 'Supporting actors' who all live in Grantchester Credit: ITV News Anglia \"The villagers are so welcoming and they are so proud of this place. You can see why. It’s a lovely, beautiful little village.\"\n– James Norton, Actor Tessa Peake-Jones, Kacey Ainsworth and Al Weaver are back and actors Neil Morrissey and Paul Nicholls are joining the cast.\nProducer Emma Kingsman-Lloyd said the themes would be “a little darker” this series, as Sidney and Geordie disagree about moral questions like the death penalty.\nProducers have commissioned a headstone to be erected in Grantchester churchyard for the filming.\nIt marks the grave of one of the characters but which one? That will remain a mystery until the drama is aired next year.\nWatch Claire McGlasson's report below.\nPlay video Last updated Thu 15 Oct 2015 Read more 2 updates Cameras roll for second series of Grantchester Entertainment Cambridgeshire cambridge", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:37:47.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
