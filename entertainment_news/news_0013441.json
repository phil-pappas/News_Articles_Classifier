Art review: Snite lithography exhibit balances between tradition and experimentalism By Evan Gillespie Tribune Correspondent   \nA small new exhibit currently up at the Snite Museum of Art means to provide a concise look at the history of lithography over the past hundred years or so, but it effectively does much more than that. \nBeyond illustrating for us how artists of the 20th and 21st centuries chose to approach one particular printmaking technique, the show encourages us to think about the ways in which artists struggled to define themselves and their art in an era when traditions were dissolving quickly around them. \nIntended as a sequel to last fall’s “Rock-Paper …” exhibit, which presented lithography of the 19th century, this second part of “Rock-Paper …” focuses on lithographic prints made after the turn of the 20th century, as the technique allowed for a trend toward the democratization of art. In the 1930s, the Works Progress Administration employed artists and distributed their prints widely, and commercial studios mass-produced and marketed prints to a broad, middle-class audience, a development that is represented here. \nMore interesting than the history of lithographic marketing, though, is the clash of tradition with postmodernism that underlies many of the prints in the show. The conflict is made clear — humorously so — by the inclusion of a print by Robert Rauschenberg. Rauschenberg famously declared his anti-traditionalism early on, when he said that “the second half of the twentieth century is no time to start writing on rocks,” a sneering suggestion that the primitive medium of lithography had no place in the future of art. But after Rauschenberg discovered that his knee-jerk iconoclasm kept him from exploring an extremely versatile medium, he went on to become one of the 20th century’s most productive lithographers, testimony to the mid-century confusion over the proper path for art to take into the future. \nLithography itself may have helped fuel that confusion. The technique, thanks to its use, literally, of stones in its process, feels ancient despite its relative youth among artistic media, and for some artists, that air of venerability seems to have suggested that lithographs should hew close to tradition. Jean Louis Forain’s “Among the New Rich” reaches back more than a half century to the heyday of irreverent political cartoonists, and Max Beckman’s “The Dice Throwers Under the Cross” evokes the Baroque darkness of Rembrandt’s etchings. \nThe unexpected traditionalism of 20th-century lithographers is particularly striking in a print such as Matisse’s “Sleeping Nude With Louis XIV Screen.” In painting, Matisse did not hesitate to dismantle every tradition he could get his hands on, but here he does nothing to challenge the rules of perspective, anatomy, composition or color; his nude is nearly Classical in her conservatism. \nOf course, some Modernists were not to be deterred in their quest for something new, and in lithography they found a doorway into unexplored territory. Perhaps inspired by the simplistic and tactile process of drawing on a stone with a grease pencil, Picasso regressed to childlike doodling; his “In Picasso’s Studio” is a colorful and uninhibited sketch, and it attempts to bring a child’s lack of restraint to thoughtful fine art. \nAside from the questions of tradition in a time of turmoil, the show also traces the progression of lithography from an art historical perspective. There is the populist work of Thomas Hart Benton and the bold graphic design of Robert Indiana — his “South Bend” has local significance — to trace lithography’s development as the medium of the masses, and there is contemporary work such as Renée Stout’s “Marie Laveau” to claim lithography’s legitimate place among the layered media that fill the 21st-century artist’s toolbox. \nTaken together with the first installment of the exhibit, in which lithography was cast in the role of scrappy newcomer, this second half of the show presents a medium with a much more complex personality, one that balances on the boundary between solid tradition and upstart experimentalism.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T08:04:38.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
