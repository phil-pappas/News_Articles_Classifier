The singer debuted earlier this week \"Hollow\" to follow her hits like \"Nobody Love\" and \"Should've Been Us\". Kelly later unveiled a lyric video for the emotional mid-tempo track, on which she describes herself as \"hollow\" that only needs love to \"fill up my cup.\" She sings, \"Cause I'm fragile And you know this/ So hold me/ Wrap me in love, fill up my cup/ Empty and only your love can fill up my cup/ Cause I'm hollow.\" \" 'Hollow' for me, is very directly connected to me and my faith - it's like my love song to God,\" Kelly said when premiering the song on Z100. \"I tried to fill that hole with a bunch of only things, and I just know that Jesus is the only one that can fill it.\" Continuing her breakout year, Kelly will appear at the upcoming 2015 MTV Europe Music Awards. She's scheduled to perform alongside Andrea Bocelli during the event, which is airing live from Milan this weekend. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:44:15.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
