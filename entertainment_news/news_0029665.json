Promoted stories \nIn a first for The X Factor, the public had their say as to the categories each judge would be mentoring. BBC Radio 1′s Nick Grimshaw is in charge of the Boys, while Cheryl Fernandez-Versini heads up the Groups. \nTV mogul Simon Cowell threw a strop and swore out loud after being handed the Overs. “Oh, f***! Are you winding me up?” he said, before asking if the right name was called out. Kiera Weathers on stage in the Six Chair Challenge (Thames/Syco) \nTensions erupted into a spat between Simon and the Girls mentor Rita following Katie Coleman’s rendition of Christina Aguilera’s The Voice Within. \n“You were better the first time, but if it was me, I would give you a chair,” the X Factor supremo told the 21-year-old. The crowd believed he liked the performance and cheered. \nHowever, he added: “Not one of those. I’d give you a chair at home. I don’t think it was good enough.” Katie Coleman singing in the Six Chair Challenge (Thames TV/Syco) \nRita fired back: “That was just rude. Simon, if you would just like to mind your own business and wait until your category comes up.” \nHowever, she decided not to give the Darlington contestant a chair. \nAnother misfire on the night was 23-year-old Kelly Mai Webb, who was woefully off-key with her version of Patti Smith’s Because The Night. The Blackpool hopeful’s X Factor dream came to a swift end.
