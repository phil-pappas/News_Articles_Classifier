The music will fill an eclectic mix of venues set along the white quartz sand beaches of Perdido Key, Pensacola and the Alabama-Florida Gulf Coast. Named a “Top 20 Event” in the Southeast, the Frank Brown International Songwriters' Festival brings the world’s most beloved songs—from iconic classics to today’s biggest hits—to life, with spontaneous jams, raw storytelling, and songs performed by the songwriters who created them. This year’s line-up includes more than 200 songwriters, including the iconic Dean Dillon (“Tennessee Whiskey,” “The Breath You Take,” “The Chair;” Chris Wallin (“Love Me If You Can,” “Don’t Blink,” “Honky Tonk Badonkadonk);” Bob Regan (“Dig Two Graves,” “Your Everything,” “Something About a Woman,”) and Scotty Emerick (“I Don’t Believe in Goodbye,” “’Round Here,” “As Good as I Once Was,” to name just a few.\nThirty thousand music lovers will converge upon the Flora-Bama Lounge & Package , the festival's \"ground zero,\" to catch as many concerts as possible—most are free although a few charge a small cover. The music covers a wide variety of genres, with a heavy accent on country music.\nOne of the biggest events will be held Nov. 14 at the Flora-Bama, when Dillon, Emerick and other well-known singer-songwriters will perform a tribute to Hank Cochran, a star performer himself as well as the author of songs for such legendary artists as Patsy Cline, Ray Price and Eddy Arnold.\nThe Frank Brown International Songwriters Festival is named for a beloved former night watchman at the Flora-Bama. It’s a featured part of the Pensacola Foo Foo Festival , a series of shows and other events that make November in Pensacola a popular attraction for travelers. FBISF is a flagship event of the Pensacola Foo Foo Festival (foofoofest.com).\nFor a complete list of concert venues and schedules, visit fbisf.com.\n# # #\nAbout Visit Pensacola\nVisit Pensacola leads the effort of economic development through tourism in Escambia County, Fla.
