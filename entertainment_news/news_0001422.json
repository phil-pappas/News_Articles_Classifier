Martin \nVariety Staff Thursday, October 01, 2015 12:38 AM EDT | Updated: Thursday, October 01, 2015 12:47 AM EDT Co-executive producer George R.R. Martin arrives for the season premiere of HBO's \"Game of Thrones\" in San Francisco, California March 23, 2015. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith 'Game of Thrones' casts Richard E. Grant for Season 6 \nLOS ANGELES - The Internet, much like the night, is dark and full of terrors, which means rumors sometimes get blown out of proportion. Such is the case with a tabloid report claiming that HBO is working on a \"Game of Thrones\" movie, with quotes attributed to author George R.R. Martin that seemingly confirm the news. \nAccording to the U.K.'s Daily Star , Martin was quoted as saying, \"There will be a movie but I will not be involved. I have too much to do. That is something HBO and DB [Weiss] and David [Benioff] are dealing with. I have two more books to finish and I still have so much to do. The pressure is on. I am such a slow writer and the fans get upset that I don't write faster.\" An anonymous source was also said to have suggested to the tabloid that the film would adapt a storyline outside the main narrative, such as Robert Baratheon's uprising against The Mad King Aerys Targaryen: \"They are looking at dipping back in time during certain periods of the series, which could be examined as a one off plot. That means that some of the big characters who fans have seen die on screen could be resurrected such as Robb Stark, Catelyn Stark, Oberyn Martell The Red Viper - and Ned Stark.\" \nSadly for eager \"Thrones\" fans, Martin took to his personal Livejournal to debunk the scuttlebutt , responding to a commenter, \"Yes, completely false. No one is working on any movie just now. And if there was a movie, it would not be about Robert's Rebellion.\" \nThe Huffington Post contacted Martin's assistant, who reportedly said that the statements attributed to the author in the Daily Star article are \"not direct quotes.\" \nHuffPost also obtained a statement from Martin regarding the movie: \"There's been talk about it. I'd love to see one, but nothing is decided.\" \nDiscussion about a potential \"Thrones\" movie has circulated since the series debuted, and Martin previously addressed the speculation earlier this year. \"I see that this new crop of stories also raises, once again, the notion of concluding the series with one or more feature films. And in some of these stories, once again, this idea is wrongly attributed to me. Let me state, yet again, that while I love this idea, it did NOT originate with me. It was a notion suggested to me, which I have enthusiastically endorsed. Sure, I love the idea. Why not? What fantasist would not love the idea of going out with an epic hundred million feature film? And the recent success of the Imax experience shows that the audience is there for such a movie. If we build it, they will come. But will we build it? I have no bloody idea.\" \nHBO President of Programming Michael Lombardo had a different opinion, however -- at least about concluding the current series with a feature film: \"When you start a series with our subscribers, the promise is that for your HBO fee that we're going to take you to the end of this. I feel that on some level [a movie would be] changing the rules: Now you have to pay $16 to see how your show ends.\" \n\"Game of Thrones\" returns to HBO in 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T07:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T11:06:07.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
