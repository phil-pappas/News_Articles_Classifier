Buffalo-based M&T Bank, which employs about 450 in Rochester and operates 31 area branches, said net operating income was $283 million in its third quarter of 2015, up from $275 million a year earlier. Earnings per share were $1.93 in its most recent quarter, up from $1.91 a year earlier.\nHowever, those results missed Wall Street's expectations of $2.01. Shares closed down nearly 3 percent, or $3.48, to $113.52.\n\"Significantly, year over year revenues were up and expenses were down, and our credit quality remained strong,\" said Ren√© F. Jones, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, in a statement, who added that results were \"dampened by a slowdown in mortgage loan origination activities that depressed both residential and commercial mortgage banking revenues.\"\nMortgage-related banking revenues were down 10 percent compared to a year earlier, falling from about $93.5 million in 2014 to approximately $84 million in the most recent quarter, according to M&T's balance sheet. Savings in operating expenses were lower due to decreased costs for professional services, which were partially offset by higher salaries and employee benefit expenses, the bank said.\nThe bank also increased by 52 percent its provision for credit losses, an allowance to offset anticipated losses, from $29 million in the third quarter of 2014 to $44 million in its most recent quarter. M&T also said it is moving toward completing its acquisition of New Jersey-based Hudson City, expected to be on or about Nov. 1. The deal has received regulatory approval.\nTCLAUSEN@Gannett.com\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nState regulators approve M&T deal for Hudson City", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/46d729d8f3d768b717d4a020d4552b4eef49b4a8/c=66-0-467-401/local/-/media/2015/10/04/Rochester/B9319069511Z.1_20151004200929_000_GARC3DA23.1-0.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T19:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:06:16.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
