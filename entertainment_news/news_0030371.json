The Netflix spin-off has cast three young actors to play DJ Tanner's ( Candace Cameron Bure) and Kimmy Gibbler's (Andrea Barber) kids. DJ's older son Jackson will be played by Michael Campion, while fellow newcomer Elias Harger will play DJ's younger son Max. She also has an infant son. According to E! News, Jackson \"is having a hard time coping with the loss of his father, breaking rules and stirring up some trouble. He takes after Uncle Jesse ( John Stamos ) in that he plays guitar and is a bit of a ladies' man.\" Max is described as \"very smart and curious about the world, and takes after his grandpa Danny ( Bob Saget ).\" Meanwhile, Kimmy's half-Hispanic daughter Ramona will be portrayed by Soni Nicole Bringas. She \"blames her mom for breaking up with her dad.\" Bure recently gushed about the actors playing her on-screen children, \"They are so good, they are so funny. Casting did a really, really good job. And they went on a very big wide search for these kids, and they came up with winners!\" Of her character DJ, she said, \"She's in mom mode, full-time. She's not a teenager anymore, but she's still really fun. She also has to keep her boys under control without a husband, so she's got to be a disciplinarian.\" The \"Full House\" spin-off will center on the recently widowed DJ and her three kids, along with her sister Stephanie ( Jodie Sweetin ) and neighbor Kimmy. The new series will be preceded by a one-hour reunion that reunites original stars including Stamos, Saget, Dave Coulier and Scott Weinger. Weinger recently shared a picture of him getting kissed by co-star Bure. Weinger's character Steve was DJ's high school boyfriend on the original series.
