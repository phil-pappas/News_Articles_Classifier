Many people took to social media to deride Connell's lawsuit.\n\"She would never do anything to hurt the family or myself,\" Tarala told NBC's Today show.\nConnell said the matter was a misunderstanding and that she had to name the boy in a lawsuit intended to ensure that insurance covered her treatment.\n\"This was simply a case of formality with an insurance claim,\" Connell said. \"I said at the start of this, 'I don't understand why. I don't want to sue Sean.'\"\nConnell testified that when the boy jumped on her they fell to the ground as she tried to catch him. She testified that the injury has made it difficult to walk up the stairs in her Manhattan apartment building, and that her social life has been negatively impacted.\nThe boy's mother died last year.\n(Reporting by Scott Malone; Editing by Will Dunham)\n- Reuters\nEmail More", "external_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=#&title=&summary=&source="], "published": "2015-10-16T05:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:10:22.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
