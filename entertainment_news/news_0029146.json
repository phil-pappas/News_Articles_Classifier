He was in the seat he always seems to get, 22A, on a cramped 50-seat regional jet. Two people...\n(Gregory Karp) But he served on the United board of directors that implicitly sanctioned the airline's almost pathological corner-cutting under his predecessor Jeff Smisek. While that grew market cap and profits, it also eroded quality and service, alienating both loyal customers and employees.\nWhile working in finance with Coca-Cola, Pepsi and AT&T, Munoz said he came to recognize that the product matters as much as the balance sheet. It costs you if consumer loyalty and brand quality are squandered on a lousy product.\nUnited passengers will remember Smisek as the guy in the in-flight videos who kept telling them how great things were going since the merger five years ago with his Continental Airlines.\nIt apparently never occurred to him that passengers might trust their own impressions and experiences.\nSo part of Munoz's job in the early going — though he didn't say it so bluntly — is to reassure customers and employees that United knows they're not idiots.\n\"It's important that we recognize the fact that this integration — this merger and all the respective nature of it — has not gone as well as it could,\" Munoz said. \"We just have to lay this out for the folks because for a long period of time (the) company's tended to sort of be defensive and try to suggest or inform or convince others that despite their personal experiences that, 'No, no, no, we are getting better.'\"\nThat said, the board's metrics were aligned with Smisek's, which is why neither United nor Munoz, who served on Smisek's board at Continental too, paid heed to the dark clouds of the company's own making on the horizon.\nThe company performance directors and top executives focused on didn't mesh with the company performance customers expected.\n\"We've allowed the benefits of the merger and integration to be discussed and felt and, to some degree, be rewarded at the top of the food chain,\" Munoz conceded.\nSmisek risked being run out of town on a baggage cart by disgruntled travelers and disenfranchised workers, each group almost as bitter as the coffee United took to serving in another money-saving move. But Smisek always had the board behind him.\nHe only resigned because he somehow managed to get swept into an investigation of New Jersey political corruption and he may well wind up with millions of dollars as a parting thank you.\n\"The market cap of the company has increased, the financial viability and the strength of the company has benefited,\" Munoz said of Smisek's United tenure. \"So personally speaking, not speaking for the board, you see that improving sort of financial margin and you say, 'OK, great, we're having some financial benefit.'\"\nNot even Smisek's board could ignore United's poor on-time performance, the result not only of bad weather but also controllable factors such as outdated technology and ham-fisted labor management.\n\"We were already engaged with regards to that, and so I was not completely unaware of some of the need,\" Munoz said. \"But nevertheless, again, the company is in a much better financial state, so maybe (as a board member) I wasn't as focused.\"\nCatering to the people who buy shares wholly at the expense of the people who buy tickets is just as foolish and unsustainable as completely ignoring shareholder concerns.\n\"It's the human approach to customers that I want to bring back but do it ... This is the trick: Do it in a margin neutral, margin accretive way because it has to benefit our shareholders as well,\" Munoz said. \"I'm going to have to strike this delicate balance between all the different constituencies.\"\nMunoz's admission that United requires a course correction was, like so many of its flights, long overdue. Who knows if he can pull it off?\nHad United's board paid closer attention, asked more questions and demanded more from leadership, much of this might have been avoided. A few flights in coach for directors and top executives might have helped create a sense of urgency.\nBut airlines aren't the only ones that can act as if they are soaring when simultaneously digging a hole for themselves, potentially resulting in a very rough landing.\nphilrosenthal@tribpub.com\nTwitter @phil_rosenthal\n Business The Coca-Cola Company Phil Rosenthal", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-560ec336/turbine/ct-united-airlines-munoz-1004-biz-20151002", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560f03e3/turbine/ct-rosenthal-united-oscar-munoz-1004-biz-20151002"], "published": "2015-10-03T00:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:10:07.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
