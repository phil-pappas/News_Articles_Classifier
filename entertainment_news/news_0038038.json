While their fashions are classy and sophisticated like Olivia Pope from 'Scandal\" wears, you can find them here in North Baltimore for a quarter to a third of the price Pope pays. \nWhether you want to accent a skirt with a stylish wrap like Good Morning Maryland's Ashley James is sporting, or be glammed from head to toe like Pope on her way to a state dinner, the owner of the Boutique says they have all the big names from Anthropology to Chanel. \nThey even got the goods to cover up that fancy outfit. Ponchos in every shape and color. You could almost credit Olivia Pope for making ponchos return to the scene. \nShe's wearing at least one an episode, but instead of paying thousands for yours, you can find one at La Chic for a fraction of the price.
