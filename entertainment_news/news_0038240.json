In 2005, Michael Maglaras and Terri Templeton released their first film “Cleophas and His Own”, taken from the American Modernist painter Marsden Hartley's epic narrative of love and loss, a private and personal narrative which was first published many years after his death. In “Cleophas and His Own,” Maglaras both directed and played the role of Hartley. In 2008, 217 Films’ second release was the first-ever documentary film on the life of Hartley called “Visible Silence: Marsden Hartley, Painter and Poet.” In 2010, with their film “John Marin: Let the Paint be Paint!” they established, through the first documentary made about this important painter, that John Marin was one of the fathers of American Modernism.\nAmong other distinctions, these films have been shown to acclaim at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. In 2012, in honor of the re-publication by the Library of America of the six seminal graphic novels of the American master Lynd Ward, they released the film “O Brother Man: The Art and Life of Lynd Ward.” mCelebrating the 100th anniversary of the art exhibition that introduced Modernism to America, in September 2013 “The Great Confusion: The 1913 Armory Show” was produced. Their sixth film “Enough to Live On: The Art of the WPA” was released in May 2015 in celebration of the 80th anniversary of the Federal Art Project under Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal.\nThe Sacramento Bee called Michael Maglaras a filmmaker of “Bergman-like gravitas.” His films have been described as “virtuoso filmmaking” (National Gallery of Art) “alive and fresh” (Art New England) “elegiac and insightful” (Naples Daily News) and “unforgettable” (Journal of American History). David Berona, author of “Wordless Books” said “O Brother Man” “is stunning” and Judith Regan of Sirius XM called it “magnificent.” A review in The Dartmouth said of “The Great Confusion” that “Michael Maglaras...brought the drama of the original show back to life.” Scott Whipple of the New Britain Herald said, “Maglaras and Templeton’s work is comparable to that of the widely acclaimed Ken Burns.\" Maglaras was recently featured in a full-length interview on “Conversations from Penn State” on Public Television.\nhttp://www.two17films.com\n###", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly92aW1lby5jb20vdHdvMTdmaWxtcw==", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3R3bzE3ZmlsbXNzY2hlZHVsZS5ibG9nc3BvdC5jb20=", "https://vimeo.com/two17films", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy50d28xN2ZpbG1zLmNvbQ=="], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T15:09:57.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
