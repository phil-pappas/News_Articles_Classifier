Dempsey returned to Maine for the two-day, bike-and-run fundraiser that started after his racing team’s victory at the “Six Hours of Fuji” endurance race in Japan. About 4,000 people were participating in the challenge. The goal is to break the 2014 record of $1.41 million raised by 3,871 participants, said Aimee Arsenault Labbe, the Dempsey Center’s manager of special events and development.
