Even for Adele. Especially for Adele, perhaps. \nThat seems to be the message of Hello, the first single off her forthcoming album 25. Due Nov. 20, the British singer’s wildly anticipated third full-length comes four years after the commercial juggernaut of her breakup album 21, a disc that moved 30 million copies and earned her seven Grammys, including Album of the Year, Record of the Year and Song of the Year. \nNot surprisingly, Adele and her new producer Greg Kurstin aren’t exactly reinventing her money-spinning wheel with Hello. Not to be confused with the Lionel Richie classic — though it didn’t take long for some smartypants to splice them together into an Internet mashup meme — this Hello is a big, lush, bombastic ballad about an apparently successful woman trying to get in touch with an old lover to apologize for breaking his heart and leaving him behind. \nFrom the lyrics — and the accompanying sepia-toned video, which depicts her roaming around an empty house, sifting through old papers and romantically reminiscing between phone calls — it’s hard to tell what’s become of the object of her attempts at reconciliation. Is he still ticked? Has he moved on to another love? Is he simply ignoring her? Is he dead? Does he just have lousy coverage? \nOnly Adele might know for sure. And she isn’t telling. But she does keep trying. “Hello from the other side,” she sings repeatedly on the swelling chorus, unleashing those force-of-nature pipes. “I must’ve called a thousand times to tell you I’m sorry for everything that I’ve done. But when I call you never seem to be home … It clearly doesn’t tear you apart anymore.” \nThat is more than you can say for the millions of fans who are already losing it over the track, which seems to suggest that 25 could be every bit as emotionally cathartic and commercially unstoppable as its predecessor. \nYou have five weeks to stock up on chardonnay, bubble bath and candles. Consider yourself warned. \nTwitter: @darryl_sterdan", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:55:41.537+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
