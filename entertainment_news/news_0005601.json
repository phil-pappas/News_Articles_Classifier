The hop-on, hop-off shuttle has six stops in the district, as well as a stop at the Transportation Center Garage.\n“We want to be able to actually move customers around the district so they can experience multiple business in the district,” said Michael Martin, president of the Oregon District Business Association.\nParking has become a problem over the years as the Oregon District’s first-floor retail occupancy rate grew to more than 95%.\n“It’s been difficult for my patrons on Friday and Saturday evenings, and during the week,” Jay’s Seafood Restaurant owner Amy Haverstick told this paper back in July when the program had not yet been approved. “The parking lot fills up very quickly.”\nEmployees at Oregon District businesses will get to park for free at the Transportation Center Garage.\nThe Oregon District Business association has partnered with The Downtown Dayton Partnership, City of Dayton, ABM Parking Services, and Citywide Development Corp. to offer the parking and shuttle program.\nDrivers said they didn’t want to park at the Convention Center and walk under a dark bridge, which is why the groups are offering a shuttle, though “that bridge is now all very well lit and the garage is well lit,” according to Downtown Dayton Partnership President Sandy Gudorf.\nJulie Eisenhauer said she’s interested in using the new program.\n“I wouldn’t have to spend 10 minutes following people to their cars when they’re about to leave,” she said.\nThe discounted parking and free shuttle is available Friday and Saturday from 5 p.m. to 1 a.m.\nThe Oregon District Business Association will pay $35,000 annually for the shuttle, but they hope to find a sponsor.\nStaff writer Kate Bartley contributed to this report.\nMore News From Our News Partners Father learns to walk again so he can take daughter down the aisle on her wedding day Koko the gorilla receives kittens for 44th birthday Man gets 5 years for showercam, says it was for watching chickens Man crushed by 16-pound pine cone sues park for $5 million Mark Hamill denies flubbing Star Wars lines", "external_links": ["http://host.coxmediagroup.com/cop/digital/sites/common/js/cmgo_right_rail_addons.js\\", "http://www.wpxi.com/news/news/national/man-crushed-16-pound-pinecone-sues-park-5-million/nn3xj/", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/908/img/photos/2015/10/15/75/e8/101615\\u002Dfree\\u002Dshuttle\\u002D001.jpg", "http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js", "http://www.krmg.com/news/news/national/man-gets-5-years-showercam-says-it-was-watching-ch/nn3wy/", "http://www.kirotv.com/news/news/national/father-learns-walk-again-so-he-can-take-daughter-d/nn394/", "http://www.wftv.com/news/entertainment/movies/did-he-or-didnt-he-mark-hamill-denies-flubbing-sta/nn322/", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:15:39.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
