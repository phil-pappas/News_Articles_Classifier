Since then, she has released individual tracks including \"FourFiveSeconds,\" a collaboration with rapper Kanye West and Beatles legend Paul McCartney.\nBut her public image is also marked by her troubled past relationship with rapper Chris Brown, who was convicted in 2009 of beating her.\nRihanna, whose performance at the 2009 Grammys was canceled after the assault, said in an interview published in the latest edition of Vanity Fair that she had stayed with Brown in hopes of changing him.\n\"I was very protective of him. I felt that people didn't understand him,\" Rihanna told the magazine.\n\"But you know, you realize after a while that in that situation you're the enemy,\" she said.\n\"You want the best for them, but if you remind them of their failures, or if you remind them of bad moments in their life, or even if you say I'm willing to put up with something, they think less of you -- because they know you don't deserve what they're going to give.\"\nArts & Entertainment Music Rihanna", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T07:58:05.398+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
