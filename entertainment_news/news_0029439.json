News and TMZ report, and will give their relationship another shot. The pair signed divorce papers in July but a judge hadn't yet signed off on it when the former NBA star was found unconscious at a Nevada brothel.\nAccording to E!, the 31-year-old Kardashian's attorney Laura Wasser went to court Wednesday morning to ask a judge to withdraw their divorce petition. The judge granted the petition and the divorce is officially off.\nThe \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" star has been with her husband since he was found face down and unresponsive by two prostitutes after an apparent drug overdose. Odom, 35, has since come out of a coma and been transferred to a Los Angeles hospital where he's being treated for aspiration pneumonia and is expected to require months to recover.\n\"Every day he is getting a bit better, but he is continuing to have extensive tests on his cognitive and motor functions, so no one can make a definitive diagnosis yet,\" an insider said. \"He is more coherent day by day.\"\nKardashian first filed for divorce in December 2013, but waited until this past summer to pursue it as she hoped to get Odom into rehab, according to TMZ. She started dating current NBA star James Harden this year, but appears to have quickly ended their relationship.", "external_links": ["http://www.eonline.com/news/708755/khloe-kardashian-and-lamar-odom-calling-off-divorce", "http://www.tmz.com/2015/10/21/khloe-karsashian-lamar-odom-divorce/"], "published": "2015-10-22T04:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:14:59.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
