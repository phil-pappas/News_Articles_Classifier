And we were sort of in a situation of thinking that we’re not because of society. So we are hiding the other side of ourselves, which is less acceptable.

[Lennon] just didn’t want to do it, I think. I think he had a desire to [sleep with men], but I think he was too inhibited.\"\nRead the full interview here .\nMORE: Only 2,000 people showed up for Yoko Ono's 'human peace sign' record attempt yesterday\nMORE: Yoko Ono is organising the world's biggest human peace sign for John Lennon's 75th birthday\nMORE: Pics: Bono and The Edge appear with Yoko Ono in New York and claim John Lennon as Irish", "external_links": ["http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/10/13/yoko-ono-i-still-fear-lennon-s-killer.html", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/lOzqg1Z8rTU"], "published": "2015-10-14T20:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T15:53:23.654+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
