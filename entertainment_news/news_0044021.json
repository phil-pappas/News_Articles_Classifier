The Robertsons, whose family and business making duck calls are featured on the A&E reality show, are now stepping down the runway into mainstream fashion, according to The Daily Advertiser.\nThe move is not unusual, given daughter Sadie Robertson's own line of \"daddy approved\" prom dresses with Sherri Hill or the Robertson matriarchs' partnership for branded Dooney & Bourke bags.\nThe newspaper reports that the family invited about 40 fans to a private unveiling at their home in Monroe, and images shared on social media show casual clothing items like plaid and camouflage shirts, denim and various accessories.\nClick here to read the original story from The Daily Advertiser.\n#commanderlife #duckcommander #dcsuperfan .
