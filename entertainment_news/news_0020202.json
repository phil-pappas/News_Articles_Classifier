On Saturday, Big Brother Canada is auditioning the biggest and boldest personalities in Canada to star in its fourth season, airing on Global TV in winter 2016, in an open Toronto casting call.\nIf you think you have what it takes to outsmart and outplay one of Canada’s most popular games, head over to The Citizen from 9 a.m to 1 p.m.to test for iconic casting director Robyn Kass. Also in attendance will be a gaggle of last season’s stars, including BB Can 2 winner Jon Pardy and the reigning champ, Sarah Hanlon.\nPostmedia Network caught up with the proud stoner who took home the $100K prize this past spring to chat hot topics, find out if she’s spent all her winnings yet, sound off on ‘green politics’ and dissect how the game has evolved over the years.\n2015 was quite the year for you. From winning BB Can 3, to hosting your own BB 17 talk show on Global.com to now helping the casting process for BB Can 4!\nIt was the Big Brother year, absolutely. It’s my new life. I’m in the BB family -- and I’m going to exploit it as much as possible! I have a pop culture show Mondays at 7 p.m. at Vapour Lounge in Toronto, too. It's called The Sarah Hanlon Show and I'm the host. We have special guests every week and great giveaways! It's a 18+ marijuana lounge where people bring their own bud and can smoke in any way they prefer!\nAs a weed activist, what do you think of prime minister-designate’s plan to legalize marijuana?\nI love the Liberal majority win and the party’s stance of marijuana. The Green Party has, of course, been advocating this for years, but I'm just thrilled that this became a possibility. It makes me sick when people say it's a non-issue. Tell that to the people who can't get access to their medicines, who are addicted to terrible prescription drugs, and who are in jail for a plant that over 40% of the population consumes at least once a year. The possibilities and opportunities legalization can open up for the economy and the job market are endless. I'm excited, but as activists we have to keep fighting to make sure this whole process is done right, like in Colorado where they are making a killing in taxation of marijuana.\nYou were very open about your marijuana use during Big Brother. Did you receive any backlash when you returned to real life?\nI was nervous about there being a negative impact. However, there has been nothing but love. I hope I helped people to see that \"potheads\" are not these stereotypical portrayals you see on TV. It's amazing the wide range of people who appreciated my being so open on the show about a lot of stuff.\nHave you put this year in perspective yet despite your busy schedule?\nI have! I realize how lucky I was. I tell myself every day to soak it all in and enjoy it. I can’t believe it’s been a year since I applied; and that people are applying for season four now. You go through the ups and downs of being on Big Brother, but it’s the best experience of my life.\nHave you run through your money yet?\nThank God, no. But I have dipped into my Brick gift certificate, I’ll say that much. I got a big new curve TV.\nDo you think the relatively mediocre prize money should increase for both the American and Canadian franchises?\nYes. Look at Amazing Race Canada’s prizes; it’s almost a million dollars. BB Can spends a lot of money on our competitions, but yes, I think the prize should be bigger for being locked in a house for three months.\nWould you do The Amazing Race? Even though that’s unlikely since it airs on Global TV’s rival, CTV?\nYes. My partner Scott and I talk about it all the time. I’d also go with my former BB co-stars Brittnee [Blair,] Willow [MacDonald], or even Graig [Merritt] and Bruno [Lelo].\nLet’s talk about sexism in the BB game: why aren’t there more female winners in the U.S. version? The only time a woman has beat a man is on the Canadian franchise. And out of three seasons, BB Canada boasts two female victors.\nCanada is much different than the American version. Here, our difference brings us together. Big Brother is a game of perception and how you’re perceived. If you’re a young, sexy quarterback, you’re going to have an easier time to get people to respect and trust you. You see it in real life, politics and society. Big Brother is microcosm of life, so in a way Big Brother US is doing its job by showing us that sexism is alive and well south of the border.\nAll-female alliances are practically impossible to form, but you managed to create a successful one with Brittnee.\nI’m proud of that.\nWhy do men freak out when they hear there might be an all-girl alliance forming while they’re in an all-male alliance? Why isn’t an all-male alliance scary?\nI know! We need to unlearn psychological traps society teaches us about who will protect us and stay loyal to us. For women, we’re taught we need men. Look at how popular Disney’s fairy tales are. Because you’re so insecure in that house, you tend to see women leaning on men and rely on these built-in tropes we’ve been taught to feel secure with. I tried a larger all-girl alliance, but there wasn’t that much genuine interest there. I think with more female role models, like Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Schumer, speaking out and demanding gender equality that things will change.\nThe main discussion this season on BB 17 was regarding whether or not Vanessa Rousso was the best female player in history. Do we ever talk about who is the best male player in history? Why wasn’t the conversation: is she one of the best all-time players?\nI know! [Sighs] We only categorize and rank men as overall players, but women are a subset of players. Is the worst male player better than the best female player?\nWomen are truly the last minority.\nAnd then you have women who are more than one minority, like black or gay women.\nFloaters get a bad rap. Why?\nI don’t get it. There’s a difference between floating, which I did from time to time, and being oblivious to the game. I’m happy Andy Herren brilliantly and proudly embraces the rat floater role! I love Rachel Reilly but she really gave floaters a bad name. Floaters are people who just haven’t been given privilege and respect in the house yet because you are who you are. I love floaters; they tend to be the biggest surprises in the game.\nLike Godfrey Mangwiza. How has social media changed post Big Brother life? Used to be, after the reunion show, you’d never hear from these ‘freaks’ again! But now, in many ways, I think the real BB game begins after the show.\nYou’re 100 percent right. Former players can really mold themselves into the person they wished the show had portrayed them as -- or make it worse! Also, past players can commentate on new seasons, not just as a person but a character who played the game. My cast has never really had any social media fights; but many BB alums are still fighting on Twitter! For fans, they can still continue to be voyeurs and follow the lives of their favourites. Fans, players and the media troll from time to time, so it keeps the storylines moving -- even if the season is over. It’s hard to keep up with everyone from past seasons, but I try!\nWere you shocked at how beloved you were after re-entering real life?\nCompletely. Even my partner, Scott, says, “You didn’t really know? You really thought Canada voted you have-nots because they hated you?” And we really thought Canada hated us. You’re so isolated in the house that it gets to you. You’re out of touch with the audience.\nYour season was criticized for having too many twists. I actually don’t mind twists as long as they’re character-driven; or like BB UK where producers try to screw psychologically with the houseguests, just the way George Orwell did in 1984. Thoughts?\nEven before I was on the show and won, I always backed twists. Some fans want pure game play back, but I don’t necessarily think we would see Big Brother 2 again if we stripped it down because we’ve seen it. With no twists, you can size up who will win, and big alliances, like the Chop Shop, will power through the house until the end. Twists help stop that. I love character-driven twists, too. Like what Survivor does. I also like giving individuals new powers like the Double Veto Bruno didn’t use, which force players to make bigger moves. Anything to shake it up. I like the idea of messing with people’s relationships, too. More mind f--ks, please! I think we should do a pure game one season, so fans demanding an original Big Brother season can get it out their system; and the rest of us can say, “See that didn’t work.” People just want to see a Dr. Will Kirby win again but it’s never going to happen. We’re in a new era of the game and life.\nWhat I love about the show is that it proves that human nature and history is destined to repeat itself, but every once in a while, it surprises us.\nYou see power struggles, the dismissal and ostracizing of people, but when the underdog wins power and changes the course of the game, that’s the best feeling in the world. That’s why I love Survivor, BB, and George Orwell’s books.\nYou can’t be a true fan of BB without being a psychology nut.\nYes. Using real people in these social experiments is fascinating TV.\nWhat do you think of Les Moonves saying there were a handful of casting disappointments this season?\nIt was a great season, so I disagree. I think Robyn Kass did a great job. You just don’t know how a group will work together. I think players like Austin Matelson, in retrospect, will grow on us as time moves on.\nDo you wish Big Brother would cast more of a diverse society in the house? Your season, for example, was way too young.\nIncredibly young, yes. I agree. I’d like to see a season of older versus younger! Race versus race! Or even better yet, all bisexuals. Imagine those showmances! I want more social experimenting. Like 16 gay people and one straight person so we can see the reverse of what we see every season... and see if there’s a difference. Or all black people and one white person. Why not cast people with disabilities. Or unique abilities. Let’s show that there isn’t just one type of person who can win this game; and that people in the margins can accomplish great things. Having said that, having gone to these auditions calls, ninety percent of people coming out are ‘The Diaper Alliance’ Millennial types. It’s insane how young these applicants are. We need to reach out to a more diverse demographics to come out.\nI agree. But, at the same time, if Kass can recruit young players, she should be able to find dynamic new or older types, too.\nYes, I agree. As a super fan, I really love recruits. They're important in the game. The more recruits, the better, because you don’t get copycats and you get people who will create and develop their own unique character.\nSuperfans: let’s discuss. I didn’t really consider you one even though you are...\nWell, I thought I was too, until I went into the house and met Jordan [Parhar]! [Laughs]\nThe majority of superfan nerds lack social sophistication needed to play the game well.\nYou’re hitting the nail on the head. It’s a difference being a super fan inside and outside the house. How many people watch Big Brother in real life? Not a lot. That’s why you and I are the weirdos in our social groups. When we set down with our friends, all we do is talk about Big Brother, but we’re in a minority. Jordan was like, 'why doesn’t everyone want to talk about Big Brother?' in the house -- not realizing not everyone is obsessed with it like we are.\nSince you’re helping with Big Brother Canada 4 casting, are you scouting for diverse players?\nYes! I’m on the streets looking! My mind is really committed to more diversity. I’m suggesting a lot of different people I find on social media or on the street to try out.\nWhy is Big Brother so popular in Canada?\nWe’re social creatures. Probably because there are fewer people here and we like to see ourselves on screen. I also think Canadians are students of psychology and we kind of like being voyeurs.\nE-mail: nelson.branco@sunmedia.ca\n Twitter: @nelliebranco\nTop stories Popular Latest Videos Video of attempted kidnapping suspect released\n0\nTime for Blue Jays ace David Price to get it right\n0\nFamily has 'no forgiveness' for York cop killer\n0\nFear, chaos heard in Sammy Yatim shooting\n0\nHold cop who killed dog accountable: PETA\n0\nEmotional Adele drops comeback single 'Hello'\n0\n'The children look delicious.
