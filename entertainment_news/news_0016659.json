The high at Philly Airport reached 65 while our overnight low was just 54.\nNOAA Overnight will remain cool with lows ranging from the lower 30s north and west to the lower 40s in Center City; Saturday\nwill be in the lower 60s with sunshine giving way to increasing clouds in the afternoon as a cold front will swing through overnight into Sunday with some light showers. We'll clear out by Sunday morning while the afternoon will be cooler with highs remaining in the lower 60s with a westerly wind.\nMonday will be just around 60 with a northerly wind as cooler air settles in; we stay there on Tuesday, but with a more northeasterly wind as a weak short wave may provide some clouds in the afternoon. Wednesday is in the middle 60s with a more southerly wind as an area of low pressure pushes up from the south along with the remnants of Hurricane Patricia. We'll stay in the 60s overnight and into Thursday with the possibility of some moderate rain as we're still in a drought in northern areas of the region.\nFor now enjoy your weekend, but don't forget to follow updates on my Twitter account(@scott_derek) as well as check my 7-day forecast(& follow the animated radar) ANY TIME at www.scottderekwx.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:41:33.387+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
