It's also about marriage, fidelity and the price one has to pay to live the life one wants to. It's about the seduction of the new capitalist world we live. Having grown up in bustling metropolises all my life, the urban middle-class experience and its idiosyncrasies have always fascinated me. The film is a reflection of what I see around me, brought to life by an inspiring cast of actors I deeply admire\" \nThe movie has released on October 15 on the digital platform, Royal Stag Barrel Select Large Short Films, which celebrates young and aspiring directors who like to tell an original story in a short duration and pushes them to perfect it. \nCommenting on the release, Raja Banerji, Assistant Vice President, Marketing, Pernod Ricard India, said \"We are extremely thrilled to announce our next release, Nayantara's Necklace on the Royal Stag Barrel Select Large Short Films platform. This unique platform continues to receive an overwhelming response not just from Directors, but from viewers as well. Over 5 million viewers have watched and appreciated our previous releases.

We are glad to associate with Jaydeep Sarkar, who has created yet another enthralling narrative that is being released under this perfect platform.\" \nFull of suspense and surprises, the short film revolves around a necklace and showcases the empty spaces that exist behind the bustling lives of modern metropolises, which result in forming an accidental friendship between two completely opposite characters played by Konkona and Tilotama. \nBesides Sujoy Ghosh's 'Ahalya,' the Royal Stag Barrel Select Large Short Films' platform has also showcased shorts made by Anurag Kashyap and Sudhir Mishra in the past, which had actors, such as Radhika Apte and Chitrangadha Singh respectively.
