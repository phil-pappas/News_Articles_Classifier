COURTESY OF DIVINE WORD SEMINARY Related article » At the end of Cypress Street in the La Sierra area of Riverside is the Divine Word Seminary Residence and Retreat center. Its centerpiece is Riverside city landmark No. 44, known as the Hole Mansion.\nHole Mansion was built by Willits J. Hole, a wealthy land developer and speculator. In 1909 or 1910, he bought more than 20,000 acres in today’s La Sierra, Arlington and Norco areas after the land had gone into foreclosure. Though he soon sold off large parts of the property, including land that is now part of the city of Norco, Hole was still left with a sizable ranch of about 11,500 acres (18 square miles), which he began farming.\nHole was born in Indiana in 1858. As a young man, he became the owner of a chair factory, became a contractor and builder, studied architecture and began designing his own buildings. In 1893, he moved to California because of the health problems of his wife, Mary.\nAfter arriving, Hole bought 3,500 acres in the La Habra Valley. He later sold a part of the land that went on to become the city of La Habra. For that, he is known as the “father of La Habra.”\nIn 1912, the wealthy Hole family owned a palatial home in Los Angeles, a winter home in Palm Springs and a large yacht anchored in Wilmington. The family decided to build a large home on its La Sierra property as well.\nThe home was made with granite stone quarried from Hole’s La Sierra property. The new house sat at a higher elevation than most of the surrounding land, giving it a sweeping view of La Sierra Valley.\nThe home, designed by Arthur Benton, cost $15,000 to build. It was three stories, with a red tile roof. It featured a veranda across its entire front, which shaded the bottom two floors. The main floor featured a large drawing room, a dining room and a den. Each room had a granite fireplace.\nA separate wing had a music room with a custom-made organ with 1,000 stops. The second floor had four bedrooms, three sleeping porches and a nursery for the three children of the Hole’s only daughter, Agnes, and her husband, Samuel Rindge. The Rindge family moved into the home when it was completed in the summer of 1913.\nAlthough Hole did spend quite a bit of time at his home here, he had a passion for sailing and fishing on his private yacht. He took trips to South America and up the Amazon River and up to the waters off Northern California and Alaska. He even took former President Herbert Hoover on a fishing trip to Mexico, just the two of them and the 16-member crew.\nHole died in 1936 and was buried in Evergreen Cemetery. His wife, Mary, was laid to rest next to him two years later.\nIn 1956, the mansion and the last 60 acres of Hole’s original ranch were sold by heirs to the Divine Word Seminary.\nIf you have an idea for a future Back in the Day column about a local historic person, place or event, contact Steve Lech and Kim Jarrell Johnson at backinthedaype@gmail.com.", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvki62-b88528861z.120151001174446000g6ccb2sj.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvki62-b88528861z.120151001174446000g6ccb2sj.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T04:19:13.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
