In the new series, Tony Stark will leave behind Marvel's New York City to explore the world in hopes of finding out the identity of his biological parents after discovering he had been adopted.\n\"I think we all, no matter where we are in our lives, feel that the world has gotten much smaller,\" Bendis said to Entertainment Weekly about how the new global setting will affect Iron Man. \"We can all reach out to each other no matter where we are in the world. We feel each other's pains and victories. I think for Tony it's like that times 100. He's much more aware of the global situation and how a big fight with Galactus in New York would affect things in other parts of the world.\"\nThe writer also thinks Marvel's New York setting could use a break from the all the super-powered showdowns that place frequently within Marvel's pages.\n\"And yes, why do the villains always attack New York?,\" Bendis said. \"Why is New York the house of Legos that constantly needs to be rebuilt? If I was a villain, New York is the last place I'd attack, because you know, just by math, there are 700 superheroes in a 17-block radius. I'd go anywhere else. We'll be dealing with some of the criminals in the Marvel Universe who are smart enough to put that together in their head finally. Tony's gonna be racing to help people that don't necessarily always get the attention of the Marvel superheroes.\"\nMarvel released the cover for International Iron Man issue one on Instagram Friday featuring Maleev's signature art depicting Tony Stark as a James Bond -like figure.\nHitting shelves in 2016 - #IronMan goes global with @brianmbendis and #AlexMaleev! ðŸŒŽ\nA photo posted by Marvel Entertainment (@marvel) on Oct 23, 2015 at 7:32am PDT\nFor The Punisher , the comic giant is bringing together writer Becky Cloonan and artist Steve Dillion to deliver an action packed series that will push main character Frank Castle to his limits as he investigates a new drug that is creating unstable super soldiers.\n\"Things are going to start out in a familiar enough place, but soon The Punisher is going to find himself in an unfamiliar environment without a lot of the things he usually relies on,\" said Cloonan to comicbook.com . \"We are going to strip away some of his layers, and push him right to the limit. I want to see how far he'll go to accomplish his goals.\"\nBoth International Iron Man and The Punisher are se to be released in 2016.\nOn the television side, Marvel and Netflix also released on Friday the first full trailer for their upcoming series, Jessica Jones .\n Krysten Ritter stars in first full 'Jessica Jones' trailer Rosario Dawson will voice Batgirl in 'Lego Batman' 'Real' version of Thor's hammer can only be lifted by the 'worthy' Mark Ruffalo's Hulk to appear in upcoming 'Thor: Ragnarok'", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/p/9Lv4MFr3Ts/", "https://facebook.com/unitedpress", "http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/marvel-announces-new-punisher-series-international-iron-man-and-more", "https://www.facebook.com/UnitedPress", "http://www.ew.com/article/2015/10/22/marvel-international-iron-man-brian-michael-bendis", "http://comicbook.com/2015/10/23/exclusive-marvel-launches-the-punisher-with-becky-cloonan-and-st/"], "published": "2015-10-23T23:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:48:26.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
