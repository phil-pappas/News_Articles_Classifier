Hollywood glam and Bollywood color came together as Indian Americans and South Asians of all ages slowly filed into the theater. Bharat Patel, of Super-Dylan Entertainment LLC, the company responsible for putting together the concert, opened the evening in Los Angeles by welcoming the audience as the live orchestra set up on stage. \nShortly after, Singh, dressed casually in jeans and a blazer, humbly walked onto the stage and thanked everyone for coming to see him. \nThe Bollywood singer opened his first act with the quixotic “Muskurane Ki Wajah Tum Ho” and then continued through a romantic medley of songs like “Laal Ishq” from the film “Ram Leela.” He had everyone swaying through the end of the first act with hits like “Mast Magan,” “Suno Na Sangemarmar” and “Chahun Main Ya Naa,” one of his most famous songs from the film “Aashiqui 2.” \nWhile clenching his acoustic guitar, Singh then addressed the audience and said, “I’m going to sing my first song for you. It’s from the movie ‘Murder 2,’ and it holds a very special place in my heart. Here it goes… 'Dil sambhal ja zara, phir mohabbat karne chala hain tu.’” \nSingh’s passionate performance was taken to another level as he delved into his monsoon-inspired songs, “Mohabbat Barsa De Na Tu” and “Kabhi Jo Badal Barse.” The animated background singers, the live symphony orchestra and the heart-shaped raindrops on the screen behind Singh brought out the feeling of being on a Bollywood film set. All that was missing was a drenched heroine in a chiffon sari to run across stage. \nAfter a quick break, Singh resumed the second half like a rock-star as he belted out his own renditions of A.R. Rahman’s “Dil Se Re” and a slew of upbeat tracks like “Ilahi” and RDB’s “Aaja Mahi.” The crowd was on its feet, screaming, dancing and singing along, soaking in every minute of Singh’s energy and flawless voice. \nThe last act of the concert was an intimate acapella sit-down with Singh on the piano during which he said, “Now I’m going to sing some of my old favorites and songs I draw inspiration from. I don’t want to sing these by myself,” he added playfully. Singh sang classics like “Lag Ja Galle” and “Ek Pyar Ka Nagma Hain,” which delighted his fans. He then ended his concert in a perfect way with the transfixing song that made him a household name, “Tum Hi Ho.” \n“I loved every minute of it! You can literally sing along to each one of his songs,” said Nirali Shah of Glendale. “The live symphony orchestra definitely gave the concert an extra oomph,” she added. \n“He was great! His energy was contagious, and he sang with such ease. I was enjoying every minute of it,” Vivek Malkan from Ontario told India-West. \nSingh, only 28 years old, is a native of Bengal where he trained under Guru Rajendra Prasad Hazari. He put himself on the map when he first participated in the reality show, “Fame of Gurukul,” in 2005. He then became an assistant music programmer for renowned music directors like Pritam, Shankar-Eh san-Loy and Vishal-Shekhar. Shortly after, he sang his first playback song for the movie “Murder 2” in the year 2010. \nThe singer rose to prominence after his work for “Aashiqui 2” in 2013 for which he also won his first Filmfare Award and numerous other awards as well. He was most recently awarded with the Youth Icon – Music Award 2014 by the National Indian Students Union UK. \nSingh has just wrapped filming for his directorial debut in 2015 titled “Bhalobasar Rojnamcha,” a Bengali feature film compiled from seven short films. He also has a non-profit organization called \"Let There Be Light,\" which works for the betterment of his hometown Jiaganj Azimganj, West Bengal. \nThe Los Angeles concert was presented by Super Entertainment Inc. and Dylan Entertainment LLC in association with national promoter Roshni Productions, while the Oakland concert was presented by Jai Entertainment, AAPIO and AAA Entertainments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T16:45:34.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
