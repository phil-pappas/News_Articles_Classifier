In a battle round entirely devoid of gimmicks, \"The Voice\" ran away with this episode by letting the vocalists do all of the legwork.\nDuring an episode to remember, there were so many different musical genres on display, allowing the show to pinpoint its eclectic personality, which is often overshadowed by a heavy dosage of country music.\nBut on Monday night there was everything from Stevie Wonder to Regina Spektor, songs that riled up the audience to poignant numbers that featured touching narratives.\nThe coaches may have thrown around the word \"magical\" one too many times throughout the two hours, but there certainly was something brewing onstage tonight.\nTeam rosters are starting to be whittled down to the cream of the crop, and things are only going to get more interesting from here on out.\nBlind Joe vs. Blaine Mitchell — \"Old Time Rock and Roll\"\nThe first battle of the night was a sight to see, and Blind Joe was literally at the center of it.\nThough he remained in his seat strumming on a guitar throughout the performance, Joe proved his unique ability to interact with the crowd, imploring them to clap along and move with the beat.\nBlaine, who was overshadowed throughout the rehearsal process by Joe's larger personality and clever quips about his blindness, did not let that stop him from surprising the other coaches.\nWhile Joe worked to reach a higher register, ditching the raspy nature of his voice, Blaine remained steady, showing off his rocker persona.\nBlake went with Blind Joe, likely because he was afraid to give up a budding country star with an emotional story, but it was apparent that Adam had seen something in Blaine during the bout.\nThe former MLB hopeful was stolen by the Maroon 5 star, who will be able to hone a voice that hasn't yet reached its potential and, on Team Blake, was being mired by the country cluster.\nCassandra Robertson vs. Viktor Kiraly — \"Nobody Knows\"\nA 41-year-old mother of two pitted against the suave Hungarian star who turned four chairs. The two performers could not have been more dissimilar, and yet in the moment, looking into each other's eyes, they were perfectly aligned.\nCassandra had her work cut out for her against Viktor, whose effortless voice wooed all of the coaches in the blind auditions. But one of the oldest performers on the show rose to the occasion, countering every one of Viktor's notes with a run of her own.\nThe performance was best when the two voices were in harmony, when Viktor and Cassandra showed that they could connect with one another beyond just their vocals.\nAdam admitted that neither artist \"could have done better,\" but he went with Viktor in the end.\nIt seemed as though Adam had his mind made up before the battle even began, because based on their single performance, Cassandra shone brighter. Viktor, though, has more durability for the long run.\nChase Kerby vs. Korin Bukowski — \"Samson\"\nFaced with a song that suited Korin's voice, the young candy store worker was chasing rainbows from the start.\nGwen threw them a difficult narrative number that required an intense level of emotion and an extensive range of vocals. Chase found himself reaching for some of the heady notes, and that may have cost him.\nThe tenderness in Korin's voice made it seem simple for her, while Chase had to work much harder to match that.\nAfter getting all \"Mama Bear\" protective over her two performers and scaring Pharrell out of his chair, Gwen eventually picked Korin.\nIt was the right choice.\nEvan McKeel vs. Riley Biederer — \"Higher Ground\"\nRemember when Pharrell asked Evan to ad-lib some Stevie Wonder after his blind audition?\nWell the \"Happy\" singer had that in mind when he handed Evan and Riley the classic \"Higher Ground.\"\nEvan was clearly more prepared for the song choice — his uniquely high voice matched Wonder's signature vocals, and Adam expressed his envy that the 20-year-old could pull it off with such ease.\nBut when it came down to the actual battle, Riley went toe-to-toe with her partner. Bearing uncanny similarities to a young Kelly Clarkson, Riley was able to work the stage naturally and she hit some commanding notes.\nPharrell chose Evan because he was the safer pick, but Riley induced a steal from Gwen, who said she liked the 19-year-old's stage presence.\nThe \"No Doubt\" singer picked up a talented young vocalist here who was faced with an exceedingly tough matchup in Evan. Missy Elliott said it best in rehearsals: \"Riley is dope.\"\nBraiden Sunshine vs. Lindsey Elm — \"No One Else to Blame\"\nGwen took a risk after this battle, but it was one well worth the taking.\nTo see the stunned smile on Braiden's face when he was chosen was to see youth in its essence.\nLindsey probably put on the better performance overall, but there were two moments in Braiden's routine where he showed his true potential, and that spoke to Gwen.\nAlso playing in his favor was that he pointed out how he knew he had been sharp on a C during the duet. That kind of introspective technicality is something that can only mean Braiden has one of the highest ceilings on this show.\nIn the rehearsals young Sunshine said he felt he was being too quiet — onstage he was anything but.\nGwen has a lot of work ahead, but like Braiden said, \"that's the fun of it.\" It will be exciting to see where this young singer can go from here.\nAndi and Alex vs. Chance Pena — \"Wherever You Will Go\"\nChance is made for a teenage boy band by appearance, which is not to say there isn't a profound depth to his singing. His voice is gentle and soulful at the same time, and he had the extremely difficult task of competing with two voices.\nAndi and Alex were radiant on stage (Pharrell likened them to unicorns), and they were certainly the frontrunners coming in.\nWhile Chance was up for the task and his voice meshed really well with the blond-haired duo under the circumstances, Adam chose Andi and Alex because of their original sound.\nBut it wasn't the end of the road for the 15-year-old. Blake saw something in Chance (even though the kid wasn't wearing any socks, which defies everything country that Blake stands for), and the teenage heartthrob has another shot heading into the knockouts.\nRelated Stories 'The Voice' Top 12 Recap: Vocalists sing for America's votes 'The Voice' season 9, episode 2 puts Adam and Blake at odds ‘The Voice’ season 9, episode 3 recap: Love is in the air ‘The Voice’ Season 9, episode 4 recap", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:52:01.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
