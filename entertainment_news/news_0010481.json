Married for almost 40 years, with two grown children and four grandkids, they are both fit and active. While Alec is fully retired, Clara works two consecutive days at a hospital in the city, staying with family to minimize the commute. Living in a waterfront community, they enjoy the best of what retired life has to offer. But, like many couples their age, they’re dealing with the effects of menopause. While Alec supports Clara's decision to forego hormone replacement therapy and feels compassion for her suffering, he is frustrated that it has devastated their sex life. Little does he know where that frustration will lead him. After joining a bicycle club with Clara, Alec meets Paula, the beautiful woman who organizes the weekly bike rides. Alec is disappointed that the weekly rides always fall on one of the days that Clara is working, but decides to join in anyway. Before he fully understands what is happening, his life becomes an unpredictable journey of illicit sexual adventures - and not just with Paula. Although he is tormented by guilt, he finds it difficult to put an end to what amounts to every man's erotic fantasy.\nEach encounter brings new pleasures and discoveries but test Alec’s resolve to remain emotionally detached from these beautiful new women.. The wall he has built between the two facets of his life becomes increasingly obscure, and he knows that he can't keep the charade up forever. He had always been so protective of Clara's feelings. How could he go on without eventually hurting the woman he loves?\nThe age-old battle of Love vs. Lust is the core of this story, and Alec and his partners discover pleasures they never knew existed.
