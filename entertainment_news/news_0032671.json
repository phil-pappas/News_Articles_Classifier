These past few days have been no different.\" \nOdom is reportedly breathing on his own, but long-term brain damage from the incident is still a possiblity. \nThis video includes images from Getty Images.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T15:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:50:05.791+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
