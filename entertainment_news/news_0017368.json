No, not at the moment. Not at all.\" \nHe added: \"That's fine. I'm over it at the moment. We're done. All I want to do is move on.\" \nHowever, the handsome star, who became the highest-paid actor to play James Bond after he was handed a reported $10.7 million for 'Skyfall', has said he would consider signing up for the next movie \"for the money.\" \nMeanwhile, although Craig is adamant he's ready to quit the franchise after the upcoming movie, he recently claimed he'd signed a contract that may require him to make another. \nHe said: \"It's getting harder. But such is life. I'll keep going as long as I'm physically able. I'm contracted for one more - but I'm not going to make predictions.\" bang showbiz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:11:11.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
