Twilight Tenth Anniversary/Life and Death lands at No. 5. (The full list will publish on Thursday.)\nThe edition, with two jackets, includes the original mega-hit Twilight plus Life and Death , a new retelling in which she reverses the story: it’s now a human boy in love with a vampire girl. (Edward and Bella become Edythe and Beau.)\n“It's been oddly joyful for me to get to spend time with my old characters in a new form,” says Meyer, who shocked fans last week with news the book was on sale. “I had a fantastic time creating this version, and I hope the readers enjoy it just as much.”\nUSA TODAY\nMeyer calls latest effort 'not a real book'\nBut the best-selling author also admitted at New York Comic Con last week that the gender-swapping version “is not a real book, and I am totally aware of this.”\nNo matter. The anniversary edition sold 125,000 copies across all formats its first week, according to publisher Little, Brown.\nTwilight , New Moon, Eclipse and Breaking Dawn all hit No. 1 on USA TODAY’s list, and the series became a hugely successful movie franchise starring Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson. The Twilight Saga has sold 155 million copies worldwide.\n'Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard: The Sword of Summer' by Rick Riordan (Photo: Disney)\n'Magnus' opus: Rick Riordan’s rabid fan base is following him to the next mythological adventure.
