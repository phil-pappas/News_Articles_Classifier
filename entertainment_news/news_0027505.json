Through a free-of-charge future firmware update, a brand new DTS:X® decoder and DTS Neural:X upmixer will be added. In addition, the highly acclaimed Auro-3D sound processing engine can be added for an additional 3D sound solution (a fee is charged). The nine amplifier channels can be used to either experience one of the new 3D sound formats, or to bring the same or different audio signal to a second or third zone in the home.
