People have participated in community meetings like Monday's state required public hearings. DeKalb County School System DeKalb County Schools is setting out to become Georgia’s largest Charter School District. The two public hearings, held Monday at 1:30p.m. and again at 5:00 p.m., are part of the detailed process involved in the submission of DeKalb County School’s Charter District Application . Following Monday’s state required public hearings, the DeKalb County School Board will review the findings and vote to either submit the application or not. If approved by the local school board, the application goes to the State. The DeKalb School District begin this effort in May of 2014 and today, after much research and more than a dozen Community Engagement Sessions across the district, residents continue to show a lot of interest in the details of becoming a Charter School District.\nTrenton Arnold, Regional Superintendent, Region III is overseeing the Charter District Application process. He told Examiner.com he has been very impressed with the parents' and community members' involvement.\n“There has been a very knowledgeable community around this decision. They have taken ownership of it and come in with really great questions, great points and great ideas. They are not shooting from the hip coming up with something that would not work in a charter system or any system for that matter. They have well thought-out concerns and comments,” said Arnold.\nTrenton Arnold points out that while there are some people who are pro-charter and some who are against charters, all ideas together will help develop an application that will go before the DeKalb Board of Education for a vote.\n“Our Board of Education will have the ultimate authority to adopt a resolution in support of the application, they can direct the Superintendent to look at other options, or go back and get some more input or whatever the case may be,” said Arnold.\nEven if the DeKalb County School Board decides to approve the Charter District Application, the earliest the State Board of Education would make a decision would be April 2016. The detailed approval process involves evaluations, collaborations, questions, revisions, rewrites and steps of that nature.\nCharter schools are public schools that receive public funding. These Choice Schools cannot charge tuition and must maintain fair and open enrollment. They operate under the terms of a charter, or contract, with an authorizer, such as the state or local boards of education. Individual Charter Schools operate under the state, while Charter School Districts under a school board.\nCurrently the Fulton County Charter School District is the largest charter district in Georgia. Fulton gained its designation in July 2012 as today the entire district enrolls about 96,300 students. DeKalb County looks to become the largest Charter School District in the state by the fact that it currently enrolls 100 thousand students.\nSchool officials say gaining charter system status will allow, “The District and its individual schools the opportunity for innovation through flexibility and autonomy from state laws and Georgia Department of Education rules and regulations.”\nAccording to Quinn Hudson, APR, Director of Communications, “In exchange for waiving all state rules and regulations like classroom sizes, the number of days per year [for classes] and things like that, the District would not have to adhere to those. But in turn, the District would have to give more autonomy to local schools in the system.”\nHudson also says DeKalb’s Charter School Application will have no effect on existing charter schools, and will not keep existing traditional schools from becoming charter schools.\nReviewing the details of the online Cover Sheet for the application , the DeKalb County School District has identified a list of current challenges that they say can be address through charter system flexibility.\nAmong the listed challenges include: improving achievement among low income students, improving achievement among student with limited English proficiency, and increasing the high school graduation rate. The report states that by allowing local schools the opportunity to implement innovative practices specific to their populations, these and other challenges can be better addressed in ways that will improve student achievement.\nThere are currently 110 charter schools in Georgia, not including schools within charter systems.
