Joined in the promo video by one of the \"SNL\" cast members, Taran Killam , the singer/actress teases what she is going to wear during her hosting gig. The \"Wrecking Ball\" hitmaker first holds up two pieces of teeny-weeny gold fabric when asked about her outfit. Killam, however, outdoes her by going pant-less in another take. \"With or without clothes, we're not sure yet,\" Miley eventually says. \"We'll see.\" Miley Cyrus will kick off the \"SNL\" new season on October 3. She will pull a double duty as a host and musical guest. Amy Schumer will take over the NBC sketch show on October 10 and Tracy Morgan is tapped for the following week, October 17. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T17:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T21:25:35.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
