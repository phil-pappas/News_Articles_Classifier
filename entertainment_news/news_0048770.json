So long as the prisoners had a clean behavior record for the year, they could participate in the tryouts to make one of 100 possible spots.\nThose set to perform during the \"outlaw vs. outlaw\" tradition included Jo Ann Castle and Norma Zimmer, the \"Champagne lady,\" from the Lawrence Welk Show, Buck Owens and his Buckaroos, and Country Music Hall of Famer, Roy Acuff and his Smoky Mountain Boys.\nAnd, can you imagine the reactions of the inmates, when this veteran prisoner herself was called to the stage? Candy Barr, a former inmate from the Goree unit, turned exotic dancer, was probably the most anticipated opening day performer. After all, she was considered the \"first pornographic star.\" But, that wasn't her only head-turning asset.\nIn the early '60s, Candy had formed a relationship with Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby, who killed Oswald after he allegedly shot President Kennedy. Two months before the President's assassination, Ruby had come to visit Candy. Suspicions as to what Ruby may have told her had the FBI knocking on Candy's door twelve hours after Oswald had been killed.\nIf a movie was to be made about Candy Barr's colorful life, who do you think would be perfect for the role?
