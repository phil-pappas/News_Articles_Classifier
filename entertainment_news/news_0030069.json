Guggenheim Museum at Fifth Ave. and 88th St., the only major structure in the city designed by the late architect Frank Lloyd Wright was dedicated yesterday and opened to the public.\nThe controversial circular, six-story concrete housing for the Guggenheim collection of paintings and sculpture and its designer were highly praised by speakers at the dedication which was attended by some 300 persons.\nHailed by Lodge\nHenry Cabot Lodge U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, described the building as \"only possible in a free democracy.\"\nHarry F. Guggenheim, nephew of the museum founder and chairman of the museum board, said the building, which was described by critics as \"a corkscrew\" and \"a washing machine,\" was \"not only an evolution but a revolution and again demonstrates Mr. Wright's genius.\"\nNew York Daily News The New York Daily News published this article on Oct. 22, 1959. \"Youthful Spirit\"\nMayor Wagner called it a \"unique addition to our concrete skyline.\" Robert Moses said the design was \"evidence that Mr. Wright's youthful and creative spirit will always live.\"\nA letter from President Eisenhower, which did not refer to the design, said that \"this museum is a symbol of our free society.\"\nMore than 1,500 persons inspected the museum when the doors were opened at 2 P.M.
