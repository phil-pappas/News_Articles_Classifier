I'm here to say I'm on the side of the murdered.\" \nSo he's on the side of a lot of characters in his movies. \nTarantino's presence was noticed by police union officials. \nPatrick Lynch, who heads the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, on Sunday called Tarantino a \"purveyor of degeneracy\" and referred to his \"slanderous 'Cop Fiction.'\" \n\"It's no surprise that someone who makes a living glorifying crime and violence is a cop-hater, too,\" Lynch wrote, on the union's website. \"The police officers that Quentin Tarantino calls 'murderers' aren't living in one of his depraved big screen fantasies -- they're risking and sometimes sacrificing their lives to protect communities from real crime and mayhem. \n\"New Yorkers need to send a message to this purveyor of degeneracy that he has no business coming to our city to peddle his slanderous 'Cop Fiction.' It's time for a boycott of Quentin Tarantino's films.\" Advertisement \nOK -- I won't watch \"Grindhouse\" again. \nTarantino's next film, \"The Hateful Eight,\" hits theaters Dec. 25. \nTony Hicks writes celebrity commentary for the Bay Area News Group.
