More \nThe news comes a week after the former NBA player was hospitalized in Las Vegas after being found unconscious in a Nevada brothel. Kardashian rushed to his bedside and has been a constant presence ever since. \n\"This is a very delicate and difficult time for both Lamar and Khloe, and the most sensible thing to do at such a time is not make any big moves and put everything on hold. So that's what she is doing,\" the source told CNN. \nThe couple married in 2009, one month after meeting. Five days after they announced their engagement, they were wed in a ceremony that was filmed for an E! special. \nThe Kardashians seemed to quickly embrace Odom, who won two NBA championships as a forward for the Los Angeles Lakers. Family members were often photographed courtside at his games. The couple became the subjects of their own reality TV show, \"Khloe & Lamar,\" a window into what appeared to be a loving relationship. \nThe relationship began to unravel In 2013, when Odom was arrested on misdemeanor charges of DUI and refusing to take a chemical sobriety test. He checked into a rehab facility days later, and E! reported that he checked himself out within a day. \nAlmost a month later, Kardashian filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences, and their reality show was shelved. \nThe two signed divorce papers in 2015, but the divorce had not been finalized, a source told CNN. \nDespite the turmoil, Kardashian has said she still cares a great deal for her ex, and he continued to circulate in her orbit. \nA recent episode of \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" depicted Khloe disagreeing with sister Kim when she questioned Khloe's desire to check in with Odom to see how he was doing. \n\"Lamar and I loved each other deeply, and I don't believe in just acting like that relationship never existed,\" Kardashian said on the show. \"Things happened, but that doesn't just stop me from caring about him or loving him.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:38:00.630+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
