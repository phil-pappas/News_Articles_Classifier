It was not that I wanted a lightsaber and to be a Jedi; I wanted to know what made that robot look so real, how they make those spaceships look like they actually flew.”\nObsessed with space exploration from that moment on, he kept up with every space shuttle launch and visited Cape Canaveral with his parents.\nHe evolved from building model Vikings out of milk cartons to working in the world of real-life tech and robot construction. He’s given TEDx talks on building robots and spaceships, and the Nashville resident is currently in the midst of an estimated $500,000 project — a life-size reproduction of the film’s iconic Millennium Falcon ( fullscalefalcon.com ).\n“I am still a huge fan,” he said. “Even 38 years later, I can still sit down with Star Wars and be completely taken in. Whenever I watch that movie, I am 12 years old again.”\nThe intrigue of space is an integral part of American pop culture, from the first moon landing seen on black-and-white TV sets across the country to the nail-biting wait for Star Wars: The Force Awakens , the seventh installment of the nine-film series, opening Dec. 18.\nHere are more other-worldly obsessions:\n\"The Big Bang Theory\" on CBS gives voice to the self-professed geeks of the world. (Photo: Monty Brinton/CBS)\n‘The Big Bang Theory’\nLeonard (Johnny Galecki) and Sheldon (four-time Emmy winner Jim Parsons) are brilliant physicists who rock in the lab but nowhere else. Their beautiful, street-smart neighbor Penny (Kaley Cuoco) teaches them a thing or two about life; actress Mayim Bialik, who has an actual Ph.D. in neuroscience, rounds out the cast. The top-rated CBS sitcom, in its ninth season, gives voice to the role-playing, self-professed geeks of the world.\nFor \"Star Wars\" fans, Disney XD has \"Star Wars Rebels.\" (Photo: Disney XD)\n‘Star Wars,’ nothing but ‘Star Wars’\nWhile you wait for Star Wars: The Force Awakens , which harkens back to the style of the 1977 original, using real props and explosions to create its effects, there’s plenty of material available now. Disney XD’s Star Wars Rebels , a 3-D CGI animation set between the prequels and the original trilogy, begins its second season in October. And for those who want to know what happens between Return of the Jedi and the new film, author Chuck Wendig’s novel Star Wars: Aftermath offers clues as it follows pilot Wedge Antilles and former rebel fighter Norra Wexley.\n‘The Martian’\nThe perfectly cast Matt Damon stars in a Ridley Scott movie about an astronaut stranded on Mars. Based on a best-selling (and originally self-published) book by Andy Weir, the accessible story follows Damon’s character as he overcomes obstacle after obstacle, including learning how to grow food and survive for four years, while he awaits rescue. NASA experts lent a real-life hand to the movie’s makers. “These NASA guys are such film-philes,” Scott said. “They were all great enthusiasts of the book, so they were incredibly helpful.”\nWilliam Shatner.

(Photo: George Takei)\nBefore Star Wars , there was, of course, Star Trek , and nearly 50 years after its television premiere, the captain and navigator of the original USS Enterprise still command a place in science-fiction society. Both @williamshatner and @georgetakei — Captain Kirk and Lt. Sulu, respectively — are active on social media. The irascible Shatner promotes current sci-fi shows and interacts regularly with fans (and astronauts. Takei posts jokes, memes and his opinions on serious issues including gay marriage (Takei married his partner, Brad, in 2008).\nNeil deGrasse Tyson\nA Carl Sagan for the 21st century, astrophysicist Tyson follows his late predecessor’s lead in bringing space down to Earth without erasing its wonder. His longtime radio program StarTalk ( startalkradio.net ) evolved into a National Geographic Channel show, and his recent revival of Sagan’s television series Cosmos brought together celebrities, comedians and scientists to talk about space travel and aliens.\nAn alien invasion is the catalyst for \"Falling Skies.\" (Photo: Turner Entertainment Networks)\n‘Falling Skies’\nA Steven Spielberg offering, this TNT show begins six months after the world is invaded by aliens who neutralized the world’s power grid and technology, destroyed all major cities and took out most of the population. Those left behind banded together and fought back. The fifth season ended in August, but episodes are available for streaming at tntdrama.com as well as on Amazon.com and iTunes.\nHalle Berry stars as astronaut Molly Woods in \"Extant\" on CBS. (Photo: CBS)\n‘Extant’\nOscar winner Halle Berry stars in this thriller about astronaut Molly Woods, who after a year living alone in space returns to Earth — pregnant. She discovers that she has unwittingly put the human race on a path to destruction. The show, from executive producer Steven Spielberg, ended its second season in September, but you can still see it at cbs.com/all-access .\n\"Doctor Who\" is a perennial favorite on BBC. (Photo: Simon Ridgway/BBC Worldwide Limited)\n‘Doctor Who’\nPeter Capaldi’s second season as the planet-hopping Twelfth Doctor is underway on BBC America, and hello sweetie, there’s a surprise coming for fans of the timey-wimey, TARDIS-traveling, groundbreaking BBC classic in the Christmas episode: the return of the Doctor’s wife, River Song. Who is a difficult show to drop into — with more than 50 years of backstory and often-convoluted timelines, it’s not for a casual fan — but it’s inspired the imaginations of Whovians for decades.\nSyfy debuts \"Childhood's End,\" based on the iconic science-fiction novel of Earth's first encounter with aliens, on Dec. 15. (Photo: Syfy)\n‘Childhood’s End’\nIn 1953, Arthur C. Clarke wrote the iconic science-fiction novel of Earth’s first encounter with aliens, a work that has influenced every first-contact book since. At first, everything seems peaceful, but it becomes clear that the arrival of the mysterious “Overlords” came with a cost. SyFy begins the three-night, six-hour miniseries on Dec. 15 — the first-ever film adaptation of the book — starring Under the Dome’s Mike Vogel and Orange is the New Black’s Yael Stone.\nFind more great articles about NASA in USA TODAY's special publication, on newsstands now until Oct. 19.
