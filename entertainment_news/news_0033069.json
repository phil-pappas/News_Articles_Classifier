(Photo: Rachel Murray/Getty Images/Stringer) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nNBC - Get ready for at least 1.21 gigawatts of fun. \nIn \"Back to the Future Part II,\" Marty McFly and Doc Brown travel to the future ... all the way to Oct. 21, 2015. Well, we don't have flying cars yet, but that doesn't mean we can't have a good time by celebrating what has become known as Back to the Future Day. \n1. Watch the movies at home \nFor the month of October, Amazon Prime members will be able to stream all three \"Back to the Future\" movies for free. Movies are best watched with a fully hydrated pie from Pizza Hut, which, of course, appeared in the second movie as part of a product placement deal. \nFor those who want a higher resolution experience, Universal recently released a 30th anniversary Blu-ray set. \n2. Go to the theater \nThe movie is traveling back to the theater in many cities across the country. Sadly, it won't be playing in hologram form like \"Jaws 19.\" \n3. Play some video games \nIn October, \"Jetpack Joyride\" players are able able to play with a special \"Back to the Future\" theme for free. In November, it will cost $9.99, so get to it fast - unless you have some kind of time machine that lets you travel into the past. \n4. Ride a hoverboard \nOK, so the cool Hendo and Lexus hoverboards that went viral aren't available for purchase. But you can do some rad finger flips with this tiny replica ($29.99) that actually hovers (just barely!) in the air. \n5. Listen to the soundtrack \nWhat \"Back to the Future\" fan doesn't love composer Alan Silvestri's classic score? Now it's available in a $105 vinyl box set that includes music from all three movies and some pretty sweet album art. \n6. Drink a Pepsi Perfect \nThere is nothing like cracking open a Pepsi Perfect while confronting Griff Tannen at the Cafe 80's. On Wednesday, 6,500 lucky people will be able to order the limited-edition bottle on Pepsi's website. You can also buy one for more than $200 on eBay from somebody who received one at New York Comic Con. \n7. Take a look behind the scenes \nSuper fans can watch a documentary about the making of the films called \"Back in Time,\" featuring interviews with Michael J. Fox, Robert Zemeckis, Steven Spielberg and more. The movie will be released digitally on October 21. \n8. Watch the Cubs in the playoffs \nIn the \"Back to the Future Part II,\" the Chicago Cubs win the 2015 World Series. Back then, it seemed far-fetched. Now the team is facing off against the New York Mets in a series that will determine who goes on to compete for the whole enchilada. So far, the Cubs aren't faring well as the Mets have the series lead at 3-0. Wednesday's game does take place at Wrigley Field, so hopefully people will dress up in their Marty McFly outfits. \n9. Time travel \nThis can be accomplished by listening to \"Power of Love\" by Huey Lewis and the News over and over again until you become delirious and think you have actually traveled back to 1985. \n(Copyright Â© 2015 NBC Universal, All Rights Reserved) Read or Share this story: http://on9news.tv/1LL8y6A More Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T16:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:32:50.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
