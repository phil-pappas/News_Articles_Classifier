I don't think the youth of the country take up the wrong path after watching movies. No one turned Ram after watching 'Ramayan', and nobody turned Gandhi after watching 'Munnabhai M.B.B.S.'. So how come any one will turn into Charles after watching the film? The film is for entertainment...come and just get entertained.\"\nRandeep has worked hard for the film, and says Charles Sobhraj's character is one that he has known since he was much younger.\n\"We came to know about this man from the newspapers. When I was 10 or 12 years old, I heard about the name Sobhraj... since childhood, we knew this man is very glamorous. Amitabh Bachchan also benefited from him. The famous 'Don' movie dialogue \"11 mulko ki police mujhe dhoondh rahi hai...' was inspired from Charles Sobhraj's life,\" he added.\nCharles Sobhraj is currently in a jail in Nepal, having been convicted for his numerous brutal murders in the 1970s. He was even convicted and jailed in India from 1976 to 1997.\nHis story is being brought alive on the big screen by director Prawaal Raman. The film will release on October 30.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:45:54.272+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
