I’m going to do the best showstopper I can, but I don’t think I’m going to – I don’t think it’s going to be…” she said, choking up. \nHer facial expressions have been a highlight among Bake Off fans, even inspiring a tumblr called “The Many Faces of Nadiya Appreciation Blog”. Viewers have seen the 30-year-old switch between delight, despair, shock, terror and satisfaction. \nThe amateur was persuaded to apply by her husband and sister-in-law. “My family are constantly telling me that they are very proud of me, and that really helps me through,” she said. Promoted stories \n“My dad has loved the series and he goes up and down the street each Wednesday making sure everyone is going to watch it.” \nNadiya will be competing with Ian Cumming and Tamal Ray after the original 12 contestants were whittled down to a final three for Wednesday’s final episode. The Great British Bake Off’s Nadiya (Mark Bourdillon/Love Productions) \nFellow finalist Tamal, 28, revealed he was “nervous” before meeting the other contestants in case they were unfriendly. \n“I was a bit nervous about how all the bakers would get on before I started the show – but there has been a great feeling of community as we have so much in common,” he said. Tamal is a trainee anaesthetist (Mark Bourdillon/PA) \n“The whole thing was just amazing, and every week I would be stressed out from combining work with tinkering with recipes at home. But as soon as I got on the train to Bake Off, I would look forward to seeing the other bakers.” \nThe medic, who is a senior house officer in intensive care at Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester and is currently training to be an anaesthetist, said he’d been inundated with baking requests from co-workers. In case you were wondering what my flat looked like during bake off practice… #GBBO #nowheretoeatdinner pic.twitter.com/wkaKov8yHj \n— TAMAL RAY (@DrRayBakes) October 3, 2015 \n“All the team at the hospital have been very excited about the show and keep asking me to bring in bakes, but I have been full on with revision for exams since the show started,” he said. \n“I will now make amends and take in some bakes, as they have been asking for Black Forest Gateaux – I won’t be taking in any of the ornate showstoppers.” \nTamal was a big Bake Off fan before he applied. \n“I really wanted to give it a go primarily because I am just a big fan of the show – and when I walked into the tent for the first time it felt quite surreal,” he explained. \n“During the actual challenges you don’t get a moment to realise where you are.” The Great British Bake Off’s Tamal, with Sue Perkins (Love Productions) \nLooking back on his Bake Off experience, he recalled a “lovely moment” with presenters Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins, when the contestants were “sitting outside the tent in the sunshine with Mel and Sue making daisy chains”– adding: “It doesn’t really get better than that.” \nIan, 42, said he was “shocked” to be in the final – but called it “a fantastic personal achievement”, adding: “I never at any point considered myself as one of Britain’s best bakers. In the first episode I looked around at everyone else’s Black Forest Gateaux and felt out of my depth.” \nThe travel photographer said: “It’s a huge thrill to get to the final and it proves that life is never normal. I am really intrigued to see how it pans out. Bake Off contestant Ian (Love Productions/BBC) \n“This summer I have spent an amount of time on social media and buying Heat magazine – two things I didn’t think I would ever do in my life!” \nHe revealed he’d been known inside the Bake Off tent as Gadget Man – for having made props and tools including a camera tripod, cylinders to shape biscuit boxes and ice-cream, a bird-shaped pie mould, and a stand for his cream horns. \nIan’s Bake Off journey began last year, when his wife said she wanted to attend the tea party which takes place after the final. At the party, all the contestants from throughout the series return with their families to sample the finalists’ bakes. \n“My wife is basking in my reflected glory, and has been enjoying every minute of it,” he said.
