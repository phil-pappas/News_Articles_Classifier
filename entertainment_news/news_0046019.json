Instead it begins with the murder of 14-year-old Emmett Till, prompting Rosa Parks' refusal to move to the back of the bus less than 100 days later. \nIfa Bayeza's \"The Ballad of Emmett Till,\" now being staged by Renaissance Theaterworks under Marti Gobel's direction, shows us Till's grisly death and all the ways it signifies. \nBut most of its 105, intermission-free minutes joyously celebrate Till's life, presented in story theater fashion: Minimal props are moved by six black actors, five of whom play multiple characters. Gobel includes three live musicians, out of sight upstage; their bluesy accompaniment adds sass and grit. \nIn a breakthrough performance, Marques Causey embodies the ebullient Till. He's dressed to the nines and bent on making an impression. This Till is a born entertainer; as he enthusiastically tells us, he loves to do nothing more than joke and talk and tell tall tales. He's often very funny. \nBecause of a childhood illness, Till also stutters. Causey transforms this defect into an irrepressible asset. Struggles with some consonants evoke the bubbling, wide-eyed enthusiasm of one who can't ever talk enough because he loves what he calls the taste of life — rhyming and signifying and testifying. Dying simply isn't part of that equation. Not for him. \nExcept that it was, after a white woman convinced herself that a Till whistle — the way he'd reboot when his stuttering left him stuck — was a sexual proposition. \nThe ensemble gives us the rest of the story, which includes playing the whites who abducted, beat and then killed Till. Watching Causey crumple and cry is as painfully difficult as it should be. And I'll be living with James Carrington's murderous rendition of spasmodic, out-of-control hatred and rage for a long time. \nGobel captures the whites' accompanying shame and fear by turning actors upstage whenever they play white characters. \nAfter watching more than an hour of this cast's lovingly open embodiment of Till's extended black family — with particularly fine work from Allen D. Edge, playing black men old enough to know just how helpless they often are — some of them suddenly find themselves playing characters who literally can't face us or what they've done. \nBut Till's mother did, insisting on an open-casket funeral that confronted them and the world with what happened. An exceptional Ericka Wade delivers this profile in courage. \n\"Ballad\" occasionally sags and could definitely lose a few stanzas; it can also become pious agitprop when presenting Till as symbol or saint. He wasn't and doesn't need to be. As Gobel understands and Causey conveys, he was a fun-loving and sensitive kid, singing a snuffed-out song giving moving testament that black lives matter. IF YOU GO \n\"The Ballad of Emmett Till\" continues through Nov. 15 at the Broadway Studio Theatre, 158 N. Broadway.

It trails long, white tentacles of fabric that are tethered to the ground downstage by stuffed cotton bags. \nMost literally, this blood-spattered contraption calls to mind the cotton gin fan with which Till's murderers weighted his corpse when they tossed it into the Tallahatchie River. When Till is being beaten, it suggests the terrifying presence of a white-hooded Klansman. \nBut it also calls to mind various northern star quilting designs through which African-American slaves invoked the Underground Railroad. Or a compass, pointing due north. Or a gleaming star — call it Till's soul, if you'd like — emanating white beams of shining light as it rises into the sky, refusing to be bound just as Till's body refused to stay buried. \nRising from the Dead, Part I: Ericka Wade gets things under way by powerfully singing a ballad describing how Till's body rose; it did so on the third day after his abduction. Costume designer Leslie Vaglica underscores this parallel with Easter by dressing Causey in Easter colors: He sports a dashing, lavender-blue suit and white buck shoes (as well as a striped tie and Panama hat recalling some of our last pictures of Till). Bayeza's script also draws deliberate — too deliberate — parallels between Till's murder and Christ's crucifixion; Gobel dramatically underscores the connection at one point, in which Causey's slumping and dying Till is held up, on outstretched arms, by the men standing on either side of him. \nTragic Foreshadowing: Gobel rightly makes no effort to hide the fact that one of this set's few props — doing duty at various points as a table and a counter — is actually a coffin. Bayeza has written a lot of foreshadowing into \"Ballad\"; it can be all the more effective because Causey's Till is so blissfully unaware that things he says and does — including playing with his father's ring, giving his trademark whistle (recreated by Brian Bauman's harmonica), referring to a cotton gin, or chewing the bubblegum he loves and will be buying when he's accused of whistling at a white woman — will eventually mean so much more than he can possibly realize. \nWith the benefit of hindsight, everything in Till's life has become a symbol for us; we see and we wait for what we know will come. But Till doesn't see and wait; he waits and sees, filled with anticipation as he careens into a future that he's sure will open up rather than close down. Causey recovers and redeems that long-vanished past, making it the all-consuming present it once was for a teen still young and innocent enough to believe he could outrun history. \nRising from the Dead, Part II: One of the most dramatically effective and inspiring uses of the onstage coffin? As a prop box, into which this storytelling ensemble places and removes props and items of clothing. \nMy takeaway, from this ingenious move on Gobel's part: The story being told here may indeed begin with Till's death. But that story cannot be bound or shut away — not when storytellers like Gobel, her designers and these actors can create life from death, bringing alive the dead matter of the past and making it sing anew. I've read and seen a lot in my life about Emmett Till. But in bringing him alive here, Causey has made me feel as though I understand him as an actual person better than I ever have. That's how theater works. That's what good actors do. \nObliterating the \"N\" Word: One of Causey's most memorable moments comes as he relives the last night before Till is abducted. Moving toward tears and stuttering uncontrollably, Till asks his black friends why they casually use the notorious epithet that does so much to dehumanize them all. There's never a good answer to that one, and Till's companions don't have one. \nIn this scene, Carrington mouths that word while playing Till's teasing black relative. Moments later, Carrington repeatedly uses the same word in playing the most brutally sadistic of Till's white murderers. While Bayeza's assignment of multiple roles to actors doesn't always work — minor characters are often insufficiently distinct from one another, and some of them aren't really necessary to this play — Carrington's embodiment of this particular juxtaposition and his use of this particular word are hard to hear.
