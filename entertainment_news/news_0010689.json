She added: “Everything is cleaned with cotton wool buds, distilled water, small, delicate brushes and a low suction vacuum cleaner. A gardener tends to the huge foliage in the grounds of the historic building. \n“Specialist items and clockwork is carried out by a clock maker and conservation officer.” Putting Shugborough to Bed runs from 11am until 5pm on both days. Visitors can find out exactly what the team do during the winter cleaning and conservation programme and how the estate’s most treasured artefacts are checked over and cleaned before they are covered up and preserved for future generations to admire. \nTickets are £15 per adult on the day and £12.50 in advance.
