The multi-talented actress speaks exclusively to Bengaluru Chronicle about her upcoming release Priyanka directed by Dinesh Baboo and much more. “It feels great that I am getting good offers despite not doing films on a regular basis. My last film was Krazy Star and then I got busy with our debut home production. Dinesh Baboo approached me for Priyanka while we were busy with the shooting of Uppi 2. The story and script is promising, and inspired by a real life incident. I was interested in it as the character has great potential. In fact, Prakash Raj and Veena Sundar have equal scope, adding great value to the story. Unlike my previous releases, in Priyanka the character is the main focal point, and the script revolves around this — a character with several shades,” says Priyanka, who also admits that it is hectic to be an actor, wife of a director-cum-actor and producer, and most of all, a mother of two. “I am managing to the best of my abilities. Doing one or two films a year has helped me in planning many things to a large extent. Moreover, my two darlings — Aishwarya and Ayush, are grown up and spend time at school and are busy with other activities so I get some time off. With talented script writers and good scripts, I believe that taking up one or two projects a year and doing quality films is what works best. Kannada films are going through a good phase, as stories and honest film making are the mood of the hour. It is the same with Upendra Productions too — we are determined to promote new talent and good subjects,” she explains. Her children enjoy watching films and even accompany her to film shoots once in a while. “They do not like the shooting part as much, as it takes a long time, but they connect well when they watch films, particularly Aishwarya who is a little emotional,” says the mother of two. So does she exchange notes on the kind of films she takes up with her Real Star? Priyanka smiles, “It is quite common as an artiste and as a wife to talk about work with a husband — who is a director and an actor. I tell him (Upendra) about the scripts. But the ultimate decision remains with me. I never interfere in his selection and neither does he. We enjoy our differences like a typical husband and wife. We have typical boy and girl conversations too! If I want to watch drama, he prefers action. At the end of the day, I tend to give more importance to his selection of scripts,” she laughs. The actress is presently busy shooting for her next venture Mummy, which is a horror movie with a difference. While Priyanka reveals that she does not workout, she hopes to start. “I do not workout nor do I follow any strict diet. I love food and I need to eat for all the energy I need. I guess it’s the busy schedule and multi-tasking that has kept me in good shape. Apart from doing some routine exercises and yoga once a while, there is absolutely nothing else. My resolution for next year is to start a regular exercise regime, but I do not know if I will be able to do it,” she concludes.\n Sandalwood Priyanka Upendra Dinesh Baboo Also Read Sooraj Pancholi injures himself while shooting for 'Hero' Ranbir Kapoor and Ayan Mukerji's boys night out I should have been in 'Baahubali': Amitabh Bachchan Pictures from Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol's 'Dilwale' wrap party", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151014/entertainment-sandalwood/article/priyanka-mummy-returns", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/UPPI%202_%28108%29%5B1%5D.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/UPPI%202_%28108%29%5B1%5D.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-14T23:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:56:41.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
