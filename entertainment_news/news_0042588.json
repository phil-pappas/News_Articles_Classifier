In a country where people are obsessed with light skin tone, actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui says beauty is not about being fair.\n\nNawazuddin Siddiqui \nNawazuddin has aligned with the league of Bollywood beauties Kangana Ranaut, Anushka Sharma and Richa Chadha who have no interest in promoting fairness cream brands.\nWhen IANS asked the newly-appointed ambassador of The Mayur Suitings about endorsing a fairness product, Nawazuddin said: \"Fairness? No, no. No plans (of promoting fairness creams). You don't need a product to look beautiful. Some people have a measurement for beauty... that people with a particular complexion are beautiful.\"\n\"I believe that beauty is personal. It's not forced on anyone like if you are fair then only you are beautiful. This is a concept of the West that we have borrowed from them,\" added the 42-year-old.\nWhat about fashion?\n\"Fashion is something that you think looks good on you considering your body type and comfort. It is not what a particular group of people suggest,\" said Nawazuddin, who likes to dress up in casuals on most days and suit up for formal events.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:58:33.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
