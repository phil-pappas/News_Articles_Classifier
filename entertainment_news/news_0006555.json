And with political winds blowing against the ruling party, the election could create new power struggles just as the country grapples with more than 2 million refugees and tries to avoid being drawn into the chaos in neighboring Syria and Iraq.\nTurkey, which used to be held up as a rare example of stability and democracy in the Middle East, is now looking increasingly unstable, reports CBS News correspondent Holly Williams.\nPlay Video CBS This Morning Outrage against Turkish government as bomb attack death toll rises The death toll from Saturday’s twin bomb attacks in Turkey’s capital of Ankara reached 97, and the Turkish government says ISIS is the prime susp...\n\"We are now facing uncharted waters in terms of deadly violence in Turkey,\" wrote Omer Taspinar of the Brookings Institution in Today's Zaman, an opposition newspaper. \"We are also in uncharted waters in terms of political polarization in the country.\"\nTurkey has suffered a spiral of violence since July, when a similar suicide bombing killed 33 Turkish and Kurdish activists in a town near the Syrian border, ending a cease-fire. Kurdish rebels blamed Turkey's government, and hundreds have been killed since then in the renewed conflict with security forces.\nAs Kurdish politicians tried to lay flowers at the scene of the attack Sunday, there was a confrontation with police, who said investigators were still working at the site.\nThe attack in the heart of the capital - far from the conflicts bleeding over Turkey's southern borders - is rattling nerves around the nation and beyond.\nAmid the turmoil, the Turkish lira is losing value and interest rates are spiking, making it more difficult for Turkey to finance its looming short-term debt. Persistent instability also could harm tourism, an important source of revenue and foreign currency.\nThe Kurds are an ethnic group whose lands straddle Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey, where rebels fighting for autonomy in the mainly Kurdish southeast region since 1984 had been engaged in peace process with the Turkish government since 2012. Their influence has only grown since their kinsmen in Syria and Iraq have become important allies in the U.S.-led coalition's fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ISIS .)\nAnalysts say the bombings could only make the parliamentary election results less conclusive, meaning government stability will depend on the political parties' ability to form coalitions and cooperate - an elusive capacity as the country becomes more and more polarized.\nView Gallery\nFamily members and friends carry the coffin of Korkmaz Tedik, a victim of the October 10 bomb blasts, during a funeral ceremony in Ankara, October 11, 2015 Turkey.\nGokhan Tan/Getty Images \"The optimistic scenario is that a broad based government will emerge and that it will re-establish stability and revitalize the peace process with the Kurds,\" said Sinan Ulgen, who runs the Istanbul-based EDAM think tank.\n\"The other possibility is that the same picture will emerge, that a coalition won't be formed, leading Turkey into an even more tumultuous point,\" Ulgen said.\nFor more than a decade, Turkey has been led by a single party, which Erdogan founded and continues to run behind the scenes. Disregarding rules requiring him to be neutral, Erdogan campaigned for a supermajority for the ruling party, which would have allowed it to change the constitution and give his presidency more powers. That backfired and electoral gains in June by Turkey's pro-Kurdish party left the ruling party without even a parliamentary majority.\nErdogan's opponents now accuse him and his interim government of rallying nationalist votes by fomenting violence between the Kurdish rebels and security forces; Erdogan denies this, saying government forces are responding to increased attacks.\nGovernment opponents, including a pro-Kurdish party whose members were at the rally, have held the government and Erdogan responsible for the bombings, which killed at least 97 people and wounded hundreds at a rally Saturday in Ankara.\nThe accusations range from failing to take adequate measures to protect the rally, to turning a blind eye on ISIS for too long and even the possibility of having some hand in the attack. Hundreds marched in the capital Monday, chanting \"the killer state will be held to account!\"\nPrime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu rejected the accusations as \"dangerous\" and \"dastardly.\"\nHe also denied that the bombings were a response to Turkey's growing involvement in the war in Syria, or that the government is dragging the country into the Middle Eastern quagmire.\n\"These attacks won't turn Turkey into a Syria,\" Davutoglu said.\nNo group has claimed responsibility for Saturday's bombings, but Davutoglu said investigators are close to identifying one of the two men who blew themselves up. He said ISIS is the \"No. 1 priority\" of the investigation , but did not rule out the possibility that the Kurdistan Workers' Party may have been behind the attack.", "external_links": ["http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/10/12/401f2750-0fe6-4bbb-924d-d5433ac2402f/thumbnail/220x140/b32ca99cb472ef3669f120e77d508c87/ctmturkey1012455451640x360.jpg", "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/10/12/2dfe8799-b02f-4acd-8c7d-a4f943ee81e9/thumbnail/620x350/d8538af6706890c60af42b4556842c45/gettyimages-492240688cr.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-13T01:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:09:06.289+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
