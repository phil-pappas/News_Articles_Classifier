The government never commented on it.\nRaul Castro and President Barack Obama surprised the world last Dec. 17 by announcing the two former Cold War foes would end decades of confrontation and seek to restore diplomatic ties.\nIn conjunction with detente, Cuba released 53 prisoners who Washington had considered political, but Maldonado was detained eight days after the historic announcement.\nThe dissident Cuban Commission of Human Rights and National Reconciliation estimates there are about 60 political prisoners in Cuba, including some two dozen held for peaceful acts of political protest.\n\"Now I am going to try to recover my energy and be with my daughter,\" Maldonado told Reuters by telephone upon his release. \"I want to travel to the United States in the future and thank all the people who supported the cause to have me freed.\"\nAmnesty International welcomed Maldonado's release but said he never should have been jailed in the first place.\n\"Peacefully expressing an opinion is not a crime,\" Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International, said in a statement.\n(Reporting by Nelson Acosta; Editing by Daniel Trotta , Chris Reese , G Crosse and Leslie Adler)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T05:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:51:51.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
