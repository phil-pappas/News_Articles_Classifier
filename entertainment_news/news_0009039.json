The Cornell University football legend and World War I hero injured his lungs in a Navy ship explosion, developed tuberculosis, and died in 1924 at age 30 in Tucson, Arizona where he had moved for the dry climate.\nBut when seven members of Barrett's family who have made a 3,000-mile cross-country pilgrimage from California - including his lone surviving 95-year-old daughter Eleanor - gather at Schoellkopf Field in Ithaca on Saturday to watch the Cornell-Harvard game, Charley's presence will be very much felt.\nThe handsome young man dressed in woolen shirt, baggy pants and clutching a football in those black and white photographs will have jumped off the pages of their family scrapbooks. A beloved two-time All-American in the era of triple-threat quarterbacks, Charley Barrett will be running, passing and kicking again on the field he christened when Schoellkopf Field opened in 1915.\nSaturday's game also marks the 100th anniversary of Cornell's first victory ever over Harvard, a 10-0 clash in Cambridge, Massachusetts in which Barrett scored the only touchdown to end Harvard's 33-game unbeaten streak. Coach Al Sharpe's \"Big Red Machine'' would finish the year 9-0 and take the 1915 national championship, the first of five won by Cornell.\nIn 1958, Barrett was inducted into the National Football Foundation's college football hall of fame. Barrett's late wife, Edna, and daughter Eleanor (Paul), who was just 3 when her dad died, attended that event on campus. But this weekend's trip, years in the thinking stage, will carry added meaning for Eleanor.\nAnne Gordon and Tom Paul at the plaque dedicated to family's grandfather, Cornell legend Charley Barrett at Schoellkopf Hall on Friday.

(Photo: Cornell)\n\"It's quite an experience that I've been looking forward to,'' she said while in route from Nashville, where the family had flown to visit other family members and rent a van for the drive to New York. \"I've been to Cornell two or three times, but of course, this trip is just for our own family, so it's special.''\nIt's more proof that the best team a person can be on is family.\nFour of Barrett's seven grandchildren are on the trip. Jim, Tom and Varina \"Vee'' Paul, each in their 60s and 70s, and Steve Gordon, have only known Grandpa Charley through old photographs, newspaper clippings, letters he wrote to his wife while in the hospital, and military papers. And of course the stories handed down through generations.\n\"He's always been part of our lives because of his great success with the Cornell team, and we feel like we know him and we're very proud,'' Vee (Paul) Proietti said. \"It's always been fascinating to all of us and over the years we've met a lot of the Barrett relatives in Pennsylvania. Even when you didn't know the man, there is a great sense of pride, and every time you Google his name more stuff comes up. All of us grand-kids have had an interest because it's also a tragic story. After 1917, the rest of his life was spent just trying to get over the injuries he suffered on his Navy ship.''\nCharley Barrett was born in Bellevue, Pennsylvania, grew up in Cleveland, and enrolled at Cornell in 1913. After leading the football team to an 8-2 record in 1914, the stage was set.\nHistorians note that 1915, in addition to numerals being put on uniforms for the first time, was also the year college football gained national appeal when teams from east of the Mississippi began playing teams from the Far West.\nBefore unbeaten Cornell headed off to face Harvard, \"Captain Barrett,'' according to The New York Times , told a crowd of 2,500 well-wishers at the train station, \"I promise the team will do its very best, and we hope to bring that football here to add to our trophies at Schoellkopf Hall.''\nHe made good on the promise.\n\"Harvard was naturally looking further ahead to the Princeton and Yale games, and made the error of holding the Cornell Eleven too cheaply,'' reported The Times .\nCornell capped its unbeaten season by beating Penn 24-9. The Big Red trailed 9-0 before Barrett scored all of his team's points on three touchdown runs, a drop-kicked field goal and three extra points.\nCharley Barrett \"is one of the best all-around athletes who has ever played for the red and white,'' said The New London Day of Connecticut.\nBarrett, struggling in his mechanical engineering studies, left school in 1916 and enlisted in the U.S. Navy, where he rose to the rank of lieutenant junior grade. He was injured in an explosion aboard the cruiser USS Brooklyn in Yokohama Harbor, Japan, and never fully recovered.\nA year after his death, his Cornell teammates, friends and the 1915 Penn team erected a bronze tablet just inside the entrance to Schoellkopf Hall that generations of Big Red athletes have walked past, which reads in part \"as a tribute to his splendid loyalty and leadership and as homage to a most worthy gridiron adversary, we respectfully dedicate this tablet to Cornell University.''\nBarrett's family plans to tour campus and, of course, see Charley's plaque.\n\"I think with this trip, for us it was now or never,'' Vee Proietti said. \"My mom is 95 and very spry and very sharp. But at 95, you either do this kind of thing or you don't and say you wish you did. That it's the Harvard game, it's just wonderful to be taking her to that.''\nAh yes, the game. These California folks are USC Trojans fans by geography but Cornell fans by blood.\n\"Steve and Tom are huge college football fans so it's fitting that they came from someone who was a star quarterback,'' said in-law Matt Proietti, Vee's husband who works for the Air Force in public affairs and has done much of the research into the family's famous patriarch.\nThe 1915 Cornell Eleven went 9-0, won the national title, and was led by triple-threat back Charley Barrett.

(Photo: PROVIDED)\n\"Everyone is proud of him,'' Proietti said. \"We have a lot information and with the Internet just getting bigger and bigger, it's like more stuff keeps getting put out there. It was an interesting time that he played.''\nEleanor Barrett recalled that the hall of fame event in 1958 was attended by teammates of her father's, some 43 years after they had played together, and the plaque on campus is something that Vee Proietti said \"speaks volumes for what they thought of him.''\nJust as it speaks volumes that Charley Barrett's family would make a 3,000-mile pilgrimage to see the place he played football 100 years ago. Yes, there's no team like family.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/50117b4bfe181f32492ec4d414638d7c08e560e6/r=500x400/local/-/media/2015/10/09/Rochester/Rochester/635800054909671385-FullSizeRender.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/732d1fbd83b4e09ed0c58dec648833bd5730e56d/c=4-0-444-331&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/09/Rochester/Rochester/635800052447507602-1915cornell.png", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9e555867d491c895d3e79be2c51befc87c053d19/r=500x369/local/-/media/2015/10/09/Rochester/Rochester/635800052447507602-1915cornell.png", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f115dcfc5b9682e6d34b4682883975eaab2240bc/c=30-0-1502-1107&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/09/Rochester/Rochester/635800053984117452-CornellFootballTeam1915.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d7a7cddce920975cd86c50a744dd3637155aa10a/c=14-0-142-170&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/10/09/Rochester/Rochester/635800068685963694-1405698696-0039-1.png", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/17f96d78ba8eb66e76caaa7413ccb18a74299160/c=0-154-2152-1772&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/09/Rochester/Rochester/635800054909671385-FullSizeRender.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8f2d4ceca58a6a0c73acc03cf81ff9b74a2332db/c=4-0-3260-2448&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/09/Rochester/Rochester/635800070486995239-IMG-8372.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/09/Rochester/Rochester/635800053984117452-CornellFootballTeam1915.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/09/Rochester/Rochester/635800070486995239-IMG-8372.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/09/Rochester/Rochester/635800054909671385-FullSizeRender.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/24866a7081e6ea1a4484bae21b0c65ca8cb0e92c/r=166x400/local/-/media/2015/10/09/Rochester/Rochester/635800068685963694-1405698696-0039-1.png", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/09/Rochester/Rochester/635800052447507602-1915cornell.png", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a996f8ae139ed10ceed9e0bd171d097f142536a2/r=500x361/local/-/media/2015/10/09/Rochester/Rochester/635800053984117452-CornellFootballTeam1915.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3d5569507733ca056af5edaf0a2a8036c559fb13/r=500x375/local/-/media/2015/10/09/Rochester/Rochester/635800070486995239-IMG-8372.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/09/Rochester/Rochester/635800068685963694-1405698696-0039-1.png"], "published": "2015-10-10T02:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:03:17.147+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
