They craft two-inch thick playbooks that can read like the tax code, hoping that all their formations and personnel groupings will give them the edge on game day. Sometimes, common sense needs to come to the forefront, and that's what Bills coach Rex Ryan is employing in his handling of Buffalo's mega-talented defensive line. He has great players up front, and he's playing them as much as he can. Pretty simple.\nThrough three games, defensive ends Mario Williams and Jerry Hughes have played around 90 percent of the defensive snaps, a huge difference over 2014 when they hovered just above 70 percent with Jim Schwartz serving as Doug Marrone's defensive coordinator.\n\"It’s hard to take out two Pro Bowl players,\" Ryan said, forgetting that while Hughes has played to a Pro Bowl level the last two seasons, he has never actually been selected for the game. \"We’re playing a great deal of snaps, but these guys are in great shape, they’re in great condition. Will we rotate guys in? Yeah, we will. But you’re obviously taking out a great player if you take out one of those two guys. So shoot, I like to see those guys out there. I feel better when those guys are on the field.\"\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nBills enjoying early success in red zone\nLast year under Schwartz in his 4-3 scheme, Mario Williams led all the defensive linemen by playing 72.5 percent of the snaps, followed by Hughes (71 percent), Kyle Williams (66) and Marcell Dareus (62).\n“If I'm more tired, you gotta do what you gotta do. Hey, I like to be on the field, I got no problem with that.”\nMarcell Dareus To date in 2015, Mario Williams has played 93.7 percent of the snaps, Hughes 89.5, and Kyle Williams 76.2. Dareus' 48 percent figure reflects that he missed the first game due to a suspension, but in the two games he has played, he was on the field for 79 and 63 percent of the snaps.\n\"Of course I've noticed it, I feel it,\" said Dareus. \"Rex has a plan and he sees what the potential of our team can be. If I'm more tired, you gotta do what you gotta do. Hey, I like to be on the field, I got no problem with that.\"\nSchwartz wasn't an outlier on this issue. Many coaches believe that you need to rotate defensive linemen in order to keep them fresh throughout the game, provided you have capable players.\n\"It has a lot to do with personnel,\" said Giants coach Tom Coughlin. \"We’ve tried to implement that as best we can here, but in order to do that, you need reasonable depth, and those are the guys who can go in the game and be as productive as you can.\"\nLast year the Bills had eight defensive linemen on the roster as ends Jarius Wynn and Manny Lawson joined tackles Corbin Bryant and Stefan Charles in backup roles. This year, Wynn is out with a knee injury, Lawson is now a linebacker, and there's only newcomer Alex Carrington with Bryant and Charles on the second unit.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nMaiorana: Karlos Williams, Jerry Hughes came up big in Miami\n\"It's definitely a change because we have a different defense,\" said Bryant, who started in place of Dareus against the Colts. \"We only have a certain number of guys up. Last week we only had Mario and Jerry (at end) because Alex was inactive, so when you look at it like that, they're going to get the majority of the snaps. We rotated in Manny and Randell (Johnson) to spell them.\"\nThe Bills may get some help next week when end IK Enemkpali's four-game suspension is over, assuming Ryan activates him on game day when he returns. That, however, depends on the numbers needed at other positions. Suffice it to say, things will probably change week to week, but Ryan won't stop playing his best players for as long as he can ride them.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nBills defensive dominance put the heat on the Dolphins\nPatriots tight end Rob Gronkowski sets up to block Bills defensive end Mario Williams.

He doesn't really pay attention to how many snaps he or anyone else is playing, so long as the Bills have more points on the scoreboard at the end of the day.\n\"You want to go out there and help your team win and be out there and compete,\" said Hughes, who has been the Bills best linemen in the first three games. \"I don't think anybody is counting plays. If we're tired, we'll rotate because we know the guys behind us can play ball. It's all about chasing the 'W.'\"\nMAIORANA@Gannett.com\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nBills' Darby named NFL defensive rookie of month", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7ada544ca84017f48045b04d7eb00c665df21e03/c=277-0-4618-3264&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/01/Rochester/Rochester/635793070169543159-mario.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1d90a3725231efbc181204867922013b7b03c0e4/c=0-0-3188-1801&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/09/27/Rochester/Rochester/635789801040715652-Bills-Dolphins-Footba-Norr-1-.jpg", "https://infogr.am/bills_d_line-6877", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/01/Rochester/Rochester/635793070169543159-mario.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0d6bac79c835ace7c5e9259253c7b6925937342f/c=0-39-1441-853&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/09/27/Rochester/Rochester/635789801056627754-USATSI-8829622.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/028adbed88c4848644a0113d04c8733a28e0e304/c=228-0-1640-1412/local/-/media/2015/09/27/Rochester/Rochester/635789801047579696-USATSI-8829178.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/01/Rochester/Rochester/635793070169543159-mario.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a2fdf00b4eacd4aa7355e5126df04f60d229b917/c=0-350-1900-2250/local/-/media/2015/10/01/Rochester/Rochester/635792977843570553-darby.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T00:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:06:04.731+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
