Jolie and husband Brad Pitt are parents to six children, including Maddox, Zahara, and Pax, who hail from Cambodia, Ethiopia and Vietnam, respectively.\n\"We travel often to Asia, Africa, Europe, where they were born,\" the star shared. \"They boys know they're from Southeast Asia, and they have their food and their music and their friends, and they have a pride particular to them.\"\n\"But I want them to be just as interested in the history of their sisters' countries and Mommy's country so we don't start dividing,\" she said of keeping her family close. \"Instead of taking Z on a special trip, we all go to Africa and we have a great time.\"\nJolie and Pitt are also parents to Shiloh and twins Knox and Vivienne, whom the actress gave birth to in Namibia and France, respectively. All six children are homeschooled by teachers of different backgrounds, though Jolie intends to stop acting in the future.\n\"Maybe in the next few years I'll finish being in front of the camera,\" she revealed. \"I'm happy to be home. I want to really focus on my children, doing the best I can to guide and protect them before they are out of the house. These are their most important years.\"\nAngelina Jolie on the November cover of Vogue magazine.
