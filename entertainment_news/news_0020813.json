The US-led coalition has pretended to bomb Daesh (another name for Islamic State) for a year, without results. \n“If you do it in a more efficient way, I think you’ll see results,” he said. Pushkov refuted suggestions from Western nations that Russian planes were mainly bombing not IS jihadists, but rebel groups opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. ”The main target are the Daesh groups situated closest to Damascus,” Pushkov said. \n“We need to eliminate this group or at least neutralise it and afterwards we’ll see what Syria’s future is,” he said. Putin is due to hold talks with President Francois Hollande in the French capital on Syria before attending a summit also involving the leaders of Ukraine and Germany aimed at consolidating the fragile peace in Ukraine. \n 16 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T13:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:34:45.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
