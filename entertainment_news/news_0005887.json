Barker was conscious and alert.\nFortunately, two Los Angeles police officers happened to pass by at the exact time, said Henri Bollinger, Barker's publicist.\nThe officers who witnessed the fall helped Barker and called for an ambulance, according to police.\nAt the hospital, Barker received stitches for an injured forehead, Bollinger said. Barker also hurt his left knee.\nBarker was doing well in his home Wednesday morning, the publicist said.\nBarker, 91, was a staple on network television for decades -- hosting everything from game shows to parades to beauty pageants -- and he presided over \"The Price Is Right\" on CBS for 35 years. He won 19 Daytime Emmy Awards and retired in 2007.\nHe returned to the show in April in a special April Fools' Day appearance with current host Drew Carey.\nBarker deftly handled the first price-guessing game of the show, the classic \"Lucky Seven,\" before turning hosting duties over to Carey, who finished up.\nBarker is a longtime animal rights activist, and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals named its Los Angeles office for him in 2010. He always ended episodes of \"The Price Is Right\" with this line: \"Help control the pet population. Have your pets spayed or neutered.\"\nTaylor and topless meet at... Khloe Kardashian, Lamar...
