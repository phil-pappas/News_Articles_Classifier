After wrapping up a schedule of “Baar Baar Dekho” in Glasgow, the Bollywood actor on Saturday left Mumbai for an eight-day trip to New Zealand. The “Student Of The Year” actor is visiting Kiwi land as the first Indian ambassador for Tourism New Zealand, which markets New Zealand as a visitor destination. “Back at the airport now. Enjoy being a travel junkie, but don’t know which time zone to follow… “Excited to visit this beautiful country New Zealand as their tourism ambassador,” Sidharth posted on his Twitter page before taking off. He was in Glasgow to wrap up a schedule of “Baar Baar Dekho” with Katrina Kaif. During his trip to New Zealand, he is looking forward to experiencing the diverse landscapes, culture and adventure activities of the picturesque land. A lover of nature, great outdoors and extreme sports, Sidharth will also soak in the beauty of both the North and South Islands, while getting a chance to experience an array of activities. He will even learn about the country’s local Maori culture. The 30-year-old is especially “gearing up for some hardcore adventure such as skydive, SkyWalk and diving”. The actor has amassed a fan following, which extends to a faraway land like New Zealand, with roles in entertainers like “Student of the Year”, “Hasee Toh Phasee”, “Ek Villain” and “Brothers”.
