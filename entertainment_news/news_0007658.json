Each boy has to have something special you want to watch.” \nIn 2006, Liam Mower, James Lomas and George Maguire, the first three boys to play the title role, became the youngest performers ever to have won the Olivier Award for Best Actor with the show also picking up the Best Musical prize. \n“What’s wonderful is the first three boys in the West End have gone on to have great careers,” she said. \nShe said that casting budding Billy’s is easier than trying to find young actors to play the part of Michael, Billy’s gay friend. \n“He’s a really delicate part and you have to cast it right,” said Jessica, who also casts for the likes of Matlida and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. \n“Michael has to have good humour and have a vulnerable side, yet be totally charming.! \nThe tour, which plays the Theatre Royal Plymouth, from February 24- April 2 tugs at the heartstrings. \nSet in a northern mining town, against the background of the 1984/’85 miners’ strike, Billy’s journey takes him out of the boxing ring and into a ballet class where he discovers a passion for dance that inspires his family and whole community and changes his life forever. \nAcclaimed by audiences and critics alike, Billy Elliot the Musical has now been seen by more than ten million people across five continents and is the recipient of more than 80 awards internationally, including ten Tony Awards and five Olivier Awards. \n“You are supportive of the kid right from the beginning,” said Jessica. \n“He has to overcome so much to pursue his love of dance. You’d have to be made of cold stuff not to be moved. \n“It’s a political story, a story of family and foremost it’s a story about a boy.” \nTickets can be booked online at www.theatreroyal.com or by calling the Theatre Royal Plymouth Box Office on 01752 267222.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T13:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:42:20.411+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
