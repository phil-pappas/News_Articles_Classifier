October 9, 2015 Yahoo news Entertainment No comments Janet Jackson accepts the Ultimate Icon Award during the 2015 BET Awards in Los Angeles, California, June 28, 2015. REUTERS/KEVORK DJANSEZIAN This week Janet Jackson returns after a seven-year absence. “Unbreakable” is Janet Jackson’s first album since 2008’s “Discipline.” It also finds her re-teaming with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, Jam and Lewis brought her to mega-pop-star status in the 80s with classic albums like “Control” and “Rhythm Nation 1814.” The two continued to work with her through 2001’s “All For You,” then handling a couple tracks on “Damita Jo” and “20 Y.O.” The fact that “Unbreakable,” then is Janet’s most consistent and enjoyable release since “All For You” shouldn’t be a surprise. The lesson here is that, after working with each other for nearly thirty years, Jackson, Jam and Lewis know exactly how to work well together. She has consistently made her best records with them by her side. What’s striking about “Unbreakable” is its sheer subtlety. Sure, there are a couple in-your-face jams like the shiny electro funk of “Damn Baby” or the Missy Elliott-assisted “BURNITUP!” but for the most part this is a collection of low-key R&B, either in the “smooth-lovin’” vein of the hit “No Sleep” (featuring J. Cole) or showing a quieter, more melancholy side like on “After You Fall.” “Black Eagle” even has a meditative, gospel-like prayer energy. The fact that this is Jackson’s first album since her brother Michael’s untimely 2009 death may also be a reason for this album’s downbeat energy. Her uncanny vocal similarity to her brother on “The Great Forever” is enough to stop you momentarily in your tracks, even if it can be chalked up simply to genes. That resemblance has always existed. Now without Michael it is both comforting and a little haunting, particularly when you consider the two share a distinct knack for vocal phrasing. This album is not immediate. If you are looking for something as iconic as her work on “Control,” “Rhythm Nation” or “Janet.,” this record may seem a little subdued in comparison. (It takes a few listens to make its impression.) Really this album carries the latter-day charm of “The Velvet Rope” and “All For You.” After the somewhat unimpressive results of her last three records, this is the sound of Janet getting back on track. She’s as smooth as ever with an occasional electro shine. At its core, “Unbreakable” finds Janet quietly regrouping and going back to her essence. If loved her previous work, there is plenty to enjoy here. True to its title, this album shows Janet Jackson’s resilience.
