Using a large format view camera, and working extensively with natural light, he has photographed dozens of award-winning projects nationwide; and occasionally lectures and holds workshops on architectural photography. His recent books are “Iconic, Perspectives on the Man Made World” and “Ruin,” a photographic study of abandoned architecture throughout the United States. \nThe exhibit also features the work of photographers Sabastio Salgado, Rachel Perry Welty, Andrew Moore, Richard Misrach, Time feresten, Harriet Diamond and Rebecca Muller and others. The images explore the impact humans have had on the environment and helps stimulate thought about what happens to the things we build, what is our relationship to nature, what are the consequences of a consumer culture and how could we live differently. \n“Human Impact” is on view in the von Auersperg Gallery in the Hess Center for the Arts at Deerfield Academy, 1 Albany Road. Gallery hours are weekdays from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. and weekends by appointment, with guided tours on request; call (413) 774-1480. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
