The man who had carried the Cubs this far was getting a well-deserved ride.\n\"Three cheers for Jake Arrieta!\" a voice in a jubilant Cubs clubhouse yelled.\nThree collective claps later, bedlam ensued. Rookie star Kris Bryant sprayed champagne and President Theo Epstein chugged it as teammates hugged and music blared. The pleasure easily exceeded the pressure.\nSome will call the celebration over the top for only one win, but Chicagoans know it represented so much more. The Cubs were the better team in a do-or-die situation in October and rose to the occasion in a playoff game. What a rare thing to say about the Cubs.\n\"I could not be more proud of a group of guys than I was tonight,\" manager Joe Maddon said.\nOn the same night the Blackhawks hoisted a Stanley Cup banner back in Chicago, the Cubs raised expectations along the Allegheny River. Before the first pitch of the wild-card game at PNC Park, the public-address announcer proclaimed to the crowd of 40,889, the ballpark's largest ever, \"It's the beginning of Buc-tober!\"\nCubs' locker room celebration after win The Cubs celebrate their victory over the Pirates in the wild-card game.\nThe Cubs celebrate their victory over the Pirates in the wild-card game.\nSee more videos But calendars mean nothing to a Cubs team considered ahead of schedule and unwilling to wait till next year like so many others have.\nNobody epitomizes the Cubs' accelerated pace of development more than Kyle Schwarber, the fourth pick of the 2014 amateur draft and the first Cub who will come to mind in 10 years when you recall this night.\nSchwarber's season began April 9 in Pearl, Miss., catching a Double-A game for the Tennessee Smokies, and it peaked six months later at PNC Park, playing right field against the Pirates in the Cubs' most significant moment in years. Schwarber hit a two-run home run over the right-field wall, out of the ballpark and into Cubs lore.\nWith one swing of the bat, the 22-year-old who looks more like a Bears fullback turned the wild-card game into the Kyle Schwarber Game.\n\"I'm just thankful I'm here to help the team — this is a special group,\" Schwarber said. \"It was a good feeling and came off solid. It was a big situation.\"\nCaption Cubs fans celebrate Chicago Cubs fans celebrate in Wrigleyville after the Cubs defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates to advance to the National League Division Series.

Oct. 7, 2015. (Armando Sanchez / Chicago Tribune)\nCaption Arrieta speaks during clubhouse celebration Arrieta speaks during clubhouse celebration Oct. 7, 2015. (WGN-TV) Arrieta speaks during clubhouse celebration Oct. 7, 2015. (WGN-TV) By the top of the third, thanks to the homer and his first-inning RBI single, it was Schwarber 3, Pirates 0. The lineup Maddon employed worked, of course. Everybody from the people in the Cubs dugout to those in Wrigleyville bars knew what that meant with Arrieta on the mound. The right-hander hadn't given up four runs in a game since June 16. Heck, Arrieta had let only four runs score total since Aug. 1.\nCubs Chairman Tom Ricketts wanted to shed the \"Lovable Losers\" label traditionally attached to the team, and rest assured this experience went a long way toward doing so. Every lusty boo aimed at Maddon during pregame introductions — which he invited by cupping his ear and tipping his cap — and every \"ARR-I-ET-A!\" chant illustrated how far the Cubs had come. Envy so often comes disguised as hate.\nThe animus boiled over in the seventh when reliever Tony Watson hit Arrieta in the buttocks, retaliation for Arrieta hitting two Pirates hitters. Benches cleared after Arrieta said something on his way to first base, with Pirates first baseman Sean Rodriguez and Dexter Fowler leading the jawing. Once the committee meeting dressed as a baseball melee ended nonviolently, Rodriguez went all Carlos Zambrano on the Gatorade cooler in the dugout because, he claimed, a Cubs player choked him.\nFor the record, the team that lost its composure and resorted to desperation in an elimination game was not the Cubs. The Cubs were the team that got inside the head of its opponent, not something that happens every October — or any October.\nArrieta elevated his game the way Chicago has come to expect during one of the most dominant extended stretches our city has seen, keeping historical company with guys such as Michael Jordan during the 1990s, Rick Sutcliffe in 1984 and Duncan Keith last spring.\nMaddon compared Arrieta's performance to former Cardinals great Bob Gibson — in terms of edginess too. When a reporter prefaced a postgame question by saying Arrieta didn't have his best stuff, he snapped, \"I'm not sure what game you were watching.\"\nBesides loading the bases in the sixth, Arrieta again resembled the most unhittable pitcher in baseball by giving up a measly four hits and striking out 11 against the second-best team in the majors. Yet perhaps Arrieta's most satisfying moment came on the basepaths after he stole second on the first pitch after the brawl, the perfect response and probably not easy to pull off while smirking.\nA Pittsburgh TV station had circulated on its website instructions for fans to rattle Arrieta with chants by the inning. Nothing worked as Arrieta, who invited the abuse on Twitter, reacted as unfazed as ever. Counterpart Gerrit Cole paled in comparison.\nThe Cole reality: The Pirates ace didn't have it, giving up four runs in five innings, including two home runs he will think about until spring training. He came in having yielded only one extra-base hit to the Cubs in four starts but struggled with his usual command, especially early when adrenaline appeared to affect his control.\nAfter Dexter Fowler homered in the fifth, a chorus of \"Let's go, Cubbies!\" broke out in the seats behind the Cubs dugout as Pirates fans sat in silence, stunned. Fans dressed in black started flocking to the exits in the eighth. They knew what everybody now knows: The Cubs are talking World Series and demanding to be taken seriously.\nMaddon compared the play-in game to the Super Bowl, but truth is, as monumental as the moment felt, it merely represents the equivalent of the Hawks eliminating the Predators in the first round. Three series remain before anybody needs to worry about parade planning. But suddenly the Cubs look capable of making what once seemed wildly impossible possible.\nBring on the Cardinals. Alert the Mets and Dodgers. Make no small plans for early November, North Siders. Nothing fazes this Cubs team that fears nothing.\ndhaugh@tribpub.com\nTwitter @DavidHaugh\nPrivacy Policy Copyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Major League Baseball Baseball Chicago Cubs Jake Arrieta Pittsburgh Pirates Joe Maddon Chicago Blackhawks", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5615ee54/turbine/ct-cubs-celebration-video-spt-20151007", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5615eec8/turbine/ct-cubs-fans-celebrate-video-20151007", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5615f50e/turbine/ct-haugh-cubs-pirates-wild-card-kyle-schwarber-spt-1008-20151007", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5615e76b/turbine/ct-arrieta-clubhouse-celebration-video-20151007"], "published": "2015-10-08T07:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:27:18.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
