But the ever grounded Prabhas expressed in a recent interview that the success of any film should be attributed to its team and not to the star. Baahubali - The Beginning (Telugu) (U/A): Book Your Tickets Right Away! \n\"This success has taught me that a star alone can't be credited for a film's success, which is usually achieved by a team. No star is bigger than the success of a film,\" Prabhas opined. \nThe success of Baahubali, according to the Rebel star, belongs to every last member of the team, who worked tirelessly to ensure a smooth release. \n\"Firstly, it's not easy to make a film on such a grand scale. The bigger challenge nowadays is to take a film to the theatres. In our case, we didn't face any difficulty in releasing, which was only possible because of meticulous planning and team work,\" he said. \nDespite appreciations pouring in from all quarters for his performance, Prabhas doesn't consider himself a national star yet. \n\"It felt nice when stars like Ranbir Kapoor and Shah Rukh Khan appreciated my performance. Rajinikanth sir called and congratulated me. Such things have never happened before. I'm glad I'm popular, people recognise wherever I go, but it's too early to be called a national star,\" he said. \nWell! Now isn't that a straight talk from the actor? No wonder he is largely appreciated for his simplicity and grounded nature by his friends and fans.

Since my shoulder surgery, I haven't been in the best shape as I was advised not to work out. Now that I'm doing much better, I'll start gymming soon. I weighed around 95 kg in the first part, I have to maintain it and look muscular too,\" he said. INTERVIEW: Prabhas Disowns Baahubali Success 2/6 Hurrying Up For Films \n\"Even if I was required to spend four years, I'd have happily worked. An opportunity such as this you get once in a lifetime and it'd be stupid to jeopardize it,\" Prabhas said. INTERVIEW: Prabhas Disowns Baahubali Success 3/6 About Rajamouli and Producers \n\"If Rajamouli is the brain and heart of 'Baahubali', the producers are its skeleton, holding everything together and the fans are the blood. Rajamouli deserves all the laurels, but he's so modest that he diverts all of it towards his team,\" Prabhas said. INTERVIEW: Prabhas Disowns Baahubali Success 4/6 Other Languages \n\"When a film of this scale is made, you want it to be a blockbuster because mere success won't help the producers recover money. What surprised us the most was that the film did extremely well in Tamil, Hindi and Malayalam too,\" said Prabhas, who'd like to thank Rajamouli the most for this success. INTERVIEW: Prabhas Disowns Baahubali Success 5/6 TV Premiere \n\"I hope it becomes the most viewed Indian film on television. It's quite possible as this is not some regular commercial film that you watch once and forget. My cousins, who've already watched it a few times, have said that the experience had gotten better with each viewing,\" he said, and added it will be the perfect treat for families this Dussehra festival.
