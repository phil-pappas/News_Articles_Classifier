That includes looking back on her vintage episode of ​Cribs ​ and revealing something your inner 12-year-old fangirl will be shocked to hear.\n Basically, you know Jojo's house from that Cribs episode? Well, it totally wasn't her house.\n\"It was so ridiculous,\" Jojo revealed to The Huffington Post about her stint on the show that gave you a behind-the-scenes look at celebs' fabulous houses. \"The thing is, we didn't have a home at that point. My mom and I were living out of suitcases and we were mostly in hotels. So that was actually my uncle's house, on the Cape. That wasn't my house. That wasn't my stuff. When I was sitting on the spinny thing, that was his kids'. That's the truth. I should've balled hard, and been like, 'Welcome to my crib, look at how luxurious it is,' and I should have rented out a place. But no. I just used my uncle's crib. So that was me lying on Cribs .\"\nMore From Cosmopolitan Yep. You got duped. Now watch Jojo give you a tour of her uncle's completely basic, this-could-literally-be-your-house pad and prepare to love her even more. Not sure what gave away Jojo's massive fake-out more: her own shocked expression at her uncle's dirty shower (he couldn't clean before the crew arrived?), or her hilariously pathetic attempts to make the house look like it was hers (look at that ​one ​ pair of heels in the closet and that carton of Pistachio Pistachio Ben and Jerry' s ice cream in the otherwise ​empty fridge... soooo convincing).\nBut can you really blame Jojo for faking it? When you're asked to be on ​MTV Cribs ​, you make it happen! And seriously, what 13-year-old has their own ridiculously awesome house? Give her a break!", "external_links": ["http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jojo-interview-comeback_5612df41e4b022a4ce5f1618", "http://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/news/a33942/jojo-relives-her-get-out-music-video-a-decade-later/"], "published": "2015-10-08T18:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:26:16.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
