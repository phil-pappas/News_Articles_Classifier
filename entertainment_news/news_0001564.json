It’s back to girls vs boys (Boundless/BBC) \nThe teams, switched back to girls vs boys, were also told they would have to pitch their product to industry experts before Lord Sugar – their “prickly customer”– decided who would get the chop. \nSalon owner Charleine Wain went head-to-head with hair extension entrepreneur and inventor of a heated hair bun, Aisha Kasim, for leadership of the girls, but Aisha’s experience won out. \nThe boys selected Richard Woods, director of a digital marketing agency for eight years, but who Baroness Brady branded as like someone who had “bought a management book and read it cover to cover before coming here”. Brett takes a leading role (Boundless/BBC) \nBrett Butler-Smythe suggested the tagline, “Live life rough then make it smooth”, while Scott Saunders struggled with both the spelling of cactus and desert. They eventually settled on the name “Western – for Desert Dry Hair”. \nTaking their cowboy shoot-’em-up suggestion lightly, Joseph Valente put his gardening skills to good use by utilising a bucket and watering can for the boys’ soapy billboard shoot. \nOver on the girls’ team, dictatorial Aisha accepted her team’s plan to target the “grey pound” or over-50s market but hired two unsuitable 20-something models for her billboard campaign. Claude was no help in the shampoo brainstorming sesh (Boundless/BBC) \nLuckily good sport Ruth Whiteley was willing to get into the spirit of it as she became the face of “Desert Secrets” and their cactus-flower bottle. \nInevitably, when the other half of the teams tackled the TV adverts, their brand continuity went from bad to worse. \nAnd a dry pitch from one team and a tongue-tied delivery from the other had industry bosses wincing as nerves took over.
