This is the second installment and comes hot on the heels of the debut program, which was held in July.\nSome of the world's largest businesses have been building user-centric design competence within their organizations. Some have been extremely successful in utilizing these approaches, others are on their journey. Idean noticed one of the largest gaps for building a robust internal capability is leadership, and created a training program to address the needs of today's design leaders and executives.\nThe Idean Design Leadership Academy consists of a three-day program centered on three themes: Building Organizational Competency, Practicing Modern Experience Design Tools and Design Leadership Playbook. The teaching techniques used in the training are structured to lead students from Inspiration, Practical Tools, to Immersion; and, it is proven to help participants take back and implement into their organization.\nRisto Lahdesmaki, Co-Founder and CEO of Idean, said, \"We have been working with some of the most well-known brands in the world to deliver design and digital solutions for the last 16 years. We are always being asked by our clients what we can do to help support them in their role, beyond the projects we deliver.\"\n\"We came up with the idea of creating a specific three-day design leadership program to help them take design transformation to the next level, from understanding the true value of user-centric design, to leading and supporting an organization's design culture.\"\n\"It was extremely important for us to include post-graduate support, as we understand that the learning and questions don't stop after the course,\" Lahdesmaki continued. \"By creating an online platform, we're giving people the opportunity to ask specific questions and help them find their way in this ever-changing landscape.\"\n\"It's a lot of fun: interactive lectures, opportunity to listen and to share our experiences, hands-on activities. The fun aspect enables participants to try, experience and listen all at the same time, which makes it more interesting to learn,\" said John Suh , Executive Director, Hyundai Ventures, who attended the first Idean Design Leadership Academy. \"I believe the Idean Design Academy is suitable for anybody who has to work with people or is trying to collaborate or create products or services. There is a great need to have an appreciation and understanding empathy for another person.\"\nThe Idean Design Leadership Academy costs $9,995 USD and is held 6-8 th October 2015 in Menlo Park, California .\nFor more information about Idean visit www.idean.com or for further information about the Academy visit www.idean.com/academy\nABOUT IDEAN\nIdean is a global design firm that works with the world's leading companies, helping them to create long-lasting relationships with their customers, through truly enchanting experiences.\nSince 1999, Idean has helped thousands of clients around the world to maximize the value of their digital solutions with strong multicultural experience, a multidisciplinary team and a diverse design portfolio covering various different platforms and devices from tablets to heavy-lifting industrial machinery.\nWith a team of more than 150 designers, technologists and strategists, Idean has worked with GoPro, HP, Cisco, 23andMe, Sony, IBM, Samsung and GE Healthcare amongst others.
