Dumaplin\nOctober 6, 2015 Kamikazee\nBest known for the hits “Narda,” “Wala” and “Chiksilog,” wacky band Kamikazee up for hiatus in 2016 will hold its final show in December. Though details have not been announced, the hashtag #KamikazeeHulingSayaw is making the rounds on social media. The band’s fans called Romanticos (after their fourth album “Romantico”) have been taking to Facebook to express their views on Kamikazee’s hiatus.\nParokya ni Edgar (PNE) frontman Chito Miranda described a recent true-to-form Kamikazee performance at a bar in Makati “epic,” deeming it something he won’t forget for a long time. PNE members jestingly refer to Kamikazee as their “sister band.”\nOn Kamikazee’s Twitter page, the band said, “Maraming salamat sa inyong lahat, pasensya na sa mga hindi nakapasok (sa bar), bawi kami sa December! Mahal namin kayo.”\nFormed in 2000, Kamikazee is composed of Contreras, Jomal Linao and Led Tuyay on lead guitars, Jason “Puto” Astete on bass, and Allan “Bords” Burdeos on drums.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:39:40.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
