Acting, she said, “chose me.” \nBlanchett starred in two films at the festival: Haynes’ 1950s-set lesbian romance “Carol” and James Vanderbilt’s “Truth,” in which she plays TV news producer Mary Mapes, who was fired over a story about former U.S. President George W. Bush’s military service. \nAmerican director Robert Eggers’ Pilgrim horror film “The Witch” won the festival’s first-feature prize. Jennifer Peedom’s Himalayan study “Sherpa” was named best documentary and “An Old Dog’s Diary” by Shai Heredia and Shumona Goel took the short-film trophy. \nThe 59th annual London festival aimed to put strong women center stage, opening with Sarah Gavron’s political drama “Suffragette” and featuring 46 female-directed films among its 240 features. \nThe 12-day event brought a slew of awards-worthy female performances, including Blanchett and Rooney Mara as clandestine lovers in “Carol,” Brie Larson as a mother in an extreme situation in “Room,” and Maggie Smith as a redoubtable eccentric in “The Lady in the Van.” \nFounded in 1957 to show the best of the year’s world cinema to a British audience, the London Film Festival has boosted its profile in recent years with bigger movies, more glittering stars and prizes to boost emerging awards-season contenders. \nIts prize-winners have a strong track record at the Oscars. The last two London winners, Andrey Zvyagintsev’s “Leviathan” and Pawlikowski’s “Ida,” faced off in this year’s foreign-language Academy Award race. “Ida” won. \nThe festival wraps up Sunday with Danny Boyle’s “Steve Jobs,” starring Michael Fassbender as the Apple founder. \n___ \nFollow Jill Lawless on Twitter at http://Twitter.com/JillLawless Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:04:34.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
