We tell our artists which parts they can paint on. Everybody follows the rules.\n\"Also we've introduced lots of events, like street dance and tattooing as well as graffiti.\"\nCheng says before the derelict square was transformed, it was mainly used by the homeless.\nTurning tide \nLocal graffiti artist Bio, 25, sees the area as an opportunity to make a mark on the city without the risk of arrest.\n\"Graffiti doesn't always have to be a bad thing,\" he says.\n\"It makes a place shine... More and more people come here to take photos.\"\nThe authorities' new approach is a far cry from the previous zero-tolerance approach which saw one leading political artist, BBrother, prosecuted and given a three to five-year jail sentence in 2006 for illegal graffiti in Taipei.\nThe lawsuit was dropped after an online petition.\nThere is no law that specifically targets graffiti, but artists can be punished for damaging property, incurring up to a five year jail sentence, although authorities say they rarely impose penalties.\n\"In the past, government agencies tended to ban and banish graffiti because of public sentiment,\" a spokesman for Taiwan's culture ministry told AFP.\n\"But it has gradually become part of living spaces as people's acceptance and knowledge of graffiti art has grown.\"\nTaipei has 10 legal graffiti zones while central Taichung City has seven areas.\nLocal officials in southern Taiwan are planning a similar district in Kaohsiung City after the successful revitalisation of a defunct railway repair station.\nThe city's Jiuru Street Art Factory became one of Taiwan's first legalised graffiti areas in 2011 when the railway company gave permission for artists to take over the space.\nThrill seekers \nFor Amos, a 29-year-old graffiti artist in Taichung, Taiwan's street art scene still has some way to go compared with what he sees in China, Japan, and in New York.\n\"There have been a lot of graffiti events in China in recent years, mostly government funded,\" he says.\n\"It can make a city feel younger, livelier.\"\nHe also says that while legalised zones are useful, illegal graffiti will still flourish.\n\"Those who do graffiti tend to have a rebellious streak. They may go to the designated areas but they will still roam the streets,\" he told AFP.\n\"Those who go to paint in the zones are artists who want to create a complete work or to learn and teach.\"\nAmos shares his graffiti online and via Instagram, often featuring his trademark \"Big Teeth Bear\" -- a blue animal with bulging teeth and a red eye patch -- seen along freeways, under bridges, or in cargo areas.\nTaipei artist Bio agrees that some will not be able to resist flouting the rules.\nHe has been arrested once for illegal graffiti and says his punishment was to clean it off as he could not afford the Tw$200,000 ($6,000) fine.\nIt has not deterred him from exploring forbidden canvasses.\n\"I understand the government prefers us to do this (legal graffiti) and I respect that... but there's always a little devil in my heart. We don't want to be restricted. That's our spirit.\"\nThe government acknowledges the sanctioned parks will not stamp out illegal graffiti, but says it will continue with its policy to enhance the urban landscape.\n\"Some graffiti artists may think legalising it will greatly diminish the thrill,\" says the culture ministry.\n\"But for the public, and the appearance of the city, it makes sense.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:05:15.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
