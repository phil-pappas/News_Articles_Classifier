You can't say that either. But of course, like other LGBT people, I have a sense of camp, and I'm ready with the soundbites, but what this movie does is that's what the character exclusively focuses on. I get it — the character is a catalyst, a supporting role. You don't see the behind the scenes negotiation. The movie didn't show the inside game. But if the movie's going to further the understanding of how we won equality, I'm happy. I've seen it six times, with friends and family. There are moments where they say, 'Steven, that's you' and moments where they say, 'I don't know who that is.'\"\nMany of the lines in the film are verbatim from the battle to award Hester's domestic partner her pension, but some, Goldstein says, \"are simply preposterous,\" and he also says the \"catfight\" between him and Hester's supportive police partner, played by Michael Shannon, never happened.", "external_links": ["http://www.out.com/michael-musto/2015/10/05/10-movies-where-gay-was-taken-out", "http://www.out.com/michael-musto/2015/10/09/real-life-steven-goldstein-has-problem-freeheld", "https://twitter.com/StvenGoldstein/status/633072305590173700"], "published": "2015-10-09T20:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:11:39.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
