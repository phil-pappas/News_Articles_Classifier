The author spent years in hiding with heavy security after his novel \"The Satanic Verses\" drew a death edict from Iran's religious authorities.\nFair director Juergen Boos said Monday that he regrets the cancellation by Iran's culture ministry and hopes this year's absence of an Iranian national stand will only be \"a short interruption.\" But he added that free speech \"is not negotiable.\"\nBook fair organizers said a few Iranian publishers are still expected at this year's event.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
