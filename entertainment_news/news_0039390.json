It doesn't belong on the street. And we shouldn't be without Paul Walker or his friend, Roger Rodas,\" Meadow Walker's lawyer, Jeff Milam, told ABC News regarding the suit filed Monday in California Superior Court. The lawsuit does not state the monetary amount in damages being sought by the plaintiff. \n  Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 12:00PM by", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T12:23:45.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
