Heck, it'll probably get its own spinoff. (\"Khloe and Lamar Take the ICU\"?)\nGiven recent trends, it probably won't hit the air until long after everyone's stopped talking about it.\nBut that should give the show's producers, who've famously made \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" one of reality TV's least real shows, plenty of time to get Khloe to a hospital set somewhere in L.A. so she can re-create that grief.\nContact Christopher Lawrence at clawrence@reviewjournal.com .
