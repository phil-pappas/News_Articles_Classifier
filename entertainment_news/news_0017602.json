The program pragmatically balances the health of the environment with South Carolina’s demand for seafood by working with consumers and chefs, helping them make wise seafood choices to support healthy, abundant oceans. More than 115 restaurant partners have committed to serve and purchase sustainable seafood whenever possible and to avoid species that are immediately vulnerable to extinction. As a community, when we choose seafood from local, sustainably managed fisheries or dine at restaurants which do the same, we minimize our impact on the environment.
