Scratch that: He can’t even get in the cage, well, unless to shadowbox.\nAlvey’s estranged wife Christina (Joanna Going) struggles to rebuild her life by working in a fast-food place and getting high with her manager.\nYoungest son Nate (Nick Jonas) is in training, so he’s sworn off sex — with his girlfriend. He can’t resist checking out guys on his cellphone.\nJonas, who is doing double duty on Fox’s “Scream Queens,” is convincing as the closeted young fighter. Every time his father Alvey tells him how proud he is of him, Jonas communicates the weight of his secret.\nPerhaps in a nod to the popularity of UFC superstar Ronda Rousey, “Kingdom” introduces an aspiring fighter­ named Alicia Mendez (Natalie Martinez, “Secrets and Lies”). Whatever the reason, it’s a smart call. Alicia agrees to let Lisa manage her in the hope of getting a chance to train with Alvey — but Alvey doesn’t seem interested.\nThanks to stunt coordinator Keith Campbell, “Kingdom’s” fight choreography continues to thrill. The drama, already renewed for a third season, has an ear for honest humor, the way people bust on each other. Sometimes the show is too cinema verite for its own good.\nA scene in which two characters cross paths and promise to talk to each other later is a minute of your time you and the show will never get back.\nFor “Kingdom” to be champion, it needs to cut the fat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:19:42.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
