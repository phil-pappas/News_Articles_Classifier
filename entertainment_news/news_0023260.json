Plan on being surprised at this BYOW, because menu descriptions only suggest what an item is all about.\nTake, for instance, the Scotch egg with greens ($11). The line beneath its name, \"Pears, maple bacon vinaigrette and Grana Padano\" didn't entirely warn me that this would not be the usual sausage-covered egg coated in breadcrumbs.\nWe got the crumbs, in the form of panko , but there was no sausage. Instead, the cheese-dusted egg was served amid a salad dressed in the bacon vinaigrette, with sliced pears on the side.\nIf someone were set on biting into the sausage, they might have been disappointed, but with no preconceptions, I enjoyed this lighter version of the dish that took expectations and reorganized them.\nAnother twist, serving red quinoa with a coulotte steak ($28), ditched the traditional potato pairing for something that again was lighter, not to mention fluffier. Grilled Romaine and a sherry vinaigrette dressing heightened the impact of the meat, because it set off its flavor and texture in such a different way.\nAn egg, sunny side up, and onion straws do the same for the Kobe burger ($17) with roasted garlic aoili on a toasted brioche.\nTenderhill chef/owner Ethan Oh at work. Andrew Miller|For NJ Advance Media Elements of a dish change regularly; variety is the spice of Tenderhill's existence. Recently, the coulotte was replaced with a rib-eye ($34). Roast chicken for two ($38) is a staple in various iterations, but at some point in the rotation, it will involve poulet rouge, a French heritage chicken.\n\"It's not a variety you see very often, but it's prepared in a way that's approachable and speaks very well of the Tenderhill spirit,\" he explained.\nThat spirit also involves freshly harvested and foraged greens, all local or from the restaurant's own garden.\nWhen coming to Tenderhill, always anticipate innovation, as in gnocchi ($16) set off dramatically by peas, corn, charred green onions, caramelized onions and an eggplant purée. The odds are you've never had anything remotely similar.\nAmong the array of influences that make Tenderhill so fascinating are dishes with Asian elements. Shiso , also known as Japanese basil, is a favorite addition. Items with far Eastern roots include the soy-glazed pork bun ($8.50), prepared with braised pork belly, embellished by pickled daikon and pickled onion. Or try Korean BBQ roast beef ($13), jazzed with an array of add-ons--pickled onion, pickled jalapeño, napa cabbage, spicy aioli and taro chips.\nThey're part of a cuisine with which Oh is at home. Born in South Korea, he came to the U.S. at age eight. The chef earned a degree in East Asian studies from Rutgers, where he also obtained a bachelor's in graphic design, both concentrations that seem to have influenced his cooking and plate arrangements.\nHe did a stint in culinary school, but got what he sought from it and left before graduating to pursue other avenues. Three months after he opened the Flying Milk Bar in Whitehouse Station, the place burned down. He had to wait for the insurance settlement, making good use of the time with stints in various jobs at restaurants around New York City, where he worked at Neta and Morimoto, among others.\nTenderhill, a name that incorporates a location at the foot of the Cushetunk mountains, was built on the site of the Milk Bar with encouragement from his father and partner, Benjamin Oh. It debuted during the summer, starting with lunch and adding dinner in August.\nThe space that seats 56 has a no-frills utilitarian feel, which Oh calls urban rustic, leaving the focus on the food. The open kitchen enables patrons to see Oh and the other chef, Tenderhill Scotch egg innovator David Kim, a veteran of New York's Momoya, plying their considerable skills.\nThe interior of Tenderhill in Whitehouse Station.

A rich ice cream sandwich ($5.50), made with luscious chocolate chip cookies, was filled with house-made vanilla ice cream. The same ice cream graces fruit pies ($8), classics that again take advantage of the season.\nThe food at Tenderhill is not only beautifully prepared, but also entertaining, as in \"what will they come up with next?\"\nWhy not find out for yourself?\nIF YOU GO\nTenderhill, 405 Route 22 East, Whitehouse Station.
