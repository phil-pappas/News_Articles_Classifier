And it happens just as often in real life, too, when you add junk food at the last minute to your grocery cart, even though you should know better.

To understand more about that — and how you can use this psychological principle to make better purchasing decisions — watch the latest episode of our five-part Science of Us series \"This Is Your Brain on Advertising.\" After that, check out the previous episode, about how your feelings for your favorite brands seem an awful lot like the feelings you have for your friends — at least at a neurological level.
