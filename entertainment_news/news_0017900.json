Now he's going to take the big stage at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. -- as well as theaters in several other cities. Lamar Odom takes steps in Los Angeles... \nThe tour, called \"Tracy Morgan: Picking Up the Pieces,\" will begin in Hammond, Indiana, on February 5. Morgan is scheduled to play a number of casino venues and notable theaters, including Boston's Wilbur Theatre (February 20), Connecticut's Grand Theater at Foxwoods (March 19) and Las Vegas' Mirage Hotel and Casino (May 6-7). \nThe Washington show, part of Comedy at the Kennedy Center, will be April 22. \n\"It's just like falling off a bike and getting back on, that's all -- you don't forget where the pedals are,\" Morgan said in a Kennedy Center press release. \nMorgan was seriously injured in June 2014 after a Walmart truck slammed into the limo occupied by Morgan and four others on the New Jersey Turnpike. Morgan was hospitalized with broken ribs, a broken nose, and a broken leg. His friend, comedian James McNair, was killed. \nWalmart settled lawsuits by McNair's family, Morgan and other injured passengers for undisclosed amounts earlier this year. \nMorgan's appearance on \"SNL\" was highlighted by a strong monologue, which included a reunion of his \"30 Rock\" colleagues. \n\"People were wondering, 'Can he speak? Does he have 100 percent mental capacity?' But the truth is I never did,\" Morgan said to big laughs opening the show. \"I might actually be a few points higher now.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T11:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T12:27:12.857+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
