Still, a \"handful\" are still unable to access funds. \n\"We are working to contact them individually to assist them with their needs,\" the company said in a statement. \nIn the same statement, RushCard said they will soon make a \"significant announcement\" to help customers who took a financial hit. \nDespite the company's assertion that the problems have been resolved, several RushCard customers have emailed or called The Associated Press as late as Thursday afternoon to say they remain without access to funds. \nA technology upgrade rolled out Oct. 12 caused thousands of RushCards to show a zero balance or become invalid. RushCard customers, mostly poor people without a bank account, had no access to their paychecks for more than a week. Some were unable to pay bills on time or buy food and other necessities.
