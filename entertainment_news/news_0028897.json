This is the question worrying top actress Anushka Shetty. She has been approached for an item song featuring Stylish Star Allu Arjun in his next project Sarainodu.\nApparently, Anushka is in a fix whether to say yes or no to shaking a leg with Bunny. Her latest Telugu movie Rudramadevi is doing decent business in theatres. Two of her films, in Telugu and Tamil respectively, are currently in the post-production stage. She has signed two big budget Tamil movies which will go on the floor soon. The actress, we hear, is in a dilemma.\n\"Many actresses face this strange request from top filmmakers. Unfortunately, Anushka is not clear about dancing to an item number at this juncture in her career. The news has already spread that she will be doing the song, but nothing has been confirmed so far,\" a source from Hyderabad told Bangalore Mirror.\nAllu Arjun and Anushka had romanced on the big screen in Telugu movie Vedam in 2010. The problem for Anushka is that she was seen in an item number in the Tamil movie Singam 2, which was a sequel to Singam in which Anushka played the female lead and the continuation of her character was maintained. She is also likely to be part of Singam 3.\nSarainodu is being directed by Boyapati Srinu and is produced by Allu Arjun's home banner. The movie has Rakul Preet Singh and Catherine Tresa as the female leads. A major portion of the movie's shooting has been completed. SS Thaman has composed the music for the movie.\nItem songs in Allu Arjun movies form a highlight and many of them have been chartbusters. But Anushka, at this stage of her career, does not need to deliver hit item numbers. Nevertheless, efforts are on to convince her to dance with Bunny for the song.\nSarainodu is an action-drama and is expected to hit the screens during Sankranti. The post-production will commence in December and before that the director wants to wrap up shooting of the item song.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T06:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T22:34:32.998+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
