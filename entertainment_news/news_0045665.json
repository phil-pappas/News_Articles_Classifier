No contemporary novelist makes me stop as often to mark or admire one of her sentences.\nThe possible line of inspirational coffee mugs derived from her new novel, “Days of Awe,” will include such perky thoughts as “You can’t preserve anything; every happy moment is already on its way to becoming nostalgia” and “Death smashes a crater into your life, and you’re left alone to sort through the rubble.”\nMore Information Days of Awe: A Novel\nBy Lauren Fox\nKnopf, $24.95\n“Days of Awe” draws its title from the period of the solemn introspection urged upon Jews between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, though Fox’s narrator, Isabel Applebaum Moore , also experiences gentler moments of wonder and appreciation.\nThe novel opens at the funeral of Josie, Isabel’s fellow middle-school teacher, who died in a late-night car crash. “She would always be my wild, grieving, huge-hearted, selfish, confident, insecure, extravagant best friend,” Isabel tells us.\nMoving backward and forward, Isabel recounts the history of their friendship while unraveling the skein of events and decisions that led to her death. Josie had been married to Mark, Isabel’s childhood buddy and Hebrew school classmate; Izzy and her husband, the gentle gentile Chris, often hung out with them. The more outgoing Josie seizes Isabel as a BFF on the day they meet, bonding over inanities at a faculty meeting; readers will detect, almost immediately, edgy and manic notes in her behavior.\nIntersecting the horizontal axis of the couples, Fox gives us the vertical of Izzy with her mother Helene and her daughter Hannah, 11 at the outset. Were “Days of Awe” the pilot script for a TV series, elderly actresses would throw elbows to audition for Helene, who escaped the Holocaust as a little girl, unlike her relatives, and lets no one, particularly Izzy, forget that. Eyeballing a contender for Izzy’s affection, Helene whispers to her, “Is he the kind of person who would hide us in an attic?”\nBut Helene, in the aftermath of a stroke, faces her own diminishment gloomily, unnerving Izzy, the 43-year-old daughter who still depends on her emotionally.\nAs for the stormy Hannah, she is Izzy’s only child, born in the midst of multiple miscarriages. In a novel that depicts a woman processing several kinds of losses, none hit harder in fewer words than these: “I didn’t think of them as babies. They weren’t. They were pieces of me, though: secrets, sweet hazy dreams, the thrumming anticipation of surprises. I guarded them tenderly, selfishly, and so when they were gone I grieved them like amputations, silent deaths, down, down, deep at the center of me.”", "external_links": ["http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/15/72/8707716/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/15/72/8707716/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-03T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:33:11.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
