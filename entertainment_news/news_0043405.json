She teamed with Rudsak founder and head designer Evik Asatoorian in designing a limited-edition leather jacket. \n“For me, the Rudsak collaboration is all about creating something for the modern woman who has to live life on Earth — not on stage,” Haines said in a phone interview from Berlin. \n“And the jacket that we’ve designed is as suitable for a working professional woman, or a mother, or a rock ‘n’ roller. It’s not about showing off. It’s about function and elegance.” \nHaines said she came to the process with “zero experience,” but wasn’t surprised to see the level of care required to design a new garment. \n“That’s true, I think, for every craft. But it was amazing to see how Evik works and to see the huge spectrum of fabrics and materials and options, and the qualities of the leathers that they’re using and all the workmanship…. My idea, I thought, was maybe a bit out there. But Evik was really excited and got behind it right away.” \nAsatoorian said Haines’s rock star image was the ideal fit with the label, which has prided itself on its “cool rebel” signature look after two decades in business. \n“We started looking at her lifestyle, what are a true rock star’s needs, and what does she wish to have,” he said. “She’s so talented —not only for music but even taste-wise. \n“It’s nice to know when a person says what her true passion on a product is … and she looks at it from outside the box.” \nHaines’s inaugural foray into fashion comes on the heels of Metric’s latest full-length album “Pagans In Vegas,” released last month. \n— Follow @lauren_larose on Twitter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:46:26.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
