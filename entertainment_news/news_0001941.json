It is one of the go-to places for scriptwriters seeking an agent or their first big writer’s job in the UK.\nThis year’s competition opens for entries October 8th and last entries are 10th December. The results will be announced in spring 2016.\nNow in its fourth year, the competition has its biggest ever panel of nearly 30 literary agents and senior television industry execs, including many senior BBC producers, a commissioning editor from C4, and development execs and producers from the independent sector. Organiser Philip Gladwin said he is seeking to place even more writers with agents, commissioning executives and producers than in previous years.\nA RARE OPPORTUNITY FOR UK SCREENWRITERS\nThe quality of previous winners’ screenplays and the fact that Phil has 20 years' experience in the industry has enabled Screenwriting Goldmine to attract top British TV industry names, from both production and literary management, to judge the contest.\nHimself a professional scriptwriter and currently Head of Development for a major London indie, Philip Gladwin said: “The Awards provide a rare and hugely valuable opportunity for aspiring screenwriters in the UK. We have some of the biggest TV companies in the world taking part, plus the public funding body Creative England, plus sponsorship from Final Draft, MindMeister, and Scrivener, industry leaders in scriptwriting software, mind mapping software and writers software respectively.\"\nSubmitted screenplays will be read not only by industry professionals actively looking for new material, and - most importantly - whose companies or associates are actively making films and TV drama.\n\"Each of our judges is guaranteed to read every single one of the short-listed scripts - and each of those short-listed writers will get to meet one or more of these executives\", Phil said. \"This is the real magic of the contest. It sweeps away years of knocking on doors by simply and directly connecting writers to the power-brokers.\"\nA PREVIOUS SUCCESS STORY\nOne outright winner, Jane Eden, went on to obtain representation after having three agents pitching to get her on their books.\nJane, in her own words: \"Things happened quickly after winning the Screenwriting Goldmine. I got a brilliant agent, started getting TV credits and a place on the C4 Screenwriting Course. The original work I created on the course was optioned, and I'm also developing several other ideas with independent production companies that I'm really happy to be working with.\nIf you've got a spec script, the Screenwriting Goldmine is a brilliant and rare opportunity to get your work read by industry people who are genuinely looking to find and champion new writers. I only entered to get a script report done, which you could pay a bit extra for, and now I'm a proper paid writer. I still can't quite believe it.\"\nTHAT BREAKTHROUGH MOMENT FOR UNDISCOVERED BRITISH SCREENWRITERS\nEach of the five finalists will be offered a one-to-one meeting with one of the judges selected from the panel.\nIn addition to a package of screenwriting support and software, the first prizewinner will take home £500, with cash prizes for the four other shortlisted finalists.\nWhat industry heads are saying about Screenwriting Goldmine Awards:\n\"The Screenwriting Goldmine competition consistently delivers professional standard winners and finalists who subsequently find agents and work. In an industry where it is still not easy for new writers to break through the competition provides a valuable service.\" Steve Matthews, Executive Producer, Drama Development at HBO Europe.\nSaid Roberto Troni, Commissioning Editor at C4 Drama: \"It's great that Screenwriting Goldmine is providing another route for emerging writers to have their voices heard.\"\nTanya Tillett, Literary Agent, The Agency, London, had this to say: \"It's wonderful that Screenwriting Goldmine is able to bring fresh new talent to the attention of people in the industry from their very first screenplay.\nHave your voice heard: check out the guidelines, read up on the judges and prizes at http://awards.screenwritinggoldmine.com , and then upload your best script – these Awards could be career-changing for you!\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb12999908.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb12999908.htm"], "published": "2015-10-08T18:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:50:35.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
