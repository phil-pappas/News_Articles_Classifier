Director Ridley Scott says filming his films in Australia hinges on Julie Bishop’s decision. Picture: Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP Bishop promised to take up the matter with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Treasurer Scott Morrison.\nSpeaking to News Corp Australia today, Scott confirmed the “really nice” meeting and said he’s now “living in hope”.\n“We’re hoping to bring a movie into Fox Studios in Sydney, well, kind of nowish, to start shooting round about end of Feb. It’s a big one, so it’s six month prep.\n“It’s really about trying to get a fair whack of the tax rebate — the problem is I’m not Australian, I’m English,” he said with a laugh. “But the whole, fundamental workforce will be Australians and some Australian actors.”\nOther Stories Daylight savings starts Sunday Nsw Boyd: The father I wish I’d had Nrl What’s the Buzz: Saint, Sinner, Shoosh Nrl 0 comments Bieber Island an expensive flop for Seven Sydney Confidential 0 comments Shocked mum slams ‘Toey Joey’ National Rowe’s crap housewife skills put to test Sydney Confidential 0 comments Ridley Scott sparks NASA conspiracy theory\nThe film Scott is angling to shoot here is the sequel to 2012’s Prometheus , which grossed $573 million worldwide and was itself a prequel to his 1979 classic Alien .\nThe new film will be called Alien: Paradise Lost and star Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender.\nBlockbuster ... Logan Marshall-Green, Noomi Rapace, and Michael Fassbender appeared in Ridley Scott’s 2012 film Prometheus Scott’s reasoning for banking on Australia is twofold: UK studios are overcrowded and the Australian landscape is suitably ‘alien’.\n“(London) now, probably is the biggest film city in the world. There’s like six studios and they’re all jammed full. Because of that, all the units and crews, there’s no one available. So that’s why as an Englishman I’m having to look elsewhere.\n“So I’m trying. I wanna find a pretty exotic landscape and some very big studio space — and Australia fits the bill.\n“And as you know I love Aussies, because I’ve worked with Russell Crowe five times, I’ve worked with Cate Blanchett once and Joel Edgerton, love him! So I’m an Aussie-phile.”\nIn a 2010 review of the screen industry, foreign production was said to be worth an average $175 million per year to the Australian economy, peaking at $279 million in 2003/4.\nThe rise of the Aussie dollar saw that average plummet over the past five years, but with the budget of Prometheus said to be $185 million, Alien: Paradise Lost could very well point the graph back in the right direction.\nLost opportunity ... the new blockbuster hit film The Martian starring Matt Damon was almost filmed in Australia but a leadership challenge in the government put a stop to it. Picture: Twentieth Century Fox Scott’s hopes to film Down Under have been dashed before by the Australian government.\nThe 77-year-old visited in May 2014 to scout desert locations for The Martian , but was stymied by our habit of leadership changes.\nHe and star Matt Damon ended up using the desert in Jordan and studios in Hungary instead.\n“There’s always a problem. At that moment, the problem was a change of Prime Minister,” Scott said. “There were decisions that had to be made that couldn’t be made at that particular moment.\n“I’ve got to move on because I’ve got my own schedule to maintain.”\nIn discussion ... Ridley Scott and Matt Damon talk about The Martian at the Toronto International Film Festival. Picture: Darren Calabrese/The Canadian Press Asked if he knew when he might expect an answer from Bishop or her colleagues regarding Alien: Paradise Lost , Scott replied: “Dunno, I’m waiting right now! I’ve got to get going pretty quick. If she says yes I’ll be there in a heartbeat.”\nScott was also unable to hide his excitement at The Martian opening atop the Australian box office, grossing $1.34 million yesterday.\n“Yes! Yay! It’s nice when that happens, you can’t sound cool about it. Every film is hard work, even bad films are hard work, so I always try to make good films. I feel particularly proud of this one.”\nOriginally published as Julie Bishop is Alien’s only hope", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/cd755904259f219f9f03f37588e3a7d1", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/4586b5d31da28a13c8f0d5d0d0e8ed18", "http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/ridley-scott-on-that-dinner-with-julie-bishop-and-his-hopes-to-film-in-australia/story-e6frfmvr-1227554366910?sv=7837998f20a20cef3f8fc798a559d9a3", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0b3b0504f7b896aafbc583f2c7d80217", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0df1b5ac636ccd1643e87f136e40e3b1?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/178fe2bd48863e31876402a309584284?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a32238c55f0819e988ff6f0fe0631e89", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c8d005b4d3c1ff476914c75620f43e5e?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f6f4e67ce499794be0262f7638a62bb1", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/7313194778383f9321a2a8402b35a310?width=650", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9f612afd371a92f7f0889222cfeec35b"], "published": "2015-10-02T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T22:27:43.466+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
