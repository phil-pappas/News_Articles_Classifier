To put that in perspective, the final episode of the BBC show had around three million more UK viewers than the Australia vs England Rugby World Cup match that sent the country into meltdown mode. \nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron jumped on the Bake Off bandwagon last week, saying that he loved the show and wanted Mrs Hussain to win because “she is so cool under pressure”. \nEven the British Finance Minister George Osborne got in on the act, tweeting his support for the 4ft 11’ cake baker from Leeds in northern England. Go Nadiya!! A brilliant Great British Bake Off final — George Osborne (@George_Osborne) October 7, 2015 \nThe popular series is set in a garden marquee with a conveyor belt of Victoria sponges and strawberry shortcakes. It’s as British as, well, tea and cake. \nFrom early on in the series, Mrs Hussain stood out on the show for her sense of humour, myriad of facial expressions and mouth watering creations, which included fizzy pop cheesecakes and eclair mountains in the shape of nuns.

It was in the fact she is just like everyone else. \n“She is the quietly brilliant girl next door, and someone you want to be mates with. She is what we might define as ‘quintessentially British’. Deeply humble — tick. Self-deprecating — tick. Unintentionally funny — tick.” \nNot everyone was as effusive. Mrs Hussain’s victory, “does not represent a watershed in British race or religious relations” or make any contribution to immigration debate, said the Telegraph ’s Kulei Hartley-Brown. “It was just a baking contest and she’s the woman who won.” \nMrs Hussain says she is acutely aware that some people may find her her appearance and religion confronting. \n“I was a bit nervous that people would look at me, a Muslim in a headscarf, and wonder if I could bake,” she told the Radio Times. \n“I hope that week by week people have realised that I can bake — and just because I’m not a stereotypical British person, it doesn’t mean that I am not into bunting, cake and tea. I’m just as British as anyone else.” \nOne of the Mr Hussain’s biggest fans has been her husband Abdal, a technical manager, who has been tweeting his support throughout the series. I am the proudest husband on the planet tonight. Maybe now you can believe in yourself Nadiya like I believe in you! #gbbo #BegumNadiya — Abdal Hussain (@AbdalAbuMDM) September 2, 2015 \n“I am never going to put boundaries on myself ever again,” Mrs Hussain said while clutching her prize - a crystal cake stand, “I’m never going to say ‘maybe’, I’m never going to say ‘I don’t think I can’. I can and I will.” To the amazing people who gave me this opportunity. To my gorgeous baker friends. What a ride .
