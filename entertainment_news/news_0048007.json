That went through his legs!\" Abby Wambach boomed on LIVE! with Kelly and Michael on Wednesday. In case you missed it, the United States soccer superstar from Pittsford appeared on the NBC morning show and had a lot of fun with hosts Kelly Ripa and Michael Strahan. After a brief interview segment in which Wambach talked about being the youngest of seven children and how her mother, Judy, actually wanted five more kids, they did a fun exercise. Wambach was going to teach Ripa how to convert a penalty shot on Strahan, the former NFL All-Pro defensive lineman.\nWith Strahan in full goalie get-up and Wambach and Ripa donning U.S. soccer jerseys, Wambach ripped her first shot right through Strahan's legs. They call that a nutmeg in soccer vernacular, but Abby went easy on Strahan. She didn't point out how that's a big deal in her sport, she just called for a replay.\nWhen asked about possibly retiring, she directed a question at Strahan, pointing that he went out on top by retiring after the Giants won the Super Bowl in 2012. Wambach is contemplating walking away after she and the Americans finally won the World Cup last summer, the country's first since 1999.\n\"I think you should play for as long as your heart is in it, bottom line,\" Strahan advised, \"because once you're done, you're done.\"\n\"Got it,\" Wambach said.\nThen Ripa asked specifically about next summer's Olympics and whether the two-time gold-medal-winning Wambach had decided to play.\n\"That's a good question. I don't know. ... I'm soul-searching. I've got to figure it out,\" Abby said.\nRipa, of course, urged her to stay for one more big tournament. Stay tuned. The Americans continue their World Cup victory tour on Oct. 21 in Seattle and Oct. 25 in Orlando against Brazil.", "external_links": ["http://c.brightcove.com/services/viewer/federated_f8/1691028013", "http://livekellyandmichael.dadt.com/features/video-archive/", "https://console.brightcove.com/services/amfgateway&servicesURL=http://services.brightcove.com/services&cdnURL=http://admin.brightcove.com&domain=embed&autoStart=false&", "http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash"], "published": "2015-10-08T16:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:03:47.554+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
