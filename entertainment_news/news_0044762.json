McDonald will perform a collection of songs from Cole Porter, Stephen Sondheim and George Gershwin, including a variety of popular Broadway hits and jazz standards. This will be her last Midwest appearance of the 2015-16 season. “Audra is currently the most sought-after Broadway singer and will eventually take her place as one of the legendary performers of the American Songbook,” said PSO music director George Stelluto. “This is truly an astounding opportunity for audiences in this region.” With a luminous soprano voice and a gift for dramatic truth-telling, McDonald has received six Tony Awards and two Grammy Awards, among numerous other accolades. Though she is classically trained — McDonald graduated from The Juilliard School in 1993— she is equally at home singing show tunes and opera. McDonald is also a highly successful film and television actress. She played Dr. Naomi Bennett in ABC’s “Private Practice,” and starred opposite Carrie Underwood in the live production of “The Sound of Music” on NBC in 2013. McDonald most recently starred as Billie Holiday on Broadway in “Lady Day at Emerson’s Bar and Grill,” and as Bess in Gershwin’s “Porgy and Bess,” winning Tony Awards for each. Tickets for the concert start at $40, student tickets at $21, and are available by calling 671-1096, by visiting the PSO box office at 101 State St., Peoria, or online at www.peoriasymphony.org . Box office hours are 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Journal Star Posted Oct. 9, 2015 at 3:30 PM Updated Oct 9, 2015 at 5:57 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T15:45:31.675+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
