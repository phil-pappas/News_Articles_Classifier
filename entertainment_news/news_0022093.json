In an interview with Cosmopolitan magazine for its 50th anniversary issue, Kendall revealed that her younger sister used to be jealous of her modeling career. \"She's a Leo so she loves attention, and at certain points when we were younger, it bothered her that I was getting attention in terms of my modeling,\" the older Jenner shared with the publication. \"I think that's a natural younger-sister thing - to be jealous. I was jealous of her at times too!\" she admitted. Nevertheless, now that they are growing up and have their own budding careers in showbiz, they become very supportive of each other. \"Now she loves what I do and supports me. She's very into fashion and always texts me when I'm doing a big show like 'That is the sickest thing ever! How were the clothes?' It's as much a part of her as it is mine,\" 19-year-old Kendall told Cosmopolitan . Kendall went on telling the glossy (via PEOPLE) that 18-year-old Kylie was a bit of a \"wild card\" when they were growing up. \"When she was little, she was always crazy, chatty, and all over the place,\" the older Jenner recalled. \"My brother would get a new girlfriend, and she would lock her out of the house in the rain just because she thought it was funny. She's a wild card.\" And Kendall revealed that \"new girlfriend\" happens to be Leah Jenner, who has been married to their half-brother Brandon Jenner for over three years now.
