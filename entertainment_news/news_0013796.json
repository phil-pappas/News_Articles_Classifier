Where do we come from? .... Where are we going?\"\nThe museum has some of the largest collections of prehistoric artefacts in the world, as well as now some newly-acquired ethnological artefacts.\nOn display is a vast array of items including the skulls of a Cro-Magnon, the first early modern human, and of French philosopher and mathematician Rene Descartes, along with a gallery of 19th century busts representing human diversity.\nThe impact humans have had on their environment is shown with examples such as a large Senegalese bus, a Mongolian hut and modern handmade objects.\n\"What we would like visitors to come away with ... is that the big questions faced by our society currently about man's adaptation to himself are in the end questions that mankind has faced for 10,000 years,\" deputy curator Jean Pierre Vigne said.\nThe museum opens to the public on Saturday, with free entry for the first three days.
