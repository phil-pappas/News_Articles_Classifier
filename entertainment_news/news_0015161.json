The song is high on energy and punch with heavy guitar and dubstep sounds that creates a fresh sound. But the effects on the voice spoil a bit of the raw vibe of the song. The next song Hey Akhil sung by Rahul Pandey and Anup Rubens himself carries on the energy from the first track. The song features a catchy chorus. This is followed by Zara Zara Navvaradhe sung by Mohit Chauhan and Srikar is a groovy song, and Mohit's voice perfectly complements the theme of the song with a chorus that is sure to be a hit with audiences. Akkineni Akkineni sung by Divya Kumar, Bhargavi, Uma Neha and Mohana has a bit of a mass tinge to it with a modern twist courtesy fresh synthesiser sounds. The lyrics for this song deserve a special mention. Padessavae sung by Karthik and M.M. Manasi is a bit of a miss as the lyrics fail to inspire. The album keeps things simple with a tried and tested formula.\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-01T22:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:44:44.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
