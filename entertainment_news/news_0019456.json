The frontman sent a cease-and-desist letter to Trump on Saturday -- his second since August -- after the GOP presidential hopeful played the power ballad again at a campaign stop in Georgia, according to TMZ , which obtained the letter. \"Trump for President does not have our client's permission to use 'Dream On' or any of our client's other music in connection with the Campaign because it gives the false impression that he is connected with or endorses Mr. Trump's presidential bid,\" the letter reads. Trump had 24 hours to stop using the song or prove that he has licensed it, or else Tyler will pursue legal action. How to run for president, according to Donald Trump Tyler's attorney, Dina LaPolt, says the issue is purely of copyright and intellectual property, pointing out that Tyler is a registered Republican. (He and Aerosmith drummer Joey Kramer attended the first GOP debate in August as Trump's guests.) \"This is not a political nor personal issue with Mr. Trump, Steven works tirelessly with both Republicans and Democrats regarding copyright reform and his position has always been consistent regarding copyright and intellectual property,\" LaPolt said in a statement. \"Simply, one must get permission from the music creators. Steven wrote 100% of 'Dream On,' and this is about the un-authorized use of his property.\" Tyler is just the latest musician to ask Trump to stop using their tunes. Neil Young, a Bernie Sanders supporter, said the real estate mogul was not authorized to use \"Rockin' in the Free World\" in June. Last month, R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe told Trump's team to \" go f--- yourselves \" after he used \"It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine).\" Other Links From TVGuide.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T21:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:01:24.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
