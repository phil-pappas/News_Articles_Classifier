Four more books followed.\n\"Back around 2009, my agent suggested I write something that women would like because women buy the most books,\" Benson said. \"Super hero movies were becoming popular then, so I thought that wasn't a bad idea to put the two together.\"\nHe merged the crime-fighting heroine with the Alzheimer's story, based on his experience with his mother-in-law, who died of the disease.\nBenson, 60, has written six authorized James Bond novels, three 007 novelizations, plus teaches film classes as an adjunct instructor at the College of DuPage.\nFor nine years, Benson has partnered with Daily Herald film critic Dann Gire to present the Northwest suburban library lecture series \"Dann & Raymond's Movie Club.\"\n\"Black Stiletto\" marks his first literary work to be put in development by a network.\n\"There are still a lot of hurdles to jump before this becomes an actual series,\" Benson said. \"Only a tiny number of projects actually make in to production. This is the first big step after a lot of baby steps. I'm very thrilled.\"\nGo to www.theblackstiletto.net for more information.\nGet great articles like this sent to your inbox!
