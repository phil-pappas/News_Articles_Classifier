Please contact Catrine McGregor to schedule an interview, or to request any additional information or support materials.\nBOOK SUMMARY: Enjoy a voyeuristic glance into what lies beneath the manicured lawns and picturesque families of Cedar Hill , an upper-middle class community with an abundance of unseemly stories.\nFrom one man's attempt to cope after a devastating diagnosis to a neighborhood kidnapping that continues to mystify years later, On Cedar Hill proves things are not always as they appear. Each vignette stands on its own, yet intertwines to form a composite of Cedar Hill and the peculiar lives of those who have lived there over several decades.\nRich in character, place, and its examination of the impact of time, On Cedar Hill will appeal to any reader who has been curious about what may lie behind the mask of propriety of the well-respected, affluent family. A journey to Cedar Hill will quench not only a thirst for scandal, but touch us as we see the characters trying to save not just their image, but their families and lives.\nAUTHOR BIO: Kresl moved to Austin, Texas several years ago to see what all the fuss was about. There, he found laughter, story-telling, and the best swimming water he had ever seen. He also got to work with some of the best storytellers around, found the love of his life, and helped bring into this world a human of astonishing beauty, wisdom, and good humor.\nEmil Kresl was born and raised in Minneapolis, MN , before going off to college in Madison, WI. In Madison , he learned how to write fiction and plays.\nTo put food on the table, Emil helps people find happiness and fulfillment by contributing in a meaningful way to the world around them.\nBOOK INFO :\nON CEDAR HILL\nAuthor: Emil Kresl\nGenre:\nLiterary Fiction\nPaperback\n978-0692487129\n$11.00\neBook\n978-0692501481\n$4.99\nAvailability:\nAmazon\nBarnes & Noble\nKobo Books\niBooks\nContact:\nCatrine McGregor\nP.O.
