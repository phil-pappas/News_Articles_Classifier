The family of Munirathinam, working as a domestic help in Saudi Arabia, has alleged that her right hand was chopped off by her employer when she tried to escape harassment and torture. ”This is a very unfortunate and most condemnable incident. ”Our Embassy officials in Riyadh have already taken up the matter with the Saudi Foreign Office on October 7 and are actively pursuing the matter. We have asked for strict action in the matter and severe punishment for the sponsor. “We have also sought an independent probe in the incident and urged that a case of attempted murder be lodged against the sponsor so that he is punished, if found guilty as per law,” the Spokesperson in the MEA said. Munirathinam is currently being looked after in a Saudi hospital and is stable, he said, adding India has asked the Saudi authorities to direct the sponsor to bear the cost of her treatment. The mission officials have also demanded that Munirathinam’s statement be recorded without any further delay. \nModified Date: October 9, 2015 8:17 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:17:40.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
