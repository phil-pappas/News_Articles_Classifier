It has yet to be confirmed whether it will be broadcast live on TV.Not only that, but he will team up with his former boss Sir Alex Ferguson as manager of the GB side. The Rest of the World team will be captained by France great Zinedine Zidane, while Carlo Ancelotti will coach them.Speaking to BBC Radio 1's Nick Grimshaw this morning, he said: \"I never thought I'd be getting my boots out and playing, but we've come together with UNICEF and we've decided to raise funds by doing a game.\"It's amazing, I'm very proud to have been an ambassador for UNICEF. 2014 was one of the worst years for violence against children and we're trying to help them, and this is a way of doing it, and football is a powerful tool.\" © Getty Images / Gary M. Prior Becks said that he still considers Fergie a \"father figure\", despite the famous incident in which his manager accidentally kicked a boot at his face.Joking about the incident, he said: \"Maybe we can recreate that on the day! If he tried that again a million times, it wouldn't happen.\"He also said that he still feels like a naughty youth player when meeting up with Ferguson: \"When we were at Manchester United, we never thought about having a wine or a beer in front of him. © PA Images / Thibault Camus \"I'm 40 now, and when I met up with him the other day he walked into the room and I stood there drinking a glass of wine with it hidden behind my back!\"The event will be separate to the biannual charity football match Soccer Aid, which was created by Robbie Williams and also raises money for UNICEF.Beckham retired from professional football in 2012, having played for Manchester United, Real Madrid, Los Angeles Galaxy, AC Milan and Paris St Germain. He also won 115 caps for England and remains the country's most-capped outfield player.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:42:33.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
