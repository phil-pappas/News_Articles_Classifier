He eventually pleaded guilty to stalking and was sentenced to 30 months in prison.\nAndrews claims that Marriott is ultimately in the wrong because its employees were the ones who told Barrett she had been staying at the hotel, gave him her room number — and then agreed to place the perv in the room next door.\nSince a trial date was set for late-February, defense lawyers last month sought a court order directing Andrews to provide a specific damages amount.\nMore on this...
