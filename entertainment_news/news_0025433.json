A growing concern among many people across the country, student loan debt is causing much heartache and pain for debtors, friends, relatives, and debt lenders alike. Currently, 40 million American have student loans, totaling in about $1.2 trillion dollars in student loan debt. Many American’s including Kim Kotary, whom was featured in the Forbes article , in efforts of trying to relieve themselves from this surmounting debt, have turned to various bogus agencies advertising promises of helping these people get out of debt. Out of desperation, many people including Kotary are being scammed, signing various agreements and/or contracts with these companies promising to pay an x amount of dollars a month in return for help towards reducing and paying off their debt. However, unknown to victims, there are programs and incentives offered by the government to help student loan debtors get out of debt without having to dish out hundreds and thousands of additional dollars in fees, on top of their original debt amount just to pay off their student loan debt.\nBroadsword Student Advantage is one of the soliciting companies advertising quick and easy ways to get out of debt. These companies promote their services through a variety of different outlets. These outlets include direct mail, radio, cable television, and the most frequently used, online media sources. Be aware.\nSeveral lawsuits have been filed against these soliciting companies. Illinois Attorney General filed a lawsuit against Broadsword for fraud and with using Affordable Life Plans, a Securities & Exchange Commission-registered investment advisor, to charge fees that were against Illinois state law. Minnesota’s Attorney General filed a lawsuit against Student Aid Center for placing debtors in worse situations than they were in before eliciting their services.\nThe main or primary reason for this over serge of fraudulent marketing and advertising companies claiming being able to assist students with loan debt relief is because of the high numbers of persons with student loans needing assistance with paying them off. This high number has created the ideal environment for companies to swindle customers out of their money. The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) estimates that 8 million borrowers are already in default. This is in addition to the 2.5 million borrowers in delinquent status, 6.1 million granted temporary forbearance, and 9.7 million of whom have not begun repayment because of a classified in-school status.\nThe debt relief scammers are more than likely preying on individuals because little information is provided by the Department of Education helping debtors find probable solutions to their debt problems. In efforts to lure as many student loan debtors as possible, companies often employ sales people instead of certified counselors who would be more trained to provide optimal solutions for debtors. “My main problem with student debt relief if that it is a scam,” says Andrew Weber, a certified debt counselor certified by the National Association of Certified Credit Counselors.\nEven without direct regulation however, a variety of federal and state consumer protection laws should prevent the most predatory practices. These regulations include not allowing charges of fees prior to services being rendered, and prohibiting the charge of monthly fees. Thus far, enforcers have only sued to student debt relief companies, however, not considered in significant amounts by many. Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan has request of Secretary of Education Arne Duncan to not make this a litigation process, however, to also enforce rules and regulations requiring a certification process, ensuring only certified counselors are assisting students with their loan debt.\nIt is important that information is available to student loan debtors on what options are available and how they may utilize those options. The related Forbes magazine article, Debt and Deceit , featured in the August 17 2015 issue lists five smart steps to follow when seeking assistance on how to manage and take care of student loan debt. Under Secretary of Education Ted Mitchell, the overseer of student aid, recently informed Forbes that his department is working on concrete probable solutions to help in student loan relief efforts. One must be careful not to fall victim to various for profit companies soliciting their services for a fee to help relieve them of student loan debt when they could find the same services provided by the federal government free of charge.\nRecently, politicians have taken a stance on the student loan debt issue this country is facing. Hillary Clinton, democratic presidential nominee and hopeful, recently in a speech in New Hampshire mentioned her new College Compact , a compact geared towards assisting students with finding ways to get out of student loan debt, reducing overall student loan debt amounts, eliciting more help from the state and federal governments with college affordability and debt relief, and making college more affordable. An important issue to many across the board, student loan debt will be a well discussed topic in the future.", "external_links": ["http://www.forbes.com/forbes/", "https://www.hillaryclinton.com/p/briefing/factsheets/2015/08/10/college-compact/", "http://www2.ed.gov/fund/grants-college.html"], "published": "2015-10-18T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:25:37.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
