(RICK DIAMOND / GETTY IMAGES) John J. Moser Contact Reporter Top country artist Jason Aldean coming to Allentown's PPL Center \nJason Aldean, who is the top-selling digital country male artist of all time and drew Allentown Fair’s biggest crowd in the past 20 years, will perform at the city’s PPL Center this spring, it was just announced. \nAldean, whose last three albums have topped the country charts and sold multi-platinum, will play the arena at 8 p.m. May 6. \nThe announcement marks a powerful one-two punch of announcements today for the arena. Earlier today, it announced a Feb. 17 concert by classic rockers Def Leppard, with Styx and Tesla. \nTicket prices and on-sale times for Aldean have not been announced. Tickets for PPL Center typically are sold at www.PPLCenter.com , the arena box office at 701 Hamilton St., or at 610-610-347-TIXX. \nOpening the show will be Thomas Rhett, who had a 2013 debut album that produced three No. 1 songs, was nominated for New Artist of the Year by both the Country Music Association and Academy of Country Music, and A Thousand Horses, which topped country charts with its song “Smoke” this summer. \nThe Recording Industry Association of America says Aldean has sold more music digitally than any other male country artist. In all, Aldean has sold 10 million copies of his six studio albums, with four of them hitting No. 1. He also has produced more than 20 gold and platinum singles, 14 of which have hit No. 1. \nAldean in 2012 shattered Allentown Fair’s record for box office gate receipts, pulling in $858,391 by selling out 14,549 tickets. That also was the most people at a fair concert since it capped capacity after Boyz II Men drew 14,604 in 1995. \nHe’s perhaps best known for the singles “Dirt Road Anthem,” which sold quadruple platinum in 2011; \"Don't You Wanna Stay\" (with Kelly Clarkson), who sold double platinum in 2010; and “My Kinda Party,” the title track from his 2010 triple-platinum, No. 1 album. That is Aldean’s best-selling disc. \nAldean’s latest disc is “Old Boots, New Dirt,” released in October 2014. It also has topped the charts and gone platinum, and produced three No. 1 hits: the platinum \"Burnin' It Down,\" “Old Boots, New Dirt” and \"Tonight Looks Good on You.\" \nThe disc won the Billboard Music Awards’ Top Country Album and “Burnin’ It Down” won Top Country Song. \n\"My Kinda Party\" won 2011's Album of the Year from the Country Music Association and the Country Music Awards, and \"Don't Wanna Stay\" won the Academy of Country Music's Single of the Year and Vocal Event of the Year, and the American Country Awards' Single of the Year. \nAldean, 38, also won the Academy of Country Music's Top New Male Vocalist in 2005 and Male Vocalist of the Year in 2013 and this year. He’s been nominated for three Grammy Awards. \nHe opened a show with Miranda Lambert and Dierks Bently at Allentown Fair in 2006. \nRhett’s self-titled debut album peaked at No. 2, and crossed over to the Top 10 on the overall Albums chart. It produced the No. 1 hits \"It Goes Like This,\" which was double-platinum; “Get Me Some of That,\" which went platinum; and Make Me Wanna,\" which went gold. \nHe was nominated for New Artist of the Year by both the Country Music Association and Academy of Country Music. \nRhett’s sophomore disc, “Tangled Up,” released Sept. 25, is at No. 3 on the country charts and had the No. 1 platinum hit “Crash and Burn.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:17:57.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
