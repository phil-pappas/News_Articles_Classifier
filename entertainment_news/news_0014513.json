Published by New York City-based Page Publishing, Robin Holstein’s poignant tale details the main character’s life lead by faith and how God answers all prayers. In Part 1 of the “Faith Journey Series: Not By Might”, God shows up in powerful ways to reveal His sovereignty and sufficiency to a little country girl from the small town of Lithia Springs in the southern state of Georgia.\nRobin grew up in a sheltered Christian home where nothing bad could ever happen, it seemed, and life was full of surprises as God showed up powerfully one miracle at a time. Her life was full of supernatural wonders, fun adventures, and romance as she spent her childhood witnessing incredible miracles that could only occur by the hand of the Creator.\nHer young adult life in college consisted of riding bulls, pulling off elaborate pranks with her friends, and meeting the man she thought she had always dreamed of. This book is filled with amazing miraculous events, humor, adventure, and romance. Life was nothing short of her perfect idea of a fairy tale until one devastating diagnosis threatened to shatter her dreams, shake her faith and take her life.\nReaders who wish to experience this inspiring work can purchase “The Faith Journey Series: Not By Might” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708.\nAbout Page Publishing\nPage Publishing is a traditional New York based full-service publishing house that handles all of the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
