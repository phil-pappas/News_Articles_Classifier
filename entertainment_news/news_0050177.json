News that the romance between the pair - who first met at the Teen Choice Awards - is \"new\" and not yet serious. \nScott, 29, previously admitted he would give up his career for love - if he knew the woman in question was 'The One' \nAsked if he'd give up acting for the love of his life, he said: \"Yes I would. I think that's the ultimate sacrifice and if I couldn't see my life without her then of course. She would have to be 'The One' though.\" \nScott's father is 'American Sniper' director Clint Eastwood and he admits the Hollywood legend used to try and set him up on dates when he was younger. \nAsked if Clint ever set him up, he said: \"Yes! When I was 16 he was rooting for me and this older girl. He wanted me to make it happen and it did. He was so happy. \n\"Would I trust him to pick me a girl? Yes sure. I absolutely would.\" \nThe 'Suicide Squad' actor falls in love easily, but tries to bear in mind some advice he was given by his mother, Jacelyn Reeves. \nHe explained: \"I've been the guy who falls immediately but my mom always told me to, 'Give it all seasons'. If you give it a year then you'll know if it's right.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:53:09.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
