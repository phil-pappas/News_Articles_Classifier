These weekly conversations are part of his mission to change how banks interact with their communities via powerful, dynamic social media strategies. \"Bank On It\" episodes are free on iTunes and Stitcher . The extraordinary response to the podcast is creating the perfect lead-in to next April's #BankSocial Media Conference .\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151005/274257LOGO\n\"Success is a process and a journey, not a destination,\" remarks Siracusa. \"I'm thrilled and grateful that so many truly astonishing people have decided to join me on this journey. The response to Bank On It and #BankSocial is proof that there are great people out there doing great things in their communities. Together, we can build on that momentum and effect real change in the banking industry.\"\nRecent guests of \"Bank On It\" include Mickie Kennedy , founder of eReleases.com; Jeffry Pilcher from The Financial Brand; John Yembrick and Jason Townsend from NASA; Lee Odden , CEO of TopRank Online Marketing; John McWeeney, Jr. , President and CEO of the New Jersey Bankers Association; Scott Monty, PR consultant and founder of Scott Monty Strategies, LLC; and Ann Chen from Citizens Bank of Edmonds, Oklahoma . In short, each week's guest brings a unique perspective on the challenges of marketing in the social media age, all within the context of retail banks and credit unions.\nThe list of upcoming guest reinforces the notion that, for anyone in the business of banking marketing, \"Bank On It\" is worth making time for. Perhaps chief on that list is Joe Pulizzi , the award-winning founder and CEO of Content Marketing Institute – a standard-bearer in content marketing news, education and training. Other future guests include:\nMary Wisniewski , Tech Reporter at American Banker Siya Vansia, ConnectOne Bank Mark Traphagen , Stone Temple Consultants Peter Shankman , Co-founder of Shankman Honig Andrew Davis , Bestselling Author and Keynote Speaker at #BankSocial Marty Weintraub , Founder @aimclear Joe Sullivan , CEO Market Insights Public trust in the banking industry took a hit in the wake of the financial crisis. Rebuilding that trust, according to Siracusa, must happen at the level of human interaction. Smaller retail banks and credit unions, however, are somewhat behind the curve in terms of brand marketing. Siracusa's proposition is that these organizations are home to some of the most caring and dedicated people in the industry, but they need a little help building and communicating their brand.\nThe #BankSocial Media Conference is scheduled for April 7-8 in Newark . The first and only event of its kind, conference registration is still open. Siracusa envisions this in-person gathering of talented, passionate marketing experts as the beginning of a renaissance in how people relate to local retail banks and credit unions. A percentage of the proceeds from #BankSocial will to Special Olympics New Jersey , an organization near and dear to Siracusa.\nAbout #BankSocial\n#BankSocial is more than a conference: It's a movement. #BankSocial will launch the retail banking industry into the future by teaching banks and credit unions of all sizes nationwide how to use social media to communicate powerfully, effectively and authentically. Registration is open now for the April 2016 #BankSocial event.
