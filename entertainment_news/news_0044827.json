LOUIS , Oct. 26, Addicted is presently located in St Louis, Mo. They currently just finished a radio campaign with Skateboard Marketing Productions in New York , headed up by Munsey Ricci . The spins that they are receiving are helping them climb the hard rock charts. They are indie musicians presently looking for a label. They are also on many Internet radio stations. Although this is their first CD together as a band, they are writing the music for their next release, which will be composed of heavier integrated music. Now that the radio campaign is finished, they are looking to tour. The band's number one goal is to reach their fans with the music and live performance, which has been stated by all the fans and the venues owners to be more exciting than their recorded music. Greg Smith feels very fortunate to have joined with the musical talents of guitarist Rick Tschee, bassist Joe Duggan and drummer Sabastian Neudeck .\nAddicted is bringing back the original nonstop drive and continual changes from song to song that we have all admired and enjoyed throughout the years by rock performers. Their musical influences stem from artists like Ozzy, Alice In Chains, Shinedown, Disturbed, Guns N' Roses, Breaking Benjamin, Chevelle, Metal Church, and more. Fans of all ages and genre backgrounds have left their shows with memorabilia and stated that they cannot wait see them again. \"We wanted to create a sound that after listening to, left people wanting more,\" said Greg.\nThis month the band just finished their self-titled track video \"Addiction.\" The video touches boundaries of addictions that so many people face today. In lieu of these times and troubles the band urges people to strive for new addictions such as health, prosperity and music.
