So did Mia Couto, a prominent Mozambican author who described how his friend \"divided his life\" between Sweden and Mozambique.\nCouto said Mankell was more than a writer, not just collecting stories on travels around Mozambique but also getting involved, helping to build a village for orphaned children in Chimoio, a provincial capital.\n\"He was participating in the process,\" Couto said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press.\nMozambique's war against Portuguese colonizers ended with independence in 1975, but civil war followed until a peace deal in 1992. Today, the economy is growing fast, although Mozambique remains very poor.\nMankell first went to Africa in 1973 and settled part-time in Mozambique in the 1980s. Some of his novels, including \"Chronicler of the Winds,\" are based in Africa.\nIrina Schoulgin Nyoni, Sweden's ambassador to Mozambique, said the theater memorial was moving.\n\"I think his personal engagement was something that made him very special here,\" she said.\nHumanities Henning Mankell Mozambique", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:06:15.651+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
