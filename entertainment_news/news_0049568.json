It's a verdant field. #verdant— Patrick Ness (@Patrick_Ness) October 2, 2015That's that cleared up then, but since Class is set in Coal Hill School - where current Doctor Who companion Clara Oswald works as a teacher - could Jenna Coleman be leaving the parent series to star in the spinoff?Not according to Ness, who also clarified broadcast plans for the series - suggesting that the new series will debut on BBC Three online and get a repeat airing on BBC One.Btw, plan is, \"Class\" airs on BBC3 online, then on BBC1, at which point the new episode of \"Class\" hits BBC3. It's cool.— Patrick Ness (@Patrick_Ness) October 2, 2015Class - an eight-part series - will start filming in early 2016 and air later in the year.Doctor Who's head writer Steven Moffat and executive producer Brian Minchin will work with Ness on the project.Doctor Who in crisis?
