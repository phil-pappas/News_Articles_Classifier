Make sure you check out “Charmaine Wheatley: Souvenirs” while you’re there. There will be events in the courtyard from 11 a.m. until 4:30 p.m.\nAnd the Museum of Fine Arts is also gratis on Columbus Day from 10 a.m. to 4:45 p.m. Featured is Sonya Clark’s performance art: “Hairdressers Are my Heroes,” with Boston stylist Kathy Montrevil, who will arrange Clark’s hair into an African hairstyle based on a sculpture in the collection — part of the installation “Crafted: Objects in Flux.” The museum’s open house includes art-making activities for families and tours; admission to all exhibitions, including “Class Distinctions: Dutch Painting in the Age of Rembrandt and Vermeer,” is free. See a video on bostonherald.com.\nOut and about, the Lindy Bomb Squad dance troupe performs in the Christian Science Plaza area, there’s a kids parade with the Hot Tamale Brass Band, a chance to check out Fenway Open Studios, backstage tours of Wheelock Family Theatre and much, much more.
