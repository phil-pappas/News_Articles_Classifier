These deals were inked just in time for the Frankfurt Book Fair, where Booktrack's CEO Paul Cameron will be speaking on the panel for the \"Hug the Alien\" session on October 16 at Frankfurt's Business Club and VP of Publishing Cameron Drew will be participating on the \"International Self-Publishing and Author Program\" session on Saturday, October 17 .\n\"We're thrilled to announce Booktrack's strong momentum in securing relationships with key publishers,\" said Paul Cameron, CEO and Co-founder, Booktrack. \"We believe the future of reading will involve people reading on tablets or mobile devices with a contextual and synchronized soundtrack played in harmony with the story delivered, in the same way film was forever changed with the addition of sound. Previously, the reading experience was the only mainstream entertainment medium that lacked synchronized sound, that all changed when we invented the new category of Soundtracks for Books. Book publishers appreciate that our platform is the only reading enhancement delivered while you read. We don't interrupt the reading process, but rather enhance the experience while keeping users engaged. Booktrack is uniquely positioned to help publishers and authors re-invigorate sales of backlist titles by re-issuing them in a new compelling way.\"\nSynonymous for independent vision, Sourcebooks joins the Booktrack platform with five best-selling titles that span different genres, including Wattpad sensation Ali Novak's My Life with the Walter Boys and Greer McAllister's The Magician's Lie .
