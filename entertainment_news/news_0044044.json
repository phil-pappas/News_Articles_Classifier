Markosian [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons The Chernobyl nuclear power station was the site of a horrific disaster more than 26 years ago. Despite the contaminated plant life, vegetation and trees, the area is showing promise with a significant increase in the wildlife population. However, it is important to determine what type of impact the disaster had on these animals, along with addressing rumors that the radiation exposure would cause serious mutations.\nThe Chernobyl Disaster\nThe Ukraine experienced a tragedy in April of 1986 when the nuclear power station was destroyed. The aftermath of the fire and accident caused major amounts of radioactive materials to be released into the environment. While the cloud affected most of Europe, it was the Ukraine that became exposed to the majority of these harmful materials. At the time, two workers died as a direct result of the explosion, and another 31 perished later as a result of being exposed to poison from the radiation.\nThere were also long-lasting effects of radiation emitted from the accident that led to another 50,000 deaths. Chernobyl and Pripyat were closed off after the disaster, and authorities permanently evacuated approximately 115,000 individuals from the areas that were the most contaminated. Another 220,000 people were moved in the years following the incident.\nSadly, most of the animals near Chernobyl died from radiation poisoning, and nearby pine forests also turned red from the exposure. While some thought that the exposed locations may never come back, they are actually rapidly returning to what they once were: Rampant forests with marsh-like areas.\nWhat Happens without the Presence of the Human Population?\nThe land surrounding Chernobyl had a difficult past that extends well beyond the power plant accident. In addition to numerous wars that were fought in the region, the marshes had been drained and turned to animal-barren farms. Through all of this, some animals still managed to survive the destruction, chaos and radioactive materials that had marred their land. Interestingly, with the absence of mankind in the area for almost 30 years, the disaster location has transitioned into a sanctuary for wildlife.\nActual Damage to Chernobyl Under Debate\nThere is still an ongoing debate in regards to the damage the explosion caused to the environment. Following the Chernobyl incident, studies showed that the overall health and wellness of the animals living nearby was affected, and this included reproductive issues. Birds and mammals were especially sensitive to the materials leaked, and most of them perished due to acute radiation syndrome.\nWhile the early devastation killed much of the plant and animal life, the shelf life of the radioactive isotypes were short and disappeared only a few weeks after the disaster. In fact, only one percent of radioactive materials were found in the immediate vicinity a year after the accident. Researchers and scientists also thought the impact would be long-lasting in regards to the wildlife population.\nA paper from Current Biology disproved this theory by indicating that many of the mammals have bounced back to even greater numbers than before the Chernobyl accident. At least one member of the research team, Jim Smith, went so far as to tell Science Magazine that the recently published research proves that sharing an environment with humans is actually more damaging to wildlife than living through a disaster such as the Chernobyl explosion.\nAnimals in Even Greater Numbers\nIn addition to humans being removed from the area that was damaged by the accident, hunting was also considered unsafe because deer were found to have dangerously high levels of radiation in the immediate aftermath. However, within a decade , hundreds of bird species, beaver, fox, roe deer, bear, moose, feral pigs and lynx populations have bounced back and thrived in areas abandoned by humans after the tragedy. There have also been confirmed reports of wolves roaming the lands. It’s currently estimated that there are 120 wolves freely navigating the exclusion zone.\nSome researchers say that the larger animals such as wolves are not as affected by the disaster as the smaller ones because they weed their species of the weak and mutated. Another surprise in seeing this surge in wildlife is that many appear to be normal. Of course, a large percentage of the smaller animals get eaten by their prey before researchers and scientists have a chance to study them. This leaves only the fittest being able to roam the earth and survive.\nNot All Good News\nThe rising animal population within a land that has experienced such utter devastation is excellent news for many. However, the news isn’t as happy for all animals in the region. Some species, just like the humans, left the 1,600 square miles around Chernobyl after the accident, including swallows, pigeons and white storks. Amphibians and reptiles were the hardest hit with a massive decline in numbers and noticeable mutations left behind on those that survived. Horses have also noticeably declined. Since the wolves’ numbers are up, the beaver population is now dwindling, a result of being a major food source for the wolves.\nThere are also biologists who are challenging the views of the positives findings. Two biologists from the University of Paris and South Carolina have published findings that support the decline of mammals, insects and birds in the contaminated regions of Chernobyl. They also found that most of bird species appear to be avoiding building nests in the areas that have experienced a high level of radioactive devastation. It is important to note, however, that other researchers have pointed out that there are many flaws within this particular study.\nWe don't need to be told that radiation is not good for animals and the environment. However, the main lesson of Chernobyl appears to be that when humans are removed from the equation, nature has a way of fighting back and flourishing. Regardless of which side of the debate is right, it is indisputable that at least some forms of wildlife are thriving within the exclusion zone.", "external_links": ["http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/01/14/chernobyl.nature.radiation.debate/", "http://www.thewildlifenews.com/2012/12/31/chernobyl-wildlife/", "http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(15)00988-4", "http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/nuclear_power/2013/01/wildlife_in_chernobyl_debate_over_mutations_and_populations_of_plants_and.2.html", "http://news.sciencemag.org/biology/2015/10/humans-are-worse-radiation-chernobyl-animals-study-finds", "http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html?dom=prime&src=syn"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:41:46.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
