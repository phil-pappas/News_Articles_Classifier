(Cindy Yamanaka/AP) \nOfficials said Caitlyn was towing an off-road vehicle on a trailer behind a Cadillac Escalade on February 7 when she crashed into two cars, pushing one into oncoming traffic. Driver Kim Howe was killed when her Lexus was hit by a Hummer. \n“We believed from the start that a thorough and objective investigation would clear Caitlyn of any criminal wrongdoing,” said Blair Berk, Caitlyn’s lawyer. \n“We are heartened the district attorney has agreed that even a misdemeanour charge would be inappropriate. A traffic accident, however devastating and heartbreaking when a life is lost, is not necessarily a criminal matter.” \nThe accident occurred before Caitlyn announced she is transgender and transitioned into her new identity. (Chris Pizzello/AP) \nSheriff’s investigators previously determined that Caitlyn was travelling at an unsafe speed for the road conditions and there was enough evidence to support a vehicular manslaughter charge. The case was then referred to the district attorney’s major crimes division. \nAfter the accident, she released a statement expressing sympathy to everyone involved in the accident. \n“It is a devastating tragedy,” the statement read. “I cannot pretend to imagine what this family is going through at this time. I am praying for them.” Share article \nCaitlyn is facing separate lawsuits by Ms Howe’s stepchildren and the driver of the other car involved in the collision.
