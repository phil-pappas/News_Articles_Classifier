For instance, he was once a 6ft 4in tall professional basketball player, until a tree fell on him. But, of course, change is an inescapable part of the human condition. Why? Is that fair? Some changes are good, some bad. Why can they not be more clearly labelled? How did we end up working longer hours? Where did all the sparrows go? If you are feeling flustered because of flux, Andy will teach you to cope with the changes we have seen and the changes to come. \nAndy is co-creator / writer of Outnumbered (BBC1), What We Did On Our Holiday (BBC Films), Ballot Monkeys (Channel 4) and Drop The Dead Donkey (Channel 4), star of Old Harry’s Game (Radio 4) and regular guest on The News Quiz, I’m Sorry I Haven’t A Clue, Have I Got News For You, QI and numerous other TV and radio credits. Share article \nHe appears at Theatre Royal Winchester on November 6. \nTickets: 01962 840440 or visit theatreroyalwinchester.co.uk .
