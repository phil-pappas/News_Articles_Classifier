He manages to investigate the origins of three characteristic Moroccan dishes as well as give us a potted tour of the eastern part of the country. He also gets to hang with the intriguing Karen Hadfield, a Melburnian who first visited on holiday five years previously and never quite got around to leaving. The show has a filmic quality about it, taking full advantage of the extraordinary colours and sights of Morocco. And through it all bounces Delia with his trademark grinning enthusiasm. He also brings an ockerish edge to his delivery, such as the moment when he saddles up on a camel and confesses he prefers \"1000cc between my legs\". Delia is clearly not lacking in culinary confidence, happily checking out local delicacies and then announcing what he would do to improve them for his own customers in Melbourne.  \nItaly Unpacked, SBS, 8.30pm \nAdvertisement Art historian Andrew Graham-Dixon and chef Giorgio Locatelli return with their cultural double act, attempting to get to the heart of Italy via its cuisine, art and history. They make a great pairing, with Graham-Dixon’s posh pomminess making the perfect foil for Locatelli’s engaging enthusiasm expressed in an accent so rich it could be sliced and diced in one of his own kitchens. In this second series they travel the length of the nation’s west coast in a combined travelogue/art history lesson/food journey that makes for glorious armchair tourism. In particular, a visit to the Cinque Terre has just made it to the top of my bucket list.\nPlease Like Me, ABC, 9.30pm \nThis is the third series for the massively well received Please Like Me . It continues to defy categorisation and maybe it’s time simply to give away the desire to stick a label on it and just accept it for the curious hybrid that it is. This episode brings the pain of several of the characters brutally close to the surface. The opening scene in which depressed Hannah (Hannah Gadsby) self-harms is particularly powerful, as is the awful revelation that Mae has for Alan. Threaded through all the chaos is Josh Thomas, who manages (mostly) to tread the fine line between knowing irony and irritating smart-arsery.\nNick Galvin", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:53:03.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
