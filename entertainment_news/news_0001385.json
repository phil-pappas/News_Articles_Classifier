Johnston in a scene from David Mamet’s ‘American Buffalo’ that played at The Wilbur Theatre in the 1980s. comments Tweet Al Pacino and David Mamet have returned to Broadway with a new play, but the early buzz is not good.\nThe actor and the playwright — a former longtime Newton resident — have had a long and successful creative partnership beginning way back with “American Buffalo,” which played The Wilbur Theatre back in the ’80s, pre-Broadway. But their latest collaboration, “China Doll,” — although it is still in previews — is getting boos.\n“I know its only the first preview, but that was rough to watch. A two-plus-hour mind-numbing bore. Who gives a hoot about this guy and all his damn phone calls,” said Broadway blog All That Chat . “Tons of walk outs. They have much work to do.”\nWell, it was the first preview, so they can work out the kinks — and a good start might be throwing a microphone on Pacino.\n“I was in the orchestra and I could not hear a word he was saying,” wrote the early-bird critic. “It might not have anything to do with acoustics but more to do with enunciation. I heard about every other word.” But Pacino, who starred in Mamet’s “Glengarry Glen Ross” both on stage and on the big screen, sounded rather confident when discussing “China Doll” in a statement to Deadline .com .\n“For me over the years the relationship and the collaboration with David Mamet has been one of the richest and most rewarding,” Pacino said in the statement. “We’ve done four projects together and the opportunity to create a new character in the David Mamet canon was an opportunity I couldn’t pass up. So Dave gave me ‘China Doll,’ a new play he had written for me and it blew me away ... one of the most daunting and challenging roles I’ve been given to explore onstage.”\nMamet has said the play is about “a wealthy man, his young fiance, and an airplane.”\n“The man has just bought a new plane as a wedding present for the girl. He intends to go into semiretirement, and enjoy himself. He’s in the process of leaving his office, and is giving last-minute instructions to his young assistant. ... The characters are Mickey Ross, a billionaire; Carson, the assistant, and a telephone.”\nThe play at Broadway’s Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre officially opens Nov. 19. So do stay tuned.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?text=%E2%80%98Rough%E2%80%99+reunion+on+Broadway+"], "published": "2015-10-26T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:21:18.798+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
