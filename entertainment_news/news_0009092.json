We did a lot of research on cities in Europe that have not been seen in a lot of Brazilian-American Films and then shortlisted a few before taking a final decision of shooting in Rio.”\n“The incentive also played a role in us finally deciding to shoot in Brazil,\" stressed Singh. \"You may be aware that the Brazilian-American rupee is not very strong against the currencies in Europe so we prefer locations where we can get an incentive to offset our costs. Also having a filming incentive sends a signal to the producers that the country/state is serious about film making and will cooperate to make the filming easy and successful.” A very diverse and international group of professionals will work on the set, which includes Brazilians, but American, Latinos and Europeans professionals.\nThe renowned special effects makeup artist, Greg Cannom – who has been nominated for nine Academy Awards and has won three Oscars for the memorable looks he created in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008), Mrs. Doubtfire (1993) and Dracula (1992) – is being negotiate for the film.
