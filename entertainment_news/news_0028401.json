(You might remember when Lifetime did similar movies on \"Saved by the Bell\" and \"Full House.\" )\nThough the show lost popularity and pop-culture significance in its later years, it went on for 10 seasons, losing and gaining cast members along the way. \nLet's take a look back at the major players of \"90210,\" then and now in the gallery above.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T18:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:27:52.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
