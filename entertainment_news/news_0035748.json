Photo: Justin McManus \nHOPE FARM\nPeggy Frew\nScribe, $29.99 \nSilver Landes was 13 when the charismatic Miller appeared, captivating her mother Ishtar by unfolding \"the smooth carpet of his voice\", and disrupting their tight unit of two. Miller persuades them to move from Brisbane to country Victoria, with grandiose plans for self-sufficiency – \"All we need is a patch of land and some seeds\". The Hope Farm hippie commune they join, however, is frayed and weedy, filled with a dozen or so crumpled adults, a young child and a baby.\nSilver is wary of her new life and resentful of the honey-tongued interloper forever grabbing Ishtar with the easy entitlement of a toddler claiming his favourite toy. She soon realises Miller's idealism is nothing but a \"human hurricane churning in ineffective circles\", and yet she feels a sense of menace beneath his bluster. Set in the mid-1980s, Hope Farm is Peggy Frew's second novel, and one that consolidates her reputation as a rising talent. Narrated by a much older Silver who casts her mind back to the events at the commune, Frew's depiction of her adolescent protagonist is controlled and masterful. She carefully threads Silver into the heart of her novel, making her confront the \"tensions of the adult world – the fraught and febrile aura that surrounded Ishtar and those in her orbit that whined and creaked like a wire pulled too tight\".    \nHope Farm by Peggy Frew. \nOther characters flit in and around Hope Farm: there's Ian, a year older than Silver and a victim of merciless bullying by the school thugs. (Silver herself is nicknamed \"Hippie Shit\" from \"Dope Farm\".) With his affected speech and old-man sensibilities, Ian's outsider status is just as pronounced as Silver's, their friendship born from the need for mutual support. Silver is also drawn to Dan, whose quiet kindness is the opposite of Miller's showy grandstanding. But most of all she is desperate to connect with her distracted mother, who appears – to her detriment – to be enthralled by the whims of her latest paramour.     \nAdvertisement Interspersed with Silver's story is Ishtar's own tale: her peripatetic, precarious life, moving from one ne'er-do-well bloke to the next, from ashram to commune, eking out an existence in menial jobs and not living up to the fiery potential of her adopted name (\"goddess of the sword, bow and arrows, standing with one foot on the back of a lion\"). In its exploration of maternal, sexual, unrequited and platonic relationships, Hope Farm is a finely calibrated study of love, loss and belonging.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:32:55.946+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
