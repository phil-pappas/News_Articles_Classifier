Check out #Suffragette Meryl Streep and Carey Mulligan talking about feminism @TimeOutLondon http://t.co/4DfMLRiMLL pic.twitter.com/yASP0lUByT — Curzon Cinemas (@CurzonCinemas) September 30, 2015 \nThe T-shirt is part of a promotional campaign for a new film starring Streep alongside Carey Mulligan called \"Suffragette,\" which tells of the women's suffrage movement. However, the phrase on the shirt, which is a quote from the film, has many outraged in belief it unjustly compares the struggle of white women with slavery. \nThe complete quote from the film, which is stated by Emmeline Pankhurst portrayed by Streep in the film, is as follows: \n\"\"Know that women, once convinced that they are doing what is right, that their rebellion is just, will go on, no matter what the difficulties, no matter what the dangers, so long as there is a woman alive to hold up the flag of rebellion. I would rather be a rebel than a slave.\" \nMany critics say the use of the words \"rebel\" and \"slave\" immediately draws thoughts of the Confederacy and the enslavement of black people rather than the plight of white women to vote. In addition, the film's all white cast has also drawn negative attention. \nYou can read some of the reactions to the shirts below. What do you think?

And if not, her publicist should have. — deray mckesson (@deray) October 5, 2015 White women have said a lot of terrible things over the course of history, doesn't mean you wear it on a shirt. https://t.co/Y02pmmnJCL — Jamilah Lemieux (@JamilahLemieux) October 5, 2015 If ur feminism isnt intersectional then ur doing it wrong.
