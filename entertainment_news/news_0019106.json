Travers - over 50 years on. \nAsked who could take on the mantle of stepping into her shoes, Julie said: \"I've got a lot (of theories) actually but I'm not sure which one they'll go for or how they'll shape it. I really don't know. But look, it's 50 years since (the original) came out, so I think it's time.\" \nBut the actress is pleased the plot of the new movie will tell a different story to her film. \nJulie told the 'TODAY' show: \"Well, what I do know about it is it's not the original piece. I think there were seven 'Mary Poppins' books, because that was a series also. I think there were seven left in the Disney archives or vaults, and so those seven books are being developed as a movie.\" \nElsewhere, the 'Sound of Music' actress has released her seventh children's book titled 'The Very Fairy Princess: A Spooky, Sparkly, Halloween' that's inspired by her granddaughter Hope, and Julie has revealed the books are being adapted into an animated TV series. julie andrews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:45:13.563+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
