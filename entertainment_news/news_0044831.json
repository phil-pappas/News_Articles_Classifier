He's from Ensenada, Mexico. \"My art deals a lot with these two identities. I try to use humor when dealing with some of these issues.\" \nHe's gained a lot of exposure recently because of a series of images he made that look at casts from popular television shows if they were played by minorities. And it took one of the subjects of this art to make the concept go viral. \n\"Something folks haven't mentioned is the fact that Wilson Cruz, who played Rickie on My So Called Life, was one of the drawings I made, actually shared that image and engaged in conversations via comments,\" he told La Voz. \nHis art, which appears on his Facebook page carries this message: \"My intention here is to be confrontational and turn popular white characters into POC [people of color] characters.\" \nClick on the link above to check out some of the shows that got the POC treatment from Salgado.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:05:56.812+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
