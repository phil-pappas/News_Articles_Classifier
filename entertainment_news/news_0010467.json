City voters will consider a non-binding referendum on the pool when they cast their ballots in the Nov. 3 municipal election. By KELLY QUIMBY\nAfter more than four years of planning, fundraising and development, the Tybee Island Community Pool Committee is nearly ready to take the plunge.\nTheir work to find a location and develop specifications for a community pool will be presented to the public in two weeks as a one-sentence, non-binding referendum on the ballot for the city’s Nov. 3 general election.\nVoters will be asked: “Should municipal funds be used to construct a public swimming pool on city property?”\nVicki Worden, president of the pool committee, hopes the city’s voters will answer “yes.” But new opposition to the pool referendum has cropped up in recent weeks, and the people leading the opponents want Tybee residents to say “no.”\nFor their part, Worden and the rest of the pool committee are trying to use the time before the election to clear up what they say are misconceptions about the project. The committee has scheduled an open house for the public Friday at the Guard House on Van Horne Street.\nAmong the concerns Worden expects to address are costs for the pool’s construction. While some opponents have suggested the pool could lead to a tax increase, Worden argued the expenses for the pool’s construction could likely be covered by special purpose local-option sales tax dollars set aside for recreation.\nOnce the pool is built, Worden added, she expects money raised by the committee’s fundraisers, along with future membership fees, will cover future operations for the heated, saltwater pool. Unlike the ocean, Worden said, visitors to the pool will be able to swim eight or nine months of the year.\n“Everybody I’ve talked to for the past couple of years has asked when we’re getting a pool,” Worden said. “There’s not going to be a tax increase. The city does have general funds that can be used for construction.\n“Some are concerned with the operating costs,” she added, “but we’ve done a lot of research on how to meet the operating costs by dues, fees.”\nThe committee reports that other concerns about the pool’s effect on Tybee’s Federal Emergency Management Agency’s flood insurance rating are also unfounded. The pool committee’s website indicates the addition of the pool would not cause flood insurance rates to rise.\nThis is true, even when taking into account a recent change to city policy that adjusts the five-year rule on improvements applied to city properties to a one-year rule, a former city planner said.\n“The city has enough points to maintain their current rating even with changes to the (five-year) rule and the potential addition of the pool,” Ed DiTomasso of the Ecological Planning Group wrote in an email last week. “If it was close, the city would not have considered it.”\nWorden said nothing has changed about the proposed design of the pool since it was announced earlier this year.\nThe committee suggests relocating existing volleyball courts in Memorial Park to make room for the pool, which would have the following features:\n• 75-foot swim lanes for laps\n• Two colorful splash areas for kids\n• Water deep enough for deep-water aerobics (about 6 feet deep) and shallow water aerobics (4 to 5 feet deep)\n• Sheltered areas, showers, changing areas and a small office\n• An entry gate near a ticket area that will allow for control over who enters and exits\n• Decor consistent with other city buildings\n• Life guard stations situated for best coverage\n• Security cameras, a 10-foot fence and noise abatement features\nThe pool committee estimates the cost to construct the pool at $750,000\nOpponents, however, say that money could be better spent to improve recreation facilities that already exist.\n“I appreciate the people wanting something for the kids and something for their own personal health, but (a pool)’s not what we need,” said Jack Boylston, one of the founders of the “No Pool on Tybee” group, which began collecting money and putting out signs about two weeks ago. “There’s so many better uses for the money. You don’t come to Tybee to go to a swimming pool.”\nJohn Branigin, who with Boylston started the “No Pool” sign campaign, said he has his doubts about the pool’s future self-sustainability. Based on the interest in the opposing signs, he added, many other island residents have similar views.\n“While I believe the committee has done a thorough job, I don’t believe the pool will be able to sustain itself on operating expenses. I think they’re vastly overestimating the people coming here to rent on Tybee,” Branigin said. “They’re coming here to go to the beach. They’re not coming here to go to a public pool.”\nIn addition to the non-binding referendum, voters participating in Tybee’s Nov. 3 municipal election will also consider six candidates for City Council: John Bremer, Barry Brown, Wanda Doyle, Stephen Friedman, Julie Livingston and Paul Wolff. Mayor Jason Buelterman is running unopposed.\nIF YOU GO\nWhat: Tybee Pool Open House\nWhen: 5:30-8:30 p.m. Friday\nWhere: Tybee Island Guard House, Van Horne Street", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14814724.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14814724.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T19:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T06:44:57.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
