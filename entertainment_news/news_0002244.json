Sister Bliss and Maxi Jazz of Faithless (Ian West/PA) \nMember Sister Bliss said: “”How exciting! It’s amazing, especially after all this time. The last time we had a number one album I spent the evening mopping the floor after having a particularly raucous house party. It’s incredible that people have taken Faithless to their hearts and stuck with us over the last 20 years.” \nFaithless 2.0 is a retrospective of their 20-year career, with remixed tracks by names like Avicii, Armin Van Buuren and Tiesto. \nThe dance trio, consisting of Bliss, Maxi Jazz and Rollo, had their first number one with No Roots in 2004, followed by Forever Faithless – The Greatest Hits the next year. Maxi Jazz performs on the pyramid stage at Glastonbury 2010 (Ben Birchall/PA) \nThey scored 17 top 40 singles before they split in 2011, although they reunited for a 20th anniversary gig in February. \nJess Glynne’s former chart-topper I Cry When I Laugh held firm at number three this week, followed by US rapper The Game’s The Documentary 2 and singer-songwriter John Grant’s Grey Tickles, Black Pressure. Justin Bieber (Francois Mori/AP) \nIn the singles chart, Justin Bieber’s What Do You Mean? claimed the number one spot for the fifth week, making it the second longest number one of 2015, just one week behind Mark Ronson’s Uptown Funk. \nAt number two is R.City and Adam Levine’s Locked Away, while Drake scores his highest-charting single as a lead artist with Hotline Bling, which leaps from eight to number three. The Weeknd (Jack Plunkett/Invision) Share article \nCompleting the top five are Naughty Boy, Beyonce and Arrow Benjamin’s Runnin’ and The Weeknd’s The Hills, which leapt from 23rd place to fifth.
