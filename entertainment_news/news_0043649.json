This story was written by Hank Gallo.)\nShe’s a bit flustered, but hey, you’d be flustered too if some guy who is your unborn son’s best friend came back from the future to save you from a killing machine that’s hunting you down.\nAll right, so it’s rather confusing. But in the context of this wildly imaginative movie, it’s all, rather exciting, too. Let me try to explain. There’s this nuclear war, see, which was started by machines and now the machines are taking over.\nAnyway, the leader of the human revolution is a guy named John Conner. They can’t get to Conner, but the machines figure if they send a terminator back in time to kill Conner’s mother, there’ll be no Conner and, therefore, no resistance movement.\nAs one character puts it, “It’s sort of a retroactive abortion, huh?”\nArnold Schwarzenegger stars here as the title character - a man-like machine programmed to kill. It’s a part tailor-made for the muscle man - lots of action and very little talk. Linda Hamilton, a pretty blond, is his charming prey and Michael Biehn is just fine as her tough-talking, fast-acting protector.\nThe real star here, however, is the story - written by director James Cameron with Gale Anne Hurd. It’s so good, in fact, you almost forget the film’s flaws - like the cartoony look of the war-ravaged future. Here, the most absurd excursion is believable and we go along willingly - stopping now and then for a breath or a laugh.\nAnd the occasional laughs, incidentally, keep the movie from taking itself too seriously. Even at the end - when we know all too well what the future holds for the heroine - we smile at the jeep she drives into the forbidding storm clouds. It’s a Renegade.\nTags: archives", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:57:39.048+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
