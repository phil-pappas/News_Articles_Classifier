The couple are parents to three children - Kingston, Zuma and Apollo. \nDuring her MasterCard Priceless Surprises concert in New York City on Saturday, Gwen debuted her new single, called \"Used to Love You.\" \n\"I just want to share a song that I wrote recently,\" she told fans. \"This song is really special.\" \nLyrics to the track include the line: \"I thought I was the best thing that ever happened to you/I guess nobody taught you how to love.\" \nIn the months after the split, Gwen has been recording new music, which she told U.S. magazine People was \"just truth.\" She's also returned to \"The Voice,\" alongside fellow judges Blake Shelton, Adam Levine and Pharrell.
