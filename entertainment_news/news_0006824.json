A previously unreleased track called \"Meet Me In The City\" dropped Thursday with the announcement (listen below). \nIn total, it's 52 tracks on four CDs, and four hours of never-before-seen video on three DVDs. Rolling Stone provides a complete track listing. \nAn accompanying book, with more than 200 photos from \"The River\" era, also comes with the set. \nPre-orders are available now on iTunes and Amazon. \n\"The River,\" The Boss's fifth LP, marked his greatest mainstream gains to that point. The album was his first No. 1 on the Billboard 200 (10 more have followed) and \"Hungry Heart\" was his first Top 10 hit. \"The River\" officially turns 35 Saturday. \nBobby Olivier may be reached at bolivier@njadvancemedia.com.
