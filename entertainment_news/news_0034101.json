Mirror has learnt that the maker's upcoming sci-fi film, Alien: Paradise Lost , slated to open in 2017, has a role going of an Indian scientist. The film rolls in Hungary in January and Irrfan might just hop time zones again to enter an alien universe.\nInterestingly, for Scott's sci-fi drama, The Martian , which hits screens today, the makers had approached Irrfan with the role of ISRO scientist Venkat Kapoor, moulded on Padma Shree awardee Dr. Subbiah Arunan. Dr.Arunan had played a prominent role in the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), which celebrated its first anniversary on September 24.\nThe film is based on Andy Weir's 2011 best seller, by the same name, and the author wanted an Indian actor to play the part. \"My first and only choice was Irrfan Khan,\" Andy, who has co-written the screenplay told Mirror. Irrfan who was juggling his dates between the Hollywood feature, Jurassic World and Shoojit Sircar's Piku, was keen to do the film. \"He had to back out due to a Bollywood contract conflict just three weeks before our shooting began,\" recalls Andy. \"I had to turn down a Ridley Scott Hollywood film for my other assignments,\" Irrfan had admitted to Mirror earlier (June 19). After completing Piku, Irrfan flew off to Budpest to film the American thriller, Inferno, based on Dan Brown's novel, with Tom Hanks.He also completed Meghna Gulzar's Talvar which opens today, and was recently shooting a Japanese TV miniseries, The Tokyo Trials, in Lithunia.\nSince Andy had an extremely short window to fill the second most important role in the story, he decided to tweak it a bit once it was clear that Irrfan would not come on board as Venkat.\n\"We no longer had the luxury of going after a specific ethnicity and just wanted to find another really good actor for the role,\" he reminisces. They ended up with British actordirector Chiwetel Ejiofor, best known for his role in the 2013 Oscar winning film, 12 Years A Slave. \"But we changed the character's name from Venkat Kapoor to Vincent Kapoor, who is halfblack and half-Indian, to make the role more authentic,\" admits Andy.\n Prometheus 2 - Official Trailer 2016\nExodus Amazon.in : INR 1,299.00 ", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities", "http://www.amazon.in/Exodus-Christian-Bale/dp/B00VREUMF6%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJP4GPDYQHXPFUOWQ%26tag%3Dtimofind-21%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB00VREUMF6", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516fYIw2CrL._SL160_.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/5FAYhUh8_8A", "https://www.pinterest.com/timesofindia/", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107628521107103264647/+TOIEntertainment/posts", "https://twitter.com/TOIEntertain"], "published": "2015-10-02T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T19:17:16.939+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
