(AP Photo/Thibault Camus) \nPARIS (AP) — Q branch is paying a visit to Paris with the arrival of nearly 20 cars featured in James Bond films over the years. From the Sunbeam Alpine in the 1962 “Dr. No” to this year’s Aston Martin, the cars paraded down the Champs Elysees on Sunday after arraying in front of the Arc de Triomphe. \nMinus the submarine car from “The Spy Who Loved Me,” the display comes before the release of “Spectre” this fall and includes the Aston Martin DB10 created for the film, which features in a chase scene through the streets of Rome. \nThe film will be released on Nov. 6 in the U.S. and Oct. 26 in Britain.
