From native 4K to Full HD 3D resolution, the new Sony Home Theater projectors are packed with the latest innovative technologies to make home theater more enjoyable for end users and friendlier to install for dealers.\nNew 4K models\nThe new projectors include the VPL-VW665ES and VPL-VW365ES, which deliver native 4K resolution for a truly immersive viewing experience. These projectors are the successors to Sony's hugely popular VPL-VW600ES and VPL-VW350ES projectors, and a new long-lasting lamp gives both up to 6,000 hours of performance, with high brightness and high contrast for even more vibrant images.\nSony is unrivalled in its ability to offer breath-taking image quality through native 4K resolution, and the VPL-VW665ES is compatible with HDMI input of HDR (High Dynamic Range) content with a 300,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio. HDR imagery comes closest to the reality our eyes see every day, with higher contrast, deeper blacks, and exceptional dynamic range. Sony is developing HDR support across its portfolio and the VPL-VW665ES gives home cinema enthusiasts the opportunity to experience total immersion in whatever they are watching.\nThe new VPL-VW665ES and VPL-VW365ES use advanced SXRD ™ panels for a native 4K picture, with no artificial manipulation of pixels. Rich and accurate color reproduction is ensured by Sony's proprietary TRILUMINOS ™ engine design, while Motionflow picture technology serves to deliver clearer, less blurry images when watching fast-paced, cinematic or sports action.\nBoth new models allow users to enjoy up-to-date 4K content services through the latest connectivity options using the latest HDMI standard and HDCP 2.2. A built-in RF 3D transmitter provides interface to industry-standard 3D glasses with a strong wireless signal for wider coverage and 3D synchronization stability. Professional calibration features allow operators to expertly adjust the picture to suit the viewers' tastes. These color correction tools allow access to adjust the hue, saturation, and brightness of each color and the color space for red, green, blue respectively, to their desired level.\n\"Ten years after introducing the world's first 4K projectors for the industry conversion from film-based to digital cinema in neighborhood theaters, Sony is releasing our next generation of 4K projectors for use in home theaters. These latest models continue to expand our support for enthusiasts and dealers with features like HDR and IP control,\" said Andre Floyd , Product Manager for projectors at Sony Electronics Inc. \"By improving brightness, contrast and lamp life, and providing great calibration tools, we deliver users out-of-the-box optimized picture quality while enabling installation experts to tweak the image to meet the needs of a particular environment or a viewer's taste. Sony's 4K SXRD imaging technology remains the state of the art in home theater projection.\"\nNew VPL-HW65ES\nThe new VPL-HW65ES also launches at CEDIA, using full HD SXRD panels while borrowing interface and processing technology from its 4K cousins. The new model brings an advanced Reality Creation to the Full HD home theater experience along with higher brightness and longer lamp life of 6,000 hours. It also provides a built in RF 3D transmitter and a USB update function to enable the device's firmware to be updated via a simple download and thumb drive transfer. The added IP control interface gives the projector versatile home automation compatibility, which combines with its compact size and front exhaust for a range of flexible installation solutions.\nPC-based Calibration Tool for 4K and HD models\nNow installers can take advantage of Projector Calibration Pro software on HD through 4K Sony home theater models, allowing them to manipulate all of a projector's features from a simple PC interface, including the sophisticated color calibration tools. Setup configurations can be saved to a file to upload to any future installations, making future calibrations that much quicker. Additional adjustments made for a particular client can be saved in a separate file that will allow the installer to easily recall their original calibrations if ever needed to tweak that client's system in the future.\nThe new projectors will be available in October 2015 at a suggested retail price of $3,999 for the VPL-HW65ES, $9,999 for the VPL-VW365ES and $14,999 for the VPL-VW665ES.\nSony is exhibiting at the CEDIA Sony Booth #3701 .
