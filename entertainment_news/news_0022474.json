CBS Studios describes the new MacGyver thusly: “A reimagining of the television series of the same name, following a 20-something MacGyver as he gets recruited into a clandestine organization where he uses his knack for solving problems in unconventional ways to help prevent disasters from happening.” James Wan, who had a huge hit with this summer's Furious 7 , will executive produce and direct the pilot. According to the Hollywood Reporter , this isn't the first attempt to reboot MacGyver , which ran from 1985 to 1992 on ABC and starred Richard Dean Anderson. Earlier attempts included a pilot called Young MacGyver and a 2012 movie Wan was planning to direct. All this would be exciting news if Will Forte hadn't already given us the only MacGyver reboot we'll ever need .
