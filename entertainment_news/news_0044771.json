A new deal would allow the satellite broadcaster to continue carrying 46 television stations in 38 markets across 33 states operated by Tegna. \nDish, based in Englewood, Colorado, released a statement late Friday saying it offered a short-term contract extension to Tegna while negotiations continued. Tegna, based in McLean, Virginia, said Dish routinely drops valued cable and broadcast channels and said it has always been able to reach a fair agreement with other providers without disrupting viewers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T18:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T20:32:00.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
