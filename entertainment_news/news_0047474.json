The shooting for Bruce Lee started in May and the shoot wrapped by the end of September – after just four months, leaving fans concerned that the rushed manner of filmmaking might compromise the quality of the film. \nAllaying all such fears, the film’s producer DVV Danayya says, “That is not at all a concern. Even though the film was made at a rapid pace, there is no question of compromising on its quality” \n“Had we done that, do you think Chiranjeevi garu would have given his consent to star in the film?,” he adds. \nDirected by Srinu Vaitla, Bruce Lee also features Rakul Preet Singh and is slated to hit screens on October16.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:51:24.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
