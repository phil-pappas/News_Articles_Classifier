Joshua Harmon’s off-Broadway hit, Bad Jews , now in a witty, thought-provoking regional premiere at Stage West, has been described as a comedy. There are plentiful laugh-out-loud lines, but also big things at stake for the cousins squabbling over an inheritance from their recently deceased grandfather.\nThe item in contention is a necklace with a golden chai, the Hebrew letter that means life. Their grandfather hid it under his tongue in a concentration camp during the Holocaust. As the now-prosperous grandchildren gather in a tasteful million-dollar Manhattan studio after the funeral, Daphna asserts a claim to the necklace based on her devotion to carrying their Jewish heritage into the future.\nHer cousin, Jonah, doesn’t want anything to do with the matter, but his older brother, Liam, rejects her request with a ferocity that taps into the thorny question of what parts of Jewish history and tradition should be passed to the next generation.\nKelsey Milbourn’s driven Daphna powers the play with nervous, determined energy, orating her impassioned opinions to Jonah, played by Matthew Grondin with a quiet, wounded perplexity that testifies to the power of reacting.\nLiam, a brilliant Ph.D. student, delivered with angry, pent-up intelligence by Garret Storms, articulates secularist convictions that tackle Daphna’s religious ones loathing for loathing. Because their grandfather asked their grandmother to marry him using the chai, Liam wants to plumb the romantic, rather than the painful aspects of the past, using it to propose to his non-Jewish girlfriend, Melody, played by Alexandra Lawrence with bubbly verve.\nFor Daphna, the idea that the chai would go to a woman who doesn’t know or care about the suffering involved in bringing this necklace through war rejects everything she’s fighting to preserve.\nRichard Allen’s masterful direction of a fine cast achieves gripping tension in a battle where both Daphna and Liam are right and wrong and Melody and Jonah are wild cards, with pivotal roles to play.\nBad Jews taps into the universal question about what we should do with a legacy of a painful past, posed by August Wilson in his 1990 Pulitzer Prize winner, The Piano Lesson . Surprisingly, the answer in Bad Jews is darkly funny as well as complicated and worth continued exploration.\nPlan your life\nContinues through Nov. 1 at Stage West, 821 W.
