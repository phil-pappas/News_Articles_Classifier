He was one of the FBI's most wanted fugitives until he was captured in Santa Monica, California, in 2011. He and Greig had been living together in a rent-controlled apartment.\nWhen Greig was sentenced on the original charges in 2012, her lawyer, Kevin Reddington , said Greig was in love with Bulger when she fled with him and did not believe that Bulger was capable of murder.\nIn 2013, Bulger was convicted of playing a role in 11 murders and other charges in a sweeping racketeering indictment.\nProsecutors said Greig had numerous opportunities to leave Bulger during their time on the run. Instead, they said she helped him remain a fugitive by using false identities and posing as his wife so she could pick up his prescriptions.\nThe couple posed as married retirees from Chicago. After they were captured, authorities found a stash of more than $800,000 in cash and 30 weapons in their apartment.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:27:58.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
