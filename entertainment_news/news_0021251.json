LOL! I don't enjoy one moment of it and I don't understand people who enjoy it. \n\"Maybe it's the swelling, the backaches or just the complete mindf**k of how your body expands and nothing fits. I just always feel like I'm not in my own skin. \n\"People just don't tell you all of the gross things that happen during pregnancy or after. Do you know you basically have to wear a diaper for two months afterwards! LOL! No one told me that! #SoSexy (sic).\" celebrity", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:57:49.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
