This Year, bTrade’s MFT Nation Blog Will Post A Series Of What We Call “Case Studies Of What Not-To-Do” In The World Of Data Security.\nGlendale, California USA (PRWEB) October 13, 2015\nRecognizing the importance of good data security practices, the U.S. federal government has designated October as National Cyber Security Awareness Month (NCSAM). According to the Department of Homeland Security, NCSAM is designed to “engage and educate public and private sector partners through events and initiatives with the goal of raising awareness about cyber security and increasing the resiliency of the nation in the event of a cyber incident.”\nbTrade , the industry leading compression and managed file transfer (MFT) provider, today announced that it will participate in NCSAM again this year through a variety of events/initiatives designed to raise awareness of data security, including a series of blogs of what we call “case studies of what not-to-do” in the world of data security.\nbTrade’s case studies contain factual information that is sourced from documents filed in public cases/proceedings. These documents, combined with bTrade’s years of data security experience, give readers a unique look into how others drew scrutiny from regulators. Steve Zapata, bTrade’s CEO and President, described the purpose behind the case studies: “We offer these case studies because they can act as a preventative, of sorts. In our experience, there are few things more fundamental to successful data security practices than learning from what others did poorly, and then taking steps to ensure that you don’t go down the same path.”\nThe first case study has already been posted.
