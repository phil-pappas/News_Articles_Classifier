Also, we do not see any motive for a prison official to have helped her to attempt suicide. ”If that is the case, we will not hesitate to issue suspension orders for anybody who tried to help her attempt suicide,” the official, who is privy to investigation headed by IG (Prisons) into the suspected drug overdose, told PTI. (Also Read: BJP whipping up communal passion ahead of Bihar polls: CPM) “When these logical ways of the drug reaching her seem a very distant possibility, what we are focusing now is if somebody tried to poison her. The investigating officer is recording statements of everybody who comes in contact with Indrani in the jail, including prison officials, other inmates and cooks,” the official said on condition of anonymity. There is a prison doctor present at all times, under the supervision of whom inmates are given medicines, the official said. “Thus, we do not think she can store any medicine with her. The doctor, at all times, ensures that inmates consume medicines in their presence.” Indrani, accused of murdering her 24-year-old daughter Sheena Bora, is currently recuperating at JJ Hospital where she was admitted on Friday after being taken from Byculla prison in an unconscious state. Later that day, the State Government asked IG (Prisons) Bipin Kumar Singh to inquire if the 43-year-old, who is in judicial custody, overdosed on drugs. Meanwhile, Principal Home Secretary (Prisons) Vijay Satbir Singh said Kumar will submit his report to the Home Department by the evening of October 9. Indrani was arrested on August 25 by Khar Police for the April 2012 murder of Sheena, her daughter from an earlier marriage. Besides Indrani, her former husband Sanjeev Khanna and driver Shyam Rai are the two other accused in the sensational murder case. \n  9:02 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T18:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:20:08.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
