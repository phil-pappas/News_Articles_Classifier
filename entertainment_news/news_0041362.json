Belconnen Community Theatre until October 10. Bookings:  stagecenta.com .\nIt is school holiday time and theatre companies have young audiences in mind. Children's theatre company Ickle Pickle Productions is celebrating 10 years of shows for young children with a revival of its successful adaptation of Goldilocks and the Three Bears . Written by Peter McDonald, with music by Adam Bluhm, and nominated for a 2006 CAT Award, Goldilocks returns to the Belconnen Community Theatre under the direction of Justin Watson.\nIckle Pickle's version is no simple retelling of Goldilocks' adventure in the home of the three bears, although she does eat Baby Bear's porridge, break his chair and fall asleep in his bed. McDonald's version reveals a far more intriguing back story to the popular tale. The evil Sheriff of Gunningham (Peter Fock), aided and abetted by his dim-witted offsider, Frogmore (Jenny Watson) is out to steal the Bears' porridge recipe. He kidnaps Goldilocks (Jenny Lange) but is thwarted by Dave, the tree feller (Pip Carroll), his chum, Charlie the chipmunk (Callum Doherty) and Goldilocks' mother (Miriam Miley-Read). They are helped by Father Bear (Michael Jordan), Mother Bear (Bronwyn Edwards) and Baby Bear (Katy Larkin) who, through stealth and guile, some courage and a rather dubious porridge recipe join the company's ensemble of bears to bring the show to a happy musical ending.\nMcDonald revels in corny puns and topical references, with enough comedy, colour and movement to keep young members of the audience glued to their seats and enough subtlety to keep adults amused from beginning to end.\nAdvertisement Watson keeps the action moving, cleverly casting for comical effect with an eye for the absurd in height contrasts, and entertaining the audience with on-stage porridge preparation, slapstick, a chase scene and a quiz show sequence to build the excitement.\nBluhm's musical numbers, choreographed by Vicky Harvey, give the young ensemble performers ample opportunity for enthusiastic participation in the show, and Wayne Shepherd's colourful set provides an effective backdrop to a show that offers an hour of entertainment at the best price in town. \nAffordable and enjoyable, Ickle Pickle's anniversary revival of Goldilocks not only offers young actors, singers and dancers the chance to perform with more experienced and adept actors and production mentors, but also offers families original, quirky and entertaining children's theatre during the school holiday period.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T01:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T06:19:50.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
