Hard to believe, we know. But let's lay out the evidence. \nDirector J.J. Abrams says one question convinced him to take up \"Episode VII.\" That's, \"Who is Luke Skywalker?\" \nThat question came from Kathleen Kennedy, who also says, \"characters who are conflicted between good and evil, dark and light ... that's a big part of the themes inside of Episode VII.\" \nWe haven't seen much of Luke yet. And what we have seen looks ominous. We do know the real Luke (Mark Hamill) wanted to break bad. \nAnyway, it makes sense.
