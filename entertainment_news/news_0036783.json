One big, happy undead family. \"The Walking Dead’s\" Season 6 premiere, “First Time Again,” brought in some new characters, developed a large plot to draw the walkers away from the quarry and shed a bit more light on the Wolves. \nFirst let me pause to briefly introduce myself. I’m part of the community coordinators team here at The Sun, where I help with social media, manage The Darkroom photo blog and produce video. I’ve been watching \"The Walking Dead\" religiously for about three years now, and am really looking forward to writing reviews. \nSo, we picked up just about where we left off in the Season 5 finale, with Rick capping Pete in front of a town square meeting of the Alexandrians. It was an important moment for us to relive, because it marked the change in Deanna’s attitude towards Rick and his methods. \nHer preoccupation with her husband’s death seems directly tied in with her support for Rick. \nWhen they arrived, she allowed his group to enter, but kept them at arm’s length, as one is wont to do in this “insane world.” We, as the assumed supporters of Rick and Co., are on his side. We’ve watched him lead his group and protect his own for years. She was smart not to trust him, and smart to trust him. Official World Premiere trailer: Fear the Walking Dead (2015) \nWhat did the world look like as it was transforming into the horrifying apocalypse depicted in \"The Walking Dead\"? This spin-off set in Los Angeles, following new characters as they face the beginning of the end of the world, will answer that question.

They don't know that Rick isn't a shoot-first, ask questions later type. They only see what they can: He is the unknown. \nFor Deanna, it took watching her husband’s throat cut to realize what she needed to do. For Nicholas, it was Glenn almost killing him. And as the Season 6 premiere episode developed, it was clear there were still a few dissenters in the ranks, namely Carter. \nAnd with Carter’s passing, not long after he joined Team Rick (“He got bit, right in the face”), I’m fairly certain that the town as a whole will follow Rick’s lead -- even Morgan, whose humanity served to bring Rick back from the brink. AMC's zombie drama stands on its own in order to keep fans guessing about who lives and who dies. \nI found that Morgan and Rick’s conversations in this episode were very much about that. Rick is torn between his fierce desire to protect his family and his ability to convince the Alexandrians that they need to rethink the way they protect themselves. \nBut acting like the Governor is not the way to do it. \nMorgan speaks the episode's title words, “first time again,” in one part of these conversations. It’s a first time again for the two of them to meet, and it’s a first time again for Rick to ingratiate himself with the townspeople. \nMaggie touched on this as well in her chat with Annie, and really brought it home. At one point, Maggie and Annie were enemies, just like Glenn and Nicholas. But maybe the way the world works now -- the way it has to work -- is that people need to give each other second chances in order to survive as a community. \nOut on the road, it’s kill or be killed, but that way doesn’t work inside these walls. It’s their first time again, because they’re getting another chance. \nThe plot that unfolded in disorder -- like a Tarantino film -- was driven mostly by Rick's plan to draw away a massive herd of walkers from a nearby quarry, so that they can't head toward the town. It seemed as if they were trying to draw the herd so far away that it wouldn’t be a threat. \nBut this is \"The Walking Dead,\" an obedient follower of Murphy's law, and nothing ever goes according to plan. \nEnter the inauspicious Wolves. About all we know about them so far is that they carve a W into walkers’ foreheads (a la \" Inglourious Basterds\" ) and they seem to be cunning and dangerous. \nOstensibly, they’re responsible for screwing up Rick’s plan to move the herd. \nThe last thing I want to mention is Jessie and Rick’s brief interaction, which followed Rick having a stern, fatherly moment with her son, Ron. \nJessie seems to have cooled off to Rick. Gee, I don’t know -- maybe it was watching him pop her husband in the face? \nEven though Pete was an abusive alcoholic, that doesn’t necessarily mean she wanted him dead. And I’m sure she did not want to watch it happen. (It’s easy for us to yell “kill him!” at our TVs while watching a show where life, for all intents and purposes, is cheap.) \nWhat’s perhaps worse, in her eyes, is that he’s now acting like a father to her son. Jessie doesn’t seem to want to deal with the drama anymore, and who could blame her. \nRating : I’ve decided to “rate” or “grade” my reviews using katanas as the currency. The range will be 1 katana to 4 katanas. And this premiere gets 3 katanas . \nBest zombie kill : I want to include the best zombie kill of the episode each week, but I didn’t see any that stood out much to me. There was some great gore, as our zombies continue to decay, but no great kill that I can recall. Leave it in the comments if you disagree. \nLastly, some stray observations and favorite quotes… With all of these new characters, I worry that the main characters’ time will be diluted. What is going on with Sasha? I really, really like the black-and-white flashback footage. It helped with the mixed narrative and looked strikingly beautiful at times. I hope they continue to use it. They must have said “s---” 3-4 times, which seems high for cable. “Did you take one of my protein bars?” - Morgan “I’m supposed to be delivering pizzas, man” - Glenn Okay, so how were they able to fill those orange balloons with helium? Anybody else bothered by that? I’m a huge nut for continuity in shows, and staying within the confines of the universe. In that context, how would they have a helium cannister? “You always seem ready … to handle things,” Morgan says to Carol. I’m not sure how Morgan got to be so perceptive about humans while spending all that time alone. I also thought this would be some foreshadowing for future Carol badassery. “I’m just grabbing the bull by the nutsack. I’m livin’, darlin’. Just like you.” - Abraham may have some of the best all-time Walking Dead quotes. \nThanks for reading and watching!
