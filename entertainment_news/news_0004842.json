Illegal Israeli occupation is the primary reason for the regular fighting’, said the singer, who is also a UN Goodwill Ambassador for Palestine . \nAssaf said he deplored all forms of violence, and particularly fatalities, but described the horrific spiral as the ‘result of oppressive policies and a blanket ban on all Palestinian dissent.’ \n‘People have reached breaking point because they’re subjugated. This is because of the apartheid regime, the continuous expansion of illegal settlements, the outlawed demolition of Palestinian homes and farms and the daily humiliation at checkpoints. \n‘It’s also because of the constant military offensives, persecutions and lack of hope, and the routine extra-judicial killings and unauthorised detentions, including that of children,’ he said. \n‘Palestinians are taking action because of these terrible injustices. This is not new, but things are getting worse, and increased repression, including collective punishment, only leads to more trouble. All Palestinians want is to be a free, independent people, and to live with dignity.’ \nReferring to the more immediate cause of the latest cycle of violence, Assaf suggested that ‘the Arab League should take charge of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, over Jordan. This will prevent future provocations and illegal incursions by Jewish extremists who want to pray there while being offered protection by Israeli forces.’ \n‘Al-Aqsa Mosque is the third holiest site in Islam and Palestinians won’t allow any attempt to turn it into a Jewish Temple and Judaise Jerusalem’, said Assaf. \nDiscussing the political relevance of The Idol, Assaf said: ‘I’m very proud of the film, not just because it’s my life story, but because it’s about the Palestinian struggle, especially of those blockaded within Gaza’. \nSpeaking for the first time about their relationship, Lina said the couple’s engagement party was held last month in Ramallah, near Beit El, the place where much of the latest violence is happening. \nShe said she was ‘particularly distressed by the number of children being killed,’ and told of her horror at the story of Rahaf Hassan, a three-year-old girl who died alongside her pregnant mother, Noor, during an Israeli airstrike on Gaza last Sunday. \nCalling Rahaf a ‘little angel’, Lina said she had been moved to tears by an online video that showed the child’s corpse being hugged and kissed by her inconsolable father. \nLina added that ‘footage of rubble and devastation in Gaza’ shown in The Idol ‘summed up the ongoing situation.’ \nThere is one scene that evokes the haunting images of the four boys playing football on a beach last summer before being blown to pieces by Israeli ordnance. \nA scene in The Idol evoking the haunting images of the four boys playing football on a beach in Gaza last summer before being blown to pieces by Israeli ordnance.

In turn, Israel lost 66 soldiers and five civilians to rocket and commando raids. \nKnife and gun attacks are currently breaking out across Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories almost daily, with serious casualties on both sides. \nSince the beginning of the month at least 32 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire and nearly 2000 have been wounded in Israeli attacks. \nMeanwhile eight Israelis died in assaults, including one in which a victim was run over by a car and then hacked to death by a man using an axe. Numerous others have been injured in stabbing and firearm incidents. \nBy Nabila Ramdani © 2000 - 2015 Al Bawaba (www.albawaba.com) Rate Article:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T11:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T11:53:16.487+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
