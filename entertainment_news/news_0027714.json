There has been bountiful evidence nationwide that minority members can receive longer sentences than white people for the same crimes, said Burnette, a retired ombudsman with the Finger Lakes Developmental Disabilities Service Office. Is the same true here, he asked a panel of individuals who work within the criminal justice system.\nUnite Rochester is an initiative of the Democrat and Chronicle that looks for solutions to the community’s racial inequities, so the second annual Court Academy was a fitting event for the question. But, as answers showed, the response is not clear-cut.\nCity Court Judge Stephen Miller said many factors go into a sentence beyond the criminal conviction itself. A defendant’s criminal past and the specifics of the crime itself — did the burglary occur at a time when people were probably home, for example — are only a few of the “many variables” a judge must consider, he said.\nThe goal of comparing sentences across race and ethnicity is “admirable,” he said. “However, it’s very difficult.”\nStill, Assistant Public Defender Andre Vitale said, it’s important that judges be alerted if a sentence appears disparate from those handed out by other judges, or even, on some occasions, the same judge. He said he gathers information that, while anecdotal, could indicate imbalanced sentences along socioeconomic strata.\nWhen he sees an apparent inequity at sentencing, Vitale said, he’ll encourage the judge to consider whether the pending sentence is fair.\nThe questions about sentencing arose after two hours of detailed presentations about the court and jury system — presentations designed to reduce some of the mystery of the judicial system and encourage people to find ways to get involved.\nRochester resident Hasana Martin said she found the session educational and revealing, but wishes a similar presentation could be taken into the schools where young people could perhaps be impacted. “It can make a difference for more people who are young,” she said.\nMartin was one of about 50 people at the event at Asbury First United Methodist Church.\nGCRAIG@Gannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:31:42.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
