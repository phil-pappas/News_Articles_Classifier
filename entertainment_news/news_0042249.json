Especially when she abandons him there (first, helping herself to all his money). What's a promoter to do? Well, if you're Richie Lanz, you find yourself something to promote. \nEven if it's a shy Afghan girl singing Cat Stevens tunes. \nSure, there's a set-up for a story here, if you don't mind corny clichés about American soldiers and almost universally demeaning Arab and Muslim stereotypes (and clearly screenwriter Mitch Glazer, an old pal of Murray's, does not). But there's no actual story. \nInstead the plot jumps in fits and starts, like a badly battered jeep. Crazy characters and guest stars – Bruce Willis as a clenched-jaw mercenary, Danny McBride as an arms-dealer dude – pop in and out arbitrarily. Logic falls by the wayside. (I understand why Murray's client took his money – but why did she bother stealing his passport?) \nThere's also the character of Merci, played by Kate Hudson, a glamorous long-legged call girl who splits her time servicing millionaire warlords and tag-teaming the entire regiment in her double-wide trailer, while still looking like hippie-princess Kate Hudson . Right. She quickly becomes Bill Murray's girlfriend, too. \nThis review will now pause for a minute, while you fully consider all the bizarre old-man wish-fulfillment within that last paragraph. \nOK, done? \nWell, good because all that really leaves us with is Murray, and he's still, occasionally, a lot of fun. A simple closeup of that battered old face in fiercely won repose is worth a smile; to hear him throwing out one tall tale after another about his former clients (he knew Madonna when she was \"just Donna\") is enough to start the chuckles. \nBut \"Rock the Kasbah\" needs more than chuckles. It needs some big laughs. It needs a smarter script. It needs at least two or three perfectly engineered, joke-after-joke sequences. It needs a smart director – did you really do \"Wag the Dog,\" Levinson? – whose idea of political satire goes beyond freshman-year sarcasm. \nWhat it's got is Bill Murray. And for the first time in a long while, that's not enough. \nRatings note: The film contains violence, strong language, substance abuse and sexual situations. 'Rock the Kasbah' (R) Open Road (101 min.) Directed by Barry Levinson. With Bill Murray, Kate Hudson, Bruce Willis.
