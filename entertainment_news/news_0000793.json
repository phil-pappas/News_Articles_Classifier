Patrick McElhenneyFOX, used with permission \" Bones \" kicked off its 11th season with Booth in trouble, and the Thursday, Oct. 8 episode saw the team find him and Brennan tell him she's going back to work at the Jeffersonian â€“ and she thinks he should return to his job at the FBI because he's clearly not done doing what he does best. So what comes next? Emily Deschanel and executive producer Michael Peterson spoke with reporters to tease what's coming up.\nThe focus of \"Bones\" season 11 \"is making sure to have as much time as possible with Booth and Brennan,\" Peterson shared. \"That is the heart of the show.\" The EP went back over hiatus and watched the early seasons of the series. \"For instance, watching the pilot, it talks a lot about the first book that Temperance writes and how it's inspired by each one of the characters on the show and that led to a fun storyline that is coming up I think in Episode 4 where there's a twist in Brennan's latest novel that is a sharp departure, but it leads to some pretty good back and forth between Booth and Brennan as a result of it,\" he teased.\nWhile it seemed like Brennan was okay with Booth lying to her by the time she was reunited with him in episode 2, is that something that's going to be brought up again? After all, he had lied to her last season about the gambling as well. \"We'll get into it some,\" Peterson shared, adding that if Booth had been found after one episode, Brennan wouldn't have necessarily had the same reaction. \"I think that Brennan would have hit him a lot harder as far as accusations, but through the course of the second episode, what we're trying to get to is she understands who she is better through this case, that she belongs at the lab,\" he explained. \"In discovering where she belongs she also understands Booth better, that Booth is this man of action. The way that we say it internally here is Booth is a little bit of a Superman and Superman can't just sit by and watch as people suffer. There really is no retiring for him, so by the end of the second episode Brennan understands that she belongs in the lab and that her Superman, Booth, belongs out there in the field saving people. She understands him in a way that probably nobody else could, so while a lot of people would yell at him saying you lied to me, she understands it's just who he is and she wouldn't want him to be any other way.\"\nLooking ahead to the rest of the season, episode 10, the mid-season finale, will see \"a major shake-up\" for Hodgins and Angela that is also related to Aubrey. (That episode is actually one they considered for the premiere.) \"It will change the trajectory of the rest of the season,\" according to the EP. \"When Jon Collier and I were handed this gift to be able to work on this show and be able to be showrunners this year, we wanted to make sure that we shook things up, and so there are going to be many, many major arcs. We don't want to get complacent in the fact that Booth and Brennan are married and everyone is coupled up. We want to challenge them, but not in any kind of artificial way. We want it to be character-led. So, we're going to have lots of arcs going for each of the people this season.\"\nAs far as \"big bads\" this season, there's a \"very interesting version\" of one with the \"Sleepy Hollow\" crossover, during which they find two sets of remains, one of them very, very old. Episode 10 features \"the biggest bad\" that they're going to come across, but since he didn't want to give too much away, all Peterson would tease is that it's \"something that impacts Hodgins, Angela and Aubrey very directly.\"\nThere is going to be another undercover episode this season, and it's \"a different version of undercover\" than they've done before. \"It's going to be very playful, competitive,\" he said.\n\"Bones\" season 11 airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. on Fox .", "external_links": ["http://fox.com/bones"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:31:17.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
