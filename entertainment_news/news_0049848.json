His success, especially with the latter, merited him another ABS-CBN show titled “Celebrity Playtime” which airs its second episode tonight before “Home Sweetie Home.”\nBILLY CRAWFORD\nArnel Natividad, director of “Celebrity Playtime” (and “Tonight With Boy Abunda,” “Family Feud”), said Billy is a perfect fit for his new show.\nAs for Billy, he said he just delivers the needed energy and vibe in his hosting to make his audience happy. He really loves hosting and the warm interaction he has with his audience.\nThe new show for him also encourages personal interaction amid the era of social media.\nThe celebrity contestants featured last Saturday were Melai Cantiveros, Nyoy Volante, Edgar Allan Guzman, and Karla Estrada from the first season of “YFSF” versus some of the lucky stars of “Kapamilya Deal Or No Deal” like Long Mejia, Dennis Padilla, Eric Nicolas and Epi Quizon.\n• • •\nHOW SAM LOVES\nLove the Sam Milby way is simple: it’s all or nothing.\nThe 31-year-old actor revealed he is ready to settle down and have a family in three to four years’ time. And when he does, there won’t be a prenuptial agreement.\n“When you make an oath under God, when you get married, you’re saying kahit kailan hindi tayo maghihiwalay, no matter what happens – the good times and the bad, hindi tayo maghihiwalay,” he explained.\nHis personal take on the subject of prenuptial agreements is that it could cast a negative vibe on a wedding. Sam doesn’t like that.\nSAM MILBY and Jennylyn Mercado, stars of ‘The PreNup’\n“Hanggang forever dapat. I do believe in forever. May forever talaga and that’s the Milby way,” he said with a smile.\nSam also believes the right woman for him will come at the right time. This means he is not going to rush into marriage and family life.\n“I think pagdating sa pag-ibig it’s something you can’t really rush. Kahit papaano, I’m still very young. But in terms of having a family I’m not rushing (into it). You know I have a lot of blessings; I’m very busy too and I’m happy. That will come when the time is right.”\nSam Milby stars in “The Prenup” with Jennylyn Mercado. By award-winning filmmaker Jun Lana, the movie opens on Oct. 14 in nationwide cinemas.\nAside from “The Prenup,” Sam has already began taping for “Written In Our Stars,” his latest ABS-CBN soap opera. In the works, too, is his 10th anniversary concert set on Nov. 28 at the Kia Theater.\nSam said, “Malaking blessing itong movie working for the first time with a new leading lady. I just feel very blessed that over the years, sobrang daming blessings and sobrang daming leading ladies I’ve been able to work with.”\n• • •\nTIDBITS: Happy b-day greetings today, Oct. 3, go to Rio Locsin, Tessa Mauricio-Arriola, Edward Maceda, Beth J.
