If Cosby hopes accusers would stop coming forward, he hopes in vain.\n\"I can assure Mr. Cosby that there are still more victims who will be courageous enough to come forward in the future,\" Allred declared. \"It is vital that the women who assert that they are victims speak out, because the sheer magnitude of the number of victims, the similarity and common themes of what they state happened to them, coupled with their sincerity, are what we want the public to know.\n\"Each story must be told because there can never be accountability without truth and there can never be enough truth,\" she said.\nGloria Allred at press conference with new accusers of Bill Cosby Oct. 23, 2015, in New York City. (Photo: Mark Sagliocco, Getty Images)\nThe two accusers presented Friday tell stories separated by two decades.\nBarrett says she was officiating at an international track meet at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia in April 2004, when a man she said was Cosby grabbed her from behind and forcefully pulled her onto his groin, saying, \"Hey, back that thing up here, girl, back it on up!\"\nShe cried out and tried to escape. \"He had me locked down against his body without my consent or desire,\" she said. He left quickly, and she complained to other officials. \"But no one knew what to do.\"\nDottye said her encounter with Cosby took place in 1984, when she sought out Cosby to audition for a role on The Cosby Show at his New York home. When she got there, he gave her a drink to relax, and she became sick and disoriented. She said he helped her take off her clothes to wash up, then raped her multiple times.\n\"I couldn’t believe the man I respected as an actor and educator was doing this to me,\" she said. \"I couldn’t understand why I could not, did not, fight him off. I could not believe what was happening to me.\" Then he escorted her to the door and left her to make her way home to New Jersey on her own.\nDays later, she said, he invited her to watch the taping of his show, and she agreed because, as an actress, writer and director, she wanted to learn from him, even if she no longer placed him on a pedestal.\n\"I did not go to the police because at that time, I thought somehow I had let him do what he did,\" she said. \"I didn’t protest and I was too embarrassed to tell anyone of this shame I felt. Anyway, he was Bill Cosby! Who would believe me?\"\nUSA TODAY\nBill Cosby now being used as a cudgel in political attack ad\nEventually, she received a personalized Cosby Show jacket meant for cast and crew. She wanted to burn it but now is glad she didn't.\n\"It is a statement that I was there,\" she said. \"I am not lying.\"\nCosby, who has denied all wrongdoing and has never been charged with a crime, does not issue statements or comments when accusers come forward — something that's happened almost weekly for the past year since the accusations against him re-surfaced last fall.\nUSA TODAY\nCosby mural in D.C. defaced with picture of grinning dictator Kim Jung Un\nThe allegations have destroyed Cosby's career, while his heretofore benevolent personal image has been defaced, literally and figuratively. He's lost gigs, scores of honorary degrees and honors, and is battling at least six civil suits and even possible criminal charges.\nAllred is one of six lawyers handling civil suits against Cosby; as lawyer for plaintiff Judy Huth, who says Cosby raped her at the Los Angeles Playboy Mansion in 1974, Allred has already spent a day grilling Cosby for a deposition and says she is seeking to question him some more.\nBill Cosby, who's been a beloved comedian and sitcom star for decades, has been accused of sexually assaulting multiple women. Cosby, 77, who was never criminally charged in any case, settled a civil suit in 2006 with a woman over an alleged incident two years before, The Associated Press reported.
