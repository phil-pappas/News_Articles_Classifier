Lyle Kinsey Posted Oct. 16, 2015 at 11:30 PM Life brims with remembered coming of age parties, Pivotal moments that linger in our memories, Like cherished stains on a favorite shirt, Or gouged scratches on a dining room table, Or pennants left hanging on a bedroom wall. For many it’s the first red or blue tricycle, The ability to move independently and free. Then came the first two-wheeled sensation, A practice in balanced mobility and exploration. We lived counting the days when we could drive, Moving from one beater to today’s high-tech marvels. Two seaters to four seaters to six with luggage rack, As family grew, so did the number of cars or trucks. Planning for the empty nest, we again simplified, Joyously returning to fewer vehicles, smaller in size, We saw other amenities dwindle as bodies failed, Looking for alternatives to costly transportation. Today, it’s the geezer bike that marks a passage, Again we peddle a three wheeler, our balance compromised, Like in the earlier years when we toddled to our tricycle, And found new worlds we’d never explored, never noticed. Yesterday’s fifty dollar wonder is a Smithsonian exhibit, Marveled at for it utter simplicity and utilitarian design, Today’s is a fifteen-hundred dollar marvel that delights, Yet, takes trained technician to assemble and service. Life brims with coming of age moments and stories, Moving us to a tomorrow that is not certain or sure, The end of the road becomes the certainty and promise While we slowly peddle our three wheeler and smile.
