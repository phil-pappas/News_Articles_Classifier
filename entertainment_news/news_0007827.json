It is unclear if he spoke or nodded. \nThe former NBA player also gave ex Khloe Kardashian a thumbs up as he said, \"Hey, baby\" before falling back asleep, a source told E! News . \nKardashian has been waiting by Odom's bedside in his Las Vegas hospital even though the two separated in 2013. \nOdom has been at Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas since Tuesday, when he was found unconscious at the Love Ranch, a legal brothel in Crystal, Nevada, where he allegedly spent $75,000 during a four-day stay . \nOdom subsequently had suffered from a heart attack and organ failure, and was placed in a medically induced coma and on dialysis on Wednesday. But now, sources tell E! that Odom is no longer using a breathing tube and functioning. \nOdom is surrounded by his family, including his kids. \n\"Thanks for your outpouring of prayers and support for our dad,\" his children Destiny and Lamar Odom Jr. said in the statement to ET. \"We are here with our family and friends. We appreciate everyone respecting our privacy at this time. We ask for your continued prayers.\" Â© 2015 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.
