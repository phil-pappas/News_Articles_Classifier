The male cat is 16 and the female is 10. Our vet told us several years ago to feed them less, and yet they are still too heavy! We feed them each no more than a half-cup daily of their dry food, which we leave out for them to eat. They don’t always finish the food. The cats were just checked out, and both had good teeth, probably due to their dry food diet. There were no health problems, except that the male vomits regularly, but he always has. We think it might be since he has always eaten too fast. Could they both have a metabolic problem? The male has had trouble jumping up over the years and now uses stairs to get into our bed. Our vet once suggested baby aspirin, but that didn’t do much. How can we get the weight off them? We want to keep them around as long as we can, so any advice would be great! — E.S.\nDear E.S.,\nI’m glad to hear that both cats are healthy except for their weight challenges. The first question I would ask is whether the cup you are using is really a cup. Typically, I recommend 1⁄4 cup of dry food per adult cat twice daily. Dry food is better for their dental health, as you have noted. If they are leaving some food behind and both are heavy, then you must be feeding them too much.\nGiven their ages, I would recommend blood work for both of them to assess their overall health. It would be helpful to establish a baseline. It might also detect if either has any underlying problems that might suggest their weights. Cats are not known for low thyroid levels but just the opposite when they eat a lot and lose weight. My guess is that they are not metabolically challenged or the food volume is too high.\nHow sedentary is their lifestyle in your home? Perhaps they need to play more. Clearly the vomiting has not adversely affected your male cat if he is still heavy. It may primarily be due to competitive and rapid eating behavior. Try feeding them separately in smaller volumes and ask your veterinarian about a prescription weight loss food.\nGetting the weight off will help mobility and prevent the possibility of diabetes or heart disease, both of which are more frequently seen with heavy cats. Diets can be tough, so good luck.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T15:08:36.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
