He recalls, \"I went and purchased a ring that we had seen together, maybe four or five months or so prior. I went back and purchased the ring and I just kind of had it stashed away in some old equipment. And I said, 'Will you reach in there and grab something for me?'\" \nJames then discovered the ring. \"It was the most beautiful diamond ring I had ever seen in my life. It was lit up by a light,\" James says. \"I said, 'What is that?' He just looked at me and said, 'Well...?' And I was just like 'Oh my goodness.'\" \nCeeLo, who's been married once before, says they'd kept the engagement a secret because \"our private life is sacred.\" He says wedding planning has not yet begun. \nCeeLo will release his new album, Heart Blanche , on November 13. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
