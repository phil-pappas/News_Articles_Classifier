The 38-year-old rapper took to Twitter to launch a tirade against the companies that included in-app purchases on games and wrote, \"F*** any game company that puts in-app purchases on kids games!!!\", Us magazine reports. Expressing his frustration, the 'Gold Digger' hit-maker wrote another tweet, \"That makes no sense!!! We give the iPad to our child and every 5 minutes there's a new purchase!!!\" According to the sources, the rant was sparked by the rapper's two-year-old daughter North racking up some charges while playing games on an iPad. It is said that the app, which is free to download, offers players an option of purchasing items that will help them to move faster and more successfully through the game.(ANI) Â»", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T06:21:32.981+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
