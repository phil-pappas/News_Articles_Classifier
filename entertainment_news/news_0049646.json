Says the film's director Sakthivel Perumalsamy, \"It is widely believed that motion capture animation involves huge cost and takes too much time. I just wanted to break this myth. The opening scene in the film involves a huge battle and I cannot afford a budget to go for hundreds of actors. So, I decided to do it this way.\"\nTalking about how he cut cost, he says, \"We have used only open source software to animate the visuals. This costs only one-third of what it usually costs for animation done abroad, even though the visuals are in 3D. And instead of making the actors act out the scenes, we took stills of them and gave movement to their figures. The only drawback is that the output will be in 2K (and not the standard 4K) resolution, but that is quite good when you see it on the big screen.\"\nRealworks Studios, an animation studio in Coimbatore, which had earlier released the viral animated trailer, Ranadheeran, last year, worked on this sequence. \"An 18-member team worked on this film for two months non-stop. We wanted to show filmmakers here that one need not go abroad for such works and can get it done indigenously from our own state,\" signs off Sakthivel.
