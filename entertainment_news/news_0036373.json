According to Variety, Canada is so far the only territory to have secured the rights to stream the highly-anticipated sci-fi, action movie. The site goes on to say that in the U.S., premium cable channel Starz has an exclusive rights to Disney's 2015 titles, while Netflix has the exclusive rights to the Mouse House's 2016 titles. With \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" slated for a December 18 release, that means Starz will be the pay-TV home for the movie in the U.S. A representative for Netflix confirmed \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" is scheduled to come to the service in Canada, under the terms of the deal, approximately eight months after the film leaves theaters. During Netflix's third-quarter 2015 earnings call last week, Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said the network was in negotiations with Disney about the possibility of licensing past \"Star Wars\" movies. Ted shared, \"It's up to Disney how they want to manage access to those assets before, during or after the release of 'Star Wars VII.' So it's certainly an ongoing discussion.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:07:48.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
