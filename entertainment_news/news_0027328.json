Show Caption Previous Next \nPHOENIX - LATINA Style, the magazine centralized on empowering Latina women in the U.S., will conclude their 17th Annual Latina Style Business Series Tour in Phoenix with the honoring of Arizona Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Vice President Monica Villalobos. \nVillalobos is the founding principal of ResearchBYDesign, a research firm that works with clients to develop category-specific studies for marketing, and will be receiving the LATINA Style Entrepreneur of the Year award. Villalobos works in several Hispanic publications including DATOS: State of Arizona’s Hispanic Market. \n“I’m humbled to be selected as LATINA Style’s Entrepreneur of the Year,” Villalobos said. “In Arizona 54 percent of the 123,000 Hispanic-owned businesses belong to Latinas. I am proud to be one of them, and part of a nationwide trend that’s helping to make the U.S. economy strong again.” \nThe award honors women in all fields based off of their vision, leadership, financial success, community service and visibility as a role model. \nThe tour ends on Thursday, Oct. 22 at the Phoenix Marriot Mesa Hotel & Conventional Center from 7:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. This Latina entrepreneur program marks its 121st stop where participants can come out to network, learn about owning a business and sit in on career building seminars designed for Latina professionals. \nCopyright 2015 Scripps Media, Inc.
