October 4, 2015 Last updated: Sunday, October 4, 2015, 1:21 AM By Robert Feldberg Buy this photo Protests targeted a troupe for not using Asian actors in a production of \"The Mikado.\" \nWith no permanent home, and, like most small theater companies, perpetually struggling with financing, it nonetheless has presented short runs of meticulously staged shows, accompanied by a large orchestra. \nEach season, it schedules at least one of the Big Three — \"HMS Pinafore,\" \"The Pirates of Penzance\" or \"The Mikado\" — the most popular of Gilbert and Sullivan's works, and the ones most likely to fill the house. \nThe company's commitment to tradition, cherished by Gilbert and Sullivan aficionados, was suddenly disrupted last month, when NYGASP was yanked into the modern-world issues of racial identity and pride. Protests bubbled up on the Internet that the company's upcoming production of \"The Mikado,\" scheduled as a holiday-season event, was racist. \nThe company subsequently canceled the presentation, replacing it with \"Pirates,\" which will run at NYU's Skirball Center from Dec. 26 to Jan. 2. \n\"NYGASP never intended to give offense,\" said executive director David Wannen in a statement. \nNot that anyone thought it did. What happened was a head-on collision of clashing agendas. \n\"The Mikado,\" written in 1885, was intended to satirize English Victorian society by placing its foibles in an exotic, comic-opera Japan, where people had fanciful names like Nanki-Poo and Yum-Yum. \nIt might have played with stereotypes, but it was not, in 19th-century terms, disrespectful toward Japan. \nThe protest against the NYGASP production centered not so much on the material as on the presentation, with a cast of largely white actors, wearing yellowface makeup. Why not hire under-employed Asian-American performers? \nOffense resulting from the use of yellowface is understandable. Certainly, no theater company would have white actors playing black characters with an application of blackface. (In an interesting coincidence, the Metropolitan Opera broke with a long opera tradition by presenting its season-opening \"Otello\" without the title character in darkening makeup.) \nNYGASP's initial response to the protests was to say it would eliminate the yellowface, before it decided to cancel the production. \nLast year, there was a similar outcry in Washington State, against a production of \"The Mikado\" by the Seattle Gilbert and Sullivan Society, a community-theater troupe. In that case, the show went on. Perhaps in response to that event, NYGASP, earlier this year, posted on its website a preemptive defense of its work, titled \" 'The Mikado' in the 21st Century.\" \nIt defended its upcoming production as a traditional yet sensitive version of an operetta that was pretty respectful to begin with. \nOf the overwhelmingly white cast, it said: \"NYGASP is a true repertory company ... members make up the cast of every play that the company produces. There is no separate casting for parts in specific plays.\" (The company is also doing \"Iolanthe\" and \"Princess Ida\" in the 2015-16 season.) \n\"NYGASP cast members are G&S specialists who must be able to play Japanese villagers in 'The Mikado' one day, British sailors in 'HMS Pinafore' the next day and Venetians in 'The Gondoliers' the day after that.\" \nIt was an argument that did not carry the day. \nLooking forward, the company said, \"We are eager to focus on the challenge of creating a production [of \"The Mikado\"] that is imaginative, smart, loyal to Gilbert and Sullivan's beautiful words, music, and story, and that eliminates elements of performance practice that many find offensive.\" \nThe result will be eagerly awaited. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T11:20:45.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
