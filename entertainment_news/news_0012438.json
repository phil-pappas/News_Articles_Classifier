She plays a blood guzzling countess. Picture: FX \nLADY Gaga is just 29-years-old but says her years in the limelight make her feel elderly. \n“I have been in the business since I was 15, and although I have been famous for only seven years and lived 29, I feel like I have lived 100 years,” she told news.com.au, smiling. “And I feel f**king old.” \nThe showbiz veteran admitted she used these feelings to portray a 100-year-old blood-guzzling creature, The Countess, in her acting debut on the fifth series of American Horror Story. \nAlthough this is her first ever onscreen performance, the larger-than-life star has a reputation for transforming herself into different characters. \n“I studied method acting for almost ten years. I studied [Lee] Strasberg, the version that makes people roll their eyes.” She laughs, acknowledging the possible pretentiousness of her statement. “Arguably, it’s the most dangerous form of acting, where you embrace becoming the character and you embrace calling upon memory sensory from your life. It’s powerful and it takes you back implicitly to a place that you remember as a child. It’s very strong.” \nNot only using her emotional experiences, the Grammy award winner said she tried to physically transform herself into her character each day.
