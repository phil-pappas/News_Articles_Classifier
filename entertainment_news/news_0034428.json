By lunchtime Wednesday, the Moreland City Council graffiti team had asked Sunshine to remove the mural, which depicts naked people performing sexual acts between two halves of a sesame seed bun.\n\"When they came in yesterday I was happy to work with council to resolve it, I did not want it removed, I said I'd get Maka back in to make everybody happy,\" says Mr Sunshine.\nAfter discussions, the council decided not to remove the artwork, and will be consulting with Mr Sunshine and Makatron next week to talk about potential modifications to the mural.\nAdvertisement Mr Sunshine says he gives artists free range on the walls surrounding the building, which has become a destination for Melbourne street art.\n\"When Maka started painting it I said it was looking a little full on, he said, just wait 'til it's finished, once you've got the tomatoes and cheese and lettuce in there the naughty parts will be covered up a bit,\" he says.\n\"I've never had more mixed reactions to a piece.\"\nThe mural is a commentary on the way sex is used to sell everything, even food, says the artist.\n\"It's also about how the media treat men and women like meat,\" says Mr Sunshine.\n\"But there are subliminal messages in there as well, there are condoms at the bottom promoting safe sex. And there's a real diversity of people in the mural, so it's promoting multiculturalism as well.\"\n\"And let's face it, this town has a fascination with burgers, it's ridiculous.\"\nMakatron said he found the reaction to the mural \"pretty funny.\"\nAsked how he might modify the mural, he said he would \"maybe add some more pixelated areas, maybe add some more lettuce.\"\nMr Sunshine says he knew the mural would be controversial, but not to the level it had been.\n\"I don't want to offend anyone, I do this for everyone, not to shock or offend people,\" he says.\n\"It's free entertainment and it's for people to look at amazing murals.\"\nMoreland mayor Meghan Hopper said that Moreland City Council's street cleansing team had a policy to remove any art deemed obscene or offensive. \n\"Certainly as a councillor I'm not big on censorship and I think that all art is subjective but in this case I think the work blurs some public suitability lines on what could be considered offensive,\" she said.\n\"So fortunately the owner and artist have agreed it's suitable to make some edits while keeping the mural on site.\"\nAnother of Makatron's burger murals can be found on Smith Street, Collingwood. Called the McDeath Burger, the filling includes a skull, cigarette butts and the Australian flag.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T08:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:44:18.327+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
