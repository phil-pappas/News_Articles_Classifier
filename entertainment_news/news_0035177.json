Boaz, a wife and mother of three, has completed her new book “Deadly Secret”: a gripping and potent murder mystery novel, full of dark twists and danger.\nWhen asked about her inspiration for the book, Boaz stated “I have always thought about writing – my husband is the person who encouraged me to follow my passion.”\nPublished by New York City-based Page Publishing, Kathleen L.

But when well-known artist and respected psychiatrist, Tabitha King is murdered in an upscale neighborhood; her death has everyone asking the same question: Are they dealing with more than one killer?\nDakota is drawn into the serial killers web of deceit, and whispering secrets of a forgotten past.

She learns that her mother is harboring a dark secret from thirty years past that puts the two of them directly in the path of the serial killer.
