On Tuesday, Brown, 26, tweeted that he's interested in visiting Australia to raise awareness for domestic abuse.\nI would be more than grateful to come to Australia to raise awareness about domestic violence.Im not the pink elephant in the room anymore\n— Chris Brown (@chrisbrown) September 29, 2015 My life mistakes should be a wake up call for everyone. Showing the world that mistakes don't define you. Trying to prevent spousal abuse\n— Chris Brown (@chrisbrown) September 29, 2015 The youth don't listen to parents nor do they listen to PSA's. The power that we have as Entertainers can change lives.\n— Chris Brown (@chrisbrown) September 29, 2015 Activists have protested against Brown's tour of Sydney, Melbourne and Perth because of his attack on then-girlfriend, Rihanna -- just before the 2009 Grammy Awards. Brown pleaded guilty to felony assault and was freed from probation this year. In March, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge James R. Brandlin said Brown had completed his sentence, which included community service, counseling and rehab.\nAustralia isn't the only place where Brown has faced entry issues. Other areas that have refused him visas in the past include the U.K., Canada and New Zealand.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/chrisbrown/status/648842362253279232", "https://twitter.com/chrisbrown/status/648841918961442816", "https://twitter.com/chrisbrown/status/648842776386273280"], "published": "2015-09-29T19:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:16:18.334+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
