But when the sun goes down and the electricity sparks across the Cheekwood grounds, hundreds of thousands of tiny lights reveal themselves. \nIn the color garden, there are crepe myrtles wrapped in green and white. Sculptural trees sparkle in pinks, purples and whites. Arches display an array of orange and red. A cluster of candy-cane trees illuminate the way. \nEventually, the ponds will reflect spindle trees on the water decorated in cool whites and aqua blues, and the dogwoods will dangle 6-foot stars that look like flowers. \nRight now it's a work-in-progress, but on Nov. 27 Cheekwood Botanical Garden and Museum of Art will debut its inaugural Holiday Lights . The winter garden stroll will feature 750,000 lights, with 9-foot-tall glowing lady's slipper orchids and windflowers and blue bells and illuminated displays that cascade from the ceiling like snowfall. In addition to the twinkling bulbs, there will be live reindeer, s'mores pits, holiday carolers, and cash bars stocked with wine, beer and hot chocolate — all along a 1-mile walking trail. \nIt's all part of Cheekwood's vision to create one of Nashville's only light displays were visitors can walk through the glowing wonderland. Tickets go on sale Thursday. \n\"This will be something new and different,\" says Patrick Larkin , Cheekwood's senior vice president of gardens and facilities. \"A multisensory activity for the entire family.\" Buy Photo \nRalph Battle directs Bryan Shackleford and Rodney Morris as they install over 750,000 lights around Cheekwood.

To make room for more visitors, Cheekwood will not put up the other elaborately decorated holiday trees traditionally displayed throughout the mansion. \nLight instillation for this new array began in mid-August. Right now, alongside the pumpkins and scarecrows of the fall harvest, the display creates a holiday collision. But anticipation mounts for what's to come. \nEach day this fall a small crew from Illuminating Design has harnessed itself to branches with ropes. The men work from the roots to the canopy, winding 100-light strings around and around. They climb ladders and then up through the jungle gym of limbs, going out at far as the branch can bear before then turning around and winding the lights back down the tree in a crisscross manner. \nOn a 70-foot tree outside the front of the mansion it takes three men four hours to wrap 20,000 lights the color of warm white. With such a commitment, this extensive project that won't be complete until just before Thanksgiving. \nAs certain trees have been donned, they have also been given nicknames. There's \"Barney\" (a purple beauty) and \"Flash\" (an eye-catching red). \n\"The Hulk\" holds the honor of being Cheekwood CEO Jane MacLeod's favorite. The tree, which glows green and grows along the walking path not far from the visitor's center, was the first to be wrapped. MacLeod kept calling for more and more lights. When eventually lit, it looked brilliant, but the crew pointed out that if all the trees were covered in that many lights they would need to purchase a few million more. \nThe strategy changed for the others, but \"The Hulk\" remains with its extra-bright sheen. \n\"It will be fantastic,\" Larkin says. \nReach Jessica Bliss at 615-259-8253 and on Twitter @jlbliss .
