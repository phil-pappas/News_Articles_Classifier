The Hoodoo Gurus will headline “a day on the green” at Josef Chromy Wines on March 14. Picture: Supplied / Dave Faulkner Source: Supplied \nTHREE much-loved and hugely influential rock bands are teaming up for the very first time, headlining a huge outdoor show in Launceston next March. \nHoodoo Gurus, Sunnyboys and Violent Femmes are set to play “a day on the green” shows at vineyards across Australia, including one at Launceston’s Josef Chromy Wines. \nAll three groups formed in the early ’80s and went on to play important roles in the rise of indie-rock, with their respective debut albums — Stoneage Romeos (1984), Sunnyboys (1981) and Violent Femmes (1983) — all considered classics. \nThe classic line-up of Sydney band Died Pretty — best-known for their acclaimed 1991 album Doughboy Hollow — is also getting back together for the first time in seven years for the tour, which is rounded out by early ’90s favourites Ratcat, whose single Don’t Go Now and debut album Blind Love both topped the ARIA charts in 1991.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:52:30.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
