And she has autism. \nThe iconic children's program announced Wednesday that Sesame Workshop , the non-profit arm behind the TV series, has created the \"Sesame Street and Autism: See Amazing in All Children\" Initiative, a character and website dedicated to educating the youth about the effects of autism. The site includes a storybook featuring tales about Julia and others along with photos and videos for children, ages 2 to 5. The site also educates parents and caregivers. \nThe long-running program said it created this initiative to foster understanding of those living with autism spectrum disorder. \n\"The lack of understanding around the condition contributes to discrimination, verbal abuse, even physical violence,\" the website reads. \"A recent study reveals that children with autism are five times more likely to be bullied than their peers -- treatment no child should endure.\" \nAccording to People , Julia's stories detail how children with autism may play with children differently. \"If you're five years old, and see another kid not making eye contact with you, you may think that child doesn't want to play with you. But that's not the case,\" Sherrie Westin, executive vice president of global impacts and philanthropy, told the magazine. \"We want to create greater awareness and empathy.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:09:48.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
