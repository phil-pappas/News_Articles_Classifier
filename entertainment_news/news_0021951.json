So which shows or personalities are popular broadcasters like Kyle and Jackie O and Kate Ritchie a huge fan of? News.com.au found out: \nKate Ritchie from Nova’s Kate, Tim and Marty: \n“I’m not really a radio listener. But I do love Jonesy and Amanda because for my husband’s 30th birthday I organised for them to call him and do let him do the quiz in the morning and he won a blower for the backyard. The yard looks fantastic, so thanks to them.” \nKyle Sandilands from KIIS FM’s Kyle and Jackie O show: \n“I don’t really listen to anyone else to tell you the truth. I have heard Hughesy and Kate and I think they’re excellent. I even thought they were good on Nova ... silly Nova to let them go. I also like the drive show on Nova, whatever their names are.” (FYI Kyle, it’s Kate, Tim and Marty).
