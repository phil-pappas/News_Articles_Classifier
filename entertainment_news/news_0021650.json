The colours relate to which Bond actor visited the country first. \nHere are a few facts about some of the locations that have turned up on Bond’s MI6 expenses forms. \n1. Don’t trust a name! Sean Connery never went to Russia in From Russia With Love. In fact it took until 1985 for Roger Moore to first visit the Soviet Union. \n2. Two outright fictitious “countries” are visited by Bond, both in the Caribbean. They are San Monique (Dr Kananga’s island location in Live And Let Die) and the Republic of Isthmus (which sounds a lot like Panama to us) in Licence To Kill. \n3. Roger Moore is the only Bond to have reached outer space, taking a shuttle to Hugo Drax’s space station in Moonraker. \n4. Bond has NEVER been to mainland sub-Saharan Africa. \n5. Likewise, Australasia has been a Bond-free zone since the franchise began. \n6. Other countries you might have expected a super-spy like Bond to have visited but are missing from the list include Poland, Ireland, Israel, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Belgium, Canada and any of Scandinavia.

Moore’s Bond visited 17 different countries (not including his time outside Earth’s atmosphere). \n8. In From Russia With Love, Sean Connery’s Bond is seen travelling on the Orient Express from Istanbul to Italy. We assume he travelled through the modern countries of Bulgaria, Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia, although we’ve not marked this on the map. \n9. Connery and Moore visited Hong Kong and Macau respectively. But at the time they were territories of the UK and Portugal. Therefore Bond’s first true trip to China came in Skyfall with Daniel Craig’s trip to Shanghai. Brits in Shanghai – a fairly recent phenomenon apparently (Stefan Rousseau/PA) \n10. Bond’s most visited country is the USA, which he has been to in seven films (often to multiple locations). His second most visited country is Italy, which he’s visited in six films. Share article \n11. In total, Bond has visited seven US states: Florida, Maryland, Kentucky, California, Nevada, New York, and Louisiana.
