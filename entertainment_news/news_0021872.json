(Photo: Cellarmen’s) \nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Over the summer we told you about Cellarmen’s, a new craft cidery coming to Hazel Park.\nThe interior work on the 12,000-square-foot building is finished, permits are in place, and Cellarmen’s is set to open to the public Saturday.\nCellarmen’s will be open noon-midnight Saturday. For the time being the pub, at 24310 John R in Hazel Park, will be open Fridays to Sundays. If you’re familiar with the area, it’s just a skip away from James Rigato’s new spot, Mabel Gray. (See Molly Abraham’s review.)\nCellarmen’s, which is Hazel Park’s first microbrewery, cidery and meadery, isn’t the only shop in the mead-making game. For nearly a decade B. Nektar has been crafting fermented honey beverages at 1511 Jarvis in Ferndale, not far from Cellarmen’s.\nYou can complete the southern Oakland County mead trifecta with a stop into Schramm’s Mead. Opened two years ago in downtown Ferndale at 327 W. Nine, Schramm’s serves blackberry, raspberry, ginger and other flavors of mead to-go or to sip in-house.\nBurgers, shakes; less guilt \nAlso opening this week, Brome Burgers & Shakes is offering fast food with less guilt. Debuting to the public at 6 p.m. Friday, the Dearborn restaurant boasts burgers made with organic, grass-fed beef and other ethically sourced organic food.\nBrome, occupying a 3,700-square-foot space at 22064 Michigan, is the brainchild of owner Sam Abbas.\nThe menu features a variety of hamburgers, ranging around $10. Brome also has five salads, hand-spun shakes, hot dogs, a kids menu and sides like garlic and cilantro French fries. After Friday, it’ll be open daily 11 a.m.-10 p.m.\nHuron Room to open soon \nFrom the folks behind Johnny Noodle King and Green Dot Stables comes Huron Room, a casual restaurant in southwest Detroit.\nThe Huron Room will have a focus on fish from the Great Lakes and a full bar with many local labels.\nFind it at 2547 Bagley, next to Our/Detroit vodka and not far from Mexican Village Restaurant. Look for the big freshwater fish sticking out of the building’s white brick exterior.\nLast week, the restaurant put out a call for employment applications via social media, which could be a sign that the new spot will be opening soon..\nmbaetens@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/melodybaetens \n\nFood & beverage events \nSkarbie Dinner at Yemans Street: Area chefs Jason Osburn, Brandon O’Sullivan and Ricky McCormick present a modern spin on classic Polish food.
