The streaming video service is reportedly in talks for a limited-series revival with creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and her husband and executive producer, Daniel Palladino. Sources say the revival will consist of four 90-minute episodes or mini-movies. [ TV Line ] \nDying Alone in New York City \nEach year a number of people who die in New York, have no obvious next of kin. They die forgotten and alone, a fear many New Yorkers share. A New York Times article this week took a closer look at the death of George Bell, a 72-year-old man whose body was found in his Jackson Heights one-bedroom apartment last July. It took investigators more than three months to sort out his affairs. [ NYT ] \nQuantity Over Quality in the Affordable Housing Market \nCan affordable housing look nice? In the history of low-income housing in New York, quantity has tended to come before quality. But as the mayor sets his agenda around providing more below-market-rate housing, urban planners are looking at how to combine affordability and aesthetics. This piece in New York magazine looks at the Hunters Point South project in The Bronx as a case study. [ NY Magazine ] \nAccidental Gun Deaths of Children, Visualized \nIt’s hard to conceptualize the fact that 110 children are accidentally killed by guns every year in America, according to recent estimates. But in this piece by Vox, the stories behind that number become a little clearer. The site broke down the total by gender, age and who shot the gun, according to a recent study of 229 cases over seven years in 16 states, and includes small anecdotes about how the accident happened. Put together, the data gives a much fuller — and more depressing — picture of the statistic. [ Vox ] \nBaltimore Still Struggles \nSix months after riots tore apart Baltimore in the aftermath of Freddie Gray’s death, the city remains in turmoil. Murder rates are soaring, leadership is tenuous, all while the city braces for the trial of six police officers implicated in 25-year-old Gray’s death. It’s strife in a city that’s long suffered from racial divides, poverty and crime — but now, residents say, things seem on the “brink,” though it remains unclear if Baltimore is on its way to a “breakthrough or a breakdown.” [ NYT ] \nHow You Can Find Out Whether or Not Joe Biden Will Run for President \nJoe Biden's plans regarding the upcoming presidential election have been a huge source of speculation for months, showing up everywhere from Maureen Dowd columns to \" The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. \" In the wake of so much guesswork, Molly Ball at The Atlantic has managed to put together a fairly definitive strategy for determining whether or not the vice president will run. It may seem simple, but it should be more or less foolproof. [ The Atlantic ] \nThe Modern Chinese Burger is Gray? \nGray is typically not the first color that comes to mind when it comes to burgers, but it might soon be in China, where McDonald’s has rolled out a gray bun for its newly released “Modern Chinese Burger.” The gray bun is a steamed mantou bun, popular in China, and holds a pork patty, bacon, lettuce and Sichuan Thousand Island dressing. While Westerners have registered their distaste, a fair number of Weibo users (China’s most popular social media site) are calling it a hit, Mashable reports. But gray burger lovers only have until Nov. 3 to grab one; McDonald’s hasn’t decided if it will have a longer rollout.
