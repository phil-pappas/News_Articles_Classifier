Clown. Unicorn.\"Her son Bodhi looks insanely cute while clutching his toy and posing for his mama! He has exact same eyes as his mother. \nIn August the 30 years old actress filed for divorce from her husband of five years . She has 2 sons with Brian Austin. Her elder son is 3 year old and the younger one's 20 months. \nThis is the first picture of Bodhi she's shared since January. We shouldn't be surprised to know that this picture gained a lot attention. \nMegan first introduced her son Bodhi on television when he was only three months old on 'The Ellen DeGeneres Show' in 2014.'Bodhi' is the little chubby one and then Noah is the one with the lips,' Fox explained. \nMegan and Brian started dating in 2004, at the time she was 18 and he was 30. He had made a guest appearance on her sitcom 'Hope and Faith'. \nThe couple got engaged in 2006 and tied knots in 2010. Reports say that the couple had a lot of issues within the marriage, nothing specific has been disclosed though. \nThe couple continue to remain friends and co-parents of their children. In a 2013 interview, Megan told Marie Claire UK, \"I believe he's my soul mate, but that doesn't mean it doesn't take work, because we are very, very different.\" \nMaybe that statement quite explains why the marriage didn't work too well for the duo. However, we hope Megan posts more images of her children and doesn't go aloof from the social media like she did once for 23 weeks!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T13:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:47:48.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
