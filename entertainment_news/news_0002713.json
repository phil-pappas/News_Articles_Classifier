Last month, a car hit a bank on Joseph Avenue, and someone drove into the waiting room of a Penfield doctor's office. The month before that, there was a car into an apartment building in Gates.\nBack in July, a crash sent a vehicle into Jim's Stop & Shop near Ames and Jay streets — the third time the building got into a car crash — a pickup crashed through the front window of the College Town Barnes & Noble, someone hit the Chili Tim Horton's, and someone else hit the Spencerport CountryMax. In June, it was a car into a house on St. Paul Street. In May, an alleged drunken driver hit a building at Lake and Ravine avenues. In the pre-dawn hours one April morning, a car smashed into the Central Park Café.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nCar crashes into porch of city home\nIt's hard to know if we crash into more stationary buildings around these parts than folks do elsewhere. It sure seems so. The problem is proving it. We checked with the DMV in Albany. They don't keep track. We checked with the Rochester Police Department. No luck there, either, unless we wanted to sort through every accident report (police budget records estimate that officers respond to an average of 8,750 motor vehicle accidents each year).\nSo let's just say we slam into our fair share. Is that the sort of thing you should expect your homeowners or car insurance to cover? Yes — to both.\nShould you find yourself the unfortunate property owner with a vehicle sticking out of your structure, you'd be well-served to put a claim in to your own insurance company to start, said Jackie Ortiz, a City Council member who also owns her own State Farm insurance agency.\n\"Impact by vehicle is definitely covered,\" she said, recounting having worked through such matters with a customer homeowner in Honeoye Falls who had a vehicle hit their front porch. \"It is one of the many perils.\"\nNew York state mandates that motorists carry a minimum $10,000 in property damage liability coverage. That goes for other cars, or houses, as it happens.\nSometimes that's enough. Sometimes it isn't even close.\nTake Lyjha Wilton, whose Boulder Coffee at Alexander and South Clinton was struck by five vehicles in four separate incidents the first three years it was open.\nBuy Photo A crew cleans up after a truck crashed into Boulder Coffee on South Clinton Avenue and Alexander Street in 2006. (Photo: MAX SCHULTE/@maxrocphoto/staff photographer)\nThe first was the worst. A pickup plowed through the building's northwest corner roughly a year after the café opened. The crash occurred in July 2006, and repairs stretched into and through the winter.\n\"It was a crash course in learning how to deal with a catastrophic situation as a landlord and business owner,\" he said.\nThe repairs totaled in the neighborhood of $120,000 to $150,000, and were covered by his insurance, which then pursued the driver. Wilton hired a third-party adjuster \"to make sure I was getting the money I was owed. They take a percentage … but they really helped.\"\nHe keeps a picture of that crash in his office. Two others, including one that sent both vehicles through the front door and window, also caused significant damage. Others were more cosmetic, and handled by the offending drivers' car insurance.\nStill, large and numerous claims follow you, driving up your rates — which Wilton said has cost him as he also is a landlord with 150 units in the area. Wilton also had two of his residential rental properties hit by cars during that time.\nLooking back, Wilton is only half-joking as he notes the upside of the chaos for Boulder.\n\"More people started recognizing the name,\" he said, as the repeated crashes kept his budding business in the headlines and top of mind: \"Oh yeah, that's the place that gets hit by cars.\"\nAfter that spate of crashes, the city put in a median and, Wilton noted: \"Cars running into my properties have slowed down dramatically.\"\nAll the same, he said, sidewalk seating has never really been an option he considered. The repairs, however, did force some forward-thinking remodeling.\n\"We opened it up,\" he said, \"made (the front corner) all glass, so you could see the cars coming — in case you had to run.\"\nBrian Sharp is the economics/sports watchdog reporter and contributes to the Watchdog blog.
