In an interview with HitFix, the creative team behind the show gives the blunt reason why it's not going to happen. \"I think the reason why Superman's not in the show is because it's not about him,\" says executive producer Sarah Shechter, \"And it's her show and it's about her and he is just sort of a shadow in the back of her psyche, and I think that's the right way to portray him because that's how she experiences it.\" Still, Superman will be addressed on the CBS series. Asked which version of Superman they refer to on the show, EP Andrew Kreisberg answers, \"It' not specifically the Christopher Reeve tie in to the universe. It's not the Christopher Reeve version. It's not the Henry Cavill version. It's a version of Superman and what he has gone through in the world that we live in and the things that he's faced and what's happened to him vis-a-vis how it reflects on Kara is all our invention.\" \"Supergirl\" stars Melissa Benoist as Superman's cousin Kara Zor-El, who also lands on Earth after escaping Krypton. She's been hiding the powers she shares with Superman, but later decides to embrace her superhuman abilities and be the hero she was always meant to be. Also starring Peter Facinelli as Maxwell Lord, Calista Flockhart as Kara's boss Cat Grant, Chyler Leigh as Kara's foster sister Alex Danvers, Mehcad Brooks as Kara's love interest Jimmy Olsen and Jenna Dewan -Tatum as Lucy Lane, the show is set to debut Monday, October 26 at 8:30 P.M. on CBS. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:18:54.921+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
