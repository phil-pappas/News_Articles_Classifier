The sketch is the central piece in an exhibition dedicated to Brancusi in the city of Timisoara.\nThe brass-clad sculpture was built to honor Romanian heroes of World War I. It survived communist attempts to pull it down in the 1950s.\nThe 1937 sketch was donated by the daughter of the engineer who helped Brancusi with the technical aspects of the 30-meter sculpture.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:23:19.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
