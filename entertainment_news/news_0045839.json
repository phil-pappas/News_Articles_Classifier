Not at all. That's fine. I'm over it at the moment. All I want to do is move on,\" Craig said in the interview which was posted on Time Out's website this week.\nThe magazine says the interview was conducted in July, just after filming on the 24th Bond film was completed.\nCraig said that living up to the image Bond has to project is onerous, and he had put everything into the latest one.\n\"Every idea I’ve had for a Bond movie, I’ve stuck into this one. It’s gone in. The Bond bank is dry. If you’re asking me what would I do with another Bond movie? I haven’t a clue. Go into space? Let’s do it! They already did it. Let’s do it again.\"\n\"Spectre\" will be released in Britain and Ireland on Oct. 26 and in the rest of the world in early November.\n(Reporting by Michael Roddy; Editing by Louise Ireland )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T13:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:23:12.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
