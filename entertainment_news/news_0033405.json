That’s 2% higher than in 2013, when The Hunger Games: Catching Fire and Iron Man 3 helped set the current record.\nHowever, Morgan Stanley suggests that profits will fall in 2016, despite the planned release of reliable franchise money-makers such as Captain America: Civil War and Zack Snyder’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.\nStar Wars: The Force Awakens – watch the new trailer\n2015 has proved a bumper year for two studios in particular: Disney, which owns Marvel , and Universal. Universal had an exceptional year, with a string of surprisingly good domestic results for Pitch Perfect 2 ($183m to date), Minions ($334m) and Straight Outta Compton ($160m), each of which topped the US box office in their opening weekends. Jurassic World, a reboot of the franchise that began with Michael Crichton and Steven Spielberg’s Jurassic Park, took a record-breaking $500m in its opening weekend, with $204.6m of that coming from the US.\nDisney’s books were bolstered by the Avengers sequel, which has taken $459m, and the Pixar animation Inside Out ($354 million).\nMorgan Stanley predicted in June that Star Wars: The Force Awakens will make $1bn in profit after its worldwide release in December. Disney bought the rights to the Star Wars universe for $4.05bn in 2012.\nThis article was written by Henry Barnes, for theguardian.com on Friday 16th October 2015 15.54 Europe/London guardian.co.uk © Guardian News and Media Limited 2010", "external_links": ["http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/04/16/150416starwars_FromGAus/150416starwars_FromGAus.m3u8", "http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/16/1429210905270/Still-from-Star-Wars--002.jpg", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/4658593/04-noNetworks-noAdsense-mpu&sz=300x250&t=vertical%3Dhome&mob=js&c=", "http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/16/1429210903049/Still-from-Star-Wars--001.jpg", "http://gu.com/p/47tba", "http://gu.com/p/4dc2p", "http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/03/01/poweredbyguardian.png", "http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/04/16/150416starwars_FromGAus-16x9.mp4", "http://variety.com/2015/film/news/2016-box-office-down-2015-record-1201619066/", "http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/30/disney-lucasfilm-star-wars-deal", "http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/04/16/150416starwars_FromGAus.webm", "http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2015/apr/16/star-wars-the-force-awakens-video", "http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/04/16/150416starwars_FromGAus_3gpSml16x9.3gp", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/4658593/04-noNetworks-noAdsense-mpu&sz=300x250&t=vertical%3Dhome&mob=js&c=", "http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/04/16/150416starwars_FromGAus_3gpLg16x9.3gp", "http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:17:26.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
