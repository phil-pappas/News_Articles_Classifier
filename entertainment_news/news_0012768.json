Cosby has denied the allegations.\n\"Baylor University is working to confront the scourge of interpersonal and sexual violence wherever it occurs,\" the school said in a statement. Baylor's Board of Regents made the decision on Thursday to rescind the doctor of humane letters.\nThe university, which prides itself on providing a Christian education, awarded the degree in 2003 when it was facing a crisis after one of the school's men basketball players was arrested for murdering a teammate.\nAfter that, the men's team was rocked with charges of violating NCAA rules.\nIn September 2003 Cosby donned the university's colors and put on a free performance for about 20,000 people in which he dispensed advice on dealing with loss that was peppered with jokes.\nTroubles have returned to the school in the central Texas city of Waco this year when a Baylor football player was sentenced by a Texas judge in August to six months in jail and 10 years probation for sexually assaulting another student in 2013.\nThe school has faced criticism for trying to play down the incident and has started an independent investigation of how it managed the incident.\n(Reporting by Jon Herskovitz; Additional rpeorting by Jim Forsyth in San Antonio; Editing by Bill Trott )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:19:06.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
