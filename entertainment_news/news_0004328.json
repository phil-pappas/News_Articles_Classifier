By NATHAN DEEN In a brief apology during a press conference yesterday, Florida quarterback Will Grier expressed his remorse for taking an over-the-counter substance that resulted in a failed performance-enhancing drug test and a one-year suspension from competition.\n“I really hope that people can learn from this, learn from (my) mistake,” Grier told the media.\nAt the very least, it was the first subject discussed Tuesday after Georgia Southern’s practice near the banks of Eagle Creek. Coach Willie Fritz gathered his players around him and reminded them of the serious consequences that can come from an avoidable mistake. Fritz told his players to check with the Eagles’ training staff about anything they put into their bodies.\nThe NCAA conducted performance-enhancing drug tests on 19 GSU players Tuesday morning, Fritz said. It’s an issue that frequently worries him.\n“We talk to our guys about that all the time,” he said. “They’ve got to be aware of it. You make a split-second decision, and you hear about someone’s taking this or that. I don’t know the specifics of the case, but I watched (Grier) apologize on TV, and he seemed very remorseful. You don’t just affect yourself. He affected the whole team, families, coaches, all the fans.”\nFritz said he has to make sure there’s a good relationship between the players and training staff, which is headed by Brandy Clouse, the GSU associate athletic director for sports medicine.\n“(Clouse) does a fantastic job,” he said. “They come and ask her about things. She’s really good.”\nGetting back to work\nFritz put a priority on using Georgia Southern’s bye week to get players rested and healthy. The Eagles took Oct. 6 and 7 off, had shortened practices on Wednesday and Thursday, then were given a three-day weekend before getting back on the practice field Monday.\n“Hopefully we used it to our advantage,” Fritz said. “We lifted more than we normally do. We didn’t practice quite as long. It’s not very often you get three full days off.”\nBut there wasn’t much trouble getting focused on New Mexico State for Saturday’s homecoming game.\n“That’s the worst part about an off week: you’ve got to wait to get back onto the field,” senior safety Matt Dobson said. “Everybody is locked in. We’ve got a conference opponent. We’re ready to go.”\nAnd that’s the job of seniors like Dobson and linebacker Antwione Williams: making sure everyone is on the same page.\n“As an older player, you relish your off time, but you just get back into it,” Williams said. “It might be a little bit harder for the younger guys, but it’s our job to pull toward the same goal that we all have. As soon as Monday started, we got back into the grind of things like we didn’t miss a beat.”\nBall hawks\nDefensively, the Eagles have been sound all season and have made strides in the secondary since giving up a handful of big plays in the season opener against West Virginia. The main focus was sharpening their tackling technique and emphasizing turnovers. Georgia Southern has forced 10 interceptions this season, which is tied with BYU for fifth in the nation. Four of them have been made by safety Antonio Glover, which is sixth-best among FBS defensive players.\n“We’ve been successful so far, and we’ve got to keep that up,” Dobson said. “Creating turnovers is huge. That’s why we’ve been successful to this point.”\nReceivers need to step up\nOn the offensive side, wide receiver Ryan Longoria said he and the GSU receiving corps must to step up to bolster the passing game, in spite of losing top receiver BJ Williams for the season due to injury.\nFritz has mentioned almost on a weekly basis his concern for developing a respectable passing attack, but the Eagles haven’t quite clicked, though their running game has been more than good enough to win games. But the coach said there were at least 100 yards of offense that were left on the field in the Eagles’ road win against Louisiana Monroe.\n“We had five or six plays against ULM that we either dropped or weren’t accurate or we botched protection,” Fritz said. “We want to throw the ball better. We worked on that this week.”\nLongoria said it’s been on the receivers to make things easier for quarterbacks Kevin Ellison and Favian Upshaw.\n“We need to run the routes all the same so we can give the QBs better timing, so we’re not all running routes differently and doing whatever we want,” Longoria said.\n“Guys need to step up. We have the ability for the passing game to work. Guys just need to step up and start making plays.”\nSouthern is running the ball at an FBS-best 377.4 yards per game but is next-to-last in passing offense at just 62.4 yards per game. Longoria said he believes the offense will click as long as the Eagles keep working at it.\n“We’ve been showing flashes here and there,” he said. “I believe as the season goes on, we’ll step it up.”", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-13T17:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:19:17.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
