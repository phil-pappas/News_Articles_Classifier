It got to the point where I couldn't have a conversation with someone.'' \nAnd the 'Worth It' hitmaker admits it hit her ''like a ton of bricks'' and would be scared to look in the mirror. \nShe added to PEOPLE magazine: ''I think that we have all had our fair share of experiences with acne but for me, I actually never had acne until the first time we went on tour and it hit me like a ton of bricks. \n''It was just all over my face and I just remember waking up and looking in the mirror and literally being afraid to look in the mirror because I would just cry. I didn't want to go on stage.'' Contactmusic", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T14:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:35:08.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
