Dumaplin\nOctober 8, 2015 Bryan del Rosario, one of several hopefuls wooing Pastillas Girl (real name Angelica Jane Yap), doesn’t agree with critics who have been lambasting “It’s Showtime” for supposedly “pimping” the latter.\nThe issue was raised by Gabriela after supposedly receiving several complaints about it.\nBryan del Rosario\n“I don’t see it as a ‘bugaw’ serye,” said del Rosario in an interview. “(May) consent naman (niya), and she’s already of legal age.”\nHe pointed out that Angelica’s parents have been very supportive of the concept of the show, and they even accompany Angelica to the set of “It’s Showtime.”\n“Marami lang talagang naiinggit,” he said. “Hindi naman ito ’yung first time na may dating game (ang mga shows), marami ng dating game (noon), so bakit ngayon lang sinabi ’yang mga ganyan?”\nHIS MESSAGE TO THE CRITICS?\n“May sari-sarili naman tayong trip eh. Basta don’t take it seriously, and it’s better if you see the good in something ’di ba? Para at least mag-e-enjoy ka rin,” he said.\nTo Angelica’s online bashers, Bryan said, “Let’s be fair. Stop bashing kasi it’s not helping you.”\nHe added, “Siguro kayo din naman nagmumura, nagkakamali at nagkakagusto (sa isang tao), ’di ba? All of us have negative sides… ’di porket si Angel (Angelica) nasa TV at binubuksan ’yung sarili sa publiko, eh siya na lang ’yung may mali. Let’s not be hypocrites.”\nMTRCB announced via Twitter on Oct. 5 that they’ve already invited producers of “It’s Showtime” to “appear before its GAD (Gender and Development) Committee on Oct. 13 to discuss the issue.\nBRYSTILLAS (BRYAN + PASTILLAS GIRL)\nBryan did not expect to be chosen as one of the suitors of Ms. Pastillas. He believes he has a big chance in capturing Angelica’s heart though, thanks to the huge number of votes he has been receiving from netizens. He is determined to win, describing her as “matalino” and “malakas ang dating.”\nShould he and Angelica get into a relationship, the 23-year-old wouldn’t mind sharing their love story with the public.\nJoshua Bulot, Bryan and Kim Lawrenz Ordonio\n“Kasi for me, ’pag may girlfriend ka, gusto mong ipagsigawan sa lahat na gusto mo siya,” Bryan explained.\nAsked what he likes most about Angelica, he said, “Nakukuha niya talaga ’yung interes ko kasi nung nakilala ko siya behind the camera, nakita ko na sobrang nakakatuwa talaga siyang babae.”\nBryan made his intentions clear. “Ang pinaka-purpose ko for her is to defend and protect her. And eventually, I’ll bring out the best in her.”\nHe believes his edge over competitors is his musical prowess. Bryan is a member of boy band JBK and has been performing with them for years now.\nGiven the chance, he would like Angelica to listen to one of his compositions titled “Letting You Go” explaining she could relate to its message of “acceptance and moving on.”\n“Since she came from a great heartbreak din, gusto ko i-share sa kanya ’yung song na ’yun kasi it helped me move on din. Kailangan niya lang mag-let go du’n sa nararamdaman niya.”\nALBUM OUT SOON\nAside from Bryan, the boy band JBK counts Joshua Bulot and Kim Lawrenz Ordonio as members. They were one of the three winners of the 2014 McJim Classic Leather’s “Dreams Get Real” talent search.\nThe band will soon put out their eponymous album “JBK,” composed of 10 tracks (five original songs).\nJBK named Apo Hiking Society as their greatest influence, musically. “We’re more of fun crossover R&B. Nilalagyan na rin namin ng medyo sing-and-dance like sa mga K-pop para ’yung mga fast songs namin, nalalagyan namin ng mga dance.”\nAmong the songs on the album are their viral song “Damang Dama” and “Ano Bang Meron Ka,” “Letting You Go” and “Para Kang.” (With report from Jojo P.
