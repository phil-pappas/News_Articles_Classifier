An insider says the studio isn't happy with Diesel's post, or the notion that he might direct. “It is never going to happen,” said the insider. \nThe search for a new director for the franchise has not been easy. James Wan, who helmed “Furious 7”, chose not to return to take on the eighth installment, instead signing on to direct “Conjuring 2”. \nUniversal Pictures had no comment on Diesel's post. Sources say the script, by Chris Morgan, is still being finished up, at which point producers will look toward officially hiring a director.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T09:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:24:00.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
