He made his debut in Salim Ahamed's film, which also has his father Siddique in a prominent role.\nThe young actor, who plays Mammootty's son in the movie, talks about what attracted him to films, why he thinks the megastar is progressive and the best advice his dad gave him.\nWhat attracted you to movies? I always wanted to be part of films. Right after Class 12, when people asked me what I wanted to do, my answer was that I wanted to direct films. But after doing my Bachelors in Visual Communications in London, I realised that directing wasn't as easy as I imagined. Then I helped my dad in his business for a while. It was during this time that some of my friends and family suggested me that I try my hand at acting. They told me there was a particular time frame for me to get into acting and once that window of opportunity closes, it's gone. That prompted me to take up acting classes under the tutelage of NK Sajeev in Kochi. Later I enrolled in Anupam Kher's classes in Mumbai.\nYour dad must have warned you about the pitfalls of being in the film industry... He told me that I had to be presentable all the time (laughs). My dressing style is quite casual. He also said that I have to behave in the best manner possible and should respect everyone on the set even if I knew them well. One of the best advice he gave me was that I should love myself. He told me that 'there is nothing wrong about you and there is nothing good about you either. Whoever you are, be happy and confident about it. Only then people will love you.'\nYou earlier said you first met Mammootty on the set of Vatsalyam. Did he give any advice when you decided to enter films? I call him Moothappa because he is like my father's elder brother. Four years ago, I approached Moothappa seeking advice as part of my studies. I asked him if it was necessary to do a masters related to films from abroad to be part of the Malayalam movie industry. He told me that it was a brilliant idea. He explained that people don't usually think of formal film education when starting out in our industry and that's been happening for too long. A course abroad would teach me new methods of filmmaking and that I can use them to our industry. He said, it would be a way of giving back to cinema. I was amazed by his words. His thoughts are so progressive. He loves the industry and wants to see it evolve all the time.\nMany star kids are foraying in to the industry. Is it easier for an actor's son? For me, definitely! I consider it a blessing. My father had to go through a lot of struggles to get into the industry; he survived and has been part of it for a long time. Now a lot of people love him. I am blessed I can be here because of that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T14:39:12.834+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
