Now that’s something worth celebrating. The pretzel has a fascinating history. There are many stories in oral tradition as to where the pretzel got it’s name. My favorite is that it comes from the Italian, “pretiola,” which means, little rewards. The story goes, that monks in Northern Italy baked these little breads as special treats for children who had learned their prayers properly. The shape is said to represent the crossed arms of a child in prayer. It is also said that it comes from the German for “a small bake,” or “bracelet.”\nWe’ll let the etymologists go on with their academic pedantry while we just get on with the important business of baking and eating the tasty pretzel. Pretzels belong to a family of breads that are poached in water before baking to give them their characteristic chewy dense and chewy texture.\nThe pretzel is quite old, some culinary historians believing it is as early as the 7th or 8th century, where it was being produced by monks. By the middle ages it was well established. The pretzel was the symbol of the bakers guild in many countries and in fact, you couldn’t become a master in the baker’s guild until you could make a perfect pretzel.\nNow, all that may be fascinating but the proof of a pretzel is in the eating so let’s get on to a pretzel recipe, and what’s better with a pretzel than good mustard? What could be even better? Well, some fine nut brown ale of course. If you don’t make your own try a brew from some of our fine premium and botique breweries like, Anchor Brewing Co. in San Francisco, Lagunitas in Petaluma, Sierra Nevada in Chico, The Hopmonk in Sebastopol or The Stump Town Brewery in Guerneville.", "external_links": ["http://www.anchorbrewing.com/beer/anchor_steam", "http://www.thequestingfeast.com/MustardRecipes.html", "http://www.hopmonk.com/", "http://www.sierranevada.com/", "http://www.stumptown.com/", "http://www.lagunitas.com/", "http://www.thequestingfeast.com/recipes/i-p/Soft_Pretzels.html"], "published": "2015-10-18T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:24:54.613+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
