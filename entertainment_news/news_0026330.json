De ATLEY / STAFF WRITER\nPublished: Oct. 10, 2015 7:29 p.m. CORONA: Highway 91 projects have seen trouble before Print Photo Share Pin It 1 of 9 More Galleries ADVERTISEMENT A portion of a railroad bridge lies across the eastbound lanes of Highway 91 in Riverside on Sunday, May 18, 2014, following an accident that killed a construction worker who was involved in the demolition of the Pachappa Railroad Overcrossing. , DAVID BAUMAN, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Related article » The weekend work halt on Highway 91 in Corona after nine workers were injured affects one of two projects to improve traffic flow on critical stretches of one of Southern California’s most overwhelmed freeways.\nA section of widened roadway being lowered into place Friday night, Oct. 9., fell from about 16 inches and slammed into wooden support beams, injuring the workers – three of them critically.\nWith regular slowdowns and crowding – westbound for Orange and Los Angeles counties in the morning commute, eastbound back to the Inland area for the evening – the SR-91 Project that was affected by Riverside County Transportation Commission executive director Anne Mayer’s weekend “safety stand-down” is designed to dampen what Inland commuters call the “Corona crawl.”\nScheduled for completion in 2017, the $1.4 billion project will extend two tolled express lanes in both directions on Highway 91, from the Orange/Riverside counties border through Corona to Interstate 15.\nIt will also add one regular lane in both directions from the Interstate 15/Highway 91 interchange east to Pierce Street in Riverside, and improve five local interchanges, as well as the Interstate 15/Highway 91 interchange.\nBut the SR-91 Project that began in July 2014 has not gotten as many headlines as the separate $248 million SR-91 HOV Project that starts about five miles east of Pierce Street.\nThat project will add high-occupancy vehicle lanes in both directions between Adams Street in Riverside and the interchange for highways 60 and 91 and Interstate 215. Started in March 2012, it is slated for completion in December.\nAmong the incidents for the SR-91 HOV Project:\nJesse Silva of Azusa, a contract worker for Caltrans, was struck Jan. 14, 2013, by a car driven by a Moreno Valley man, Enrique Lopez Lopez , who later pleaded guilty to driving-under-the-influence charges in the felony hit and run. Silva was setting out cones to close westbound lanes past the 14th Street offramp in central Riverside on Highway 91 in preparation for overnight construction when he was hit. Prosecutors at the time of the case said Silva was left in a coma and a vegetative state. Lopez was sentenced to more than six years in prison.\nA fire on Aug. 23, 2013, destroyed the wooden forms and rubber molds used to press Riverside’s raincross design into the cement of a retaining wall along the Central Avenue eastbound offramp from Highway 91 as part of the widening project. The fire also spread to a construction crane. There were no injuries. The fire and damage was estimated to delay that portion of the project by weeks.\nFreeway worker Okesene Faasalele, 59, of Long Beach died early May 18, 2014, as he worked to remove the Pachappa Railroad Crossing over a closed Highway 91 near 14th Street. A section of the bridge collapsed onto empty eastbound lanes. Faasalele, tethered to the structure by a safety harness, was catapulted onto the pavement. The accident resulted in more than $100,000 in fines to construction companies because of safety violations. The fined companies said at the time they would appeal.\nContact the writer: rdeatley@pe.com or 951-368-9573", "external_links": ["http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw1b0y-b88537286z.120151010192948000g0lcgue1.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw1b10-b88537286z.120151010192948000g0lcgud8.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw1b0z-b88537286z.120151010192948000g0lcgudn.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw1b11-b88537286z.120151010192948000g22cguhr.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw1b11-b88537286z.120151010192948000g22cguhr.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw1b10-b88537286z.120151010192948000g0lcgud8.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw1b11-b88537286z.120151010192948000g22cguhp.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw1b11-b88537286z.120151010192948000g22cguhp.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw1b0z-b88537286z.120151010192948000g0lcgudg.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw1b0z-b88537286z.120151010192948000g0lcgudc.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw1b0y-b88537286z.120151010192948000g0lcgue4.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw1b0z-b88537286z.120151010192948000g0lcgudc.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw1b0z-b88537286z.120151010192948000g0lcgudn.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw1b0y-b88537286z.120151010192948000g0lcgue1.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw1b0y-b88537286z.120151010192948000g0lcgue4.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw1b10-b88537286z.120151010192948000g0lcgud6.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw1b10-b88537286z.120151010192948000g0lcgud6.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw1b0z-b88537286z.120151010192948000g0lcgudg.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:23:17.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
