She is accused of scheming to defraud the bankruptcy court by concealing income she earned between 2012 and 2013, by creating bank accounts to hide it.\n\"Miller knowingly concealed ... a substantial amount of business income which she earned from her appearances as a featured performer on the reality television program 'Dance Moms,' and related spin-off TV programs, as well as income she earned from Masterclass dance events and online merchandise sales from Abby Lee Dance Company.com,\" the indictment said.\n\"Dance Moms\" on the Lifetime television network, currently in its fifth season, exposes the lives of competitive young dancers, including the tensions between their parents and Miller. She is currently filming a sixth season, said her lawyer, Robert Ridge of Pittsburgh.\nSome of the fraudulent activity came to light after a bankruptcy judge, channel surfing one night, spotted some of the related shows and raised questions about Miller's claim to be cash-strapped, the indictment said.\n\"I realized there is a lot of money coming into this plan, this case and it hasn't been disclosed,\" the indictment Quote: d the judge as saying at a court hearing in 2013.\nInvestigators also found emails from Miller to her accountant and a joint venture partner in 2013 with the subject line \"LETS MAKE MONEY AND KEEP ME OUT OF JAIL,\" admonishing them to \"not raise any red flags\" and \"DON'T PUT CASH IN THE BANK!!!,\" according to the indictment.\nMiller's lawyer said in a statement his client entered bankruptcy to save her business and \"has paid all of her creditors 100 cents on the dollar. There is no loss to any of her creditors.\"\n(Reporting by Barbara Goldberg in New York; Editing by Mohammad Zargham and Frances Kerry )\nAbby Lee Miller of the show ''Dance Moms'' arrives at the Teen Choice Awards 2014 in Los Angeles, California August 10, 2014.
