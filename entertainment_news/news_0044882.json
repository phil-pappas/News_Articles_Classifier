She and Bublé were together three years, and split following rumors the singer had been unfaithful.\n\"We had a good time, I still love his family,\" she qualified before addressing the cheating reports. \"I don't know, it's complicated. Now I'm going red! I never talk about it. I never want to talk about it.\"\nWord of Bublé's reported infidelity broke in November 2007 after a woman shared photos of the singer naked in her bed. He and Blunt split the next summer, and he later told eTalk, \"I was a jerk and I was careless and reckless with the hearts of women I was with.\"\nBlunt went on to marry John Krasinski in July 2010, and welcomed her first child, daughter Hazel, with the American actor in February 2014. Bublé wed Luisana Lopilato in March 2011, and shares 2-year-old son Noah with the Argentine actress.
