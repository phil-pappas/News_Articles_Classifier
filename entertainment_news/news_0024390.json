Worse, some said they have been unable to purchase food or important items for their families.\nThe problems with the RushCard started October 12, when a software upgrade in the transaction processing system caused many RushCard accounts to show a zero balance or caused customers to have no access to their funds. The company says the glitch has been mostly resolved, though thousands remain affected.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
