Michelle Persad Fashion Editor, The Huffington Post Posted: 10/23/2015 07:02 AM EDT \nIt was a big week for Kim Kardashian West. Not only did the reality star turn 35, but she also co-hosted the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund Show. And of course, she did it all in style. We especially loved her sparkly skirt and top combo at the CFDA/Vogue event (this lady knows how to dress her baby bump). \nBut she wasn't the only one in her family to hit it out of the park. Kendall Jenner stole the show at the Balmain x H&M runway show , both on the catwalk and on the red carpet. \nCheck out all the other best-dressed stars of the week (they're not all Jenners or Kardashians) and let us know if you agree with our picks. Don't be afraid to show a little skin while you're pregnant. Getty Images Kim Kardashian West in Altuzarra: Pregnancy isn't slowing this lady down! In fact, her style seems to get better as her bump grows. This gold, shimmery skirt, paired with her black top and navy jacket, are true to her style, but slightly modified to accommodate her belly. OK, and Kanye looks pretty dapper, too. Chokers are here to stay. Getty Images Kendall Jenner in Balmain x H&M: We're not sure what we love most: her necklace, her blazer or those amazing pants. The good news? We don't have to choose, because all of it is affordable. A culotte jumpsuit is all you need. Getty Images Sienna Miller in Celine: Long sleeves, wide-leg pants and a high neckline don't exactly spell sexy, but somehow Miller managed to make this culotte jumpsuit look fashion-forward and, dare we say it, a little sultry. The nipped-in waist and leather sleeves add just the right amount of sexiness to this ensemble. Separates can look just as great as a dress. Getty Images Zoe Salanda in Calvin Klein: The way Saldana contrasted this lady-like, high-waisted skirt with a slightly oversized long sleeve shirt is a study in how to create perfect balance in an outfit. Bravo! Statement heels can work with a statement dress. Getty Images Naomie Harris in Dior: We can't take all the stylish and amazing looks Harris has been giving us over the past few weeks . This little Dior number looks incredible. Between the shift shape, the colors and her killer statement heels, we want to rip it off her and wear it ourselves. Too much is never enough. Getty Images Cate Blancett in Schiaparelli: If you described this dress, sight unseen, it would sound like a lot. Velvet, floral, sequins -- but somehow, all the elements work together harmoniously. The short sleeves and plunging neckline offer a bit of skin to break up the busy dress, and the solid black skirt helps to cleanse the palette when taking in the entire look. It's all in the details. Getty Images Diane Kruger in Michael Kors: This vibrant blue hue is so pretty on the German actress (and such a nice change from the neutral hues we normally see her in). The criss-cross tie detail at her waist along with the high slit add a little bit of flair to this otherwise traditional dress. Yellow can make all the difference. Getty Images Allison Williams in Altuzarra: Now this is a color we don't often see (especially in such large amounts). Had Williams worn this look in black, it would not have been nearly as special, but this bright hue really pops against her skin. And we love her choice to go for nude heels -- this ensemble is loud enough without statement footwear. \nAlso on HuffPost: Our Favorite Looks Of 2015 of", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T14:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:44:36.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
