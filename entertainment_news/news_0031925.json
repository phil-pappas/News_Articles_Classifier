Suspicion points to Caroline Goldacre, Clare’s overwrought assistant — or was Caroline, as she herself insists, the target of the crime? \nThe villain, and some truly dark plot turns, get sorted out all in good time; along the way, we experience the true pleasure of George’s books — spending time with a group of likable (well, most of them) colleagues, about whom we’ve come to care. Unlike in many long-running mystery series, George’s characters grow and change; sometimes gradually, sometimes (as in “With No One As Witness,” in which Lynley’s beloved wife, Helen, was suddenly murdered mid-book) in an instant. \nAuthor appearance Elizabeth George The author of “A Banquet of Consequences” will appear at 7 p.m. Tuesday Oct. 27 at Third Place Books in Lake Forest Park; free (206-366-3333 or thirdplacebooks.com ).\nIn “A Banquet of Consequences,” 18 months since Helen’s death, Lynley is slowly making his way into a new relationship with Daidre, the veterinarian we met in “Careless in Red.” Havers, who aroused boss Isabelle Ardery’s fury after going rogue on an international case (“Just One Evil Act”), is on her best behavior in order to avoid the horrors — the reader must take this on faith — of being transferred to Berwick-upon-Tweed. It’s unlikely, of course, that Barbara can toe the line for long. Meanwhile, the impeccably dressed department secretary, Dorothea, has decided that Sergeant Havers (who kicks off the plot in a T-shirt that reads “On the eighth day God created bacon”) is in need of a makeover — and perhaps a tango class as well? \nMost Read Stories Seattle principal losing his job over unfinished teacher evaluations Seattle Seahawks' Kam Chancellor takes to Twitter to protest fine from NFL 5 ways CaliBurger is better than In-N-Out Seattle Mariners manager Scott Servais may not be a sexy hire, but is he the right one?

While George, a Seattle-area resident, doesn’t vary the rhythms of her books much — they’re all long, dialogue-heavy and pleasantly crowded — she excels at creating and developing her characters, revealing just enough to leave readers happy yet yearning for more. Among the highlights here: Havers and DS Winston Nkata becoming chummy temporary housemates in Dorset (she decides, fairly disastrously, to cook him dinner); the tricky, volatile chemistry between Lynley and his ex-lover Isabelle; a companionable cameo appearance from Lynley’s longtime friend Simon St. James; the presence of an undeniably charming dog; and a number of irresistible Britishisms, most of them uttered by Havers. \nAnd, as always, the relationship between Lynley and Havers takes central stage. Though no longer partners, and physically separated for much of the book, their complex, endearing relationship — he wants her to succeed but is infuriated by her stubbornness; she wants his respect but chafes at his rule-following — takes hold of the novel. It’s essentially the same tension between them that’s existed since the first book, written more than a quarter-century ago — and it’s still, miraculously, irresistible. \nMoira Macdonald is the movie critic for The Seattle Times.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T16:38:14.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
