Sailors in Victorian times had a reputation for being ‘light on their feet’ whilst the ladies at sea would certainly have needed to be tough to survive – and our casting reflects this.” Share article \nThe show runs nightly from Tuesday to Friday at Hanger Farm Arts Centre in Totton . \nCall 023 8066 7683 for tickets.
