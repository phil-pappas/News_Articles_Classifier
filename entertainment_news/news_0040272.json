Nearly every child has heard the famous poem that Christopher Columbus sailed the ocean blue in 1492.\nBut with more people aware that several explorers reached the Americas before Columbus — there are several rhymes in protest of the famed explorer.\nHere are five hip hop songs that throw shade towards Christopher Columbus:\n1. Jay Z featuring Frank Ocean — \"Oceans\" ADRIAN SANCHEZ-GONZALEZ/AFP/Getty Images Jay Z released \"Oceans\" in 2013 where he made it clear that he was a fan of rapper Christopher Wallace and not Christopher Columbus. When rapper Jay Z released the Grammy Award-winning song \"Oceans\" in 2013, he made it clear he was no fan of the Columbus tale.\nThe Brooklyn native celebrates how far he has come and proves he knows his history when he raps the lyrics: \"Can he be more cleaner/the oil spill that BP cant clean up/I'm anti Santa Maria/only Christopher we acknowledge is Wallace.\"\nThe last line is an homage to the late rapper, Biggie Smalls, whose real name was Christopher Wallace.\n2. Lupe Fiasco — \"Around My Way (Freedom Ain't Free)\" Don Arnold/WireImage Lupe Fiasco has never been quiet about voicing his opinions on current issues. Chicago rapper Lupe Fiasco is known for his controversial views on politics and current events.\nFiasco used his hit song \"Around My Way (Freedom Ain't Free)\" to diss the controversial holiday when he said \"hope and pray they take Columbus Day up off the calendar.\"\nThe 2012 track was nominated for a 2012 BET Hip Hop Award for best impact track.\n3. Wyclef Jean — \"If I Was President\" Hagen, Kevin Freelance NYDN/Freelance, NYDN Hip hop icon Wyclef Jean released his hit song \"If I Was President\" before President Barack Obama won the 2008 presidential election. Wyclef Jean wanted people to stop lying in his 2008 song, \"If I Was President.\"\nThe ex-Fugees leader touched on several historic moments that he feels are flawed with lies — including Christopher Columbus' discovery with the lyrics, \"tell the children the truth, the truth/Christopher Columbus didn't discover America.\"\nThe politically-charged song was released shortly before President Barack Obama's historic presidential win.\n4. B.o.B featuring Charles Hamilton & Asher Roth — \"Change Gonna Come\" Hannah Mattix/for New York Daily News B.o.B. released a song from his mixtake \"B.o.B vs. Bobby Ray\" to give his opinion on Christopher Columbus. In 2008, rapper B.o.B hooked up with fellow hip hop newcomers Asher Roth and Charles Hamilton to release \"Change Gonna Come.\"\nSampling the classic Sam Cooke song, \"A Change Is Gonna Come,\" Roth rapped that he felt Americans are vain when it comes to their accomplishments by saying, \"We've been pompous ever since Columbus couldn't work a compass.\"\nThe song was featured on B.o.B's mixtape \"B.o.B vs. Bobby Ray.\"\n5. Nas — \"Ancient People\" PETER FOLEY/EPA Rapper Nas' collaborative album with Damien Marley gave a voice to the people in Africa - donating proceeeds from the album to help build schools. Nas went back in time with the track \"Ancient People\" on his collaborative album \"Distant Relatives\" with reggae artist Damien Marley.\nThe lyrics, \"before Columbus was lost in travel, ancient canoes got paddled,\" paint a picture of what it was like before the explorer discovered America.\nProceeds from the 2010 album went to a project in Africa to build schools in Congo.\nsburt@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories Nas awarded with prestigious medal at Harvard University Eats Beat: Aziz Ansari seen at Estela, Nas at Hennessy event Jay Z, Beyonce, others suing Paris retailer Jay Z, Beyoncé renting $45 million mansion is Los Angeles Beyoncé, Jay Z to headline Tidal charity concert Tags: lists , news break , jay z , frank ocean , lupe fiasco , nas", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/jSxvVQRjuEg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/pcCsY9CX3BY", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/9pq_3OheqzU", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/S77zUWqawag", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lj8URbXgW_I"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:50:13.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
