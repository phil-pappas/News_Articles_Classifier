The 46,500-square-foot theater will offer patrons food and drinks served at their seats during the movie.\n\"The concept is really about enjoying a wide selection of options from the menu, plus everything from a full bar, all with service right at your seat,\" said Danny DiGiacomo , the company's marketing director.\nFuture patrons could conceivably take in the next installment of the Hannibal Lecter series with some fava beans and a nice Chianti, or order a martini, shaken not stirred, to go with the latest Bond flick.\nHow does this whole Movie Tavern thing work?

You'll have to carry the food and drink in to the theater yourself, however.\nFans of arthouse and independent films can already bring food and alcoholic drinks into the theater at Frank Banko Alehouse Cinemas at ArtsQuest Center at Steelstacks in South Bethlehem.\nOther upgrades to the South Whitehall AMC theater include new plush recliners, 3D screens, sound systems and lighting in every theater, along with a new box office near the entrance. All the improvements should be complete in 3 to 4 weeks, according to project manager John Allison.\n\"This is a definite trend,\" Allison said of the bar addition. \"Pretty much every theater is going this way.\"\nMOVIE TAVERN / HANDOUT Movie Tavern, which is coming to Trexlertown in 2016, is a \"combination of going out to eat in a casual dining setting and moviegoing all wrapped up into one,\" says Danny DiGiacomo, the company's marketing director. \"The concept is really about enjoying a wide selection of options from the menu, plus everything from a full bar, all with the service right at your seat.\"\nMovie Tavern, which is coming to Trexlertown in 2016, is a \"combination of going out to eat in a casual dining setting and moviegoing all wrapped up into one,\" says Danny DiGiacomo, the company's marketing director. \"The concept is really about enjoying a wide selection of options from the menu, plus everything from a full bar, all with the service right at your seat.\"\n(MOVIE TAVERN / HANDOUT) To cope with a decade-long decline in U.S. movie theater attendance, cinema chains are adding a range of \"premium offerings\" that include posh seating, high-end audio and video and food and alcoholic beverage service, according to a 2014 Cinema Operator Industry Sector Review by the New York-based Redwood Capital Group.\nConcessions are particularly lucrative for theaters, typically carrying a profit margin of 80 to 85 percent, according the report, compared to a 45 to 50 percent margin for admissions.\n\"Theaters are trying to find a way to reverse the attendance declines,\" said Leo Kulp, an industry analyst with RBC Capital Markets. \"What they have found is these premium offerings, reclining seats, expanded menus, alcoholic beverages are bringing people back into the theaters.\"\nThe new services and upscale amenities have been particularly helpful with older patrons, who have more disposable income, Kulp said.\nThe growing, privately held Movie Tavern chain has two other theaters in Pennsylvania, located in Flourtown and Collegeville, both in Montgomery County. A third is scheduled to open later this year in Exton, Chester County.\n\"I think what's different with us is we have been doing this since 2001 and we have now 15 years of experience to consider as we grow and change our execution,\" DiGiacomo said. \"This is what we do.\"\nJaindl initially proposed the development in 2004. Construction has been delayed by the recession and the plans have been revised multiple times since. In June, the developer approached Lower Macungie officials to seek construction of a traffic roundabout near the site to support the project.\nIn an interview Tuesday, developer David Jaindl said the roundabout won't be a part of the plan for the retail development after all because Pennsylvania Department of Transportation officials have expressed their preference for a traffic light at the site.\nMovie Tavern seemed like the perfect fit, in part because its customers will come and go at different times than patrons of neighboring businesses, easing traffic concerns.\n\"There is nothing like them in the Valley,\" Jaindl said. \"When they came to us, we introduced this site to them. We felt they would be good match for a project like this because of their uniqueness.\"\nMovie Tavern will be an anchor of sorts, Jaindl said, but the development will be made up of stand-alone buildings, not in-line retail. Each site will be sold as a condominium.\nJaindl said he expects to submit formal land development plans to Lower Macungie Township officials in the next 30 days.\nJaindl said the retail center will span 32,000 square feet, in addition to the theater.\nscott.kraus@mcall.com\nTwitter @skraus\n610-820-6745\nMovie Tavern\n• Headquarters : Dallas\n• Location : Hamilton Boulevard, Lower Macungie Township, next to Walmart.\n• Opening : late 2016\n• Food and beverage : Casual dining menu, full bar with wine, beer and signature cocktails\n• Theater : 11 screens, state-of-the-art sound, digital projection and 3D capability\n• Amenities : Reserved stadium seating, call button service in all theaters\n• Specials : \"Breakfast and a Flick\" series on weekends geared to families, retro series featuring classic films.\nSource: Movie Tavern.", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56280006/turbine/mc-extra-how-movie-tavern-works-20151021", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56280254/turbine/theater-jpg-20151021"], "published": "2015-10-22T01:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:04:48.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
