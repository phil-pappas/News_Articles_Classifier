Hello Matthew Goode— Samantha McKittrick (@samckittrick) October 11, 2015Matthew Goode in Downton. Him and Branson. You're spoiling me— Draculaura (@LauraEms_) October 11, 2015There was some rather scandalous talk about a *ahem* gearstick:Mary needs more than a handsome smile and a hand on the gearstick. #DowntonAbbey— The Dowager Countess (@theLadyGrantham) October 11, 2015Ooer! Gear stick innuendo! #DowntonAbbey— Sarah Wyatt (@seahorsegrl) October 11, 2015\" Mary needs more than a handsome smile and a hand on the gear stick\" Don't we all? #DowntonAbbey— Judy Reith (@parentingpeople) October 11, 2015Oh dear, was that a double entendre from the Dowager Countess? Gearstick, indeed #DowntonAbbey— Michelle Birkby (@michelleeb) October 11, 2015And while some fans took the opportunity to speculate on which characters may not survive the series:Will Lord Grantham die soon? Not only an ulcer? #DowntonAbbey— Claudia Schmidt (@foolforfood_de) October 11, 2015Lord Grantham's health is a constant worry this season.
