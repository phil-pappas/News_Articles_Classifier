He's up against bessie mate Taylor Swift for Artist of The Year; they're also pitted together in the Best Pop/Rock Album category and Best Adult Contemporary. In addition to this, he's up for Song Of The Year (for Thinking Out Loud - although he faces fierce competition from the likes of Uptown Funk, I Can't Feel My Face, and - yes Taylor Swift's - Blank Space) and Favorite Male Artist: Pop/Rock.\nSwift has six nominations in total, while Nicki Minaj has four (don't mention the war) alongside Sam Smith. Nary a mention of Hozier, which is a bit bizarre. We love Hozier, we do.\nJennifer Lopez will host the ceremony, which will be televised by ABC, live from Los Angeles' Microsoft Theater on Nov. 22nd.\nThere's a smattering of the main nomination categories below.\nArtist of the Year\nSam Smith\nTaylor Swift\nMeghan Trainor\nThe Weeknd\nOne Direction\nLuke Bryan\nAriana Grande\nMaroon 5\nNicki Minaj\nEd Sheeran\nSong of the Year\nSee You Again - Wiz Khalifa ft.
