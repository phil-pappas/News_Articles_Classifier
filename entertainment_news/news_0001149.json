The Seed Project is an interactive performance installation that uses the removal of seeds from watermelon as visual metaphor for cultural erasure, the seeding of new identity and a future world.\nBrooklyn, NY, October 23, 2015 --( PR.com )-- Installation created by award-winning artist, writer and director Nehprii Amenii continues through October 31 at Brooklyn’s R. A. M Gallery\nThere’s still time to see “The Seed Project,” an extraordinary multi-media exhibition of imagery, words and sound, as its run at Brooklyn’s R. A. Gallery and Art Café has been extended through October 31.\nMore than an exhibit, in fact, “The Seed Project” is an installation that’s an interactive experience, a story that unfolds on three levels accessing the eyes, the mind and the ears.\nSays award-winning artist, writer and director Nehprii Amenii, the creative force behind this captivating project, “I want the visual beauty to be the lure, for the words to stimulate wonder and for the sounds to make the listener feel me. They all go together. I am the unifying thread. Exhibits are usually only appreciated by looking—this is much, much more. It’s a very personal statement dealing with my own struggle and cultural sensitivity.”\nIn the installation, Amenii uses the removal of seeds from watermelon as a metaphor for the cultural erasure of being an African born in America—what’s been called “African American” or “black.” As she puts it, “a crippling science experiment gone as wrong for us as Frankenstein…a crisis.” There’s a need, she says, to go beyond the social constructs of what’s been created called race.\nOriginally developed as a solo performance work, half of the room is a watermelon patch and the other half is a futuristic post-apocalyptic world of broken vinyl. Between the two is the sea with one single hanging ship, created by Hip Tic Lab.\nSprinkled throughout the soundscape, created in collaboration with Eben Mannes, are the words and inspiration of James Baldwin, Octavia Butler, and Amiri Baraka; the visual aesthetics inspiration of Jee Young Lee; and the integrated gallery performance work of Theaster Gates.\nThe interactive installation has won considerable praise. Filmmaker Mike Fallek said, “I was drawn in because it’s so beautiful. And then when I listened I covered my mouth and gasped. Most black art is just for black people. But this is different. It welcomes anyone in and then allows them to feel what is being expressed.”\nAs a theatre artist Amenii has a passion for both puppetry and grand-scale spectacle. She creates experiences that dismantle the wall between players and audiences aiming to enchant the imagination and inspire new ways of seeing and thinking.\nShe adds, “In most exhibits, the art is the thing that gets looked at from a distance. For this exhibit, the art is the world that has been created for you to step into.”\nFor more information about Nehprii Amenii’s work please visit: www.nehpriiamenii.com.\nAbout Nehprii Amenii\nFounder and artistic director of Khunum Productions, Nehprii Amenii has worked with numerous theatrical companies including Alvin Ailey Dance Foundation and Cirque du Soleil.\nIn 2010 she received a grant from Downtown Brooklyn Partnership to create an exhibit and Community Arts Center based on her children’s book “Memories of the Little Elephant.” In 2011 she was sponsored by the International Rotary Club to create a story-telling exhibit in South East India.
