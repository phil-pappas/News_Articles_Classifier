Lakers player, who remains in a \"critical condition\" in the Intensive Care Unit of the Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas, is reportedly likely to have suffered \"brain damage\" as a result of a \"loss of oxygen but also possible stroke,\" and doctors are treating the situation as a non-suicidal \"overdose.\" \nA source told E! News : \"Drugs were found in his system. \n\"He had been partying since Friday. He was doing crack cocaine all weekend and he choked on his mucous. They're now having to fix all the damage it has done. \n\"Virtually every drug imaginable was found in his system.\" \n'There's likely brain damage' \nLamar remains unconscious and on a ventilator, and appears to have suffered an \"ischemic stroke,\" caused by a blood clot preventing blood flow to the brain. \nThe insider added: \"So, likely there's brain damage, but they're not sure how much.\" \nBrothel owner Dennis Hof previously insisted none of his staff saw Lamar, 35, take illicit drugs during his stay, but admitted he was seen taking herbal substitutes for Viagra. \n\"The police looked through his things and they didn't tell us they found anything. The girls that were hanging out with him didn't see any use of any illegal drugs at all. \n\"We heard, from my people, like eight or 10 herbal Viagra pills. \n\"I've seen guys take one pill and have a real good time so it sounds like a lot to me.\" \n' KUWTK is not filming' \nMeanwhile, Lamar's ex-wife Khlo√© Kardashian, who filed for divorce from the athlete in December 2013 following months of rumours he was addicted to crack cocaine and cheating on her, is \"devastated\" after rushing to be by his bedside. \nAnother source told gossip website TMZ that cameras are not rolling for her family's E! reality series, Keeping Up with the Kardashians , and they have also banned any photography inside the hospital.
