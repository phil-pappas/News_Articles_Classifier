He’s co-headlining a tour with Vega, as he’d done previous years, starting with a pair of Freight dates on Nov. 5 and 6. And he opened for Colvin (who headlines sold-out Freight shows Nov. 18 and 19) on a tour back in 1997, including a stop just a mile away from the Freight & Salvage at the Greek Theatre .\n“That was fun,” Sheik recalls, by phone from New York City. “It was my first time playing in front of two or three thousand people every night, which was great.”\nThe 45-year-old Brown alumnus has a hit to his name, as well. “Barely Breathing” from his self-titled debut album charted for an astonishing 55 weeks from late 1996 through 1997 and was certified as the most-played song of the latter year by BMI, the music royalty, publishing and licensing company. \nCoffeehouses, clubs \nAll three musicians were unlikely hit makers whom one would have pictured playing coffeehouses and clubs rather than large theaters and even outdoor venues such as the Greek.\n“Maybe realistically, I was the least ‘coffeehouse’ of the three,” Sheik posits. When he first came onto the national music scene in the mid-’90s, he cited alternative bands such as Depeche Mode, the Cure and the Smiths as influences, as well as art rockers including Japan, Talk Talk and the Blue Nile.\n“But I certainly had the ‘white guy with an acoustic guitar and a string arrangement’ thing in my music,” he says. “There was definitely a Nick Drake / Gordon Lightfoot throwback-y element to what I was doing. So that (association) made sense.”\nAs for being part of the collective consciousness for a time (and still being heard in upscale grocery stores and Taco Bells alike), Sheik is at once philosophical, honest and humorous about the quest for and price of obtaining a broader audience.\n“Everyone wants to be on the radio. I think we should all admit that,” he says with a chuckle. “It’s just doing those big radio concerts and all that morning show promotion is a little bit jarring and, at least in me, creates some amount of cognitive dissonance.\n“Of course, I’m happy and honored to do it. But I don’t always feel exactly at home in that context. I think it’s just a case of wanting your cake and eating it, too: You want to be on the radio all the time and just live this comfortable life of luxury on the sidelines. But that’s not going to happen,” he adds, laughing.\nSheik has found an audience on the stage as well. The success in 2006 of his musical “Spring Awakening,” with lyricist and frequent creative collaborator Steven Sater , launched a parallel career as a composer.\n“That ended up being a couple years of my life,” he replies, when asked about the effect that the eight-time Tony winner had on his pursuits as a solo artist. “White Limousine,” from 2006, was his last album of non-musical-related material until “Legerdemain,” which was released Oct. 9.\nThe first half of “Legerdemain” — or Side A, as he conceptualizes it — was influenced by the synthesizer-based songs he wrote for a musical adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis ’ “American Psycho” that will receive its Broadway premiere in March. \nArt songs \nThe latter “Side B” part consists of what he’s described as art songs and serves as an unofficial follow-up to his mostly acoustic “Phantom Moon” album, which was put out on the Nonesuch label in 2001.\n“When I started working on ‘American Psycho,’ I knew I wanted that to be completely electronic. So I dove back into a lot of old (keyboard and drum machines) from when I was a teenager that I got out of the closet or bought,” he says. “And then I really got into (music sequencing, recording and performance software) Ableton much more deeply.”\nRecorded at his picturesque live-work Sneaky Studios, on 2½ acres of property in New York’s Hudson Valley, “Legerdemain” trades the chamberesque arrangements of previous albums for analog keyboards such as the original Roland Juno -106 he had in his youth.\nFor this tour, Sheik plans to perform “Legerdemain” songs as well as ones from his musicals songbook with keyboardist Jason Hart and drummer Doug Yowell .\n“We have some rehearsals coming up the end of the month, and I’m going to figure out how to make sequences a little more organic so that it’s not just playback,” he reveals. \nYoshi Kato is a freelance writer.
