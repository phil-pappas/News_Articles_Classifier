If he said no, we were in big trouble because the whole concept was built around Robin.\"\nCo-writer Ron Clements added, \"There was no one else that could be the Genie and fortunately he agreed to do it. And he worked so hard. We recorded him in four hour sessions, and he would be going four hours straight... by the end he was just drenched. He had so much energy and so much passion.\"\nAnimator Eric Goldberg said, \"Aside from being funny as anything, he was such a warm person. He was the Genie - it was bigger than life.\"\nThe Aladdin Diamond Edition Blu-ray pack will hit the stores on October 13.\nFor latest Hollywood updates follow us on Twitter >>> @TOIEntertain\nFor the latest in Hollywood news, like us on Facebook >>> TOIEntertain\nFor more interesting Hollywood news and pictures follow us on Pinterest>>> timesofindia\nFor latest Hollywood updates follow us on G+ >>> The Times of India Entertainment\nWATCH: Robin Williams Family Agrees to Settle Dispute", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TOIEntertain", "https://www.pinterest.com/timesofindia/", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107628521107103264647/+TOIEntertainment/posts", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/b8AbDHUw8jA", "https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:54:00.582+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
