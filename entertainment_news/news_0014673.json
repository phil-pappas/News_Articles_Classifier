The self-sufficient community is made up of seemingly fatherless children whose vulnerable mothers were talked into joining the tribe. \nWhile the women handle domestic chores, Gregori teaches the kids (there are perhaps 15 to 20 of them, of varying ages) such random subjects as winter gardening and shooting targets. He emphasizes strict adherence to communal rules — when one boy gives his mother butchered meat acquired from outside the compound to cook, she panics — and rewards children with karaoke nights and blue backpacks. \nMovie Review ★★   ‘ Partisan,’ with Vincent Cassel, Alex Balaganskiy, Jeremy Chabriel, Florence Mezzara. Directed by Ariel Kleiman, from a screenplay by Kleiman and Sarah Cyngler. 98 minutes. Not rated; for mature audiences. Grand Illusion, through Thursday.\nWhile these details are intriguing, they require a larger context. There Kleiman and co-screenwriter Sarah Cyngler make a tactical error in offering no rhyme or reason as to why Gregori orders the murders of certain ordinary individuals in the city. Are they connected somehow to the damaged women in the cult? Do they represent some ideological conflict for Gregori?\n  The film’s calculated vagueness is a distraction in basic storytelling terms. Much better is the rising, adversarial nature of Gregori’s relationship with two boys in his charge: one a relative newcomer (Alex Balaganskiy) who sees right through the leader’s hokum, and the other (Jeremy Chabriel) a surrogate son who feels his humanity slipping away. \nThose growing fissures in Gregori’s cult-of-personality paradise ground this incomplete fantasy in something real.\nTom Keogh: tomwkeogh@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:40:10.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
