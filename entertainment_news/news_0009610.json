The Japanese restaurant, which opened late last year on the first floor of the Four Seasons Hotel... Charleston Harbor East For nearly two decades, this Baltmore superlative has been inviting diners to sit back and enjoy the charming flavors of South Carolina’s Low Country. Chef Cindy Wolf’s native state provides the inspiration... The Food Market Hampden Three years after opening, The Food Market's bright, sparkling light has not dimmed. Chef Chad Gauss's particular brand of creative comfort food remains consistently terrific, from longtime favorites, like fried pickles with buffalo sauce and liquid gorgonzola, to season-driven specials. The food is casual enough to eat every day, but fantastic, so it's equally appropriate for special occasions... La Cuchara Woodberry Spain's Basque Country is one of the most exciting food regions in the world, so it's no surprise that La Cuchara, which offers Baltimore's first major foray into the region, is a huge success.

The dining room's gilded accents, chatty atmosphere and knowledgeable staff evoke the most romantic elements of fin-de-siecle Paris... The Prime Rib Mid-Town Belvedere The old-school glamour. The leopard-print carpet. The glossy black walls and piano. Mix this clubby decor with oysters Rockefeller, pungently dressed Caesar salad, USDA prime beef, and those irresistible Greenberg potato skins... Thames Street Oyster House Fells Point The excellent international selection of oysters, served neatly shucked and ice cold, is only one of many reasons to love this narrow Fells Point restaurant. The award-winning lobster roll is another. But the rest of the menu deserves attention, too... Woodberry Kitchen Woodberry This past May, Spike Gjerde brought home the first James Beard Award given to a Baltimore restaurant, winning the Best Chef: Mid-Atlantic honor for his work at Woodberry Kitchen, his flagship farm-to-table spot...
