Like Us on Facebook Various entertainment have also stepped up to the occasion and lined up appearances and exhibitions at the event. DC Comics is one of them, with \"Batman vs Superman\" costumes reportedly going on display a the annual event. Interestingly, LexCorp has joined the fray by offering free Wi-Fi to NYCC attendees. Fans of the Man of Steel will know that LexCorp is owned by one of the superhero's nemesis, Lex Luthor. \"A video has been released which further sells the illusion that Superman's iconic enemy is providing everyone at NYCC with free internet access,\" ScreenRant noted. \"According to the video, this year's free Wi-Fi will be provided by LexCorp's brand new operating system: Lex/OS.\" Further, IGN noted that the NYCC website itself has included a statement about the said free Wi-Fi from LexCorp. \"Free WiFi throughout the Javits Center will be provided by LexCorp Industries. LexCorp unites humanity through technology. We believe in technology as a means of communication, unification and a source of inspiration,\" the statement read. \"To access the WiFi on-site at the Javits Center, connect to the 'LexCorp' network from the list of available networks,\" it went on. \"You will automatically be redirected to the LexCorp WiFi login page where you can enter your email address and click 'CONNECT' to gain access to the network.\" \"LexCorp -- together, we can build a better world,\" it concluded. While this is obviously a marketing ploy promoting \"Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice\", which opens March 25, 2016, it decidedly is a clever one as it appears to have a foothold on reality with the Wi-Fi connection provision. However, considering Luthor is a villain, there is the question of whether he will indeed fulfill his free Wi-Fi promise. \"The video also alleges that the LexCorp booth - which is SC02 - is giving away free portable chargers,\" ScreenRant said. \"Even if the internet doesn't run smoothly, free charging devices is sure to benefit many people at the packed convention - assuming supplies aren't very limited, of course. Would you really trust something Lex gave you for free, though?\" What's your answer to this question? Comment and let us know what you think!
