Meanwhile, Hillary Rodham Clinton 's backers celebrated the day after what some said was the best two hours of her campaign. \"We were over the moon,\" said former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm , a Clinton backer who'd traveled to Las Vegas to watch the first such confrontation between the 2016 Democratic nomination contenders. On morning cable news programs, Granholm could barely contain her glee. \"It was such a great night,\" she said on MSNBC 's \"Morning Joe.\" Clinton, who spent Thursday campaigning in suburban Las Vegas, warned her backers that the contest was far from over. \"There's a lot of work to be done between now and securing the nomination which I'm going to be focused on to earn every single vote,\" she said, taking questions after an event at a union hall. Both Sanders and Clinton were looking Wednesday to build on their strong Democratic presidential debate performances as the rest of the field struggled to gain traction. Clinton, too, was trying to fundraise off her debate performance, emailing campaign backers with requests for donations from her husband, former President Bill Clinton, with the subject line \"She won.\" The debate commanded by Clinton and Sanders appeared to narrow any opening for a presidential bid by Vice President Joe Biden , Democratic strategists said. Biden watched the Tuesday matchup from Washington. \"I was proud,\" he said Wednesday during a White House meeting on infrastructure. \"I thought every one of those folks last night — my own prejudice — I thought they all did well.\" Polling for Democratic Candidates | InsideGov A day after aggressively defending her long public service record and contrasting it with that of Sanders, Clinton remained in Nevada, talking to local media in the early voting state. She picked up the endorsement of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades during an event at a training facility in suburban Las Vegas before attending a rally. \"Last night was a good night, today is just as good getting the endorsement of this union,\" she said. Sanders attended a taping of \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show,\" which has become a popular stop for presidential hopefuls. Later Wednesday, he was greeted with thunderous applause and shouts of \"Bernie, Bernie\" at a $25-a-ticket fundraiser at a Hollywood nightclub.
