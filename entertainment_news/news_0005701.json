Wearing a sexy jumpsuit and towering heels, she and her apparent new beau, 23, left separately.\nIn the midst of her reported heightening romance with the \"Chains\" singer, Hudson shared insight from he recent breakup, calling the ending \"painful.\"\n\"Relationships ending are painful, and you can choose to carry that or you can choose to reframe it,\" the Rock the Kasbah actress told Allure magazine for their November issue. \"If Matt and I had a great relationship, we would still be together, but we chose to move on because we had different visions of how we wanted to live our lives. That doesn't mean, though, that we can't rebuild something that would be the best thing for the kids.\"\nHudson and Bellamy have a four-year-old son, Bing, together and are continuing to amicably co-parent the child; Hudson also has an 11-year-old son with ex-husband Chris Robinson .\n\"[Bellamy and I] said, 'We need to try to create something for the kids where they feel like they're gaining something rather than losing something,\" Hudson explained about her most recent split. \"It's been a seamless transition...Kids just want to see their parents be cool. Everybody's cool; everybody's good.\"\nHudson, although looking for a \"consistent presence\" for her family, was first linked to Nick Jonas in September, when they were spotted riding a rollerocaster together in Orlando, Fla..
