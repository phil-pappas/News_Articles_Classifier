(Photo: Lucasfilm) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThere has been an awakening of \"racist\" outcry, as the third and final trailer of Star Wars: The Force Awakens sparked a movement to boycott the J.J. Abrams-helmed film. \nA social media movement using the hashtag #BoycottStarWarsVII, is accusing the film of pushing a multicultural agenda and engaging in \"white genocide,\" according to one of the tweets using the hashtag. #BoycottStarWarsVII because it is anti-white propaganda promoting #whitegenocide . â€” End Cultural Marxism (@genophilia) October 19, 2015 \nThe hashtag, which appeared on Twitter Sunday and Monday night, objected to the fact that none of the main protagonists are white males -- Daisy Ridley is a woman,John Boyega is black and Oscar Isaac is Guatemalan American -- and that the film is pushing a multicultural agenda. First impressions of 'Force Awakens' trailer \nWhile the hashtag originated with a small but vocal group, part of the reason it trended was due to others tweeting it out of curiosity or defending the films. The debut of the new \"Star Wars\" trailer inspired both fan euphoria and some social media hatred, with the racism-feuled hashtag #BoycottStarWarsVII trending on Twitter. Buzz60 \nDefenders of The Force Awakens included prominent African-American figures such as Selma director Ava Duvernay, who is encouraging Twitter to #CelebrateStarWarsVII instead. â€” Ava DuVernay (@AVAETC) October 19, 2015 #BoycottStarWarsVII folks,Lemme get this straight:Wookies, Ewoks & Droids are fine but a BLACK PERSON is a problem?Go home.You're Drunk. â€” Audra McDonald (@AudraEqualityMc) October 19, 2015 #BoycottStarWarsVII is a prime example of #WhiteFragility Why are you so against seeing a black protagonist?!?
