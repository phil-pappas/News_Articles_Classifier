Tunisia was last in the news under the worst possible circumstances: a shooting assault on a peaceful beach resort in June that left dozens of European tourists dead. The militants of Islamic State claimed responsibility for that strike in the Mediterranean city of Sousse.\nThat attack came only three months after another strike on a landmark museum in the Tunisian capital that left 21 people dead, most of them foreigners.\n(c)2015 Los Angeles Times\nVisit the Los Angeles Times at www.latimes.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nGRAPHIC (for help with images, contact 312-222-4194): Nobel Peace\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1735364", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1735364&h=Nobel+Peace+Prize+awarded+to+National+Dialogue+Quartet+in+Tunisia", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1735364&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T01:20:08.745+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
