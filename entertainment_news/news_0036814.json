They're just really good friends and [I think] it's sweet that they can have this relationship.\" \nBut the Condemned star, whose mother is House of Cards actress Robin Wright, admits it was a little strange to meet the Oscar winning-actor's first wife. \nShe told 'Entertainment Tonight': \"It was kind of surreal to meet her. Like, my dad's ex-lover.\" \nSean, who has been single since splitting from former fianc√©e Charlize Theron in June, previously revealed he and Madonna are still \"very friendly.\" \nSpeaking last year, the 54-year-old star added: \"Initially, in a divorce, you kick and bite about the other person. \n\"But finally you're looking at your failures to that person, to a marriage, to a friendship, to yourself during that time as well. \n\"Because no matter what the other person was or wasn't, for better and for worse, it really has so little to do with the growth you need to find better circumstances. Almost exclusively it has to do with your own stuff.\" celebrities", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T18:39:12.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
