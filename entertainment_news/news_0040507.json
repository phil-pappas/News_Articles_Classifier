Lea Seydoux, the newest Bond girl. (Jonathan Olley/Metro-Goldwyn-May/PA) \nWhile we wait with bated breath to see what the pair will do in Spectre, we revisit our favourite Bond girl moments of all time. 1. Honey Ryder in that bikini – Dr No \nIn the famous scene, later recreated by Halle Berry in Tomorrow Never Dies, Ursula Andress’s Bond girl emerged out of the sea in a white bikini. It’s hard to beat this scene, and sales of white bikinis continue to do well. 2. Pussy Galore’s roll-around in the hay – Goldfinger \nPussy Galore (the best Bond girl name in our opinion), played by Honor Blackman, almost resisted Sean Connery’s Bond charms, but finally succumbed after a playful fight in the hay. 3. Miranda Frost and Jinx’s catfight – Die Another Day \nTwo girls slugging it out isn’t unusual, but having a sword fight in mid-air brings a new dimension. Rosamund Pike’s character Miranda took on Halle Berry’s Giacinta ‘Jinx’ Johnson, while dressed in a cut-out cropped number and white trousers. The X-Men star displayed some impressive gymnastics.

Tracy (Diana Rigg) was killed by a single shot by the agent’s nemesis Blofeld in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, leaving Bond (George Lazenby) distraught. 5. Jill Masterson covered in gold – Goldfinger A model of Shirley Eaton as Jill Masterson painted gold from Goldfinger (Lewis Whyld/PA) \nIt’s a tough gig being a Bond girl. Shirley Eaton, as Jill Masterson, had to endure being painted in gold in the buff for Sean Connery’s third outing as the spy in Goldfinger. But at least her golden appearance made an impression on teenage boys. 6. Vesper Lynd takes on Bond – Casino Royale \nA Bond girl as witty as Bond himself? No wonder Daniel Craig’s Bond fell in love with the sultry French woman played by Eva Green, who was far from being just eye candy. 7. Wai Lin and Bond on that motorcycle chase – Tomorrow Never Dies \nAs played by Michelle Yeoh, she proved she could take care of herself when she and Pierce Brosnan’s Bond escaped from Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce). And her kill count looks pretty impressive too. Strong and steely, while looking bad-ass in a black leather catsuit and heels – what’s not to like? 8. May Day – A View To A Kill \nModel-singer Grace Jones was not one to be messed with as the lover of villain Max Zorin (Christopher Walken) and his chief henchwoman. She also possessed superhuman strength when she faced off against Sir Roger Moore’s Bond. 9. Paris Carver’s death – Tomorrow Never Dies \nSadly for Teri Hatcher, her Bond girl Paris Carver didn’t live to see tomorrow – she was killed after a reunion with Pierce Brosnan’s Bond. But she made an impact in that bedroom scene. 10. Jinx’s orange bikini – Die Another Day \nPaying homage to Ursula Andress’ white bikini scene, Oscar-winning actress Halle Berry relived that scene as Jinx in Die Another Day, with her bikini as a bright orange number. 11. Xenia Onatopp’s crushing moves – GoldenEye \nXenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen) was a worthy opponent for Pierce Brosnan’s Bond, with her crushing moves no match for many enemies. The villainness’s MO? She squeezed her rivals to death between her strong thighs. 12. Elektra King tortures Bond – The World Is Not enough \nAs played by French actress Sophie Marceau, all is not what it seemed with the beautiful Elektra. \nIntent on revenge, she captured 007 and strapped him into an old garrotte device which was designed to slowly break his neck. Then she attempted to seduce him once more, but when called to do his duty, Bond didn’t hesitate: he shot her dead. 13. Speed demon Fiona Volpe – Thunderball \nTough and resourceful Fiona, played by Italian actress Luciana Paluzzi, worked for Spectre in this 1965 film. Not many women can unsettle James Bond, but this operative managed it when she picked him up in her Ford Mustang convertible and gave him a fright with the speed of her driving. Share article \nWhat’s more, she looked ever so cool in motorbike leather while riding a BSA Lightning sports bike, which was equipped with a deadly rocket.
