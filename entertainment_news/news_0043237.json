In the 2014-15 season there were also two — out of 20.\nThat kind of imbalance has fired up a national drive for more gender equality for women playwrights in the American theater.\nOther stats were equally unbalanced. A recent Dramatist Guild-Lilly Awards survey found that between 2011 and 2014, just 22 percent of plays produced at regional theaters were by women. In an experiment, women’s plays submitted under male names garnered a better response from theaters than when the same scripts were credited to women.\nWOMEN WHO OWN THE STAGE A sampling of bold female characters, some coming to Seattle stages this season: \nCaroline in “Luna Gale” by Rebecca Gilman . A burned-out social worker caught in a custody feud over an infant. (Seattle Rep, March 4-27, 2016)\nTess in “Bluestockings” by Jessica Swale. A student who defies misogyny at Cambridge University in the 1890s.\nKitty and Vivie in “Mrs. Warren’s Profession” by G.B. Shaw. A London brothel owner and the disapproving daughter she reunites with. (Seattle Shakespeare Co., March 15-April 10, 2016)\nCaroline in “Caroline, or Change” by Tony Kushner and Jeanine Tesori. A weary, bitter black maid in the South who defies stereotyping.\nJuliana in “The Other Place” by Sharr White. A neuroscientist unraveling a decade-old mystery. (Seattle Public Theater, March 24-April 17, 2016)\nAllison in “Fun Home” by Lisa Kron and Jeanine Tesori. Growing up lesbian in a secretive, dysfunctional family. Based on the graphic novel by Alison Bechdel.\nWhy does this matter? It’s not just an issue of fairness. Women experience life differently than men, given social, biological and other factors. And the human saga the theater mirrors isn’t a full spectrum without their stories.\nMost Read Stories Seattle principal losing his job over unfinished teacher evaluations Seattle Seahawks' Kam Chancellor takes to Twitter to protest fine from NFL 5 ways CaliBurger is better than In-N-Out Seattle Mariners manager Scott Servais may not be a sexy hire, but is he the right one? Sports on TV & radio Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. Where do Seattle theaters sit on that spectrum? More on that later.\nThere is also the question of what characters are dominating the stage. Let’s applaud the prominent Seattle theaters presenting plays with complex lead roles for our leading actresses, whoever wrote them. And let’s spur theaters on to do more of that. (Many of Seattle’s smaller and fringe theater companies need no prompting.)\nNo question, the vast majority of protagonists in Western stage literature are male. That is understandable, given that the vast majority of older dramas were penned by men in eras when they were considered the principal players in life and theater.\nUp until the 20th century, relatively few gifted women had the time, opportunity or space to become playwrights, as Virginia Woolf elucidated in her essay, “A Room of One’s Own.” And certainly more top-girl roles have appeared in recent decades, as women found more chances to have their say and be heard.\nBut from ancient Greek drama and on, some male playwrights have also placed fascinating women center stage. Add those female protagonists to the ones women are creating today, and there’s a long catalog of plum parts — and no shortage of fine performers, in Seattle and beyond, to fill them. \nFor instance, in Joshua Harmon’s dark comedy “Bad Jews” (which closes a run at Seattle Public Theater on Sunday, Oct. 25), the driving force is Daphna, a young, ardently religious Jewish woman who goes to the mat with her secular cousin Liam over a meaningful family heirloom.\nDaphna is a firecracker — smart, loquacious, funny and at times manipulative, obnoxious and smug. She plans to be a rabbi and sneers at less observant Jews — not to mention WASPs like Liam’s shiksa girlfriend.\nAs written, Daphna could easily slide into caricature and anti-Semitic stereotype. But much about her rings true, in the script and in Anna Kasabyan’s fervent, multilayered portrayal. This actress is new to me, but I was impressed with how deeply she delved into Daphna’s roiling psyche. And along with the aggression, how she projected the character’s sincere faith and vulnerabilities.\nWe can also look to Seattle Center for the totemic female character in Seattle Shakespeare Company’s staging of the modern classic, “Mother Courage and Her Children.”\nWritten in 1939 by German dramatist Bertolt Brecht, with significant contributions from Margarete Steffin, the epic drama was Brecht’s response to the Nazi invasion of Poland.\nBut it is a timeless saga of a shrewd, calloused woman peddler hauling her wagon and grown children across landscapes devastated by the Thirty Years War that raged across 17th century Europe. For theaters, the play is a tall order with its episodic format and shifting tone, and it’s rarely mounted in Seattle.\nSo hats off to SSC and director Jeff Steitzer for tackling it, and casting in the title role Jeanne Paulsen, a Tony Award nominee (for “The Kentucky Cycle”) and one of Seattle’s best underutilized actresses.\nPaulsen’s task is to master a role that recently challenged the likes of Meryl Streep. Mother Courage’s complexity makes her neither a heroine nor an outright villain. She’s a parent, a war profiteer, a survivalist at all costs, trying to outsmart the chaotic brutality of endless war. \n“She constantly contradicts herself,” noted Fiona Shaw, who played the role recently in London. “She curses the war, then in the very next scene says that poor people do much better in war than in peace.” \nI can’t wait to see what Paulsen, with her ability to convey rough-hewed authenticity and unsentimental pathos, makes of Mother Courage.\nSome other actresses I look forward to seeing up front this fall:\n• Tony winner Idina Menzel playing one woman in two parallel realities in “If/Then,” written by Brian Yorkey. It’s one of many Broadway musicals that are centered on women, and tours to the Paramount Theatre, Nov. 3-8.\n• For the fringe troupe Theatre 22, Rose Cano is embodying a fascinating Puerto Rican woman. With the online tag of Haikumom, she runs a chat line for recovering drug addicts in “Water by the Spoonful,” a 2012 Pulitzer Prize winner by Latina writer Quiara Alegría Hudes. (Plays at West of Lenin through Nov. 14.)\nSo let’s revisit the question of female playwrights represented on Seattle’s main stages in the 2015-16 season.\nThree out of nine shows at Seattle Rep were written by women — as are three out of eight mainstage shows at ACT Theatre in 2016 (more with upcoming guest and co-productions). Half of the Seattle Children’s Theatre 2014-15 season was written or based on books by women. And at Book-It Repertory Theatre, the adapters of novels for all three season offerings are female.\nWe are moving in the right direction. And let’s keep in mind also that women are capable of writing big, juicy roles for men.\nMisha Berson: mberson@seattletimes.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T16:37:08.046+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
