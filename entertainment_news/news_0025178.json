Fox and Christopher Lloyd Reunite to Showcase the Toyota Mirai; The Future Begins October 21\nTORRANCE, Calif. , Oct. 14, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Get ready for 1.21 gigawatts of fun. Just as Back to the Future fans are gearing up to celebrate the 30 th anniversary of Marty McFly's and Doc Brown's adventures, Toyota teased plans to mark the film's anniversary with a modern twist. Thanks to Toyota, fans can see actors Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd together and get a glimpse of what the automaker has planned leading up to October 21, 2015 – the futuristic date first introduced in Back to the Future Part II and the official on-sale date of Toyota Mirai hydrogen fuel cell vehicle.\nExperience the interactive Multimedia News Release here: http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7658651-toyota-back-to-the-future/\nIn 1985, Universal Pictures' Back to the Future introduced the world to a time-traveling vehicle and what the future may hold. Thirty years later, Toyota has partnered with the beloved films to celebrate the intersection between the U.S. arrival of the Mirai hydrogen fuel cell vehicle and the innovation predicted in the movie. Today's video is just the beginning - fans will have to stay tuned to see how the story unfolds.\n\"Over the years we've had a lot of fun predicting which Back To The Future fictional 2015 technology would arrive by the real year,\" Michael J. Fox said. \"Now that we're a week away, I think fans are going to have a good time with what Toyota sees as a true possibility for transportation. It's actually really cool.\"\nToyota's vision for the future is driven by the Mirai's hydrogen fuel cell technology, which hits the streets of California on October 21 . As Toyota's ongoing \" Fueled by Everything \" digital campaign has demonstrated, hydrogen fuel has the potential to be produced from renewable energy sources like solar, wind and biogas. The vehicle's only tailpipe emission is water.\n\"This Back to the Future -inspired milestone has taken 30 years to arrive, and Toyota has been developing hydrogen fuel cell technology almost that long,\" said Bill Fay , Toyota division group vice president and general manager. \"There's no better way to generate excitement for a turning point in automotive history than with a film that celebrated the possibilities of the future.\"\nWhile the Mirai represents Toyota's vision of the future, the automaker couldn't resist having a bit of fun with the Back to the Future past. Marty McFly's dream truck was a tricked out Toyota truck true fans will recognize. Listen closely in tomorrow's video installment for a clue where a Toyota Tacoma re-creation of that famous 4X4 will be headed when the future arrives on October 21 . (Hint, there's more than one place.)\n\"While there are a lot of brands and activations that are celebrating the Back to the Future milestone, Toyota stands apart for their nod to the future and the past with the auto technology depicted in the movies,\" said Bob Gale , Back to the Future co-creator and producer. \"When Toyota approached us about helping tell a bigger story about the future and innovation with the Mirai, we loved the direction – and who can resist Marty's retro Toyota truck?\"\nToyota's Back to the Future partnership will crescendo on Oct. 20 as the clock nears midnight toward the futuristic milestone. With a party ready for the fourth dimension, digital activations and physical displays, Toyota will welcome the future to California with the Mirai on sale launch.\nToyota's \"Fueled by Everything\" campaign was created with creative agency partner Droga5, while the Back to the Future Tacoma elements drew on Saatchi & Saatchi Los Angeles expertise.
