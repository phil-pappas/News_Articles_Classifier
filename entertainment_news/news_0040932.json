The boy, studying in standard six, is starring in ABC, a Hindi short film made to show the dichotomy of two characters leading very different lives.His co-star will be actress Sruthi Hariharan. Produced by Babul Saha and Shajan Samuel, ABC will mark Shahbaaz's debut, although he has starred in a few television advertisements before.\n\"My son did not have to miss classes for this project, and he was groomed for about 20 days in the evenings after school. The film was shot in three days, and we are very proud of him.However, we want him to focus on completing his education,\" says an elated Saleem.\nShahbaaz plays a young, destitute orphan who struggles to make ends meet by doing all sorts of odd jobs, but at the end of the day, still has a happy-go-lucky nature. Sruthi, on the other hand, plays a wealthy 25-year-old entrepreneur, who, despite having everything, feels restless even as she searches for happiness.\nAn adaptation of the original written by Sonia Mackwani, who won first place in a national short story competition, ABC is a 16-minute short. Director Madan Ramvenkatesh says they consciously decided to keep it \"sweet and simple\" for the audience.\"Both characters have contrasting roles, and what follows when they meet forms the crux of the film. Since Shahbaaz is a newbie, we roped in some theatre artistes to groom him before we shot the film. He is a hyperactive child but gave his best for the film.\"\nThe film is all set to premiere at 11 am on Friday, at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan on Race Course Road. It has already been submitted to a few national and international film festivals across the country for screening, he adds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:17:21.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
