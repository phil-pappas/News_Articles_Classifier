Here's what Moranis told The Hollywood Reporter . \n\"I hope (the movie is) terrific. But it just makes no sense to me. Why would I do just one day of shooting on something I did 30 years ago?\" \nNow, that doesn't mean Moranis has retired from acting-- though he did several years off after his wife died-- he's actually open to new projects, he told THR. \n\"... as soon as one comes along that piques my interest, I'll probably do it. [But Ghostbusters ] didn't appeal to me.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:54:53.999+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
