Chances are, if there's a band playing at Barry's or Hatter's or Rubino's, I know them. And I'm pleased to call most of them very good friends. Just recently I learned about a relatively new band, called Rain & Leaves. Its members, Josh Falling and Cassie Roberts, are Webster folk. They're friends of some friends, so I don't know them very well yet. But I expect that to change very soon, because I do love their music and will be making an effort to catch their shows when they play at Barry's. Or Hatter's. Or Rubino's. Or anywhere else.\nJosh and Cassie have released a new EP, which they'll officially introduce at a CD release party on Friday October 16 at the Harmony House, 58 East Main Street in Webster.\nThe CD, titled Buttons EP , includes six original tunes: \"Next,\" \"Stop,\" \"Rewind,\" \"Play,\" \"Fast Forward,\" and \"Record,\" featuring Cassie on bass and vocals, and Josh on electric guitar, acoustic guitar, ukulele, synth, drums and vocals. Together they create a sound which they describe as \"electropop original,\" interspersed with an entertaining assortment of popular and alternative covers.\nIn addition to music from Rain & Leaves, the concert will feature appearances by Barry's Crossing , Seek No Bounds and Gregg Albertson .\nAdmission is $6, which includes a copy of Buttons EP, or $3 without the CD. Tickets will be available at the door and through the Rain & Leaves Facebook page . the concert begins at 7 pm, and doors will open at 6:30.\nFor more information about Rain & Leaves, and to purchase a copy of their new Buttons EP , log onto their website at www.rainandleaves.com , or their Facebook page at www. facebook.com/rainandleaves .\nCassie Roberts and Josh Falling are the duo Rain &amp; Leaves (provided photo)\n* * *\nemail me at missyblog@gmail.com\n\"Like\" this blog on Facebook and follow me on Twitter", "external_links": ["http://www.barryscrossing.com/", "http://www.rainandleaves.com/", "http://bit.ly/dluMG1", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/29/Rochester/wp-ROC-WebsterBlog-23185-rain-and-leaves-duo.jpg", "https://twitter.com/Missyblog", "https://www.facebook.com/SeekNoBounds?fref=nf", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/350e6ee2fcaa0ae26517005f1c1050fad3ec870e/c=113-0-408-524&r=583&c=0-0-580-1031/local/-/media/2015/09/29/Rochester/wp-ROC-WebsterBlog-23185-rain-and-leaves-duo.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/RainAndLeaves"], "published": "2015-09-30T05:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:05:22.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
