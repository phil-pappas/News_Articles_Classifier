Sources say the participation of both of them in the third season of the Kannada Bigg Boss is confirmed. The telecast of the show is scheduled for September 17.\nMaithriya and Roopashree, considered close friends suddenly turned against each other last week. Allegedly Roopashree spoke ill about Maithriya with a third person. Maithriya filed a complaint with the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce about with and even submitted a recorded copy of the alleged conversation. This resulted in mutual mud-slinging. As if on cue, both of them seem to have made it to the final shortlist of the new season of the Bigg Boss show.\nAnother actor Huchcha Venkat who is probably the only one with audience demanding his presence on the show, is being wooed. The eccentric Venkat is a hard nut and sources said the channel authorities were not keen on casting him. His unpredictable behaviour was supposed to be too hard to control. However in the last two weeks since his name was not in consideration there is a growing demand for his inclusion. His fans, especially online, were vocal in their demand for his inclusion. Sources said that there are last-minute attempts to get him on board.\nAnother speculation was about the presence of actors Diganth and Aindrita Ray. At least one of the speculated couple will be in the house, sources said. Insiders say the original list of contestants has undergone a big change. With some of the selected contestants backing out, there are frantic attempts to get the backups ready. The trials for the show is ongoing with fake contestants already housed in the 'house' built near Bengaluru. This edition of the Kannada Bigg Boss gets its own house instead of using the one used for the Hindi and other versions in Lonavala.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:16:20.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
