Set on Long Island, it turns on an affair between a married author and a local waitress only the story is told largely in flashback and from two radically different points of view. And yes, the police are involved. Wilson won a Golden Globe for her performance and the show itself took the award for Best Television Series.\nBeyond The Reach (12)\nMichael Douglas does what he does so well on screen – acts slimy and unhinged – in this adaptation of Robb White's 1972 novel Deathwatch. Douglas plays a wealthy hunter who hires a local guide (Jeremy Irvine) to take him into the Mojave desert. You can guess the rest.\nShare article On The Beach (PG)\nClassic (and early) post-apocalyptic thriller based on Nevil Shute's 1957 novel about the aftermath of world war three and the efforts of a few survivors to make contact with the sender of a Morse signal which seems to be coming from the US. As radiation clouds drift south to their Australian redoubt, they know they're going to die anyway, so why not? Released in 1959 it stars Gregory Peck and Ava Gardner, and this Blu-Ray release comes packed with extras.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-11T07:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T07:33:19.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
