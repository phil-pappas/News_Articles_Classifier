The story of a radical poet-balladeer, hauled to court for waging war against the state, will represent the country in the Academy's Best Foreign Language Film category.\nWritten and directed by first-time filmmaker Chaitanya Tamhane, the film follows the trial of ageing folk singer Narayan Kamble, arrested on charges of abetting a sewage worker's suicide through inflammatory songs. Made on a modest budget of Rs 3.5 crore and released this July , 'Court' soon snapped up national and global accolades, including the National Award and the 'Lion of the Future' honour at the Venice International Film Festival. It was selected as the Oscar entry over films like the Rs 250-crore 'Bahubali', the Aamir Khan-starrer 'PK' and the hugely popular 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan'. The 28-year-old Tamhane, who is currently in Ja pan for the Fukuoka International Film Festival, expressed joy and \"genuine surprise\" at the decision. \"Ever since we started making the film, we kept our expectations low.Since these results tend to be so unpredictable, it just felt like a wise thing to not expect too much,\" said Tamhane and producer Vivek Gomber in a statement to the media.\nFor filmmakers and critics back home though, the news that 'Court' would represent the country globally came as no surprise. \"It's a film which truly fits into the category of world cinema,\" said Marathi film critic Ganesh Matkari. Filmmaker San deep Sawant, whose 2004 film 'Shwaas' had been the first Marathi film to head to the Oscars, said, \"Court's story, the way it's been shot, the acting, is superlative.\" A flurry of activity now lies ahead for the 'Court' team in order to get nominated -from organizing screenings for the Academy's selection committee members to ensuring advertisements are carried in US film magazines. \"We had to have blackand-white ads, of course. We couldn't afford colour,\" said Sawant, laughing, as he recalled their scramble to raise funds for publicizing 'Shwaas', made on an even smaller budget of Rs 30 lakh. \"But the industry has come a long way since. I'm so glad there is more support provided to films like these.\"\n'Court' is the third Marathi film to be India's entry to the Academy Awards, after 'Shwaas' and 'Harishchandrachi Factory'. The 'Court' team though maintains theirs is a multi-lingual film. Though the milieu and most of the dialogue is in Marathi, characters also speak in Gujarati, Hindi and English. \"It reflects the diversity of languages and culture in our country,\" said actor Geetanjali Kulkarni.\nJury member quits\nFilmmaker Rahul Rawail, part of the 17-member Oscar selection jury, resigned from his position, citing fellow jury member Amol Palekar's \"obnoxious behavior\" as the reason. He tweeted on Wednesday, explaining that his resignation had nothing to do with 'Court' being selected as India's official entry.
