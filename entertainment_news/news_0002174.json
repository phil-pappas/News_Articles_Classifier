Personal data from thousands of employees was reportedly compromised along with private emails from celebrities and executives.

It is now awaiting court approval. \nThe agreement was \"mutually agreed upon with the plaintiffs and is an important, positive step forward in putting the cyber-attack firmly behind us,\" Michael Lynton, the studio's CEO, said in a memo to staff on Tuesday. \nLynton said the proposal extends existing credit and fraud monitoring for employees for two more years. \nThe studio \"has emerged from the cyber-attack a stronger company with a smart and strategic vision for the road ahead,\" he wrote. \"We are looking forward, not back, and we are confident and optimistic about our future.\" \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource .
