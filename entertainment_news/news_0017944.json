Most were already looking a little lost. They lined up in two rows an arms' length apart and their instructor, Master Tracker Levi Montgomery, walked between them, leaving footprints in the path. \nThey watched closely as his boots hit the ground in front of them. But when Montgomery asked them to point out some sign of his passing, they had trouble seeing any evidence of it among the leaves, twigs and weeds at their feet. \nWith a shake of his head, Montgomery said, \"I've had several come up to me and say, 'I see where you're pointing, but I don't see anything.' I remember those days. I thought the instructor was pulling my leg, saying, lsquo;Look. It's right there in front of you,' and his finger is touching it, and I'm saying lsquo;I don't see anything.'\" \nMost novices expect to see actual footprints, but Montgomery says that's rare. He explains that wildland tracking is about noticing and interpreting the tiniest of clues: a broken twig, a disturbed pebble, or maybe an overturned leaf. It requires practice and patience, \"slowing my brain down enough and relax from inner city living and get out into the country and actually start determining the disturbance in the ground.\" \nA couple of hours into the class, things are going better, perhaps because the students have now been divided into four-person tracking teams. The team leader focuses on the small clues left by each step. Flankers roam to either side to ensure the direction of travel hasn't changed. The rear observer looks down the trail for more obvious signs of passage. \nAmong their tools are poles and rubber bands, used to measure the stride between tracked steps. They move the rubber bands up or down the pole to mark the distance between steps. Then, if they are having trouble seeing the next step, they use the stick to estimate the arc in which it likely fell. \nHugh Berryman, director of the Forensic Institute for Research and Education at Middle Tennessee State University, a master tracker, is hosting today's class. Tracking is usually referred to as an art, but Berryman believes it will someday be a science. \n\"There's certain things that we use in tracking to determine how long it's been since a person passed a certain area,\" he explained. \"It has to do with insect activity, it has to do with plants and the way plants respond to damage, color changes and things like that. And I think there's all sorts of opportunities for research projects in that.\" \nWhether art or science, the mantracking classes are proving popular with law enforcement officers, emergency management officials, forensic students and with the general public. Berryman and the Forensic Institute plan to conduct four training sessions each year.
