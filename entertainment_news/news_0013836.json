Make some f**king noise for Rudimental!'' \nEarlier in the night the group from Hackey united vocalists Anne-Marie - a former three times world karate champion - and Will Heard on stage for recent hit 'Rumour Mill' from their second studio album 'We The Generation'. \nWill continued to add his vocals to 'I Will for Love' after which DJ Locksmith addressed the hyped crowd and said: ''Thank you for making it (We The Generation) Number One in the UK charts.'' \nSinger/songwriter Thomas Jules also commanded the stage and performed synchronised dance steps with Locksmith. \nHe introduced the another fan favourite track and announced: ''Going back to the old school. For my five year old son, 'I'm Not Giving In' put your hands together.' \nMeanwhile, the eclectic group - including Amir Amor on bass and Kesi Dryden who played the drum kit - offered up a taste of their musical roots by closing the night with a mix of dancehall tracks that included 'World A Music', 'You Don't Love Me (No No No)' and 'One Of Those Days' originally sang by Jamaican singers Ini Kamoze, Dawn Penn and Sizzla respectively. \nHowever the experimenters added further intrigue by singing Ed Sheeran's fan favourite 'Thinking Out Loud' over the top of the melodies. \nThe night also included opening sets from Izzy Bizu, Max, Kiko Bun and Aba Shanti.
