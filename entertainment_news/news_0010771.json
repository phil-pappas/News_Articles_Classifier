Thousands of customers of pre-paid debit cards backed by Simmons remain without access to their money more than a week after technical problems first began plaguing the cards. The problems with the RushCard started Oct.12, when a software upgrade in the transaction processing system caused many accounts to show a zero balance or left customers unable to access to their funds.
