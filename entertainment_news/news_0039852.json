Good! Now for the interesting part, the real question hidden in that headline is do you understand what the word conundrum means?\nWe spend a great deal of time and money teaching our children to read and we find ourselves proud beyond belief when they can go “Jane has a cat”. By definition being able to read and write words does make you literate. But that definition is in desperate need of expansion as simply being able to pronounce words and write them down does not mean you truly understand them. Think about your child reading “cat” but not being able to tell you what a “cat” is. Defeats the purpose of the entire exercise, does it not?\nLiteracy ultimately should be routed in understanding what you’re reading in the context that you are reading it in. If you are not able to do that then all you have is a bunch of words and a whole smorgasbord of confusion.\nUnfortunately in a large percentage of our country’s foundation phase schools this is exactly the outcome (or worse). Learners travel from grade to grade not understanding what they are reading or writing. Not comprehending that the same word can have two completely different meanings if utilised in a different context. Without this understanding these learners are unable to grasps the concepts that the teachers are trying to bring across. As they journey through school their comprehension becomes less as the terminology becomes more complex.\nBecause of this simple fact we are failing our children in every subject imaginable. These children will never understand the value of education, as they will never understand the concepts and ultimately they will drop out of the education system all together. The statistics are well published but the underlying reason remains well hidden from the public at large.\nThe biggest irony is that the solution is easily found. We have organisations doing amazing work in literacy around the country and all we need is the will and conviction to take these solutions and implement them in our schools. At the moment amazing ideas are left to languish in a chosen few schools and once the private sector funding dries up (as it inevitable does) they die out and the idea is lost.\nOne such organisation, Living Through Learning (www.livingthroughlearning.org.za), is a Cape Town based NGO that has been working with 20 foundation phase schools on two key literacy projects.\nThe first is the setting up of their specialized Reading Rooms at the individual schools. The rooms come with a proven methodology and implementation plan to allow learners to gain not only the vocabulary but also the underlying understanding of what the individual words mean. The successful implementation of these rooms has seen literacy levels in these schools increase with an average of over 10% in just one year.\nThe second project is a teachers training program that assist educators to be better equipped to teach subjects to a class that has varying degrees of understanding. Allowing teachers to manage the gradient at which they teach to ensure comprehension within the class.\nBoth these projects have had amazing results and have been praised by teachers, learners and even the Education Department itself. All the evidence indicates that projects such as the Reading Rooms are more effective at ensuring lasting results than the base curriculum being utilised at the schools today.\nNow the key questions are:\n· - If it works, why is it not part of the curriculum or the teaching methodologies employed in our schools?\n· - Why are these organisations struggling to get funding and unable to roll these projects out further?\n· - Why is the Department of Education not taking it on and rolling it out?\nAs a society we need to start asking these tough questions and looking for the answers. It’s hard because on some level we are all to blame. For too long we have been accepting the norms and turning a blind eye, or worse still simply waiting for government to fix it “their” problem.\nThe child in Bishops should in theory be well taking care of (even if he requires remedial lessons) but what about the child in Bishop Lavis? Who campaign’s for him/her and who make sure that the correct program reaches them?\nWe must stop standing back and waiting as this perennial inaction and unwillingness to move forward is leaving us in a precarious position on the edge of an illiterate cliff.\nI urge you the reader to learn more about organisations such as Living Through Learning and give them the support they so desperately need, to bring about the change that our children deserve.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:33:38.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
