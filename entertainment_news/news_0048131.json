He won an Oscar for best original screenplay for Milk, a film based on the life of gay rights activist and politician Harvey Milk. \nIn his YouTube video posted in December 2013, Tom, 21, said his “whole world changed” when he fell in love with a man. (Ian West/PA) \nHe said: “Come spring this year my life changed massively when I met someone and they make me feel so happy, so safe, and everything just feels great and, well, that someone is a guy. \n“And it did take me by surprise a little bit. It was always in the back of my head that something like that could happen, but it wasn’t until spring this year that something just clicked, it felt right.” \nHe added: “Of course I still fancy girls but right now I’m dating a guy and I couldn’t be happier. It makes me feel safe and it just really does feel right.” \nTom was widely praised for his honesty after posting his video. \nLance grew up in a Mormon home in Texas and has spoken of his fears that he was “going to hell” when he first developed feelings for a boy as a child. \nIn his emotionally charged Oscar speech he told how the story of Harvey Milk gave him “hope to live my life” and urged greater acceptance of gay and lesbian people. He said: “It gave me the hope that one day I could live my life openly as who I am and maybe even I could fall in love and one day get married.
