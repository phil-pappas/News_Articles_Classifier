Personal branding and online reputation management are crucial for individuals, for job seekers, for corporate executives, for almost anyone in the business world. Hiring managers use search engines like Google and Bing and social media sites such as LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, and Google+ to vet prospective hires. The public identities of CEOs, managers, and other highly visible members of startups, businesses, and nonprofits are just a click away from anyone: a potential business partner, an investment banker, or a journalist, for example. But on the negative side, one's online reputation can be attacked and one's digital footprint made less than ideal.\nAbout Jason McDonald\nJason McDonald is director of The JM Internet Group, a leading online training company.
