The incident occurred days after the 50-year-old Knight was wounded in a nightclub shooting.\nThe Death Row Records co-founder is also charged in a separate murder case. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Williams has also pleaded not guilty.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/40/06/8782213/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/40/06/8782213/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-13T11:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:48:20.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
