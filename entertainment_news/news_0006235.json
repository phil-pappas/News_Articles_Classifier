That deal is still in process. The acquisition of EMC is seen helping Dell diversify from the stagnant personal computer market and give it the scale to attack the faster-growing and more lucrative market for managing and storing data for businesses. \nEMC will have a “go-shop” provision that will allow the data storage company to seek out other buyers and give EMC a discounted breakup fee if it finds a more desirable deal, EMC chairman and CEO Joe Tucci told CNBC. ”We will do our duty to make sure we get the best deal for our shareholders and time will show,” he said. \nAccording to technology site wired.com , here are the previous big technology deals: \nDell – EMC (2015): $67 Billion; HP – Compaq (2001): $25 billion; Facebook – WhatsApp (2014): $19 billion; HP – EDS (2008): $13.9 billion; Symantec – Veritas (2004): $13.5 billion; Google – Motorola Mobility(2011): $12.5 billion; Oracle – PeopleSoft (2005): $10.3 billion; HP – Autonomy (2011): $10.3 billion; Microsoft – Skype (2011): $8.5 billion; Oracle – BEA Systems (2008): $8.5 billion; Oracle – Sun Microsystems (2010): $7.4 billion; Microsoft – Nokia (2013): $7.2 billion. \nBy Arun Kumar \n  5:02 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:52:01.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
