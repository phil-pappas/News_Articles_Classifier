When a Deadite plague threatens to destroy all of mankind, Ash is finally forced to face his demons - personal and literal. Destiny, it turns out, has no plans to release the unlikely hero from its evil grip.\" Ash will be joined by new faces Pablo (Ray Santiago) and Kelly (Dana Delorenzo) in actions. Lucy Lawless also joins the cast as Ruby, \"a mysterious figure who is myopic in her quest to hunt down the source of the recent Evil outbreaks.
