Lena Dunham effusively thanked her longtime collaborator and mentor Judd Apatow for helping her get through the trauma of going public with her account of sexual assault.\nThe “Girls” star took the stage for a surprise speech at The Rape Foundation’s annual brunch in Los Angeles Sunday. The brunch raised money for the Rape Treatment Center and Stuart House at the Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center, which provides care for rape victims and sexually abused children.\nDunham wrote candidly about her experience of sexual assault in her bestselling book “Not That Kind of Girl: A Young Woman Tells You What She’s Learned.”\n“I can safely say I would have not emerged from the darkness of that period without the constant check ins, sweet jokes and unwaveringly loving presence of Judd,” Dunham said, according to People. “But he was more than a friend. He was a consistent reminder to me of something his work has always represented, which is that it’s never wrong to speak the truth.”\nGregg DeGuire/WireImage Lena Dunham and longtime love Jack Antanoff at The Rape Foundation’s Annual Brunch. Apatow happily accepted but jokingly noted that his primary contribution has been posting scores of angry tweets about Bill Cosby.\n“Someone has to stand up for these women,” Apatow said. “Someone in his community needs to call him out and say, ‘This is awful, you should be in jail’ and we all need to support the victims and tell them ‘we care about you and we believe in you.'”\nDunham attended the event with her love of three years, musician Jack Antanoff.\nRelated Stories Lena Dunham calls Cosby 'a rapist' during event with Apatow Lena Dunham tells Ellen she's still not ready for marriage 10 facts about Lena Dunham and Jenni Konner's Lenny Letter", "external_links": ["http://www.people.com/article/lena-dunham-honors-judd-apatow-rape-foundation-brunch"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:09:23.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
