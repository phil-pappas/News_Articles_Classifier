We haven't done airplane drops for 50 plus years, but it apparently worked pretty well back then to reestablish them in remote places,\" Steve Nadeau of Idaho Fish and Game told Boise State Public Radio.\nCopyright 2015 by United Press International Share Comment", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1742550&h=Long%2Dlost+film+shows+beavers+being+relocated+via+parachute+in+1948", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1742550", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1742550&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:21:14.387+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
