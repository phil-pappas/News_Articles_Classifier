It's about to be the weekend, babies! If you are one-half as excited as I am, you'll have a nice time. Not only does the weather forecast portend some actual fall temperatures (highs in the mid-60s! Woot woot!), but Gregslist forecasts a great lineup of things to do. Here they are, ranked in order of sheer greatness: \n1. Laugh like it’s 1975, or 932… or 1215, depending on how you look at it. Enjoy a classic sendup of the King Arthur story (932 A.D.) with Moxie Cinema , 305 S. Campbell Ave. Saturday at 9 p.m.,Springfield’s indie/art movie house is showing a screening of \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" on a first-come, first-seated basis… for free (free, y’all: That’s why I’m ranking this No. 1!). Yes, the Moxie is a nonprofit, but it’s not really in the business of handing out free movie tickets to grown-ups. Why is it happening right now? The answer is quirky (and I hope you expect no less from Gregslist): Monty Python, released in 1975, is part of an 800th-anniversary celebration of the Magna Carta that’s going on this fall. Remember it from history class? In 1215, the Magna Carta was the document that first put limits on the power of the English king, establishing that whole Rule of Law thing. We wouldn’t have the U.S. Constitution without it. Missouri State University has more at missouristate.edu/magnacarta . \n2. Gaze at gorgeous art while you pick up some produce. Farmers Park is hosting an art show Saturday (9 a.m.-5 p.m.) and Sunday (10 a.m.-4 p.m.) that runs concurrently with Farmers Market of the Ozarks (Saturday, through 1 p.m.). The curated art show — a first for Farmers Park — has 20 award-winning visual artists from around the Ozarks booked. You’ll find paintings, but also photography, prints, ceramics, metalsmith jewelry, sculpture, stained glass and even furniture. On Sunday, Aviary Café has an outdoor brunch, and from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., Smokey Folk will share their “folk rock with a vaudeville twist” brand of music. Maybe think of it as ArtsFest: Southeast Edition? Regardless, set your GPS to 2144 E. Republic Road. \n3. Pay tribute to the chops, and impressive longevity, of Earth, Wind & Fire. JQH Arena hosts the seventh top-selling musical group of all time in a concert Friday at 8 p.m. Tickets were still available at jqharena.missouristate.edu when I checked early this week, which surprises me a tad bit, but JQH is a big space. Maybe EWF will sing “September?” They've been doing this since 1969. Ba de ya, folks… Buy Photo \nThe fall fun on C-Street Saturday includes a pet parade and trick-or-treating for kids and pets alike. (Photo: News-Leader file photo) \n4.Take over Commercial Street with your dog! The Pets & Pumpkins Festival is now in its eighth year. From noon to 5 p.m. Saturday, the family fun is focused on 219 W. Commercial St. Trick-or-treating for pets and kids alike is on offer, along with marshmallow-roasting, games, inflatables, food and music. It’s free to attend, but there’s a $2 charge to participate in the pet parade and costume contest. You’ll want to bring your own chair. I used to live on Commercial Street, and this festival was a highlight of the fall, and not just for little kids and their families. More info is available at facebook.com/PetsandPumpkins . \n5. Celebrate Americana with Silver Dollar City . Not sure if everyone knows, but long before I lived in Springfield, I lived in Branson: I was born and grew up there. For many native Taney County people, Silver Dollar City is a destination for all four seasons. Through Oct. 30, the park is putting on the National Harvest & Cowboy Festival, which includes 125 visiting artisans who demonstrate their crafts, along with cowboy poetry, fall food and everything SDC has to offer. This weekend is important because it’s the final weekend for the festival’s Wild West Show. Inspired by Buffalo Bill and the American West, it celebrates folk mythology of the wild West, including figures like Calamity Jane, Annie Oakley and “Wild Bill” Hickok. One-day admission is $60 for adults, making it a bit of a premium trip, but well worth it. Details at silverdollarcity.com . \nBonus: Did you know it’s Missouri State University homecoming weekend? Of course you did! As a Mizzou grad, my J-school classmates may never forgive me for this, but let me sing the praises of the Bears’ big weekend. Missouri State alums can live it up in downtown Springfield for less Friday and Saturday. Just put on your BearWear. Thanks to the MSU alumni association, the maroon and white earns you discounts at 15 locations, including Hotel Vandivort, The Coffee Ethic, Pappo’s Pizzeria and Big Whiskey’s. Itsalldowntown.com has details. 46 CONNECT 10 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://sgfnow.co/1RJ68q6 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T04:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:50:18.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
