Look who‚Äôs back‚Ä¶ (Richard Kendal/BBC/Hat Trick) \nIt was his first BBC TV appearance since he was ditched by Top Gear following his infamous altercation with a producer. \nSome were pleased to see him back. Clarkson is back on our screens! It‚Äôs been too long. #hignfy \n‚Äî Tom (@TwitTommyTom) October 2, 2015 \nSome very much weren‚Äôt. Hmmmm should I watch Jeremy Clarkson on #HIGNFY or should I scoop my own eyeballs out with a teaspoon? \nSome were wondering why he was even there in the first place. Anyone explain to me how 'sacked from the BBC' Jeremy Clarkson is presenting HIGNFY tonight? \n‚Äî Japhy Ryder (@JaphyRyder_) October 2, 2015 \nIt didn‚Äôt take long for the inevitable Clarkson-bashing to begin. \nRichard Osman was first. When Clarkson asked what ITV2 was, the Pointless star said: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll find out soon enough, Jeremy.‚Äù \nThen, making reference to Clarkson‚Äôs new show on Amazon Prime, he said: ‚ÄúAre you sure it‚Äôs Amazon Prime and not Amazon past-their-prime?‚Äù Richard Osman is brilliant, his digs at Clarkson are classüôå #HIGNFY \n‚Äî Rory Cellan-Jones (@ruskin147) October 2, 2015 \nHe then got in another one when the conversation turned to the Piggate scandal. He put his Clarkson in a pigs mouth!!! #HIGNFY Richard Osman take a bow fella. \nPeople liked that a lot. Brilliant Richard Osman slaughtering Clarkson on #HIGNFY \n‚Äî Keith Waugh (@blackcatkw) October 2, 2015 #hignfy Loving Richard Osman giving Clarkson a hard time!! Very funny guy. \n‚Äî Moira Trezise (@MoiTrez) October 2, 2015 \nThen as Osman continued to pile in with continued references to Chris Evans ‚Äì the man replacing Clarkson on Top Gear ‚Äì panellist Camilla Long said: ‚ÄúGo on, punch him.‚Äù \nAnd he looked like he might, too. Falling in love with @richardosman . Clarkson's shock/disgust at being on the other end of teasing is remarkable. #HIGNFY \n‚Äî James O'Brien (@mrjamesob) October 2, 2015 Clarkson visibally irritated by Osman at this stage. I love it! That post show Steak better on point or things could get out of hand #HIGNFY \n‚Äî Tronald Dump (@CormacCor) October 2, 2015 Clarkson is a joyless old grump when he's the one being picked on. No love lost here #HIGNFY \n‚Äî Greg Jenner (@greg_jenner) October 2, 2015 \nAnd still the barbs kept coming ‚Äì this time as the panel talked about a society called the Dull Men‚Äôs Club. \nOsman chimed in with: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs annoying, you‚Äôll have to think of another name for your new show.‚Äù . @richardosman is on fire on #hignfy . Really giving it to Clarkson with both barrels. \n‚Äî Margo Milne (@MargoJMilne) October 2, 2015 \nIt should be said for balance ‚Äì it is a BBC show, after all ‚Äì that some people weren‚Äôt entirely on Team Osman. Wow, how jealous is Richard Osman of Jeremy Clarkson!? Lost all respect for Osman. #HIGNFY \n‚Äî Sarah Colledge (@Sarah_Colledge) October 2, 2015 Bit excessive for Richard Osman to make a \"jokey\" jibe at Jeremy Clarkson every 30 seconds. Was funny at first, just annoying now #HIGNFY \n‚Äî Charlotte Tobitt (@charlottet1992) October 2, 2015 How annoying is richard osman, give it a rest #HIGNFY \n‚Äî Josh Lawlor (@joshualawlor) October 2, 2015 \nBut by and large, viewers were delighted to see Clarkson squirm. Loving @richardosman on #HIGNFY stick it to Clarkson \n‚Äî Simon Passey (@Simon_Passey) October 2, 2015 #hignfy returned on top form tonight ‚Äì @richardosman especially. Can never have enough Clarkson jokes. \n‚Äî Rob Lynch (@discobadgers) October 2, 2015 \nYou couldn‚Äôt help but feel, though, that the most entertaining moment of the evening might have come after the cameras stopped rolling. They should have kept the mikes running after the show. Would love to know what Clarkson just said to Osman!! #HIGNFY", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T23:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:41:20.339+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
