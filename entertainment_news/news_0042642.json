The district also has set aside Oct. 24 to tie up loose ends, but the bulk of the removal is expected to be finished in the first session.\nA large wooden dragon, a welcome sign, brick pavers and a recognition board outlining the history of the original project will be saved and incorporated into the new, 10,000-square-foot version to be installed beginning next spring. The features at the Kids Castle replacement will be fully accessible to children with disabilities.\n\"It's an all-in playground, a place like that is conducive to all walks of life and all abilities,\" Fougerousse said.\nAbout $200,000 of the cost is for a poured-in-place, rubberized play surface. Visit www.vhparkdistrict.org for renderings and more information.\nTo offset the cost, the park district is selling commemorative bricks, as well as ride sponsorship opportunities of $5,000, $10,000 and $25,000 at the new playground.\n News Vernon Hills Park District Volunteering", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-14T13:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:06:33.279+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
