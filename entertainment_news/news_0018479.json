In fact, if anything, she goes overboard in the effort to make her presence felt.\n\nIn the frames that she shares with Irrfan, her melodramatic approach offers a direct contrast to the male lead's measured underplaying.\n\nEach serves as a counterfoil to the other, making Jazbaa feel like a two-in-one film in terms of histrionic styles.\n\nAishwarya plays advocate Anuradha Verma, a super-successful lawyer who has never lost a case. She is now in danger of losing her pre-teen daughter to kidnappers who want her to save a rape and murder convict from the gallows in lieu of ransom.\n\nOld friend and tainted cop Yohaan (Irrfan), who has lost his job on charges of corruption, jumps into the fray to help the lady extricate herself from the tight spot.\n\nAnuradha, who has only four days to secure bail for the rapist (Chandan Roy Sanyal), also has to contend with the ire of the victim's mother (Shabana Azmi).\n\nJazbaa is the story of two daughters, one dead and crying out for justice and the other in the clutches of evil captors who cannot be trusted, and two mothers who have scores to settle.\n\nThe film creates a dark and twisted world inhabited by drug dealers and addicts, a powerful politician (Jackie Shroff) determined to save his career at all cost, and lawyers and cops who are hostages to a system that grinds down the meek and shields the guilty.\n\nBut Jazbaa, a remake of a South Korean thriller, does not go beyond broad superficialities. Its interest lies merely in mining the legal situation for its potential for suspense and intrigue.\n\nThe film achieves its end to a certain extent, but falls way short of delivering the riveting, edge-of-the-seat thriller that it should have been.\n\nIn the end, the surface zest visible in Jazbaa does not quite translate into the sort of fire that might have elevated it to a different plane.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T13:08:46.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
