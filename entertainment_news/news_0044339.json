Godwin Muzari Arts Editor— Gospel musician Diva Mafunga has collaborated with Oliver “Tuku” Mtukudzi on two exciting tracks titled “Munana Wekutanga” and “Kutenda Kusina Mabasa”. The tracks are on Mafunga’s new seven-track album titled “Ndatenda Ndapinda” that was recorded at Diamond Studios. The album also features renowned drummer Obert Gomba, who was part of Alick Macheso’s strongest Orchestra Mberikwazvo team before he left the sungura musician’s outfit. He worked with Mafunga as a session instrumentalist. Tuku did vocals and played acoustic guitar on the two songs and the musicians’ voices blend well on the tracks. The songs are already making impact on the airwaves and the album is likely to take Mafunga to a higher level than the standard he set with his popular release “Endai Naizvozvo”. “Endai Naizvozo” was undoubtedly Mafunga’s best product before the new album and it is certain that the musician, who is now based in Plumtree, will go places with the current product. Tuku is not new to gospel music. He has done various hymns and choruses on his previous albums and is on record saying he has ‘‘never sung for the devil’’ because most of his songs carry messages that tally with Christian doctrines. His gospel touch complements Mafunga’s inspiring compositions. The gospel musician has always made the acoustic guitar an integral component of his instrumentation and bringing in Tuku’s guitar on “Ndatenda Ndapinda” gave the album a unique flair. On “Munana Wekutanga” Mafunga says the first miracle that God performs to everyone is giving life. He says it is by God’s grace that one wakes up well every morning because a lot happens at night and many people have died in their sleep. Tuku’s backing vocals give emphasis on the theme and the way the musicians vocally complement each other gives the track a serious appeal. The other duet “Kutenda Kusina Mabasa” is a reminder of the Biblical assertion that ‘‘faith without works is dead’’. Again, the musicians present the theme in an appealing way. They celebrate God’s love and the most interesting part is when Mafunga sings about how God ‘‘gives water to the thirsty’’ and Tuku comes in with a line about a calabash of water (mukombe wemvura). Tuku’s latest album is titled “Mukombe Wemvura” and the line becomes an intersection of the two musicians’ separate works. The broader message on the track encourages people to do good works to others to fulfil their faith and Christian beliefs. The duets are likely to cause waves on the gospel music scene and entertainment sect at large. It was a well-timed arrangement for Mafunga whose last album “Zvangu Zvaita” did not make much impact. Besides the duets “Ndatenda Ndapida” also has other exciting tracks with touching messages. Other tracks on the album are “Mari Yangu”, “Ndisirei Mweya Mutsvene”, “Rudo”, “Ndine Mubvunzo” and “Hupenyu Ivhiri”. Mafunga said he was honoured to work with Tuku and thanked the musician for his humility. “Mtukudzi is indeed a Superstar. His humility is amazing and not many people would be so humble if they were at his level,” said Mafunga. “I approached him with this project and he agreed to feature and put serious effort in the studio. I feel honoured and I do not have words that can explain my joy. The tracks came out well and they have been received well on the market. “Other tracks on the album are also doing well and I thank God for this album. I have been in the industry for a long time and done some hits but I have confidence this album will surpass all the other. “This is my seventh album and the number ‘seven’ symbolises perfection, and to me this is a perfect piece that God inspired me to record.” Mafunga’s previous albums are “Endai Naizvozvo”, “Fambai Nokutenda”, “Pfuurirai Mberi”, “Ndicharamba Ndichidana”, “Spiritual Battle” and “Zvangu Zvaita”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:18:44.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
