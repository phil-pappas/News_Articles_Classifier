(May 21 - June 20): Intervene before a co-worker makes an enormous mistake. His misreading of the situation could wind up costing you big time.\nCANCER. (June 21 - July 21): Someone who did you wrong wants to make amends. You don't have to be friends, but accepting this person's apology would be a good idea.\nLEO.

(Dec. 21 - Jan. 19): Benevolent Jupiter trines Pluto in your sign. You've gone through hell; now you can reap some of the benefits of heaven.\nAQUARIUS. (Jan. 20 - Feb. 17): You can't do people's emotional homework for them. This is something you will have to accept today when you decide to give a pass or failing grade to a certain relationship.\nPISCES. (Feb. 18 - March 19): People are willing to do all sorts of favors for you thanks to the Jupiter/Pluto trine. Don't hold back with the requests.
