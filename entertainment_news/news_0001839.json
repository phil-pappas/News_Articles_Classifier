The two combatants fought inside the cell structure last night, beating each other to bloody pulps, with one man leaving on both feet and the other being carried backstage. However, it wasn’t medical staff doing the carrying. Other results included Seth Rollins vs. Kane and Nikki Bella taking on Charlotte in divas action.\nAccording to Wrestling Inc in their Oct. 25 report, Brock Lesnar was victorious inside Hell in a Cell against Undertaker Sunday night, but it came after both men drew blood. Early into the match, Lesnar started bleeding profusely from his forehead with a medical staff member from ringside needing to clean him up so he could continue. The match saw both men go to the limits, using steel chairs and the ring steps inside and out of the ring. Ultimately, Lesnar ripped apart the mat inside the ring and was able to survive several Taker finishers to hit an F5 and win.\nIt was the aftermath that has people talking though. Undertaker finally got to his feet after a crowd chant of “Thank you Taker,” but it was short lived as The Wyatt Family made their entrance. That meant all four of the Wyatts, and they came to the ring with the sole purpose of destroying Undertaker. They may have succeeded as Luke Harper, Erick Rowan and Braun Strowman all were led backstage by Bray Wyatt, as they carried Undertaker on top of them as if he was a corpse.\nIn other action, Nikki Bella and Charlotte put on a great Divas Championship match. There were several impressive counters by the divas, with the finish seeing Nikki try for her Rack Attack and Charlotte turning it into a Figure Eight to make her tap. Kevin Owens was victorious over Ryback to retain the Intercontinental Title after managing to kick him in his eye. Also, Seth Rollins got one of his first clean wins in a while, avoiding a chokeslam to hit the Pedigree on Kane. That means Kane gets fired from his job with The Authority on tonight’s episode of Raw.\nWWE Hell in a Cell 2015 results took place at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on Sunday night. Next up for the pro wrestling events will be the Survivor Series pay-per-view in November with rumors already circulating that Undertaker will lead a team of four men against The Wyatt Family.", "external_links": ["http://wwecharacters.blogspot.com/2015/10/wwe-hell-in-cell-2015-results-final.html", "http://wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2015/1025/603090/wwe-hell-in-a-cell-brock-lesnar-vs-the-undertaker-hell-in-a-cell/"], "published": "2015-10-26T16:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:28:48.779+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
