Mrs Muchinguri stated the department would now review how hunting licenses are issued. \"We approached the police and then the Prosecutor General, and it turned out that [Walter] Palmer came to Zimbabwe because all the papers were in order,\" Mrs Muchinguru stated. Palmer's guide, Zimbabwean Theo Bronkhurst's trial is expected to continue on Tuesday; he denies the charge of \"failing to prevent an illegal hunt.\"\nAfter taking two months off from his dental practice, Palmer resumed work in September . He is believed to have paid $50,000 to hunt and kill the lion. Dr. Walter Palmer, 55, stated: \"I have a lot of staff members, and I'm a little heartbroken at the disruption in their lives. And I'm a health professional. I need to get back to my staff and my patients, and they want me back. That's why I'm back .\" Palmer insists he hasn't been in hiding, but said he had been keeping a \"low profile\" for security reasons.\nAnd perhaps the most sickening part of the news comes after Palmer refused to answer what has become of Cecil's body. Public condemnation for the death of Cecil still has tempers running hot and disgust on any measured meter hitting the top of the thermometer. Rest in peace Cecil. The world does miss you.\nFollow the National Pet Rescue Examiner on Facebook.", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-34508269", "https://www.facebook.com/NationalPetRescueExaminer"], "published": "2015-10-12T20:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:00:58.267+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
