In this vision from 2012, Alfred Hitchcock's film Vertigo is named the greatest film of all time, beating Orson Welles in one of Hollywood's longest-running director rivalries.\nPT0M59S http://www.canberratimes.com.au/action/externalEmbeddedPlayer?id=d-23ne8 620 349 August 5, 2012 Autoplay On Off Video feedback Video settings More Big Picture Columns Movie session times Full movies coverage \"Shut the machine off,\" said Alfred Hitchcock, in a room at the Beverly Hills Hotel in the autumn of 1962. The machine was a tape recorder. With him in the room was Francois Truffaut, the brilliant 30-year-old French director of The 400 Blows and Jules and Jim . Helen Scott, who worked at the French Film Office in New York, translated. Truffaut had written an adoring letter, suggesting a series of interviews. They met daily for a week in Los Angeles, where Hitchcock, then 63, was in post-production on The Birds . Truffaut said they did 50 hours of tape.\nFour years later, he published Hitchcock/Truffaut , a transcript of the interviews. It became an instant classic, a fascinating compendium not just of Hitchcock's work but the art of film direction itself.\nJimmy Stewart and Kim Novak in a scene from Vertigo (1958). The film's reputation has grown since the late 1980s and is rated the best film ever made.

One describes it as \"one of the few indispensable books about movies\" and it's hard to disagree.\nAdvertisement \"It completely changed people's ideas about Hitchcock,\" says Peter Bogdanovich in the documentary – which is titled, confusingly, Hitchcock/Truffaut . That redefinition was Truffaut's purpose. The French critics at Cahiers du Cinema had concluded that Hitchcock was an artist rather than simply the greatest craftsman film had ever seen. Even though Hitchcock promoted himself as the latter, he was flattered that a younger generation now championed him as the former.\nOne of the key parts of the discussion in 1962 concerned Vertigo , Hitchcock's 1958 film about a former cop, Scottie Ferguson (Jimmy Stewart), who falls in love with Madeleine (Kim Novak), whom he is being paid to follow. He is devastated when she dies in a fall. In the second half, he finds a similar looking woman working in another part of San Francisco. Judy is a red-head. She falls for him, but he can't love her until he remakes her in Madeleine's image. The audience knows she is the same woman, part of an elaborate murder plot, but Scottie does not.\nAlfred Hitchcock loved to manipulate his film audiences.

Its reputation has only grown since it became available again in the late 1980s. It was always rated highly by those critics who had seen it. It's now rated the best film ever made – ahead of Citizen Kane – in the influential Sight and Sound critics poll, conducted once a decade.\nIn the documentary, we hear clips from the original tapes. Many of these are now available at The Hitchcock Zone website . In 1984, Hitchcock's daughter Patricia donated the original tapes to the Hitchcock collection, held by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences in Los Angeles. Curiously, The Hitchcock Zone says there were only 26 hours in that donation. We don't know if Truffaut exaggerated, or some of the tapes were held back.\nHitchcock describes his interest in the story in two ways. He liked the story of a man trying to remake a woman in the image of one who had died, especially once he decided to let the audience know halfway through that Madeleine and Judy were the same woman. That concentrated the pain of Scottie's longing. \"Now you have a woman who realises that this is a man who is practically unmasking her. But that is the plot side of it. The sex/psychology side is that you have a man creating a sex image; that he can't go to bed with her until he has got her back to the thing he wants to go to bed with. Or metaphorically, [he] indulged in a form of necrophilia. That is what it really was.\"\n\"Oui,\" says Truffaut, mentioning that he loves the scenes where Scottie takes her to buy clothes and shoes, with a maniacal sort of drive.\nHitchcock: \"And the thing you see that I liked and felt most was when she came back from having her hair made blonde, and it wasn't up, this means she has stripped but won't take her knickers off.\"\nBoth Helen Scott and Truffaut chortle at this reference.\n\"When she says all right and she goes into the bathroom, he is waiting – waiting for the woman to undress and come out nude, ready for him.\"\n\n\"Oui, it is beautiful,\" says Truffaut.\nHitchcock: \"That is what it meant. That is what I meant. And while he was standing there looking at that door, he was getting an erection. Like that. We will now tell a story. Shut the machine off.\"\nOMG. You can hear the delight in Hitchcock's voice as he shocks them with this ribaldry. Jimmy Stewart was supposed to have an erection in this scene? Did he know? Did he oblige? Did Hitch tell him what he was thinking? We'll never know. He turned the machine off and no-one has left us a record.\nHitchcock liked to tell dirty stories, but he loved to manipulate audiences. \"I've tried to play the audience like an organ,\" he says in another part of the tapes. That appears to have been his game here, too. He knew people would listen to these tapes years into the future, so he played a little game. And he was right: 35 years after he died, we can only wonder.\nTwitter: @ptbyrnes \n​", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T08:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:34:20.614+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
