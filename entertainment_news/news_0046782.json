Featuring lead vocalist/guitarist Jordan McGraw , drummer Drew Langan and bass guitarist Matt Black , the L.A. based band unveils a high energy song from their forthcoming debut album co-produced by Hundred Handed and Eddie Jackson ; also collaborating with songwriter/producer Mike Green (Paramore, 5 Seconds of Summer) and songwriter The Golden Hippie. Check out the lyric video for \"Love Me Like The Weekend\" here: https://youtu.be/ugzG2CKKFTY . Check out the soundcloud link here: https://soundcloud.com/hundredhandedband .\n\"Love Me Like The Weekend\" is an anthem for having fun and loving every day like it's the weekend. As the lyrics state, \"We Stop Watching Clocks Like It's Saturday…Love me Like The Weekend.\" Says McGraw, \"We were inspired by a fresh start here with our new band, Hundred Handed. The song is about never taking yourself too seriously…Whether you're an adult pretending to sneak out of your parents' house to getting into trouble or a high school kid banging their head against the desk until Saturday comes. EVERY DAY should have a little bit of Saturday in it. We are here to make the weekend permanent!\"\nMcGraw and Langan decided to form HUNDRED HANDED after recording and touring as Stars in Stereo, a four piece active rock band. The band toured the U.S. and Canada opening for such established groups such as Bush, Halestorm, Bullet for My Valentine , The Used and Flyleaf. While McGraw and Langan were thrilled to be in this elite company, they decided that their passion was in pop music, and re-formed as HUNDRED HANDED , along with Black.\nMcGraw, a native of Dallas, Texas , grew up listening to the Beach Boys, Led Zeppelin and Tina Turner collections, as well as Blink-182, Green Day and Daft Punk. L.A. born and raised Langan grew up in Lakewood, California on classic rock, and learned to play the drums to Led Zeppelin's version of the blues classic \"When the Levee Breaks.\" Black, a Detroit, Michigan native who has played in bands everywhere from Michigan to Virginia , was influenced by Metallica, The Beatles and Aerosmith.\nPlans for the forthcoming album are to be announced.\nFor more information please contact:\nROGERS & COWAN\nSandy Friedman\n310/854-8109\nsfriedman@rogersandcowan.com\nLori Lousararian-Hakola\n310/854-8104\nllousararian@rogersandcowan.com\nMaggie Bryant\n310/854-8142\nmbryant@rogersandcowan.com\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151002/273337\n releases/hundred-handed-releases-debut-single-love-me-like-the-weekend-today-on-itunes-and-all-digital-platforms-300153242.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hundred-handed-releases-debut-single-love-me-like-the-weekend-today-on-itunes-and-all-digital-platforms-300153242.html", "https://youtu.be/ugzG2CKKFTY", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "https://soundcloud.com/hundredhandedband", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=LA18320&Transmission_Id=201510020907PR_NEWS_USPR_____LA18320&DateId=20151002", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151002/273337", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151002/273337"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:11:50.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
