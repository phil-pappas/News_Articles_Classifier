Yes, there are still plenty of laughs to be had. For over two decades, Homer remains the focal point for which the series revolves around. He is after all, one of the most dynamic characters in television history, and surprisingly remains one of its funniest. September 29th 2015 16 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/Lifestyle/ \nTHE Simpsons’ showrunner Al Jean says that not only would the long running series have survived the loss of voice actor Harry Shearer — they actually made more than a third of the current season without him. \nShearer, the voice behind Mr Burns, Ned Flanders, Principal Skinner and Kent Brockman, walked earlier this year in a standoff over contract negotiations. Jean isn’t entirely sure why: there was never any question of offering him more money than the other five main cast, and the voice actor’s concern about “the freedom to do other work” didn’t square with the fact he can record his dialogue over the internet. \nIt was a high stakes game of chicken, but Jean says the show was contractually bound to go on. \n“We would have had to replace him if he didn’t sign. \n“There was never even a time where there was a choice whether or not to do the show.” \nIn the end eight episodes were recorded without Shearer. After he relented, they were able to go back and add his characters and voices to the finished programs.
