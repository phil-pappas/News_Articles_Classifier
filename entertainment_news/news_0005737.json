(Photo: Hopper Stone, SMPSP)\n1 CONNECT 34 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE The journey from books to movies isn't always a page-turner.\nSteve Jobs and The Martian opened this month just four years after flying to the top of best-seller lists, while other upcoming adaptations hit rough air in development. USA TODAY reads up on five movies that experienced delays in their page-to-screen transitions:\n'GOOSEBUMPS' (in theaters Friday)\nFirst published: 1992\nWhy the holdup? R.L. Stine's goofy, gory series of more than 60 kids' horror novels has taken two decades to creep to the big screen. Various screenwriters have come and gone through the years, with Tim Burton at one point attached to produce in the late '90s. \"They spent all this time trying to figure out which book to dramatize. 'Which book should we use?' 'Which monster should we base the movie on?' \" Stine told Entertainment Weekly . \"And then somebody had this idea ... to put all the monsters in from the early Goosebumps books and to put me in the movie.\" That's the approach Jack the Giant Slayer screenwriter Darren Lemke has taken with Sony's family adventure, which stars Jack Black as the spooky Stine.\nCate Blanchett and Rooney Mara star in a 1950s New York-based drama in which a young department-store clerk falls for an older, married woman.\n'CAROL' (in select theaters Nov. 20)\nFirst published: 1952\nWhy the holdup? Patricia Highsmith's lesbian romance was a best seller when it published under original title The Price of Salt in the early '50s, and was later reprinted as Carol . Highsmith's friend, playwright Phyllis Nagy, adapted the screenplay more than a decade ago, but the project couldn't muster interest from studios or filmmakers. “Think about the climate 15 years ago for female-driven films that weren’t comedies,\" Nagy told Deadline . \"If the film was a buddy comedy, we’d have a much easier time.\" Carol picked up steam when it landed at the U.K.'s Number 9 Films and Cate Blanchett signed on four years ago to star and executive produce. In 2013, the period drama lured director Todd Haynes (reuniting with Blanchett after 2007's I'm Not There ), who cast Rooney Mara as the twentysomething shop girl who engages Blanchett's conflicted housewife.\nEddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander star in the drama 'The Danish Girl.' Focus Features\n'THE DANISH GIRL' (in select theaters Nov. 27)\nFirst published: 2000\nWhy the holdup? Well before Caitlyn Jenner and Laverne Cox ushered transgender issues into the mainstream, A-listers were being courted to star in this David Ebershoff adaptation, about one of the first people known to undergo gender-reassignment surgery, in 1930. Nicole Kidman was long attached to star as Lili Elbe, a Danish trans woman, while actresses Charlize Theron, Gwyneth Paltrow, Marion Cotillard and Rachel Weisz all were set to play her wife, artist Gerda Wegener, but dropped out. Swedish filmmakers Tomas Alfredson and Lasse Hallström were slated to helm Girl as early as 2009, before The King's Speech director Tom Hooper officially signed on early last year . Oscar best-actor winner Eddie Redmayne ( The Theory of Everything ) and Swedish \"It\" girl Alicia Vikander ( Ex Machina ) star as Lili and Gerda, respectively, and both are considered major awards players.\nA whaling ship becomes stranded at sea for 90 days in the movie 'In the Heart of the Sea.' The film tells the true story that inspired 'Moby-Dick.' VPC\n'IN THE HEART OF THE SEA' (in theaters Dec. 11)\nFirst published: 2000\nWhy the holdup? When Nathaniel Philbrick's historical whaling novel published 15 years ago, the Weinstein Company already was in talks with Barry Levinson ( Sleepers ) to direct. The project stalled, but found its sea legs again in 2012 when Thor 's Chris Hemsworth signed on to star as a sailor whose ship is wrecked after clashing with a sperm whale. (A true story that inspired Herman Melville's Moby-Dick. ) Benedict Cumberbatch, Henry Cavill and Tom Hiddleston all were considered for the film , according to Variety , and Ron Howard came aboard as director in 2013. Initially set for release in March, Heart was pushed back to December, which Howard justified to The Hollywood Reporter , saying, \"I do feel like it’s more of that fourth quarter, early winter kind of feel in terms of the tone of the movie.\"\n'The Revenant' stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a man seeking vengeance after being left for dead. 20th Century Fox\n'THE REVENANT' (in select theaters Dec. 25)\nFirst published: 2002\nWhy the holdup? Leonardo DiCaprio's grim, gritty turn as a 19th-century fur trapper is arguably this awards season's biggest question mark, much as Michael Punke's book was when it was snapped up for a film adaptation . Bought by Warner Bros. in 2001 as an unpublished manuscript, the revenge tale was going to be directed by Oldboy 's Chan-wook Park and star Samuel L. Jackson; and later, Christian Bale, with filmmaker John Hillcoat ( The Road ), as ScreenRant.com reported in 2010. Birdman 's Oscar-winning director Alejandro González Iñárritu swooped in the next year and DiCaprio officially committed to the project last year — enduring a taxing shoot in remote locations of Canada. A crew member summed up the experience as \"a living hell\" to The Hollywood Reporter .\n1 CONNECT 34 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE //usat.ly/1RILhmF TOP VIDEOS", "external_links":
