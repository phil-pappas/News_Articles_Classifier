The studio had previously raised $8 million in 2012.

It is indistinguishable from magic. That's why we raised this money. Because the most important growth opportunity our industry has ever experienced is starting now.\"\nPlayful is the creator of Lucky's Tale, the wildly popular character action game designed exclusively for virtual reality.

With the new funding, Playful will aggressively expand these internal development teams and also fund new, original projects.\n\"We're inspired by Snow White, by Toy Story, by Mario,\" Bettner said. \"These beloved stories and characters share something in common: technology made them possible.
