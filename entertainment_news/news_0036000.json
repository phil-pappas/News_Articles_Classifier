Chin had said it would be difficult for anyone to read any of the works in their entirety by repeatedly entering different search requests. \nIn an opinion written by Judge Pierre N. Leval, the appeals court agreed, saying the snippet feature “substantially protects against its serving as an effectively competing substitute for plaintiffs’ books.” \nThe three-judge appeals panel did acknowledge, though, that some book sales likely would be lost if someone were merely searching for a portion of text to ascertain a fact. \nThe Authors Guild and various authors had challenged Google in 2005, contending that the digital book project violated their rights.
