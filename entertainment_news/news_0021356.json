And it was just awkward. And the next take, I just did it again and then she didn't slap me. She didn't slap me then. We had a good time.\" \nDespite the \"awkward\" incident, the 35-year-old actor believes he and his now-fiancee had \"chemistry\" from their first meeting, revealing they started dating soon afterwards. \nSpeaking on 'Watch What Happens Live', he said: \"I think there was chemistry. It was a late shoot. We were shooting until four or five in the morning. We exchanged information. A few weeks went by and we kept in touch and then that's that.\" \nThe couple got engaged in February this year but haven't started planning their wedding or even set a date yet. \nTaylor said: \"We're so busy. We've been engaged for less than a year. So, we've been talking about whether it's New York, Los Angeles, destination place so we don't have an exact date yet.\" bang showbiz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:33:00.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
