Lapwood built a homemade flamethrower from a nailgun and glowplug from an engine to ignite the butane canister he'd attached.\nLapwood, who's a second year Philosophy and Pyschology student, thought it wasn't dangerous at all. \"I used it for about ten minutes, and it's not as though I set any of my friends on fire. I used it well away from anyone, I never took it inside and I dismantled it after I used it.\"\nAlthough nobody was injured, the party was shut down by college officials shortly after Lapwood used the flamethrower. The flamethrower was part of his costume, in which he wore a Space Invaders symbol over his shirt. The joke being that he was Arcade Fire.\nGood one, Inigo.
