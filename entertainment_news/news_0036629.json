Snyder is \"completely wrong.\"\nSnyder ruled that the nephew of Egyptian composer Baligh Hamdi didn't have the proper authority to sue Jay Z over the 1999 hit song, which partially uses Hamdi's 1957 song \"Khosara Khosara.\" The judge told jurors she was basing her ruling on testimony about Egyptian law that was presented during a weeklong trial.\nAttorneys for Jay Z and producer Timbaland say they are pleased with the ruling.
