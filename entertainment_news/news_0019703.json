His celebratory return to show business already included a stop by \"Saturday Night Live\" last week. And he just stopped by \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" to show off a recent big purchase â€” the Bronx Zoo. \n\"What's the difference between a bison and a buffalo?\" Jimmy Kimmel asked on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live.\" \n\"They don't make bison spicy hot wings, they make buffalo wings,\" Tracy Morgan said. \nApparently, owning a zoo doesn't exactly make you a zoologist. Tracy did have some interesting facts about the animals' diets, though. \n\"What do they eat?\" Guillermo asked. \n\"Some of them eat Big Mac meals, and a lot of them like White Castle,\" Tracy said. \n\"They eat White Castle?\" Jimmy asked. \n\"Yeah. This one right here is from the West Coast, so he loves Fatburgers,\" Tracy said. \nHe should probably just stick to comedy. \nThis video includes images from Getty Images.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T15:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:30:32.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
