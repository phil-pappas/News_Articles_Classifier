READ MORE: \nDespite getting the first ‘10’ of the series just one week ago , the judging panel admitted that they’d been left disappointed by Jay’s Quickstep to The Who’s ‘My Generation’. \nDarcey Bussell admitted she thought his shaky performance was “such a shame” due to his previous success, adding: “This was going to be your dance again but with all those mistakes... You lost your balance.” \nUnfortunately for Jay, his routine failed to impress \nLen Goodman agreed, claiming: “Your feet were doing more than your brain could handle. You need to work on eliminating these mistakes.” \nTogether, Jay and his professional partner, Aliona Vilani, earned just 25 points, making them among the lowest-scorers on the evening. \nViewers had previously complained that Jay’s high scores were due to him having had dance training when he was a teenager, though former ‘Strictly’ contestant Frankie Bridge, who suffered similar criticism during her time on the show, recently stuck up for the former boy band singer . \nStory continues after video… \nMeanwhile, the surprise high scorers of the night were Katie Derham and Anton du Beke , whose Viennese Waltz had the judges gushing about their performance. \nA third couple will be eliminated on Sunday night’s show, with Jeremy Vine currently at the bottom of the ‘Strictly’ leaderboard, earning just 20 points for his Jive to Bobby Darin’s ‘Splish Splash’. \nFind out who’ll be the next pair to leave the dance floor in Sunday’s ‘Strictly’ elimination, at 7.15pm on BBC One. Close 'Strictly Come Dancing': The Most Memorable Awkward Moments of   From the second Russell stepped out of the giant shell, this was always going to be a disaster... Who can possibly forget the moment when Anton unceremoniously dragged Ann across the 'Strictly' dancefloor? A canon. A. Canon. Poor Chelsee was left in tears after a wardrobe malfunction forced her to take a short pause to readjust her outfit. Because it's not just the celebs who can be dragged around the room... Ann really was the gift that kept on giving, wasn't she? It's not just the dancers who can embarrass themselves, y'know! Mark and Karen were forced to restart their performance after their over-enthusiastic salsa moves somehow resulted in Mark's microphone becoming tangled in Karen's dress. Lisa and Brendan's freestyle displays the skill and finesse required to do well in the competition - but, the opening part where he picks her up is more than a little awkward, isn't it? Let's start with the mesh vest. Wow. Then there's the cringey shimmying too. Oh, Mark... The King and Queen of Cringey 'Strictly' moments unite for one of the most umm, memorable routines ever. After some intense spinning, Pamela staggers across the dancefloor and spending the rest of the routine trying to suppress the giggles.  Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T10:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T11:14:08.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
