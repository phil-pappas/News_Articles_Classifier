Are they right to demonstrate, protest, and in some cases get violent, until their education becomes more affordable, possibly even free?\nThe idea of free university education is a complex one, with so many angles to consider.\n- Who is responsible for educating the youth?\n- Who should provide the funding?\n- Who should be entitled to go to a university?\n- Should universities be private institutions or state run?\nLet’s address each of these points:\nThe first key question is one of responsibility for education of the youth. Is it the governments’ responsibility to educate the nation or is it the responsibility of oneself and ones' family? This is a fundamental question at the heart of the demonstrations. Quite clearly, these kids and their parents (given some parents are joining in the demonstrations) feel that the government is responsible for their university education.\nThe notion that the state is responsible for your education is a very socialist / communist one – the fact that I pay my taxes means you owe me an education in return.\nThe second question is one of funding. Currently our universities are not state owned or run - thank goodness for that else they’d be a complete mess; they are private institutions funded through fees, donations and bequests. Fees are made by individuals themselves, bursaries or scholarships and sometimes with the assistance of the government.\nWith these students protesting for free education, who is going to fund it? It can only be the government which means it can only be funded through taxes. With such a narrow tax base, it’s rather unfair in the short term on these tax payers to fund so many kids university education, however that’s perhaps a short-sighted view : educating our children well will mean growing the economy and widening the tax base.\nThe third question is one of who should attend a “free” university. Given the financial constraint is removed, it becomes a question of who qualifies and who does not. Let me put it out there : not every matriculant should be allowed to go to university paid for by the public. No. If you could not put in the hard yards during your schooling career and get good grades, or achieve in sport, you don’t deserve to go to university.\nYou’re likely to fail. And to help ensure you pass, given you’re not an A-student will you later demonstrate for the universities to lower the passing criteria? I would suggest that the government already lowered to the matric pass marks to ridiculously low levels. I guarantee you that we already have academically stupid kids with a matric certificate. A worthless piece of paper. We have already seen the government pressure universities to let in kids who ordinarily would not qualify based on their grades. We have already seen universities turning away academic high achievers in favour of low achievers.\nWe have already seen universities bemoan the fact they have to take in students who are border-line illiterate. So right now, we know that universities have students who really should not be there. The failure rates are already sky-high – and when it’s free what’s to say you’ll put in the effort required to pass, since you’ve no real skin in the game?\nIf university education is made free, the government should confirm that university is for top achievers, it’s a place for higher learning, that the requirements to quality for university are tough, and that should you fail, you need to pay back those fees.\nMy fourth key point is whether universities should be state run or private. Since they are currently private, the student protests on campus are misplaced. These people should be demonstrating outside the ANC headquarters or outside the Union Buildings – since they’re effectively asking the government to fund them.\nI guess in reality they don’t know who they’re demonstrating against – I think they’re demonstrating for the Universities to fund them, but that really serves to show they’re not the brightest kids and don’t quite understand how the system works. I dare say, these kids protesting are probably not ideal university material, probably not the kids you’d want working for your company anyway. State-run universities are a great idea, as long as the state is able to run them effectively. Our government is far from being able to run effective universities, as all our failed SOEs demonstrate. Failed universities would really mean a failed economy over time.\nThe most concerning fact about these demonstrations is this notion of “entitlement”. We have a bunch of kids and their parents who feel entitled to a free university education. It started with them feeling entitled to get entrance to a university when we know many of them are not academic achievers, kids with a university entrance based on a worthless matric certificate and lowered entrance criteria based on your race. Do they feel entitled to pass? Will they demonstrate for lowered pass rates? Will they feel entitled to get a guaranteed job later?\nIf they don’t find employment will they demonstrate yet again? And once they are employed, will they feel entitled to get a high salary from the start, and get a promotion every year? And if they don’t, will they again demonstrate? It might seem far-fetched but this generation is the entitlement generation – they want everything handed to them on a silver platter, they don’t want to work hard and they want everything now. It’s a fact. So where and when do we teach them the hard lessons in life – perhaps now is the right time for them to learn the harsh realities of a capitalist world.\nThe last point I want to make, is really the elephant in the room. Our economy is shite, and has been for years. Whilst it has grown in the past 10 years we’ve not created nearly enough jobs for the educated youth of today. So even if all these demonstrating kids get their free university education, and get their degrees, there are no jobs in the market for them. They are all fighting for an opportunity at the university level right now, but it’s not going to get them a job. The funnel effect is too great right now with little end in sight.\nSo using our taxes to cover free university education is a complete waste of taxpayer funds until the government succeeds in stimulating the economy. Without jobs being created these kids are as useless to society as someone with a matric certificate or no schooling at all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:09:56.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
