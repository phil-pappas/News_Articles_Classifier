Staab/CBS It seems Britney Spears was a hit with the cast of The CW’s Jane the Virgin . The show’s star Gina Rodriguez tells HuffPost Live what it was like working with the pop star. \n\"She is so incredible,” Gina says. “You can tell she just wanted to be there. 'Cause she was light, and love and giving, and it's a great episode. It's so good.\" \nShe says Britney got to show off her sense of humor in the role, and held her own with the other actors. \"I mean, you can tell she's got comedy chops. Like nobody's business,\" Gina says. \nThe two even got to dance together in one scene. \"I won't even tell you why or in what capacity … I'm just a better person because of it,\" Gina says. \nOn Monday, Gina posted a goofy selfie of her and Brit, and says she still can’t stop looking at it. \"I swear I go back to that freaking picture so often 'cause I'm like, ‘This happened!'\" she says. \nBritney will be guest starring on an episode of season two as the “nemesis” of Rogelio de la Vega, who plays Jane’s biological father on the show. Jane the Virgin ’s second season premieres October 12 at 9 p.m. on The CW. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:59:59.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
