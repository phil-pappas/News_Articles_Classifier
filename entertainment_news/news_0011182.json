The Palm Houston revives the power lunch 1 / 6 Back to Gallery The power lunch is not dead. It still lives in clubby places like the Palm Houston Restaurant , 6100 Westheimer, which recently began a new three-course \"power lunch\" menu that includes a starter, entrée (with individual side) and dessert for $25.90.\nThe Palm's lunch includes a choice of starter (mixed green salad, Caesar salad, soup of the day), choice of entrée (chicken parmigiana, Atlantic salmon fillet, fish special of the day, filet mignon medallions), choice of single portion side (half fries/half fried onions, vegetable of the day, linguine marinara), and choice of dessert (New York style cheesecake, flourless chocolate cake).\nOf course if you want to turn your day into a three-martini lunch, that's available too. But you're on your own.", "external_links": ["http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/40/26/8783284/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/40/26/8783284/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/31/06/24/6579468/11/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/22/50/00/4882478/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/22/50/00/4882479/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://www.thepalm.com/Houston", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/40/27/8783299/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/40/27/8783297/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/22/50/00/4882478/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/40/27/8783299/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/40/27/8783297/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/22/50/00/4882479/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/31/06/24/6579468/11/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-13T20:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:10:17.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
