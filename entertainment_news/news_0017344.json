Magazine/PA) \nShe added: “When you go out with a sportsman, it’s part of the territory.” \nCamilla, 27, told the magazine: “There have been times when I’ve felt a bit trapped in my own house. \n“Just recently, because of the rugby, photographers have been waiting to capture a picture of me looking downcast. When they ask me to look sad, I give them a dazzling smile.” Camilla with partner Chris Robshaw (Arthur Mola/Invision) \nRobshaw sparked controversy when he rejected a late, potentially equalising penalty chance in favour of an attacking lineout when Wales won 28-25 at Twickenham in the Rugby World Cup. \nCamilla said: “The team is behind him too and the fans have been incredible. The outpouring of support and love from them has been overwhelming. I want to thank the England fans for being so kind.” The latest issue of Hello! (Hello! Magazine/PA) \nWhen asked how Robshaw is bearing up, she said: “As can be expected, unfortunately. It’s a bit too close for him to talk about it yet, but when he’s ready, he knows I’m here. \n“We always have and always will be supportive of each other. The only way a good relationship works is through honesty, support and kindness.” Share article \nRead the full article in Hello!, out now.
