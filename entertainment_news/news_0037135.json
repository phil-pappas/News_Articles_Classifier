I have accomplished nothing without a little taste of fear in my mouth,\" she says. \nBeyonce also reveals that in the shower she sings \"Holy Ghost\" by Kim Burrell, she's down with Netflixl, Fetty Wap’s \"Jugg\" is stuck in her head and that she puts extra tomato sauce and jalapeños on her pizza. \nThe BEAT winter issue, which includes a photo spread shot by Ryan McGinley, will be out October 21. \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
