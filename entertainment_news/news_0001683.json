London is preparing for the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping, accompanied by his wife Peng Liyuan starting on Monday Oct. 19. \nLONDON (AP) - Chinese President Xi Jinping is set to begin a four-day state visit to Britain to emphasize growing trade ties between the two countries. \nThe president and his wife arrive Monday evening and will stay at Buckingham Palace as guests of Queen Elizabeth II and her husband Prince Philip. \nXi plans to make an unusual address to both houses of Parliament and will meet with Prime Minister David Cameron and Prince Charles. \nHis trip follows a high profile visit to China by Treasury chief George Osborne, who seeks more Chinese investment for Britain. \nProtests are expected throughout Xi's visit, which is scheduled to end Friday. British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn has indicated a desire to discuss human rights with Xi when they meet at a palace banquet. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
