I was asked if I had to do a biopic then on which person it would be, I gave this name (Pakistani singer Nazia Hasan) as it was on top of my mind. I found the story and subject interesting,\" Alia said at a promotional event of her upcoming film \"Shaandaar\".\n\nShe was speaking at the launch of a new song \"Raitaa Phail Gaya\" from the film. Director Vikas Bahl said he had a great time watching noted actor Pankaj Kapur dance to the song.\n\n\"When we started to make him dance then it was difficult to stop him. We were waiting for him to stop. He was fab. The unit was on floor looking at him,\" he said.\nShahid, who is for the first time sharing screen space with actor-father Pankaj Kapur, has no dancing scenes with him.\n\n\"The situation in the song is when I am around he is not dancing. We have 'tashan' in the film. When I go away he dances alone as he also wants to dance. I did not get chance to dance with him,\" Shahid said.\n\nAt the event, Shahid also came to the rescue of Alia when reporters asked her if she had seen pictures posted by her rumoured boyfriend Siddharth Malhotra on social networking sites regarding New Zealand tourism, of which he is the brand ambassador in India.\nTo this Alia said, \"Shahid I always rescue you, today you rescue me.\"\n\nHer \"Shaandaar\" co-star then go up and said, \"Who is Siddharth, we don't know any Siddharth. In New Zealand we don't know any Siddharth. There is Sid (Siddharth) Marketing. He handles marketing of Dharma Productions. Apart from him we don't know any Siddharth.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:10:01.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
