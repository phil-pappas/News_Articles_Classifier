We are now in the twenty-second season of what started as The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers back in the fall of 1993. The episode airing tomorrow, \"Sync or Swim,\" is also the 800th overall Power Rangers episode that has aired since August 28th, 1993. Both of my older kids are interested. My four-year-old son has become something of a Power Rangers junkie over the last few months. I mean \"hardcore,\" as it he is dressing up as the \"Gold Ranger\" for Halloween and is slowly filling out home with Power Rangers toys and assorted goodies of a morphing and/or mighty variety. And he's probably not alone.You might think that this is another passive aggressive discussion about the Power Rangers franchise and why I somewhat hated it when I was a teenager. But no, having done something of a mini-binge of Power Rangers episodes over the past few months, with the newer stuff along with the very oldest of options ( Netflix has a ton of the of the seasons available), I think I finally get it now. And yeah, unless they screw it up on a Fantastic Four -level, I think Lions Gate Entertainment has a pretty huge hit on their hands come January 13th, 2017. As evidenced by the copious merchandise found in any toy store and the mere fact that it's about to air its 800th episode, the Power Rangers brand is almost as strong as ever among the core demographic.Like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles property, it's the very kind of ongoing property that catches new young fans right as the current crop ages out. Ironically, it's now positioned and has been positioned for a very long time, as precisely what Walt Disney wants their Star Wars empire to become. When one generation grows out of it, the next crop of kids is ready to get addicted to whatever the newest incarnation happens to be. And if the movie version, debuting in January of 2017, can pull off a similar trick, well then Lionsgate may have its first truly ongoing franchise that doesn't have a literary expiration date.As we get through the next month of 007-related posts leading up to Spectre 's release, something hear a lot from me is the notion that the 007 franchise, for at least the first big chunk of its existence, was basically the only game in town. During the 1960's and most of the 1970's, the stunts, explosions, international locations, and related big-budget spectacle found in the James Bond franchise was basically the only game in town. I'll argue the same thing regarding the special effects space opera known as the Star Wars franchise, as it too was wholly unique unto itself in terms of the kinds of cinematic thrills that it offered at least until the end of the last prequel trilogy. And if you are young enough, Power Rangers might just qualify as such for you.When the Power Rangers premiered in 1993, I was already thirteen years old. I was already able to see whatever mainstream live-action adventure shows and blockbuster movies that Hollywood had to offer. So as a thirteen year old kid thrilling to both older kid/adult entertainment and also geeking out over Batman: The Animated Series and Animaniacs , Mighty Morphin Power Rangers felt like a huge step back into the late-80's/early 90's dark ages of Pro Stars, COPS, and the Super Mario Bros. Super Show (no, I will not \"do the Mario,\" so do not even ask). But watching the show through my four-year old's eyes, I realized something. If you're four-years-old, and you aren't old enough to see non-animated action movies, CW superhero shows, or PG-13 fantasy tentpoles, then Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is probably the most spectacular thing you've ever seen.It is a brightly colored mishmash of kid-friendly teen melodrama, martial arts, super heroics, and scenes of giant monsters being taken down by giant robots. Hmm... maybe Pacific Rim should have gone for a PG back in 2013 or maybe it should have trimmed its budget by using footage from Japanese action shows. But anyway, it is reasonable to assume that the core audience is kids (boys and girls) too young for live-action fantasy shows but wanting a bit of flesh-blood adventure mixed in with their cartoons. To that audiences, not only may an episode of Power Rangers be the coolest thing they've ever seen by virtue of it being the only game in town, it may well prove to be tantamount to a kid's first fantasy show, a gateway drug to the likes of The Flash or Buffy the Vampire Slayer and the related live-action theatrical blockbusters.Comparing the oldest episodes with the newest stuff, I will concede that the show as a whole significantly improved. Walt Disney actually bought the property from Saban in 2001. While the Mouse House didn't do much with it (they were reluctant to market it under the Walt Disney brand due to focus group concerns about the martial arts violence) and actually sold it back to Saban in 2010 , the Disney purchase resulted in production being moved from America to New Zealand. The acting got better, as did the writing and the martial arts choreography (the material not borrowed from Super Sentai episodes). Considering it is shot and edited with an emphasis on comprehension, the fight scenes play better than any number of shaky camera/hyper-edit action films from the last ten years or so.In an era when we are all talking about gender/ethnic diversity in mainstream entertainment, the Power Rangers franchise has been intentionally doing the whole \"at least two women and a glorified rainbow coalition of racial and ethnic representation\" thing for twenty-two years. Pretty much every Power Ranger squad had at least two females and a varying ethnic makeup that would embarrass most other fantastical franchises. And since this was an episodic TV show without any real \"lead Ranger,\" none of these characters were token minority sidekicks or token women but (depending on the episode focus) stars in their own right. It was the kind of thing that was worthwhile in 1993 but sadly is still relatively noteworthy in 2015.I am not going to go so far as to say that it's \"good,\" but I have been somewhat entertained by this latest batch of episodes and the sampling of seasons past that I've stumbled upon over the last few months. But I am wise enough in my old age not to belittle those who loved it back in the 1990's, and to embrace the fact that my kids enjoy it today. Or maybe I got spoiled as my son got really into Power Rangers: Dino Thunder , which is allegedly the best season of the show , and I'm now foolish enough to presume that many of the seasons were at least as \"not that bad\" as the last few seasons I've sampled here and there.Yes, it is not a \"new\" property specially created in the last few years, but nor is it a rehashed/recycled reboot built upon generational nostalgia. It's just that the show never really stopped making new episodes, just like The Simpsons or Sesame Street . And judging from the toy stores I've visited, the property is as popular as ever. The closest two Toys R Us stores have two full columns of Power Rangers toys, and allegedly they tend to sell pretty briskly. By the way, fun anecdote, apparently the new Star Wars toys are selling like hotcakes, but mostly from adults, not kids. If for no other reasons than its longevity, including a few brushes with near-cancellation over the decades, the Power Rangers brand deserves a token amount of respect.So yeah, I'm officially done complaining about the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers . It only took me 22 years and 800 episodes, but I should have pushed aside my adolescent grumpiness about the show years ago. It is beyond ironic that said show has become not only my son's favorite entertainment property but also the rare TV show that my four-year-old son and my eight-year-old daughter can agree upon. But for the appropriate age group, it is exciting and glorious for the same reason that audiences thrilled to James Bond in the 1960's, Star Wars in the 1980's, and Batman in the 1990's. My son is absolutely psyched for the big budget Power Rangers movie. And, in a skewed fashion, I may be too. Happy 800th episode, Power Rangers .", "external_links": ["http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/power-rangers/243231/power-rangers-ranking-all-21-seasons/page/0/1", "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/business/media/13saban.html"], "published": "2015-10-02T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:41:37.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
