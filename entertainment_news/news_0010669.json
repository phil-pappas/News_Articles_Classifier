Dumaplin\nOctober 9, 2015 Piolo Pascual is passionate about running primarily because he wants to stay fit.\n“We only have one life to live, and that’s enough reason… that we should be motivated enough to live our lives to the fullest,” said Piolo at a recent press conference. “For some people kasi, ang exercise is a chore. But if you think of it as part of your lifestyle, it doesn’t become a chore, so hindi siya mahirap gawin.”\nPiolo and Iñigo Pascual (Instagram)\nFor Piolo, keeping fit is what enables him to enjoy the luxuries in life.\nHe said, “’Yan ’yung privilege at kagandahan ng pagkakaroon ng pamumuhay na malusog at walang bisyo. Kumbaga maraming advantages, mas maraming benefits.”\nHe acknowledged being inspired by his son, actor Iñigo Pascual.\n“It is because of him that I want to live life to the fullest.”\nIt goes both ways, with Iñigo also getting into the sport. “I told him kasi na, ‘You’re not young forever, you will also grow old.’ I encouraged him to start young, as early as now, that he’s still a teenager para mas ma-set na ’yung mind niya and ’yung katawan niya,” Piolo said.\nThe actor has also encouraged most of his friends to live a healthy lifestyle. “Basta anything that I do, like badminton, I invite them (friends) to join me so they will realize the benefits of living healthy,” he said.\nIñigo, Matteo Guidicelli, Enchong Dee, Rayver Cruz, Ejay Falcon, Diego Loyzaga, JC de Vera, Kaye Abad and Jason Gainza will join SunPIOLOgy, a run-for-a-cause event which Piolo is spearheading with the help of Sun Life.\n“This is our little way to help promote awareness how to fight diabetes,” Piolo shared.\nWE RUN, WE BOND\nHe and Iñigo bond through worthy causes they both support. Piolo admitted as Iñigo reaches adulthood, it has become harder for them to find time to spend with each other.\n“Pareho kasi kaming busy with work so ang hirap. Ang nangyayari, nag-aantayan kami so minsan sinasabi ko sa kanya, ‘Buti na lang may ‘ASAP’ at Sun Life tayo, buti na lang may trabaho tayo na puwede tayo magkasama’.”\nThanks to events like SunPIOLOgy, father and son are closer than ever. “I always cherish the times that he opens up to me, shares his thoughts about work, about his life… I consider that priceless.”\nLOVE AT BAY\nAt 38 years old, many want to see Piolo settle down. However, he said he is taking his sweet time when it comes to that.\nPiolo cleared he is “not running away” from the idea of marriage, but for now, career is his top priority. “I’m just not in the position to be in a relationship right now because I don’t wanna let opportunities that come my way pass. ’Pag tumanda tayo, hindi na pareho ’yung mga offers so I’m just taking advantage of it.”\nHe is aware, though, time must soon come for him to take the plunge – well, as soon as he finds new love.\n“I also wanna be practical. I’ll be 40 (years old) in years time, so I’m really looking forward to settling down – smell the flowers and slow down in my career. And hopefully, I’ll have time for it when it comes.”\nBecause of his active lifestyle, Piolo is open to the idea of dating someone who is also into sports. “Gusto ko din s’yempre ’yung mahilig sa workout, mag-exercise at tumakbo. Kasi ’yun talaga ’yung hilig ko eh,” he said.\nThe SunPIOLOgy Run happens on Nov. 28. Interested parties can register via sunpiology.com. (With report from Jojo P.
