Naomie Harris is very happy to leave the stunts to Bond in Spectre \nPress Association 2014 / / National Entertainment News Share \nNaomie Harris admitted she was glad to see Moneypenny behind a desk in Spectre – because she hated her training for Skyfall. \nThe actress worked out five times a week with a personal trainer for her role as field agent Eve Moneypenny as well as combat training and stunt driving. Naomie Harris was “very happy” not to be training for Spectre (Jasin Boland/PA) \nShe said director Sam Mendes had to reassure her the same level of training wouldn’t be required for her desk-bound return in the sequel. \n“I was very happy not to be doing all that training. Sam (Mendes) actually told me there’s no training so he knows me really well. He knows us all really well – he knows Ben (Whishaw) likes to get out and be part of the action and I’d rather not, to be honest,” she admitted. \nNaomie spoke alongside Ben ahead of the release of Spectre on Monday and he too admitted he was completely unlike his young gadget guru character Q in the franchise. Ben, who plays Q, says he’s a technology “luddite” in real life (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc./PA) \n“That’s all acted. I don’t know anything about computers or technology. I’m hopeless really. I’m a luddite,” he confessed of the hi-tech role. Promoted stories \nHe said getting out of the office for his action sequences “was brilliant, it was fantastic. I was excited to take the character there.” \nTalking about who could be the successor to Daniel Craig’s Bond, Ben revealed the Spectre gang had once spent the night discussing that very question. \n“We discussed this one night at 4am and Naomie said the role normally goes to somebody unknown. Daniel wasn’t particularly well known – very revered actor but was not a huge international star – so I suspect it would be good if it was someone like that who’s just under the radar a bit at the moment.” Turns out the Spectre cast also discuss Bond rumours (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios /PA) \nNaomie was quick to rule out a promotion for her character to the next 007. \n“I think Moneypenny could do with more power in the decision-making part of things but no action, thanks. We’ve got an M, but working more alongside him.” \nThe pair said they both felt more relaxed coming into Spectre after the success of Skyfall, which Naomie found “incredibly intimidating” to film. \n“The first time, meeting everybody, all these new faces on set and feeling the weight of this huge franchise on your shoulders, is incredibly intimidating. When you’re invited back, it means somebody likes what you’ve done and you feel a lot more relaxed,” she said. Skyfall was the Bond franchise’s biggest success (Sony Pictures/Francois Duhamel) \nBen agreed and said, “Weirdly, we both felt more relaxed. We both felt much more relaxed although, thinking about it, maybe we shouldn’t have because the last film was so successful. \n“I felt like I knew what I was doing more. Not winging it – maybe a bit – but hoping for the best, and it was also new and you don’t know how people will receive you or go with you and they did, so I felt more confident.” Ben said Judi Dench was greatly missed on the Spectre set (Francois Duhamel/PA) \nOne face who was sorely missed on set is Judi Dench, whose character was killed at the end of Skyfall. Share article \n“She was amazing. It’s a shame not to have her,” Ben lamented.
