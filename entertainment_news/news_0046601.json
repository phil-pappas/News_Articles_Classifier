Wright Museum of African American History. Inductees include Aretha Franklin, Martha Reeves, The Miracles, The Spinners, Jimmy Ruffin, Melba Moore and Ray Charles.\nOrganizers call this the “second half” of 2015’s induction ceremony. The first was held in June in Clarksdale, Mississippi.\nThe organization is seeking a permanent home and looking at potential sites in Detroit. Officials also have considered primary or “satellite” sites elsewhere, including Clarksdale.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
