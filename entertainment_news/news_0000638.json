But when a team clinches a playoff spot, all that noise goes out the window. In Toronto Wednesday night, it was thrown off the Space Needle.\nWith a 15-2 win over the Orioles, the Blue Jays clinched the AL West and went bananas. Perhaps that's what happens when you break a 22-year playoff drought. Or when you represent an entire country. Or when your team is so dominant over the course of the season that positive vibes surround you. Or maybe it's all that.\nNot that any of the players were thinking about this on Wednesday night. They were too busy strapping on their ski goggles and spaying beer in each other's faces. By the way, when you have to strap on ski goggles before spraying beer in each other's faces, you know things have gotten out of hand.\nDavid Price soaks up the postgame celebrations after Blue Jays clinch AL East. #PhotoOfTheNight pic.twitter.com/FXSlAluEKg\n— SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) October 1, 2015 How out of hand? Just ask Josh Donaldson.\nJosh Donaldson really enjoyed Toronto's celebration (via @BlueJayHunter ): http://t.co/PqYHQjDLHR https://t.co/p51TBNeTS0\n— SB Nation (@SBNation) October 1, 2015 Don't ask Marcus Stroman, though.

Just be sure to ask him in Japanese, because, well, we'll let him say it.\nBlue Jays infielder Munenori Kawasaki knows how to celebrate a division title http://t.co/9qbiNoFr6a https://t.co/igvlG3n2Av\n— SB Nation MLB (@SBNationMLB) October 1, 2015 And we'll also let him leave you with this parting dance.\nMoves like Muni. @Budweiser #OwnOctober pic.twitter.com/0qw9XFpyTS\n— MLB (@MLB) October 1, 2015 The Blue Jays next game begins at noon on Thursday, which means the buckets of champagne in the clubhouse last night will be replaced by buckets of Advil this afternoon.
