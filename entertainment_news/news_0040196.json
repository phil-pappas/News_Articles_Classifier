Mr. Boehner, a devout Catholic, had invited the pope to speak, and was clearly moved by the pope’s presence. Mr. Boehner’s emotions are always near the surface, and he was particularly affected when Pope Francis, in a private moment, asked Mr. Boehner to pray for him.\nDuring the pope’s address, he said “… A good political leader is one who, with the interests of all in mind, seizes the moment in a spirit of openness and pragmatism. A good political leader always opts to initiate processes rather than possessing spaces.”\nPerhaps Mr. Boehner was thinking of the pope’s excellent guidance when he resigned the next day. He accelerated his plan to resign at the end of the year to avoid turmoil within his Republican Caucus due to a threat to replace him.\nWith the interests of all in mind, he seized the moment rather than possessing space.\nActing on conservative principle rather than expediency is a trademark of Mr. Boehner. A dedicated legislator, he knows the purpose of Congress is to make laws to improve the country. He attempted to negotiate the difficult and necessary “grand bargain” with President Obama to balance the budget. That effort was unsuccessful due to failure on both sides: Mr. Obama moved the goal posts, and Mr. Boehner couldn’t deliver enough Republican votes.\nThis was a courageous attempt by Mr. Boehner, while his Republican colleagues and the White House retreated.\nHe disdains those who use their platform in Congress for personal ideological campaigns and individual aggrandizement. He speaks his mind, and famously referred to Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz as a “[filtered word]” for Cruz’s 2013 role in coercing House Republicans to mount a suicidal attempt to defund Obamacare.\nThe Republican far right is constantly dissatisfied with Mr. Boehner because they blame him for not reaching their ideological objectives. They do not take responsibility for their overreach, and won’t accept that our government is based on compromise —no one gets 100 percent of what they want. In their fervor, they ignore the political reality they face: there is a Democrat in the White House, and it takes 60 votes to get difficult legislation through the Senate.\nRationally, the far right should be working to change these political facts of life. They should be building political support for their goals by trying to elect more Republican Senators and a Republican President. But in their own alternate universe, they do just the opposite. They alienate Hispanics, the most rapidly growing voting bloc, by refusing necessary immigration reform. They would risk default and downgrade of federal debt by not increasing the debt limit. They would embrace the expense and disruption of a government shutdown to demonstrate their childish frustration.\nThese tantrums alienate the political moderates whose support they need. But in a selfish political calculation, grandstanding for arch conservatives in their safely gerrymandered home districts has little political risk. It is easier to shout and complain then forge effective legislation.\nBefore the 2014 election, Mr. Boehner said Republicans would complete immigration reform because the nation can’t have 12 million people constantly looking over their shoulder. He also said Republicans would propose a viable alternative to Obamacare.\nUnfortunately, Mr. Boehner was unable to do either due to resistance within Republican ranks.\nI don’t always agree with John Boehner, but he is one of the adults in our dysfunctional Congress. In a sharp contrast with his antagonists, he has worked realistically within our political system to advance the conservative agenda.\nWe will do well if his successor conducts himself in the same principled way.\nEd Conant is a retired Naval officer who lives and writes in Savannah.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-05T17:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:32:32.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
