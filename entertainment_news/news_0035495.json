We tried to be as discreet as possible, but of course could not get away from wide shots in which everything is visible,\" says Kee-Leen Irvine, managing director of Rapid Blue and producer of the show. \nFriday night’s naked wedding episode with the wedding that was filmed at a bushveld retreat on the outskirts of Pretoria, took longer in post-production since it required more work: a lot of blurring. \n\"Post production did take longer as our editor spent many, many hours covering up the nether regions. But ... as you know, there are some things you just can't 'un-see', so they might be scarred for life - it's just too early to tell!\" \n\"We did add one or two extras that we think will be enjoyed by viewers, but they'll have to wait and see what they are!\" \nThe Four Weddings SA episode at 20:50 tonight entitled \"Naked Ambition\" also features the Zulu maiden Nthabiseng marrying her longtime Swati boyfriend in Johannesburg's botanical gardens, the wedding of Sizakele who is going over the top with an extravagant wedding at a picnic spot and bride Storm's elegant, rustic country wedding. \n( Photos: Rapid Blue )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T10:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:26:10.577+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
