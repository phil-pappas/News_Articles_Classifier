Upping the ante over the lynching of 52-year-old Iqlakh over rumours of beef consumption in Dadri in UP’s Greater Noida, the Samajwadi Party(SP) supremo said stern action will be taken in the matter “even if we have to sacrifice the government.” ”The Dadri incident was a pre-planned conspiracy…You will come to know the names. According to the information I have gathered, three persons related to a particular party are behind the incident,” Yadav, a former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, alleged at a news conference here. (Also Read: Plea for certificate to riots documentary: HC seeks CBFC reply) Yadav claimed that the three persons were also behind the 2013 communal riots in Muzaffarnagar in which 62 people were killed. ”I talked to my party members and they said these three persons were also behind the riots in Muzaffarnagar. They succeeded in killing people, but failed to break communal harmony,” he added. Yadav said a party delegation will be sent to Dadri after which it will become clear who these three persons were.“We will take stern action once the names are clear, whatever sacrifices the government has to make…Even if we have to sacrifice our government, we will crush the communal forces,” he added. He said it was a conspiracy “to oppress the people of a specific community. The SP will not allow this conspiracy to succeed”. He also claimed that communal forces were hatching conspiracies against the SP government which, he said, was gaining popularity because of its development works.“I want to urge Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has given the slogan of ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas’ and is also an MP from Uttar Pradesh to think over it seriously,” he said. The (Dadri) conspiracy was hatched to break the confidence of the people in SP, he said, adding, “It was a serious incident. It happened at a time when his son was protecting the country’s border. It has to be taken seriously.” \n 39 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:17:23.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
