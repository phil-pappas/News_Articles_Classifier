It’s a marathon. One in which candidates say and do the darndest and dumbest things.\nI was reminded of that Monday at two political forums, one — a daylong event at the Savannah Morning News building — and the other, an evening affair at Tybee Island.\nI left both venues a little sadder and wiser, but with a greater respect for political candidates with the stamina and the guts to subject themselves to a brutal schedule and a drumbeat of questioning from voters and would-be know-it-alls like me.\nI say sadder for two reasons: After listening to responses from candidates for Savannah City Council, I’m not sure if some of them know how the city’s council-manager form of government works. In a nutshell, the city manager is the most powerful figure at City Hall. It’s not the mayor, although the mayor is extremely important in steering the ship of state. Another reason for tears was the lame answer given by 1st District Alderman Van Johnson to a question posed by Emily Jones from Georgia Public Broadcasting, who did double duty with me on two of the morning aldermanic forums. When asked about addressing the high poverty rate in the 1st District, Johnson breezily and callously responded that statistically, things will dramatically improve with the stroke of a pen after Jan. 1. That’s when, Johnson said, Yamacraw Village, Frazier Homes and Kayton Homes— three public housing projects — will be redistricted out of the 1st District.\nHow that will improve the lives of the mostly impoverished women and children who live there wasn’t explained, unless it means they will be represented in the future by an alderman who has better ideas about poverty reduction.\nNot surprisingly, crime reduction was a popular topic of discussion, including the need to fill the 59 vacancies at the Metro police department and giving Chief Joseph Lumpkin the tools he needs to do a better job. Savannah Morning News reporter Eric Curl asked the candidates running for the District 4 seat where they would find the money to beef up police. “We’re not talking about that much money,” candidate Julian Miller, a former Metro police spokesman said, adding that the money for police salaries is “already in the budget.” Resolving the issue of poor police pay is critical, as it’s contributing to an exit of experienced officers from the force and creating headaches for Lumpkin, who is paying sergeants more than lieutenants and is hurting his ability to make personnel moves. Mary Ellen Sprague employed a bit of smoke and mirrors, adding that Lumpkin failed to spend about $1.9 million in the city’s police budget last year, making it appear that City Council is doing all it can support Metro financially, and that the main problem is how those funds are being spent.\nLumpkin, who said Tuesday that he had no desire to mix it up with Savannah political candidates, has proved himself to be a quick learner since his arrival in the chief’s office last Nov. 11. However, most of that $1.9 million represents the accrual of unspent salaries for all the officers (605 positions) in the city’s 2015 budget. And not filling officer positions, especially when crime is up, is no way to save money. Instead, the chief said, he’s mostly frustrated with the slow pace of making changes. ”I’ve always heard about the Great State of Chatham,” he said. “Now I know what that means. We take our time down here.”\nI attempted to quicken the pace during a forum for 5th District candidates, Shaundra McKeithen and incumbent Alderwoman Estella Shabazz. Shabazz, in her opening remarks, rightly stressed the importance of “leading by example.” I asked her if she might do exactly that by apologizing to McKeithen, who was sitting next to her, for the alleged actions of County Commissioner Yusuf Shabazz, Estella Shabazz’s husband.\nMcKeithen claimed the commissioner flashed a handgun at her and threatened her during a political forum Oct. 1 at the Mark Ralph Gilbert Civil Rights Museum. She even filed a police report of a terroristic threat, which officers are investigating.\nJudging from the hoots and howls from the pro-Shabazz faction in the audience, you would have thought that I asked if the Shabazzes served boiled kittens and puppies at their corner take-out restaurant. Ultimately, the question was withdrawn, robbing Shabazz of a golden opportunity to take the high road in a campaign that seems to be getting mighty low.\nFor his part, Shabazz denied in a report on WTOC-TV last week that he brought a firearm to the forum or that he threatened his wife’s political foe, calling that “100 percent false.”\n“Under no circumstances would I ever consider bringing a firearm, a gun into any public building.” Shabazz said. “I don’t own a gun; I don’t have a license for a gun.”\nShabazz said he called the county attorney to find out what he should do to contest the allegations made by McKeithen. The County Attorney, Jon Hart, advised him to keep his yap shut, he said, which is always good advice in Shabazz’s case.\nMcKeithen told me Monday the police investigation into her case has been stymied by the refusal of Chester Dunham, a local political activist, to give police a copy of a video he made of the forum.\nI consider myself wiser Monday because I witnessed the power of people, and the stupidity of some politicians, first hand on Tybee Island, during a forum organized by the Forever Tybee political organization. I served as moderator for the event at Tybee’s splendid new public safety building. Six candidates are running for three of the six City Council seats up for grabs. Only two candidates, Paul Wolff and Julie Livingston, showed up. The others, challengers John Bremer Sr. and Stephen Friedman and incumbent Mayor Pro Tem Wanda Doyle and incumbent council member Barry Brown, were no-shows. Just to remind people, the names of the absentees were left in front of empty seats where they were supposed to sit, always a nice touch.\nBut why blow everyone off? Gee, was it something I said? I even showered that morning and wore socks, which are considered formal wear at the beach. While that may have been a big mistake on my part, I’m used to making them. But for Bremer, Friedman, Brown and Doyle, blowing off this plugged-in and eager crowd of about 250 people was an even bigger boo-boo, especially after organizer Shirley Wright explained, they had all RSVP-ed.\nOne agitated Tybee-ite suggested the candidates who didn’t show up were cowards, which seemed like a fair assessment especially after moderating the question and answer phase, which didn’t involve much heavy lifting on my part or the parts of Wolff and Livingston — on issues like building a swimming pool, and improving the Tybee Road — not exactly brain-busters or trick questions. I hope that Bremer, Friedman, Brown and Doyle had good reasons for skipping this event, like heart surgery or a kidney transplant, because, they just cost themselves a few hundred votes in the winner take all races. “We showed up and we want our questions answered,” an audience member told me. “We want to know their answers.”\nSo I did the next best thing: I read the questions that attendees had submitted for the individuals who didn’t show up. The audience supplied their own answers — any version of the words that amount to “stuff it.” And I’m not talking ballot boxes.\nTom Barton is the editorial page editor of the Savannah Morning News. tom.barton@savannahnow.com", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-13T19:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:13:37.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
