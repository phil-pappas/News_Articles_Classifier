(Read: Shiv Sena promises to disrupt ex-Pakistan minister KM Kasuri’s book launch in Mumbai; Devendra Fadnavis assures ‘security’) \nThe attack comes in the wake of Kulkarni’s refusal to back down from organising Kasuri’s book launch. ”I profusely thank MaharashtraCM @Dev_Fadnavis for his principled & firm stand against #ShivSena threat to disurpt #Kasuri booklaunch. #Mumbai supports India-#Pakistan dialogue for peace,” Kulkarni had tweeted earlier. \nThe Shiv Sena has been vehemently protesting against Kasuri’s book launch, saying it was an insult to the Indian soldiers who had died in the recent ceasefire violations by Pakistan, and had warned that there would be repercussions if the event was not cancelled. \n  11:30 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:37:52.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
