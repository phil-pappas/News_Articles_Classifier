Frank Stefanko Christmas morning will come a little early for Bruce Springsteen fans this year.\nIt'll actually fall on Dec. 4 this year because that's the day we get to open our latest present from Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band . That's the day \"The Ties That Bind: The River Collection\" will be released, according to an announcement posted to Springsteen's website (springsteen.net) overnight last night.\nAnd it may actually take a day or two to enjoy the whole gift because it's chockfull of goodies. There'll be 52 tracks on four CDs; the original double album plus 1979's The River: Single Album, which was never released; 22 count 'em studio outtakes from that period, which didn't make the original album; there's concert film from the Nov. 5, 1980 show in Tempe, Ariz.; rehearsal footage before the recording sessions (so thankful for those people who thought to have a movie camera with them way back when); and, ta-da, a new documentary about the record by none other than Thom Zimny.\nWhat more could a Springsteen fan want? Well, Bruce & Company thinks we might like a beautiful 148-page book with photos and memorabilia from the period when the album was being created and the following tour.\nSo Springsteen fans can look forward to some new songs to discover as well as some old trusty tunes to reminisce with. They're sure to spend the holidays remembering where they were in life and what they were doing when they first heard the ballad \"The River.\" They'll be thinking about the car they were driving when they first sang \"Sherry Darling\" at the top of their lungs while driving. They'll be recalling what in their own life made \"Stolen Car\" just haunt them, maybe haunting them still.\nRead an in-depth look at the package at backstreets.com here\nRead Rolling Stone's take on the box set here\nRead Pitchfork's story and analysis here\nSo get out that old vinyl and give it a spin, and let the anticipation begin.", "external_links": ["http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bruce-springsteen-details-massive-the-river-box-set-20151015", "http://pitchfork.com/news/61655-bruce-springsteen-announces-the-river-box-set/", "http://www.backstreets.com/news.html"], "published": "2015-10-16T17:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:05:08.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
