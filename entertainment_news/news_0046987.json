The same risk is inherent in overhauls of classical ballet. \nLouisville Ballet took that risk in Friday’s season opening performance reworking the classic story ballet “Coppélia” to give audiences a payoff that included a modernized and more deeply heartfelt love story and a fantastically eerie second scene in the workshop of the conniving inventor Dr. Coppélius. \nThis adaptation was the idea of company artistic and executive director Robert Curran, who studied Louisville’s history and saw the ballet’s story \nHe also worked with a team including Dan Fedie on costumes and artist Jacob Heustis on the sets to create a new world for the ballet. \nThe neighborhood on stage is not literally revealed, but it is represented in abstract through a collage made up of newspaper clippings from the era and paint that provide the outlines of houses and a church. WWI-era Germantown set of ballet's 'Coppelia' \nAgainst this backdrop, the story unfolds with the introduction a group of young couples including Swanhilde (Erica De La O) and her fiancé Franz (Kristopher Wojtera). Both they and their friends find fascination with an unfamiliar young woman to the neighborhood reading near a window inside one of the nearby buildings. \nSwanhilde dances for her to get her attention and introduce herself, but the young woman hardly moves or even bats an eye. Later, when Franz tries to do the same, Swanhilde eyes him and believes he is flirting. That sets off a rift between that two that underscores much of the story. \nFrom that window, the audience sees this young woman dressed in blue (Olivia Hagen) under the eye of her caretaker Dr. Coppélius (Harald Uwe Kern) in what seems like enhanced video projections. At times those projections magnifies their images in the window to provide a highly surreal effect. It’s a witty clue that something is highly amiss here. \nThe worlds of Dr. Coppélius and Swanhilde and Franz collide after she finds the doctor’s key in the street and decides to investigate with friends. \nThat leads to a highlight of this production: a magical world of large dolls in a room painted in a style highly reflective of Fauvist paintings of Henri Matisse. Here, the walls can glow and there are strange, large dolls resembling a general, Atilla the Hun, Queen Victoria, a gypsy, Napoleon, an oversized German Bisque doll and an unfinished doll, whose heads were created by Allison Anderson. \nThe choreography, which Curran said he based on that created in 1954 by Royal Ballet choreographer Dame Ninette De Valois, remains much in line with classical ballet. But Curran and the dancers infuse it with high comedy— especially De La O and the other ballerinas who enter and explore the workshop and set the dolls off in motion \nIn the final act, the couple does marry, but blissful matrimony is overshadowed by war, which Curran shows through a solo of a nurse danced by Natalia Ashikhmina. The segment helped set a new tone for this ballet by showing that hardships, including war, can always be on the horizon. But it also suggested that those hardships can be tapered by love and community. Ballet's $1M anonymous gift signal to community \nThe company continued to show its highly skilled dancing, particularly De La O and Wojtera. \nDe La O, in particular, demonstrated her musicality during a solo in the third act in which she lightly jumps on one toe en pointe to the rhythm provided by the Louisville Orchestra under the direction of conductor Charles Barker. (Barker also hold the position as principal conductor of American Ballet Theatre.) \nThe ballet company also stood out during its performances of the ballet’s mazurka and czardas, but the stage of the Brown Theatre often proved so small that the choreography and the dancers looked too cramped. \nThe fact that the color scheme, found in both the costumes and set, was so based in beiges and browns muddled the action even further. \nAlas, since “Coppélia” premiered in 1870, Léo Delibes’ score has continued to offer a large dose of charm to this ballet. The Louisville Orchestra under Barker gave an inspiring performance that was evident in how the musicians and dancers were in lockstep. \nPerformances of “Coppélia” are at 2 and 8 p.m. Saturday at Brown Theatre, 315 W. Broadway. Tickets are $35 to $110.
