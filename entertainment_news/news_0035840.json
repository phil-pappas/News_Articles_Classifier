The remains are believed to be from members of the U.S. military.\nThe crash site was discovered in 1993 and the remains of five airmen previously were handed over to the U.S. in 1999, the paper said. The additional bones were found during an expedition to the remote site in August to recover parts of the aircraft for a museum.\nPlay Video Newsmakers A forgotten corner of hell Anderson Cooper accompanies volunteers searching for the remains of World War II airmen missing in action in the waters off Palau.\nBetween 1942 and 1945, U.S. planes flying between Sookerating in the eastern Indian state of Assam and the Chinese wartime capital of Kunming delivered approximately 650,000 tons of supplies to China-based U.S. forces and to Chinese Nationalist forces battling the Japanese.\nHigh altitude, bad weather and aircraft failure made the journey hazardous, resulting in the loss of 594 aircraft along with 1,659 personnel. Many planes simply became lost, ran out of fuel and crashed into the rugged mountains.\nDespite the history of joint struggle, the Communist's 1949 victory in the Chinese civil war forced the Nationalists to flee to Taiwan and set the stage for decades of mutual suspicion between Beijing and Washington. That precluded any chance of cooperative searches for remains until the normalization of diplomatic ties in 1979.\nWhile Beijing now again honors the wartime alliance, it remains locked in a struggle for military supremacy in Asia, particularly in the South China Sea where their forces operate in close proximity.\nEven so, exchanges between the U.S. and Chinese militaries have grown in both scale and depth. Earlier this week, a U.S. Navy delegation visited China's first aircraft carrier and a submarine training base.", "external_links": ["http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/11/24/d41afb3d-041c-4d5b-8030-476afd96778a/thumbnail/220x140/6a76318dc3ce714c6f264dad6dcafdc0/60cooper11232014312321640x360.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T17:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:16:17.425+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
