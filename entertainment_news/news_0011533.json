This show is about betrayal, thematically, in a way. And I think that it's an emotion that is very relatable.\" \n\"The Romeo Section\" stars Andrew Airlie as Prof. Wolfgang McGee, a scholar of international relations specializing in Chinese affairs. \nIn a more recent interview, Airlie described his character as a Scottish immigrant and loner who finds himself at odds with out-of-touch superiors. \n\"In some cases I don't think he feels his intelligence is being properly used,\" said Airlie, who puts his own Scottish heritage to use by adopting an authentic accent. \n\"But even more than that I think because he's at an arms-length relationship from CSIS, he's quite difficult to control.\" \nHe said Wolfgang's occasional unease with others extends to his relationship with asset Rufus, played by Juan Riedinger of the Netflix series \"Narcos.\" \n\"As much as he wants or needs to be (tough) to get the intelligence out of these people that he needs, I think there's part of him that is genuinely conflicted and there is a caring side of him that you'll see in later episodes.\" \n\"The Romeo Section\" is not a Canadian \"Homeland,\" he added. \nAirlie described Haddock's writing as \"a little more idiosyncratic\" and \"elliptical\" than what's seen on the celebrated Showtime series about a volatile CIA officer. \n\"I think he's trying to make a show that's a little bit counter to a lot of what's going on at the moment. He's trying to cut through the noise,\" says Airlie. \n\"I'm not trying to smack down another show but we're not superheroes and we're not spies in the Bond kind of style. It's a quieter show than that, but hopefully every bit as intriguing.\" \nHaddock is the man responsible for some of CBC-TV's most heralded series of the late '90s and 2000s, including \"Da Vinci's Inquest,\" \"Da Vinci's City Hall\" and \"Intelligence.\" \nThe acclaimed showrunner might be the closest thing Canada has to the big-name TV gurus south of the border, where \"Mad Men\"'s Matt Weiner, \"Breaking Bad\"'s Vince Gilligan and \"The Newsroom\"'s Aaron Sorkin crafted auteur-driven fare for the small screen. \nAfter honing his skills on \"Boardwalk Empire,\" Haddock said he's happy to be back at the CBC, an institution still reeling from deep budget cuts and the loss of NHL broadcast rights. \n\"I've had great successes here in the past and am very comfortable with the people and the support that's been expressed,\" he said. \n\"But also because I get to write about Canada in a really intimate way and obviously it's the country that I know best.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T15:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:52:54.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
