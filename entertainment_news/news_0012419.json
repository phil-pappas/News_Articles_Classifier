(Video via Island Def Jam Music Group / Justin Bieber ) \nAccording to TMZ , the cover art on his new album is \"provocative\" enough for several Middle-Eastern countries and Indonesia to reportedly ban sales of the album. \nThe artwork for \"Purpose\" was recently released and features a shirtless Biebs showing his prominent cross tattoo while posing in what appears to be a prayer position. \nBetween Bieb's sexy bod on the cover and the Christianity reference, TMZ was told the countries, which are predominantly Muslim, are taking issue with the cover art. \nBieber's used to controversy at this point â€” he's been trying to rehabilitate the bad-boy image he developed over the past few years, with the slight hiccup of some naked pictures that surfaced on the Web in October. \nThis album is practically in a dead heat against One Direction's new album, \" Made in the A.M. ,\" which is set to release the same day. Every dollar is going to count, which is why TMZ says Bieber's team is reportedly trying to design an alternate album cover. (Video via Island Def Jam Music Group / Justin Bieber ) \nThe cover, which actually has three different versions, was designed by LA street artist Retna , whose work has appeared in Nike and Louis Vuitton. \n\"Purpose\" has already had some massive hype since the release of the first single, \" What Do You Mean? ,\" which was also Bieb's first No. 1 song on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. He also released this shirtless teaser video showcasing some new choreography and a quick bit of music from a new song. \"Purpose\" releases Nov. 13. \nThis video includes images from Getty Images.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T23:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:22:04.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
