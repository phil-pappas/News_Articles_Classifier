In the course of her journey, she also falls in love.\n\"Any role that plays crime drama, it gives you a really good platform to display your talents. Playing a criminal is a bonus,\" said James, a Sydney native who starred in Davo Hardy's drama, \"The Lives We Lead,\" and has landed roles in four other features this year. \"Jimmy is from Belfast. He's a criminal, a gangster. He distributes cocaine around Miami. He has a network of henchmen and others who work for him.\"\nChilds is a U.K. native who makes her directorial debut and is a writer/artist based in Miami. Speaking of Jimmy Malone, she said, \"He draws you in much more than you'd expect. He's very cunning. He always wants to feel superior. He's a street guy looking to get an edge on people.\"\nNow in pre-production, \"Killer Eyes\" is set to shoot on location in Miami and then have its film festival premiere in 2016.\nIt is a compelling tale of glamor, violence and love set against the backdrop of Miami drug communities inhabited by a motley cast of characters. In the vein of \"Kill Bill,\" \"Colombiana\" and \"Salt,\" the film features stylized violence and a strong leading female.\nChilds noted the September arrest of Melissa Margarita 'La China' Calderon Ojeda, who is accused of heading a violent cartel hit squad, is a timely, real world reflection of some content in \"Killer Eyes.\"\n\"It seems like this is a really good time for this movie to come out,\" Childs said. \"The movie is really resonating with what's going on in real life and what's going on in Hollywood. People are looking at Latin actresses and looking at women being violent. It goes against the norm. I think many people are going to be surprised and shocked.\"\nJames agreed. \"With Lauran's writing, it's not about your typical New York mobsters. It's about an Irish mobster who connects with Latin gangsters. I think it's a good story. It's about this young girl who has a really bad upbringing. She's from the wrong side of the tracks. She goes down the path of crime, but she hopes to find her way out of it through love. It's a good dramatic, transitional movie. It shows the journey of a character.\"\nLima will fill that role in \"Killer Eyes\" where she plays Cleo. She is previously known for her leading roles in \"Disney Club\" and \"Disney CRUJ\" for Disney Channel Brasil. Lima also starred in and won awards for the horror short, \"Sabina\" and the short thriller, \"A Little Panic, A Little Fear.\"\nAlso starring is Dennis Matos (\"Scars of a Predator\"), who has been a police office in New Jersey for more than 20 years and is playing Ricardo in \"Killer Eyes.\"\nJames, who from 1992-2002 was a professional wrestler for the Australian Wrestling Federation, stands paramount to production, playing Lima's opposite.\nOf James' audition and early portrayal of the villainous Malone, Childs said, \"I liked his look. He had a lot of emotions and thoughts going through his face. He did a lot of subtle things that were extremely compelling. He portrayed complexity even though it's a very straight character. He's someone you love to hate.\"\nJames said, \"It's just such a wide range you can bring to the role playing the villain.\"\nRange is something James has shown a great deal of lately in his impressive filmography that's active and expanding. So far in 2015, James has starred in the feature films \"The Rock\" from director Pia Justine Cruz, Maha Wilson's action thriller, \"Damaged\" and the feature thriller \"2:22\" with Michiel Huisman (\"The Age of Adaline\") and Teresa Palmer (\"Warm Bodies\"). James played Sam in the feature drama \"The System\" directed by Eddie Arya (\"The Navigator\") that will premiere in November in Sydney.\nEngaging his outstanding acting talents in short films, James acted in a leading role in David Hansen's romantic comedy, \"Slingshot,\" in Quanith Ilahi's \"Metanoia,\" SFS Productions' \"What Time,\" \"Doktor\" from director Arie Hirsh (\"Gem\") and John K-ay's \"Restoring Hope.\" James has also been cast in K-ay's upcoming feature film - \"Irreversible Choices MA15+\" - based on a true story. While attending the renowned New York Film Academy in Los Angeles, James accumulated an impressive body of work, where he acted in a dozen student-produced films.\nOn television, James has acted in \"Deadly Women,\" a series featuring true stories of female killers that's run for nine seasons and is broadcast by the Discovery Channel, and in \"The Dalfram Dispute,\" produced by Why Documentaries for ABC and SBS TV.\nJames has acted in a voice over role for the Conceptual Mechanics web series, \"Blind Date,\" and he's acted in productions of \"West Side Story,\" \"Leader of the Pack,\" \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Don't Dilly Dally\" for the Campbelltown Theatre Group, the oldest and largest theatrical company in the Macarthur area of southwestern Sydney.\nFor more information, visit: http://www.imdb.me/morrison-james\nFollow Morrison on Twitter and Facebook:\nhttps://twitter.com/morrisonjamesoz\nhttps://www.facebook.com/morrison.james.58511\nTo view Morrison's work or Demo Reels - send link request to:\nH.K.
