Courtesy: Channel Ten / The Project October 16th 2015 an hour ago /video/video.news.com.au/Entertainment/ COMEDIAN Russell Brand has told Australia what he really thinks about Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull — and he left viewers in stitches. The outspoken English star, who is here for a national stand-up comedy tour, appeared on The Project where he was asked for his opinion of Mr Turnbull. After co-host Fifi Box asked him for his views, Brand gave a very blunt reply that sent the panel and the audience into hysterics. “Why do you put really rich people in charge of your country who want to build a thing called a tax shield?” he said. In his brash, comical way, he then went on to question and criticise Mr Turnbull’s decision to move some of his money offshore to the Cayman Islands. Rusty fires up ... Brand appeared on The Project. “Also what’s that — he’s got money in the Cayman Island but there’s nothing wrong with it?Having your money in the Cayman Islands is like putting your d**k into custard. We all want to do but there’s no rational reason to do it. If your d**k’s in a bowl of custard, you’re doing it for a reason.” Other Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T12:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T13:34:07.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
