Bruce Willis is expected to return for Die Hard 6 in a story that would focus on the origins of the younger John McClane character, set in New York City in 1979. The plan is for Willis to appear in the narrative as a present-day version of McClane. \nThe actor has not signed a deal yet. Willis previously worked with di Bonaventura in G.I. Joe: Retaliation. \nThe film has not been officially titled but it’s unlikely to be called Die Hard 6. Fox has dispensed with numbers in the titles in the last three films. \nWiseman directed the fourth installment of the franchise in 2007 with Live Free or Die Hard, which grossed US$383 million (S$526 million) worldwide. The fifth film, 2013’s A Good Day to Die Hard was directed by John Moore and grossed US$304 million worldwide. \nThe original Die Hard opened in 1988 with John McTiernan directing, followed by Die Hard 2 with Renny Harlin in 1990. McTiernan directed Die Hard with a Vengeance in 1995. \nWiseman also directed the first two Underworld movies and 2012’s Total Recall He’s repped by CAA. \nDi Bonaventura is best known for producing the Transformers and G.I. Joe franchises. \nThe news was first reported by Deadline Hollywood.
