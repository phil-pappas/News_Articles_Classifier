He’s brilliant, he’s taken it really seriously.” \n“Whitney’s doing everything she can to help him through it. \n“Depression isn’t something that just comes and goes. It’s an ongoing process so she’s trying to be there for him without getting Mick involved because Lee feels he wants to be a strong son.” \nShona also hinted at what’s to come for her character, who will be spending Christmas with the Carters, revealing that she hopes Whitney will bond more with Lee’s mum Linda. \n“I don’t think linda knows just quite what Whitney’s gone through [with Bianca’s ex, Tony]”, she added. “And I think viewers will hopefully see that. I’d love to work with Kellie Bright more.” \nThe storyline will develop in the run-up to Christmas, and there’s also drama ahead for other Albert Square residents, including Stacey Slater .
