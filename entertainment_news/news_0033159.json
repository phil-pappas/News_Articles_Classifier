Fathomevents.com.\nHOW MUCH: Price varies by theater. \nVampires, as \"Dracula\" taught us, cast no reflection.\nYet the best-known \"Dracula\" of all, the iconic Hollywood film of 1931, had its own mirror image.\nThere were two \"Draculas\" in 1931. One is the famous version, starring Bela Lugosi, that launched Hollywood's horror cycle (\"Frankenstein,\" made in response to the success of \"Dracula,\" came out a few months later).\nBut there was a second \"Dracula.\" It was made at the same time, on the same sets, with the same script, but with different actors, different director and, most significantly, a different language — Spanish. And there are many critics who say it's the better film.\nYou can judge for yourself, when Fathom Events, in association with Turner Classic Movies and Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, puts both films back-to-back for a special Halloween double feature on Sunday and Wednesday at selected local theaters.\n\"I think there is certainly a film buff aspect to it,\" says John Rubey, CEO of Fathom Events. \"Just to experience the original 'Dracula' by itself is something that is going to bring horror film fans out. But this is like seeing fraternal twins, [who] turn out to be completely different people.\"\nMovies, from the start, had an international audience. In the silent days, this was no problem: Subtitles could easily be translated. But the talkies, still new in 1931, presented new problems. Dubbing and captioning had yet to be thought of. The earliest solution was to simply remake the film in another language, which is why in 1930 there were two versions of \"The Blue Angel\" (German and English) and \"Anna Christie\" (German and English) and in 1931 two versions of \"The Threepenny Opera\" (German and French). \nBut \"Dracula\" is a special case. The famous English-language version made Lugosi a star, and Dracula – created by Bram Stoker in his 1897 novel – into a world-renowned character. The film, seen today, still has great moments (particularly in the first 15 minutes).\nBut many, over the years, have lamented that it isn't better. Much of the film – the second half especially – seems slow and stagey. The dialogue is turgid, the camerawork often static. Plot points aren't resolved. The most dramatic things seem to happen offstage.\nIf \"Dracula\" seems a bit tentative, it's hardly surprising. No one back then was sure how the public would react to a bona fide horror film, a thing that hardly existed at the time. There had been so-called \"spook melodramas\" – movies about masked madmen (\"The Phantom of the Opera,\" 1925) or gloomy mansions where the villain tried to scare the heroine out of the inheritance she would win if she stayed the night (\"The Cat and the Canary,\" 1927). \nBut there had never been an American movie with a genuinely supernatural monster – much less one with the revolting habit of biting ladies on the neck and sucking their blood.\nAdd to this uncertainty the erratic behavior of the director, Tod Browning, still boozily mourning the recent death of his friend Lon Chaney (originally slated to play Dracula), and the cheapness of the studio, Universal, which cut costs by forcing the screenwriters to hew closely to the 1927 Broadway version of \"Dracula\" – mostly set in a drawing room – rather than the original novel.\nThe resulting film is a triumph of actors — particularly Lugosi — and subject matter over style. But every evening at 6 p.m., as the American cast and crew wrapped for the day, the Spanish actors would come on the sets and reshoot the scenes. The director of this second version, George Melford (an American), is said to have made a point of watching the rushes of the Lugosi version, seeing how he could improve on them.\nAs a result, the Spanish \"Dracula\" – unseen in America until recent years – is in many ways a more fluid, cinematic film. When Dracula makes his first appearance on the staircase in the American version, the camera just sits, motionless. In the Spanish version, it swoops in for a close-up.\nThe Spanish film is also less prudish than the American. The women's clothes are sexier, more revealing. When Mina (Helen Chandler) talks about the nocturnal visits of Dracula, she says \"I felt so weak – as if all the life had been drained out of me.\" Her Spanish counterpart, Eva (Lupita Tovar), says, \"I felt so weak – as if I had just lost my virginity.\"\nMany viewers would concede that Carlos Villarias, though adequate, is a less impressive Count Dracula than Lugosi. But Pablo Alvarez Rubio, in the plum part of the fly-eating maniac Renfield, is possibly even wilder and crazier than Dwight Frye, who so memorably played him in the American version.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T13:01:11.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
