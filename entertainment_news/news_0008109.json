Drama Critics awards winning play \"The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds\" by Paul Zindel Friday, Saturday and Sunday, Oct. 23, 24 and 25, at 7 p.m. in the vestry of First Baptist Church, 95 High St. \nThe acclaimed play is a powerful and moving study of an embittered and vindictive widow and her two young daughters. The tortured and torturing Beatrice makes life a misery for anyone she touches but despite her acid tongue and cruel demeanor, the girls, like the marigolds, manage to survive and thrive under the most unlikely of circumstances. \nThe cast features Dorothy Wilson as Beatrice, Dana Wilson as Ruth, Maggie Goscinski as Tille, Elaine Landry as Janice and Martha McKenna as Nannie. The show is directed by Aynne Ames. Alyson Peabody is stage manager. \nTickets may be purchased at the door or in advance at Left Bank Books, 109 Church St. All tickets are $12; cash and checks are the acceptable currency at both sites.
