As Jobs’ “work wife” Joanna Hoffman, Kate Winslet is never far from his side as an oft-ignored voice of reason and compassion.\nThe three-act style allows the film to break from typical biopic conventions and allows Fassbender to up the intensity in a mighty role.\nAs Jobs, he’s an uncompromising force of nature, a worthy tribute to a man whose shockwaves continue to rock our world.\nagraham@detroitnews.com \n@grahamorama \n\n‘Steve Jobs’ \nGRADE: A- \nRated R for language\nRunning time: 122 minutes", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:50:12.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
