The ones who say they can’t be angry, they frighten her.\n“I don’t think of anger as a bad thing,” said Miller, director of the M.K. Gandhi Institute for Nonviolence on South Plymouth Avenue. “It’s a fantastic emotion. I don’t want to get rid of it. Anger is a flashing light saying that something’s not right.”\nTo help people understand their own and other people’s anger, the Gandhi Institute is hosting a workshop on how to resolve conflict and manage the intense feeling. The event is free, but donations will be accepted.\n“I don’t think of anger as a bad thing. It’s a fantastic emotion. I don’t want to get rid of it. Anger is a flashing light saying that something’s not right.”\nKit Miller, director of the M.K. Gandhi Institute for Nonviolence Miller said anger can be born from fear, frustration or caring. But people who demonstrate their anger can be isolated because friends or family don’t know how to react.\nMiller called anger a beautiful emotion and said there are good reasons to be angry. “I’m worried that if we say it’s not OK to be angry, we walk around being nice dead people. That’s actually not going to help things. I think when people explode, it’s because that’s what they’ve been doing and that’s what they’ve been socialized to do.”\nShe said the workshop can help people develop the skills to handle conflict in safe ways.\n“I’m interested in having a bigger cadre of people in this community who don’t feel upset around someone else’s upset, but are more willing to be interested and relaxed and curious about upset.”\nThe workshops, scheduled for Oct. 24 and Nov. 21, are open to any age. “A lot of times we’ve got 14-, 15-, 16-year-olds sitting next to people in their 70s,” she said. “That’s part of the benefit of it. We can learn from each other and not be afraid of each other so much.”\nThe Gandhi Institute, which receives funding from the University of Rochester, had shifted its focus from holding public events to working with groups who have requested specific programs.\nBut the violence nationally and locally has the leadership looking again at programs to give people confidence when dealing with conflict.\n“I know a lot of people are hungry for this kind of support if they only knew how to get it,” she said.\nPSINGER@Gannett.com\nIf you go\nWhat: Transforming Conflicts: Nonviolence 101.\nWhen: 9:30 a.m. to 1 p.m Oct. 24 and Nov. 21.\nWhere: M.K.
