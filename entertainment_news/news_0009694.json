The indictment alleges that Simmons made the claim as he sought security clearances and in seeking work as a defense contractor. \nAs recently as April, Simmons was identified on air on Fox radio as a \"Fox News contributor.\" In a 2009 Fox News clip, he calls House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi \"a pathological liar\" in a segment about CIA interrogation techniques. \nA Fox News spokeswoman, Carly Shanahan, said Simmons was never more than a guest on the network and that the reference to him on air as \"Fox News contributor\" was an error. \"He was never a paid commentator,\" she said. \nAt an initial appearance Thursday in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Simmons was ordered held pending a detention hearing Friday. No lawyer has yet entered an appearance on his behalf.
