And if you look around, all of the moms are smiling. They're just getting a chance to really enjoy being with their children,\" she said.\nThe smell of nail polish and hair spray filled the boutique, along with sparkly tutus, fairy wings, tiaras and magic wands. There was dancing to Taylor Swift and Katy Perry songs, hair braiding, sprinklings of glitter and lots of smiles.\nBrandi Northrup, a social worker at Edward, said some of the children at Saturday's gathering were \"very critical for many months.\" Many were born between 26 weeks and 30 weeks. One even stayed in the NICU for 135 days.\nTo see those same children running around, playing without a care in the world was \"very surreal,\" she said.\n\"I've been there when they worry if (their child is) going to come out alive. Some of these kids were at the point where they weren't going to make it,\" she said. \"We're really lucky to be able to have an event where they can be special in a different way.\"\nFor most parents, thinking back to the time their child was in a neonatal intensive care unit is emotional, to the point of bringing tears to their eyes.\n\"It was scary, exhausting; the craziest roller coaster I've ever ridden,\" said Averi's mom, Jasmine. \"One day it's good, the next it's not. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.\"\nTiffany Hnat of Plainfield described her daughter's 32 days in the NICU as traumatic. She said the Ronald McDonald Family Room at Edward was her \"saving grace.\"\n\"I was able to stay in the rooms there so I could be there at night, 2, 3 in the morning wake up and just walk down the hall to see her,\" she said. \"If it wasn't for Ronald McDonald House, I probably would have lost it.\"\nBut Saturday's gathering was full of nothing but joy.\n\"It's wonderful,\" Hnat said. \"It's phenomenal to see how much everyone has grown.\"\nOwner Angel Herzberger said she originally agreed to donate a party for a group of seven former patients, but after hearing more about what the families go through, she decided to increase the party to 14 guests. She already hopes to do it again.\n\"I'm so blessed to have healthy children,\" she said. \"In life, sometimes you forget what's important and then all of a sudden your child gets sick and your whole world can be turned upside down. It really touched my heart when they said these kids were so sick and then to see them all laughing, it's just awesome.\"\n News Small Business Naperville Health & Fitness Members Get More Featured Video", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share", "http://glamandglitzonline.com/", "http://www.rmhc.org/"], "published": "2015-10-18T01:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:11:34.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
