Apple's new eye in speech emoji is dedicated to stop bullying. New emoji are finally here, but while you were paying attention to the middle finger emoji you might've missed another emoji with a stronger message.\nApple partnered with Ad Council, a nonprofit dedicated to public-service campaigns, to release a new emoji that would help stop bullying . The emoji is called the eye in speech emoji and it looks like eye inside a speech bubble.\nAd Council released the new emoji as part of its new campaign titled \"I Am A Witness,\" which is launching for National Bullying Prevention Month. Ad Council hopes the emoji will be used as a symbol that can publicly call out bullies, as well as a gesture of support for victims of bullying.\n\"'I Am A Witness' empowers kids to use the new eye emoji and other creative channels to speak up, call out bad behavior, be a friend and put an end to it,\" Ad Council said in a statement.\nApple is not the only tech giant supporting the campaign. Adobe, Facebook, Google, Johnson & Johnson, Snapchat and Twitter have also partnered with Ad Council to spread awareness against bullying.\nAds for the campaign will run on Facebook News Feeds and Twitter timelines. Snapchat will roll out a specific \"I Am A Witness\" photo filter on Thursday. However, no partner will be charging for advertisement.\nFor those who don't have iOS 9.1 and can't access the eye in speech emoji, Ad Council is offering an alternative \"I Am A Witness\" keyboard that can be used on non-Apple devices.\nON A MOBILE DEVICE?
