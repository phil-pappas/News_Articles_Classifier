(AP) - The Arkansas State Fair opens its gates Friday for a 10-day run featuring concerts, rides and new types of fair food. General Manager Ralph Shoptaw says the fair will offer special promotions and discounts daily, including free admission and parking on weekdays from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. so visitors can eat lunch at the fair. Those lunch options will include new foods like the bacon bomber, apple pie fries and ice cream and Arkansas' biggest fried pickle on a stick. Shoptaw says a free shuttle will be available on weekends to alleviate parking woes caused by construction on Roosevelt Road. Visitors can park in designated state government parking lots west of the state Capitol and a shuttle will take them to the fair. \nRelated Link:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:41:20.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
