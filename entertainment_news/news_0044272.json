In Area 2, incumbent Tom Elliott is being challenged by Edward Garcia. In Area 4, incumbent Virniecia Green-Jordan faces Lynne Guthrie.\nThe district serves kindergarten- through sixth-grade students in the Perris Valley area.\nElliott, 69, who spent 27 years as a teacher and continues to train new teachers through University of Phoenix, is running for his third term.\n“The major strength I bring is experience in the field of education,” he said.\nElliott is board president and said the current board members have worked well as a team to improve the district with projects such as a new elementary school under construction, expansion of its dual immersion program for English-learner students and approval of a charter school specializing in performing arts and music.\nGreen-Jordan, 61, who has been on the board since 1985, except two years, wants to expand programs that prepare kids for science, technology, arts and health careers.\n“To create 21st century leaders, it has to start at preschool,” said Green-Jordan, a special education teacher.\nGarcia and Guthrie, who have not held political office before, are running as a team, calling each other running mates who will bring a fresh perspective.\nGarcia, 35, a security officer for the Val Verde Unified School District, said the Perris school district needs to do a better job of improving employee morale. He said employees are not paid as well as neighboring districts and the leadership needs to improve communication.\n“It just seems to have come to a standstill in terms of engaging the community,” he said.\nGuthrie, 50, a homemaker, said one of her priorities is improving special education, noting that she has a granddaughter with Asperger syndrome. She also wants to see the district be better prepared in the event of a school shooting such as one that occured in Oregon recently.\n“I’m doing this because I’m concerned about the safety and well-being of our youth,” Guthrie said.\nContact the writer: 951-368-9558 or ighori@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwc57c-b88540826z.120151016155734000gaccjetu.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwc57c-b88540826z.120151016155734000g3rcjf08.10.jpg", "http://votegreenjordan.com/", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwc57d-b88540826z.120151016155734000gaccjeti.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwc57d-b88540826z.120151016155734000gfeckj9t.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwc57c-b88540826z.120151016155734000gaccjetu.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwc57d-b88540826z.120151016155734000gaccjeti.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwc57d-b88540826z.120151016155734000gfeckj9t.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwc57c-b88540826z.120151016155734000g3rcjf08.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:09:07.221+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
