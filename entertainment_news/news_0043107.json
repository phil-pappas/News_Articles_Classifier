One of 'em, and quite possibly the most important, is Netflix's Daredevil .\nSince season 2 won't be bestowed upon us until 2016 rolls around, use this time to re-watch the newest teaser footage on repeat over, and over...and over again. The new bits, which reveal even more dark and gritty times in store for Matt Murdock and crew, also features some new additions to the killer cast.\nWho might this be in the silky red ninja garb? Sub-out Jennifer Garner for professionally-trained martial artist Elodie Yung and you've got a new take on the elusive Elektra .\nThe Punisher lurks his way into Hell's Kitchen in the upcoming episodes, and to be honest, just the back of his head is intimidating. We'd let Frank Castle crush our skull any day.\nDaredevil hits Netflix in 2016.\nDaredevil season 2 trailer pic.twitter.com/tyM8yOx4ds\nâ€” Alan Lopez (@lmNotAutistic) October 12, 2015", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punisher", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektra_(comics)", "http://t.co/tyM8yOx4ds", "https://twitter.com/lmNotAutistic/status/653603240651546624", "http://maximnew.prod.acquia-sites.com/sites/default/files/editor/2015/10/Elektra.gif", "http://maximnew.prod.acquia-sites.com/sites/default/files/editor/2015/10/Punisher.gif", "http://maximnew.prod.acquia-sites.com/sites/default/files/editor/2015/10/Funeral.gif"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:18:59.233+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
