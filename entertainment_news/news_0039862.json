Her Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest accounts project an oh-so-curated image that is equal parts fashionista, doting mother, corporate deal-maker and cheerleader for her hashtagged cause, #WomenWhoWork.\nSometimes she achieves harmonic convergence.\nFor example, her back-to-school photo on IvankaTrump.com documenting the contents of daughter Arabella’s preschool backpack. It included the 4-year-old’s “favorite Ivanka Trump sandals.”\nAs for politics, Trump, 33, plays down her influence in her father’s quest for the White House.\nBut Donald Trump volunteers Ivanka’s name when asked whose advice he values. It was Ivanka who introduced her father when he announced his campaign for president. It was Ivanka who huddled with him during the breaks when the Republican debates heated up.\n“She’s got great sensibility,” he says, with obvious admiration.\nIn one debate, he even suggested her for a place on the $10 bill (with Rosa Parks as an alternative.) And, years ago, there was the time when he complimented her figure and joked that if she “weren’t my daughter, perhaps I’d be dating her.”\nIvanka Trump declined to be interviewed and her father’s campaign declined to define what she’s doing for the campaign. But a person familiar with their interactions, who spoke on condition of anonymity because discussion of internal conversations was not authorized, says Ivanka has helped with campaign messaging and helped develop her father’s tax plan.\nWhen he was criticized for making derogatory remarks about women, he pushed back with a testimonial of sorts from Ivanka and his current wife, Melania. Both, he says, have attested to his “great respect for women.”\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://www.ivankatrump.com/"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T12:32:14.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
