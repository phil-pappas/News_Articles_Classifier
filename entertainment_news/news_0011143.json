Warner Bros had hoped the 3D Neverland adventure would thrill audiences with its CGI effects and lead performance by Hugh Jackman.\nHowever, its puny opening puts it alongside 2015's other flops The Fantastic Four and Tomorrowland.\n\"It's a huge misfire,\" said Jeff Bock, box office analyst with Exhibitor Relations, adding: \"We won't see another Peter Pan film for awhile.\"\nPan was originally slated to open in July, but Warner Bros pushed it back into October citing the need for more time to complete the visual effects work.\nPlay video \"Hugh Jackman Talks About New Film\" Video: Hugh Jackman Talks About New Film The film's cast also includes Rooney Mara, Garrett Hedlund and newcomer Levi Miller in the title role. British film-maker Joe Wright, best known for Atonement and Pride And Prejudice, directed the movie.\nWarner Bros has suffered a string of failures in recent months, losing tens of millions on the likes of We Are Your Friends, Guy Ritchie's The Man From U.N.C.L.E. and Jupiter Ascending.\nWhile Matt Damon's The Martian has dominated the box office, Pan wasn't the only film to have a disappointing time.\nSony's The Walk stumbled in its wide release.\nThe biopic about Philippe Petit's daring high-wire walk between the Twin Towers cost $35m to produce and has clear Oscar ambitions for director Robert Zemeckis and the technical team behind the film.\nIt has made a paltry $6.4m in its initial two weeks. The Sony team seemed discouraged that positive reviews for the picture's innovative use of 3D and strong word-of-mouth hasn't lifted The Walk higher.\n\"It's a conundrum why more folks didn't come out, because once you see it, it's one of those films that you never forget,\" said Rory Bruer, Sony's distribution chief.\n\"It's a picture that everybody put their heart and soul into.\"\nThe Martian took $37m in its second weekend, pushing its domestic total to $108.7m.\nHotel Transylvania 2 also showed impressive endurance, racking up $20.3m in its third weekend and bringing its stateside haul to $116.8m.\nWith Pan finishing in third place, the top five was completed by The Intern and Sicario.\n:: Pan is released in the UK on 16 October.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T13:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T14:54:28.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
