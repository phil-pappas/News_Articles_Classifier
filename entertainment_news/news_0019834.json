News on Thursday that the 52-year-old star of the sitcom \"Grandfathered\" faces a misdemeanor count of driving under the influence of drugs. On June 12, Stamos was pulled over for reckless driving in Beverly Hills and later arrested at the hospital for DUI. \nThe maximum sentence, if convicted, is six months in county jail. \nTMZ recently reported that Stamos was taking GHB, also known as the date-rape drug, to \"lean out mass\" in preparation for his role on \"Grandfathered.\" \nA month after his arrest, Stamos checked into a monthlong treatment program for substance abuse at an undisclosed rehab facility. \nHe tweeted after his release: \"I'm back! Took a month to take care of things. Healthy. Feeling grateful for the love & support of family & friends.\" \nIn an interview later with Details magazine, Stamos admitted that he had a rough year after his mother died in September 2014. He called the arrest a \"turning point.\" \n\"You either continue on that path -- and some of it's fun, but a lot of it's not -- or there's this other thing, this golden opportunity sitting there with all this work and all this goodwill that you have going for you,\" he told the magazine. \"That's the key. I feel better than I've felt in a decade.\" Ann Tatko-Peterson provides celebrity commentary for the Bay Area News Group. Follow her at twitter.com/atatkopeterson .
