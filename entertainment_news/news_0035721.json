Photo: Simon Ridgway \nFREE TO AIR Scorpion Ten, 6.30pm  \nThings have always been a bit MacGyver with this series – a nuclear bomb is heading towards that childcare centre! Build a deflector ray out of a fruit tin, some toilet paper and chewing gum! – but at least there’s usually some vague sort of sense to things and it was taken reasonably seriously. The Scorpion team members are uber geniuses after all, they know how to do that sort of stuff. This week, however, all sense goes out the window and what we’re left with is a series of slapstick visuals, statements and scenarios that are clearly set up just for laughs. Try this for example: When the president of Latvia is poisoned at a secret meeting, the Scorpion team has to use a stolen taco truck, a ferret, an old cowboy escape tunnel, a salad spinner and a lullaby sung by “Mitzi Von Schneiden, a Lithuanian-Latvian-Belarusian singer” to save the day. All of which is a bit eye-rolling but acceptable. But then you learn the ferret’s name is Bueller. Yes, Ferret Bueller. And a show jumps the shark. \nThe Block Nine, 7pm  \nAdvertisement There’s been a nice bounce back to form with this, the last (for a while at least) series of The Block . After wandering into dangerously dull territory where construction and technique took a back seat to “add more cushions’’, we’re back to what makes the show great: eye-popping design innovation and tantrums. Caro and Kingi’s iPad splashback (yes, iPad splashback) being a good example of the former and Keith’s issues over a structurally dodgy fireplace of the latter. I’ll be sad when the Blocktagon is finished. \nDoctor Who ABC, 7.40pm  \nBy now even the most hardened Matt Smith fan has had to admit Peter Capaldi has not only made The Doctor his own, but has brought in some traits that make a lot of sense. He’s a tougher character now, less flippant and a bit world(s) weary, what you might actually expect of someone who has done a lot of questionable things in his long life and had to live with the consequences. This week that theme pops up again when The Doctor finds himself in England of 1651 fighting a highwayman and his fire-breathing sidekick and paying the price once more for something he did a long time ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T12:11:28.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
