Image 19 of 19 Buttercup’s 7 a.m. gay bar show rocked S.A. 1 / 19 Back to Gallery Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah, Zip-A-Dee-A. My oh my, what a Buttercup day.\nButtercup — the San Antonio art-pop band of Erik Sanden , Joe Reyes , Odie, Emilio Navaira IV and his brother, Diego Navaira known for its offbeat shows — pulled off its kookiest gig yet Friday morning at the Cobalt Club , the gay bar that opens daily at 7 a.m.\nThe virtually windowless dive at the corner of East Ashby Place and McCullough Avenue is a black hole, a mysterious seedy joint whose reputation as a gay hookup is more apocryphal than reality. No light enters, none escapes. But its gravitational pull was especially strong Friday morning because of blaring rock ’n’ roll.\nA standing room crowd of about 75 — graveyard shift regulars, first-timers and rabid Buttercup fans — turned up for doughnuts, bloody marys, beer and tequila shots, exceeding the capacity limits of the tiny place.\nThe Cobalt is often pretty sedate — day or night. But don’t tell that to Kati McAllister , a first-timer who Friday danced atop bar stools the whole time. By the time it was over, she was dripping with sweat.\nGraphic artist Michael Karshis celebrated his 54th birthday at the show. “I’m totally hijacking this for my party,” he said.\nBut that would be to sell short the appeal of Buttercup, and especially its frontman Erik Sanden. There was no hijacking the spotlight from the quirky band, which sounded especially rocked up thanks to the Navaira Brothers . For his part, Sanden downed tequila shots and danced and crawled on the bar.\nGuitarist Frank Karpienski of Los #3 Dinners was among the earlybirds. “I’ve never been in here,” he said. “But I figured, no excuses.”\nButtercup’s bassist, Odie, admitted he hadn’t been to bed. The Navairas had been up all night, too.\n“I’m groggy and delirious,” said Odie, who showed up in a kimono and flip-flops. “It’s like the frickin’ ‘Twilight Zone,’” said Diego Navaira about the scene.\nRicky Bozarth , a Cobalt Club regular, explained that “it’s a more relaxed vibe in the morning.” It’s not such an ungodly hour for those that work overnight.\n“It’s a neighborhood bar,” said Darryl Mitchell , a regular. “It’s our version of Cheers.” On Friday, it felt more like the Mix or the Limelight clubs on the St. Mary’s Strip at closing time.\n“Close that door. I want it to be one-thirty in the morning,” said Sanden as dawn’s early light sometimes filtered in. “We are the warriors of rock.”\nSome fans even sat under the bar at the foot of the band during the one-hour show. Angie Martindale swayed to the beat in a corner. “This is the best way to start the day ever,” said Martindale.\n“Who’s going to work?” Sanden asked moments before singing the Kinks’ “Alcohol.” Moments later the singer was doing push-ups on the bar and singing the original “ Henry B. Gonzalez .” Obviously, the effects of demon alcohol.\nhsaldana@express-news.net", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/56/8727477/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/25/15/32/5559960/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/35/55/02/7786636/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/34/37/50/7469598/8/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/56/8727480/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/35/55/02/7786636/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/34/13/67/7388619/13/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/31/14/30/6604307/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/34/35/52/7461533/10/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/34/13/67/7388636/22/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/26/54/33/5949165/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/34/37/50/7469598/8/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/32/51/11/6984273/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/56/8727479/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/35/55/01/7786616/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/25/15/32/5559960/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/22/72/12/4956836/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/22/72/12/4956836/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/56/8727478/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/34/21/70/7413278/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/34/13/67/7388619/13/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/31/14/30/6604307/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/34/37/35/7468866/15/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/56/8727477/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/26/54/33/5949165/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/34/21/70/7413278/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/35/55/01/7786616/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/34/37/35/7468866/15/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/34/35/52/7461533/10/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/34/13/67/7388641/20/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/34/13/67/7388636/22/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/34/13/67/7388641/20/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/32/51/11/6984273/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/56/8727479/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/56/8727478/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/56/8727480/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T19:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:06:30.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
