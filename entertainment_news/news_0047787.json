And we love them for that.\nOn this week's episode of USA TODAY's Dad Rock podcast, hosts Patrick Foster and Jim Lenahan look back fondly on the one-hit wonders of the '70s. (Other decades will be featured in upcoming episodes.)\n\"I'm a classicist when it comes to one-hit wonders,\" Foster says. \"I'm kind of pure about it. I want to make sure that the artist had no other hits at all. ... And also, I want to make sure that the song has a connection beyond just being a hit at that time, and what I mean by that is I think that a lot of these one-hit wonders appear in other places â€” they might be used in movies; they might be used as pop references.\"\nSo put on those big stereo headphones, pour a glass of cold duck, get comfortable on the shag carpet and press play.\nAll episodes of Dad Rock are available on:\niTunes\n(Subscribe on iTunes to get new episodes automatically every week.)\nSoundCloud\nStitcher\nTuneIn\nStream or download the '70s one-hit wonder episode here:\nMusic featured in this episode:\nLearn more about Dad Rock at dadrock.usatoday.com.\nFollow Dad Rock on Twitter @DadRockShow\nEmail Patrick and Jim at dadrock@usatoday.com\nLeave a message on the Dad Rock Hotline: 571-424-1984\n3 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE //usat.ly/1RkSJEc TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/dad-rock/id983293722?mt=2", "http://tunein.com/radio/USA-TODAY-Dad-Rock-p721528/", "https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/dad-rock/id983293722?mt=2", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f39486453ecc5170ac1368ab3b5e964bdb9f8ed7/c=211-0-1881-2227&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/635793969590925492-dadrock02.jpg", "http://linkmaker.itunes.apple.com/images/badges/en-us/badge_itunes-lrg.svg", "http://usat.ly/1RkSJEc", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RkSJEc&mini=true", "https://twitter.com/DadRockShow", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RkSJEc&text=Dad%20Rock%20grooves%20to%20one-hit%20wonders%20of%20%2770s&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/93af1168b767ce6548fef4153249b529d2480929/r=375x400/local/-/media/2015/10/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/635793969590925492-dadrock02.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/635793969590925492-dadrock02.jpg", "https://soundcloud.com/dadrockshow", "http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/usa-today/dad-rock"], "published": "2015-10-02T23:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:06:00.113+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
