The success of \"Kingsman\" set the standard for the onslaught of spy thrillers / comedies that have been shown this year. With so much money made by the film, fans are wondering what has taken Fox so long to announce the sequel? Like Us on Facebook \nThis is mainly because the international release of the film, as well as the DVD and Blu Ray release of the film, have slowed down the process. \nSuper Hero Hype reports that Matthey Vaughn has been asked to return as director for the sequel, which is a first as none of the director's movies have been given a sequel yet. \nCurrently, there is not a lot of information regarding the sequel as Fox obviously just released the news, but many believe that Taron Egerton will be returning as a full-fledged secret agent. The sequel should be exciting considering how many important people died inside the Kingsman group, and it would be interesting how the storytellers show how that was dealt with. \nEarly rumors have Colin Firth returning as Harry Hart somehow, although it was painfully clear that his character died in the first movie. It would be a nice twist to see how Egerton's character Eggsy would deal with the sudden return of his mentor. Just imagine if Harry would return as a villain in this role---the sparks would certainly fly. \nOther than that, rumor has it that Fox has set a tentative release date for the film, which is June 16, 2017. The date is probably due to a work around on Vaughn's busy schedule, as the director is also set to direct the new \"Flash Gordon\" reboot. \nThe announcement of the release date for \"Kingsman 2\" sees Fox attempting to battle against Disney / Pixar, as Disney has previously announced that \"Cars 3\" will also be debuting on that date. \"Cars\" has always been viewed as Disney / Pixar's weaker franchises, so perhaps the higher ups at Fox can think they can compete with a Disney Summer release. \nAre you excited for the sequel to \"Kingsman?\" Are there any characters that you would like to see return to the film? Any ideas for a new villain? Let us know in the comments below.
