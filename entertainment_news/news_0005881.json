Updated: Wednesday, October 21, 2015, 16:47 [IST] \nHollywood has always been, say the first industry to witness the variety of sexuality. When there are Gays, Lesbians, Transgenders and now a new addition to the family, Pansexuals, whose sexuality isn't restricted to one particular gender. \nHollywood has also witnessed the growing number of celebrity couples, where the women are taller than their men.

No matter how open minded humans have gotten over the years, it is not quite accepted or appreciated in the society if the man is shorter than the woman, in a relationship.But we have gradually evolved to push the idea aside and choose our partner based on other parameters.
