Asmodeus becomes available on the worldwide web this Monday October 19, 2015 in the film's official video-on-demand release. 40-year film industry veteran Eric Jones came out of retirement to produce and direct Asmodeus, an original screenplay he co-wrote with his partner Linda Jones. Asmodeus is a gritty and kitschy horror story underscored by the surprisingly strong performances and poignant between-the-lines messaging about recidivism, the penal and foster care systems, and many other issues that plague urban women.\nThe classic \"spooky house\" art design and the cleverly drab color palette work together to create a potently dreadful and errie feel that live in the world of Hitchcock-ian favorites.\n\"I wanted to make a stylized horror film with a cast of relative unknowns, using the familiar elements but also more than just blood and gore.\" - Eric Jones, Writer/Director\nCo-writer/producer Linda Jones drew upon a decade of social work to inform the writing as they developed the surprisingly complex characters and meaningful story. Mrs. Jones also stars in the film as Sister Mary, alongside a strong cast that includes Joanna Koss (Donut Planet, Dabsity) and comedian Gayla Johnson (Don't Trust the B- in Apt 23, Fierce Funny Women).\n\"Asmodeus\" was shot in Los Angeles through The Banco Film Group, LLC.\nThe film is now available for download via Asmodeusmovie.com and Amazon.com.\n\"Asmodeus\" Credits\nProduction company:\nThe Banco Film Group LLC\nDirector: Eric Jones\nExecutive Producers: Jasmine Serrano, Kaisha Dap\nCinematographer: Leah Anova\nEditor: Stephen Tackett\nVFXEditor: Josh Tackett\nPress Liaison: Mikael Boyd di Sandro\nmikaelhussein(at)me(dot)com\nPhone: 323-377-9035", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:00:45.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
