Chris Evans talks about his midlife crisis: 'I’ve been married three times – does that make me really bad at marriage, or an expert?' \n  \nChris Evans admitted he’d turned to a sex therapist, marriage counsellor, Alcoholics Anonymous and even the Archbishop of York to help stave off a midlife crisis. \nWhile researching the issue for his upcoming book Call The Midlife, the thrice-wed Top Gear host sought help from “an 80-odd-year-old marriage guru” when rumours of problems in his marriage emerged in newspapers. Chris Evans and third wife Natasha Shishmanian (Dominic Lipinski/PA) \n“My issue with marriage is that I’ve been married three times – so does that make me really bad at marriage, or an expert?” he told the Daily Mirror. \n“I really want to stay married, and it was a case of ‘How can I best do that?’ It was about protection of a relationship. My marriage gives me everything – my stability and all that other stuff.” \nChris’ marriage to Natasha Shishmanian was plagued with reports that the pair were experiencing difficulties around the time he was announced as the new host of Top Gear. \nHe rubbished the reports as nonsense and confirmed: “Yes, I am really happy.” Oh no – who's the really unhappy looking woman in the middle ? If you know her please text my show on Monday pic.twitter.com/LCS7izZqib Promoted stories \n— Chris Evans (@achrisevans) June 20, 2015 \nChris poked fun at split rumours on Twitter but explained he had picked up useful advice. \n“It’s not about time – you can be with someone and not be with them. You’re in the park but your head’s in the office. You have to be more present. \n“Often you want your partner to give you more, but actually you need to give them more, and then you will get more. \n“And it does work because I tried it. I literally went home and tried it that night.” Chris Evans and second wife Billie Piper (Myung Jung Kim/PA) \nChris married Natasha, 35, in 2007 and has two children with her, Eli and Noah, as well as 29-year-old daughter Jade from a different relationship. He was previously wed to Dr Who star Billie Piper, 16 years his junior, for six years and Loose Women presenter Carol McGiffin from 1991-1998. \nChris, who turns 50 next April, gave himself 100 days to plan out the rest of his life for the book. Among the experts Chris sought out was the Archbishop of York, John Sentamu to try to figure out “the whole God question”. \n“I definitely believe in something because where does it all come from? But I don’t know what that was and wanted to go and try and find out. \n“Just as there is no scientific formula for love… how do I know I love my son? I just know. And faith is the same thing,” he said. Chris Evans in his old TFI Friday presenting days (Channel 4) \nChris was famous for boozing during his TFI days and when presenting the Radio 1 breakfast show, one incident of which saw him fined a day’s wages for turning up after a 17-hour bender. As part of his research, he went to see an Alcoholics Anonymous adviser. \n“Back in the day, I thought I had a problem… I may well have had. \n“I realised I hadn’t stopped drinking, at all, for more than six days in the last 25 years,” he said. \nHe completed 100 alcohol-free days last year before taking part in the London Marathon this April. Chris Evans and the Stig (Yui Mok/PA) \nWith the announcement of his new position as Top Gear host, Chris’s career is back in its ascendancy. But he admitted to seeing a sex therapist to deal with the third party in their marriage – his obsession with work. \n“The sex lady told me it’s all about staying connected with your partner, and making time for them. It’s also about men and their menage a trois. Not with another woman, but with work. I took things from her but I didn’t specifically make it about me,” he explained. \nChris is back on our screens on October 16 as cult Channel 4 series TFI Friday makes it return with guests U2, Steve Coogan and Saoirse Ronan. U2 TFi Friday sound check. A few hours ago. This is really happening. Tonight 8pm LIVE on Channel 4. pic.twitter.com/0rI5Xqr5RK \n— Chris Evans (@achrisevans) October 16, 2015 \n“I love working. Call that being a workaholic if you like, but I love everything I do, and know I’m very fortunate to be in this position. \nThis time around, Chris is convinced the show will be different: “I’m a lot more relaxed. I was under a lot more pressure before.” Share article \nTFI Friday begins on October 16 on Channel 4 at 8pm. Call The Midlife by Chris Evans is out on October 22.
