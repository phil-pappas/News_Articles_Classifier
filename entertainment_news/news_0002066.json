Currently National American Miss New York Teen 2015, Torchia is a sophomore at St. John Fisher College, majoring in management and minoring in finance. She will compete at the system's national pageant in Anaheim, California, in November.\nTorchia shares that her most intensive preparation period is happening right now, consisting of honing her interviewing skills and onstage presence, staying healthy and preparing mentally.\n\"Mental preparation is one of the most important parts of preparing for me. I think it is important to stay positive and remind myself of my goals and what I want to achieve,\" she stated.\nWhile pageantry is one of her passions, Torchia also sees great importance in her school work. In addition to being a member of her college's history and investment clubs, she is on the Dean's List and has received three scholarships for academic achievements.\nIn her spare time, she enjoys modeling and is part of the Mary Therese Friel Modeling Agency in Mendon.\n\"Being a part of this prestigious agency has taught me so many things about modeling and how to present myself in a positive and professional manner,\" she said. \"The things that I have learned at the MTF Modeling Agency have not only helped me in the modeling and pageant world, but also in my everyday life.\"\nIn addition to modeling, Torchia volunteers for Foodlink, YMCA, the Salvation Army and is an official Red Cross volunteer. Her latest endeavor is creating a nonprofit organization called The Empowerment Project, where she leads workshops for young ladies, teaching them how to be confident and follow their dreams.\nYou can learn more about the National American Miss pageant at at www.namiss.com", "external_links": ["http://www.namiss.com/", "http://www.mtfmodels.com/"], "published": "2015-10-01T02:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:04:51.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
