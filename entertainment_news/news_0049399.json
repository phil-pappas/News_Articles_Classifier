After giving fans the first taste of the new album through the Young Thug -assisted \" Party Favors \" that was released last month, she dropped online on Thursday, October 1 the LP's official first single \"Player\" featuring Chris Brown . Produced by LULOU and Alex Purple, the EDM-tinged mid-tempo R&B tune opens with Tinashe warning her boyfriend, \"So you better stay up, player/ Yeah, you better keep up, player/ Cause tonight is a game-changer.\" Breezy joins her for the last verse, responding to his collaborator with lines like, \"All right, baby girl, I don't want them other b***hes/ You be talking that s**t, calling me a player.\" \"Player\" is scheduled to hit radio stations and iTunes on Friday, October 2. \"I've always kinda wanted to do a song with [Brown],\" Tinashe said when discussing the track. \"Obviously, he's one of the best entertainers of our generation... It's just exciting to be able to work with him.\" Her \"Joyride\" album, meanwhile, has yet to have an official release date, but it's still expected to arrive later this year. In a recent interview, she revealed that doing her upcoming record was easier than doing its predecessor, last year's \" Aquarius \". \"This time around it was fun because it's not the same pressure as making your first album,\" the 22-year-old rising singer shared. \"I kind of already set the tone, set the stage, so now you can just progress and be a little bit more creative, so that's what I'm doing this album. I'm excited about it.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:35:09.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
