The self-professed “monster” in Florida who admitted to disemboweling his girlfriend after she screamed a different man’s name during sex pleaded not guilty to the horrific murder Monday.\nThat came the same day the attorney for Fidel Lopez, 24, withdrew from the case without explanation, the Sun-Sentinel reported. A judge appointed a public defender to fill in.\nLopez, who reported the murder himself in a hysterical 911 call and later detailed it to police, said nothing in court.\nHe is being held without bond for first-degree murder and two counts of sexual battery.\nLopez told police he turned into “a monster” after his girlfriend, 31-year-old Lizaette Nemeth, shouted her ex-husband’s name during Tequila-fueled sex in September. After destroying doors and walls in their Sunrise apartment, Lopez said he penetrated her with a beer bottle, a flat iron and his fists, inserting one arm up to his elbow before disemboweling her. He said he tried reviving her, washed bloods off his hands and smoked a cigarette before calling cops.\nNeighbors were shocked by the sickening severity of the crime — by not by learning of Lopez snapping.\n“He didn’t know how to behave,” one neighbor, Ismary Suarez, told the Sun-Sentinel.\n“He didn’t make friends with anybody.”", "external_links": ["http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/crime/fl-sunrise-grisly-killing-arraignment-20151019-story.html"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T15:47:40.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
