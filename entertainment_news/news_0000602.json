(Back Forty Beer) \nBack Forty Beer's latest creation took a long time to create, but will be available for a limited time. \nTrade Day Cuban Coffee Stout is the company's first production release stout ever. Taking its name from the traditional Southern marketplace, the stout is also a nod to the new trade relationship between the U.S. and Cuba. \n\"Back Forty is committed to celebrating Alabama cultural traditions that have been bringing people together for generations, and we think that Trade Day Cuban Coffee Stout does just that,\" said Back Forty COO Tripp Collins. \nCompany officials say it took three years in the test-batch phases to perfect the taste, which combines five different grains, roasted barley and ground Cuban coffee added after fermentation. \nTrade Day is now available for a limited time throughout fall and winter in 12-ounce glass bottles and on draft in Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi and Tennessee markets. \nThe label also carries an Alabama Oysters seal, as stouts are sometimes paired with local oysters. Back Forty, to get the recipe right, visited the Auburn University Shellfish Laboratory to get a handle on oyster farming in state waters. You can see a video about the collaboration here . \nBill Walton, an associate professor at Auburn University's School of Fisheries, said \"hard work and dedication\" went into the creation of the product. \n\"Alabama's oyster farmers put a great deal of pride in what they do,\" he said. \"We are excited to partner with Back Forty who puts the same passion into their beer.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T07:36:52.615+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
