Known for pushing himself to the edge for the sake of a character, the 49-year-old star plays a car driver in the film directed by S D Vijay Milton and jointly produced by A R Murugadoss and Fox Star Studios. \"Tamil cinema has witnessed quite a few road films but what makes my film different is its treatment, even the stereotypes, and there are plenty, have been treated with a twist,\" Vikram told Mirror.\nHaving mostly worked with established directors like Shankar, Bala and Mani Ratnam, Vikram says he likes to occasionally give a new director a chance. \"When I saw Vijay's Goli Soda, I was so moved by it that I rang him up to congratulate. As we were talking, I asked if he has a script that would interest me, and he had this one. I instantly got hooked to the story, and I knew deep down I wanted to do this film,\" he said adding that he's occasionally on the hunt for filmmakers with interesting projects. Vikram says he recently called and congratulated director Karthik Subbaraj after he watched his film Jigarthanda. No wonder his next film is also with a young filmmaker Anand Shankar, known for his successful directorial debut Arima Nambi.\nThrowing more light on 10 Endrathukulla, which releases in cinemas on Wednesday, Vikram said working in the film was tougher than two years of toil for I. \"See, I'm so used to working hard and I've never complained about it. But Vijay expected me to be extremely casual. He told me that my performance should be fresh and be in total contrast to all the roles I've done so far. It's extremely tough to be casual because I'm not used to it. Hence, I found working in this film more challenging,\" he said.\nThe stunts in the film have already caught the attention of film lovers. He says they were done under the supervision of experts. \"All the dangerous stunts were done within the realm of logic and sanity. Cinema, in my opinion, is made on the concept of make-believe, so, it's important to keep everything as safe as possible,\" he said, adding that he worked in the film with a lot of positivity. \"Right from the moment I signed the project, there was something very positive about it. Throughout the course of the film's shoot, and even now in the post-production, I can still feel the positive vibes. I hope audiences will feel it, too\".\nSamantha has teamed up with Vikram for the first time and he describes her as a dangerously brilliant person on and off screen. \"She's a very talented actress. She plays this very interesting role and, although I can't reveal much about it, I'm sure audiences are going to love her in the film,\" he said.\nShot on a vast landscape, the story travels from Chennai to Uttarakhand. \"You could call it a road film but it also features a fresh romantic track. Samantha and I fall in love but we don't express our feelings. There are no duets.\nIt's a journey of two extremely opposite strangers,\" he signed off.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T06:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:05:32.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
