They want to expand discussions about bullying and suicide, in an effort to prevent these tragedies. I applaud their honesty and openness. We need more of it. Recent school killings have prompted reports on the role of bullying in the perpetrators’ lives, and often these gunmen take their own lives. Discussions ensue about warning signs and the need for more thorough, preventive responses. We need more of it.\nUnfortunately, it is also commonly accepted that we live with a high level of stress--our children, whether in poverty or upper middle class families, are more anxious and pressured than previous generations; adults are overworked, either on call 24/7 or holding down multiple jobs; tweens and teens are hyper-connected through social media and bombarded with adult issues and lifestyles through video and song, the street and movies; and our news is filled with fractious wars, desperate refugees and crumbling economies. Children learn early on how safe or unsafe their world is, as well as how strong or weak their supports are. Life is stressful for the average person, and then we also know that people are hardwired differently, more or less able to handle stress, change and disruption.\nBullying and suicide can be outcomes of unaddressed mental health issues, but stating that is hardly new. We know that mental health and mental illness play a significant role in these tragedies, but very little is done beyond the headlines. Steadily, mental health services have been defunded in state and county budgets while the demand for counselors and treatment programs has increased. New York requires schools to track bullying and harassment incidents and provides guidance on intervention; additional staff is not included. At the same time, the standard advice to someone in trouble is “ask for help.” Suicidal teenagers should be referred to a therapist; bullies should be referred to school administration; victims should go to an adult and get help. But where is that help? Who can help? The number of professional services needed is exponential: school social workers, long-term individual therapy, support groups, respite services, skills groups, addiction recovery, PTSD counselling, family counselling, arts therapy, mentor relationships, etc. It takes a village of professionals to reach all the people who need to be reached, whose actions could one day be disastrous to themselves or to others. What kind of help do these professionals have to offer? How much do we know about what works?\nI care about this because forty years ago I lost a brother to suicide, twenty-five years ago I lost a father to alcoholism, and currently, several family members suffer from debilitating depression and anxiety. My cousin’s adult son is frequently homeless and aggressive due to his schizophrenia. A former student killed herself. And I juggle multiple therapists and programs for my own child’s mental health issues. Bullying and suicide are the tip of the iceberg. The ripples that spread out from them and the hard-to-find base of that iceberg require much more than asking for help. Funding and research is needed, to address mental health issues as well as social conditions that are harmful to our well-being. We do need to talk about it. It’s the Cadys’ issue. It’s my issue. It’s your neighbor’s issue. And if it’s your issue, I only wish it were more comfortable to talk about.\nMaeve Cullinane Editorial blogger: MORE FROM Editorial Democratic Presidential Circus Bob Bolier, ROC | 1:25 PM Oct 14, 2015 The elephant in the room Jim Ryan Jr., blogger | 9:28 AM Oct 13, 2015 Show Me The Smile Andrea Raethka, ROC | 4:48 PM Oct 6, 2015 See all posts from Blogs Extra", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d41b7168df03dec3aef6007853189c6e7c0de0b7/c=0-0-2273-2273&r=1024x1024&r=103&c=0-0-100-100/local/-/media/2015/02/25/Rochester/Rochester/635604692483421115-cullinane.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-18T20:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:05:24.247+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
