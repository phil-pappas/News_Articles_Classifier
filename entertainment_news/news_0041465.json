Its most recent work is a renovation of prosthetic limbs for kids.\nOpenBionics , a Bristol, England organization that creates prosthetic limbs and hands for amputees at a more affordable cost than most options, has just released three new arm models for children based on famed Disney films. \nThis is what we do... #3Dprinting #bionic hands for #amputees . pic.twitter.com/XE9x4Z8EjZ \n— Open Bionics (@openbionics) August 28, 2015 Young Marvel fans will be able to wear a red \"Iron Man\"-inspired bionic arm (not unlike the one Robert Downey Jr. delivered to a little boy earlier this year) complete with a vibrating light repulsor .\nThere are other options too for non-superhero buffs. \"Frozen\" devotees can try an arm modeled after Elsa's twinkling blue sleeve, and \"Star Wars\" Jedi-in-training can wear a space-suit inspired grey arm with internal LED lights.\nIntroducing the bionic #IronMan hand, the #StarWars lightsaber hand & from Disney’s #Frozen , the Snowflake hand. pic.twitter.com/rJ5CSuU4PK \n— Open Bionics (@openbionics) October 8, 2015 Probably the best part of this partnership, though, is the cost of the prosthetics. Where traditional models can cost up to $20,000, those designed by OpenBionics will only set the wearer back a relatively inexpensive $3,000. They'll be up for sale soon, too. As reported by CNET , these Disney models will likely be available for purchase by the end of 2016.\nAlthough other companies have in the past built prosthetics with superhero themes (as in the above Iron Man example), this is the first company to officially work with Disney.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:31:02.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
