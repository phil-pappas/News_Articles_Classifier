I want my fans to be proud of me and see a lot of positive things in my personal evolution.'' \nThe 'Come and Get It' hitmaker always tries to be ''true to herself'' and be confident in her choices. \nShe told LOOK magazine: ''One thing I believe is very important is to always be true to yourself. You also have to think very hard about who you are and who you want to be in life. \n''Those are the hard questions we all deal with but it's better to face up to them than let yourself keep making mistakes and becoming disillusioned. I believe we're happier when we feel confident and beautiful and comfortable with who we are.''
