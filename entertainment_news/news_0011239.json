Online \"It's two years later, and they've both moved on to other things. But something's always in the air and when they cross paths again, we'll see what happens. I'm excited to see where their paths cross.\" \nIt appears that it is not just Quinn that Carrie will have to deal with. The trailer also has the CIA Berlin Station Chief Allison Carr, played by Miranda Otto, instruct her team to \"keep an eye out for Carrie Mathison.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T12:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:16:03.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
