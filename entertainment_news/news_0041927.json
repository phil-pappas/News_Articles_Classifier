Travis confirmed their relationship during a phone interview on \"The MMA Hour\" on Monday, October 12. \"Dating is for children,\" he shared. \"Dating is for kids.\" \"Over the summer, through all the s**t that I had to shuffle through, that I had to sift through, Ronda and I started talking throughout the summer and I'll say now that we are together,\" the 33-year-old UFC star explained, \"She's my woman and I'm her man. There's no boyfriend, girlfriend stuff. There's no dating. We're together.\" When asked if they experienced an awkward situation when they were training at the same gym to prepare for fight, Travis replied, \"It's not weird. It's not something we have to adjust to. We've been doing that the entire time that I was here. She was doing her camps, I was doing mine without that thought process going through our head.\" \"There isn't a single damn thing, unless it has to do with a family member on their deathbed, that's going to distract me from those two hours and being focused in that gym. When my coach talks, I listen. When he's working with somebody else, I'm watching,\" he explained. \"The same goes for her and she's actually been a great example of that, of just being ultra focused and being borderline obsessive with training. And it's not weird at all. Like I said, we didn't start off interested in each other and now we have to work together. We worked together when we were just acquaintances.\" Travis opened up about how he started falling in love with Ronda. \"Not once did we ever think about this,\" he shared. \"It wasn't even a thought that went through our heads at all. So I've gotten to know her through the gym, through all that kind of stuff. I see her for who she is. The fact that she's out there winning ESPYS and the star she is on the movie screen and all that kind of stuff, that's all great.\" \"But that's not who I know her as, if that makes sense. I know her as one of the hardest working athletes that I've ever seen, in this gym busting her butt on a daily basis. And through our own personal experiences of how compassionate and really how much of a sweetheart she really is. That's what a lot of people don't see out of her. They see that, but they don't really get to experience that,\" he continued. \"She's a huge star and that's great for her and I'm happy for her,\" he said. \"I want nothing to do but support that aspect in her life.\" Travis has been separated from his wife Jenna Renee Webb since June after she accused him of domestic violence back in July. UFC conducted a third-party investigation to the issue and no conclusive evidence was found. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:12:04.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
