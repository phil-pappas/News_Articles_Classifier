Blaine McCartney/Wyoming Tribune Eagle A group of tweens and teens huddle around a table on a Thursday afternoon on the second floor of the Laramie County Library. They look determined. They're ready to battle.Although they're not out for blood, they're out to become the next great Pokemon master. The Laramie County Library began a card game league for teens in the summer of 2014, according to teen services coordinator Andrew Asquith. Sessions are held every Thursday at the library from 4-6 p.m.Some of the kids got their starts with the game by playing at Gryphon Games and Comics downtown, but others just wandered in and learned - the library offers loaner decks to those getting started. Many said they had never played the Pokemon video games, such as the more recently released games, Alpha Sapphire and Omega Ruby.How is the game played? It's a game of strategy, played on collectable cards that players can trade on the side. To play, there are 60 cards to a deck. Each player tries to battle each other with six cards by working to knock out their opponent.Mercadez Burdick, 18, said she has been playing since she was 8. She now has around 600 cards, and tries to get a new deck when she has the money. She said the people and the cute cards has kept her coming back and playing the game after a decade.\"It helps with academics like math and reading, hand-eye coordination,\" she said.Burdick said the league has helped her socially, as well, and it is something she looks forward to during the week.\"Outside of this group, I'm really a mouse,\" she said.Burdick, being one of the few girls in the league, said she likes to disprove the stereotype that Pokemon is a \"boys' game,\" which she said her brother likes to tell her.Nathaniel Roof, 14, started playing when he was 8, but joined the league when it started, saying it was the second time he had played the card game.He said he wanted to start playing because the game is a family event at his house. He said the library league has helped him learn to be a better Pokemon trainer, and he has since be able to defeat two of his siblings. He said he's been collecting more cards since joining the league, bringing his count to 360. Since Roof is homeschooled, the league gives him a chance to get out and make new friends.\"I've learned a lot of the rules from here, mainly,\" Roof said.He said he still wasn't sure if he wanted to become a Pokemon gym leader, a more experienced trainer that acts as a boss. But perhaps one day he would, he said. Pokemon Card Game League Weekly game sessions for those ages 12-17 are free, with tournaments on the last Thursday of the month. Loaner decks are available to those learning to play. Thursdays, 4-6 p.m. Second floor of the Laramie County Library, 2200 Pioneer Ave. More info: www.laramiecountylibrary.org or call Andrew Asquith at 634-3561.   07:13:45 pm MDT Ellen Fike", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:45:14.905+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
