The 25- year -old wouldn't think twice before saying what's on her mind; be it calling herself a major foodie who eats like a caveman or sharing the experience of her peeing her pants when young. \nIt's hard to imagine someone so laid back and blunt do justice to every role they play! No one could possibly think of finding any major flaws in her acting skills. Let's take a look at some of the major roles our beautiful JLaw has played: \nAmerican Hustle Who could have played the role of a desperate housewife better than her? Sporting the blonde hairdo, maxi dresses and gowns from the 90s, she has done a brilliant job! Bradley Cooper only made us want to watch the movie time and again. Sigh! such talented and amazingly good looking beings. \nSilver Linings Playbook Here she carries a goth look and plays the role of Tiffany, who has a very damaged reputation post her husband's death in an accident. She's also managed to get a lot of attention in the dance rehearsal scenes by shaking her booty real good. And just like a cherry on top of the cupcake, Bradley Cooper yet again managed to steal our hearts. Both have done justice to their characters and managed to look messed up and mentally ill, yet sexy. \nThe Hunger Games: Trilogy Belonging from one of the poorest districts in the movie, the actress has managed to look as tough as the character demands. From flaunting her archery skills to fighting the other tributes, she's managed to bring Katniss Everdeen to life. The brunette look suits her role very well. For those who don't know, she chopped her hair off after the movie and carried it on a TV show. Yes, that's how quirky and happy go lucky JLaw is. \nWe can't wait no more to watch her in Passengers that's scheduled for release in 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T15:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:28:18.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
