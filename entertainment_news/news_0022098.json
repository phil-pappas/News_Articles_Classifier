New families and young workers returning to their home turf or moving from other local cities are choosing Victor, Farmington and other surrounding towns for their low property taxes, good schools and countryside with easy city access.\nVictor has been the leader in population growth — the town and village combined ballooned from 5,784 people to over 14,275 since 1980, a 147 percent increase — and Farmington and East Bloomfield also saw upward trends.\n“It’s definitely booming,” said Laura Randall, 35, who lives in Victor’s Quail Ridge neighborhood with husband Erik and their three children. “At least in our development, only younger families are moving in.”\nThe Randalls moved back east from Chicago three years ago for Erik Randall’s job in Seneca Falls. They found Victor to be a central location close to extended family, job locations and schools, Laura Randall said.\n“The more we looked at houses here, the more we seemed to be connected to it,” she said.\nBuy Photo Laura and Erik Randall read a children's book to their kids Evan, 5, Liam, 4 months, and Elise, 3, at their home in Victor.

The plan identifies a desire to transfer additional housing density from places where open space is desired to more appropriate locations, she said.\nOne of the community's recent home runs has been the downtown wine walks, said Cameron Smith, 26, who rents a townhouse with his girlfriend, Danielle Munson, off of East Street in the village of Victor.\n“Wine and craft beer are a big trend right now, and I see Victor capitalizing on that trend,” Smith said.\nHe chose to move to Victor after growing up in Honeoye Falls and spending a few years in Watertown. It’s close to work — both he and Munson work at Northwestern Mutual in Fairport — and is a prime area to consider settling down in eventually, he said.\n“We’re still in the looking process, but we at least want to be able to plant our roots, and Victor’s got what we’re looking for,” he said.\nThe only downside is the drive to and from Rochester, he said. But when it comes to downtown destinations, Victor itself has a lot to offer in excellent restaurants and bars.\nDEMOCRATANDCHRONICLE.COM\nReal Estate Database\n“One of the best things is that with every experience we’ve had at businesses, everyone’s really personable … it’s got that small-town feel,” said Smith.\n“One of the best things is that with every experience we’ve had at businesses, everyone’s really personable … it’s got that small-town feel.”\nCameron Smith, 26 For business owners, the area is an attractive mix of affordable spaces and proximity to large metropolitan areas, said Katie Wadhams of Phelps, who recently opened Lovely Bride bridal shop in the village of Victor.\n“I wanted to be someplace that was accessible for people, that was also reasonably priced,” she said.\nLocal economic development officials were proactive and accommodating in helping her start a small business in the area, she said. The store brings in brides from Rochester, Buffalo and Syracuse.\nWhile the Randalls weren’t looking to live in the sticks, they wanted a place with more space than many Rochester suburbs — “I don’t know if I would call it ‘country,’ but it’s a little less dense” than Monroe County, Laura Randall said.\nIt’s less dense and less expensive, said Pat Coleman, 30, who decided to move to the area from Brighton in 2012 after checking out other Monroe County suburbs.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nEastview Mall had big effect on Victor\nBuy Photo Pat and Kelly Coleman get a smile from their 10-month old son Evan at their Victor home.

The Colemans and their 10-month-old son, Evan, live on four acres in East Bloomfield just across the Victor town line.\nHe estimates he’s saving thousands of dollars in property taxes per year after his move to Ontario County. East Bloomfield town residents pay a combined town-county rate of $9.73 per $1,000 of assessed value, whereas a resident of Brighton would pay a rate of $14.12 per $1,000.\nVictor town residents pay a town-county rate of $7.10 per $1,000. Village residents pay a combined village, town and county rate of $11.45 per $1,000.\nThe family does their shopping and workouts in Victor, and while Coleman gets annoyed with village traffic and the lack of a nearby Wegmans, he doesn’t have many other complaints. Their location on Strong Road allows easy access to local parks and Canandaigua Lake.\nVictor didn’t used to be as congested as it is, but traffic hasn’t deterred Michael Condon, 29, from settling in his hometown — “I’ve always thought it was a great place to live,” he said.\nHe and his wife, Jamie, moved to a suburban neighborhood off Route 96 in Farmington about five years ago, and are now looking to move their family of four to a home in Victor with more land.\nThe town and village are still in the “infancy stages” of attracting young professionals to the downtown area with activities like the wine walks, but these efforts may be gaining some traction, Condon said.\n“They’ve never had those things before,” he said. “There’s been a changeover in trying to get the young blood involved … and I think it’s picking up speed.”\nThough the town plans to put some weight behind becoming a destination for young professionals, that task is already taking care of itself, said Randall.\n“Honestly, they don’t need to do a lot of attraction,” she said. “It’s a hotspot and it has been for a while.”\nSTADDEO@Gannett.com", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/08/Rochester/Rochester/635799143873739977-LP-Victor-YPs-A-100715-Metro.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e7c866b662bebf1efe4447b572ca408abb4efcc0/c=170-0-2830-2000&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/08/Rochester/Rochester/635799143873739977-LP-Victor-YPs-A-100715-Metro.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/23/Rochester/Rochester/635786365885042795-CO-YoungPros-092315-A-Bus.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e94fcffe3ce0ffecfee87bb20ebdfe07b7628d10/r=300/http/nydatabases.com/sites/all/themes/ny_databases/img/nydatabases_promo.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5a711bacabb01b7ac0cc1f3c73097e8b55dcdce9/r=500x394/local/-/media/2015/09/23/Rochester/Rochester/635786365885042795-CO-YoungPros-092315-A-Bus.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/378824a3f9de03346fd91090f11431bac4d74985/c=0-120-4275-3334&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/09/23/Rochester/Rochester/635786365885042795-CO-YoungPros-092315-A-Bus.jpg", "http://www.victorny.org/index.aspx?nid=261", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/08/Rochester/Rochester/635799143873739977-LP-Victor-YPs-A-100715-Metro.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8d4fc75206eda2308f5d35e4dcb0728dca91b76e/c=0-940-2448-2323&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/10/02/Rochester/Rochester/635793894267323123-Smith.jpg", "http://rochester.nydatabases.com/database/real-estate-database", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d20dfccb6c45e7314bffac256f74fe29f633cab7/c=240-0-2600-2360/local/-/media/2015/09/22/Rochester/B9318877509Z.1_20150922114342_000_GV2C0EN7P.1-0.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T17:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:03:32.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
