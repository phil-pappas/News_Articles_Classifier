Most of the masks exhibited at the museum come from his personal collection of masks that he started about 35 years ago. There are several masks from other collectors. \nThe very first mask in Ibold's extensive collection came from a most unlikely place. Adamstown, Pa. \n\"I was at Renningers with my wife Regine and another couple, and I came upon this colorful mask from Mexico,\" said the retired advertising artist and adman. \"It was like a work of art. So I bought it.\" \nLike all collectors, something happened that drove Ibold to keep collecting Mexican masks. He was intrigued with the colors and designs and materials used mostly by indigenous people of Mexico. \nThey were made in the likeness of many creatures and people, such as snakes, jaguars, lizards, frogs, goats, sheep, frogs, senoritas, senors, skeletons, and even el diablo - Spanish for the devil. Some are friendly and whimsical, while others are scary and more than a bit creepy. \nThree of his Mexican masks came from a \"hippy\" shop in Lancaster. When he first saw them, he bought one. Then he went back for two more. \n\"I adored them,\" he says, adding that deep down he believes that his obsession with masks might indicate that he is \"a little bit nutty.\" \nIbold has written a book \"Masks of the World,\" which he will sign on October 22 during a meet-the-author event at the museum. He also has developed a web site, masksoftheworld.com , with masks from all over the world. \nWhile Ibold has researched the history, culture and anthropology of masks in the cultures of Mexico, South America, India and Asia, he admits that he is most interested in the artistic aspect of the masks, which are like sculptures made from wood, papier-mâché, leather, cloth, ceramic and metal. \nHe loves the unexpected color combinations, like bright turquoise accented by crimson red, or vivid blue with orange and yellow. An entire collection of jaguars are painted brilliant yellow with playful black spots and mystical cat eyes. \n\"I can't really say I have a favorite,\" says Ibold, adding that his first mask still holds a spot in his heart. It's a two-faced mask with an angry looking sun surrounded by red rays with a face that has angel wings at each side of its head. \"I love the color and the eyes.\" \nWhen museum executive director Anne Lampe heard about Ibold's collection, she invited him to display them at the museum. As she points out, the exhibit focuses on the masks that are used in the many rituals and celebrations performed in Mexico. \n\"Bringing this large of a collection of masks from one country allows us an intimate view of their use in rituals,\" says Lampe. \nMasks of Mexico Exhibition", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:20:24.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
