Public viewing of the relics began at 9 a.m. Wednesday and would continue until midnight, with a Mass at 7 p.m.\nMore than 500 people per hour had been filing into the church, 15050 Wolf Road, according to The Rev. Carlos Martins, coordinator of the national tour of the relics, which is visiting 54 cities in 55 days. In the 20 cities visited so far, more than 100,000 people had venerated the relics, he said.\nKnown as the Little Saint of Great Mercy, Goretti was 11 years old when she was stabbed to death in 1902 after she had resisted the sexual advances of a 20-year-old neighbor, Alessandro Serenelli.\nGoretti is believed to have forgiven Serenelli, reportedly appearing to him as an apparition while he was in prison and giving him 14 white lilies, the number representing the number of times she was stabbed.\n\"In our world, forgiveness is a very uncommon thing,\" Maureen Neidle, of Palos Hills, said after seeing the relics. \"It gives us all a lesson in how to live. Our world is so angry these days.\"\nYoung saint's remains Gary Middendorf / Daily Southtown The remains of St. Maria Goretti were on display Wednesday at St. Francis of Assisi Church in Orland Park. The remains of St. Maria Goretti were on display Wednesday at St. Francis of Assisi Church in Orland Park. (Gary Middendorf / Daily Southtown) People pressed hands, rings, rosary beads and prayer cards to the top of the casket as they silently filed by. At one point in the morning, a line waiting to enter the church stretched toward the parking lot.\n\"To actually see a saint, I've never experienced that before,\" Chuck Gestner, of New Lenox, said.\nJust four churches in the Chicago area are part of the tour. Apart from St. Francis of Assisi, the relics had been displayed at St. John Cantius on Chicago's North Side, St. John Vianney in Northlake and are to be available for viewing from 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. Thursday at St. Mary Immaculate Church, 15629 Illinois 59, Plainfield.\nThe Rev. Artur Sowa, of St. Francis, said the size of the crowd \"really is impressive,\" although the church had expected significant numbers of people to come. Many area churches had hoped to be selected.\nMartins said he travels to more than 120 churches around the United States annually, and that he \"wanted churches that could pull this off; I wanted the maximum number of pilgrims to be accommodated.\"\nIt is the first time the saint's relics have been in the United States, and only the second time they have traveled outside of Italy.\nRaeAnn Murphy said that her mother, Audrey, watched television news reports about the arrival in the Chicago area of the relics.\n\"She told me I had to bring her,\" Murphy said.\nHer 88-year-old mother, pushed by Murphy in a wheelchair, was nearly in tears after seeing the saint's remains and touching the casket.\n\"It was beautiful,\" Audrey Murphy said.\nDenise Bobin, of Homewood, said she came to the Orland Park church because \"I wanted to be part of something amazing, something that gives you hope and faith.\"\nShe said that Goretti's ability to forgive her murderer \"is a big accomplishment for someone so young,\" and she hoped that the tour of the relics \"will bring a lot of people back to the Catholic Church.\"\nWhile the Vatican declares patron saints of specific causes, Catholics often cling to a saint's story for inspiration, and Goretti has been called the patron saint of rape victims, purity and prison inmates. At the early stages of the tour, the relics were brought to New York's Sing Sing prison, where they were seen by inmates, according to organizers.\nThe tour of the relics coincides with Pope Francis' Holy Year of Mercy, which begins Dec. 8 during the feast of the Immaculate Conception.\nContributing: Chicago Tribune\nmnolan@tribpub.com\nCopyright Â© 2015, Daily Southtown", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561ea2d0/turbine/ct-sta-saint-goretti-at-orland-church-st-1015-20151014", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561eb95e/turbine/ct-ct-sta-saint-goretti-at-orland-c-10-jpg-20151014"], "published": "2015-10-14T23:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:26:37.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
