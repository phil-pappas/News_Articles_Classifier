Clients were going to other crisis management firms and OPA was stretched beyond capacity. \nSo Quinn, acting as the new HBIC, suggested hiring Marcus Walker, whom they have helped in the past -- when he was caught in his own scandal, sleeping with the mayor's wife. Quinn, offering him the job, said: \"You will change lives. You will slay dragons. Do you wanna be a gladiator in a suit?\" \n\"No,\" he replied, much to her surprise. \"You're shifty. You're shady. You lie when you don't have to.\" \nMeanwhile, former B613 head Jake Ballard visited Olivia's father, Eli, in jail to tell him \"someone launched Lazarus One.\" We have no idea what that means, but next thing you know Jake is tapping agent Charlie to head to Europe with him to fix things. When they arrive, we're introduced to another agent, Elise. We eventually found out that Elise is Jake's wife, whom he thought was killed in an earlier mission. \"I really thought you were dead,\" he told her. \"I grieved. I really loved being married to you.\" But later when she tried her hand at another mission she got shot. Will Jake lose her a second time? \nBack in Washington, Liv told Fitz she found \"it offensive\" that he wanted to help her deal with the fallout from revealing she was his mistress. But soon, Fitz would discover she really did need him when she called him in the middle of the night on the verge of tears after reading nasty Internet comments about herself. But she tells Fitz not to worry: \"I'm losing it, but only a little bit.\" \nOn the hill, the women of the Senate wanted to impeach Fitz, but wouldn't do it unless they had the approval from the junior Senator-slash-first lady Mellie Grant. Initially she refused, saying she wanted to keep a \"low profile.\" Her new aid Cyrus Beene tried to convince her to impeach him, which would pave the way for her eventually climb to the Oval Office. Cyrus told Mellie to do it because \"you did not love him.\" In fact, he tried to prove how he loved Fitz more, like a son. He later quit. It got too weird, especially after Cyrus compared his grief of losing his job as chief of staff to Mellie losing her son. \nFitz met with the Republicans on the Hill and they asked him to kill the Brandon Bill, his legacy. It's the bill that holds police accountable for police brutality. \"This isn't politics. This is extortion,\" he told the head negotiator. \n\"We've all had dalliances. you just got caught,\" one of the senators told Fitz, who added that next time the president should \"choose a girl that's more palatable to the base.\" \nTuh! \nEventually, Marcus came around and joined OPA, saying he wanted to \"help a sista'.\" OPA then went on the offensive by going on the network's talk shows and defending Liv. With Marcus leading the charge, they accused the news of painting Olivia as an arrogant seductress, often using the term \"dog whistle politics.\" \nLater, Fitz determined that he wasn't going to kill the Brandon Bill and instead drove right over to Liv's house -- in the presidential motorcade -- to check on his girlfriend. He must've been really happy to go public with Liv because he called her his girlfriend about five times in five seconds! \nStill, one man's happiness is another woman's scorn. After that stunt, Mellie told the women of the Senate to go ahead and impeach Fitz. \nFind out what happens next when Scandal returns Thursday at 9 p.m. Eastern on ABC. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
