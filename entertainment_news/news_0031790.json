The reports said they have a son, who is now 12 years old.

They told her she was married and she denies she ever got married,” Faisal said.”We also showed her the photograph published in the Indian media in which they claim the girl is Geeta. But when we showed her this photograph she said the girl was not her,” he said.Faisal acknowledged that the situation is a bit complicated now as arrangements have been made to send Geeta to New Delhi on October 26. \n“We are trying to speak to her to find out if she is hiding anything from us or misleading anyone,” he added.Pakistan and India have begun arrangements to bring Geeta back home after she recognised her family in a photograph sent to the Edhi Foundation by the Indian High Commission.Geeta was reportedly 7 or 8-years-old when Pakistani Rangers found her sitting alone in the Samjhauta Express at Lahore railway station about 14 years ago. \nPolice took Geeta to Edhi Foundation in Lahore and later shifted her to Karachi. She was adopted by the foundation’s Bilquees Edhi and lives with her in Karachi.”Bilquees Edhi who has raised Geeta as her daughter will hopefully accompany her to New Delhi and we will like to first see the DNA tests done to confirm the family in the photograph is indeed Geeta’s mother and relatives before she is handed over to them,” Faisal said. \n  1:07 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T10:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:14:01.581+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
