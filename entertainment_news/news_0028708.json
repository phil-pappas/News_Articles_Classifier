At a glittering ceremony attended by Universal Music South Asia's MD and CEO, Devraj Sanyal, Anu, Mohit Marwah (Fugly) and lyricist Manoj Muntashir (Galliyan of Ek Villain), Mohit launched the new singer's debut single Lamhein.\nAn official adaptation of Paradise, much-loved British rock band Coldplay's super hit number, Lamhein is a tribute to them. An avid Coldplay fan, Anmoll has created her version of the core melody with romantic lyrics. The video tells a tale about a simple girl who has music in her soul and is consumed by a dream. It turns into reality when Mohit Marwah blazes into her life and puts her in the spotlight.\nPleased that Anmoll is the face and voice for his first non-film project, Mohit, who has also directed the video, says, \"She has an honest voice and her dedication will ensure an incredible career ahead. While directing Lamhein, I felt the same spontaneity and energy I felt while filming Aashiqui 2. I hope everyone relates to the story and emotions in the video.\"\nAnmoll adds, \"This song is about all the precious moments that we need to cherish before they turn into distant memories.\" Devraj Sanyal sums up, \"This is an amazing beginning for the label. Mohit and I expect it to be a one-of-its-kind bridge between the non-film music world and mainstream Bollywood music. We are very excited to launch a roster of super talented artists who will emerge from the label in future.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:32:13.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
