Italians have brought a rich culture to the city, along with such luminaries as Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, sportscaster Harry Caray, activist Florence Scala, actors Joe Mantegna and Dennis Farina. And there's much more:\n1. Antonio Pasin, who grew up near Venice, immigrated to Chicago after his parents sold their mule to help pay his passage. Once here, Pasin pioneered another type of transportation, creating the Radio Flyer red wagon in the early 1930s. Pasin's company is still based in Chicago, with his grandson Robert as \"chief wagon officer.\"\nRadio Flyer wagon Radio Flyer Chicago-based Radio Flyer traces its roots to 1917, when Italian immigrant Antonio Pasin began making wagons.

Not the least of Mother Frances Xavier Cabrini's many feats in the course of helping the poor and needy around the world was that she embarked on 25 trans-Atlantic voyages despite being deathly afraid of water.\n3. One of baseball's first Italian-American major leaguers was Ping Bodie, who joined the Chicago White Sox in 1911. Born Francesco Stephano Pezzolo, he took the name \"Ping\" for the sound his bat made and \"Bodie\" for the California town where he once lived. Despite the name change, Bodie's Italian identification was genuine: He once defeated an ostrich in a pasta-eating contest.\nPing Bodie Chicago History Museum Ping Bodie of the Chicago White Sox is seen at Comiskey Park in May 1911.

Vito Marzullo long served as a City Council heavyweight. Immigrating to the U.S. as a child, he became an unabashed defender of the machine and boasted in 1971 that he could stay in office even if \"you can take all your news media and all the do-gooders in town and move them into my 25th Ward.\" But by the mid-'80s he stepped down amid redistricting, saying, \"They redrew my ward and they used cats and dogs and mouses and counted them as people.\"\n5. Unfortunately, the most famous Chicagoan of Italian descent is probably Al Capone, whose murderous gang of bootleggers terrorized the city in the 1920s. Far less known is the fact that one of Capone's brothers, Frank Vincenzo Capone, moved to Nebraska and became a police officer known as Richard \"Two-Gun\" Hart. In contrast to his brother, Hart cracked down on moonshiners.\n6. Al's #1 Italian Beef says its founders invented the signature Chicago sandwich in 1938, when slicing the meat thin was a Depression-era necessity. The roast beef is soaked in meat juice, then placed in Italian bread. It is often served \"with hot,\" which means with giardiniera, a condiment made of pickled vegetables. Because the sandwich is messy, Al's recommends eating it while in \"the Stance\" — leaning forward with forearms on the counter, so the food doesn't spill on your clothes.\n7. In 1947, the Marchese family on the West Side received cablegrams and a letter from relatives in Genoa, Italy, asking if they had survived a terrible earthquake that had set off devastating fires in Chicago. There had indeed been a quake in the Midwest, but it merely had broken a few dishes in Ohio and was not the \"apocalyptic\" event that an Italian newspaper had described. The Marcheses assured their relatives they were all right.\n8. Helen Cirese, who in 1921 became the youngest woman to receive a law license in Illinois, went on to have a distinguished 62-year legal career. It started out with a bang. In 1924, she was part of a team that successfully appealed the conviction (and first-ever death sentence for a woman) of an Italian immigrant who had been accused of killing her husband. Later she became a judge in her native Oak Park. Even so, the law wasn't her first choice. Back in high school, she confessed to one of the editors of Oak Park High School's student newspaper that she was going to be a newspaper reporter. \"So am I,\" said Ernest Hemingway.\nHelen Cirese Helen Cirese, who in 1921 became the youngest woman to receive a law license in Illinois, is seen in a 1961 photo.

Balbo Drive, named for Italo Balbo after he led an armada of 24 seaplanes from Italy to Chicago for the Century of Progress Exposition in 1933, faced its fiercest renaming campaign in 1946 when the horrors of World War II were fresh in residents' memories. Veterans groups, academics, the PTA, Balbo Drive property owners, and notably Italian-American groups and a number of high-profile Italian-American civic leaders argued passionately for the change, saying no right-minded resident would be upset. But Mayor Edward Kelly, who as a newly minted Chicago mayor had partied with Balbo in 1933, blocked any name change, bizarrely arguing that the general wasn't a fascist.\nStagg field Argonne National Laboratory Vegetation grows on the unused west stands of Stagg Field at the University of Chicago in the mid-1940s.

An Italian-American once held the fate of millions of Chicagoans in his hands. He was Enrico Fermi, the physicist who oversaw the first self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. The curious decision to hold the experiment at the University of Chicago — in the middle of a large city — created great nervousness. But Fermi pushed forward in 1942 after a labor strike delayed plans to conduct the operation in a forest preserve. Fermi's success prompted Arthur Compton of the U. of C. to call James Conant of Harvard with the news, but they had forgotten to set up a code. \"The Italian navigator has landed in the New World,\" Compton ad-libbed. Conant asked: \"How were the natives?\" And Compton answered: \"Very friendly.\"\nMark Jacob is the Chicago Tribune's associate managing editor for metro news; Stephan Benzkofer is the Tribune's weekend editor.
