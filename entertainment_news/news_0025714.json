The video was released to embarrass Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. \nThe BJP had alleged that Nitish Kumar, was promoting superstitious activity and had lost faith in the people. \nHowever the video is not audible but in some parts the tantrik is heard asking Nitish Kumar why he did joined his hands with RJD leader Lalu Prasad and the tantrik uttering, “Nitish Zindabad and Lalu Murdabad”. Also the tantrik is seen hugging and blessing Kumar. \nBJP leaders in Bihar had alleged that Kumar had reached tantrik ‘to get rid’ of Lalu Prasad. \n“Lalu had attacked Prime Minister, said that he knows the formula to ward off evil forces. But before he could do so his younger brother (Nitish Kumar) reached a tantrik to get rid of Lalu Prasad,” Giriraj Singh told reporters. \nUnion Minister Arun Jaitley said, “When the situation is bad, even ‘tantra-mantra’ does not help”. \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi, has called Lalu Yadav a shaitan (devil) to which RJD chief paid the compliment back. The 2015 Bihar elections has seen one of the most low graded language used in past few years. \nNitish Kumar is yet to react to the video which has reportedly gone viral on social media. \nModified Date: October 25, 2015 2:47 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T11:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T11:32:50.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
