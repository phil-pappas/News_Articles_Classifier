Everything you believed in are ruined. Why did you come?\"\n\"I came here to kill you,\" replies Bond, to which Oberhauser says: \"And I thought you came here to die.\"\nThe latest 007 instalment is packed with explosions, glimpses of epic car chases and Bond's witty one-liners, which will satisfy fans of the franchise.\nThe finished trailer follows Smith's Bond track, Writing's On The Wall, making it to number one in the charts - the first James Bond theme to do so.\nThe Spectre track soared straight to the top spot with 70,000 combined sales and streams, finishing 13,000 ahead of closest competitor, Justin Bieber's What Do You Mean?\nSpectre reunites Craig with director Mendes, after 2012's Skyfall became the highest-grossing Bond film in history.\nHowever, it may be their last 007 adventure together, with the film-maker saying Spectre is likely to be his last Bond film, while Craig has also dropped hints.\nNaomie Harris, Ralph Fiennes, Ben Whishaw and Rory Kinnear return for Spectre, alongside newcomers to the franchise such as Christoph Waltz, Andrew Scott, Dave Bautista and Bond girls Lea Seydoux, Monica Bellucci and Stephanie Sigman.\nSpectre opens in cinemas on October 26.\nShare article Watch the trailer here", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/z4UDNzXD3qA"], "published": "2015-10-03T02:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T06:03:40.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
