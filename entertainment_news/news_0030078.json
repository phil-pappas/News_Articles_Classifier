Since it’s an agricultural season, we want to celebrate it and thank our farmers.” The International Agri-Center celebrates the rich history of agriculture during the fall season by hosting its second annual Harvest Festival from 3 p.m. to 9 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 24. \nThis year brings a couple extra surprises. In reality, it’s not candy but farmers who are the reason for the season as they spend it reaping in the efforts of their year-round hard work to make the countless upcoming Thanksgiving dinners a possibility. ‘Dracula’ resurrected at COS Theatre \nAdditionally, this year's Harvest Festival helps another local nonprofit that provides food for people in need, along with so much more, as it has partnered with the Visalia Rescue Mission and invited any other nonprofit organizations in the community. \nIn conjunction with national Make a Difference Day, the International Agri-Center calls for any nonprofit groups to participate in a fundraising opportunity by providing carnival-style games for the event. \nAdmission for adults is $5, but the fee can be waved by simply providing three cans of food. As for the little ones, all children 6-and-under, and all children who come in costume receive free entry. \nOnce through the doors, those who enter are greeted by multiple free activities including a free kids area and hay ride, an antique tractor to gawk over, a classic car display, cost-free carnival games, and live music. \nPerforming this year for the festival is Bakersfield’s Miss Lee who croons all kinds of classic tunes from Dolly Parton to Marilyn Monroe — who might just make an appearance on stage with impersonations throughout the show. She opens for headlining band Take Cover. 'Rocky Horror' invites audiences to do the 'Time Warp' \nAlso free for the young budding farmers is their very own pumpkin. \nAlthough free pumpkins are available while supplies last, Davis asserts that there are \"a good amount of pumpkins.\" \nThey all come courtesy of Van Groningen and Sons, Inc. which has a lush history of farming all its own extending back to 1922 when Henry Van Groningen Sr. established a dairy in Hanford. \nChildren can learn even more about agriculture history when they pick up their free pumpkin at the AgvVentures Learning Center where Aggie, the International Agri-Center's mascot grazes. \nFor its second year, the Harvest Festival isn't only emphasizing the fun to be had by kids, but also the excitement to be had by adults. \n\"We will have beer booths here under our sponsorship with Budweiser, and we will also have wine available as well,\" Davis asserted. 'Woodlawn' a deeply personal story of faith, football \nThis also includes the opportunity for some very early Christmas shopping with numerous boutique shops on site that are all locally based. \nAs for food, the Agri-Center hosts an abundant number of food trucks that surmount that of the previous year including All Fired UP! Pizza, Kona-Ice, Cast-Iron Cobblers, 4S BBQ, among others. \n\"Regardless of age there is something available,\" Davis said. \"The emphasis is placed on the community.\" \nAs a community built upon the work of our farmers, it's a worthy occasion to celebrate the roots of the Central Valley community. It's a reminder that regardless of the spooky ghosts, or the dreaded Grim Reapers present courtesy of the little ones in costume, it's the scarecrows in presence that have done most of the hardest work keeping us, the living, from resting in peace. \nDetails: The International Agri-Center Harvest Festival is 3 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 24. Admission is $5 for adults. Children 6 and under, and children in costume are free. \nIn conjunction with national Make a Difference Day, the International Agri-Center is calling for nonprofit groups to participate in a fundraising opportunity by providing carnival-style games for the event.
