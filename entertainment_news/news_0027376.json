The actress who essays the role of a warrior princess in Bajirao Mastani, met the real-life Princess, Diya Kumari. Deepika Padukone also had the honor of flagging off the Royal polo match at the Rajasthan polo Club, a tradition followed by the royal family for years. The actress then visited City Palace, where Princess Diya Kumari and her guests watched the song for the first time on the Palace walls, adjacent to the Palace lawns. Normally old Rajasthani folk stories are screened and projected on the walls of city palace, and this was the first time Bollywood content was showcased on this platform to over a 100 esteemed guests and royalty. \nDeepika Padukone then joined Princess Diya Kumari for a private meal in her personal dining room. The royal family have been extremely supportive of the film and were happy to open their doors for the launch of the first song from the Sanjay Leela Bhansali film. \nEros International & Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Bajirao Mastani will release worldwide on 18th December 2015 .Starring Ranveer Singh, Deepika Padukone and Priyanka Chopra ,the film has been directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:17:14.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
