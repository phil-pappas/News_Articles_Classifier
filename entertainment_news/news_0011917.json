It's a crowded universe. \n\"I also used to hear from my stepfather going, 'Cyndi, check on mommy, she's not doing so good.' \n\"I'm Italian and Italians - Sicilians especially - we live with the dead.\" \nThe 64-year-old singer also confessed to being a \"scaredy cat\" but never lets her fears hold her back. \nShe said: \"I am a big scaredy cat, scared of everything, but I don't let that change me or stop me. \n\"I don't think about my fear if I'm afraid, I just say that it goes with the territory.\" \nAnd one of the things the 'Girls Just Wanna Have Fun' star is afraid of is death. \nShe told Stylist magazine: \"I've seen people dying and it's not an easy thing. From what I've seen it must be very difficult to die.\" \nCyndi wishes she had a British accent because she thinks her own New York dialect makes her sound \"uneducated\". \nShe said: \"I really wish I could speak the Queen's English rather than Queens from New York. \n\"I hate my accent. It sounds uneducated.\" bang showbiz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T01:11:12.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
