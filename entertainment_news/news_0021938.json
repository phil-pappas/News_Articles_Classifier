Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., was under more pressure than ever to justify his committee's focus on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her role in the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks in Benghazi, Libya, that killed a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans.\nIt showed.\nGowdy, who had said in an interview that these have been \"worst weeks of my life,\" wasted no time in defending the committee's credibility. It came in his opening statement.\n\"Madam Secretary, not a single member of this committee signed up to investigate you or your email,\" Gowdy said in remarks that began what would be a 10-hour marathon. \"We signed up to investigate and therefore honor the lives of four people that we sent into a dangerous country to represent us.\"\nBut the tension never faded between Gowdy and his Democratic committee members. The former federal prosecutor frowned and looked at the ceiling in irritation when the ranking Democrat, Elijah Cummings, D-Md., accused the committee of passing up chances to interview other government officials in order to focus on Clinton herself.\nGowdy used every opportunity he could during the subsequent hours to counter allegations that his investigation has partisan motives -- criticism that intensified in recent weeks as members of his own party applauded the committee for sinking Clinton's poll numbers.\nIndeed, Gowdy took pains at ever turn to justify the probe. After Clinton gave an account of how four Americans lost their lives in the attacks, seeming to catch the Republican members off guard, Gowdy thanked her for pointing out their heroism. Then he used the moment to justify the money spent on his 17-month investigation.\n\"Frankly, it infuriates me to hear folks to my left who don't raise a single whisper about spending $50 million to train five anti-ISIS fighters, but God forbid we spend one-tenth of that to give some answers to the family members sitting in the first row,\" he said.\nFor their part, committee Democrats used every opportunity to bring up what Gowdy's committee has spent -- according to their website, $4,809,839 as of Thursday afternoon.\nCompared to other Republican members of the committee, Gowdy was markedly restrained in his interactions with Clinton. He gave her the unusual option of avoiding the public swearing-in before the hearing.\n\"Chairman Gowdy offered to swear her in, in private, because this is not about politics, it's about the four brave Americans we lost,\" a committee spokesman said.\nGowdy was careful to point out that he would not be cutting Clinton off, and that this was not a prosecution.\nHe methodically interrogated her on why Sidney Blumenthal, a longtime friend of the Clinton family, played such an important role despite not having a formal position in the administration. Blumenthal often sent memos on Libya and other foreign affairs to the private email address that Clinton used for government business while at the State Department.\n\"Help us understand how Sidney Blumenthal had that kind of access to you, Madam Secretary, but the ambassador did not,\" said Gowdy, who seemed more comfortable in the role of interrogator than as chairman running the hearing.\nHe pointed out that Clinton often forwarded emails to other State Department officials without mentioning the source.\n\"I don't know what this line of questioning does to help us get to the bottom the deaths of four Americans,\" Clinton said, getting frustrated with Gowdy's series of questions.\n\"It's relevant because our ambassador was asked to read and respond to Sidney Blumenthal's drivel,\" Gowdy replied.\nThe most dramatic moment of the hearing did not even involve Clinton. A heated exchange about whether to release Blumenthal's previously private testimony devolved into a shouting match between Gowdy and Cummings while Clinton sat back and watched with an amused expression, often nodding and smiling.\n\"I don't care if he sent it by Morse Code, carrier pigeon, smoke signals,\" the usually unruffled Gowdy said, raising his voice and visibly sweating. \"The fact that he happened to send it by email is irrelevant. What is relevant is that he was sending information to the secretary of state.\"\n\"You said from the beginning we want the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth,\" Cummings shot back. \"Why don't we just put the entire transcript out there and let the world see it. What do you have to hide?\"\nDuring the marathon hearing some Republicans voiced their support for Gowdy and the committee's work -- often undermining the chairman's insistence that the probe is apolitical.\n\"Sign and stand with Trey Gowdy as he uncovers the truth about Hillary Clinton's actions as Secretary of State,\" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., tweeted.\nFellow South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham emailed supporters, saying that Gowdy's committee \"has uncovered more facts about what happened in Benghazi than any other investigation has.\"\n\"Those who are calling this committee a partisan attack on Hillary Clinton are simply wrong. Trey Gowdy has done an incredible job, and I can't imagine a better person for this difficult task.\"\nBut praise was not universal among conservatives. Commentator Charles Krauthammer said on Fox News that while Clinton gave a \"gripping performance,\" speaking about spending sleepless nights over the Benghazi attacks, the hearing produced nothing similar for Gowdy's committee.\n\"The only thing that's going to be shown on the committee ... in the clips is going to be that Trey Gowdy interchange with Cummings. Which of course is a conflict reality TV. And a nice little bit of heat, but we're not going to get the contradictions, we're not going to get the facts.\"\n(c)2015 McClatchy Washington Bureau\nVisit the McClatchy Washington Bureau at www.mcclatchydc.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nGRAPHICS (for help with images, contact 312-222-4194): 20151022 Benghazi politics, 20151022 Benghazi committee\nVIDEO (for help with video, contact 312-222-4196): CONGRESS BENGHAZI\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1742062&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1742062", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1742062&h=Gowdy%27s+grilling+of+Clinton+draws+mixed+reviews"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:02:54.999+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
