There are some unusual aspects to it as he told Bookmarks in an email. \"I asked (the publishers) to retain the ebook, to have a reversion of rights built into the contract, and to enter the contract as partners with a 50/50 share of profits, after the novel has repaid all costs. The answers were identical: no ...\"  He signed up with Pan Macmillan in Australia and Little, Brown in Britain, but held back on a deal in the US. His agent was looking for an advance of $2.5 million, but it was the conditions that publishers resented. Eventually in stepped Morgan Entrekin of Grove Press. He couldn't pay that advance, but did agree to those conditions. As Roberts says: \"We did the deal a week later, as business partners rather than as publisher and client writer. This is the first contract of its kind in the English language, with a full reversion of rights after five years, full retention of the ebook, and a 50/50 partnership in profits. My hope, in struggling for this contract (and waving goodbye to $3 million), is that it will open the door to a more dignified and respectful relationship paradigm between writers and publishers.\"   The Mountain Shadow is published under the Picador imprint. \nThe many lives of John le Carre \nJust before Bloomsbury publishes Adam Sisman's biography of John le Carre – real name David Cornwell – comes the news that le Carre is writing a memoir that will be published by Viking next September. In T he Pigeon Tunnel , le Carre writes mainly about his writing life and about the people who inspired his books. Sisman had access to le Carre's archives for his life of the great novelist of the Cold War. And if you're puzzled by his pen name, it's simple. The name was a private joke at the time of his first book, Call for the Dead , in 1961. Originally, he thought he'd be able to \"go on being whatever I was\" in the secret service and write a book every couple of years. But his publisher told him he should choose a name with two Anglo-Saxon monosyllables, such as John Smith. \"I thought, no, what they like is three bits to a name,\" he told Bookmarks a few years ago. \"A kind of reassuring Anglo-Saxon first name, then a little bit in the middle – an American would have an initial, 'von' wouldn't have been popular – and then the 'Carre' was a sort of game I played.\" It means John the Square.\nAdvertisement Svetlana all a Twitter  \nWinning the Nobel prize seems to have excited Twitter novice Svetlana Alexievich (she joined on October 2). Two hours before the announcement was made, the Belarusian journalist tweeted this:  \"Swedish Academy awarded to me the Nobel Prize in Literature 2015. I receive now a call from Sweden. I'm happy, very happy! Thanks.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:20:16.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
