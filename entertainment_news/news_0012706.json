That isn’t new, but Cosmopolitan’ s new cover, showcasing the reality TV family, really bothers America. \nThe magazine put the Kardashian and Jenner women on their 50th anniversary cover. The November issue touts getting sisters Kourtney, Kim, Khloe, Kendall and Kylie, and mom Kris, in a formal photograph, the only one in the last four years. Cosmo promises a photo spread of the women and the tale of their success story. \nIt’s the cover caption that’s upsetting readers. Editors call the Kardashians and Jenners “America’s First Family.\" While Kim's husband Kanye West has declared he’ll run for President, many readers aren’t happy that the magazine compared the entertainment family to the Obamas. \nAccording to USA Today , Cosmo wrote in a statement, “We are teasing!” Spokeswoman Lauren Demitry also wrote, “They are a huge cultural phenomenon. What we do know is there is nothing like the cover of a magazine to provoke a national conversation.\" \nStill, Twitter isn’t having it: May the conversation begin! We're celebrating our 50th BDAY w/the Kardashian/Jenner women http://t.co/QyXZYLdnXT pic.twitter.com/bw4H9TmahX — joanna coles (@JoannaColes) October 5, 2015 @JoannaColes @Cosmopolitan \"America's First Family\" is both factually inaccurate and culturally frightening. — Ken Simon (@KenSimonSays) October 5, 2015 @JoannaColes @Cosmopolitan time to cancel my subscription. 🚮 — Nawty Hawty (@NawtyHawty) October 5, 2015 @JoannaColes @Cosmopolitan Could you be more disrespectful to our actual First Family?
