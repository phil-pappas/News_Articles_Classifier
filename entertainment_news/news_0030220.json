The lovely song ‘Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam’ also has a similar scene where Salman Khan draws Aishwarya close to him by pulling her plaits.\n\nWhat reflected in the eyes of Salman and Aishwarya at that time was true sublime love. But the question here is, will the same magic be recreated with Sonam. \n\nPrem Ratan Dhan Payo is written and directed by Sooraj Barjatya. The film is scheduled to release on November 12 this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:55:08.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
