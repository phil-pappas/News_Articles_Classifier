Pic/Santa Banta \nThe 40-year-old \"Reader\" star has always been very outspoken on her stance against retouching her photographs for magazine spreads and ads, reported E! online.\n\"I can only ever speak for myself and I can only ever do things that are important to me and it's a hope that other people might follow suit but it does feel important to me because I do think we have a responsibility to the younger generation of women,\" Winslet said.\n\"I think they do look to magazines, I think they do look to women who have been successful in their chosen careers and they want people to look up to, and I would always want to be telling the truth about who I am to that generation because they've got to have strong leaders. We're all responsible for raising strong young women, so these are things that are important to me.\"\nWinslet has expressed these sentiments for years. Back in 2009, the celeb shared during an interview that she would ask photos be reverted to their original state after seeing her face retouched, and explained that ageing doesn't have to be a bad thing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:54:22.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
