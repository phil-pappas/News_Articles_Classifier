An extra was sacked from the production after posting on Instagram a picture of a bag of weed from the movie set and thanked Zac Efron for it. \"Thanks for the weed Zac Efron! BTW it's only a prop, people,\" the unnamed individual wrote as quoted by TMZ. Although he clearly stated that the weed was fake, his joke wasn't appreciated by the producers since it was a sensitive subject for the actor. Efron has been open about his struggle with alcohol and drug addictions. He quietly entered rehab in 2013. He said of his journey of self discovery, \"When you have success young, and you accept the good things, you have to accept all of it. You have to accept the moments of glory but also a great responsibility. And that responsibility, to some degree, involves being a role model.

I've learned from each one.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Neighbors 2 News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T15:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T21:50:30.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
