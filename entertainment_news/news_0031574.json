(Hello! Magazine/PA) \nShe told Hello! magazine: “Even after our divorce, we remained very good friends. He would come to this house often. \n“That’s one reason why I can never leave this place – I have too many memories here. \n“I have been here since 1973 and I raised both my children here, so it’s really hard for me to leave. This is homey and it still feels right for me.” (Hello! Magazine/PA) \nShe said Elvis, who died in 1977, was her one great love. \n“We were very, very close. I loved him with all my heart.
