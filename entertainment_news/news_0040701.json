Photo: Supplied \n\"I would like to start off by being in state, federal and I'd like to make my way up to the very top spot. That would [be] my dream come true,\" Mr Mehajer said as he stood at the lectern, notes in hand, addressing a lone reporter. A single Nine News mic propped up in front of him. \nAdvertisement Mr Mehajer made a  failed bid for the seat of Auburn in the 2011 state election, but on Monday night he set his sights further skyward.\n\"I don't believe I have what it takes to be a superstar but we'll see what happens. If an opportunity knocks on my door I'm always willing for a challenge,\" he said.\nHis wife Aisha had been positioned in-camera shot by his shoulder, at her husband's suggestion.\n\"Yeah, why not she should probably step back, though, like two metres,\" Mehajer told the Nine News reporter before the wide-ranging formal interview began. \n\"I only showed the world how a female should be treated,\" Mr Mehajer said of his extravagant wedding, as Aisha stood silently to his right (two metres behind him). \nThe interview comes amid claims that he threatened the family of a Sydney Siege survivor Joel Herat.\n\"Not only are these allegations false and misleading but they are sheer evil and unAustralian,\" he said.\nMr Mehajer has previously denied the allegations that he threatened Mr Herat's father Bruce after an altercation at a Burwood gym, saying he planned to sue the company for $10 million in damages.\nAccording to Nine News Mr Mehajer believed he was set up, saying Mr Herat had ties to a commercial lender who was currently suing the deputy mayor after a business deal went south.\n\"The police are yet to confirm whether these matters are linked,\" he said.\nMehajer also addressed allegations that he was using his position on Auburn council to benefit his property developer business as part of a group of councillors known as the 'super six'.\n\"We never actually always vote together in the so called 'super six'. If you look at the council records there are a number of times I've voted with the poor four if I may call them that,\" referring to the other four Auburn councillors. \nMonday night's interview coincided with the release of a music video by US rapper Bow Wow shot in Mr Mehajer's Auburn mansion. \nMehajer promoted the video on his Facebook page in August, telling his followers to keep a lookout for exciting things to come. \nIn a more recent Facebook post, Mr Mehajer told his 7,800 followers: \"Remember, Nothing is impossible, the word itself says 'I'm possible'\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T13:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T15:53:36.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
