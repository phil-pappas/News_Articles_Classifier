She passes by a wall with some graffiti written in Arabic, but the producers didn’t know what the messages translated to in English. \nOne of them read, \" Homeland is a joke, and it didn’t make us laugh.\" \nThe group responsible, the Arabian Street Artists, who were hired to design the Syrian refugee camp set, said they did it to protest what they believe is the show’s negative portrayal of Muslims. \n\"The series has garnered the reputation of being the most bigoted show on television for its inaccurate, undifferentiated and highly biased depiction of Arabs, Pakistanis, and Afghans, as well as its gross misrepresentations of the cities of Beirut, Islamabad and the so-called Muslim world in general,” the artists wrote on one of their websites . “For four seasons, and entering its fifth, Homeland has maintained the dichotomy of the photogenic, mainly white, mostly American protector versus the evil and backwards Muslim threat.\" \nThe show’s producers seemed calm about the situation. “We wish we’d caught these images before they made it to air,” Alex Gansa, the executive producer of Homeland , wrote in a statement. “However, as Homeland always strives to be subversive in its own right and a stimulus for conversation, we can’t help but admire this act of artistic sabotage.” \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
