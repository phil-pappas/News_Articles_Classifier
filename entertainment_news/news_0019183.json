Mum and baby are doing great. Robert is already enjoying his new role as big brother.\"\nRobert was only thrilled to learn he was going to have sibling in his life with Claudine and Robbie announced the news to him last July.\n Very excited to announce that Claudine is pregnant with our second child.
