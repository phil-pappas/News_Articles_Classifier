The event was infused with music, artists and people with big ideas, and Erica shared with me the dream of opening a vintage store. \nFast-forward to the fall and she is harvesting the fruits of her labor. No longer a dream, Erica is now opening her new vintage clothing store in the Starland District, naming it House of Strut. \nIF YOU GO \nWhat: House of Strut grand opening party \nWhen: 5-10 p.m. Oct. 23 \nWhere: House of Strut, 17 W. 41st St. \nCost: Free \nInfo: www.houseofstrut.com \nCLICK HERE to see more photos and hear from our model musicians. \nErica’s store boasts a 12-year collection of vintage garments partnered with new, edgy and modern basics. The opening night “reveal” party Oct. 23 will feature Dope Sandwich artist Lady Valore as emcee, DJ Blade from Dollhouse Productions spinning through the decades, go-go dancers and more. \nAs we sat down to chat, I suggested that instead of a Q&A, we provide visual imagery for a taste of what she has in store. Instead of fashion models, we chose to incorporate a sample of Savannah’s female musicians to be our models. Filled with excitement, Erica added: “Our backdrop should be the Starland District .” \nShe has many reasons to choose the up-and-coming arts district as the homebase of her new venture. \n“We all have known that Starland has had potential for years, but once I couldn’t afford Broughton Street, I decided to support an emerging Savannah downtown neighborhood that was funky and diverse for a creative professional crowd. Starland is the only place I know,” she said. \n“I love the vibe here, the creativity and ethnic races merged in this neighborhood with a great sense of street style. It’s perfect!” \nMusic and fashion go hand in hand, and I believe each one needs and feeds the other. Starland has been at the center of many local preservation movements and the revitalization is finally becoming a reality. With this in mind, we gathered a dozen of our most talented female musicians from all genres: Bluegrass, heavy metal, punk and even jazz are represented. \nAlong with Samson Smith creating hair and makeup, the models were all styled by Erica and pampered like the stars they really are. Big thanks to the entire Starland community for letting us take over their spaces, including Back in the Day Bakery and Starlandia Supply . \nIt must be said, I felt lucky to have the opportunity to work with so many of these women. Like bees buzzing, we watched and heard ideas be bounced around the room — including future collaborations. It is the creation of this patchwork-like fabric that makes our community so rich in resources and new ideas. \nWalk the talk seems to be the motto of many women today, and Erica is no different. \nShe adds that the biggest challenge for female business owners today is forming a network of support for each other. \n“I want to approach this business — and life, for that matter — by supporting other women, lifting each other up, collectively help one another reach their goals along the way.” \nErica’s hopes and wishes for House of Strut are clear. \n“Through creating this business, I have met the most amazing women who are hustling and realizing their own dreams. My hope is that I can inspire them to make positive changes in their life by chasing after their goals and looking good doing it! \n“House of Strut will be an experience where fashion, music and arts will collide,” she said. “A place to journey through fashion history, expanding their wardrobe while listening to great music of the past while pondering art. I will be hands-on, styling clients along the way, helping them layer looks and hopefully understanding more of who they are on the inside, so the outside will reflect just that.” \nOrganically, a simple story in a newspaper became the documentation of powerful, talented and strong women. \nLike a time capsule, we have captured a space and time in Savannah. \nAfter capturing the essence and energy of Starland, I encourage you to visit and support this thriving area of our small city. \nWhile you’re at it ... you have permission to strut along its sidewalks. \n\nAdriana Iris Boatwright is a photographer and lifestyle blogger residing in Savannah.
