The City & Colour frontman (and occasional Alexisonfire member) opens his fifth full-length by throwing down something of a gauntlet: The song Woman, a slow-burning, slow-building, nine-minute declaration of undying love voiced in his vulnerable falsetto. It is the longest number he’s ever recorded. It’s also one of the most beautiful and sincere (which is really saying something). More pressingly, it perfectly sets the tone, mood and approach for the rest of the disc. Green’s bluesiest and most soulful outing, If I Should Go Before You features a consistently strong slate of gorgeous ruminations on love and death and friends and heartache — most of which eschew his usual impeccable songcraft and arrangements for simplicity and immediacy, seeming to flow straight from his heart onto the tape. The pacing is deliberate and unhurried, the band’s work understated and natural, the production rich and suffused in gentle twang and unobtrusive reverb. It might sound a little bit like Antony Hegarty joining forces with Dan Auerbach, and it definitely sounds a whole lot better than most of the new pop troubadudes currently clogging the airwaves. Moody, magnificent and damn close to a masterpiece, this might be the finest album of Green’s career. At least so far. And it might be the disc that finally brings him the widespread acclaim and success he has long deserved. \nMusic Complete \n4 stars out of 5 \nBetter make that Renewed. The British vets’ 10th album also marks the departure of founding-turned-feuding bassist Peter Hook, the return of keyboardist/guitarist Gillian Gilbert and the debut of new bassist Tom Chapman. They aren’t the only personnel changes; these 11 cuts also feature a roster of guest vocalists (including LaRoux’s Elly Jackson, The Killers’ Brandon Flowers and punk elder statesman Iggy Pop) and producers (like Chemical Brother Tom Rowlands and electronic pop king Stuart Price). All the changeups have clearly done them good; New Order sounds fresher and freer than they have in eons. Returning to a more electronic base, they nimbly and energetically fuse sleek grooves and engaging melodies to create richly textured tracks that honour their legacy without dwelling in the past. Made to order. \nEagles of Death Metal \nZipper Down \n3.5 stars out of 5 \nBoots Electric and Baby Duck finally got the seven-year itch. Yep, it’s been that long since Jesse Hughes and Josh Homme made an EODM album. But don’t expect them to make up for lost time here. Or clean up their act. Short, sharp and typically nasty, Zipper Down picks up right where 2008’s Heart On left off, with a sizzling set of sleazy garage, glam and retro-rock come-ons that slag hipsters, dance with the deuce and praise women who like to shake it. There’s even an inspired cover of Duran Duran’s Save a Prayer. The downside: Three of the songs are remakes of cuts from Hughes’ 2011 solo disc Honkey Kong. Seems like somebody needs to pull up his socks along with his zipper. \nBOX SETS \nFive Years: 1969-1973 \n5 stars out of 5 \nYou can get a lot done in five years. Especially when you’re David Bowie. And the years in question are 1969 to 1973. By the time they rolled around, the former David Jones had already weathered one failed bid for pop stardom — and after studying dance and mime, honing his songwriting skills and reinventing himself for the first of countless times, he was ready to conquer the world. Which is pretty much what he did with his 1969 single Space Oddity, kicking off the first half-decade for one of rock’s most chameleonic and influential forces. No wonder this new box revisits and reproduces that flawless era in exhaustive detail. The 12-disc set naturally includes all Bowie’s studio albums from the period — David Bowie a.k.a. Space Oddity, The Man Who Sold the World, Hunky Dory, The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (in both the original version and the beefier 2003 mix), Aladdin Sane and Pin Ups (you could argue they should have tossed in 1974’s Diamond Dogs, his final glam album before going soul with Young Americans, but then they would have had to call it Six Years, wouldn’t they?). It also includes two subsequently released live albums documenting those days — 1983’s Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars: The Motion Picture Soundtrack (which captured Bowie’s final Ziggy gig) and 2008’s Live Santa Monica ’72, the official release of a much-bootlegged FM radio broadcast. Finally, there’s a two-disc Re:Call compilation of assorted rarities, outtakes and B-sides, including a previously unreleased mono single edit of All the Madmen. The same completist approach and attention to detail are exhibited in the packaging: All the albums come in faithful reproductions of the original cardboard jackets, complete with gatefolds, inner sleeves and inserts (the only alteration: The orange RCA label type has been changed to read Bowie). And while there’s no DVD, unfortunately, there is a magnificent 128-page hard-cover book with album-by-album notes, recording notes from producers Tony Visconti and Ken Scott, vintage album reviews and a bazillion pictures, including original artwork, lyrics sheets, advertisements and sleeve art for all the singles. In short: It’s a total blam-blam. \nThe Faces \nYou Can Make Me Dance, Sing or Anything: 1970-1075 \n4 stars out of 5 \nWhen it comes to The Faces, you can indeed make fans do almost anything: Like buy the same songs over again. More than a decade after the superb four-disc anthology Five Guys Walk into a Bar…, Rhino ups the ante (sort of) with this five-disc box. Unlike Five Guys, it includes complete versions of the eternally soused British rockers’ four studio albums — The First Step (1970), Long Player (1971), A Nod Is as Good as a Wink…to a Blind Horse (1971), and Ooh La La (1973) — along with plenty of bonus tracks and a fifth disc of stray singles and B-sides. Naturally, there’s a lot of overlap with Five Guys — but unfortunately, each set has a bunch of unreleased gems the other one doesn’t. So if you just have to have that live version of Too Much Woman (For A Henpecked Man) from the Fillmore East in 1970, start dancing, pal. \nThe Grateful Dead \n30 Trips Around the Sun: The Definitive Live Story 1965–1995 \n4.5 stars out of 5 \nThe ultimate box set of 2015 might be The Grateful Dead’s upcoming 30 Trips Around the Sun: An 80-disc set with 30 complete, previously unreleased shows — one per year from 1966 through 1995 — that lasts 73 hours and costs $700. For those who aren’t quite willing to make that kind of commitment, however, there is the four-disc Definitive Live Story version. It cherrypicks 30 songs from the Trips shows, along with a bonus 1965 studio rendition of Caution (Do Not Stop on Tracks). Not surprisingly, there are plenty of treats in the comparatively lean 277-minute running time: A hard-driving version of Cream Puff War, a dreamy Dark Star, an epic Shakedown Street, outstanding versions of Uncle John’s Band, Estimated Prophet, Deep Elem Blues and Ramble On Rose, covers of Dancing in the Street, Not Fade Away and Dylan’s Visions of Johanna, and plenty of deep album cuts instead of the usual hits. It’s a must. But be careful: It’s only going to tempt you to shell out for the full meal deal. \nNOW HEAR THIS \nMeow the Jewels \n3 stars out of 5 \nNo kitten. What began as a Kickstarter gag has become a wonderfully weird alternate reality: Killer Mike and El-P — aided by cool-cat producers like Geoff Barrow, Prince Paul and Dan the Automator — have remixed their 2014 album into a cat-centric creation with sampled purrs, meows and howls repurposed into percussion, melodies and vocals. Sure, it’s more novelty than necessity. But you know you want to hear it anyway. And all the profits go to charity. So that’s nothing to hiss at. \nBig Grams \nBig Grams \n2.5 stars out of 5 \nThat’s Big as in Boi and Grams as in Phanto. After joining forces for a few songs a few years ago, the OutKast alumni and the New York electro-rockers reteam for this EP. Predictably, it’s a not-so-seamless cross between the Big Apple hipsters’ sophisticatedly chilly synth-siren songs and the Atlanta rapper’s random rude rhymes. Interesting, if not a match made in hip-hop heaven. \nFetty Wap \nFetty Wap \n3.5 stars out of 5 \nBeginner’s luck doesn’t cut it. Barely two years into his career, New Jersey’s Willie Maxwell is hip-hop’s newly crowned prince, with three singles — including calling card Trap Queen — in the charts. And thanks to the warm warble, innate sense of melody, endearingly unpolished delivery and everyman persona he displays on this long but likeable debut, they likely won’t be his last. \nRobin Schulz \nSugar \n3 stars out of 5 \nSprechen sie deep house? Robin Schulz surely does. The German DJ and producer brings all the four-on-the-floor beats and lush synths you expect to his sophomore album — along with the usual slate of vocalists including Canadian soul-pop wunderkind Francesco Yates. Other good news: His sunny melodies and upbeat vibe add some tropical touches to the playlist. Sweet. \nThe Dears \nTimes Infinity Vol. 1 \n4 stars out of 5 \nOnce is not enough for The Dears. True to its title, the Montrealers’ sixth set (and first album in four years) is the first of two parts. As usual, it finds frontman Murray Lightburn obsessed with romance and its aftermath — while his newly downsized band soundtracks his infatuation with swoonworthy arrangements and seductively orchestrated indie-rock. Infinitely satisfying. \nBorn Ruffians \nRuff \n3.5 stars out of 5 \nFamiliarity doesn’t have to breed contempt. Not with Born Ruffians. Sure, the choppy indie-rock, oddball pop and wiry post-punk of the Torontonians’ fourth disc — not to mention Luke Lalonde’s high-angle yelp — will remind you of everyone from Violent Femmes to Vampire Weekend to Superchunk. But it’s all so catchy and infused with their own arch wit that you can’t help but love it. \nReflektor: Deluxe Edition \n3.5 stars out of 5 \nPatience may be its own reward. But if you’re tired of waiting for Arcade Fire to follow up their 2013 stunner Reflektor, feed your jones for new songs with the six bonus cuts on this deluxe edition. In keeping with the original’s Sandinista vibe, it’s a mixed bag of everything from mutant blues to reggae and dub (with Linton Kwesi Johnson) and atmospheric ballads. On reflection, not too bad. \nCorb Lund \nThings That Can’t be Undone \n3.5 stars out of 5 \nTrail blazer or path follower? Canadian country maverick Corb Lund is both on his ninth album. So those who love the hurtin’ Albertan’s honky-tonk twang and poignant narratives will find plenty to bring them back. But fan who prefer his more adventurous moments will appreciate the forays into ’60s-style Motown soul, British Invasion pop, folk and garage-rock. Either way, you win. \nDeafheaven \nNew Bermuda \n4 stars out of 5 \nGreatness made greater. Heaviness made heavier. For this followup to 2013’s acclaimed Sunbather, these San Francisco black metallists raise the stakes by raising the bar in nearly every conceivable way (along with a few inconceivable ones). Their songs are longer (up to 10 minutes) and more intricate; the performances are fiercer and more relentlessly intense; the primal-scream vocals are more bloodthirsty and punishing (but no less indecipherable); and the shoegaze and post-rock oases are more elegant and poignant. Ambitious and transcendent. \nWavves \nV \n3.5 stars out of 5 \nYou think you need to get your head together? Just listen to Nathan Williams. The Wavves frontman spends his fifth album plagued by failings, foibles and fears — many involving headaches, losing his mind and brain damage. Good thing he sets his complaints to noisy surf-punk nuggets so infectiously rambunctious they make up for his self-doubt. His problems are all in his head. \nThe World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die \nHarmlessness \n4 stars out of 5 \nEmo is not a dirty word. Not the way this massive (and massively overnamed) Connecticut collective plays it, anyway. Mostly because they’re less about the cathartic angst and furious guitars and more about superbly written songs with poppy touches and high-angle vocals reminiscent of everyone from Sunny Day Real Estate to Superchunk and Weakerthans. Close to flawlessness. \nYouth Lagoon \nSavage Hills Ballroom \n3.5 stars out of 5 \nFrom the bedroom to the ballroom. With a side trip to the bughouse. For his third long-player, Boise oddball Trevor Powers evolves beyond his idiosyncratic beginnings into a more commercially accessible indie-popster — while retaining the vocal peculiarities, lyrical obsessions and sonic eccentricities that make his sweetly experimental tunes compelling and unique. Strange but true. \nLe Butcherettes \nA Raw Youth \n4 stars out of 5 \nTeri Gender Bender may be growing up. But she isn’t growing soft. True, the Mexican provocateur turns in her most disciplined and focused work on her misleadingly titled third disc, nudging her muscularly intense garage-punk toward the mainstream with sharper hooks and bigger choruses. Input from Iggy Pop, John Frusciante and longtime producer Omar Rodríguez-López don’t hurt either. But fear not; Teri’s feral unpredictability and uncompromising individuality are far from tamed. She may be getting ready for her closeup, but not on anyone’s terms but her own. \nSteep Canyon Rangers \nRadio \n3.5 stars out of 5 \nNo joke. Unlike their fun-loving outings with pal Steve Martin, the North Carolina bluegrass sextet play it straight on their ninth release. But as usual, they play (and sing) it impeccably — and with enough contemporary flair and flavour to avoid sounding like a throwback. That might not land their blend of mountain music, folk and country on the air, but it should put it on your playlist. \nAlabama \nSouthern Drawl \n3 stars out of 5 \nChurch is out. After releasing three discs of spirituals, hymns and gospel fare over the past decade, the veteran country trio get back to their roots on their 23rd studio album (and first disc of original fare in 15 years). And if you’re looking for a mix of southern hillbilly rock, upbeat country-pop, patriotic anthems and romantic ballads, they’re speaking your language. Enjoy, y’all. \nBottle Rockets \nSouth Broadway Athletic Club \n3.5 stars out of 5 \nSix years is a long time between workouts. But singer-guitarist Brian Henneman and his St. Louis crew are in fine form on their first studio disc since 2009. Shifting between roots-rock, jangle-pop, alt-country and more, they hate Mondays, love their dogs, build Chryslers and enjoy life’s simple pleasures — while reminding you of everyone from Dave Edmunds to NRBQ.
