The room has not been updated since the 1960s or earlier. It's about time to give it a facelift.\nDesign by Steinhafels Furniture • Budget: $10,000+\nChanging the direction of the focal point will open up the room and allow for more seating. Moving the TV above the fireplace moves the focal point to the architectural element of the room. Keep the red as an inspirational color by adding an area rug to pull in color and style to the flooring. Keeping the furniture in neutral colors will allow you to easily change the accent color if you would like. Mixing leather with fabric creates interest. All pieces in this room seem to have the same color palette; however, keep the patterns to a minimum on larger pieces and bring pattern in through area rugs, pillows and accessories.\nSuggestion: • A leather chair will create interest but keep the base colors neutral.\n• Use a sectional and reduce the amount of separate seating to open up the space and allow for more seating. When the focal point is changed the space will open up.\n• Add an area rug to create an anchor for the furniture.\n Life & Entertainment Des Plaines Room for Living Decor", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-25T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:15:51.168+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
