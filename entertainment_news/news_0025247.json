Stage 5 of the Amgen Tour of California, the individual time trials, was just a day away from rolling through Big Bear Lake in 2015.\nA freakish May snowstorm drove the event away.\nOfficials were forced to move the Big Bear Lake leg to snow-free Valencia and Santa Clarita. It would have been the third time Big Bear Lake hosted a stage of the race. The other two times came in 2010 and 2012, when it was the site of the finish of stages that started in Palmdale.\nA Big Bear stop is not included on the 2016 Amgen tour, details of which were released this week.\nBut AEG, the tour's producer, is flirting with a return to Big Bear, perhaps as soon as 2017, according to a statement released this week.\n\"Big Bear Lake is a very important partner for the Amgen Tour of California,\" Kristin Klein, Amgen Tour of California president and AEG Sports executive vice president, said in the release. \"We have enjoyed an outstanding relationship with the city, as we have hosted three stages in the event's 10-year history. The community support, spectacular scenery and spectator interest make Big Bear Lake an ideal location.\"\n\"Big Bear Lake has become the Cycling Capital of Southern California,\" said Craig Smith, Big Bear Cycling president and a regional Angen committee chief. \"We remain very excited about professional and recreational road cycling in our community and the hopeful return of a 2017 Amgen Tour of California stage.\"\nDoes the release chatter translate into \"wait 'til next year?\" Stay tuned.\nInland Southern California’s popular mountain playground is about to enter its rock-star winter season when the skiers rock and snowboarders roll. But Big Bear’s less glamorous sister is getting a closer look these days, too.\nAnd it may not be long before summer rivals winter.\nPam Scannell, Big Bear Chamber of Commerce executive director, said the picturesque town in the beloved San Bernardino Mountains draws 6 million visitors a year. And while a precise breakdown isn’t available, she said, about 55 percent visit in winter compared to 45 percent.\nThat’s a big change from the 2-to-1 dominance winter enjoyed 20 years ago, when the chamber launched a visitor bureau to plug Big Bear as a place to visit all year and not just as a haven for winter sports.\n“We’ve been working all this time to bring a better balance,” Scannell said in an interview recently. “There were shops that would just close down for the summer because there was no business. They don’t do that now. I can guarantee you that.”\nIt’s not hard to see why.\n‘A BORING PERSON’\nPeople flock to Big Bear during the warm and mostly dry months to take breathtaking zip line rides, shoot down an alpine slide, get their hearts pumping on a high-altitude hike, test their rock climbing skills on a boulder or try out a water sport called flyboarding that looks like something out of an action movie scene.\nThe latter, Scannell said, is a “James Bond type thing” where participants take to flight above the area’s namesake lake on a double blast of water from the board attached to their feet.\nThen there’s the soaring popularity of mountain biking. It’s anchored by an extensive trail system in the nearby national forest and at Snow Summit, which is scheduled to close out its summer season Sunday.\nThere’s more than one way to measure the meteoric rise of the rugged, adventurous form of cycling. Scannell cited a barometer you might not naturally think of: “The hospital has seen a huge increase in mountain bike injuries.”\nSnow Summit measures it in the number of tickets sold for mountain bikers seeking a chairlift ride for themselves and their bikes. Wade Reeser, vice president of operations for Big Bear Mountain Resorts, which operates Snow Summit and Bear Mountain under the corporate umbrella of Mammoth Mountain, said 26,000 such tickets were sold in summer 2014.\nCoupled with 29,000 general tickets, Reeser said 55,000 visitors took advantage of the Snow Summit Sky Chair.\nThen, of course, there are traditional activities such as camping, fishing, boating, swimming and water skiing. The Pacific Crest Trail that meanders 2,650 miles from Mexico to Canada swings through just outside of town.\nSo don’t gripe to Scannell that there’s nothing to do. You may not get a sympathetic ear.\n1 2 3 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwov1g-b88539861z.120151023124615000gqickpvn.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwov1d-b88539861z.120151023124615000gqickq00.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwov1f-b88539861z.120151023124615000gqickpvf.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwov1f-b88539861z.120151023124615000gqickpvl.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwov1h-b88539861z.120151023124615000gqickpuk.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwov1g-b88539861z.120151023124615000gqickpvn.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwov1e-b88539861z.120151023124615000gqickpvj.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwov1h-b88539861z.120151023124615000gqickpuk.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwov1e-b88539861z.120151023124615000gqickpvd.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwov1g-b88539861z.120151023124615000gqickpug.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwov1g-b88539861z.120151023124615000gqickpui.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwov1f-b88539861z.120151023124615000gqickpvf.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwov1e-b88539861z.120151023124615000gqickpvj.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwov1f-b88539861z.120151023124615000gqickpvl.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwov1e-b88539861z.120151023124615000gqickpvd.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwov1g-b88539861z.120151023124615000gqickpui.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwov1d-b88539861z.120151023124615000gqickq00.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwov1g-b88539861z.120151023124615000gqickpug.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:10:32.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
