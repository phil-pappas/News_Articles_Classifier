Not that the Memphis-South Florida contest (1.155 million viewers; No. 17 on Friday's cable hit list) was a marquee matchup, but it kicked off at 7 p.m. ET. BYU game coverage didn't begin until 10:18 p.m. ET and ended after 1 a.m., when there are far fewer available viewers.\n And the score — 7-7 at the half; 10-10 after three quarters — didn't exactly encourage viewers to stick around long enough to see that BYU ended up winning 30-13.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T11:09:40.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
