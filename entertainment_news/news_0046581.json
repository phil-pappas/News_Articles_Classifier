Just on its own limited terms, “Pan,” supposedly the story of how Peter got his start, is a complete washout, a joyless, pointless and fundamentally idiotic enterprise.\nIf that sounds harsh, consider this scene: A flying pirate ship snatches Peter and some other boys from their beds in a London orphanage in order to force them into slave labor. But guess what? It’s World War II, and the Nazis are dropping bombs on London that very night.\nMore Information Pan\n★\nQuick take: Stupid and ugly\nOf course, being Nazis, they start firing at the pirate ship. So we have a long action sequence in which German war planes are shooting at a flying boat as it tries to make its way into outer space.\nThere’s a lot of stupid here to unpack, so let’s take things one at a time. A flying pirate ship is no problem. It’s a movie, and they can fly anything they want. But why set the film during World War II?\nThere’s no reason for it, except for the sake of having that action sequence, which is weird for another reason: Pirates are bad. Pirate kidnappers are even worse. But Nazis are also bad. So if Nazis are firing missiles at the people who have just kidnapped the future Peter Pan, and yet Peter is onboard. How are we supposed to feel about that?\nWe don’t know, and so John Powell ’s score is there to tell us. We are supposed to feel peril, but not worry about it. We are supposed to feel triumph, but be in slight doubt. We are supposed to see this scene as just one part of the wonderful and thrilling spectacle of Peter’s ongoing existence. Alas, it’s never fun to sit in an audience and feel that the soundtrack is lying to you.\nBut wait, it gets worse. It turns out that Peter is just one of thousands of orphaned boys who have been kidnapped to work in a mine. Blackbeard (an almost unrecognizable Hugh Jackman ) has enslaved them because he is in search of crystallized fairy dust. He needs the fairy dust because he is at war with the neighboring fairy kingdom.\nThis is how evil Blackbeard is. He wants to kill all the fairies. And somehow the fairy dust is supposed to help, though how is never explained.\nWhen we first meet Blackbeard, he is striding out to the worshipful masses, who greet him by singing “Smells Like Teen Spirit” in unison. The song has nothing to do with the context or the situation. It’s a bastardization of the song’s meaning, and it’s there only to get a chuckle from adult viewers who’ve had the misfortune to bring their kids to this mess. Later, the same crowd greets Blackbeard with a rendition of the Ramones’ “Blitzkrieg Bop.”\nI suppose if the filmmakers have no respect for “Peter Pan” author J.M. Barrie , you can’t expect them to have any regard for Nirvana or the Ramones.\nWhat an ugly movie, both in look and spirit. Peter’s orphanage is Dickensian, run by evil nuns with rotten teeth. (If you ever see a nice nun in a movie, the apocalypse is near.) At one point, Blackbeard invades the fairy kingdom and, using a flamethrower, starts blowtorching fairies!\nAre the filmmakers kidding us? This is family entertainment? This is enchantment? I guess we’re all supposed to walk out of the theater thinking, “Gee, ain’t it great that most of the fairies didn’t get blowtorched.” I walked out disturbed to find out that fairies could be blowtorched in the first place. If I saw this movie at 6 years old, I’d be wondering if the Tooth Fairy had fire insurance.\nAgainst this background, it’s perhaps inevitable that Levi Miller plays Peter as an unpleasant and sometimes nasty little kid. However, it doesn’t explain why Garrett Hedlund plays Hook (in his pre-Captain days) as a Harrison Ford wannabe, mugging and bug-eyed. Talk about a director ( Joe Wright ) leaving an actor hanging out to dry.\nOnly Rooney Mara as Princess Tiger Lily emerges undiminished, because she gets to play someone nice.\nMore nice. Less fairy death. Fewer Nazis, rotting teeth and anachronistic music references. And less bad things happening to Peter’s Mommy. There’s a formula here to be studied for future movies. Just take whatever they did in “Pan” and do something else.\nRunning time: 111 minutes\nMPAA rating: PG (action violence)", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/23/8721645/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/23/8721645/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/65/8756586/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/65/8756587/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/65/8756588/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/65/8756585/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/65/8756588/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/65/8756585/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/65/8756586/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/65/8756587/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T14:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:33:47.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
