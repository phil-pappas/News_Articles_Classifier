Stopping by the show to promote her new book \"Adios America!: The Left's Plan to Turn Our Country Into a Third-World Hellhole\", the right-wing pundit was grilled for being pro- Donald Trump and supporting his anti-immigrant statements. The eleven-time best-selling author said of a possible Trump nomination, \"It'll be fantastic.\" She went on praising the businessman, \"And I think he's exposing really both parties and how much control the donors have. He's saying things that people have been dying for someone to say but they won't because their donors, in the case of immigration, want the cheap labor.\" Coulter thought immigrants were used to serve the rich and insisted that America was not founded by immigrants. She claimed she was \"descended from settlers\" not immigrants. When co-host Raven-Symone interrupted her to say, \"My mom taught me when I was younger, if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it at all...Why do you think it's important to mudsling?\" Coulter responded by bringing up Raven-Symone's recent controversial comments about ghetto name. \"Well, I'm at least talking about policy,\" Coulter fired back. \"You have a position on what people's names should be. Watermelondrea... I mean, you'll insult people for their names. I'm talking about a government policy that affects all Americans, and immigrants, and the people living here.\" Padma Lakshmi who joined the panel that morning also disagreed with Coulter, pointing out that her mother immigrated to the U.S. in the 1970s to work as a nurse. \"Whenever people talk about the immigrants we like, like your mother, they cite the immigrants that aren't the majority of immigrants coming in,\" Coulter responded. \"So fine, OK, if they're going to be doctors. But we have a majority of immigrants on welfare.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:19:26.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
