JENNIFER KOPF | Staff Writer \nTanger Arboretum's new conifer garden parallels President Avenue, spanning the space between the street and LancasterHistory.org. \nUnder the massive cedar of Lebanon tree towering over the east end of Tanger Arboretum , the scattering of tiny conifers might be missed by drivers cruising by on President Avenue — but they shouldn’t be overlooked. \nThey’ll never top out over 100 feet, like a cedar of Lebanon can. But these dwarf conifers form the backbone of a new garden at the Lancaster arboretum that features conifers best viewed up close and personal. \nTanger’s newest project opens with a Friday night gala event and also will be open to the public as part of the site’s renewed outreach efforts. The garden \nTucked into undulating, landscaped slopes, the Dwarf Conifer Garden is part of a comprehensive plan that will affect the whole 10-acre LancasterHistory.org campus that encompasses Lancaster County’s historical society as well as President James Buchanan’s Wheatland . \nThe goal, says Jeff Hazlett, of Tanger’s board of directors, is to tie the historical aspect of the property to the modern day. The hope, he says, is that as word gets out about the arboretum’s expansion, more of the public will use it as a resource. \n“Most Lancaster residents are not familiar with the Tanger Arboretum,” board member Kelly Seidle said in an email. “The debut (of the Dwarf Conifer Garden) is perfect to generate interest in unusual species that can be incorporated into everyone’s garden.” \nThe planting, funded largely through grants, still is in progress. Nearly 60, or roughly half of the dwarf conifers, already are in the ground; the remainder are slated for planting come spring. \nStone slab stairways and gravel paths meander through the mulched planting beds, giving visitors an intimate view of the specimens’ shapes, textures and colors. In several cases, a dwarf version of one of the arboretum’s standard-size conifers will allow visitors to compare the two. \nTemporary labels now adorn each plant, but permanent ones will be added to match the others scattered around Tanger. \nThe effort, spearheaded by Seidle, has earned the arboretum Level I accreditation by ArbNet, an international community of arborita , board member Howard T. Kauffman noted. Dwarf conifers \nThe dwarf designation, board member Bob Davis says, has as much to do with a conifer’s growth rate as it does with its final size. (And he should know: Davis’ conservative estimate of the different dwarf conifer species he has growing at his home stands at about 450.) \nGrowth of fewer than 2 inches a year classifies conifers as miniature, Davis says. Dwarf conifers grow 6 inches or fewer a year; anything that grows more than 6 inches annually is considered standard size. \nSpecimens for the new garden were chosen because they’ll do well in the local planting zone. They also were selected to exhibit a range of textures, spreading habits, heights and colors of dwarf conifers — from deep green to a gray-blue to a yellowish hue. \nOne resembles a low-lying mound of moss; another, with its profile of weeping branches, looks like Cousin It. \nDifferent depths have been created by using different planting techniques. Some are planted directly into the ground, while others are grafted onto a “standard,” which forms a trunklike elevation for the conifer. \n“A lot of homes would benefit from dwarf and miniature conifers,” Davis says. “They take up less space,” and a homeowner knows that, once it’s planted and established, the plant won’t take over or outgrow its spot. \nAnd a homeowner isn’t going to have to worry about major maintenance tasks, such as trimming. If you go \nTanger Arboretum, on the grounds of LancasterHistory.org, 230 N. President Ave., is open year-round. Admission is free.
