He defends his title at the event this weekend.\nBack | Next Courtesy Bacon Park Golf Course\nThe trophy for the winner of the annual Savannah City Amateur golf tournament, which is Saturday and Sunday at Bacon Park Golf Course.\nBy Elmo Weeks\nA new chapter in the history of the Savannah City Amateur will begin Saturday on an old course made new again.\nThe City Am will be played this weekend for the first time on the fully restored Donald Ross Course at Bacon Park Golf Course. During the past two years, the course has been redesigned under the management of OC Welch Golf Properties according to the original designs sketched by legendary golf architect Donald Ross.\nThe first nine holes were completed in 2014 and the City Am was contested on the restored first nine and the unrestored second nine. The second nine holes were completed earlier this fall but open for the first time today to allow registered City Am participants to play practice rounds.\nThe fully restored Ross Course will be open to the public for the first time on Sunday beginning at 3 p.m.\nAs of Thursday, there were nearly 100 players registered to play in the City Am, including defending champion John Skeadas II, and former champions Danny Nelson and Peter Brennan. The tournament’s honorary starter on Saturday will be Mike Stroud, who played his first City Am in 1969 and will strike the first shot at 7:45 a.m. on the first tee in honor of the late Marion “Big Daddy” Lowe, a legendary figure at Bacon Park who organized the Lowe Blitze in the mid-1970s for the area’s best players.\n“From what I’ve seen, (OC Welch Golf Properties) has done a magnificent job of recreating the Ross Course,” said Skeadas, whose won this third City Am title in 2014. “The restoration of the original layout will make the golf course more difficult, and the second nine will now be as tough as the first nine. I think it’s reasonable to say that this year is the most important City Am in the past 35 years, and now that the golf course is finished, (the tournament) is going to gain momentum and be even better in future years.”\nThe second nine features some of the most difficult holes on the course, including Nos. 12, 13, 15 and 17. The 15th hole, a 418-yard par-4, and the 17th hole, a 233-yard par-3, are expected to be the most difficult holes on the reconfigured course.\n“This is the first time the golf course will be like it’s supposed to be, and that’s a big deal,” said OC Welch Golf Properties president OC Welch, whose experiences working and playing golf at Bacon Park fueled his passion to restore the original Donald Ross layout. “We’ve gone above and beyond on the second nine, and (the City Am) is going to get to where it was supposed to be as a prestigious tournament instead of just another event on the calendar. We’ve done everything we wanted to do, and we’ve knocked it out of the park on this project, for sure.”\nAlthough the course has not been opened for play, several players have toured the second nine during the past week in preparation for the tournament. The course’s total yardage will measure only 6,300 yards, but elevation changes, doglegs and speedy greens should protect against low scores.\n“I can’t say if the course will be harder or easier, but we’ll all be in the same boat,” said Nelson, who was won multiple City Am titles since moving to Savannah in 1985. “The better conditions will certainly make it easier than it has been in the past, but there are a lot of nuances out there we haven’t seen before. I just think it’s a wonderful 18 holes of golf, and I think the (City of Savannah) should send a thank you card to OC Welch.”\nSavannah City Amateur\nat Bacon Park Golf Course\nFirst-round pairings Saturday\n8 a.m. — Matt Stroud, Will Gallagher, Walter Hagan\n8:10 — Kyle Kent, Matt Nixon, Trey Kent\n8:20 — Joey Dewitt, Davy Clay, Carl Ward\n8:30 — Jeff Cowart, Jay Rowe, Joe Frederick\n8:40 — Chris White, Barry Brennan, Kyle Pratt\n8:50 — Stuart Edwards, Philip Houg, Henry Wyndham\n9:10 — Rafael Array, Jeff O’Connor, Bob Remler\n9:20 — Stephen McInerney, Kevin Sethpun, William Rossing\n9:30 — Will Sharpe, Les McDaniel II, Reed Oyler\n9:40 — Parker Stone, Nate Tosto, James Wohler\n9:50 — Christian Parker, Will Grotto, Philip Kennedy\n10 — John Skeadas II, John Skeadas III, Danny Nelson\n10:10 — Peter Brennan, Ben Brennan, Shawn Elmore\n10:20 — Andy Becker, Michael Gonzalez, Mario Williams\n10:30 — Darrell Gaffney, Hamish Huntly, Trent Williams\n10:50 — Josh Courter, Jason Anderson\n11 — Hunter Furr, Ryan Maines, Eric Williams\n11:10 — Justin Roberts, Marc Friedenbach, Josh Dundon\n11:20 — Keith Thomas, David Allgire, Owen McConnon\n11:30 — Mark Berry, Pat Winters\n11:40 — Howard Bacon, Mike Forehand, Scott Pearce\n11:50 — Bill McClosky, Les McDaniel, Randy Dees\nNoon — Edward Alsteadt, David Davis, Charlie Clarke\n12:10 p.m. — Mike Morris, Steve Cummins, Mike Sills\n12:20 — Donald Consos, Dick Matthews, Mike Ferreira\n12:30 — Jerry Kappa, Mike Peters, Ken Hughes\n12:40 — David Fogle, Roger Benton\n12:50 — David Schaller, Bill Massey\n1 — Denver Combs, Howard Tomlinson, Chris Uhl\n1:10 — Don Lieb, Mike Towson, Tom Rood", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14831224.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14831224.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14831192.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14831192.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-22T14:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:17:50.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
