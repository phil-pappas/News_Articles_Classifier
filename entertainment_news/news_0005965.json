From proms to weddings to baby showers, once that DJ starts to spin, there's something about that cavernous echo that begs to be filled with sing-along dance tunes. Top 40 hits come and go, and no doubt there will be plenty of those contemporary tunes throughout the evening, but there are few songs that are as fun now as they were the first time. Not only do they never go out of style, they are essential components of the perfect hoe-down in all banquet halls. \n1. The Chicken Dance This song is a great opener to get the crowd going. Even the stiffest old timers can't help but get up and shake a leg when this song comes on. And what could be cuter than a gaggle of little kids all wiggling their tail feathers and squawking like chicks? This is a great song for a country-themed wedding. \n2. Macarena, by Los Dos Rios A major craze when first released in 1995, the Macarena will keep the energy up, up, up. The simple dance moves and catchy tune are an irresistible combination, and the Latin flavor will be a welcome change of beat. \n3. Dancing Queen, by ABBA Light-hearted and bubbly, Dancing Queen is a must-have for any occasion where free spirits are blooming and the night is young. Dancing Queen was written for the royal Swedish wedding in 1976, but its candy-sweet ebullience is as fresh as ever. This song has gone on to be a romantic staple at just about every wedding in the U.S. \n4. My Heart Will Go On, by Celine Dion The words are simple, the feeling is big. Lost love is in the air, and nobody ever said it better than Celine. Play this song later in the night, after a few glasses of wine have everyone misty-eyed and ready to belt out, \"My heart will go on and N!\" with Celine. \n5. Don't Stop Believin, by Journey The ultimate crowd-pleaser, bring the mood up again with Journey's quintessential Americana midnight adventure song. Fists will pump and memories of late-night train rides and midnight diner trysts will flood back. Even though this song came out in 1981, it still plays on the radio often enough that kids who weren't even born then know the words. It's a great goodbye, goodnight, and see you on the road song. \nThese time-honored tunes have been staples of banquet halls for decades because they've got that timeless jive that keeps them fresh. They are sure to bring back old memories and inspire new ones. \nWhen looking for banquet halls in Vineland, NJ, residents turn to Eastlyn Golf Course & The Greenview Inn.
