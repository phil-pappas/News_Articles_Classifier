He has written the lyrics of a romantic song for an upcoming film called 'Zainab' , featuring Jimmy Shergill and Suha Gezen.\nREAD: Kapil Sibal pens item number for Bollywood film\n\"I have sown the seeds, we are ready with the basic concept, along with initial composition, but it still has its journey to complete. I have published two books of English poems and in the last few years I was beginning to think that I should experiment with the mother tongue more and started writing in Hindi and Urdu. Music is a universal language and should help me connect with a larger audience.\"\nAlso, in a first-of-its-kind initiative in the International Year of the Girl Child, the politician has also penned a song set to the music of internationally acclaimed sitarist, Niladri Kumar.Kumar, the founder of the electric sitar, has taken up a 30-day challenge to musically empower 12 girls from a Vasai orphanage. The girls will be performing at a fundraiser concert later this month.\n\"I will be singing this soulful song with the children at the concert. You will understand its true meaning when you hear it. Any kind of creativity is very satisfying. We are creative even in politics,\" he chuckles.\nAt this concert Niladri Kumar will be playing his priceless sitar, which he has been playing since the age of eight, before he puts it up for auction. Sibal will get to make the first price on this 100-year legacy with which Kumar kickstarted his musical journey.\nFor latest Bollywood updates, follow us on Twitter >>> @TOIEntertain\nFor the latest in Bollywood news, like us on Facebook >>> TOIEntertain\nFor more interesting Bollywood news and pictures, follow us on Pinterest>>> timesofindia\nFor latest Bollywood updates, follow us on G+ >>> The Times of India Entertainment\nWatch: Kapil Sibal defends Rahul Gandhi, attacks RSS", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TOIEntertain", "https://www.pinterest.com/timesofindia/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/jcJgQuRuRKM", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107628521107103264647/+TOIEntertainment/posts", "https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T15:31:37.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
