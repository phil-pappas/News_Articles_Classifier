While the end credit tease in \"Ant-Man\" was nice, a brief glance at her super-suit was definitely just that -- a tease. \n\nFor the Record 2:40 p.m.: An earlier version of this post referred to Evangeline Lilly's \"Ant-Man\" character as Janet Van Dyne. Lilly played Hope, the daughter of original Wasp Janet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:54:03.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
