The actor says, “I really felt the love of the Cebuanos. I just enjoyed every single moment of seeing the smiles and hearing the cheers of all our Kapuso. Thank you so much for the support.” \nEven if his flight was delayed, this didn’t stop the Cebuanos to meet Alden in the flesh making the mall show the most attended Kapuso Fans Day in Cebu. “Until now I am still in awe at the number of people who went there to join the show and I believe it is by God’s grace that I made it to Cebu to make all our Kapuso happy.” \nThe other half of the phenomenal AlDub love team visited the Cebuanos to thank them personally for their unwavering support to Eat Bulaga’s “Kalyeserye,” where the actor shares a split-screen romance with Maine “Yaya Dub” Mendoza. \nThe crowd burst with joy when Ricahrds performed special numbers for his fans.
