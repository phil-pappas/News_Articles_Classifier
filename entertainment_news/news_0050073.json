It begins with the early precedents and an overview of the board leaders through the years. Articles by Jose Lacaba on media control and censorship during Martial Law as well as by Bibeth Orteza on former MTRCB chief Armida Siguion-Reyna can also be found in the book. \nIncluded also are the MTRCB modernization projects and updates on the agency’s initiatives as well as voices from the staff, present board members, and current MTRCB Chairman Atty. Eugenio “Toto” Villareal. \nVillareal is proud that “the present board has been consistent with its mandate to promote and protect the Filipino family, especially the youth, women, and other vulnerable sectors of society, to evaluate and intelligently choose media content.” \nAnother highlight of the 30th anniversary celebration is the culmination of the scriptwriting contest sponsored by the Senior Citizen Committee of the MTRCB. A total of 62 entries centered on empowering senior citizens have been submitted and the awarding ceremony for the top three winners will be held during the anniversary party. \nThe top entrywill receive P30,000, while the second and third top entries P 20,000 and P10,000, respectively. The MTRCB may later on help find producers of the winning full-length screenplay as film or as movie for television. \n“The board will continue to create and implement innovative initiatives that will promote a value-oriented media and entertainment culture,” Chair Toto adds. Come Nov. 14, MTRCB will be holding its 3rd Family and Child Summit entitled “Matalinong Panonood para sa Kabataan” at St. Mary’s College of Quezon City in nearby Mother Ignacia Avenue.
