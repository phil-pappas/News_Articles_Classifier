But that, they said, was that - just friends. \nIn 2007, Zupenda's friend Danielle, her coworker at Health Federation of Philadelphia, where Zupenda was an HIV training specialist, said there was a man Zupenda should most definitely meet. The man she described sounded more familiar with every word. \"Are you talking about Randy Shine? I already know him,\" Zupenda said. \"We're friends, but we don't like each other like that.\" Randy worked five years as a behavior specialist in the University of Pennsylvania's Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics and loves public health, but the West Oak Lane native, who is now 45, loves magic and comedy more. He left the Drexel program 18 months in to take Shine Entertainment full time. He has since performed his blend of stand-up comedy and magic at colleges around the country, at both inaugurations of President Obama, and on Penn and Teller's Fool Us show on the CW.\nRandy and Zupenda, who is now 42, kept in touch through Facebook and phone calls, getting together for dinners, festivals, and music when their schedules meshed. \nLate in 2010, Zupenda was talking to a friend about the qualities she sought in a potential mate: a man both smart and funny who knew and appreciated music, plays, museums, and fine dining, a churchgoer who wasn't too churchy. \nZupenda realized she already knew someone with all those traits. A few days later, she called him. \n\"Have you ever thought that we could be more than friends?\" she asked Randy. \nHer question made him nervous. Was she interested in him? Or did she think he was interested in her, and wanted to move him solidly into the friend zone? \nHis move was simple honesty. \"Yes,\" he said. \n\"Me, too,\" she said. \nBoth love movies, but she was surprised when he suggested Jumping the Broom - a chick flick she suspected he chose just to please her. Other wonderful dates followed. By the end of May, they were a committed couple. \nShe admires his passion for his work, his dedication to family, his lack of caring about what others think of his choices. And his laid-back sense of calm, even in crisis, balances her super-organized, detail-oriented, everything's-urgent sensibility, she said. \nZupenda, who finished her doctorate in public health in 2013, is now director and assistant professor in the bachelor's degree program in public health at La Salle University. \nRandy was moved by her compassion and impressed by her ability to have fun in any group. He greatly admires the way she proves to the world that expectations should never be based on the wealth of the neighborhood where one grew up. How does forever sound? \nIn March 2014, Randy visited Zupenda's grandmother Alma in Camden and received her enthusiastic blessing to marry Zupenda. He drove to Zupenda's place in Lindenwold, placed surprises everywhere, and waited for her return from a conference. Then his phone rang. Zupenda was going to be very late. Randy drove back to Philadelphia. \n\"When I got home, there were flowers everywhere, and candy, and my name spelled out with rose petals,\" Zupenda said. \"It was so romantic, and I was taking pictures of it all, but I didn't think too much of it - he had some making up to do for Valentine's Day.\" \nThe next day, after brunch at Jones and a walk around Independence Mall and Washington Square, Zupenda said she must get home to grade papers. \nPanicked, Randy blurted out that he wanted to visit the South Street comic book store, but it wouldn't take long. She was persuaded. \n\"Should we put more money in the meters and walk, or drive our cars to South Street?\" he asked. \nZupenda says Randy exhibits lots of vision, but is frequently indecisive. To help him out, she always asks the same question she asked that night: \"What's the determining factor?\" \nShe was not expecting his answer: \"The determining factor is, will you be my wife?\" \nHe knelt on the sidewalk and took a ring from his pocket. Zupenda cried. She said thank you, then yes. \nShe called her grandma. He called his mom and dad, Barbara and the Rev. Robert P. Shine Sr., pastor of Philadelphia's Berachah Baptist Church. It was so them \nThe couple held both ceremony and reception at the Merion. The ceremony, which featured two violinists, a keyboardist, and a vocalist, was performed by Zupenda's friend Michael, pastor at Move of God Family Ministries. Randy's father led a unity ceremony in which the couple placed one sculpted heart within another, then inserted a peg that locked them together. Grandma Alma relished her role as mother of the bride. \nZupenda wore five-inch heels to boost her 5-foot-1 frame, but also asked the 170 guests to remain seated when she entered. \"I wanted to make sure when I walked down the aisle, Randy could see me,\" she said. That moment was important to him, too, which is why he nixed the idea of pre-ceremony pictures. \"When you see your bride for the first time that day,\" he said, \"it's like Christmas.\" \nDuring the cocktail hour, Randy's magician friends gave strolling performances. \nThe couple's friend Don, who has been married for decades, gave the couple advice in the form of a magical toast. As he spoke of things that test marriages, he broke apart a string. Marriages overcome these challenges and grow stronger through love, he said, then he showed everyone the broken string was whole again. \nThe bride sat on the groom's lap as her sisters from Sigma Gamma Rho, then his brothers from Alpha Phi Alpha, serenaded them. \nZupenda surprised Randy with an elaborate groom's cake showcasing his love of magic, his alma mater, Pennsylvania State University, his fraternity, WWE Wresting, and comic books. \"The expression on his face meant everything,\" she said. \"Weddings sometimes seem like they are all about the bride, and what I said before the cake came out is, it's also about the groom. This was meant to highlight him, to let him know that I love him.\" Awestruck \nShe was calm as ever all morning long. Then Zupenda heard the music that meant go time. \"That's when it hit me: 'You're going to be married in like 15 minutes. Oh my God, this is it! The moment is finally here.' \" \nRandy felt that same way watching Zupenda walk toward him. \"I was starting this new chapter in my life, with someone who I loved. Till death do us part, we would be in this together. Wow.\" Discretionary spending \nA bargain: Randy's magician friends performed as a wedding gift, and Zupenda got her shoes at 20 percent off. \nThe splurge: After touring the Merion, the couple raised their venue budget to book it.
