If we were sitting here ten years ago and you said, 'How many years have you got?' I would have said if we can get to five we have done well.\"We are now at ten and I think that is the fact that they do make a really good show.\" © ITV / Thames/Syco/Fremantle MediaSimon Cowell and The Overs The X Factor judge continued to discuss why he gets defensive of the programme, saying that it's not fair on the producers of the show when people want it to fail purely because of who he is.\"There are some people out there who have almost got an obsession with it failing,\" he shared. \"I have never felt anything like it in my life. \"But it is only a TV talent show. It is only there to entertain people and it is a fun show to watch and it creates stars. But there are people out there going 'it must fail'. I guess maybe that is partly to do with me.\"[I] think more good has come out of it than bad. I don't see it being a bad thing, it has been good for British TV. It spurred Strictly on, they spurred us on. TV on a Saturday night without these two shows on would be pretty bland, I think.\" © ITV / Thames/Syco/FremantleMediaSimon Cowell and Louis Tomlinson Producer Richard Holloway recently said the show should have a break for a while - an idea that former winners Little Mix agreed with.But rest assured, X Factor fans, as Cowell has some words for you to hold on to.\"I wouldn't worry about the future of X Factor,\" he said. \"We are going to be fine.\" The X Factor continues tonight (October 24) at 8pm on ITV and on Sunday (October 25) at 7.30pm on ITV.
