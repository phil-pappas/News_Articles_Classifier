A hiker was ticketed last weekend by the state Department of Environmental Conservation after photos appeared on Facebook of a keg party at the 4,161-foot summit on Phelps Mountain in the Adirondacks, The Adirondack Explorer reported Wednesday.\nA keg, if you're wondering, weighs between 140 to 170 pounds.\nBut this in case, the revelers indicated that the keg weighed only five gallons and was carried up the mountain in a backpack.\nThe Adirondack Explorer reported that the hiker, Raja Bhatt of Queens, was ticketed for allegedly organizing a hiking group with more than 15 people -- the legal limit for a day hike in the High Peaks Wilderness Area.\nAnd the website posted a Facebook post from Bhatt showing the party, including someone doing a keg stand.\nBhatt, 32, denied any wrongdoing. He faces up to $250 fine and up to 15 days in jail.\n“I was simply on the summit with some friends, and some friend of a friend brought a keg,” he told the paper. “The only reason I got slapped with a ticket is I was the one who posted the photos.\"\nA friend, Natalya Budnyatsky, told the paper: “He wasn’t the mastermind. He took the fall because he took the pictures,” she said.\nShe added, “It wasn’t like people were getting drunk on the mountain. People had a beer and enjoyed the view, and that was it.”\nMore from the Adirondack Explorer :\nDEC says the charge was based on the photos and on an interview with Bhatt. Bhatt said he had finished his Forty-Sixer round the previous day on Whiteface Mountain. The next morning, he hiked Phelps from Adirondak Loj with six or seven friends. He said other friends and acquaintances hiked up the mountain at different times. Bhatt estimated that his circle of friends on the summit numbered no more than fifteen. “Not everyone in those photos was in our group,” he said. Some local hiking groups knocked the party.\n“We neither need nor want members who behave in this fashion,” said Brian Hoody, the president of the Adirondack Forty-Sixers, told the paper.\nNeil Woodworth, executive director of the Adirondack Mountain Club, said: “I am appalled at the idea of a keg party on the summit of Phelps.\"\n(AP Photo)", "external_links": ["http://www.adirondackalmanack.com/2015/10/hiker-ticketed-by-dec-after-keg-party-on-phelps.html"], "published": "2015-10-14T22:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:04:53.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
