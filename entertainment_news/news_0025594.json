The channel, which launched as MuchMusic in 1984, has served as essential teen viewing for over three decades now. \nBut in recent times, youngsters aren’t necessarily paying attention to VJs on TV anymore – they’re more likely to be subscribing to YouTube channels, featuring their favourite digital media personalities. Recent stats from the U.S. show that YouTube reaches more people than any cable network – even if you just include people watching videos on their smartphones. \nSo, you can see why Much would try to emulate the success of YouTube , especially since young viewers seem to be addicted to short-form digital content these days. \nThis year, Bell Media revamped Much’s website to spotlight videos from a new multi-channel network (MCN) of Canadian and international YouTube creators – called Much Digital Studios. \nIf you visit Much.com, you’ll find sections of the website looking a lot like a video streaming network, with online channels dabbling in music, comedy , style, beauty , gaming, travel and more. If you’re a follower of the YouTube scene already, you’ll probably notice some familiar names – like funnyman Jus Reign , who was one of Much’s higher-profile acquisitions for the MCN. \n“It’s cool that more traditional outlets are heading in the direction,” he says, during a recent phone interview with Postmedia Network. “It’s definitely a smart move on their part to get involved with the online space.” \nThe Guelph, Ont.-born performer says that Much offers creators access to production studios at the channel’s iconic headquarters at the corner of Queen St. and John St. in Toronto. And to make the deal even sweeter for creators, Much helps them partner with brands to bring in revenue. Recent brand partnerships have involved companies like PUMA, Bell and Virgin Mobile Canada. \n“They’ll bring you the brand deals, and then we can filter and see which ones fit us best, and how we can go about promoting those specific brands,” says Jus Reign, who jokes that he’s got a few dream deals in his sights. “I’d love to work with Bugatti or Lamborghini, so if you want to write that in the newspaper and tell them to give me a shout, I would love a brand partnership with them. In exchange for a car, possibly.” \nMuch’s roster of 22 creators adds up to a combined YouTube subscriber base of over two million viewers, with Jus Reign’s 600 thousand subscribers making him one of the network’s most popular personalities. The 25-year-old comedian found inspiration in his upbringing – he was the only minority in a school full of white kids – for his hilarious channel, which often draws on issues of race and culture in videos like White vs Brown Christmas, The Brown Tinder, The Best Racists and How to Avoid Arranged Marriages. \nOther standout creators on Much.com include 4YallEntertainment, a group of clever guys from Brampton, Ont., who have caught the attention of Drake and the Toronto Raptors – check out the 4Yall-Raptors collaboration video called 30 More Kinds of Ballers – and Dan Rodo, a Canadian entertainer currently living in Dallas, who blends humour and inspiration to create useful clips for young people, like 6 Tips for Dealing with a Bully or 6 Ways to Deal With Change. \nYou’ll also be able to find a healthy dose of lifestyle content on Much.com, with creators like Tasha Leelyn giving how-to hair dye tutorials – her lesson on silver hair has earned more than five million views – and model Melissa Merk providing make-up and fashion tips. \nIt’s almost as if these online personalities have become the new VJs – like the 2015 versions of Steve Anthony, Bill Welychka, Master T, Erica Ehm and the dozens of other hosts we used to watch between music videos. \nTo illustrate this point, Jus Reign mentions a recent interaction with one of Much’s big names from the ‘90s, which took place at a meet-and-greet event after one of his live performances in Vancouver. \n“These four kids came up to me,” he says. “And then one of them was like, ‘hold on, my mom’s a fan, she wants a picture, too.’ I was like, ‘ok, cool’. So I waited, and then out of nowhere pops up (former Electric Circus host) Monika Deol herself. It was really trippy.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:05:10.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
