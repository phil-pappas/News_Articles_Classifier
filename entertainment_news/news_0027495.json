During the summer, I received a notice from the dealer where it was purchased and was told to wait for further instructions. I called the dealer last week and was told that the replacement part(s) were not received from Toyota yet. Furthermore, they do not know when they'll get it. In the meantime, the dealer recommends that no one sit in the passenger seat. I called around to a couple of other dealers to see whether I'll get the same response. They both told me to make an appointment and they'll look at it. Am I being taken for a ride, or can Toyota issue a recall and not have the replacement parts for the dealers?\n— T.O., Evanston, Ill .\nA: You are not being taken for a ride. With over 30 million recalled air bags, it will take some time to manufacture replacements. The most potentially dangerous vehicles are in high-humidity areas such as coastal Florida. Those cars are getting priority. Meanwhile, limit how often you use your Matrix. Carpool, take public transportation, buy a beater until yours gets fixed. If you want to stay abreast of the recall situation, go to www.safercar.gov . It helps to have your VIN (vehicle identification number) handy.\nQ: I have a 1994 Buick Regal. Recently a rattle or scraping noise started coming from the front right side of the car. A mechanic said it was a warped pulley on the air conditioner compressor. The AC cools just fine. He told me that I need a new air conditioner for about $800 to $1,000 to fix the noise. I was advised to just let the noise continue until the AC stops working. Is there another way to fix the problem?\n— S.S., Elgin, Ill.\nA: Although the possibility exists, we have not seen many warped pulleys. Also, bad pulleys usually cause belt noises such a squeal or drumming. The noise you describe more commonly comes from the electromagnetic clutch for the compressor, which is attached to the pulley. The clutch assembly can be replaced separately from the compressor for a lot less. This is a job that most dealership shops will shy away from. It is much quicker to replace the entire compressor and move on to the next job. Search for an independent shop that is known for AC work. It requires a set of special tools. Ask your friends and co-workers for leads.\nWhat you need to know about the Takata air bag recall Tribune wire reports A recall of air bags made by Japanese auto parts supplier Takata Corp. now has the dubious distinction of being the largest in U.S. history.\nThe number of vehicles in the U.S. being recalled because of the defective air bags is doubling to 34 million, safety regulators said Tuesday.\nHere are some...\nA recall of air bags made by Japanese auto parts supplier Takata Corp. now has the dubious distinction of being the largest in U.S. history.\nThe number of vehicles in the U.S. being recalled because of the defective air bags is doubling to 34 million, safety regulators said Tuesday.\nHere are some...\n(Tribune wire reports) Q: I have a 2011 Chevrolet Malibu purchased four years, four months and 17,000 miles ago. With my foot on the brake, the brake pedal begins to sink to the floor. I am afraid the car will not stay stopped. The Chevy dealer bled the calipers and installed a new master cylinder, but those repairs did not eliminate the sinking pedal. What do you think is the cause?\n— G.F., Burbank, Ill .\nA: If this is a new behavior, there is definitely a problem with the hydraulic system. Our first thought would be a faulty master cylinder, but that has been eliminated. Air in the system is next. Although the front calipers were bled (purged of any air), there could be air in the lines to the rear brakes. Keep in mind that the brake pedal on nearly every car can be pushed to the floor with enough oomph. It is called push-through and is not a safety issue.\nBob Weber is an ASE-certified master mechanic and freelance writer.\nSend questions along with name and town to Motormouth, Rides, Chicago Tribune, 435 N.
