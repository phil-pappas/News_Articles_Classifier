And in three hours, director J.J. Abrams' new instalment of the sci-fi saga had clocked up 30,000 tickets.\nIn Sydney, the most popular Event cinemas for Star Wars fans were George Street in the city, Bondi Junction, Miranda and Parramatta.\nA spokesman for the chain said its previous best one-day advanced ticket sales were for The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn â€“ Part 2 , with 7,726, and Harry Potter and The Deathly Hollows Part 2 , with 7,258.\nThe first Star Wars movie in a decade quickly topped the chain's entire pre-sales for The Avengers , 26,988 tickets, before that ensemble superhero movie went on to take $53.2 million at the Australian box office.\nAhead of its opening on December 17, Disney has ramped up the hype for The Force Awakens by releasing a new trailer and poster as advanced tickets went on sale.\nWith two other big movies headed for cinemas next month - the James Bond movie Spectre on November 12 and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part II on November 19 - it shapes as a booming end to the year for Australian cinemas.\nWhile nothing is guaranteed until The Force Awakens screens - remember the hype before the two Matrix sequels opened in 2003? - the cinema industry will expect Star Wars to be one of the few films to break $50 million at the box office.\nThe optimists hope it has a shot at topping Avatar 's exceptional $115.6 million but that will require a strongly positive response to the movie - with no Jar Jar Binks style backlash from die-hard fans - and many repeat visits by fans over summer.\n\"We anticipated the ticket sales for Star Wars: The Force Awakens to break records,\" said David Seargeant, group managing director of Amalgamated Holdings Ltd, which operates Event, Greater Union and Birch, Carroll & Coyle cinemas. \"However, the pace in which this film has achieved this is remarkable.\"\nDisney acquired the Star Wars franchise when it bought Lucasfilm in 2012, announcing a new trilogy, three more standalone films and related expansions to its theme park business.\n\"Judging by the unprecedented ticket pre-sale numbers for Star Wars: The Force Awakens , it's clear that The Force is strong in Australia,\" said Catherine Powell, managing director of Disney in Australia and New Zealand.\n\"Whilst we expected significant interest from the many passionate Star Wars fans in this country, we are delighted with the overwhelming response from Australians who want to experience the next chapter of this epic story during opening weekend and beyond.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:25:59.641+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
