At the Trewarne jewellery boutique opening in Collins Street on Tuesday night one of the event hashtags was #ibelieveinlove so we wanted to know, what moment, or person, made you believe.\nJade Bradford (left) and Pascale Coade at Bar Schweppes launch, Flinders Lane.

It's going to be a massive crazy event on a rooftop with a bubble machine and lots of flowers, like a garden in the sky. The longer you're engaged the less wedding-y and the more just big party it becomes.\" \nAdvertisement \"It was a pair of shoes that I bought a couple of weeks ago,\" Chantelle Ford said. \"I was just reading over a text I sent to a friend, I said, 'I don't know if I have any love left for any other being, ever. I'm going to die alone but I think I'm OK with that, that's how much I love these shoes.' And they were 50 per cent off. Cheap love is also good.\"\n\"Dancing in St Mark's Square in Venice with my now husband,\" said Sarah Ware . \"He said that was the moment he wished he'd proposed; he proposed a year later.  That was the moment when we both kind of knew, 'Yep, it's forever.'\"\nHnako Kajiya (left) and Lady Petrova at Trewarne boutique opening, Collins Street.

Is your favourite piece of jewellery a gift, something you bought yourself or something you made?\n\"A gift; it's a ring,\" Sharon Fernandez , principal dancer with the Melbourne Ballet Company, said. And why were you given that gift? \"Because someone loves me very, very, very much; I had an idea it was coming but I wasn't expecting it when it happened.\" Did you cry, what did you do? \"I think I went bright red and just said, 'Thank you, thank you, thank you so much.' And a kiss and a cuddle.\" \nRenowned Melbourne artist Kate Rohde , who produced an exclusive collection of jewellery for the launch using a 3D printing pen, said, \"I think probably something that I've made but it always changes because you're always making new things.\" So the next thing you make is your new favourite? \"That's right; I've always got a new favourite. I haven't made the next favourite yet.\"\n \nLet yourself be lost and found \nBar Schweppes launch, city \nIt's a secret, they want you to get lost, embrace it. On Thursday night it was the Bar Schweppes launch, a cocktails-only bar open Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays until November 7. Register online at london.barschweppes.com.au and the address is revealed on the day of your booking, or you can walk in if you find it.\nWhen was the last time you were lost . . . emotionally? \"I am a little bit of a lost soul,\" Pascale Coade said. \"But I think you've got to stop searching too much and just be yourself. I've spent a lot of time searching to be perfect at whatever I'm doing and you've got to try not to do that.\"\n\"I did a big trip to Europe last year,\" said Josh Bozin.  \"I thought I was going to kind of work out where I was going with my life, because I'd finished uni, and I got home, no idea, but things have fallen into place.\"\n\"Breaking up with my girlfriend of five years, a month and a half ago,\" Dalton Graham said. \"I wouldn't say I'm lost but I'm still finding my feet. I'm moving all right, but I'm just, yeah, finding my feet.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T16:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:33:53.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
