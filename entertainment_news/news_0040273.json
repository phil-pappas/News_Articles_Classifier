On its Facebook page, there was a collective o h, bugger from its fans.\nActually, there’s more to the story. Owner Nick Spencer is closing Jolly Posh, yes, but he’s keeping the store and culinary team (led by Alinea/Next alumnus Garrett Christiansen), and the restaurant will launch a new concept in the space in November. He’s keeping details of the concept close to the chest but did say it would “100 percent be another restaurant. It’ll be a pretty quick turnaround.”\nIts iteration as a retail grocer (3755 N. Southport Ave.) was manna for British expats, who could find Walker’s crisps, PG Tips, Lucozade, Maltesers and an assortment of other foods from across the pond. But that end of the business had declined enough to not support the prime Southport real estate rent. The Jolly Posh brand will return to its meat roots, Spencer said, and will continue selling its bangers, rashers and black puddings wholesale and at farmers markets.\nkpang@tribpub.com\nTwitter @pang\nPrivacy Policy Owen & Engine", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/pang", "http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.jollyposh.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/SpencerFoods/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561fbefd/turbine/ct-british-grocer-cafe-jolly-posh-closes-new-restaurant-concept-20151015"], "published": "2015-10-15T18:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:15:31.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
