Genesee St., said ArtWauk, from 5-9 p.m., dovetailed with the downtown events.\n\"We had the regular ArtWauk patrons that come every third Saturday, people from (Green Town Tavern) across the street and a few zombie stragglers dropping in,\" said Patch.\nWhile Waukegan's struggling art community has gained a foothold in the city, explained Patch, \"People don't realize the amount of work and financial investment made by artists. They don't understand the money spent on materials, promotions and fees.\nZombies still hungry for music 50 years after British Invasion Bob Kostanczuk The Zombies were part of the historic \"British Invasion\" that steam rolled America in the mid 1960s.\nAs was the case with many of those English acts, the band from the London suburb of St. Albans was often the target of frenetic, screaming girls.\n\"It was the heritage of the Beatles, I think, really,\"...\nThe Zombies were part of the historic \"British Invasion\" that steam rolled America in the mid 1960s.\nAs was the case with many of those English acts, the band from the London suburb of St. Albans was often the target of frenetic, screaming girls.\n\"It was the heritage of the Beatles, I think, really,\"...\n(Bob Kostanczuk) Typical prices for framed, professional art in Waukegan runs between $100 to $500, said Patch, with some items selling for $2,000.\n\"We have some artists who are full time,\" Patch added, \"but many work full time and do this as a passion.\"\nWaukegan special events director David Motley said \"This (fifth) was the largest ZombieWauk we've had to date. It's a great way of bringing people downtown during the ArtWauk event, themed toward Halloween.\n\"People have a huge amount of entertainment choices. This is one way Waukegan can set itself apart from other things taking place around the county.\n\"I appreciate the fact that so many different groups of people were here. It was an all-around awesome time. The city doesn't own these events; the people do and people along the downtown Genesee corridor are taking charge and leading us to the future.\n\"Everyone has to find a niche and zombies are a popular theme right now,\" he added.\nTeen's charity event to fight hunger impresses Magic Johnson Patricia Trebe In just a few years, Destiny Watson went from a shy introvert to the organizer of 40 high school students who will transform into zombies and descend on Apollo Park in Homewood Saturday for the We Scare Hunger Trail charity event.\nWatson, 17, will be directing the students in a scare fest unlike...\nIn just a few years, Destiny Watson went from a shy introvert to the organizer of 40 high school students who will transform into zombies and descend on Apollo Park in Homewood Saturday for the We Scare Hunger Trail charity event.\nWatson, 17, will be directing the students in a scare fest unlike...\n(Patricia Trebe) Among the special niche entertainment was a full-size coach bus, redone into \"Daddy War Bus,\" similar to the outlandish vehicles featured in Mel Gibson's Mad Max/Road Warrior movie series.\nBus owner Matthew Stratton is a full-time \"armorer\" in the entertainment industry, on the TV series \"Empire.\"\n\"We're there to make sure the weapons are handled safely, the right loads are in the guns and the all-around safety of the crew,\" said Stratton of his daytime gig.\nStratton, whose walk-through bus display at ZombieWauk was paid for by the city, said \"This was the (Jimmy) Buffet party bus at one point.\n\"We bought the bus and stripped it, then built in the bunks, bathroom, galley and filled it with (movie industry) fake weapons and armored this thing out.\"\nThe display inside the bus contains 93 firearms, 27 bladed weapons, two rocket launchers, one flamethrower, a .50-caliber machine gun and about 3,000 rounds of belted ammunition.\n\"Everything on here is fake,\" said Stratton. \"It's either replica, rubber, airsoft (replica weapons that fire soft projectiles) and props for the TV or film industry.\"\nFor the first time at ZombieWauk, the city brought in a food vendor, Two Soldiers and a Marine, which reportedly sold out of pulled pork sandwiches, BBQ and mac and cheese entrees.\nDowntown taverns like Booner's Place, Up North Pub and Green Town Tavern did a brisk business Saturday with the Cubs game.\nDenys Bucksten is a freelancer for the News-Sun.\nCopyright Â© 2015, Lake County News-Sun Chicago Cubs", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56242387/turbine/ct-lns-waukegan-zombies-st-1019-20151018", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561fc465/turbine/ct-ptb-zombies-star-plaza-st-1016-20151015", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56201b69/turbine/ct-sta-homewood-zombie-trail-event-st-1016-20151015"], "published": "2015-10-19T01:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:41:07.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
