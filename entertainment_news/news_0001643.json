Photo by David McNew/Getty Images While appearing on Sunday's edition of ABC’s “This Week,” Bernie Sanders , the socialist senator running for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, said that if elected, he would raise payroll taxes on everyone in the country in order to pay for family and medical leave. According to Sanders, the move would be necessary in order to make the United States more like other industrialized nations that offer the same benefit.\n“I think if you are looking about guaranteeing paid family and medical leave, which every other major country has so that when a mom gives birth she doesn’t have to go back to work in two weeks,\" he said. \"Dad or mom can stay home with the kids. That will require a small increase in the payroll tax .”\n\"That’s going to hit everybody,\" said ABC's George Stephanopoulos. Sanders acknowledged the increased tax would hit everyone, but said it is necessary in order to put the United States on par with other nations.\n“That would hit everybody, yeah, It would but it would mean we were drawing the rest of the industrialized world and make sure that when a mom has a baby she can in fact stay home with that baby for three months rather than go back to work at the end of one week,\" he said. \"We are the only country, only major country that doesn’t guarantee paid family and medical leave. We do a lot of great things in this country but we are behind many other countries in protecting the middle class and working families.”\nHe also hit back at Donald Trump, who recently called him a \" socialist slash Communist .\" According to Sanders, Americans are already seeing income redistribution, but in his view, the wealth is going in the wrong direction.\n\"What we have seen, George, in the last 30 years -- as most Americans know -- is a massive redistribution of wealth,\" Sanders told Stephanopoulos. \"Unfortunately, it's gone in the wrong direction: It's gone from the middle class and working families to Donald Trump and his friends, the top one-10th of [the] 1 percent.\"\nSanders says that trend needs to change, and his solution is to tax the wealthy more. \"We have massive wealth and income inequality -- the wealthy are going to have to pay more in taxes.\" But as Sanders admitted Sunday, he will have to tax every American in order to pay for his left-wing policies.", "external_links": ["http://conservativefiringline.com/video-donald-trump-calls-maniac-bernie-sanders-a-socialist-slash-communist/", "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/10/18/sanders-would-raise-payroll-taxes-on-everyone-to-fund-paid-family-leave/", "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bernie-sanders-proposed-payroll-tax-hit/story?id=34546554"], "published": "2015-10-19T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:23:00.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
