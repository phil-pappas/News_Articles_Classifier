(Photo: Courtesy of Webster Public Relations)\n63 CONNECT 45 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE On the Road Again, USA TODAY's spotlight on artists on tour, looks at Meat Loaf this week.\nThe last Meat Loaf show. \"I already kind of know how I'm going to die,\" says Meat Loaf. \"Of an aneurysm. And I think it'll be on stage.\" The Paradise by the Dashboard Light singer says his band has instructions on what to do if he suddenly drops dead during a performance: \"If it's too morbid to leave me lying there, then they'll take me off, and the band will play When the Saints Go Marching In . Then the piano player will play Take Me Out to the Ballgame , and the band will get everybody to stand up and sing. Even if I'm dead, the show's going on.\"\nBack at bat. The tour that starts Friday in Albuquerque, which will feature extended rock epics like Bat Out of Hell and I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That), will be the 68-year-old singer's first tour in two years. \"In October 2014, I had major back surgery,\" the 68-year-old singer says. \"They didn't know how major it was going to be until they got in there. I was supposed to be in the hospital for three days. I was in the hospital for 17 days, then I was in therapy for four months. When that was over, I had to have four outpatient surgeries on my back and two on my knee.\"\nLearning the room. Whenever Meat Loaf plays a venue for the first time, he likes to arrive several hours early. \"I'll walk the entire room, because I want the feel of the room,\" he says. \"I want to see where the sight lines are. If we've sold tickets over to the far side, I want to make sure nothing's blocking them.\"\nGetting into character. \"I would say 99% of singers listen to themselves on tour â€” I don't,\" Meat Loaf says. Instead, the singer, whose film credits include Fight Club and The Rocky Horror Picture Show , creates an onstage character to inhabit. \"Each song is a different character, and each song has a different body movement. It goes deep, dude.\"\nHe knows how Lenny Kravitz feels. \"I split my pants, and I was wearing no underwear,\" Meat Loaf recalls. Something similar happened to Kravitz in August in Sweden, but Meat Loaf can see Kravitz his wardrobe malfunction and raise him a level of embarrassment: \"On live TV in Germany.\"\nAin't no doubt it, Meat is doubly blessed. The singer's surgeries have delayed the release of his next album, tentatively titled Braver Than We Are . The album, which he was been recording in Nashville, is expected out in the spring of 2016 and will include several songs by Jim Steinman, the producer and songwriter who collaborated with Meat Loaf on his biggest hits. One song will feature a pair of duet partners from years past, Ellen Foley and Karla DeVito. \"It's a 12-minute song,\" Meat Loaf says. \"We trade in and out; we sing together. I sing verses, they sing verses. We trade lines. We sing choruses together. I'm the only one who knows how it fits together. No one else in the world, not even Jim, knows how it fits together.\"\n //usat.ly/1LpatgY TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c69a75dbf7bd625c32b733a05367202f318eb58d/r=265x400/local/-/media/2015/09/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/635783666200214119--DSC9285.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/635783666200214119--DSC9285.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5675456352682cc53f9aaa025773b01c1b1f81ac/c=0-351-4081-5792&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/09/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/635783666200214119--DSC9285.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LpatgY&text=On%20the%20Road%20Again%3A%20Meat%20Loaf&via=usatoday", "http://usat.ly/1LpatgY", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LpatgY&mini=true"], "published": "2015-10-11T15:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T17:05:19.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
