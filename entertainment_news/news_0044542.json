It was later changed to \"Help! Canâ€™t decide on my Halloween costume this year! What do you guys think of this lion costume? @yandy #thanksyandy #halloweencostume.\" \nOct 6, 2015 at 1:57pm PDT \nBenson didn't take the updated post down, which raised some eyebrows, but Thursday she's explaining why. \n\"Yesterday's post was in poor taste and I absolutely regret all of the hurt that photo caused,\" she wrote . \"The caption that was posted was incorrect and my costume was not Cecil the Lion, when I saw that, I contacted my management who handled the post and had it immediately changed.\" \nShe added that she is responsible for her social media and alluded to the fact that the picture was part of a deal with Yandy, a \"sexy costumes, swimwear, clothing, and more\" store, according to its Instagram page. \n\"I am a supporter of Animal conservation and I will be donating all the proceeds of this deal to the World Wildlife Fund,\" she added. \nOct 7, 2015 at 5:13pm PDT \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:00:23.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
