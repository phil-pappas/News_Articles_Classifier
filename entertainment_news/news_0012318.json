Children are divided into groups by age — 2-6 and 7-12 — and tickets are $20 in advance or $25 the day of the event. \nIF YOU GO \nWhat: Tybee Island Kids Shark Tooth/Fossil Hunt \nWhen: 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Oct. 18 \nWhere: Tybee Island, North Beach \nCost: $20 advance; $25 day of event \nInfo: www.StaffordPromotions.com/SavannahEvents \nAccompanying adults are admitted free. The event benefits Tybee Island Marine Science Center and tickets can be purchased online. \nStafford says he’s had the idea for a shark tooth hunt on Tybee for a while and through his research, he stumbled upon Mike Harris, aka the Shark Tooth Fairy and Capt. Morgan , out of Beaufort, S.C. \nStafford says Harris puts on these types of events and is also a diver who finds the shark teeth, including the prehistoric Megalodon teeth that are as big as 7 inches long. \nHarris will be at the Tybee event to help identify teeth as they are found and he is also donating several large Megalodon teeth for children to discover and take home. \nAt the hunt, children will also be able to find prehistoric mako, bull, sand, great white and snaggletooth shark teeth/fossils. \nStafford says shark tooth hunters can come out as early at 10 a.m. to begin searching for teeth and stay as long as they want, but he asks that children only keep 20 teeth each so there are enough to go around. If you find 20 teeth but want to keep looking, that’s OK. \nStafford says to just put back smaller teeth and keep searching for bigger teeth. \nStafford and his staff will begin hiding teeth at 9 a.m. and his stash includes 25 Megalodon teeth and about 15,000 smaller teeth. \nThe event features other educational activities and food from Toppin’ Hotdogs Café. \n“This is just the first one,” he adds. I want to eventually do two a year, one in the fall and one in spring ... I want these events to be huge with live music and more vendors. I want to make it so big so that everyone knows ... what day the annual Shark Tooth Hunt is.” \nWhile Stafford expects the weather to be beautiful, he does want people to remember that parking on North Beach is limited and everyone should plan ahead. \nShuttles and taxis are available all over the island and Stafford has a list of shuttle providers and phone numbers, as well as a list of rules/regulations, on his Facebook event page for the hunt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:05:59.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
