The ensuing battle for equality and LGBT rights was the subject of a short documentary (2007) called Freeheld; that film won an Oscar. \nThe new feature film — also called Freeheld — starring Julianne Moore as Detective Hester and Ellen Page as Stacie Andree is sincere, to be sure, but unlikely to win any prizes. For starters, the most memorable character in this important story of a courageous woman is a man; that's a problem. \nThe man in question is Michael Shannon, who plays Dane Wells, Laurel Hester's police partner. He, Moore and Page all give note-perfect performances, but it's Shannon's character we follow as he is moved to crusade for these women and their right to the same benefits as any other member of the police family. \nFreeheld begins with Laurel and Stacie meeting at a basketball game. Their relationship progresses quickly, although it is marked by the secrecy Laurel maintains to keep her police colleagues from knowing her orientation. The women buy a house, move in together and formalize their domestic partnership; the story begins around 2003, a decade before same-sex marriage is permitted in New Jersey. \n(Same-sex marriage is already legal in several provinces by 2003, so Freeheld no doubt plays differently for Canadian audiences.) \nLaurel and Stacie have barely begun living together when Laurel's cancer is discovered. Laurel does not predict a happy ending. She wants to ensure Stacie's financial future, and her pension will let Stacie afford to stay in the house after Laurel dies. \nIt's up to the Freeholders, who oversee public policy in Ocean City, to decide if Laurel's pension can go to her domestic partner. They deny her motion, and the battle is on. \nLaurel's police partner is ready to fight for her. Also in her corner is same sex marriage advocate Steven Goldstein, a loud, proud, outspoken gay man (Steve Carell, turning his flamboyance dial up to 11 for this role – to no avail.) \nEventually, all the macho policemen who initially refused to back Laurel's cause are likewise on her side. \nIt's rousing and uplifting and all that, but it's also predictable. Given the story and the cast, the wonder here is that the final product is so flat, so lacking in highs and lows; the emotion is missing. Neither Laurel's declining health nor her eventual triumph over inequity register much with a viewer — everything about Freeheld seems anticlimactic. And you never forget that you're watching a movie. \nThe emotion you're after is available at the end, with the inclusion of photos of the real Laurel Hester and Stacie Andree. It’s interesting that a few still photographs say more than a whole movie. \nTwitter: @LizBraunSun", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T00:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:42:33.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
