The actor was speaking at the London film festival premiere of his latest film Black Mass, in which he plays a politician - William \"Billy\" Bulger, the brother of Boston mobster and FBI informant James \"Whitey\" Bulger.\n\"No, government is not doing enough and I'm quite happy to say that,\" Cumberbatch said.\n\"I'd like to sit down with Theresa May and get a full understanding of how her political economic model works of structuring an argument that there is virtually a zero degree of financial benefit from an immigrant population.\"\nHe talked passionately about what he feels is the inadequacy of Britain's current proposals, saying more should be done.\nPlay video \"Benedict's Message To Refugees\" Video: Benedict's Message To Refugees \"I think we need to do a lot more and we have to be careful and we have to do it in the right way and maybe that's what the Government would argue they're doing,\" Cumberbatch said.\n\"There's just a huge crisis and not enough is being done about what is happening now.\n\"Yes we need long-term solutions and yes it's a good idea to get people out of camps so they don't make the perilous journey, yes it's a good idea to have a specific solution for them once they arrive here.\n\"But in the meantime 5,000 people a day are arriving in Lesbos and there's nothing on the shoreline but abandoned lifejackets and there are boats as far as you can see on the horizon day and night and it's happening.\n\"So to say 20,000 over five years when 5,000 are arriving in one day on one island - we've all got to wake up.\"\n1 / 6 Gallery: First Look At Cumberbatch As Hamlet\nBenedict Cumberbatch on stage as Hamlet at the Barbican in London\nCumberbatch recently lent his support to the charity single Help is Coming, which was re-released with Save the Children to raise money for refugees fleeing to Europe.\nHe has also been encouraging audiences at the sell-out performances of Hamlet to donate money to the cause.\nAs well as talking about the refugee crisis, Cumberbatch also told Sky News being a father was now \"everything\" to him.\nHe said: \"He's doing great and Sophie's being amazing. And as any new parent knows, it hits you like a truck but it also then ignites and kicks off something you didn't realise you had, that reserve of energy and God does it focus you.\n\"It gives you perspective, in the blink of an eye it gives you a massive amount for your work and that becomes everything, the work is something I sort of do but that is everything for me.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T14:55:49.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
