Box Office Top 20: 'Pan' flops with $15.3 million 1 / 3 Back to Gallery LOS ANGELES (AP) — \"Pan\" fared even worse than expected in its dismal 3,515-screen debut. The $150 million live-action Peter Pan origin story netted $15.3 million in its first days in theaters according to Rentrak reported actuals on Monday. Sunday estimates had the film at a slightly better $15.5 million.\nThe disinterest in \"Pan\" surprised both Warner Bros. and box office trackers, who had expected it to open at least in the $20 million range. Sony's high-wire spectacle \"The Walk\" also proved to be wobbly in its first weekend in wide release, earning only $3.7 million from over 2,500 locations.\nInstead, audiences kept crowd-pleaser \"The Martian\" and the family-friendly \"Hotel Transylvania 2\" afloat in the first and second place spots. \" Steve Jobs ,\" which played on four screens this weekend, also had reason to celebrate with its $130,380 per-screen average — a promising start as the biopic expands across the next two weeks.\nThe top 20 movies at U.S. and Canadian theaters Friday through Sunday, followed by distribution studio, gross, number of theater locations, average receipts per location, total gross and number of weeks in release, as compiled Monday by Rentrak:\n1. \"The Martian,\" 20th Century Fox, $37,005,266, 3,854 locations, $9,602 average, $108,715,595, 2 weeks.\n2. \"Hotel Transylvania 2,\" Sony, $20,420,392, 3,768 locations, $5,419 average, $116,942,033, 3 weeks.\n3. \"Pan,\" Warner Bros., $15,315,435, 3,515 locations, $4,357 average, $15,315,435, 1 week.\n4. \"The Intern,\" Warner Bros., $8,678,187, 3,224 locations, $2,692 average, $49,592,234, 3 weeks.\n5. \"Sicario,\" Lionsgate, $7,579,324, 2,620 locations, $2,893 average, $26,935,340, 4 weeks.\n6. \"Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,\" 20th Century Fox, $5,371,941, 2,838 locations, $1,893 average, $70,765,331, 4 weeks.\n7. \"The Walk,\" Sony, $3,719,177, 2,509 locations, $1,482 average, $6,430,676, 2 weeks.\n8. \"Black Mass,\" Warner Bros., $3,118,427, 2,057 locations, $1,516 average, $57,557,218, 4 weeks.\n9. \"Everest,\" Universal, $3,073,035, 2,120 locations, $1,450 average, $38,253,250, 4 weeks.\n10. \"The Visit,\" Universal, $2,523,505, 1,759 locations, $1,435 average, $61,158,030, 5 weeks.\n11. \"War Room,\" Sony, $1,850,214, 1,395 locations, $1,326 average, $63,570,344, 7 weeks.\n12. \"The Perfect Guy,\" Sony, $1,415,640, 887 locations, $1,596 average, $54,737,351, 5 weeks.\n13. \"Ladrones,\" Lionsgate, $1,411,031, 375 locations, $3,763 average, $1,411,031, 1 week.\n14. \"He Named Me Malala,\" Fox Searchlight , $687,169, 446 locations, $1,541 average, $770,617, 2 weeks.\n15. \"99 Homes,\" Broad Green Pictures, $647,825, 691 locations, $938 average, $825,431, 3 weeks.\n16. \"Rudrama Devi (Telugu),\" BlueSky Cinemas, $628,134, 135 locations, $4,653 average, $757,031, 1 week.\n17. \"Steve Jobs,\" Universal, $521,522, 4 locations, $130,380 average, $521,522, 1 week.\n18. \"Inside Out,\" Disney, $440,608, 322 locations, $1,368 average, $354,363,926, 17 weeks.\n19. \"Goodbye Mr. Loser,\" China Lion Entertainment, $363,949, 22 locations, $16,543 average, $363,949, 1 week.\n20. \"The Green Inferno,\" High Top Releasing, $353,132, 515 locations, $686 average, $6,833,445, 3 weeks.\n---\nUniversal and Focus are owned by NBC Universal, a unit of Comcast Corp.; Sony, Columbia, Sony Screen Gems and Sony Pictures Classics are units of Sony Corp. ; Paramount is owned by Viacom Inc. ; Disney, Pixar and Marvel are owned by The Walt Disney Co.; Miramax is owned by Filmyard Holdings LLC; 20th Century Fox and Fox Searchlight are owned by 21st Century Fox; Warner Bros. and New Line are units of Time Warner Inc. ; MGM is owned by a group of former creditors including Highland Capital, Anchorage Advisors and Carl Icahn ; Lionsgate is owned by Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.; IFC is owned by AMC Networks Inc.; Rogue is owned by Relativity Media LLC.", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/76/8773514/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/76/8773514/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/76/8773513/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/36/8779675/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/76/8773513/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/36/8779675/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-13T01:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:58:22.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
