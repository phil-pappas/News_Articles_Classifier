Back | Next Back | Next Back | Next Related Stories UPDATE: 4 former Savannah-Chatham cops sue ex-chief Lovett, others in police corruption case By Eric Curl The Savannah City Council on Thursday voted to represent former City Manager Michael Brown and Assistant Police Chief Julie Tolbert — as well as one former and one current Savannah-Chatham police officer — in a corruption lawsuit filed early this month.\nThe civil suit by four former Savannah-Chatham police officers accuses 14 former and current police, county and city officials with violating Georgia’s Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.\nCity Attorney Brooks Stillwell recommended that the city approve the defense requests of Brown and Tolbert, as well as Rodney Gerido, a former police sergeant, and Greg Ramsey, a police lieutenant still with the department, based on the 2013-2014 findings of an independent consultant’s investigation of the department that lead to the firing and prosecution of a number of officers.\n“The people we have decided to defend have done nothing wrong,” Stillwell said.\nThe city, as well as county, is not named in the suit and will not be responsible for paying any judgments against the selected defendants, Stillwell said, if such damages end up being awarded.\nThe suit filed by attorney Will Claiborne in Chatham County Superior Court alleges that now-incarcerated former Police Chief Willie Lovett and several of his cronies seized control of the department to “serve their own illicit purposes” and that current and former city and county officials actively supported the resulting corruption.\nThe plaintiffs — former officer Peter Delatorre, Michael Delatorre, Robert von Loewenfeldt and Lawrence Harris — contend they were forced or had no choice but to resign from the police department after being retaliated against by Lovett for trying to end the corruption within the department.\nThey are seeking a jury trial and damages, in part stemming from Lovett’s actions that they say were an effort to force them to quit their jobs and eliminated any chance for promotion.\nAfter being forced to retire in 2013, Lovett, also named in the suit, was convicted the next year on federal corruption charges for protecting an illegal gambling operation.\nBefore recommending the four defendants, Stillwell explained to the council that the city typically represents employees sued in performance of city work when their is no finding of wrong-doing and that the recommended defendants had requested such representation. He said the city may get additional requests that would be considered.\n“I think it’s important we stand behind city employees who have not done anything wrong,” he said.\nAlderman Van Johnson requested the city try to clear the name of Andre Oliver, a former police lieutenant who is now deceased and who was also named in the suit. Johnson said he understood Oliver to be in good standing with the department.\n“That really concerned me that his name was included in that,” he said.\nDefendants named in corruption suit:\n• Lovett, former police chief now serving a federal prison sentence for protecting a gambling operation\n• Pete Liakakis, former Chatham County Commission chairman\n• Russell Abolt, former Chatham County manager\n• Michael Brown, former city of Savannah manager\n• Julie Tolbert, Savannah-Chatham assistant chief\n• Malik Khaalis, former police sergeant\n• Willet Williams, former star corporal\n• Floyd Sawyer, former Savannah police officer\n• James Williams, Willet’s brother and a former corrections officer at Georgia State Prison\n• Rodney Gerido, former police sergeant\n• Cedric Phillips, former police captain\n• Eric Henderson, former police sergeant\n• Greg Ramsey, police lieutenant\n• Henry “Hank” Wiley III, former director of the Savannah-Chatham internal affairs unit\n• Andre Oliver, former police lieutenant\nIn other actions, the council:\n• Approved revisions to a tour service ordinance eliminating a testing requirement for tour guides and adding new tour operation restrictions.\n• Approved a $648,000 contract for construction services with Myrick Marine to repair the riverwalk dock adjacent the Savannah River Landing site.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14813295.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14813295.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14813233.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14813211.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14813233.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14813211.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14813234.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14813234.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T11:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:04:34.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
