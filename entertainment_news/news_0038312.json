But violent crime isn’t one of those times. Instead, in a community that markets itself as the “Hostess City of the South” it pays to be great, not lucky. That starts with having an optimal number of police officers.\nThe city’s thin blue line is budgeted for 605 sworn officers. But instead of a line, it’s more like a slice of Swiss cheese. The latest statistics from the Savannah-Chatham police department show 59 vacancies on the force, with another 11 sworn officers on leave. That leaves a net 535 officers available for duty. If you keep crunching that number, that means about 134 officers are available for each of four eight-hour shifts (including off time), or, just 27 per shift at each of Metro’s five precincts.\nIf you use the “rule of 60” as defined by the International City County Management Association, a professional organization for government chief execs, 60 percent of your police force should be assigned to uniform patrol, which it calls the “backbone of policing.” That means 16 officers are on patrol on each shift in each precinct — including the downtown precinct, where the number of people who need protecting (residents, non-resident workers, tourists and other visitors) goes up and down like a yo-yo depending on the day and time. I’m no police analyst, but I know what my eyes tell me, and I find it inconceivable to expect so few patrol officers to adequately protect this population. And when you throw in the 13 million visitors who come here each year, according to Visit Savannah’s Joe Marinelli, you wonder how so few officers can keep up and whether having just 605 officers in the city’s budget is setting the city up for a huge public safety failure in the interest of keeping costs down so elected officials can look good at budget time. These officials must support any reasonable request to beef up the force and pay for it. They also need to get out of City Hall more often to see what’s going on.\nAbout 2:20 a.m. last Sunday, 23-year-old Joseph Heyward brought a gun to City Market and killed 24-year-old Frank Wilson, according to police. The murder appeared to be a retaliatory act because of previous violence between two families, police said. Wilson is the sixth person in three months to get shot in the City Market area, one of the city’s prime downtown destinations for tourists and residents. He has the tragic distinction of being the first fatality. Only 11 weeks ago, at almost the same time (in the wee hours of a Sunday) an argument between two men in Ellis Square ended in a shooting that left five bystanders wounded. Police are looking for two hot-headed gunmen who can’t shoot straight. That narrows the suspect list to about 1,000 knuckleheads.\nBut it takes a real knucklehead to pull out a handgun in a crowded place like Ellis Square or City Market on a weekend night and start blasting away. But sadly, Savannah seems to have no shortage of these morons. At about 5 p.m. Friday, Sept. 25, a shooter inside a dark gray sedan fired a couple of shots at 23-year-old Kwame Williams, who was walking on Bull Street at this time when downtown workers are headed home and visitors at the nearby Juliette Gordon Low House, which just closed, were headed elsewhere. Williams suffered a non-life-theatening wound. Fortunately, he was the only person hit by flying lead. But one of the bullets pierced a window at the Low House gift shop at Bull and York Lane, a favorite place for Girl Scouts who are visiting Savannah.\nAs columnist Polly Powers Stramm reported Oct. 2, a retired teacher from McDonough, Tricia Austin, who was visiting this area that week, accompanied her daughter, Helen Lee Ray, and her granddaughter, Helen, a 7-year-old Brownie scout, to the Low House that Friday afternoon. As bad luck would have it, mom and grandma and little Helen had finished their tour and were shopping for gifts when the knucklehead in the car started spraying bullets. Stramm wrote that the family literally dodged them.\n“I heard ‘pop, pop, pop’ and recognized the sound as a gunshot,” Helen Ray explained. “I looked up and saw a hole in the window near where Tricia had been standing. Several bamboo umbrellas were sitting on a ledge by the window and, when the glass pane was hit, one of the umbrellas fell over and hit Tricia, who was that close, Helen Ray said.\nI can’t help it and hope I’m wrong. But all of this downtown gunplay has me thinking a morbid thought — that Savannah is one dead Girl Scout or one dead German tourist away from toxic headlines that could kill its robust tourism economy deader than a Sunday night in Pooler. It’s not that the murders of residents like Frank Wilson are less serious than deaths of non-residents — all lives matter. But it’s a fact of life and the world we live in that the taking of some lives tend to get more media attention than others, and it can cause wider damage. Indeed, crime in Savannah has been a topic of discussion on the Trip Advisor website this year, as this posting from Jan. 19 illutrates: “Hi...I’m considering relocating and/or splitting time between Savannah and MA. While there’s no question my heart sings when I see the architecture and the pics of the city, I keep reading about an exceedingly and alarmingly high crime rate. Can someone give me the real_deal on what it’s like?” That same day, someone responded: “OK, I live here. The crime here is bad, period. Much of it is drug-related and/or crimes of opportunity... Crime happens, as in any city. Use common sense, that’s the best we can tell you.”\nI agree, although a wise philosopher once said that common sense isn’t all that common. Besides, the last thing on the minds of most tourists who come here for fun is dodging bullets. However, if I’m Joe Marinelli, I’m sweating it out and wondering — will this weekend bring the one shooting that earns Savavnnah the same kind of screaming headlines in newspapers that Florida got in 1993? Like “Once again Florida: German tourist chased and murdered,” after the fourth German tourist was murdered in six months, and “Deathtrap Under the Palms.” These headlines sent a shockwave through the Sunshine State’s $30 billion a year tourism economy.\nOne report I’ve been hearing from friends and others who are downtown on weekend evenings is an increase in “rough” crowds in the City Market area — once known for attracting an older, more sedate crowd. I’m also hearing from other friends and acquaintances that they don’t feel as safe as they used to feel when headed to this area, which is apparently becoming a fall-back zone for the urban hip-hop crowd that used to frequent Frozen Paradise, a nightspot a few blocks closer to the river that stays open until 3 a.m. The club moved to Indian Street from Broughton Street, where it had been a giant pain in the rears of residents, businesses and police at closing time because of the noise, traffic and rowdy behavior of departing patrons. You change the mix in any crowd, especially one that’s liquored up, and you change the vibe, which can make an area less appealing and more risky. A song from Creedence Clearwater Revival describes these feelings and offers sound advice:\n“I see the bad moon arising.\n“I see trouble on the way.\n“I see earthquakes and lightnin’. See those bad times today.\n“Don’t go around tonight,\n“Well it’s bound to take your life, There’s a bad moon on the rise.”\nA bad moon on the rise also is a fact of political life for incumbents on Savannah City Council in this year’s city elections on Nov. 3. A combination of voter fear and anger over public safety could cost some of them their seats. But for Frank Wilson, any change is too little, too late.\nTom Barton is the editorial page editor of the Savannah Morning News. tom.barton@savannahnow.com .", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-22T20:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:06:25.275+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
