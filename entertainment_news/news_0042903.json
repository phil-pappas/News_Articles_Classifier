He is a true son of the South and a longtime fan of country music, which is probably why his songs instantly resonated with music fans. His 2008 debut album reached No. 1 country and also yielded three No. 1 country singles. Since then he has won a Grammy Award, released three more country chart-topping albums and scored a half dozen other No. 1 singles.\nRucker’s latest release, “Southern Style,” is the South Carolina native’s attempt to capture what it’s like to live below the Mason-Dixon Line.\n“To me, the South means a laid-back lifestyle, beaches, family and being able to have a good time when you want to,” Rucker said. “In Charleston, where I’m from, nobody’s in a rush to get anywhere. And there’s a mentality that there’s room for everybody. So with these songs, I wanted to bring out the way I live, the way my friends live and all the things that are important to us.”\nRucker used the new studio project as an opportunity to expand his vocal range, which is evident in the album’s lead single, “Homegrown Honey.”\n“I definitely took a bit more chances in my singing,” Rucker said. “I didn’t record everything in that very low key. A few of the songs are up in a higher key, and it was fun hitting those notes.”\nUnlike many country singers, Rucker actually writes his own material. He co-wrote every song on “Southern Style.”\n“I knew that I wanted to do what great country songs do, which was to write and record songs that you just couldn’t deny,” Rucker said. “You never know until after you have the songs, but tracks like ‘High on Life’ started steering us to where we wanted to go. In the end, this might be my country-est record so far, and that really was the first thought.”\nDespite his success as a country artist, Rucker hasn’t completely closed the door on Hootie & the Blowfish. The platinum-selling group that put him on the U.S. musical map in the mid-1990s continues to perform sporadically, including an annual Hootie’s Homegrown Concert in Daniel Island, S.C., every August.\nContact this contributing writer at donaldthrasher8@aol.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:26:55.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
