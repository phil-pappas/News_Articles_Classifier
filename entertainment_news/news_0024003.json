The six MBSU finalists were tasked with the creation of one head-to-toe look inspired by Star Wars. Tonight, with Stormtroopers in tow, José Manuel St-Jacques and Simon Bélange of UNTTLD were crowned the winners - with a commemorative lightsaber, of course - earning a prize of $15,000 to put towards their own collection.\n\"With Star Wars: The Force Awakens launching in December, we know that the force among fans is stronger than ever,\" said Pete Noonan , Managing Director, Licensing, Disney Consumer Products Canada. \"We are delighted to be back at World MasterCard® Fashion Week, supporting up and coming Canadian talent. Star Wars has been a part of pop culture and fashion for many generations, so we loved seeing the designers' interpretations come to life tonight.\"\nStar Wars has a rich design history, having popped up on various runway shows and editorial covers since its inception in 1977. With its memorable characters, unique set design and costumes, both designers and street style fans alike have taken sartorial cues from the film for decades. The six finalists in tonight's competition were asked to design one look inspired by the iconic films that have attracted generations of fans. Each designer was instructed to design one head-to-toe look for spring/summer 2016 based on the design elements of the film.\nRoger Christian , Academy Award® winner and set decorator, was onsite for the festivities, acting as a guest judge for the evening. As the original creator of the iconic lightsaber and the character, R2D2, Christian's long history with the franchise brought an authentic creative eye to the panel.\n\"We are proud to have Roger on the judging panel to lend his credible design history and sensibility to the competition this year,\" said Noonan. \"Roger has been an integral part of the series from the very beginning, so it's very special to have him join us tonight.\"\nFollowing tonight's event, the six looks will be displayed in the fashion environment as part of a Star Wars themed installation for the duration of the week. Guests can get in on the fun by following the hashtag #StarWarsFashion and @StarWarsStyle .\nTo access photos from the tonight's presentation, visit www.wireimage.com .\nAbout Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media\nDisney Consumer Products and Interactive Media (DCPI) is the business segment of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) that brings our company's stories and characters to life through innovative and engaging physical products and digital experiences across more than 100 categories, from toys and t-shirts, to apps, books and console games.
