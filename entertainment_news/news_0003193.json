Here is our decidedly personal, even idiosyncratic ranking of all the men who have played 007 — both in the official franchise and in rogue productions. Defying conventional logic, the first or most famous is not necessarily the best:\n• DANIEL CRAIG\nRanking: 1st\nNationality/Birthplace: British: born in Chester, Cheshire, England\nAge while playing 007: 38-47\nTimes playing 007: 4\nCurrent status: Waiting for release of Spectre, seven months after turning 47\nWhen Daniel Craig was first named the new James Bond in 2005 — before making his 2006 debut with Casino Royale — purists damned him for his limited star power, perceived blandness and even his sandy hair colour and modest height (five-foot-10 or 178 cm). Ha! Craig now defines and owns the role, even though he is the first Bond born after the 007 franchise launched, and also the first born after spy-savvy British author Ian Fleming died in 1964. Craig brought a dangerous edge back to Bond; he embodied the MI6 agent’s solid physicality; he balanced Fleming’s original perception of Bond as “a blunt instrument” with a modern audience’s desire for a flawed yet inspirational hero; and he knew how to plumb the moral murk of Bond’s job as a self-doubting assassin. Craig’s best Bond remains Martin Campbell’s Casino Royale, while Marc Forster’s Quantum of Solace is good (if perplexing to many) while Sam Mendes’ Skyfall ranks as his spectacular number two. Spectre, with Mendes back as director, debuts worldwide on Nov. 6 after opening earlier in Britain.\n• SEAN CONNERY\nRanking: 2nd\nNationality/Birthplace: British: born in Edinburgh, Scotland\nAge when playing 007: 32-37, reprised role at 41, again at 53\nTimes playing 007: 7\nCurrent Status: Now retired, 85 years old\nThe gruff, even curmudgeonly Sean Connery was perfect as the “original” and official James Bond in Dr. No. Somewhat reluctantly at times, Connery did the initial run of five Bonds from Dr. No through You Only Live Twice, returned for Diamonds Are Forever in 1971 and then went rogue with Never Say Never Again in 1983. That final go-round was a remake of Thunderball, an official Bond from 1965. But the rights were owned independently by Irish producer Kevin McClory, who had collaborated with Fleming before entering years of tiresome litigation. Connery’s best Bond is Goldfinger (1964) with its breathtaking action, wicked humour, super-sexy Bond Girl (Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore) and legendary villains in Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe) and Oddjob (Harold Sakata). Connery reached his zenith as Bond by pushing the boundaries of acceptable behaviour — and by giving the movie a real sense of violence and even brutality. Connery’s worst Bond is Never Say Never Again, because he seemed disinterested.\n• PIERCE BROSNAN\nRanking: 3rd\nNationality/Birthplace: Irish and American (dual citizen): born in Drogheda, County Louth, Ireland\nAge when playing 007: 41-49\nTimes playing 007: 4\nCurrent status: Still producing films and acting at 62\nAfter a tortuous Bond hiatus following Timothy Dalton’s dark era — and eight years after he missed out on the role because of his rigid Remington Steele contract — Pierce Brosnan revived the franchise with GoldenEye (1995). He brought back the sleek charm of the character, something that Roger Moore had instilled and Timothy Dalton had abandoned. Brosnan did it with more edge than Moore, while also introducing vulnerability into the Bond persona and stripping out the misogyny. Brosnan’s best Bond is his debut, Martin Campbell’s GoldenEye, not least because Famke Janssen dazzled as a Bond Girl, Xenia Onatopp. Brosnan’s worst was his farewell turn in Lee Tamahori’s effects-heavy Die Another Day, a film that betrayed how desperately 007 scripts needed a boost again.\n• ROGER MOORE\nRanking: 4th\nNationality/Birthplace: British: born in London, England\nAge when playing 007: 45-57\nTimes playing 007: 7\nCurrent status: Now retired, 87 years old\nIt is no coincidence that Roger Moore is a goodwill ambassador for UNICEF. He spreads good will, even on screen. Moore once told me that he was never much of an accomplished actor, but he did know how to infuse his roles with natural charm, whether it was as James Bond or as Simon Templar in TV’s The Saint. Because Moore never threatened as Bond, the franchise got soft and the plots gimmicky during his tenure. For John Glen’s Octopussy — released the same year as Connery’s second Bond comeback picture, Never Say Never Again — I visited the set and got to see how Moore suavely floated through the work. Moore remains likeable today, but ranks as a lightweight 007. His best Bond picture is Live and Let Die, while his worst is that ridiculous Moonraker debacle.\n• TIMOTHY DALTON\nRanking: 5th\nNationality/Birthplace: British: born in Colwyn Bay, Denbighshire, Wales\nAge when playing 007: 43-45 (or 41-43, depending on actual birth year)\nTimes playing 007: 2\nCurrent status: Still acting occasionally at 71 (or 69, because records show he was born either in 1944 or 1946)\nWelshman Timothy Dalton was a downer playing Bond in The Living Daylights (1987) and Licence to Kill (1989). But he may also been ahead of his time, because some of the tonal shift in these two Bonds eventually influenced Craig’s portrayal. Dalton emphasized gritty realism — something Craig revived in Casino Royale. But Dalton’s plodding style also damaged the brand, especially when the franchise’s producers seemed unsure of what path to follow. The Living Daylights remains the better of Dalton’s two Bonds.\n• GEORGE LAZENBY\nRanking: 6th\nNationality/Birthplace: Australian: born in Goulburn, New South Wales\nAge when playing 007: 30\nTimes playing 007: 1\nCurrent status: Still acting occasionally at 76\nAs I found out recently meeting new friends from Down Under, it takes little to get Australians into action defending Lazenby as 007 and extolling the virtues of his only Bond picture, On Her Majesty’s Secret Service (1969). With good reason! The film has a still growing cult status today. But Lazenby ruined his own chances for a lasting legacy by publicly feuding with his producers, prompting his Secret Service co-star Diana Rigg to call him both foolish and egotistical: “I can no longer cater for his obsession with himself. He is utterly, unbelievably ... bloody impossible.” Nevertheless, the movie is clever, fast-paced and featured Telly Savalas as leader of the criminal syndicate SPECTRE, which Craig will deal with in the new Bond.\n• BARRY NELSON\nRanking: 7th\nNationality/Birthplace: American: born in San Francisco, California\nAge when playing 007: 37\nTimes playing 007: 1\nCurrent status: Died in 2007 at 89\nEnglish author and one-time spy Ian Fleming sold the rights to his first James Bond novel, Casino Royale (1952) to CBS-TV in the U.S. for a mere pittance — $1,000. CBS staged Casino Royale as a 48-minute dramatic-thriller and broadcast it Oct. 21, 1954, as the third episode of its anthology series, Climax! That meant that the world’s most famous British agent was first played by an American, Barry Nelson. The role of the villain, Le Chiffre, attracted a more intriguing actor, Peter Lorre, who inspired Nelson to take his “unknown” role as James (Jimmy) Bond. Despite Lorre, this version of Casino Royale is a clumsy operation with cheap sets. The chubby-cheeked Nelson is undistinguished in the starring role. The original Climax! is available in a rough B&W video (which was rescued from an old kinescope). It can be found among extras on a DVD of the 1967 version of Casino Royale.\n• DAVID NIVEN\nRanking: 8th ... and last!\nBirthplace/Nationality: Caswell, Oxfordshire — English\nAge when playing 007: 57\nTimes playing 007: 1\nCurrent status: Died in 1983 at 73\nDavid Niven was one of the most smooth and accomplished actors of his generation. But his Bond was a disaster (no fault of his own). The 1967 version of Casino Royale was a one-off, separate from the “official” series because of rights issues dating back to the 1950s and CBS. Set up as a spy movie satire, this silly comedy stars Niven as a James Bond obliged to come out of retirement in a crisis. Meanwhile, six others pretend to be Bond to confuse the enemy (and the audience). The fakes include Peter Sellers, a comedy genius wasted here, and Ursula Andress, the first “official” Bond girl as Honey Ryder in Dr. No (1962). Thankfully for Fleming’s legacy, the rights to Casino Royale were eventually bought up by Eon Productions for its “official” series — and Craig’s debut in the role.\nTwitter: @Bruce_Kirkland\nbruce.kirkland@sunmedia.ca\nWho is your favourite 007?
