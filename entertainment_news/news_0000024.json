(Photo: Lisa Tomaestti, Sony Pictures Classics)\nCONNECT 12 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Landmark moments in American journalism are dominating cinema this fall. First up is Truth (opens Friday in New York and Los Angeles, expands nationwide Oct. 30), a story that digs into Dan Rather's legacy, starring Robert Redford as the CBS anchor and Cate Blanchett as his longtime producer Mary Mapes. Stars such as Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams go into the trenches in Spotlight (Nov. 6), which puts viewers in step with Boston Globe journalists as they break their massive investigation into the Catholic Church pedophilia scandal. USA TODAY stacks the two big screen tales up.\n'TRUTH'\nThe big story: Truth focuses on events preceding Rather's final CBS sign-off in 2005, spurred by his controversial 60 Minutes II report questioning George W. Bush's pre-Vietnam service in the Texas Air National Guard. When documents that verified Bush's absence were discredited, Rather's contract wasn't renewed and Mapes was fired. Rather, who has defended the thrust of the report, accused the network of caving in to the White House, and in 2007, he sued CBS and parent company Viacom. The suit was dismissed.\nTrickiest element to navigate:\n\"They know what he looks like, what he sounds like,\" says Redford, who watched Rather's newscasts to prepare. \"I had to be careful not to do a caricature but get the essence.\" Director James Vanderbilt (the screenwriter behind Zodiac ) decided to forgo prosthetics and simply grayed Redford's hair. \"We didn't set out to restore Dan's legacy,\" says Vanderbilt. \"This was a guy who was at CBS News for 40 years. If ( Truth ) is having any kind of impact, it's because people are reminded of the breadth of this man's work.\"\nUSA TODAY\nRedford takes on Rather's legacy in 'Truth'\nHow they did it: Vanderbilt came across an excerpt of Mapes' book, Truth and Duty: The Press, The President and the Privilege of Power , in Vanity Fair . \"I was really taken with it,\" he says. \"I've always been passionate about journalism.\" But Mapes was hesitant to sell the movie rights. \"I had to talk Mary into it,\" he says. \"She was still sort of in a defensive crouch from what had happened.\"\nInside the newsroom: Vanderbilt brings the audience into the urgency with which 60 Minutes builds sensitive reports — this particular story had to go in September to avoid an \"October surprise\" (aka a news event that could sway voters right before the November election). In Truth , \"the title is about what everyone is trying to get to,\" says Vanderbilt. \"How the sausage is made, how our news stories are baked, prepared and served to us.\"\nAdvice from the real journos: \"It was an unbreakable loyalty,\" the actor recalls Rather telling him. \"The shock and despair (was) when they broke that loyalty.\"\nWhat the critics are saying: Industry experts are eying Blanchett as a possible Oscar nominee. \"Blanchett gives this dynamo of intelligence and doggedness a real human dimension that allows the propulsive drama to breathe,\" The Hollywood Reporter wrote. \"It's another stellar performance that rates among her best.\"\nMichael Keaton (left) and Mark Ruffalo star as 'Boston Globe' journalists in 'Spotlight.' (Photo: Kerry Hayes)\n'SPOTLIGHT'\nThe big story: Spotlight dives headfirst into the Pulitzer Prize-winning investigation by The Boston Globe's Spotlight team as they uncover a systematic cover-up by the Catholic Church to protect abusive priests. To date, the church has spent more than $3 billion addressing the crisis, and weeks ago in Philadelphia, Pope Francis met with five victims, saying \"God weeps\" for them.\nTrickiest element to navigate: Sifting through binders stuffed with hundreds of articles about the scandal published by the Globe . \"Basically, we spent a lot of time investigating the investigation,\" says director Tom McCarthy.\nUSA TODAY\n'Spotlight' gets big awards buzz at TIFF\nHow they did it: The movie doesn't depict what happened behind clergy doors with children. \"Our approach was through the reporters' experience,\" the director says. The challenge was transporting the audience back to a time before there was knowledge of the abuse. Inside the Globe , \"there was not a naiveté toward the church, but no one had any idea of the scope of the crime,\" an investigation that began with a dozen abusive priests and ballooned to 90 in the Boston area alone.\nMichael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams and Liev Schreiber star in the trailer for 'Spotlight.' Open Road Films\nAdvice from the real journos: A host of personalities are juggled in Spotlight , including no-nonsense new editor-in-chief Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber); Ben Bradlee Jr. (John Slattery), the deputy managing editor initially wary of the investigation; protective Spotlight editor (Michael Keaton); and his gaggle of intrepid reporters (Ruffalo, McAdams and Brian d'Arcy James). \"There's a particular kind of culture that develops over time\" in a newsroom, says McCarthy, based on an evolving mass of \"sharing, privacy, ego and randomness.\"\nInside the newsroom: Spotlight literally invaded the Globe 's morning news meeting. The goal? \"Let's pass their litmus test.\" Three weeks before production, \"we sat with the reporters and went line by line, scene by scene\" for accuracy, McCarthy says. \"That was really helpful.\"\nWhat the critics are saying: Variety puts Spotlight in the mold of \"slow-building, quietly gripping journalistic procedurals\" such as All the President's Men. Deadline reports \"many pundits are already declaring Spotlight a best picture front-runner.\"\nCONNECT 12 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT //usat.ly/1LsPiL5 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4551126207001_video-still-for-video-4550963799001.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/09/29906170001_4485437629001_4485392137001-vs.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/09/29906170001_4485437630001_4485392137001-th.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LsPiL5&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4251d33cea40ac6c571b80946b9a901360e5eb37/c=204-0-3396-2400&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/635802622092407569-spotlight-S-09159-rgb.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/09/29906170001_4485437629001_4485392137001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LsPiL5&text=Journalists%20get%20star%20treatment%20in%20%27Truth%2C%27%20%27Spotlight%27&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34f3c12e46e775b6bc7e523d797ba40d553715a7/r=540&c=540x304/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/09/29906170001_4485437629001_4485392137001-vs.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1RFje7C", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0145d001cec4c1e9fb2254a3db957d2c05c56a20/c=163-340-3649-3826/local/-/media/2015/08/30/USATODAY/USATODAY/635765491088333504-XXX-TRUTH-MOV-DCB-75419012.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3fee3fe89e3ac48dc022f2983faae1b26822a734/r=500x355/local/-/media/2015/10/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/635802616272634263-XXX-THETRUTH-MOV-DCB-74910274-1-.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a6f8fa4951d9b3733add01ba38d65d68c4e7574d/c=422-0-2473-2051/local/-/media/2015/09/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635778739956488068-GTY-488224520-75897512.JPG", "http://usat.ly/1LsPiL5", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4551126207001_video-still-for-video-4550963799001.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://usat.ly/1LsAThT", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4551126206001_thumbnail-for-video-4550963799001.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/635802616272634263-XXX-THETRUTH-MOV-DCB-74910274-1-.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3dcfcec2fcf856e86e721ffec47c306613134949/c=144-0-5242-3833&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/635802616272634263-XXX-THETRUTH-MOV-DCB-74910274-1-.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34f3c12e46e775b6bc7e523d797ba40d553715a7/r=540&c=540x304/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4551126207001_video-still-for-video-4550963799001.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T00:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:52:52.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
