Now, with a Telugu film in the offing and with her currently shooting for an untitled multi-lingual thriller, she is set to make her Tamil debut too. Harshika tells us about the challenges the film industry has put forth before she could make headway.\nIs branching out of the Kannada film industry to work on films in other languages the only way for a south actress to make a mark today? I don't think actresses here can be blamed if they work towards making a mark elsewhere. We move out because, at times, filmmakers here fail to see the potential in local, Kannadiga actresses. See the number of films that are being made here each year â€” most of them have heroines from various other states. This, even when there are so many talented local actresses right here. I have often heard people say that heroines from here are not on par with, say, heroines from Bollywood or other south industries. They say we don't look glamourous enough or are not bold enough. But that is not true. Actresses here can transform to play any role and I am not speaking for myself when I say that. Take a look at the many actresses from here that have gone on to make a mark in other languages. It is unfortunate that makers tend to notice potential only when an actress has ventured out and proven herself.\nTell us about the multi-lingual thriller you are shooting for... I have been shooting right through the nights for this film at a huge house on the outskirts of Bengaluru for the last one month. It is a thriller, directed by Venugopal,which is being made in four south languages simultaneously. So the cast for all are on the set together as we are required to shoot our scenes one after the other. While it is being made in Kannada too, I am not part of the Kannada version. This will mark my Tamil debut instead, in which I star opposite Mahat Raghavendra.\nDo you find yourself facing language issues when it comes to such projects? Going to a school where you have friends who speak so many different languages is a huge advantage. I can speak most south Indian language fluently. While I dub for all my Kannada films, it is up to the director to decide if my Tamil is fluent enough for me to dub. Though, dubbing for your own films does give you an advantage, in terms of portraying your character to the fullest, as well as when you are being considered for State awards. There are not many actresses in the Kannada film industry who can dub for themselves. I am part of three Kannada films that are being shot in the coming year, and I will, of course, dub for all these films myself.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:22:57.923+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
