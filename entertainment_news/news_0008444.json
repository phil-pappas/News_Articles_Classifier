Market liberalization, economic pressures, and environmental regulations are all moving utilities toward a path of fewer traditional central power plants and more distributed energy resources (DER) to address future needs. DR can help speed this transition and make the grid more reliable along the way.\n\nUtilities have run residential direct load control (DLC) programs as forms of demand management and offered interruptible rates to commercial and industrial (C&I) customers for many years. However, today's consumers expect more help from technology and demand more flexibility in their operations. DR is starting to experience growth outside of North America , and expansion into other regions is expected to increase in the near future. Numerous countries in Europe are opening up energy markets to DR resources, and as smart meters are rolled out across the continent, the potential for DR improves. In Asia Pacific , countries like Australia , New Zealand , and South Korea have active DR programs. Meanwhile, Japan and China are piloting DR projects and expect to expand DR's role in their markets in the next few years. According to Navigant Research, the global DR market is expected to grow from $2.0 billion in 2015 to over $12.8 billion by 2023.\n\nThis Navigant Research Leaderboard Report examines the strategy and execution of 13 leading DR providers. These DR players are rated on 10 criteria: vision, go-to-market strategy, partners, technology, geographic reach, sales, marketing, and distribution, product performance, product portfolio, pricing, and staying power. Using Navigant Research's proprietary Leaderboard methodology, vendors are profiled, rated, and ranked with the goal of providing industry participants with an objective assessment of these companies' relative strengths and weaknesses in the global C&I and residential DR markets.\n\nTop 10 Vendors: \n1.
