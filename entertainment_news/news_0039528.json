(WKBW) - Cory Wells, one of the lead singers of Three Dog Night, has died. He was 74. \nWells, pictured here on the far left with the other members of his band, died unexpectedly Tuesday at his home in Dunkirk. \nBeginning in September, the band postponed several shows, saying Wells needed continued treatment for a nerve problem in his back that caused severe pain. \nThere is no word on his cause of death or if the medical issue Wells was dealing with played any role. \nWells was an original member of Three Dog Night. Bandmate Danny Hutton said, \"Cory was like a brother in so many ways. We had been together since 1965 and I am in shock at this sudden loss.\" \nWells was born Emil Lewandowski in Buffalo on February 2, 1941 to a single mother. According to a biography posted on the band's website, he joined the U.S. Air Force out of high school. After his service ended, he returned to Buffalo and played in several bands before moving to California. \nWells, an avid fisherman, returned to Western New York to enjoy the natural beauty of the Great Lakes. \nHe is survived by Mary, his wife of 50 years, daughter Coryann and Dawn Marie, and give grandchildren.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:27:04.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
