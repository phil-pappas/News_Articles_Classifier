The party-goers could choose from three different music channels, dancing to their own rhythms. \nDancer Clementine Schal said she sees the station \"differently now.\" It's normally used for Eurostar trains to London and trains to other points around France and Europe. \nIn a reference to U.N. climate talks that Paris is hosting in December, City Hall hosted an all-night exhibit of 270 colorful blocks representing melting ice. About 130 events were held throughout the city. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
