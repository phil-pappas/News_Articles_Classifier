The performance of horsemanship and showmanship comes for two shows, in Providence and South Kingstown. Comment Posted Oct. 1, 2015 at 12:01 AM By Richard Duckett Posted Oct. 1, 2015 at 12:01 AM There's a saying, \"Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.\" For Rene Gasser, who purchases horses from some of the most prestigious and famous breeds in the world — Andalusian, Friesian, Lipizzaner and Arabian — it's vital that he look a horse in the eyes. \"I like to see before anything else — I like to see their eyes. If they have a nice relaxed eye,\" Gasser said. \"I like to get a feel when you meet a horse: 'This horse has got something special.' You get a feeling. I trust the instinct. Sometimes you can have a horse so good looking, but if you don't know [how you feel], stay away from it.\" Gasser has looked into the eyes of all 14 stallions that are traveling with him as his show, \"The Gala of the Royal Horses,\" tours the United States for the first time, with several New England dates, including Sunday at 4 p.m. at the Dunkin' Donuts Center and Thursday, Oct. 8, at 7 p.m. at the Ryan Center at URI. Originally from Switzerland, Gasser now lives and maintains his stables in Melbourne, Australia. His family line is highlighted by a history of both horsemanship and showmanship over seven generations, and those elements will be seen in \"The Gala of the Royal Horses.\" \"It's not just watching dressage, it's watching a show,\" Gasser said during a recent telephone interview, his accent an interesting mix of Continental Europe with some Aussie twang. The stars of the show are the horses, who can do the deftest and most graceful foot maneuvers or gallop at a breathtaking clip around an indoor arena (sometimes two together with one rider standing astride both horses). In addition, \"The Gala of the Royal Horses\" has riders (including Gasser) as well as musicians and dancers. The show's accent is sometimes very Spanish, with Spanish guitar (which can bring a horse to stand on its hind legs) and costumed flamenco dance. In one segment, a horse does the same steps as a flamenco dancer, Gasser said. Gasser is the show's \"riding master\" as well as producer. \"I'm in [the show] the whole time. If I'm not riding, I'm watching, seeing everything is running smoothly.\" The horses have lineages that go back to the old royal families of Europe, who bred them for their beauty, ability and disposition. Kings posed proudly with their horses for portraits and took them to the battlefield. As for Gasser's lineage, his great-grandmother was an accomplished horse trainer and performer, and his great-grandfather was a highly decorated military horseman. \"We've been doing this forever,\" he said of his family's involvement with horses. The family also put on circuses in Europe, and then when Gasser was growing up, they went further afield, including to Australia, where the family bought some property and ran a circus (with some horse acts, of course). Page 2 of 2 - Australia, like North America, does not readily provide people many opportunities to see the royal horses of Europe in a performance setting. With that in mind, Gasser started coming up with ideas for a royal horse gala. \"It's like taking people through Europe seeing the horses,\" Gasser said. \"I'm sure it's a lot more fun than going to war.\" Gasser is married with two children, and the family tradition looks fairly likely to continue. \"You can't make somebody do something. It's in their blood or not. My daughter's very much into it . My son I'm kind of winning over. He's more into computers and motor bikes.\" Which sounded to be just fine with Gasser, who comes across as having a very amiable and amusing disposition. Gasser has bred horses, including a white Lipizzaner named Mozart who is part of the performing cast. But more typically he travels extensively to find horses that he will train. \"I don't like breeding when I'm not there myself. Really, it's hard work,\" he said. \"We've got good connections all over Europe. People give us a phone call. It gives us a good excuse to look at horses and have some good food and wine. Mix it up a bit. I'm able to pick from hundreds of horses. It makes life more interesting. You're getting from a network of people probably something that would take you years to find.\" On the other hand, \"To pick the right horses, it's quite an art.\" But the fact that these horses have been bred for qualities that include temperament means he's off to a good start. \"Normal horses, they would probably flip out. It's one thing to do dressage, another to be in an arena with 10,000 people, lights,\" Gasser said. \"These particular breeds, they can handle things much better than the average horse.\" \"The Gala of the Royal Horses\" will be at the Dunkin Donuts Center, Providence, Sunday, Oct. 4, at 4 p.m.; and at the Ryan Center, Kingston, Thursday, Oct. 8, at 7 p.m. By Richard Duckett", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T17:04:59.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
