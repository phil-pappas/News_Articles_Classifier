Peppler fired 10 rounds at Gomez, hitting him once in the thumb.\nThe settlement led to dismissal of Gomez’s lawsuit by a federal judge on Sept. 29, according to court records.\nGomez was not armed with a weapon, but deputies had seen him reach down inside his car during the chase and reach toward his waistband several times before Peppler fired a bullet that went through Gomez’s lip and lodged in his spinal cord, leaving him paralyzed, according to a San Bernardino County District Attorney’s Office review.\nThe review issued in February 2013 found the deputies’ actions and use of force “reasonable and necessary based on the facts presented.” Throughout the pursuit, “Gomez continually put the lives of citizens in danger” by using his vehicle to escape and ignoring deputy commands to put his hands up, leading Peppler to believe that lives were in “imminent danger.”\nGomez filed a lawsuit in San Bernardino County Superior Court and in November 2013 it was transferred to U.S. District Court, which has jurisdiction over claims made in the lawsuit. The settlement, on behalf of the county and Peppler, was presented to the county Board of Supervisors for approval in July, and details were worked out over the next few weeks.\nThe original complaint named another deputy as a defendant, but the plaintiff’s attorneys dismissed the case against him in May.\nThe lawsuit alleged denial of medical care and that “the shooting was entirely unjustified and constituted unreasonable and excessive use of force.”\nIn his lawsuit, Gomez stated he was “unarmed and posed no threat to police officers or to the public.” He shouted at the officer not to shoot because children were inside the duplex. Gomez lost use of his legs and most use of his arms and requires “lifetime support and assistance,” according to the lawsuit.\nGomez was charged with three counts of assault with a deadly weapon on a peace officer likely to cause great bodily injury and one count of evading a peace office with wanton disregard for safety. On Dec. 31, a Superior Court jury found Gomez guilty of evading and not guilty of the other charges. He is scheduled to be sentenced Nov. 6.\nContact the writer: 951-368-9075 or gwesson@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvxj53-b88535620z.120151008183447000gvtcg09l.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvxj53-b88535620z.120151008183447000gvtcg09l.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:07:43.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
