It was the highlight of my career.\"\nGross was among the American Airlines employees -- pilots, flight attendants, security officials, technicians and more -- who were hand-picked from the Fort Worth-based company's nationwide employee base to work on this flight. They were all vetted by the U.S. Secret Service.\nOn the plane chartered by the U.S. Conference of Bishops, they took the pope from the Joint Base Andrews in Maryland to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York then to Philadelphia and finally to Rome.\nCaptain George Griffin, a 53-year-old pilot from Flower Mound, was the lead captain on the trip.\nHe said he personally greeted Pope Francis -- whose busy trip included meeting President Barack Obama, speaking to Congress and the U.N., celebrating masses, feeding the homeless, meeting prison inmates and more -- every time he boarded the plane.\nThe two had a few opportunities to spend a few minutes together, which meant a lot to Griffin, who is Catholic.\nAt one point, Griffin presented a gift from American Airlines to the pope. But he can't disclose what the gift was.\nAs the plane was headed to Philadelphia, Griffin said he asked Pope Francis to bless his landing.\nPope Francis said he would, and in return he asked Griffin to pray for him so he would do well in Philadelphia.\nLater in the trip, Griffin asked the pope to bless him and his family, as well as some crosses and rosaries he had with him.\nPope Francis obliged and Griffin said there really are no words to describe the experience.\n\"When you are in the presence of the pope, ... it's a very powerful feeling,\" he said. \"I felt very blessed.\"\nTom Howard is among those who helped plan the trip.\nThe North Richland Hills man said work on setting up the flight began back in January after American Airlines was the airline chosen for the journey.\nArrangements included picking an aircraft, flight crews, maintenance crews and more -- and making sure everything and everyone received federal clearance to be on the flight.\n\"Pope Francis didn't want any type of special services,\" said Howard, 59, an Integrated Operations Center dispatch tech specialist who was among those on the flight. \"He wanted everyone on the plane to have the same services.\"\nBut everything took time.\nJust getting approval for the plane to be called \"Shepherd One\" -- the traditional call sign given to an aircraft carrying the pope -- took months and created mountains of paperwork.\nOnly a few temporary alterations were made to the plane for the trip.\nVatican City flags and the papal seal were added to the aircraft to formally make it the \"papal\" airplane. And some curtains taken off a different plane were added to the first class area where the pope sat.\n\"The Holy Father didn't want any modifications to the plane that would cost extra money,\" Howard said.\nHoward said at one point, he did ask Pope Francis to bless the plane and he obliged.\n\"I couldn't hear what he was saying, ... but he did the sign of the cross.\"\nHoward, who is Catholic and has nine brothers and sisters, brought a bag of items -- including rosaries, crosses and books -- that he asked the pope to bless.\nThe pope agreed to bless the bag and the items in it.\n\"'But now you have to do one thing for me,'\" Howard recalled the pope saying to him. \"'Pray for me.'\"\nThat moment, and the whole trip, Howard said, was inspiring and nearly overwhelming.\n\"It's indescribable,\" he said.\nNow Howard said he is focusing on his next assignment: Booking charter flights for the Texas Rangers baseball team to take to their playoff games.\nUnfortunately, he said he can't book the team on the already-blessed Boeing 777-200 that was used to fly the pope.\nThat plane is bigger than what the Texas Rangers need -- and it's already back in service (with the papal seal and flags removed) -- as a regular passenger plane.\nBut Howard said he hopes the plane he will pick for the Rangers will bring them luck nonetheless.\n\"Hopefully, we will be bringing them back ... with the trophy.\"\n(c)2015 Fort Worth Star-Telegram\nVisit the Fort Worth Star-Telegram at www.star-telegram.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/healthandspirit/religion/religiousnews/s-1734109", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/healthandspirit/religion/religiousnews/s-1734109&h=American+Airlines+crew+talks+about+once+in+a+lifetime+flight+with+Pope+Francis", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/healthandspirit/religion/religiousnews/s-1734109&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:10:23.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
