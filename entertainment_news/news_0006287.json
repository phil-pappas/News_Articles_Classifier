Besides the surf and the sand, Causey enjoyed the ride to the beach. His mother had bought a new red 1953 Aston Martin DB2 and used it to haul Causey and his sister to the seashore.\n\"It was a 40th birthday present to herself,\" Causey said. \"My sister was older so she got to sit up front.\"\nYoung Causey would squeeze behind the front seats, which is also where his mother put groceries during weekly errand runs. When he turned 21, Causey was finally allowed to drive the well-loved Aston. It was a big deal as his mom was the sole driver and she didn't turn the keys loose often.\nCausey's father was rarely behind the steering wheel or even found riding along in the passenger seat. \"He was very tall and didn't like his knees knocking against the dashboard,\" said Causey.\nBefore passing away, his mother passed her prized DB2, which was in the middle of a restoration, off to Causey, who now lives in downstate Philo.\nIn addition to preserving the family heirloom, Causey wanted a second vintage Aston that was a bit \"updated\" and something he could drive more regularly. He found that and more in his 1964 DB4.\nCausey purchased the Aston Martin from its second owner in Pittsburg in 2000. The odometer read 62,000 miles. The vehicle had been sold new at Imperial Motors in northern Illinois before going with its first owner to St. Louis.\nOther than the wonderfully patinaed blue paint color, applied prior to Causey's ownership, the Aston is all original. Causey had the 3.7-liter engine and drivetrain overhauled in 2002.\nDespite the DB4's rare and valuable pedigree, Causey isn't intimated to drive the British classic -- and for more than mere local jaunts. About a week ago he motored to Kalamazoo, Michigan, and then to Lake Forest Sportscars in Lake Forest, for the high-end auto dealer's 20th annual Concours d'Elegance Oct. 4.\nThe head-turning DB4 was a superb addition to the 119-car show field, which included a whole host of other vintage and modern performance sportscars and supercars. Old and new Ferraris and Lamborghinis could readily be found along with such mind-boggling dream machines as a Pagani Huayra, McLaren SLR 722S \"Stealth,\" three McLaren P1s and a Porsche 918 Spyder.\nThe spectacle was open to the public and drew vehicles, spectators and car enthusiasts from around the Midwest.\nâ€¢ Email comments, suggestions to auto@dailyherald.com.\n Autos Avery, Matt Lifestyle", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-13T14:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:03:19.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
