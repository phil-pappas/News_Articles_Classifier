The X Factor Top 11 contestant Jimmy Davis. Channel 7 Cars For Sale \nCOORAN singer Jimmy Davis sparked a debate on The X Factor's judging panel last night. \nThe 22-year-old's mentor Chris Isaak assigned him Michael Jackson's rock ballad Black or White for the reality singing show's decades week. \nWhile all four celebrity judges praised his voice and guitar skills, Guy Sebastian called for Davis to return to the simple acoustic style which made his audition so special. \n\"This is the second week you've had a lot of production around you,\" Sebastian said. \n\"Please get back to the Jimmy that I love.\" \nDannii Minogue also urged the singer to speak up if he wasn't comfortable with the arrangement of his weekly song. \n\"You've got to work it out off stage. You've got to be on board and fully committed,\" she said. \nJames Blunt, though, said the performance was \"hugely ambitious\" and only warned Davis to look after his voice when hitting high notes. \nAs the last judge to speak, Isaak hit back at Sebastian and Minogue, reminding Davis that he is competing against their singers for the public vote and grand prize. \n\"I think it's unfair and there's a certain amount of gamesmanship on behalf of the panel,\" he said. \n\"Never forget when you get a criticism who it's coming from and that they have people competing against you.\" \nDavis, who has ambitions to release his own material and play the Woodford Folk Festival, has been nicknamed the \"ranga rocker\" by his fans. \nOne singer will be eliminated from the show in tonight's live decider. chris isaak", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:18:26.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
