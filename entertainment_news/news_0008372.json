Rough cut (no reporter narration).   \nROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) The director and cast of \"Rock the Kasbah\" walked the red carpet at the film's premiere in New York on Monday (October 19). Bill Murray plays a has-been rock music manager whose fortune changes while on tour in Afghanistan in the movie, taking the time-honored route of using comedy to tackle more serious matters. Murray plays Richie Lanz, whose best years are behind him. When he takes his last client to Afghanistan to perform for U.S. soldiers and gets dumped, a twist of fate sees him meet Pashtun girl Salima Khan with a beautiful voice. They travel across the war-torn country as Lanz tries to help Khan, played by Leem Lubany, fulfill her dream of becoming the first woman to compete on Afghanistan's version of music talent show \"American Idol\". The movie also stars Bruce Willis as a ruthless mercenary and Kate Hudson as a savvy prostitute. \"Rock the Kasbah\" hits U.S. cinemas on Friday.  //reut.rs/1ZTY8rx", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:39:32.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
