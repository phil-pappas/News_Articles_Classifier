Most are in North America.\nGM says if weather stops owners from taking their SUVs to dealers, it will pick up the vehicles for service. It also will arrange rental cars if parts aren't available.\nDealers will replace faulty wiper motor covers that allow some electrical terminals to come in contact with each other. Parts are being shipped and will be used first to fix customer vehicles and those that have been sold.\nThe problem was discovered when a wiper motor overheated at a factory near Lansing, Michigan, where the SUVs are made. The plant's quality manager reported the problem on Sept. 21 through GM's \"Speak up for Safety\" program, and GM began investigating five days later.\nThe company says no fires have happened outside the plant.\nAssociated Press\n Automotive Industry General Motors", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5616852b/turbine/ct-gm-recall-suv-windshield-wipers-20151008"], "published": "2015-10-08T17:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:28:56.122+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
