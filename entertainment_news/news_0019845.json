Recall that Shehyee mentioned “Noli” characters Maria Clara and Crisostomo Ibarra in response to Abra’s hit song “Gayuma.” Early this year, we had one Josie Rizal debuting as character on the popular computer game “Tekken 7,” with some suggesting names like “El Fili Buster Rismo” and “Prayle Piledriver” for her unique moves.\nAdding to the resurgence of interest in Rizal is the Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA), which is re-staging “Noli At Fili Dekada Dos Mil.” Written by acclaimed writer Nicanor Tiongson and directed by Soxie Topacio, “Noli At Fili Dekada Dos Mil” is described as a modern re-imagining of Rizal’s literary masterpieces. Several changes have been made in the story but the lesson is still finding a cure to society’s ills. The most pressing issues of today are tackled including the pork barrel, illegal logging, and bad governance, to name a few.\nIn the play, Ibarra Marasigan (stand in for “Noli’s” Crisostomo Ibarra), as mayor of Maypajo, wanted a total log ban in the Sierra Madre to prevent landslides that killed hundreds following a typhoon. This will sour his relationship with Governor Santiago Santos, Bishop Damaso Villareal and Colonel Salvador Salvatierra (the play’s version of Kapitan Tiago, Padre Damaso, and Padre Salvi, respectively) who will all connive to remove Ibarra from power, even going as far as to have him incarcerated. Ibarra’s childhood friend, Elias, helps him escape after which the former joins the rebels taking on the name Kumander Simoun.\nLucho Ayala surprised Kris Bernal after the show, which the actress described as ‘showing of his feelings’\nKudos to the actors – some of whom even handled dual roles – for making the play interesting and riveting. Lighting was good in that it added to the tension and drama of the story. The scoring is commendable as well. Stage design? Simple but brilliant.\nLucho Ayala, who played Ibarra and Simoun, told Bulletin Entertainment how happy he is over people’s reception to the show. “Overwhelming ’yung pagtanggap, madaming nagkagusto ng performance (ko) and the play itself. Super positive lahat ng nababasa ko (na feedback on the show),” he said to that effect.\nKris Bernal (who played Clarissa) shared how her theater experience changed her outlook on acting. The “Little Nanay” star is grateful to have found a family in PETA.\n“Basta hindi ako busy, basta wala pa akong show, kahit gaano pa kaliit na role ’yan sa play (ay mag-theater ako). The experience is priceless,” she said.\nAlso in the cast are Raul Alfonso, Jojo Atienza, Renante Bustamante, Roi Calilong, Buddy Caramat, Eric de la Cruz, Mikou David, Jess Evardone, Gie Onida, Rhenwyn Gabalonzo, Neomi Gonzales, Joseph Madriaga, Gio Gahol, Nicole Manlulo, Kitsi Pagaspas, Joanne Pamintuan, Jack Yabut, Norbs Portales, Raffy Tejada among many others.\n“Noli At Fili Dekada Dos Mil” will be staged in various schools nationwide.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:09:47.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
