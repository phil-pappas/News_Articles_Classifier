(AP Photo/Jerome Delay) \nOn Wednesday, in their first collection, creative directors Sebastien Meyer and Arnaud Vaillant hoped to attract a new generation of fans. \nAnd it was a great debut — that carefully towed the line between the house's '60s codes (minis, PVC, dropped hems) and a fashion-forward crisp and sporty aesthetic. \nCream cashmere bodysuits (that resembled a retro bathing suit) contrasted nicely with a PVC biker jacket in black, and elsewhere in vivid yellow and silver. And '60s oval-shaped colored minis were balanced with crisp white sporty sweaters.

Very sexy, riffing off the 61-year-old former model's penchant for leopard print. \nCoats in leopard, double breasted coats, open black shirts tied at the midriff and herringbone tweed coats will most likely sell like wildfire. \nAnd a small, chic black sweater had a scooped neckline that was both simple — and sultry by exposing a flash of collarbone.

(AP Photo/Jerome Delay) \nOn Wednesday, all the colors of the rainbow were used in silky sheens in an oversized, double-breasted coat, or, after, on a '20s loose shift dress — riffing off the codes of the house founded in 1925 by the late Marcel Rochas. Giant bows came in burnt sienna, black and white and graced funky trapeze silhouette gowns. Pointy stilettos came with a large tulle puff in colors that each time mirrored hues used in the rest of the outfit. \nRochas has sometimes been compared to couture (or demi-couture) and in Wednesday's show it was clear why — an incredible gathered floor-length gown in pale oyster-white with a dropped hem possessed a ravishing swagger as the model moved. And one blush pink dress was constructed from cut-out bow motifs like a delicate exoskeleton. \nDRIES VAN NOTEN'S RAW GLAMOR A model wears a creation by Rochas for the Spring-Summer 2016 ready-to-wear fashion collection, presented during the Paris Fashion Week in Paris, France, Wednesday, Sept. 30, 2015. (AP Photo/Jerome Delay) \n\"Sophisticated yet raw\" said Antwerp designer Dries Van Noten of his vivid, mix-and-match collection Wednesday that twinned glimmering brocades, tulle, jacquards and satins with denim, vests and exposed conical bras. \nThe designer is known and loved for his sumptuous, yet alternative designs, which have graced fashion-conscious celebrities from Cate Blanchett to Maggie Gyllenhaal. \nThis season, he turned up the glamor stakes, with 1930s hair quiffs, shades and color-rich prints and jacquard that saw voluminous coats and skirts in vermilion red, teal blue, purple, soft umber brown, and beautiful ochre yellow in one dissected, fluttery tulle skirt.

(AP Photo/Jerome Delay) \nThe signature of Van Noten, one of the original Antwerp Six, is his play of contradictions. Here this abounded in droves — like one '70s jacket with big shoulders and lapels twinned with silken pants fastidiously embroidered with birds. \nFOUR PIECE SWEET \nA string quartet greeted guests at the center of Van Noten's warehouse presentation, playing throughout.

(AP Photo/Jerome Delay) \nLike Van Noten himself, it was an offbeat style, with odd, often syncopated rhythms coming from the two violins, viola and cello — led by Romanian Alexander Balanescu. \nThe quartet came to relative fame when covering Kraftwerk, Philip Glass and Michael Nyman and went on to record and perform with David Byrne, Gavin Bryars and the Pet Shop Boys. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T22:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:47:36.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
