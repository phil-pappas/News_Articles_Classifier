For the most part, the films have held up reasonably well - compared to something like say Saw - which is due in large part to the natural performances and unfussy direction drawing you in.\nThe added hook this time is the sporadic use of 3D which, at least in the screening we attended, seemed utterly pointless. Instead of reinventing the wheel the filmmakers have simply refined it. One cool moment towards the final third aside, this is not worth your time or money.\nAnother expansive American gaff is haunted; this time with the best looking couple so far and an added wisecracking sidekick in the form of a sibling. Cameras are set up, spooky things happen, a small child talks to someone who \"isn't there\" blah blah blah.\nThe 3D doesn't work, and while this might be pitched as an extended version of the universe that was actually smartly implemented over the first few, it's essentially the same film. Different characters in too similar a set up fail to make it feel any different.\nAlso, being asked to pay premium cinema prices for this is absolutely ludicrous. The empty city centre cinema where this reviewer attended (it wasn't screened for press) a late afternoon screening will hopefully teach the studio a lesson.\nNot a slight on anyone involved, the acting is fine and the execution same; this franchise is just done now. Also, we're pretty sure the found footage thing goes out the window in the opening minutes.\nThe most shocking thing to cross my mind while watching it? How has all this time passed without another Blair Witch flick?", "external_links": ["http://adserver.adtech.de/?adrawdata/3.0/690.1/2913996/0/1725/noperf=1;cc=2;header=yes;alias=myalias;cookie=yes;adct=204;key=key1+key2;grp="], "published": "2015-10-22T02:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T13:31:23.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
