Yet. But you can mark the day — Oct. 21, 2015 — Doc Brown, Marty and Jennifer traveled to in \"Back to the Future Part II\" with local screenings and other events.\nThe biggest party that's been announced is at the Plaza, which served as the model for Biff Tannen's Pleasure Paradise Casino & Hotel in the movie.\nA collection of DeLoreans, including a replica time machine, will be on display Wednesday, along with replicas of Doc Brown's truck and the Libyan terrorists' bus, under the hotel's dome. The beer garden will host a party from 6 to 11 p.m. that includes an '80s costume contest. M3 Trio will perform '80s covers from 8:30 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. in the Omaha Lounge. And the Party Pit Girls will be dressed in '80s outfits.\nIf you'd rather just see the movie, there are plenty of options for that on Wednesday, too.\nCatch the entire trilogy at 4:30 p.m. at The Orleans, Sam's Town, Santa Fe and South Point and at 5 p.m. at Aliante, Colonnade, Fiesta Henderson, Red Rock, Showcase, Sunset Station, Texas Station and Village Square.\nIf you don't have that kind of time, see \"Part II\" by itself at 7 p.m. at Rainbow. It's also playing throughout the day at the Palms, and Rogue Toys will be outside the theater from 7 to 10 p.m. with \"Back to the Future\" toys.\nContact Christopher Lawrence at clawrence@reviewjournal.com .
