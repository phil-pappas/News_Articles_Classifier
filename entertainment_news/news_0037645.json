These tunes are special to me in many ways. Life experiences have always played a huge part in my writings and they certainly did on this project. You will hear happy, sad, uptempo, moderate, slow, reverent, bluesy, dance and jazzy sounds throughout.\n\"Milford's Old Fiddle\" is a tune I wrote about an old fiddle that I used to play occasionally, years ago, and it was owned by my good friend Milford Lambert. Milford's family gave me his fiddle recently as a gift and I decided to have it restored to playability and recorded this tune as well as nine others, using the old fiddle, on the cd. It's a great old fiddle and I really enjoyed playing it on the cd.\n\"Old New River\" is featured on the new cd as a vocal version. I wrote the music originally and recorded it on my previous cd. Deni McIntyre wrote lyrics and it was sung by Laurelyn Dossett.\n\"Lonesome Fiddler's Waltz\" Is one I hope folks will want to waltz/dance to.\n\"Deadwood\" is an uptempo and eerie sounding tune. While at a family reunion in South Dakota some years ago, my wife and I payed a visit to the town of Deadwood. After learning about it's history, I got inspiration to write this tune.\n\"Mahogany Rock Blues\" is a bouncy bluesy sounding tune. Mahogany Rock is located on the Blueridge Parkway near Sparta, NC and I enjoy the scenery and great hiking trails.\n\"Black Hills Hornpipe\" is a tune inspired by a visit to the Black Hills by my family and I.\n\"Sweet Spot\" is simply about the sweet spot. I love music and being a musician. One will learn over time where the best sound is produced, In a particular instrument, microphone placement and etc.. I enjoy baseball and there is definitely a sweet spot in baseball bats.\n\"Careful Now\" has a bit of jazz and swing in it. I have heard musicians, including myself, say \"Careful Now\", when a particularly exciting part of a tune, solo or song is being performed. That's fun stuff!\n\"We did one cover song, \"Uncle Pen\" and was written by Bill Monroe. I've always liked this song and it features Al Batten on vocals. It was fun to do.\nThe other tunes are all standards. I was inspired to play the hymn, \"Nearer, My God, To Thee\", on the cd, after learning the band on Titanic played this as their final piece as the ship sank.\n\"Leather Britches\", \"I'm A Pilgrim\", \"Blackberry Blossom\" are some of my favorite standards.\n\"Red is the Rose\" is an old Irish standard that I recorded for my mother. She loves roses and the tune.\n release/fiddler-tim-smith-amp-friends-vol2-is-released-to-worldwide-radio-by-triplestrand-productions-414606.php", "external_links": ["http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "http://www.24-7pressrelease.com/press-release/fiddler-tim-smith-amp-friends-vol2-is-released-to-worldwide-radio-by-triplestrand-productions-414606.php"], "published": "2015-10-23T11:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:39:43.733+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
