The kind of films that I'm doing - my last film 'Haider' or 'Shaandaar' now or our next film together, 'Udta Punjab'. After that Alia is doing other films and I'm doing other films and I'm very sad that she's working without me, but it's okay,\" said Shahid at a press conference for the \"Bollywood Britain-Shaandaar\" campaign on Monday.\n\nAfter displaying their sizzling chemistry in \"Shaandaar\", Shahid and Alia will then be seen in Abhishek Chaubey's \"Udta Punjab\" which also stars Kareena Kapoor Khan and Diljit Dosanjh. \n\nBut Shahid will go on to work with Kangana Ranaut in \"Rangoon\" while Alia is working with Sidharth Malhotra and Fawad Khan in \"Kapoor And Sons\" and then will work with Varun Dhawan in \"Shuddhi\" and Shah Rukh Khan in Gauri Shinde's film.\n\nAbout \"Shaandaar\", Shahid said: \"The genre of a quirky love story, romantic comedy in a fairytale-ish world. We perhaps might not get the opportunity to do such a genre for the next 1-2 years.\n\n\"It is the only film we are doing in this genre, that's the reason it is very close to our hearts, and we really want the film to be liked and loved by the people because as actors, we'll do different genres and different kind of films, and different kind of characters. So this is a very important opportunity for us, and I hope it turns out to be the best film that me and her have done in this genre, because after that every person has their own careers.\"\n\nVikas Bahl's \"Shaandaar\" is hitting the screens on October 22.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:12:45.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
