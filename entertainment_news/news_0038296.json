Less than two weeks after dropping the action-packed \"Confident\" visuals , the 23-year-old songstress returned on Thursday, October 22 with an emotional clip for \"Waitin for You\". A far cry from her previous video, which was directed by Robert Rodriguez and features cameo from Michelle Rodriguez , the just-arrived video is quite simple. Likely inspired by the bullying the former Disney star experienced when she's younger, it mostly follows Lovato as she wanders alone around a middle school at night. She dons minimal makeup and a black jacket with the word \"Confident\" written on the back as she looks pretty emotional while belting out every line of the powerful track. Rapper Sirah, who's featured on the song, emerges near the end of the video to deliver her guest verse. \"Waitin for You\" appears on Lovato's \" Confident \" album, which arrived last week and is now aiming for the No. 1 spot on next week's Billboard 200. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:43:09.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
