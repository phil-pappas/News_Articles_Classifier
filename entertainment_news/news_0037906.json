Some of the participants really got into the spirit of the event and came dressed as werewolves. It has been an amazing opening night and we look forward to welcoming many more visitors to The Howl between now and Halloween.\"\nâ€“ Matt Heast, Mead Open Farm Entertainment Bedfordshire", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T18:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:27:53.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
