SBTC Chairman James Lamb asked the NRA to support the SBTC's proposed bill entitled \"Americans Working in Interstate Commerce Protection Act,\" (commonly referred to as \" Mike's Law \" named after an over-the-road truck driver named Michael Boeglin who was murdered and burned in his truck on June 26, 2014), which calls for the creation of a new business carry firearms permitting program for Americans working across state lines. \"We understand the NRA has been asking members of Congress that we have approached not to sponsor the Mike's Law bill and support their national concealed carry reciprocity bill instead. We would respectfully request the NRA reconsider their position as we believe our bill is a stepping-stone to national reciprocity. Whereas the NRA bill could be challenged on 10th Amendment \"states' rights\" grounds, our bill is firmly grounded on the Commerce Clause. Mike's Law also invokes the 14th Amendment's \"equal protection of the laws\" guarantee in that truckers should receive the same right to possess firearms while they sleep in their trucks as the majority of Americans, who sleep in residential buildings,\" SBTC Chairman James Lamb said today.\nLamb's Petition to Congress has been signed by approximately 11,000 Americans so far who are in favor of a business carry permit that allows Americans working between states to carry firearms concealed under Federal authority, in accordance with the government's power to regulate interstate commerce under the United States Constitution.\n\"U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has personally expressed to me he is in support of Mike's Law and even indicated he would sign it into law if elected president. And we believe once Mike's Law is passed and signed into law, the NRA could seek it to be extended to all Americans who \"engage\" in any form of interstate commerce, including as consumers, on 14th Amendment grounds. Mike's Law is the back door to national reciprocity for all Americans,\" Lamb added.\nLamb indicated he hopes on behalf of nearly 9 million Americans who work in the transportation industry, many of whom are NRA members, that the SBTC would hear from the NRA that they have decided to support Mike's Law and stand up for truckers' gun rights.", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5NaWtlc0d1bkxhdy5vcmc=", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2hhbmdlLm9yZy9wL2NvbmdyZXNzLWFuZC10aGUtcHJlc2lkZW50LW9mLXRoZS11bml0ZWQtc3RhdGVzLW9mLWFtZXJpY2EtcGFzcy1lbmFibGluZy1sZWdpc2xhdGlvbi1kaXJlY3RpbmctYXRmLXRvLWRldmVsb3AtYS1mZWRlcmFsLWZpcmVhcm1zLWJ1c2luZXNzLWNhcnJ5LXBlcm1pdC10aGF0LWVuYWJsZXMtY2l0aXplbnMtZW5nYWdlZC1pbi1pbnRlcnN0YXRlLWNvbW1lcmNlLXRvLWNhcnJ5LWNvbmNlYWxlZC13ZWFwb25zLXRocm91Z2gtZXZlcnktc3RhdGU="], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:02:39.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
