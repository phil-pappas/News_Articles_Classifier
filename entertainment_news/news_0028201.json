We're just taking a rest for a bit - going on holiday, chilling out for a bit. Do a few different things. We'll be back, don't worry.\" \nWhilst the 23-year-old singer added to STV Glasgow: \"I think we're gonna go on a lads holiday, aren't we lad? That's about all we've got planned at this stage.\" \nMeanwhile, the 'Night Changes' hitmakers have been linked to several different possible careers since announcing their extended break but Harry has joked he's got his sights on becoming an estate agent. \nHe said: \"I'll go from singer to estate agent. I like the little ones [houses] because then you can throw in 'it's romantic', which means it's tiny, while 'it's cute' means too small. It's got 'nice bones' means that it's terrible, and 'nice view' means it has a window.\" \nWhen asked what he would like to do with their time off, Niall joked about \"raving it up\" as a DJ whilst Liam claims his career adviser encouraged him into firefighting. \nHe shared: \"My career adviser said to me, 'Put singing last as you're more likely to be a fireman.'\" bang showbiz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:47:40.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
