The company had taken the huge amount of loan from IDBI Banks despite their already negative credit ratings. As per a Times of India Report, CBI has filed First Information Report (FIR) in the loan fraud. The investigation agency has been investigating loans received by private companies from public sector banks. Vijay Mallya will also be questioned in the probe. (Also Read: Vijay Mallya’s plea rejected by Supreme Court in foreign exchange rules) Raids by the investigation agency were part of their banking NPA frauds probe. According to TOI Reprot, CBI alleged, ”it was first exposure to the bank. There was no need for the bank to take the exposure outside the consortium when already other loans were getting stressed”. Kingfisher and IDBI officials were also quizzed in the probe asking the reason for lending loan to a defunct company. The airlines had stopped in October 2012 after debts mounted up. The CBI said that they have registered a total of 27 inquiries. Last year after the bank failed to give convincing answers to CBI, they had filed a preliminary inquiry. The agency’s probe is part of the investigation into non-performing assets of various public sector banks. CBI sources said that they searched Mallya’s residence in Mumbai, Goa, Bangalore and other places. \n  5:17 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T14:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T16:27:22.636+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
