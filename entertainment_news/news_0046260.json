He's just so good.\" Image caption Alejandro Amenabar married partner David Blanco in July \nThe film is set in the US state of Minnesota in 1990 and follows Ethan Hawke's character, Detective Bruce Kenner, as he investigates a man who's admitted sexually abusing his daughter Angela, played by Emma Watson. \nTalking on the Radio 1 Breakfast Show with Nick Grimshaw, the British actress admits it's a pretty dark movie. \n\"It is really dark and it's one of those awesome films where you think you know what it's going to be and then it's something completely different, which I think is pretty awesome.\" \nHowever things weren't all doom and gloom on set. \nEmma has a lot of praise for co-star Ethan Hawke, who's appeared in dozens of films including Training Day, Boyhood and 1989's Dead Poets Society. Image caption Ethan Hawke has been promoting another of his films, Maggie's Plan, recently \nShe says they had a lot in common. \n\"He's just such a joy to be around. Every day he would come into the make-up trailer playing a different instrument. \n\"Sometimes he'd rock up with a trumpet, sometimes he'd rock up with a guitar, sometimes he'd be singing. He'd always be reading something interesting. \n\"He was just really nice to be around. He was also a child actor, so it was nice. I got to talk to him a lot about what that's like.\" \n\"Getting a film put together right, to me, feels like a lunar eclipse. \n\"It's this perfect miracle of all of these happenings happening at the same moment. So the right director with the right cast with enough money to get it made properly. \n\"All these disparate elements have to arrive at the same perfect moment. Sometimes it happens, and sometimes it doesn't. It always feels a little bit iffy I guess.\" \nFollow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter, BBCNewsbeat on Instagram, Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube and you can now follow BBC_Newsbeat on Snapchat Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T18:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:41:37.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
