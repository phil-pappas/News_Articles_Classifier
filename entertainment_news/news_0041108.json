Most of my scenes are with Salman sir, so I enjoyed a lot while shooting the film.\"\nWhile Swara is working with Rajshri Productions for the first time, she admits that she has never met a human being as wonderful as director Sooraj Barjatya.\n\"The kind of films Sooraj sir makes, he is actually like that. It sounds cliched, but I have never met such a good human being in my life. He is so good and sometimes I feel how bad I am,\" Swara said.\n'Prem Ratan Dhan Payo', which brings together Bollywood's once indomitable team of Salman Khan and Sooraj Barjatya after 16 years, also stars Sonam Kapoor, Neil Nitin Mukesh and Anupam Kher in key roles.\nThe film is set to release on November 12, a day after the festival of Diwali.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T11:02:00.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
