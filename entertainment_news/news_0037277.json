(Paul Buck/ EPA) Bethonie Butler The Washington Post What we know about Tracy Morgan's hosting stint on \"SNL\" \nTracy Morgan will host \"Saturday Night Live\" this weekend, marking a triumphant return for the comedian and \"SNL\" alum, who survived a horrific car crash last year. \nMorgan suffered a traumatic brain injury after a Wal-Mart trailer tractor slammed into his limo bus on the New Jersey Turnpike in June of 2014. \nIn promo videos for Saturday's episode, Morgan pokes fun at the injury, pretending not to remember his time on \"SNL\" or that Bobby Moynihan and Horatio Sanz are two different people. He also delivers his signature joke: \"I'm gonna get everyone in this building pregnant!\" \nMorgan riffed on that joke in an emotional (and surprise) appearance at the Emmy Awards last month. \"I miss you guys so much,\" he told the audience. \"It's been a long road back.\" \nIndeed, it's been a long recovery for the 46-year-old, also well-known for his self-parodying role as Tracy Jordan on \"30 Rock.\" Months after the accident, there were doubts as to whether the comedian would ever be able to work again. During SNL's 40th anniversary special in February, Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin paid tribute to Morgan, who was noticeably absent. \nIn June, Morgan appeared on the \"Today\" show in his first interview following the accident. He held onto a cane as he tearfully spoke with Matt Lauer about the extent of his injuries and the loss of his friend, comedy writer James McNair, who was killed in the crash.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T13:18:22.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
