Beer fans turned out to represent their favorites in the AL.com Alabama signature beer poll, with Rocket Republic Mach 1 IPA claiming bragging rights.\nBut we also wanted to know, what would a taste test reveal? And so AL.com gathered a panel of three taste testers to sample the beers that made it to the statewide poll: Rocket Republic Mach 1 IPA, Fairhope Take the Causeway IPA and Black Warrior Broad Street Brown.\nMeet our panelists\nThe beer expert: Stuart Carter is a past president and current board member of Free the Hops, the grassroots lobbying group that worked to change restrictive beer laws in Alabama. He also works as a freelance IT and beer consultant.\nThe food and drinks expert: Clair McLafferty is a bartender and freelance writer who specializes in food and drinks coverage. She writes a regular cocktail column for mentalfloss.com .\nThe lay person: Monica Aswani is a doctoral student at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. When presented with the option of beer, wine or a cocktail, she'll choose beer nearly every time.\nWe asked the panelists to describe the aroma and taste of each beer, suggest food pairings and tell us which is their favorite. What did they think? I suppose you'll have to watch the video to find out.\nShare your favorite brewery tips with al.com reporter Carla Jean Whitley on Facebook or Twitter , see what she's drinking at Untappd and join in her regular travels to Alabama breweries via Instagram .
