The Big Read Holland Area is around the corner and we couldn’t be more excited. The idea that hundreds of people across our community will soon be reading this year’s book selection and discussing it in all kinds of venues from classrooms to art galleries and churches to bars shows just how much our community is committed to reading. It also shows how we can all come together to discuss important things like the impact of the Vietnam War on our nation. The Big Read is developed around the theme “An entire community reading one book together,” and is funded by a grant program of the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) in partnership with Arts Midwest. This year’s book selection is \"The Things They Carried\" by Tim O’Brien, a book about one platoon’s Vietnam experience. November’s Big Read Holland Area lineup will involve 10 main events including a visit from the author and at least 20 book discussions in various community locations. Hope College and Herrick District Library are the primary partners, but many other partners have stepped up to be involved. As a committee member for the project, I have been amazed at how many people have come out of the woodwork to offer their services, talents, and financial gifts to help make The Big Read Holland Area a program that will reach far and wide across our community. One such example includes the Ottawa Area Intermediate School District’s work helping to create an event where students from 10 different schools, guided by local artist Joel Schoon-Tanis, will present their artistic responses to the book. Another example includes the work of local artist Carolyn Stich who will lead art workshops for community members served by organizations like Family Hope Ministries and the Center for Women in Transition. Area Veteran’s organizations and their leaders have been very supportive and have provided financial assistance for the project. Individuals like Dr. Russ Dykstra and businesses like Branch Capital Management have provided financial gifts. Area veterans have shared their stories with us and many are willing to share them publicly. People with family members who served in Vietnam have loaned memorabilia like Vietnam era uniforms and military artifacts for displays in Van Wylen and Herrick libraries. The involvement of so many across our community makes The Big Read Holland Area the incredible project that it is. Our committee is honored to soon implement this program alongside so many great faces from those behind the scenes to those that volunteer to those that will attend. If you would like to be involved in The Big Read Holland Area, contact us at Herrick District Library by calling (616) 355-3720, or visiting communityrelationsdept@herrickdl.org . To access a copy of The Things They Carried, visit the express books section of the main Herrick District Library location for a one-week check out, or be one of the first 50 people to ask for one at the main library information desk on Saturday, Oct. 31.
