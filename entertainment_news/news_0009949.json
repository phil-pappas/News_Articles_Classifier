It is filled with advice on how to analyze these trends, assess risk, and attain prosperity with minimal uncertainty.\nThis is the book that many on Wall Street may not want conservative investors to be aware of as it may affect their interest in unknowingly participating in secular bear markets.\nConversely, many on Wall Street may be aware of the secular markets but not fully aware of secular bear market dynamics. Within the context of this book, many financial writers and television pundits often convey some pretty silly concepts about long-term market averages.\nThe book was written for those who do not need to take excessive risk with what has already been hard earned. It will also be useful for newcomers and intermediates to the markets in evaluating risk. For the more adequately funded with hands on inclinations, a clearer picture of risk is presented.\nReaders who wish to experience this educational work can purchase “The Everyday Millionaire's Guide to Low Market Risk and Steady Returns” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708.\nAbout Page Publishing\nPage Publishing is a traditional New York based full-service publishing house that handles all of the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
