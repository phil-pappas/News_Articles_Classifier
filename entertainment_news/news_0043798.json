(Photo: David Edwards)\n13 CONNECT 36 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Collaborations do work.\nThat's our take on FFS — a new band comprised of the members of Scottish alternative quartet Franz Ferdinand and Los Angeles experimental duo Sparks — even if its self-titled debut album contains a cheeky song to the contrary ( Collaborations Don't Work ).\nThe two FFS singers, Alex Kapranos (Franz Ferdinand) and Russell Mael (Sparks), visited USA TODAY's Dad Rock podcast for an in-studio interview with cohosts Patrick Foster and Jim Lenahan.\nThe FFS project has been long-simmering. Shortly after the release of Franz Ferdinand's debut album in 2004 (containing the alt-dance hit Take Me Out ), members of the two bands began talking about working together someday. They eventually started writing songs together via email between Scotland and California, and a two-week recording session followed — the first time the members had worked together in person. The resulting album, FFS, mixes textures of both bands while sounding original. It has elements of new wave, dance and indie rock — and tons of wry humor. FFS is touring North America through Oct. 15.\nAll episodes of Dad Rock are available on:\niTunes\n(Subscribe on iTunes to get new episodes automatically every week.)\nSoundCloud\nStitcher\nTuneIn\nStream or download the FFS episode here:\nSome highlights from the interview:\nThe musicians wrote songs by trading files over 6,000 miles. \"It's very easy to do that nowadays,\" Kapranos says. \"Sometimes it would be a more complete song which was sent over. Sometimes it would be a musical idea and the other party would add a vocal line and lyrics and sometimes it would be a lyric that was sent over and the other person would add music to it. But it was cool. It's like having a pen pal sending stuff over. You're waiting to hear what's gonna happen next. It's like getting Christmas presents every month.\"\nThe members of Franz Ferdinand and Sparks treated FFS like a new band. \"There's something incredibly liberating about that,\" Kapranos says. \"There's no rules. There's no expectations. We don't have to sound like our old bands because we're creating something new.\"\nSparks' Achoo was among the first songs Franz Ferdinand attempted to learn when starting out. \"It's incredible how things work out and how your path sort of follows these strange routes,\" Kapranos says. \"Here we are on stage playing that song again, 12 years later, with Ron (Mael) and Russell.\"\nRussell Mael remembers the first time he heard Take Me Out. \"Occasionally and all-too-infrequently a song comes along that jolts you and you prick up your ears,\" he says. \"You just get kind of frustrated that there's too few songs like that, that the ambition seems to be at a staggering low level. ... Sometimes you feel like you're working all alone out there as a band and you have no soulmates in how you see pop music to be. So anyway, Take Me Out was one of those songs that if you're driving along and you hear it, you kind of have to pull off to the side of the road and wait until the DJ announces who it was.\"\nFranz Ferdinand's guitar-driven, dance-beat sound developed out a reaction against the male-targeted indie rock scene of the 2000s. \"We wanted to be almost like a pre-rock band, almost like a beat combo ... and everything's super-stripped back; there's no excess ... yet marrying that to beats that we were hearing in the clubs at the same time,\" Kapranos says. \"It felt for us that the most rebellious thing we could do would be to play a melody and to play dance music and to play the kind of music that girls would want to come and see.\"\nOn whether FFS will continue past this album and tour. \"We had no idea that this was going to be an album in the first place,\" Kapranos says. \"And I guess that's how I still feel now. I have no idea. Let's wait and see.\" Says Mael: \"We're very unbusinesslike, both bands, and that's a good thing.\"\nMusic featured (or referenced) on the podcast:\nLearn more about Dad Rock at dadrock.usatoday.com.\nFollow Dad Rock on Twitter @DadRockShow\nEmail Patrick and Jim at dadrock@usatoday.com\nLeave a message on the Dad Rock Hotline: 571-424-1984\nLearn more about FFS at ffsmusic.com\nFollow FFS on Twitter @FFS_MUSIC\n13 CONNECT 36 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT //usat.ly/1RyxRK2 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RyxRK2&mini=true", "http://tunein.com/radio/USA-TODAY-Dad-Rock-p721528/", "https://twitter.com/DadRockShow", "https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/dad-rock/id983293722?mt=2", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RyxRK2&text=Dad%20Rock%3A%20Franz%20Ferdinand%20and%20Sparks%20unite&via=usatoday", "http://linkmaker.itunes.apple.com/images/badges/en-us/badge_itunes-lrg.svg", "http://usat.ly/1RyxRK2", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799970889155611-FFS2260---photo-credit-David-Edwards--300dpi.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f102b06d875336090119e13575560beb7106b0b6/c=294-0-4902-3465&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799970889155611-FFS2260---photo-credit-David-Edwards--300dpi.jpg", "https://soundcloud.com/dadrockshow", "https://twitter.com/FFS_MUSIC", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/dad-rock/id983293722?mt=2", "http://www.ffsmusic.com/#tour", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799970889155611-FFS2260---photo-credit-David-Edwards--300dpi.jpg", "http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/usa-today/dad-rock"], "published": "2015-10-09T23:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T20:48:36.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
