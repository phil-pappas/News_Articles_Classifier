(Originally published by the Daily News on October 15, 1977. This story was written by Amador Marin.)\nMadrid - Bing Crosby, the crooner of beautiful songs who dominated show business for three generations of lovers around the world, died here yesterday of a heart attack after completing a round of golf. \"Der Bingle\" was 73, and his death produced shock and grief among millions of devoted fans.\nThe end for the man with the gold baritone voice and relaxed, pipe-smoking humor came at the end of a 4 Â½ - hour round of his beloved golf during which the great singer and actor was described as \"happy and singing\" - fresh from an acclaimed tour of Britain. He had come to Spain for a few days of rest and relaxation.\nCrosby had been playing with three prominent Spanish golfers on the La Moraleja club course on the outskirts of Madrid, and the foursome had just left the 18th hole late in the afternoon. The four happy players were walking back to the clubhouse when Crosby was seized by a heart attack and slumped to the ground.\n\"We thought he had just slipped,\" said one of the Bing's playing comrades, Valentin Barrios, a champion Spanish golfer. \"We took him to the clubhouse and he was given oxygen and cardiac tonic injections, but nothing could be done, Bing had shown no signs of fatigue. He was happy and singing as we went around the course.\"\nCrosby, Barrios said, did not utter a sound as he fell to the turf.\n\"There were no last words,\" Barrios said.\nTaken to Hospital\nIt was about 6:30 p.m. on a warm sunny afternoon here when Crosby died. He was taken to the Red Cross Hospital in Madrid in an ambulance, but doctors there could do nothing. He was pronounced dead on arrival. \"We carried him to the clubhouse, but it was already too late,\" said another member of the foursome, Manuel Pinero, the current Spanish golf champion.\n\"We were walking back to the clubhouse chatting and happy that we had won,\" Pinero said last night, as he recalled how he and Crosby had defeated Barrios and another Spanish golfer, Cesar de Zulueta, president of La Moraleja club.\nCrosby's last game of golf was good. \"Bing played better than Thursday, when he shot 92,\" Barrios told reporters.\nAn Old Red Sweater\nTo the end, Crosby was fun-loving and informal Juan Gandaras, 33, a Spanish businessman who had lunched with Crosby and then followed the foursome as a spectator, said Crosby was wearing an old red sweater and a white sunhat. Bing had been sensitive in recent years about his increasing baldness.\n\"During lunch, we were joking about the sweater,\" Gandaras said.\nNew York Daily News Cover of the New York Daily News on October 15, 1977.

Previous Next Enlarge A doctor in the clubhouse infirmary gave the mortally stricken Crosby an injection and a pill, but it was to no avail. The doctor said that Crosby had died of \"a massive heart attack.\"\nSpanish television interrupted its programs to announce the death of Crosby, saying: \"Spain mourns the loss of a beloved man.\"\nSurvived Fall From Stage\nIn California, Crosby's grief-stricken widow, Kathryn, let it be known that son Harry Lillis Jr., 19, and Alan Butler, the family's former butler, would fly from England to Spain to accompany Crosby's body from Madrid to Los Angeles. The remains were expected to arrive in the United States on Monday.\nIt was announced that Crosby would probably be buried in the family plot in a Los Angeles cemetery with his mother, father and first wife, Dixie Lee.\nCrosby's death sent shock waves into every corner of the world. He was perhaps the best-known entertainer in history. Crosby had survived a near fatal fall from a California stage last March and bounced back. His recent tour of Britain was a smash.\nSo beloved was Crosby that even during World War II, when Crosby's songs were broadcast to German troops in the field, they gobbled them up and gave him a monicker that stuck: \"Der Bingle.\"\nThe singer, whose recording of \"White Christmas\" sold more copies than any other record in history, was stilled on the place he loved best - a golf course. His annual $150,000 Bing Crosby Invitation Tournament at Pebble Beach, Calif., was one of the best known golfing events in the world and he always made the sports pages by clowning it up with his favorite foil - Bob Hope.\nString of \"Road\" Movies\nHope and Crosby were the stars, with Dorothy Lamour, of a string of \"Road\" movies, including the \"Road to Morocco\" - from which they extracted one of their biggest hit records, the title song.\nThey frequently broke into laughs as they sang the song for millions and hit the tagline: \"Like Webster's dictionary, we're Morocco bound.\"\nCrosby was many times a millionaire, picking up giant royalties on his records and movies and more millions with radio and television commercials for \"Minute Maid\" orange juice. His record sales topped more than 300 million, and he appeared in 57 movies.\nCrosby was a golfer of almost professional skill, and he was an expert hunter and fisherman who went on safaris in Africa and hooked marlin off Baja California. His golf game was in the low 70s until the advancing years put a hitch in his swing.\nBob Hope, left and Bing Crosby swap \"insults\" tempered with admiration along with songs from their \"Road To....\" and other motion pictures when \"Chrysler presents the Bob Hope Special\".

She was 29 years younger than Bing, but they had three children and the kids, too, often appeared in the TV ads, Grant and the three children, Mary Frances, Nathaniel and Harry, plus four children by Dixie Lee, who died of cancer in 1952. Crosby and Miss Lee had been married for 22 years.\nCrosby had come to Spain after his triumphal tour of Britain that included a sold-out run at London's famed Palladium. His purpose here was to rest and relax and play golf, and he was to have joined Spanish friends today in a partridge hunt. Bing was a crack shot. He had also planned to travel on to the Spanish island of Majorca in the Mediterranean Sea.\nTrudy Berger, the cook at the Crosby home in Hillsborough, Calif., near San Francisco, said last night: \"he had been feeling fine. We were expecting him back in a day or two. \"\nIn every generation there comes a handful of performers whose talent and personality make their names show business magic. Such a performer was Harry Lillis Crosby.\nHe was Bing, Der Bingle and the Groaner to millions during a career as a headline star that spanned almost four decades and ran the gamut of show business media from the bandstand to television.\nHe made crooning - the description of his mellow, smooth-flowing vocal style - a familiar part of the language.\nOrigin of Name \"Bing\"\nBing Crosby was born May 2, 1904, in Tacoma, Wash., the fourth of seven children of Harry Lowe Crosby, a book keeper, and Kate Harrigan Crosby. The youngest of the children, Bob, also was to achieve fame as a singer and bandleader.\nHe acquired the nickname Bing while still a child. There were many versions of how it came about, but Bing himself said it was because of his devotion to a comic strip character of the time known as Bingo.\nAs a youth Bing entered Gonzaga University in Spokane, Wash., where the family had moved, to study law. He remained for three years, long enough to form a dance combo to play at school events and later a twosome with another student, Al Rinker.\nRinker and Crosby signed up for the vaudeville circuit and won the attention of Bandleader Paul Whiteman added Harry Barris to the group and the trio, dubbed the Rhythm Boys, became a fixture with the Whiteman band.\nThe trio went on its own in the late 1920s to make appearances in night clubs and music halls, but by 1930 Bing had launched himself as a single, crooning in night clubs and acting in onereelers produced by Mack Sennett.\nBing got his start in feature length romantic musicals with Paramount in 1932 with \"The Big Broadcast,\" followed by \"College Humor,\" \"Going Hollywood\" and \"Mississippi.\"\nDan Farrell Singer and actor Bing Crosby's real name is Harry Lillis Crosby Jr. In 1935 he began a 10-year run on the Kraft Music Hall, a weekly hour long radio show that he usually carried on while puffing a pipe and lounging casually in flamboyant attire that became the butt of many of the program's jokes.\nA friendly feud with long-time friend Bob Hope started during the radio series and blossomed into a profitable association in movies and television.\nTogether they made the famous \"Road to\" movies that took them to Singapore, Zanzibar, Bali and Hong Kong to the merry jingle of box office cash registers.\nBing's other movies during this period included \"Birth of the Blues,\" \"Holiday Inn,\" \"The Country Girl\" and \"High Society,\" as well as two pictures, \"Going My Way\" and \"Bells of St. Mary's,\" in which he portrayed a Catholic priest. The role he played most consistently and successfully, however, was Bing Crosby, the carefree and relaxed music man.\nRecords Sold in Millions\nHis hit records were beyond counting. \"White Christmas\" was the greatest seller in disc history, but it was \"Where the Blue of the Night Meets the Gold of the Day\" and \"I Surrender, Dear\" that started him on his way.\nWhen television became popular, Bing slipped into the new medium gradually and confined himself pretty much to hosting or appearing in special shows. His one venture into a situation comedy series, in 1964, ended disastrously.\nAlthough there may have been stars during the Crosby era who earned as much as Bing, none held on to more or were more successful in making it grow. Guided by his canny brother, Everett, Bing plowed his money into oil, real estate, food processing and a host of other ventures until he was many times a millionaire.\nAnother Million\nEven a Nevada cattle ranch he bought originally as a hideaway was converted into $1 million in 1958.\nA four-sport athlete in high school, Bing was an enthusiastic sports fan all his life. His half ownership of a string of race horses in the 1930s and 1940s brought in more laughs than purses, but he fared better on his shares in Del Mar race track and two major league baseball teams, the Pittsburgh Pirates and Detroit Tigers. He also established, in 1937, a pro-amateur golf tournament that, as the Crosby Open, became one of the biggest features of the pro golf winter circuit.\nDespite his public fame, Bing made few concessions to his popularity in guarding the privacy of his home life. In 1930 he married actress-singer Dixie Lee, nÃ©e Wilma Wyatt, when she was a star and he was only on the verge of success.\nShe gave up her career to raise their four sons, Gary, twins Philip and Dennis, and Lindsay, all of whom later entered show business but with indifferent success.\nIn his later years, Der Bingle became less active, devolving more and more of his time to golf and his family. But he still made major appearances in U.S. and foreign cities and performed in several television specials.\nTags: archives", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:40:11.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
