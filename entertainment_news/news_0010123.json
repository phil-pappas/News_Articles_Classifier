It is the only song in the film and Aishvarrya is happy to have rendered the number. \"I got a call from Ghibran's office and they wanted me to record a song. It didn't strike me for what film I'm singing for until I read the lyrics, which had the word Thoongavanam in it. Kamal sir had already recorded the song and I was roped in a little later. It is a big deal for me because this is only my second song (Her first song was for the film, Inimey Ippadithaan), and I got a chance to work with big names in the industry,\" says Aishvarrya. About music composer Ghibran, she says, \"He has a knack of putting you at ease. We took about two hours to record the song in Tamil and Telugu, and I ended up doing something in this song that I never knew I could do â€” to sing metal.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:28:13.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
