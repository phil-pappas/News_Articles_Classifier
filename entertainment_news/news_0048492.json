You can vote for your favourite below. Stuart Henshall, 35 - eliminated week 1 \nTattooed musician Stu, from Surrey, was the one in the hat who was berated for being a \"hipster\". Unfortunately, Stu and his trilby were sent packing in the first episode when his decision to use beetroot in a Black Forest Gateaux didn't go down too well with the judges. \nBest bit: when he uttered a clever alternative to swearing - \"holy shenanigans!\" \nTimes Star Baker – 0 Marie Campbell, 66 - eliminated week 2 \nScottish grandmother Marie came to baking later in life but wasted no time in winning star baker in the very first episode. Scandal wasn't far behind, though, when she was plagued with reports that she had once attended a patisserie course at the famous Ecole Escoffier in Paris . She wasn't breaking the rules of Bake Off but it didn't really matter - her competition crumbled in biscuit week when she failed to finish the technical challenge. \nBest bit: flirting with Paul Hollywood for extra marks. \nTimes Star Baker – 1 Dorret Conway, 53 - eliminated week 3 \nEmotions ran high for Dorret from the start. She was left sobbing after the sloppy mousse in her Black Forest gateaux caused it to collapse. She survived elimination and won the arlette technical challenge in week two, but her showstopper bread version of Tracey Emin's Unmade Bed failed to secure her place in the competition. \nTimes Star Baker – 0 Sandy Docherty, 49 - eliminated week 4 \nSandy was definitely one of the more entertaining contestants in this year's competition - we'll certainly never forget her glitter slippers! But her gung-ho approach to cooking let her down when she served up a three-tiered cheesecake that failed to be a three-tiered cheesecake. \nBest bit: her bone-dry Bradford wit. Sample quote: \"A creme brulee should wobble like my backside.\" \nTimes Star Baker – 0 Ugne Bubnaityte, 32 - eliminated week 5 \nLithuanian bodybuilder Ugne wasn't afraid of a theatrics - her bakes came in all shapes and sizes and crazy colours. Remember that fondant baby? But she came unstuck in Free From (low-fat and gluten-free) week, a technique in which health-conscious Bubnaityte should have thrived. \nBest bit: talking about her Madeira cake: \"Hopefully the taste will be good and my crack will show.\" \nTimes Star Baker – 0 Alvin Magallanes, 37 - eliminated week 6 \nTears, tremors and timing issues - Alvin was one of the nerviest bakers but the public would root for him, especially every time he would apologize, saying \"sorry Sir\" to judge Paul Hollywood. \nBest bit: when he made enough bread to feed the entire country. \nTimes Star Baker – 0 Mat Riley, 37 - eliminated week 7 \nA fondant tennis court proved to be the end for fireman Mat but his ever-cheery presence was a delight throughout the show: \"There’s dough everywhere. It’s doughverload.” \nBest bit: when he presented an antique pie tin borrowed from the mother of his mate, \"Dangerous Dave”. \nTimes Star Baker – 1 Paul Jagger, 49 - eliminated week 8 \nWelsh prison governor Paul, something of a lookalike for judge Paul Hollywood, just failed to make the semi-finals. He was partial to a bit of intricate sugar-work but was axed when his showstopping Religieuse a l'ancienne collapsed. \nBest bit: when he wowed with his King of the Jungle bread lion . \nTimes Star Baker – 0 Flora Shedden, 19 - eliminated week 9 \nThis year's youngest baker worked her socks off and created some of the most beautiful-looking bakes. Despite triumphing in the semi-final technical challenge with her first ever chocolate soufflé, she was sent home when her chocolate carousel was described by judge Paul Hollywood as “wonky”. \nBest bit: dissing the boss - “Paul Hollywood was punching bread and shattering dreams in there. It was nasty.” \nTimes Star Baker – 0 Tamal Ray, 29 - finalist \nDoe-eyed trainee anaesthetist Tamal brought his pipet to the tent and could regularly be seen injecting his bakes with delicious fillings. He rightly made the final after producing outstanding creations such as chequerboard biscuits and a bread bicycle with Chelsea buns for wheels. \nBest bit: “I’ve never made a soufflé, let alone a chocolate one so… Awesome!” \nTimes Star Baker – 1 Ian Cumming, 41 - finalist \nIt was obvious that there would be no messing with this man when he took the star baker award three times running. Precision and construction were key to his success, and perhaps the odd wink from Mary Berry helped him along the way. \nFun fact: his chocolate well was a magnificent creation. \nTimes Star Baker – 3 Nadiya Hussain, 30 - finalist \nHer range of facial expressions have been the best thing about this year's Bake Off. Aside from that, her baking has been okay too. She's improved drastically over the weeks, going from consistently coming last in the technical challenges to taking the star baker accolade three times. \nBest bit: her fizzy pop cheesecakes were a stroke of genius. \nTimes Star Baker – 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T17:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:19:03.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
