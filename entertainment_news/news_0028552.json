We were wondering if he’d given up by this point, especially after Chip’s response to Tinie Tempah that was released on Tuesday showed absolutely no mercy. Bugzy replies at his own peril. \nTitled simply Wasteman, and released via Link Up TV , Bugzy teased the track earlier in the day, getting a huge amount of retweets as everyone prepared for the next instalment between the Manchester based MC and the one from Tottenham. \n— Bugzy Malone (@TheBugzyMalone) October 21, 2015 \nSee what you think of it for yourself. \nThe response to it hasn’t been great. Bugzy flew to the top of the Twitter trending list, but if he was to click on his name , we doubt he’d be pleased with what people are saying. Bugzy defo studied hair and beauty, all man did was talk about chip's mohican Where was the 0161?😂so Bugzy made Chip cut his hair but Chip made Bugzy stop repping his own ends🐸☕️ Promoted stories \n— Mr 17.5 (@Ikechampion) October 21, 2015 Chip is miles better than Bugzy Malone and it's not even a debate \n— Betty Wap (@TweetsByBetty) October 21, 2015 \nHonestly, we did try and find a positive comment, this is about as good as it got though. Bugzy isn't dead at all, I just think he's punching above his weight \n— DeadstockGrime (@DeadStockGrimeT) October 21, 2015 \nBut there’s more bad news for Bugzy – Chip may have managed to embarrass him before the track was even released, pre-empting and writing off some of its content and also announcing he’d have a reply ready just five hours after Bugzy’s. \nNone of the bars had been written before Bugzy announced his intentions. Bugzy Malone: I'm releasing it at 6pm tonig…..Chipmunk: pic.twitter.com/OLxNrfaTxd \n— E1. (@thecolourdeebs) October 21, 2015 \nThe Manchester man is probably wishing he didn’t mention Chip’s pop music past again. If man says 0161 and speaks about cars or how he finished a pop star the diss shouldn't be uploaded really ca we got those bars already. Lol \n— Chipmunk (@OfficialChip) October 21, 2015 \nIt’s true then, Chip really, really can’t “run out of bars”. \nChip’s response, due to come out at 11pm, will be his second reply in two days – the first being to Tinie Tempah, who kicked off this whole beef in Chip’s view – after Tinie had a bit to say at 1xtra Live in Leeds. Chip applying that high press onto Tinie and Bugzy. No time to play out from the back. pic.twitter.com/JiZzfbl4SM \nChip’s speed in the response, and the quality too, will probably have shocked Tinie – as well as the fact he recorded over Ruff Sqwad’s Together, something we never thought we’d hear used for a diss track. \nHere’s the verse Chip was responding to. pic.twitter.com/KFwGZjP9CU Going to get pop corn brb \n— P Money (@KingPMoney) October 18, 2015 \nThe track Tinie performed, which may be on a mixtape rumoured to be coming out soon, apparently featured a hook from Stormzy – but Stormzy had no idea what it was going to be used for. I stand alone. I am a grown fucking man. Don't mix me in nothing I ain't involved in. Don't twist my angles!! \nSo, the year kicked off with this beef and now it’s really hotting up. Who would’ve predicted in 2014 that 2015 would be such a good year for grime? \nAnd for anyone who’s managing to still keep up with it all, you deserve an award.
