But, more often than not, the words get the job done as neatly as the music. \n\"Kinky Boots\" couldn't have much more persuasive advocates than those in the touring cast. As witty and wise Lola, Kyle Taylor Parker proves every bit as satisfying as originator Billy Porter, right down to the Eartha Kitt-on-steroids purring. It's worth catching the show just to hear Parker say, with profound and hilarious contempt, the word \"burgundy\" (the first color choice for a boot presented to him at the factory). He's also a sturdy, warmly expressive singer. \nSteven Booth deftly conveys Charlie's journey from ambivalence to confidence, reaching a peak in the angry outbursts of Act 2. The actor handles humorous bits with equal flair. His voice is a little too light for the more driving rock songs in the score, but his phrasing invariably rings true. \nAmong the supporting players, Lindsay Nicole Chambers stands out as Lauren, offering a funny array of vocal inflections. She even manages to make some of the most cliched lines in the script sound natural. As Don, the bully who gets his comeuppance, Joe Coots hits the spot. And the gang of Angels, Lola's fellow drag performers, could not be much more assured or stylish. Likewise, the ensemble of factory workers couldn't look more true-to-life. \nDavid Rockwell's large, richly evocative scenic design and Gregg Barnes' spot-on costumes complete the appeal of this well-polished production. \n\"Kinky Boots\" runs through Oct. 4 at the Hippodrome Theatre, 12 N.
