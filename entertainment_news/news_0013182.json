Thayer sailed the West Coast 120 years ago to deliver lumber from the vast forests of the Northwest to fuel the growth of California's cities.\nThe era is long gone, but the Thayer -- the last of its kind -- is making a comeback, with plans for it to sail again on the San Francisco Bay with its giant sheets billowing in the wind.\nIn the next-to-last phase of its $14 million-plus restoration by the National Park Service, the Thayer was towed Thursday from its national maritime park dock in San Francisco to an Alameda shipyard for installation of three, 120-foot-tall wooden masts.\nThe 219-foot wooden ship returns early next year to its San Francisco dock west of Fisherman's Wharf, where crews will install rigging.\n\"When we're finished, we will have a nearly brand-new, 1800s lumber schooner,\" said Jeff Morris, the historical ships manager at the San Francisco National Maritime Historical Park. \"I would love to take it sailing. But there are many details and issues to be worked out before we can take this national historical landmark out sailing.\"\nNo one, he said, wants to break a 1895 national treasure that will have taken 13 years to restore when the job is complete next year.\n\"Our main mission is preserving this schooner for future generations,\" Morris said. \"But I think there is a way -- carefully -- it can sail again.\"\nMost of the 500 or so West Coast lumber schooners operating between the 1860s and early 1900s lasted about 20 years before wearing out. Steam-powered ships made them obsolete.\nThe Thayer, named for a lumber company owner, averted a death by rot or salvage by finding multiple lives as a salmon- and cod-fishing boat after its lumber-hauling career from 1895 to 1912.\nThe Thayer sailed until 1950, becoming the last commercial sailing schooner on the West Coast.\n\"It's the last lumber schooner from its time,\" said Lynn Cullivan, a National Park Service spokesman for the maritime historical park. \"It's an important landmark of the history of the West Coast. There are probably many old buildings in San Francisco with lumber that was brought here by the Thayer.\"\nThe second-to-last West Coast lumber schooner, the Wawona, was salvaged in Seattle in 2009 after a campaign to maintain her ran out of money.\nSaving the Thayer isn't easy or cheap. Its hull was rebuilt almost piece by piece from 2003 to 2006, with about 80 percent of the wood replaced with 340,000 board feet of Douglas fir timber.\nAn original mast for a lumber schooner in the 1800s would have been milled from a single tall straight tree. But finding a tree like it in modern forests would be extremely difficult, Morris said.\nLaminated masts for the Thayer were built by Sentinel Structures, a company in Peshtigo, Wis., that has supplied parts for many historic ship restorations.\nCrews in the coming weeks will cut three holes in the Thayer's deck and install the masts with cranes at the Bay Ship and Yacht dry dock in Alameda.\nThe San Francisco Maritime National Park Association, a nonprofit group, donated the money to buy new sails.\n\"We think the restoration will put her in shape to last another 100 years,\" Morris said. \"It's part of history we want to keep.\"\nSCHOONER THAYER'S HISTORY\n1895: Built and named after lumber company partner\n1895 to 1912: Carried lumber along West Coast\n1912 to 1922: Used as salmon fishing boat\n1925 to 1930: Used for cod fishing\n1930s: Not put to use\n1942: Used as ammunition hauling boat\n1946 to 1950: Used for cod fishing again\nNow: Declared a national landmark, it is getting a $14 million restoration\n(c)2015 Contra Costa Times (Walnut Creek, Calif.)\nVisit the Contra Costa Times (Walnut Creek, Calif.) at www.contracostatimes.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1738496&h=Last+West+Coast+lumber+schooner+nears+final+steps+to+13%2Dyear+restoration", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1738496&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1738496"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:02:26.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
