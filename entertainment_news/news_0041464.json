Fox, receives a dismissal notice at home by fax -- a now-clunky technology that seemed cutting-edge in the 1980s. The Internet revolution was lurking just around the corner, and the world had yet to receive email.\nIn 1985, only about a quarter of US households had a microwave oven, and videocassette recorders (VCRs) were the must-have viewing technology.\nToday you can buy a home 3-D printer on the Internet for a few hundred dollars, which can produce anything from a gun that squirts water to one that shoots bullets.\nWe can \"download\" songs and \"stream\" films -- terms that did not even exist in 1985.\nView gallery Technology we would now struggle without -- such as Google and Wikipedia, social networking sites Fa … We can edit the human genome to fix disease-causing DNA, we have grown hamburger \"meat\" from cow muscle cells, and we have placed a robot probe on a comet hundreds of millions of kilometres from Earth.\n\"Humans very quickly get used to innovations and take them for granted,\" said Dawson, founder of the Future Exploration Network, which offers scenario planning services.\nStill, the film did get some things right.\nWe do have flat screens, live video-calling, tablet computers, and portable up-to-the-minute weather apps.\nThough not yet in full swing, we also have biometric technology for paying bills or unlocking doors with a fingerprint, and off-the-shelf smart glasses similar to those worn by Marty's offspring.\n\n- More sci than fi? -\nView gallery US actor Christopher Lloyd, who plays \"Doc\" Brown in the movie \"Back to the Future II … \n\"It was actually quite visionary of them to get so many things right,\" said Thomas Frey of the DaVinci Institute, a futurist thinktank.\n\"They depicted it in kind of a comical, goofy way actually, but I think they did quite a phenomenal job back then of anticipating things that must have seemed fairly ludicrous at the time.\"\nSome predictions were ahead of their time.\nThirty years ago, most futurists would have given flying cars by 2015 \"greater than 50-50 odds,\" independent futurist Jack Uldrich told AFP by telephone from Minneapolis.\n\"There are some companies that are working on flying cars, but what they don't have is that take-off (vertical) lift,\" as demonstrated by Doc's DeLorean.\nInnovators have drawn inspiration from the movie: California-based firm Hendo is creating a hoverboard which works on magnetic repulsion. Shoemaker Nike is working on sneakers with self-tightening \"power laces\" like the ones Marty wore.\n\n- What next? -\nSci-fi has influenced scientific advancement through the ages, but the task may become harder as technological development accelerates exponentially.\nWill humans be teleporting, travelling in time, or discover the secret to eternal life by 2045? Who knows, the experts say.\n\"One of the things which we could very easily see in 30 years is... humanoids and other robots just being a complete part of our environment,\" Dawson said. \nAlso likely is \"people using their thoughts to control the world around them, even to use their thoughts to communicate directly with other people.\"\nDawson foresees a future not with flying cars per se, but rather self-driving pods -- a cheaper and safer alternative.\nOne thing that the movie got wildly wrong: lawyers have not been \"abolished\".\n\"I think a lot of people wished that had come true,\" quipped Uldrich -- but then who will settle disputes between humans and robots in the future?\n\nTechnology & Electronics Arts & Entertainment Marty McFly", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:22:17.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
