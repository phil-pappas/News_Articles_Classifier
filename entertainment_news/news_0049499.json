'The Other Woman' actress was caught up by the rare storm in Los Angeles on Saturday night. While leaving from The Nice Guy, the actress was stepping into her car with husband, Benji Madden holding her hand. \nHowever, her pumps slipped in the wet floor and she ended up slipping over. \nWhile crossing the sidewalk to enter inside the Uber, Cameron Diaz slipped outside The Nice Guy in West Hollywood. \nLuckily, her knight in shining armour which is none other than her husband, Benji Madden came to the rescue and saved her from facing the worst and getting hurt. \nThe 36-year-old dotting husband held Cameron from behind and helped her stand back on her feet. \nCameron looked gorgeous and bright in a leopard print shift dress. Benji, who showed off a new head tattoo, looked dapper in black. \nThe date night might have been romantic but Cameron's tripping was a little embarrassing for the 'Annie' star. However, Benji like a true gentleman was at her aid to help her get back and enter inside the car.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T12:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:12:40.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
