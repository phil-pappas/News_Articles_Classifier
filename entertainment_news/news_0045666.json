I saw this person taken by police from Studio 54 in handcuffs tonight. Never a dull moment on 54th Street! http://t.co/P3m0ZwNFbo \n— Jennifer Tepper (@jenashtep) October 2, 2015 \nIt is the same location where actor Shia LaBeouf was handcuffed during a performance of Cabaret for yelling obscenities in 2014. \nJessica Johnson, who represents the Roundabout Theatre Company, said the safety of actors and audiences is taken very seriously and extra security would be added starting today (October 2).
