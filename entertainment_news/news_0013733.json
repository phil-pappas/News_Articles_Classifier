This comes following a round of pictures of him looking bloated while smoking a cigarette surfaced last week. \n“Body-shaming is always wrong,” Diesel wrote, posting a photo of himself looking muscular in a black T-shirt and jeans. \nBut always the showman, Diesel followed that up with a second photo that showed off the abs. “For those who wanted the show... For all the angels that love dad bod regardless.” A photo posted by Vin Diesel (@vindiesel) on Oct 11, 2015 at 11:49am PDT Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T20:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:54:18.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
