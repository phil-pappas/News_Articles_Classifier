What happened next, as well as an account of the events that led up to it, is explained in Petits 2002 memoir To Reach the Clouds and in James Marshs Oscar-winning 2008 documentary Man on Wire. The book and the documentary are terrific. The Walk, Robert Zemeckis new dramatized telling of the tale is even better. The film opens with a bang, or rather, a shout. Theres Philippe Petit (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), joyously and loudly welcoming viewers to partake in his story, then telling that story, while perched on the torch at the top of the Statue of Liberty, with New York City and its glorious Twin Towers stretching and looming behind him. Let me mention right away: The film makes it OK to see the towers again, and not feel a tug of sadness. Not necessarily because enough time has passed, but because theyre such cool, compelling characters in the story. Petits story begins with flashbacks in (mostly) black and white, to a year earlier, when he was eking by as a juggler and low wire walker passing the hat in Paris. A painful (but funny) food-related accident results in a visit to a dentist where, in a classic right time-right place event, he picks up a magazine and sees an artists rendering of the then under-construction World Trade Towers, and his goal in life becomes clear. He simply must walk a wire between them. The fast-paced storytelling has the excitable Petit meeting the excitable circus man  and former high wire artist  Papa Rudy (Ben Kingsley, in an over-the-top but nuanced performance) and convincing him to teach him how to rig and walk a wire properly. Soon after, Petit meets, and annoys, another Paris street performer, folksinger Annie Allix (Charlotte Le Bon), but it doesnt take long for them to become an item and for her to become his first accomplice in achieving his dream. There will be others joining his team, but Petit knows that he needs to challenge himself more before he takes on the biggest buildings in Manhattan. His first public practice session, or as he puts it, his first surprise illegal high wire walk, was between the towers at Notre Dame, which gathered the notice of throngs of early-rising French folks. But soon its time, again, in Petits words, to do his coup. He makes his way to New York, and as he first approaches one of the towers, Zemeckis camera goes zooming up the side of the gleaming building, from the ground to the roof, in one smooth take. Its a brilliant visual rush, provided by cinematographer Dariusz Wolski. And its just one small portion of an ample supply of stunning visuals that fill the film. Zemeckis has shown us the impossible before, from Tom Hanks playing blindingly fast Ping-Pong in Forrest Gump to Denzel Washington flying a plane upside down in Flight. This time he makes us believe, with Wolskis and his effects teams help, that the Twin Towers are there, that were on top of them with Petit, and that hes actually walking between them above Lower Manhattan. The film will work in regular 2D, but a3D IMAX presentation is the way to go: If youre not good with heights, this one could give you a bit of vertigo. If youre tired of the 3D gimmick, dont worry, Zemeckis throws caution to the wind here, and makes it fun to watch. Page 2 of 2 - Theres plenty of drama and suspense before the walk, as Petit and his accomplices deal with snag after snag and close call after close call. Moving the necessary equipment way up there, then getting the steel cable across to the second tower, without being noticed by authorities, is a story in itself. As is Gordon-Levitt, who is incredibly graceful in his movements, and completely believable playing a passionate, driven, fearless, egotistical, probably crazy man. Its also nice that his Petit speaks in both perfect French (with subtitles) and heavily accented English. The first 90 minutes of the two-hour film is a tense and exciting and often funny buildup to Petits coup. Then the walk begins, and things get really interesting. His feat and this film are two amazing accomplishments. One was a crowd-pleaser then, the other is now.
