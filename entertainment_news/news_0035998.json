When she makes an ill-considered munchies run to a convenience store, however, Justine finds herself menaced by a stranger named Violet (Ashley Greene, the \"Twilight\" movie series) and her thuggish accomplices in this 2014 thriller. Mathew St. Patrick (\"Six Feet Under\") also stars.\n9 p.m., STARZ: Blunt Talk — Never one to miss any event that celebrates his sterling combat history, Walter (Patrick Stewart) commemorates the 33rd anniversary of the end of the Falklands War by throwing a truly epic bash in a new episode called \"I Brought a Petting Goat.\"\n10 p.m., BBC AMERICA: The Last Kingdom — The new \"Episode Two\" finds Uhtred (Alexander Dreymon) and his best friend, Brida (Emily Cox), on the run from his treacherous Saxon uncle, Aelfric (Joseph Millson). Accused of a ghastly wedding massacre that claimed most of his surrogate Danish family, Uhtred unsuccessfully pleads his innocence to the warlord Ubba (Rune Temte), but ultimately is forced to return to his Saxon roots and approach Alfred (David Dawson), who is about to be crowned king. \n10 p.m., HBO: Amy Schumer: Live at the Apollo — In her first HBO stand-up special, the Emmy- and Peabody Award-winning comic regales an audience at one of New York’s most iconic theaters with unfiltered, self-effacing and usually fairly raunchy stories about her life. Schumer is going to have a hard time sustaining the \"self-effacing\" part of that formula much longer, though.\n11:29 p.m., NBC: Saturday Night Live — Though Tracy Morgan made his first public appearance — following a devastating highway accident — at the most recent Emmy Awards, it’s a big event and a sign of how much he wants to get back to work for former cast regular to return to \"SNL\" as the guest host of this new episode. Demi Lovato is the musical guest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:37:43.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
