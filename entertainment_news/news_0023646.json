James Wan, who directed Fast & Furious 7, is currently unavailable to take charge of the new film because he is busy with horror sequel The Conjuring 2, while Fast & Furious 6’s Justin Lin is working on Star Trek Beyond.\n“Ultimately, we all want the best film to honour what we have created and what you the audience has adopted as your favourite franchise,” continued Diesel. “I will leave this matter in the studio’s hands for a moment while I release The Last Witch Hunter and start production of the long awaited [xXx sequel] ‘Xander Returns’.”\nLast week, Diesel confirmed studio Universal had given the go-ahead to three more films in the franchise , which, so far, has taken more than $3.8bn globally.\nThe Hollywood Reporter claims studio execs are none too happy about Diesel’s post . The trade bible Quote: s an inside source as follows: “It is never going to happen.” It is understood the action star does retain a veto over the choice of director, but is not in a position to simply install himself in the role.\nThis article was written by Ben Child, for theguardian.com on Friday 2nd October 2015 14.50 Europe/London guardian.co.uk © Guardian News and Media Limited 2010", "external_links": ["http://gu.com/p/4dx2t", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/4658593/04-noNetworks-noAdsense-mpu&sz=300x250&t=vertical%3Dhome&mob=js&c=", "https://www.facebook.com/VinDiesel?fref=ts", "http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/03/01/poweredbyguardian.png", "http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/28/vin-diesel-fast-and-furious-more-films-franchise", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/4658593/04-noNetworks-noAdsense-mpu&sz=300x250&t=vertical%3Dhome&mob=js&c=", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/furious-8-star-vin-diesel-828610", "https://www.facebook.com/VinDiesel/photos/a.101465923312.101581.89562268312/10153762695208313/?type=3&theater"], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T14:29:18.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
