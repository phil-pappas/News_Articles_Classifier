I’d thought I’d be a good negotiator, but I ended up being given the mussels to buy - even after it was impossible to source mussels on the English side at that time of the day. \nJenny says she wasn't there to compete with other people, she just wanted to get her business plan to Lord Sugar \n“I don’t think Vana should have left the competition, but she was definitely concentrating more on the French half of the team. Elle should probably have gone home, because I don’t think she managed her half of the team well. \n“And I think the audience are going to be disappointed that I was fired, because I’m a really strong candidate.” \nDespite her sense that the cards did not fall her way, Jenny says now she wasn’t really bothered about the competition part of the show, she just wanted Lord Sugar to see her business plan. \n“I’m not interested in competing with all the other people, that’s not why I was there, perhaps that was my downfall.” \nSo, without Jenny to worry them in the next few weeks, who does she think has the makings of a winner this year? \n“Joseph,” she decides. “He’s blunt but in a good way. He put Richard in his place this week. And Scott is strong. Richard would be a success, whether he’s in this show or not.\" \nThere are now 15 candidates left in this year’s competition. Who do you think looks like they’re on their way to becoming a successful Apprentice?
