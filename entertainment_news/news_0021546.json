The explosions occurred minutes apart near Ankara's train station as people gathered for the rally organized by the country's public sector workers' trade union. The rally aimed to call for an end to the renewed violence between Kurdish rebels and Turkish security forces.

The attack comes weeks before Turkey's November 1 elections. Television footage from Turkey's Dogan news agency showed several people lying injured on the streets or being taken into ambulances. \"There was a massacre in the middle of Ankara,\" said Lami Ozgen, head of the Confederation of Public Sector Trade Unions, or KESK. \"Two bombs exploded in very short intervals.\" There was no immediate responsibility claim. A government official said authorities were investigating the blast. Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu called an emergency security meeting to discuss the attack. In July, a suicide bombing blamed on the Islamic State group killed 33 people in a town near Turkey's border with Syria.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T16:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:31:26.899+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
