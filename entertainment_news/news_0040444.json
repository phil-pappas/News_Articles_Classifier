This group is shrinking, and being replaced by another group that, while large, buys fewer tickets. \n\"People love us,\" says opera general director/president David B. Devan, \"but our subscription family is eroding.\" About the subscription model that has sustained Opera Philadelphia and most other groups, Devan says: \"As much as we want that to continue, it's not.\" \nIf it did not change the diversity of its offerings and the way it packages them, the opera company figured it would be back in crisis within several years. \nAnd so starting in 2017-18, it will bunch together many of its productions for the September festival, with three more productions between February and April 2018. Planned are a new American production of George Benjamin's Written on Skin , a co-production with the Curtis Institute of Leonard Bernstein's A Quiet Place , and Carmen . \nThe rationale is to cater to two types of arts consumers: festival goers who may want to binge on several productions within a short span, and traditional subscribers who can still assemble a package of festival offerings along with operas later in the season. \nOpera Philadelphia, a short train ride from the Metropolitan Opera and its 30-times-bigger budget, decided it had to be something other than a traditional four-masterpiece-per-year company - \"turning into a mini-Met was not a strategy that was going to hold water,\" says managing director Annie Burridge - and was encouraged when market research revealed that 20 percent of listeners for works like last spring's world premiere of Charlie Parker's Yardbird came to Philadelphia from more than 70 miles away. \nBurridge says she expects O17's 25 performances to draw as many as 35,000 people (including an estimated 15,000 who will hear The Magic Flute for free on Independence Mall). The festival is aimed at an opportune time in the city, just as the Fringe Festival is ending but before the traditional concert season is underway around the beginning of October. \nPackaging productions in a festival format allows the company to raise money around the idea of innovation, and the strategy appears to be working. The first several years will require a festival fund plus reserves of $15 million - $10 million of which is already committed from individuals and foundations. \nFor all its market research data and resulting strategies, the festival also achieves a number of artistic goals and innovations, says music director Corrado Rovaris. \"The fact that we are going to use many different venues allows us to give the audience the possibility to have completely different experiences. Even when you attend a standard repertoire opera like The Magic Flute at the Academy of Music, you will experience something unexpected, as Barrie Kosky's production is completely different from what we have seen so far,\" he says. \nA double bill at the Philadelphia Museum of Art dubbed War Stories pairs Monteverdi with a new work by Lembit Beecher, but, intriguingly, both works use period instruments. \"In one project, how many crossing worlds!\" says Rovaris. Using students in the writing of We Shall Not Be Moved shows that \"opera is not old and dusty, but it is something which is fresh, alive and connected directly with their world.\" \nIt's a matter of balance, this question of how to meet audiences where they are while doing something artistically viable, says board chairman Daniel K. Meyer. \"Opera is something you can't do in a vacuum,\" he says. \"The audience is the final part of the equation.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:37:15.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
