He follows his own drummer. But what makes him stand out from the entire galaxy of heroes is his ability to find the strength to persevere and endure in spite of immense pressure, while learning from anyone and anything that can add value. Though Darshan says he joined the film industry only to earn a livelihood, the actor has now become a symbol of heroism in Karnataka, shouldering the massive ‘burden’ of expectations from his fans. \nBut he is clear about one thing: he acts for his fans now and it is for them that he is always learning and unlearning. “I always try to give something new and be innovative with each film. I try my level best to entertain them and that’s the only reason for all the motivation that I have,” says the star, who reveals that he had to reinvent himself completely for Mr Airavatha, especially in terms of physical appearance for which he worked out to get a six pack for the first time. He will also be exploring various shades of human traits in the film. \n“The main reason behind the look is a hard core fan. He visits my house often and once asked me as to why people should watch Kannada cinema when they can get more entertainment in a Hindi film for the same ticket price. He meant to tell me that along with focusing on the film’s subject, it is also the hero who makes all the difference, especially with his personality. His point remained in my mind and when I realised that I could get that image makeover with Mr Airavatha, I did not think twice,” he says and adds that producer N Sandesh was completely game for any kind of experimentation. \nIn his various avatars -- as a farmer, auto driver and a police officer, Darshan asserts that the film can easily connect with any strata of the society. “Though it is a mass film, the various characters will connect with the audience. I had another avatar which was similar to a character of Kamal Haasan’s played in Indian, but that has been edited out,” says the actor. \nMr Airavatha will release on the same day as his previous film, Sarathee, which was a blockbuster. While he hopes to repeat history, Darshan tells those who feel threatened by other language films, “When you have a good movie, there is nothing to be worried about. Puli is also releasing along with Mr Airavatha and I enjoy being part of the competition.” \nBehind the scenes \nDarshan, while working for Mr Airavatha, had his pets around and loved chilling with them in between shots. “They were my stress-busters. I had Simba, Jhansi and Blackie with me most of the time during the shoot. Whenever I felt pressured on the sets, I would just spend time with them and relax,” he says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:58:33.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
