But when Paul F. Tomkins reveals that he's decided to cut out red meat after his brother's heart attack and a high cholesterol reading, things get pretty tense.\nW/Bob & Dave premieres on Netflix on November 13. Sadly, it will be very limited — with only four half-hour episodes and a one-hour \"making of\" special.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/n3IzgYrOJ88"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:15:50.783+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
