At a press conference held at the Civic Centre here, Goel showed photographs of open defecation allegedly taking place in nearly a dozen posh localities in municipal areas. ”(NDMC) Mayor Ravinder Gupta always tries to be in headlines without paying attention to growing insanitation and problems of open defecation by people even in posh localities of the municipal corporation,” Goel alleged. (Also Read: Transport Department deploying imposters on roads to collect money:PIL) The BJP-ruled corporation has “done little” to make the ‘Swachh Bharat’ mission, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year, a success in its area, he said. ”Even after a lapse of one year of the Mission, I could not find out any difference in sanitation situation in the area under the jurisdiction of the municipal corporation,” he claimed. Goel further alleged the Central government of not paying the fund it had announced for the municipal corporations in the city under the Mission, adding that “it seemed NDMC has not even utilised the funds by Delhi government to improve sanitation.” Image credit: Facebook \n  8:03 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T17:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:19:23.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
