She is currently in prison after pleading guilty to tax charges. \nSorrentino and brother Marc have pleaded not guilty to charges they filed bogus tax returns on nearly $9 million and claimed millions in personal expenses as business expenses. \nSorrentino's first attorney withdrew in August, saying Sorrentino failed to pay his bills. A trial isn't expected before December. \nSorrentino appeared on all six seasons of MTV's \"Jersey Shore,\" which followed the lives of a group of young Italian-Americans. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T02:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:59:02.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
