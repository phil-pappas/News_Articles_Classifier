In a statement issued through Crown, the artist said he would describe the \"struggle for individual freedom and self-expression in this old society.\" \nAi often uses his work to draw attention to injustices in China. He also played a key role in designing the \"Bird's Nest\" Beijing National Stadium ahead of the 2008 Olympics, a project he later said he regretted.
