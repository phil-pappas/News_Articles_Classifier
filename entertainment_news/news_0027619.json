The local quartet will join Nate Bott (John), Axel Clarke (Ringo), Jesse Wilder (George) and Chris Paul Overall (Paul) for the songs “Eleanor Rigby,” “Yesterday,” “A Day in the Life,” “Hello Goodbye” and “Hey Jude.” \nIn addition to playing with Bellingham High’s Chamber Orchestra, the school’s most advanced orchestra, the quartet members have competed at the Washington Music Educators Association Solo and Ensemble Competition, earning a “superior” score with their chamber orchestra. \nHere’s more about Smith, a violist, and her love for music. \nQuestion: When did you become seriously interested in music? \nAnswer: When I was in elementary school I would sing in talent shows and perform in small plays or musicals. But in fifth grade, at Geneva Elementary School, I decided to instead take up a string instrument in my elementary school’s strings program. The violin was my first instrument, but in sixth grade I switched to viola, preferring the deeper, richer tone. \nWe’ve had a blast throughout the process of rehearsing together and completing interviews, and can’t wait to perform on Oct. 23. Madeline Smith, Bellingham High violist \nLast year I had the opportunity to perform in the pit orchestra for Bellingham High School’s production of “The Music Man.” I didn’t allow the lack of a viola part to stop me from being involved in the districtwide performance; I adjusted to reading in treble clef and played along with the violin section. \nQ: What have been some of your favorite memories about performing? \nA : Playing in the pit for “The Music Man” was one of my favorite performance experiences because our music helped bring the musical to life. Though music has a life of its own, seeing it contribute to an actual story was an incredible experience. \nQ: Why do you enjoy performing? \nA: I love performing because a musician shares an experience with the listeners, particularly in the BHS Chamber Orchestra, since the group has such a close bond each year. We’re all friends outside of school, and our emotions and connections to one another are expressed through the music. \nThis fall, I am playing with the North Sound Youth Symphony with my BHS stand partner, Chase Travers, and other young musicians. \nQ: What kind of music do you enjoy performing? \nA: I love performing and listening to music that is either familiar to me and evokes nostalgia, such as the music in our upcoming Beatles show, or music that uses a range of tempos and keys to convey different emotions. Though I can appreciate statically exciting and upbeat music or, conversely, slower, more dramatic pieces, I prefer performing songs with a mixture of both because the variety keeps the piece intriguing for both the audience and me as a performer. \nI’m thrilled to be presented with the opportunity to perform with my fellow BHS musicians in the upcoming “In My Life” show. We’ve had a blast throughout the process of rehearsing together and completing interviews, and can’t wait to perform on Oct. 23. \nQ: What are your future plans? \nA: After graduation this spring, I hope to attend a university to double major in Spanish and early education, so that I can teach English to younger children whose native language is Spanish. I hope to continue with music wherever my future leads me. \nReach Margaret Bikman at 360-715-2273 or margaret.bikman@bellinghamherald.com .
