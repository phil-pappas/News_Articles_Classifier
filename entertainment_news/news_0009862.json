Swift released her album of the same name in October 2014, and will bring her accompanying seven-month tour to a close Dec. 12 in Melbourne, Australia.\n\"I think I should take some time off [afterward],\" she told the publication. \"I think people might need a break from me. I'm going to... I don't know. Hang out with my friends. Write new music. Maybe not write new music. I don't know.\"\nIn addition to her hectic schedule, the busy pop star admitted her life in the spotlight can also wear her down. Swift surpassed 50 million followers on Instagram this week, and her every word and move are subject to the public eye.\n\"I'm in the news every single day for multiple different reasons,\" she said. \"And it can feel, at times, if you let your anxiety get the better of you, like everybody's waiting for you to really mess up -- and then you'll be done.\"\n\"A lot of the time I need to call my mom and talk for a really long time, just to remind myself of all the things that are great and all the things that matter,\" she shared. \"If you do something that defines your character to be not what the public thought you were, that's the biggest risk.\"\nSwift started recording music at age 14, and released her debut studio album, Taylor Swift , at 16 in 2006. The singer is known for such hits as \"Love Story,\" \"I Knew You Were Trouble\" and \"Bad Blood,\" as well as her high-profile friendships with Karlie Kloss and Selena Gomez .\n Taylor Swift breaks 50M followers on Instagram, beats Justin Bieber Taylor Swift graces cover of GQ in skin-tight beachwear Taylor Swift addresses engagement rumors on Twitter Taylor Swift gives $50,000 to help dancer's baby nephew fight cancer", "external_links": ["http://www.nme.com/features/taylor-swift-power-fame-and-the-future-the-full-nme-cover-interview", "https://facebook.com/unitedpress", "https://www.facebook.com/UnitedPress"], "published": "2015-10-09T21:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:52:56.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
