But that certainly hasn't stopped the actress from taking on some very convincing hardcore characters. \nWho could forget her snobbish, no-nonsense attitude as Meryl Streep’s assistant in The Devil Wears Prada, or the tough-as-nails soldier Sgt. Rita Vrataski opposite Tom Cruise in last year's Edge of Tomorrow ? Now, Blunt is showcasing her tough side again, this time by playing FBI Agent Kate Macer in the new big-screen action drama, Sicario . In the movie, she’s jumping off of buildings and battling a drug cartel. \n\"I’m not very tough. I get very nervous,\" Blunt admitted to ABC News . \"I would never, ever take a bike ride without a helmet. I do think innately I have a bit of a showoff mentality when it comes to doing physical things. Maybe it brings me back to being a child on sports day and trying to win the race.\" \nBlunt said she's careful about choosing her film roles because it’s easy to become typecast. It almost happened after The Devil Wears Prada was such a huge hit. \n\"With Devil Wears Prada, I think I got offered every acerbic bitchy British character on the market for the next two years. And I just made a point of just not doing that ever. And then after Edge of Tomorrow, I got offered every action film. So you’ve got to be careful so as not to get categorized,\" she explained. \nA British native who recently became a U.S. citizen, Blunt also has links to the royal family. \"We’re best friends. We’re really close,\" Blunt joked of the relationship. \n\"My grandfather was quite high up in the army so he had some ties with the royal family. So, when my oldest sister presented a bouquet to the Queen Mother, I was there too,\" she explained. \"And I had this horrible, disgusting stinking toy that every child is in love with, you know and I thrust it into her face apparently to give her a sniff. And apparently she went, ‘Oh yes, I can see he’s well loved.' It’s my claim to royal fame.\" \nSicario is in theaters now. Copyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
