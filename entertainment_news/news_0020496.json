I understand.' It's a different type of overwhelming with the second. I really got under the cloud.\" \nThe actress is mother to 3-year-old Olive and 18-month-old Frankie with husband Will Kopelman. \nBarrymore said during her depression she most struggled with work-life balance. And it may explain why she turned down a lot of movie roles over the last few years. \n\"I just got right on the idea of, where do I need to be the most? Fifty-fifty would be ideal but life doesn't work like that. Life is messy,\" Barrymore said. \"It was just really challenging and I felt overwhelmed. I made a lot of decisions and I definitely changed my work life to suit my parenthood.\" \n\"It's really important,\" she continued. \"I was in the kids' class with Frankie and Olive this morning and I started fretting about some piece of work news that was just stressful. You know, in like the Broadway Babies class and it's the one-hit wonders day, and they're singing I don't even know what song, and we're all doing our lollipop drums and I just thought, 'Save it until after class.' One thing at a time.\" \nBarrymore said a shift in how she viewed her work commitments helped her. \"Putting a negative stigma on work is a go-to. It makes us feel like it proves to our children that we don't want to work, we'd rather be with you. I want them to see that work can be a good, positive, fun, happy thing,\" she clarified. \"I've worked since I was 11-and-a-half months old so I have to be able to work, too. But I have to put them first. I don't know if it's good enough for anyone but I'm doing my best.\" \nBarrymore's revelation comes after Nashville star Hayden Panettiere opened up about her own struggle with postpartum depression since the birth of her daughter Kaya last December. The actress entered treatment for it earlier this month. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
