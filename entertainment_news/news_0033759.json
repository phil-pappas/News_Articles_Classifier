We see her when she is on Krypton and then we'll also see her in hologram. And then there is another thing that I can't tell you that's a spoiler, but it's what sealed the deal.\" \nBecoming a hologram looks cool, Benanti admits, but filming it was \"the most unnatural, weird\" experience, she says. \"You're just standing there, talking directly into a camera -- which you never do -- with all of the crew just standing around. And you have to imagine the camera is a person,\" she adds. \nBenanti says she wanted to be part of this cast although she \"was never like a comic book person.\" \n\"I'm excited to be part of this because not only is our heroine a woman, but the villains as well,\" she explains. \"I like the idea of bringing a female perspective and a female rockin' girl vibe to something that has been typically masculine.\" \nBenanti tells ABC Radio she hopes the show breaks down sexism in the comic book world, adding that the industry can sometimes feel like a \"boy zone.\" \nSupergirl, with Melissa Benoist as the title character, premieres Monday. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
