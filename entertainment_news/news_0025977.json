His solo album, Matador, is more introspective and experimental than his Britpop band. \nOther artists nominated for the Â£20,000 prize include Florence + The Machine, Jamie xx and Wolf Alice. \nThe winner will be revealed live on BBC Four and BBC 6 Music next month. \nThere are only two bands in the shortlist, which leans heavily towards singer-songwriters making intimate, confessional music. \nBut bookmakers' favourites Everything Everything failed to secure a nomination, with other notable absentees including Blur, Laura Marling, Foals and New Order. Image caption Gaz Coombes is nominated for his second solo album, Matador \nThe full list of nominees: Aphex Twin - Syro Benjamin Clementine - At Least For Now Gaz Coombes - Matador Florence + The Machine - How Big How Blue How Beautiful ( pictured ) Ghost Poet - Shedding Skin Soak - Before We Forgot How To Dream Wolf Alice - My Love Is Cool Who is on the judging panel? \nAnalysis - Mark Savage: Music reporter \nThree singer-songwriters sit on the panel for this year's Mercury Prize, and their influence shows. The list favours solo artists making intimate, confessional albums. \nBenjamin Clementine, who has been called \"the male Nina Simone\" sings about his experiences of homelessness, while Florence + The Machine confronts her personal demons on what is (for her) a subtle, restrained record. \nOnly two bands make the shortlist - Slaves and Wolf Alice, who represent two opposing approaches to rock. The former are a spittle-flecked burst of raw aggression, while Wolf Alice are sonically adventurous, expansive and destined for an arena near you. \nAltogether, the 12 albums are of unusually high quality, and predicting a winner is a fool's errand - but my personal favourite is currently Eska Mtungwazi's beguiling, unpredictable debut, which pulls off the trick of being musically intricate while still sounding organic and free. \nEdinburgh-based hip-hop trio Young Fathers won last year's award, while other recent winners have included James Blake, Alt-J, PJ Harvey and The xx. \nThe prize is judged by a panel of 12 critics, DJs, musicians and other industry figures who often use the shortlist to champion left-field choices as well as more obvious contenders. \nAmong the less well-known acts this year are Benjamin Clementine, a British-Ghanaian singer who went from busking in Paris to being championed by Sir Paul McCartney, after a fortuitous appearance on BBC Two's Later... With Jools Holland. \nSoul-jazz musician Eska also makes the list with her self-titled debut record, after working as an arranger and session singer on three previous Mercury-nominated albums.

But I'm sure we'll crash and burn shortly.\" \nSeveral former nominees are on this year's judging panel, including Corinne Bailey Rae, Anna Calvi and Nick Mulvey, alongside a selection of music journalists and broadcasters. \nThey winner will receive their prize on 20 November, at a ceremony in the BBC's Radio Theatre in central London.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T14:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:26:54.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
