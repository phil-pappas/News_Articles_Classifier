In the game, the 8-bit-style Pizza Rat hops down the steps and your job as a player is to make sure it avoids discarded cans of PBR on its way down. \nThe game was the brainchild of North Brooklyn residents Chad Oâ€™Connell, 28, and Shloimy Notik, 27, who got web developer and Queens resident Jonathan Cherlin, 31 to design the game. \n\"Once we saw Pizza Rat lugging that slice down the stairs we fell in love with his struggle,\" O'Connell told DNAinfo in an email. \nIf you make it to the final level of the game, Donald Trump appears, O'Connell said. The player is then challenged to get the slice over Trump's voluminous hair. \nPizzaRat is also getting air time on television. On Saturday night, the rodent got the ultimate benediction of meme-dom when \"Saturday Night Live\" included the viral vermin in its roundup of people and things that grabbed headlines this summer during guest Miley Cyrus' opening monologue. \nThe #PizzaRat, played in the sketch by Keenan Thompson, stood in infamy next to actors playing Kim Davis, Rachel Dolezal and Jared Fogel, among others. \nCan't get enough of Pizza Rat in your life?
