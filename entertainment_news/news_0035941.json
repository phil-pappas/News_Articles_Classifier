In other parts of the world, the article notes that sales were driven by emerging markets such as China and India, whose upper-class population segments are becoming increasingly affluent and more able to make diamond jewelry purchases. While this increase is a good sign for the diamond jewelry industry, Los Angeles Diamond retailer Louis Saint Dupont notes that jewelers must respond to this news by ensuring that the quality of their pieces is high enough to meet the expectations of both new and long-time diamond jewelry buyers. Louis Saint Dupont notes that, rather than slacking off when sales become easier, they work harder to ensure that their pieces are up to the highest standards possible in order to make buyers comfortable in the knowledge they are getting amazing value out of their diamond jewelry. To ensure these strong sales continue, Louis Saint Dupont notes that they and their competitors must offer customers pieces using only the finest diamonds, and the most elegant and unique settings.\nThe Diamond – Louis Saint Dupont explains that they use only responsibly sourced Canadian diamonds for their pieces, and they also try to make sure that they sell the highest quality GIA rated diamonds possible. They explain that Canadian diamonds are very popular with customers because they have all of the beauty they expect without any of the worry that the diamond could have been mined in a conflict area. In addition, they say that the GIA certification makes it easy for shoppers to look at an objective evaluation of each piece to ensure that they are getting a fantastic deal. The Setting – While often given second billing, the setting is an incredibly important aspect of each piece of diamond jewelry, as it is the component that often allows the jewelry to express its own originality, artistry, and style. Louis Saint Dupont notes that, in addition to more traditional settings for gorgeous, diamond wedding rings sets, they also provide shoppers with the option of choosing truly breathtaking pieces from the most sought-after designer collections.\nWhile Louis Saint Dupont’s selection is constantly changing as pieces are bought and sold, they assure that customers can always expect consistency in the quality of each individual piece.
