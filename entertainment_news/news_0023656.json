Yes, you read me right.\nExpect colourful language and such an imaginative use of expletives that the Kiis FM censor may be rushed off her feet as potentially one of the great radio feuds of Sydney gets under way. (Even if it is mostly one-sided).\nIt’s no secret that Sandilands has a thing about McManus, who has just been announced to take over the breakfast spot on 2Day FM from Dan Debuf and Maz Compton of the Dan & Maz Show.\nAnd the media identity is receiving a far from small-scale pay packet, including a $2.1 million share offering, although this is just peanuts when compared to the $10 million deal that Sandilands and Jackie Henderson earn at the Australian Radio Network.\n“Sydney needs a big show, with a big name and it doesn’t get much bigger than Rove,” Southern Cross Austereo’s Head of Operations, Guy Dobson, gushed in a statement on Tuesday.\n“We have a superb plan in place to make sure that the new show is everything you’d expect from one of Australia’s greatest entertainers.\n “But why would we tell you everything now? We’re holding some of the show-and-tell for later. Watch this space, all will be revealed very soon.”\nKyle Sandilands and Jackie Henderson scored a $10 million deal at the Australian Radio Network. One can only imagine Kyle Sandiland’s reaction when he learned of this.\nHe must have been in danger of spitting out his mouthful of Diet Coke all over his famous gold mic.\nJust the thought of McManus easing himself behind the desk in the studio, once occupied by Kyle & Jackie O when 2Day FM was leading the ratings, may have been enough to set him off.\nMcManus is Sandilands’ nemesis (and as someone who briefly held that title several years ago, I can tell you that it’s not a comfortable place to be).\nSydney needs a big show, with a big name and it doesn’t get much bigger than Rove\nKing Kyle is not one to hold back on juicy phrases. Back in 2011, he called McManus “a piece of shit and an arsehole” and that is when he was being mildly complimentary.\nMeanwhile, McManus has always insisted that he had no feud with Sandilands.\n“For there to be rivalry it would have to go two ways and it’s just from him. I have no feeling either way, I just don’t get it,” he said after one onslaught.\nSandilands’ dislike of McManus goes all the way back to the time when he was married to pop singer Tamara Jaber and the media identity joined in the chorus of people who accused him of nepotism for continually playing Jaber’s records.\nDespite later attempts at starting out fresh with McManus, it all fell in a heap again.\n“He was an arsehole to me and Tamara on his TV show. Everyone thinks he’s cookies and cream when he’s a little prick — he’s a little arsehole,” Sandilands lamented back then.\nEven the least insightful media commentator could safely predict it’s not going to be pretty between the two.\nRove McManus is a triple award winning Australian Gold Logie award winning television presenter, producer, comedian and media personality. Picture: David Caird. However getting an update from Sandilands on his current thoughts has proved to be mission impossible. Despite having warmly told his listeners just a few months ago, that he “always has time to chat” to me, he ignored my valiant attempts to get him on the line.\nI also sought him out at his favourite Double Bay cafe but alas his table was vacant.\n“At this stage Kyle has not commented on Rove at all to anyone,” said a Kiis FM spokesman, “and as of this morning, he is not sure that he will.”\nJust like Guy Dobson, Sandilands is not giving anything away.\nBut surely all it will take is one less than impressive radio survey from McManus, to have him crowing into that golden mic.\nMcManus’s new role is a certainly a curious one because it seems like a backward step for him to attempt to be king of the kids again on FM radio.\nEven when it comes to celebrity interviews on air, Sandilands and Henderson will be hard to beat because of their unique style: Henderson asks interesting questions while Sandilands can be as excitable and as enthusiastic as a fan when interviewing the stars.\nBut they both come across as authentic. McManus on the other hand seems quite tightly wound as if he is always looking for that opening for his punchline instead of waiting to see what the other person has to say.\nIt may all depend on the rest of his team at 2Day FM but one thing’s sure, it’s Sandilands’ ribald comments about McManus that will get the attention on the airwaves.\nGUESS WHO DON’T SUE\nWHICH Aussie identity in LA was initially being paid peanuts, a rumoured $800 per episode, for a breakout role?\nWHOSE hot relationship will probably result in a disengagement before any diamond ring is selected. It’s all about the bloke’s commitment problem.\nWHICH Aussie celebrity was couch surfing in LA with a same-sex couple who were really too polite to question their connection to him. Each thought the other was his good buddy. Turns out that neither was.\nWHICH television personality likes to visit professional working gals who will indulge his fetish to be babied? But never in Sydney — he waits until he goes interstate to don the diapers.\nWHICH upstanding eastern suburbs lawyer made quite the impact sailing up the Parramatta river to attend the NRL grand final? But it wasn’t his natty scarf and matching socks that made the impact but the fact that Sydney’s most famous groom, Salim Mehajer, was also on board the vessel.", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/84bbff6ab76cdb152e1bfacba74aca51", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/67c34669e73877929ae945a74c0607e5?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/661d28ba08499db58de471efcb975ce8", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e0ecc9764913631058b7c705f58abf7d", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/66fa58f3fe82a85da51248d48a4fa31a", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ea6ca1a98282e6bba934db59ccd98576", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/7f9c8d60468fee74cfd347f61cd6227b", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/8ed6f58120a173246dc57c84b21dc921?width=650", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-10-10T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:04:20.108+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
