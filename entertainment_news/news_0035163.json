Presiding over a review meeting to monitor the pace of these projects here, Badal underscored the need for expediting the work on these projects so that they could be completed within the stipulated time period. He said that these three iconic projects – Jang-e-Azaadi, War Heroes Memorial and Ram Tirath Temple – were of significance for the country in general and state in particular, as each one of them has its own cultural and historical relevance. Badal said that the state-of-the-art Museum-cum-Panorama center was coming up at Sri Valmiki Tirath in Amritsar, where Bhagwan Valmikiji had created the great epic and masterpiece of Ramayana. (Also Read: Supreme Court notice to Virbhadra Singh in disproportionate assets case) The CM said that it was a matter of great pride and honour for the state government to offer humble tributes to Bhagwan Valmikiji by developing this site at a cost of Rs 180 crore for the devotees visiting this sacred place from every nook and corner of the world. He said the new Temple which would be constructed at Sri Valmiki Ashram (Ram Tirath) would be an engineering marvel spruced with rare architecture, landscaping besides aesthetically designed. “This Temple will be unique monument in the sense that it will not only help in disseminating the philosophy of Bhagwan Valmiki for carving out a harmonious society in the state, but it would also act as a lighthouse to guide the destiny of our youth through the great ethical and moral values preached by him,” he added. Reviewing the work of Jang-e-Azaadi memorial at Kartapur near Jalandhar, the CM said that this project coming up a cost of Rs 250 crore would showcase the sacrifices made by the Punjabis in the national freedom struggle. He categorically said that there was no dearth of funds for these ambitious projects as the state government was duty- bound to perpetuate the glorious history of Punjab for the coming generations. The CM also directed the officers to expedite the construction work on Punjab War Heroes Museum being constructed by the state government in Amritsar to highlight the sacrifices made by the Punjabis in Armed forces and showcase the gallantry spirit of Punjab. This project was coming up in the holy city at a cost of Rs 130 crore, he said. Badal asked the officers to strictly monitor the ongoing works so that timely completion of these projects could be ensured. \nModified Date: October 26, 2015 5:05 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T13:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:20:26.319+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
