Rough cut (no reporter narration) ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript \nROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) STORY: Around 800 lots from the iconic films of Sylvester Stallone will change hands at auction in December. Included in the sale are props and costumes from Stallone's most famous roles such as Rocky, Rambo and Barney Ross from \"the Expendables\" series. On Tuesday (October 20), Heritage Auctions put some of the most recognizable pieces on public display in New York. \"Imagine the thrill of being able to own Rocky Balboa's boxing gloves, or John Rambo's army jacket,\" said Donn Pearlman, spokesman of the auction house. \"Fans now will have an opportunity because Mr. Stallone wanted to be able [to give] the fans this opportunity and also to help some worthy causes.\" Stallone pledged to donate a portion of the proceeds to charities that assist veterans and wounded United States servicemen. Among the top lots is a pair of boxing gloves and a championship belt that Stallone wore on-screen in \"Rocky II.\" Another top lot is the handwritten script of the original \"Rocky\" film that Stallone penned in a notebook. \"This is a simple notebook that in 1975 propelled Sylvester Stallone to international stardom,\" Pearlman said. \"The particular page that we have open here is where he comes up with the dialogue for 'the Italian Stallion.' This notebook probably will sell for well over $150,000 dollars (USD).\" John Rambo's army jacket from \"First Blood\" and Rocky Balboa's yellow trunks worn in \"Rocky III\" are each expected to fetch around $20,000. For many other lots the auction house did not have an estimate yet as they were still in the process of getting catalogued. The two-day public viewing had Stallone fans flocking to New York from near and far. The auction will be held in Los Angeles and online from December 18th until 20th. Fans can see the top lots in person in New York on October 20th until 21st.
