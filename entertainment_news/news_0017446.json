Stage 4, meaning it has spread from the primary lung site into lymph nodes. Clearly my body is staying true to my love for drama and theatrics because a blood clot has also decided to hang out in the heart muscle. Doctors have called it 'organized' - yaani it's fixed in the muscle with little chance of moving so I'm safe from that. We can focus on treating the cancer. \nIt has taken me weeks to decide to publicly admit that this is the diagnosis. One reason is that it is not advised to give voice to sickness. What you declare is what is. However I realize that discussing this condition over the past 3 and half months has helped people - those with similar symptoms, those with other ailments and those who are affected by caring for the sick. I know that sickness is not my portion, and if by sharing my experience I can help to educate and comfort others, then so be it ,” reads part of her post. \nThe N-Soko presenter acknowledged the support of her family more so her husband and mother who have been with her in her medical journey. \nShe further explains the several procedures she has undergone while giving encouraging quotes from the Bible \n“ I do not claim to be the strongest spiritual person however I have learnt, and I'm still learning, to Be Still And Know That He Is God. He is the Lord that healeth me. He is not done with me yet. I remember the blind man in the Bible who Jesus said was not cursed but was born blind so that God's glory could be seen at work in him, just as it will be seen in me through my testimony. John 9:3 \"Neither this man nor his parents sinned,\" said Jesus, \"but this happened so that the works of God might be displayed in him.\" I remember the woman who touched Jesus cloak after years of bleeding and this faith healed her. I remember Job who was afflicted continuously, just when he thought it couldn't get any worse, it did. But he held onto his faith and beat the devil's plans. And so I will stand firm. There is too much evidence of miracles that have happened. God has already shown us favour in ways that might be considered small by some, but which make a big difference when you're a patient in a foreign land…. He is the Alpha and Omega. And as we successfully go through this season we begin to live at a higher level of wisdom and righteousness, with the Holy Spirit leading us all the way, all the time. Romans 12:2 \"Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is--his good, pleasing and perfect will.\" \nKenyans came out to encourage her in her battle against cancer through several comments as many prayed for her. \nJanet is currently in New Delhi where she has been undergoing her chemotherapy.
