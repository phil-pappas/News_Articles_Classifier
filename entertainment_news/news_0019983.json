Jones and Nion McEvoy Squaw Valley Community of Writers finds food in words 1  /  1 Back to Gallery This year’s Litquake Barbary Coast Award was bestowed Wednesday night on the Squaw Valley Community of Writers. The writers conference was founded in 1969 by novelists Oakley Hall and Blair Fuller and nonfiction writer David Perlman , science editor of The Chronicle . \nMost of the evening’s program, emceed by poet Matthew Zapruder , featured speeches and poems of tribute, augmented by the band Los Train Wreck, a fitting homage to the conference, where evenings often end with singing and playing music. (In the early days, they often ended with other recreational activities, too, said Perlman.)\nBut Squaw is about wordcraft: Poet-novelist Elizabeth Rosner described the valley setting, “a bowl inside a mountain range that held thousands as we walked, talked and ate words.” Novelist Amy Tan paid homage to late writers who’d participated and compared the experience of going to Squaw and learning whether your work is any good to glimpsing your face in a mirror after you’d been able to see only the back of your head. Sands Hall sang a love song from her album “Rustler’s Moon” because Squaw, it was said by several, is about not only writing but also love.\nThat’s not to say it was treacly. In keeping with poet Robert Hass ’ image of Oakley Hall with wineglass in hand, watching the action at the pearly gates, I am imagining Hall smiling at hearing his daughter, community executive director Brett Hall , carrying on both the day-to-day organization and the spirit of the gathering: “My father always said to me, ‘Try not to f— it up.’” \n\n•It’s not right to applaud a car accident, but one on Thursday night, Oct. 15, on the Golden Gate Bridge wound up having a positive effect for music-loving baseball fans. The resulting traffic tie-up, report Audrey and Bob Sockolov , delayed the Symphony opening for 20 minutes. That “gave us time to cheer the Mets on. ... The game ended at the start of the overture.”\n•Meanwhile, at the de Young Museum on Thursday, Oct. 15, steam from a dim sum table serving station activated a fire alarm at the opening of “Jewel City,” art from the Panama-Pacific International Exposition. Guests went outside, firefighters arrived, guests returned, more dim sum was consumed.\n•The night before returning from New Orleans, where he’d attended a professional conference, designer Eric Heiman realized he’d mistakenly booked a flight a week away. He was on the phone in the hotel lobby dealing with this when a young woman approached, said, “I was told to give this to you,” and handed him a folded note with 200 Canadian dollars. \n“I overheard that your flight got messed up, or that something has caused you stress,” said the note. “I pray this will help you. It’s Canadian, so you’ll have to exchange it for American currency. Sorry about that. God bless.” His change-fee was more than covered by the gift ... and he promises to pay it forward.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T14:23:23.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
