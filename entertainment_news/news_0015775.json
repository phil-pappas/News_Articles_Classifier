She told the BBC he began to smell differently long before doctors identified him as a Parkinson's patient. Joy says his odor was subtle and she occasionally got whiffs of a musky smell.\nShe suspected his scent was associated with the disease when Les received his official diagnosis and the couple began socializing with other Parkinson's patients. She noticed they gave off the same smell as her husband.\nPhoto: Dr. Tilo Kunath Dr Tilo Kunath, a Parkinson's UK fellow at the school of biological sciences at Edinburgh University, is working with a woman who seems to have the ability to smell Parkinson's disease.\nDr Tilo Kunath, a Parkinson's UK fellow at the school of biological...\nScientists at Edinburgh University were intrigued by Joy's observations and put her nose to the test â€” and discovered that she seems to have the ability to sniff out Parkinson's.\nThe research team had six people with Parkinson's and six without wear a T-shirt for a day and put the worn garments in bags.\nJoy then used her acute sense of smell to identify who had Parkinson's and who didn't.\n\"Her accuracy was 11 out of 12,\" Dr. Tilo Kunath, a Parkinson's UK fellow at the school of biological sciences at Edinburgh University, told the BBC . \"We were quite impressed.\"\nAnd this is where the story becomes even more remarkable. The one person who Joy identified incorrectly began showing signs of the disease and was diagnosed eight months later.\nDr. Kunath and his team hope to use their findings to develop a test that identifies the disease using a swab that's run across a person's forehead.\nSome 60,000 Americans are diagnosed with Parkinson's each year in the United States, according to the Parkinson's Disease Foundation . Currently, a standard diagnostic test doesn't exist and diagnosis is determined by a physician taking a neurological history, performing an examination and considering the patient's symptoms.", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-34583642", "http://www.pdf.org/en/parkinson_statistics", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/10/8839688/9/920x1240.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:06:39.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
