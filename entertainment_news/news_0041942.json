Its perch more than 2,000 feet above the coastal city has made it a symbol of Christianity around the world. \nMonday's anniversary celebration included a birthday cake and the singing of \"Happy Birthday\" in Portuguese. \nCanadian tourist Karen Southerland says she didn't know Monday was the statue's anniversary, but was excited to be part of the celebration. \nSound: Upcoming", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T07:38:20.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
