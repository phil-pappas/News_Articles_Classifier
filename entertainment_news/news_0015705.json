But he also downplayed his participation. \n\"I know the real difference will be made in other rooms,\" he said. \"It's just an opportunity to talk about it . . I was invited to be a part of this so I take it seriously.\" \nThe Mi'kmaq and environmental groups want a 12-year moratorium on any potential drilling in the gulf. They say it will take that long to complete a proper and comprehensive environmental assessment of a bio-diverse area of the ocean. \n\"While Canada's thinking about drilling out there . . . we are telling them that they can't do it without talking to the Mi'kmaq,\" said Troy Jerome, executive director of the Mi’gmawei Mawiomi Secretariat. \nJerome said with a new Liberal government about to take power in Ottawa Canadians need to ask their MPs what they are doing about the gulf. \n\"Ethan Hawke is here doing something about the gulf, what are you (MPs) doing about the gulf?\" he said. \nJerome told a news conference that Atlantic petroleum boards are operating at pace where Nova Scotians don't feel they have a say about oil drilling. \nThe Gulf of St. Lawrence is one of the largest marine breeding regions in Canada with more than 2,000 marine species. \nThe area is home to endangered whales and is also home to a lucrative lobster fishery.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T22:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:21:38.336+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
