Finance, MarketWatch and many others.\nWashington DC October 2 2015 – A feature story about Zachary Jenkins was recently seen on Reuters as well as the other major online publications such as CNBC.com, Boston.com, Yahoo! Finance, Washington Business Journal, and MarketWatch, among many others.\nZachary Jenkins is a living embodiment of the Army slogan: “be all you can be.” This attributes to his drive to succeed to the discipline of his time in the military – which included training as a parachutist at Ft. Benning, GA and in Germany while arranging supplies for those who went to fight in the Gulf War\nFor the past 13 years, he has worked as a U.S. Department of Justice Financial Specialist by day, primarily processing vendor payments for thousands of small businesses contracted by the government; his current position is Certifying Officer for USDOJ and Team Lead. While rising in the ranks and helping business owners get paid in an efficient manner, Jenkins has also thrived for many years in various vending, wholesale and retail businesses on a part time basis.\nJenkins enjoys success as a DOJ financial analyst and as a serial entrepreneur, but these are only two facets of an incredible personal and professional life journey. Serving as preparation for his future career with the DOJ, he received on the job training in finance and accounting during his later Army stint in South Korea. His position there was in Fleet Management, arranging for thousands of vehicles to be shipped to different parts of the country.\nReflecting upon his eclectic resume as a serviceman, government employee and entrepreneur, Jenkins says, “Everything I do boils down to helping people every day. I want to bring something of value to people that brings joy to their day and enhances their life.”\nThe full text of the feature story about Zachary that was seen on Yahoo!
