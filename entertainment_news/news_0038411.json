There's buzz that the movie will be partly set in 1979, with another actor playing a young McLane and Willis, 60 , reprising his famous role in present-day scenes. \nThe first \"Die Hard\" film was a blockbuster hit in 1988. \"Die Hard 2\" followed in 1990. Then there was \"Die Hard with a Vengeance\" (1995), \"Live Free or Die Hard\" (2007), and \"A Good Day to Die Hard\" (2013). \nWillis, who moved to Bedford with his wife and children last year, has not commented on the recent report. He has been preparing for his first Broadway role in the upcoming stage adaptation of Stephen King's \"Misery.\" \nPhoto: Getty", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:53:48.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
