However, the parcel was expanded six-fold in recent years. Brennan says Lindemann is buying the original 5.7-acre compound but not the rest of the property. \nWarhol, who died in 1987, entertained celebrity guests like Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis there in the 1970s. \nThe chairman and chief executive of the J. Crew Group, Mickey Drexler, bought it in 2007. \nLindemann's attorney says the closing should occur by the end of the year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:43:41.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
