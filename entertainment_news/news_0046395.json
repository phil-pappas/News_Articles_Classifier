He had grown up in a home without books, so he never read the Alice stories or saw the Tenniel pictures. Then in 1956 he listened to a talking book of Alice in Wonderland , which his wife Barbara, who had been legally blind since 1950, had borrowed from the blind library.\n\"I was absolutely thrilled to bits with it,\" he said in a 1973 radio interview with Robert Peach. \"It seemed to sum up for me at that particular moment my feelings towards surrealism, and that anything could happen ... The world is a very magical and possible place for all one's dreams and feelings.\"\nFor Barbara, as quoted by Felicity St John Moore, \"Alice was moving enquiringly, questioningly, trustfully, bemusedly, changefully, into a new and strange world, trying with good sense and honesty to get her bearings in it, however often she seemed to change body shape and whereabouts.\" The \"new and strange world\" was both Barbara Blackman's blindness and her body, for she was pregnant with their first child.\nBlackman took nine months – the length of Barbara's pregnancy – to paint 43 images of the growing, shrinking and floating Alice, the White Rabbit, and flowers, crockery and furniture from the couple's own house and from the restaurant where he worked. Sometimes Alice and the White Rabbit shifted and merged into each other.\nAdvertisement Another Australian artist, Donna Leslie, produced 33 original illustrations for perhaps the most unusual Alice book ever: Alitji in Dreamland: Alitjinya Ngura Tjukurmankuntjala (Simon and Schuster, 1992), a translation and reinterpretation of the story by Nancy Sheppard in English and Pitjantjatjara text which was first produced in 1968 for a course in the Aboriginal language at Adelaide University.\nLeslie, an artist and art historian at Griffith University, was inspired by the art of her father's Gamilaroi people of New South Wales, particularly its traditional carved trees and wooden shields.\nShe was thrilled when the publishers asked her to illustrate the book: \"I read Alice in Wonderland as a child and loved the story, and knew it was special and very important.\" She spent an intense six weeks drawing and creating her watercolour, ink and gouache images, reconfiguring such creatures as the Caterpillar as a witchetty grub, the White Rabbit as a white kangaroo, and the Cheshire Cat as a wildcat, in strongly linear images in vibrant colour. To make the wildcat disappear, she created the whole work of art and then gradually sprayed it white.\nThe Alice stories and the traditional Gamilaroi stories share the universal appeal of narrative, but Leslie doesn't see them as having any close affinity. \"Gamilaroi stories reflect connectedness to land and kin in a very different way to the way in which Alice functions as an imaginative children's story which began in an English cultural context in the 19th century.\"\nLeslie's Alitji paintings were exhibited at ACCA in Melbourne and won the Crichton Award for Children's Book Illustration, and Alitji is still in many libraries. \" Alitji was an inspirational project which has had an extraordinary resonance in my life over time. In the 25 years since it was published, so many people have told me how much they have enjoyed my illustrations.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T16:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:23:13.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
