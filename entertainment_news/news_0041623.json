The girls, both born in Uruguay but having been in France since they were just a few months old, made the 48-hour journey in an air-conditioned vehicle and arrived safely early on Friday morning. \nDudley Zoo’s registrar and research co-ordinator, Dr David Beeston, said he was delighted with the new arrivals. \n“Female sea lions in particular do like to hang about in larger groups so Marina and Tania will be wonderful company for Cleo and Deisy,” he said. 1 / 4", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:10:53.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
