The pool has been closed. Pumpkin ales and Oktoberfests have hit the shelves. Fall is here. While Oktoberfest is generally my favorite fall seasonal, a well-done porter is a close second. An understated style in my opinion, porters fit the season rather perfectly. Dark and roasty, with notes of coffee and smoked malts, the style peaks as the temperate dips. Down in Washington DC, a few guys are making some pretty good beer, among which is a porter dubbed Penn Quarter Porter. The brewery, DC Brau, is the first production brewery in DC since 1956. They like to play the part of being the city's brewery, and they name their beers appropriately: \"The Public\", \"The Citizen\", and of course \"The Corruption\". The porter is named after Penn Quarter, the section of DC that houses the For Theatre. Penn Quarter pours pitch black with a thick and creamy tan head that fades to a thin lace. The aroma has massive notes of roasted malts, chocolate, and coffee. It's rich, but not sweet as some porters can be. None of the 5.50% ABV is noticeable. The taste follows suit. Smoked, roasted malts give tastes of dark chocolate and coffee. A hint of vanilla comes through alongside a slightly earthy, slightly pepper hop taste, though its subtle. The finish is a bit crisp for the style, and would be better if it were brought down just a notch. But overall, the full body and roasted malts give a creamy – though a tad prickly – mouthfeel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T14:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T19:30:33.494+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
