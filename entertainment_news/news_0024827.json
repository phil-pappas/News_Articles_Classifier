Image 53 of 53 Jimi Hendrix's 'Black Widow' guitar stuck in legal battle 1 / 53 Back to Gallery Forty-five years after the death of legendary guitarist Jimi Hendrix, the legal battle over his estate continues.\nThe latest lawsuit was filed Oct. 2 in Pima County, Ariz., Superior Court by Experience Hendrix , a company organized in the state of Washington to run the late singer's merchandise and music licensing business, among other things, according to court records. Hendrix died in September 1970 at age 27.\nThe suit names Rainbow Guitars in Tucson and its owner, Harvey Moltz, as defendants, claiming that the shop has illegal possession of Hendrix's \"Black Widow\" acoustic guitar, according to Courthouse News .\nIn another suit related to the same issue, Experience Hendrix filed suit Nov. 10 in federal court in California against Los Angeles County resident Brian Patterson and Sheldon Reynolds, the ex-husband of Janie Hendrix, who is Jimi Hendrix's sister and the chief executive officer of Experience Hendrix.\nAccording to the federal lawsuit, Experience Hendrix learned in June 2014 that Patterson had contacted Julien's Auctions in Los Angeles, asking the firm's help in selling the Black Widow guitar.\n\"Julien's immediately contacted Plaintiff to ascertain whether or not the Black Widow was legitimate,\" the suit states. \"Prior to that contact, Plaintiff believed that the Black Widow remained in its possession.\"\nReynolds allegedly has two different stories about how he got the Black Widow, according to the federal suit: That he got the Black Widow in a divorce settlement with Janie Hendrix or that a friend who helped him retrieve his belongings from Janie Hendrix's home was told by her 14-year-old son to \"take a pile of guitars and other belongings that included the Black Widow.\"\nNeither story is true, the plaintiff claims in court, because the Black Widow is owned by Experience Hendrix and has never been the property of Janie Hendrix.\nMoltz at Rainbow Guitars did not immediately respond Thursday to a request for comment.", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/02/51/76/696201/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/16/36/57/3795943/3/920x920.jpg",
