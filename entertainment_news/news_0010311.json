But when asked about the film, Varun denied ever being approached for the project.\nAccording to a source, Mohit did first approach Varun, but the latter turned it down due to some reason. But why did he deny being approached? “Varun was just being nice. He didn’t want others to know that he was approached first, just in case it makes other heroes uncomfortable about being the second choice.”\nAdded the source, “Mohit did meet Varun a few months ago to discuss this project. The idea really excited Varun, but after a point he politely turned the offer down. He was doing other movies and felt it wasn’t the right time to do this kind of script.”\nMeanwhile Mohit recently shifted into a new apartment with his wife. Apart from Ekta Kapoor’s project, he has also committed to do a film with Karan Johar, which is a remake of the French film The Intouchables.\n Bollywood Varun Dhawan Ekta Kapoor Chetan Bhagat Karan Johar Also Read Kareena Kapoor stuns in white number Salman Khan reaches home, greets his fans and supporters Everyone is bit of a villain in 'Ek Villain', says Mohit Suri CBCF’s 10 pm act to clear Welcome Back", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151004/entertainment-bollywood/article/varun-turns-down-mohit’s-film-keeps-mum-about-offer", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/269824%20COPY.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/269824%20COPY.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-05T18:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:59:23.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
