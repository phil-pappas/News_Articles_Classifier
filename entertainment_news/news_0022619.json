Posted just a moment ago \nPeter Kramer/NBC (LOS ANGELES) -- Chris Rock is reportedly in talks to host the 88th Academy Awards. \nAfter about a week of negotiations some issues still need to be resolved, according to Deadline.com , but a deal is expected to be reached within the next couple of days. \nThis would be Rock's second time hosting the show. His first stint in 2005 was the second-most-viewed Academy Awards ceremony of the past 10 years, behind the Ellen DeGeneres-hosted show two years ago. \nThe 88th Oscars will be broadcast live from the Dolby Theater in Los Angeles February 28 on ABC. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
