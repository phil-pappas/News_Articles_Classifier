Riley loves to observe the people around him. This habit allows him to create a remarkable character that will play the role of a hero in his latest and fifth novel, “ Burning Ambition ” (published by Xlibris). This book chronicles the life of Jim Devlin. From humble beginnings in South Philadelphia politics to his election as governor of Penna, Jim’s life is a story of true love and driving political ambition . Raised by his mother and his aunt, John has an honest and principled background. His weaknesses and strengths are explored and weighed. He strives to reach his ultimate goal with determination and perseverance. But the love of his life, Kathleen O’Sullivan, gives him an ultimatum – it is either their marriage or politics. He has to pay a price. But is it worth it?\nAn excerpt from the book:\nJohn and Kathleen were spending a good bit of time together because they both loved fine music, opera, and classical music. As Kathleen studied music with the nuns, she was a fine musician, playing the organ for all services at the Sacred Heart Church and other churches for weddings and funerals. John and Kathleen were made for each other. They were kind, thoughtful, courteous and polite. Their personas complimented each other.\nA compelling read, “Burning Ambition” takes readers on an unforgettable journey, a beautiful odyssey through failures and triumphs. It reveals the power of love that can stand the tests of time.\n“Burning Ambition”\nBy John J.
