It has skimpy outfits and killer songs such as \"All That Jazz\" and \"Cell Block Tango.\" \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T17:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:52:25.334+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
