RHS has changed the date of its show to avoid competing with a large postcard show in New Hampshire. The best dealers like to come here because it is the only postcard show in the postcard-rich Midcoast. \nDealers’ tables will be set up in the gymnasium, and the Rockland High School Alumni Museum will be open in a nearby classroom. The Penobscot Marine Museum will sell their historic photograph prints and reproduction postcards; and RHS President Brian Harden will sell postcards from his extensive collection. \nRockland Historical Society will have a table of Old and Curious Things for sale. Those who have anything old to donate for sale are asked to bring it to the society any Tuesday or Thursday afternoon; or call Ann Morris at 594-4601 for pick up. \nThe society also will be selling sandwiches, coffee, and baked goods. The postcard show is its big annual fundraiser; anyone who would like to help is encouraged to call Morris. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
