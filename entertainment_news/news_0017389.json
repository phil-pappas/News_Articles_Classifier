The Moon is in Virgo. Aries (March 21-April 19) \nToday the Mercury retrograde is officially over, which means your interaction with ex-partners and people from your past will diminish. You no longer have to duck down to hide in supermarket aisles. (I did this once in a video store.) Love is so painful. Taurus (April 20-May 20) \nGood news! Today Mercury retrograde is officially over, with the exception of major purchases like cars, computers and cell phones, which should be delayed until Oct. 24. But all those silly mistakes at work? Gone! Now it’s back to business as usual. Today is just a temporary aberration. Gemini (May 21-June 20) \nBecause Mercury is your ruler, you will be glad to know that today Mercury retrograde is over (except for purchases like cars, computers and cell phones, which should wait until Oct. 24). Nevertheless, you might miss running into old flames. Where’s my adoring peanut gallery? Cancer (June 21-July 22) \nFamily discussions can go forward with more confidence now, especially with regard to making plans for the future, or addressing repairs, renovations and improvements to your home. Family businesses will also run with more efficiency starting today. Yay! Leo (July 23-Aug. 22) \nThis is not an ideal day for important financial transactions. People will not cooperate easily or be as generous and open handed as you would wish. However, all the silly errors, glitches and frustrations in your life that you have suffered for the last month will now diminish. Whew! Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22) \nSocial situations might be a bit strained today because Venus is in your sign at odds with stern Saturn. This makes relations with others a bit strained. Emotional warmth is not forthcoming. Obviously, it’s a poor day for social interaction. Fortunately, this is pleasing and brief. Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22) \nYou might prefer to be alone today so that you can work and accomplish something. Yes, it’s Saturday but you’re not really in a party mood. Not really. In fact, you have that sense of things going forward now with positive energy, which makes you want to get busy. Scorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21) \nYou might have difficulties dealing with a friend or people in a group today (a class, meeting, social setting or a large conference). Possibly, someone older or in a position of authority will put a damper on things or create obstacles for you. This is not really a big deal. It just is what it is. Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21) \nThis is not a great day to ask people in authority for permission or approval because they will probably refuse. In fact, authority figures in general will tend to withhold favors from you today. But this is just a brief influence for today only. No worries. Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19) \nDiscussions about politics, religion and racial issues will be discouraging today. Likewise, travel plans that looked hopeful suddenly seemed to be difficult. Don’t give this much weight because this is a temporary setback — virtually only today. Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18) \nAlthough the next month will favor you in terms of dealing with shared property, inheritances and getting loans or mortgages, today is not the day. Something or someone will put the brakes on anything you propose. But this obstacle is for today only. Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20) \nRelations with partners and close friends are a bit stiff today. However, the good news is that you can go forward now with background details related to shared property, inheritances, insurance issues, taxes and debt. Anything that delayed and discouraged you is now gone. Whew! If Your Birthday Is Today \nNovelist/screenwriter James Clavell (1924-1994) shares your birthday today. You have excellent money savvy. You are shrewd, capable and know how to run your affairs. You are also an excellent problem solver, which is why you ensure that you have a beautiful home that runs efficiently. This year is the beginning of a fresh, new nine-year cycle for you. Open any door!
