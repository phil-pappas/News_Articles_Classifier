Ray Harryhausen's Dynamation process, with its emphasis on painstaking, stop-motion animation may look a little quaint nowadays to the CGI generation but Harryhausen was able to imbue his characters with personality and impact.\nThe earliest film here is The 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1958) with Kerwin Mathews as the titular hero trying to help a shrunken princess and encountering such creatures as a cyclops and a roc.\nJason and the Argonauts (1963) is a spectacular retelling of the Greek myth of the quest for the Golden Fleece, with perhaps its highlight being a still-impressive sword battle with a group of skeletons.  \nAdvertisement The Golden Voyage of Sinbad (1973) has our hero (John Phillip Law) on a treasure quest and features a brilliant swordfight with a multi-armed statue of the goddess Kali. The final film in the collection, Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger (1977) stars Patrick Wayne and is easily the weakest of the four, though it too has its moments. \nThere are lots of bonus features, largely focused on the first two (and probably best) films including commentaries, featurettes and documentaries - including some material on films not in the collection. Here's hoping for more Harryhausen releases.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:34:11.399+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
