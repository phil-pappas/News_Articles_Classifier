A jilted bride put her wedding feast to good use feeding Sacramento’s homeless, according to a local report.\nThe salmon and tri-tip would have fed 120 friends and family of Kari Duane’s daughter, Quinn, but it instead went to strangers.\nThe new guests included couples and families with children, all of whom took advantage of the groom’s cold feet that left Duane’s daughter without her dream $35,000 wedding on Saturday, KCRA-TV reported .\nKTLA The bride's mother, Kari Duane, decided to give back after her daughter's fiance got cold feet. KTLA The jilted bride did not attend her wedding feast donated to Sacramento's homeless over the weekend at the Citizen Hotel.

Before tackling mounting bills tied to the wedding, Duane and her daughter will take off to Belize with those honeymoon tickets and reservations.\nnhensley@nydailynews.com", "external_links": ["http://player.ooyala.com/iframe.js#ec=41Mnc5eDoF3GpV9_FWtRnDu6XCBaGpED&pbid=f987944e2b8d47c5ad7da7977780b8bd", "http://www.kcra.com/news/cancelled-wedding-ends-with-meal-offered-to-homeless/35906354"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:36:09.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
