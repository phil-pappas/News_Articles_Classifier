MORE 'EASTENDERS': \nThe actress’s character Kathy Beale is at the centre of much of the action, along with Phil and Ben Mitchell, as the trio are still being haunted by the evil Gavin. \nWe've had a sneak peek at the episode (and it's pretty creepy) \nAhead of the hour-long episode, Gillian revealed what fans can expect from the episode, telling The Huffington Post UK and other reporters: “It was wonderfully written, it was fantastic. Paul Nicholas [who plays Gavin] has turned into this tyrant! \n“He was fantastic. He’s got such a charming smile but he can be really menacing. He loves it – he’s never played anything like that. He’s really gone for it and it’s a joy to behold.” \nPhil is currently being held captive by Gavin, and in tonight’s (Monday 26 October) episode he will return to the Square in a bad way. \nBen and Kathy spy a figure in the shadows \nThe events are set to kick off a huge storyline for Steve McFadden’s character, who will turn to drink again. \n“The reason he’s gone back to drinking is because of what Gavin did to him,” Gillian added. “He’s cunning and clever and knew Phil’s weaknesses. Steve is fantastic in what he does in the episodes onwards.” \nGillian also teased what’s to come for Kathy, confirming that Gavin definitely won’t be easy to shake off. \n“He stays around for a little while, then he disappears,” she said. “I don’t know how long for though, I have no idea. There’s a bit more juicy stuff…” \nOver the weekend, the soap's bosses revealed a trailer for the spooky episode. Check it out below... Close 'EastEnders' Storylines You've Probably Forgotten of   With the help of Sean, Tanya came up with a plan to get rid of her cheating husband for good. Well... Until she had a change of heart and dug him back up. Well, there's not much to say about this is there? that gravelly voice never gets boring, does it? Is there anyway Beppe can come back? Letitia Dean and Paul Medford's characters entered a battle of the bands competition back in 1986, and the song was released by the BBC in real life, landing them at number 12 in the charts. Phil's serious drug use storyline was somewhat undermined by the fact his addiction lasted for approximately 10 days... We all remember 'Who shot Phil?', but what about when Jane was fired at by her step-son? This emotional storyline tackled a number of key issues, bringing mental health issues into the spotlight. Remember him?! Remember Ashley Cotton? The youngster brought some light into grandma Dot's life - until Nick intervened and ruined things... After agreeing to give her baby to Jane, Lucy decided to have a secret termination, agreeing with Ian that they would tell Jane it was a miscarriage. Why are Jane and Ian getting married again? Bianca and Carol may have patched up their differences in recent years, but things were very different in 1999, when they both stared relationships with the same man. Those were the days... (SPOILER: It obviously did not work out well for them...) As weird romances go, this was certainly one of the best... There's a reason the role of Ben Mitchell has been recast so many times, and this serious storyline was transformed into a rather ridiculous one, thanks to the not-so-great acting from this young star.  Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T14:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T15:16:25.203+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
