Morrison's nonprofit of choice, the Clean River Project, will receive $10,000 on his behalf. The three finalists were chosen by a judging panel and then competed in an online public vote to be named Boston's Cox Conserves Hero.\nMorrison was born and raised on the Merrimack River and couldn't bear to see the Methuen shoreline he played on as a kid littered with debris. Ten years ago he founded the Clean River Project, a volunteer initiative that has since removed thousands of tires, 56 cars and tons of recyclable materials from the Merrimack . The debris is collected in booms along the river, then removed and sorted for recycling. Today, residents are enjoying a cleaner river where nesting eagles, heron and fish are thriving.\nThe two runners-up each receive $5,000 for their nonprofits of choice. Martha McDonough selected Neponset River Watershed Association, and Daniel Schenk chose Mass Audubon's Boston Nature Center.\nBoston's Cox Conserves Heroes program is sponsored locally by Warrendale Appliance.\nThe national Cox Conserves Heroes program was created in 2008 through a partnership between The Trust for Public Land and Cox Enterprises, the parent company of FOX25. The partnership stems from Cox Enterprises' national Cox Conserves sustainability program that focuses on reducing waste and energy consumption, conserving water and inspiring eco-friendly behavior.\nCox Conserves Heroes also takes place in Arizona , California , Florida , Georgia , Louisiana and Virginia . Through the national Cox Conserves Heroes program, nearly $600,000 has been donated to environmental nonprofits and more than 150 volunteers have been honored.\nFor more information, visit CoxConservesHeroes.com or Facebook .\nSocial Media: #CoxConservesHeroes and #CoxConservesHero\nAbout FOX25:\nFOX25 News is a part of Cox Media Group and is the leading provider of local news, weather, and traffic.
