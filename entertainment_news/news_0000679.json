Lawyer Gloria Allred introduced the trio at a news conference Los Angeles on Wednesday, The New York Times reports. Though it is too late for the women to take legal action against the comedian due to the statute of limitations expiring, Allred said \"these three courageous women want Mr. Cosby to be accountable for what they believe was his misconduct towards them.\" The three new accusers include Lisa Christie, a former model who said she appeared in Jell-O commercials with Cosby and was an extra on The Cosby Show . She said she met Cosby at a hotel in Chicago where he had dinner and a drink ready for her. Bill Cosby stripped of honorary degrees Pamela Abeyta said that she met him in Las Vegas in 1979 and that she believed someone put something in her drink, and Sharon Van Ert said that she was a waitress at a jazz club in California where they met in 1976. A spokesman for Cosby's legal team was \"not making any comment\" about the women's accusations. Cosby is scheduled to be questioned under oath on Friday, Oct. 9 in a case involving a different woman.
