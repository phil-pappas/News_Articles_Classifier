The Verdi Requiem had not been attempted by this ensemble for almost two decades, not since 1996 performances conducted by then-conductor Albert-George Schram. \nFriday’s concert found conductor David Cho recognizing, and luring, from his ensemble every ounce of possible dramatic weight. \nPremiered in 1874 as a tribute to novelist Alessandro Manzoni, Verdi’s Requiem also calls for a double choir and soloists. Taking part Friday, specifically, were more than 220 performers on the same stage: 70 orchestra members, conducted by Cho; 107 Lubbock Chorale singers, directed by John Hollins; and 44 more vocalists representing the Texas Tech Choir, directed by Rick Bjella. \nCho also situated four trumpets off stage. \nLiterally everything worked, especially on an emotional level, in a 90-minute Requiem performed without intermission. \nVerdi’s Requiem has seven parts — Requiem, Dies irae, Offertorio, Sanctus, Agnus Dei, Lux aeterna and Libera me — with the composer initially following the Latin text of a Roman Catholic funeral mass. Not all of the Latin was translated Friday on screens in the stage’s wings — but certainly enough to make it clear that Verdi preferred angry warnings to comfort. \nThere is a darkness within poor wretches begging for rest, with days becoming “exceedingly bitter” until, at last, the world is “judged by fire.” \nMusicians were spot on throughout, with brass and percussion adding to intensity and concertmaster Zachary Saathoff skillfully opening doors to a calming effect when necessary. Some are bound to recall Cho conducting in far more animated fashion as incredible choral vocals merged into a dramatic whole, released as though erupting from a musical volcano. \nThe combined performances commanded attention, entertaining whether leaning toward a peaceful end-of-days or vision-of-hell experience. There are pleas for deliverance from eternal death, with mystery enveloping a day of wrath. \nFour guest soloists, no strangers to this work, held nothing back Friday, meeting every vocal challenge. One doubts that these seasoned voices have often sounded better. \nFeatured singers — Cody Austin, tenor; David Grogan, bass; Jill Grove, mezzo-soprano; and Rebecca Wascoe-Hays, soprano — excelled as soloists, and enchanted when singing together. \nFrom the beginning, Grove impressed not only with her singular, enriching voice, but because she did not appear satisfied to just sing. Standing behind a music stand, she also acted a part, using slight nuances in expression, or a widening of fingers, to add to fear or desperation within her text. \nWascoe-Hays, a handkerchief clutched in her left hand, never was at a loss for power, holding notes and finding a renewed emphasis via subtle movement. \nGrogan did not tire, even when singing longer passages, his voice retaining a forceful authority. And Austin, seemingly the youngest, revealed a consistent vocal warmth and strength whether singing of eternal rest or the potential horror of being judged. \nTo his credit, Cho did not allow choirs or soloists to be overshadowed by his ensemble, even as musicians provided an anchor, dictating mood. \nThe requiem does come across as operatic. Yet it seems safe to conclude that those who avoid opera, as a rule, also will be caught up in the performance. \nCho obviously respects this Requiem, appearing to silently whisper vocalists’ parts while offering cues, even as the 221 performers on stage become a force to be reckoned with. \nwilliam.kerns@lubbockonline.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T11:44:18.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
