Some items are for sale, but much of the event is focused on being hands-on and interactive. Courtesy For the third year of the NoCo Mini Maker Faire, the Colorado Maker Hub staff is hoping to make the event bigger and better.It will be held in Loveland on Oct. 10 and 11. There will be an adults-only event on Oct. 9 from 6 to 9 p.m. During the nighttime event, there will be at least 20 craft distilleries from the area, along with a tasting.Elise VanDyne, a spokeswoman with the nonprofit organization, said in the first year, attendance peaked at 2,300 people. Last year it nearly doubled with 4,300 people attending.\"We expect more this year,\" she said. \"It is kind of the model for maker faires to grow every year.\"VanDyne said this is the largest such event in Colorado and that people from at least 23 states have traveled to attend.She noted the faire's location helps attendance. Since the Rocky Mountain Center for Innovation and Technology is a large manufacturing building, VanDyne said makers who use fire or lasers are better suited to come to this type of location.\"We have expansive space, and we make use of it,\" she said.She said one of the best aspects of the event is that it spurs creativity.\"At a maker faire, you get exposed to things you'd never see,\" she said. \"Where else would you see welders? Or a community sculpture?\"Much of the event is hands-on and interactive, but some of the makers do have items for sale.
