Amber Rose struggles to hold back tears as she speaks of her exes Kanye West and Wiz Khalifa. Picture: YouTube/Hollywood Fix \nWARNING: Graphic language \nAMBER Rose was a bundle of emotions when she was joined by hundreds of scantily-clad backers as she led a protest against sexual violence and ‘slut-shaming’. \nThe curvaceous 31-year-old actor and model was all smiles as she led the SlutWalk march in Los Angeles with the support of her mother, waving a sign that read ‘Strippers Have Feelings Too’. \nBut when she opened up onstage about being slut-shamed as a mere 14-year-old and raised her nasty high-profile breakups in front of the crowd of people at the weekend event, she broke down in tears. Proud protester \nIn a clip posted on YouTube , Rose spoke of her emotional pain in the wake of slanderous comments made be her rapper ex-lovers, Kanye West and Wiz Khalifa . \nMost famously, Kanye said in a radio interview he had to take 30 showers after breaking up with Rose before Kim Kardashian would have considered hooking up with him.
