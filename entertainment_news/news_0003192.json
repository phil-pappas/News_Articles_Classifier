Our sources say doctors have been clear ... the fact that Lamar is not getting better significantly reduces his chances of survival. \nAs we reported, on Wednesday doctors gave Lamar a 50/50 chance of pulling through. \nAs one source put it, \"The doctors are concerned it has been too long that he's been in this condition and now it's not looking good.\" \nLamar used cocaine on his first day at a brothel Saturday, employees told 911 dispatchers, according to authorities. On a 911 call played at a news conference, a woman said she also saw him take 10 herbal sex tablets over three days. \nThe brothel's employees also told 911 operators that when they found him Tuesday, Odom was lying in bed on his side with a pinkish fluid coming from his mouth and nose. \nAs details eked out about what may have led to Odom's hospitalization, members of the Kardashian family have revealed few specifics to their millions of social media followers, instead posting photos of happier times as they rallied support and pushed for prayer. \nKourtney Kardashian shared a photo of Odom hugging one of her children. \n\"Believing in the power of prayer for this beautiful soul,\" she wrote. \nOdom's father and two children have been with him at the hospital, along with the Kardashians. \nIn a statement released through their publicist Thursday afternoon, Destiny Odom and Lamar Odom Jr. asked for prayers. \n\"Thanks for your outpouring of prayers and support for our dad. We are here with our family and friends,\" the statement said. \"We appreciate everyone respecting our privacy at this time. We ask for your continued prayers.\" SHARE THIS STORY", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T13:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:28:47.466+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
