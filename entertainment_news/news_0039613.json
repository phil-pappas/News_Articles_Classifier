The trip had been miserable: I was, sadly, a bed wetter, and I had Pampers hidden in my sleeping bag—a gigantic and shameful secret to carry. My mom was there to pick me up, and she was taking pictures like a paparazzo. Seeing her made the stress of the last few days hit home, and something shifted inside me.\" \n\"It happened as fast as the sun going behind a cloud,\" she recalls. \"You know how you can be fine one moment, and the next it's, 'Oh my God, I f***ing have the flu!'? It was like that. Only this flu lasted for three years.\" \nAfter several years of therapy, which included a stint on Xanax, the 44-year-old actress/comedienne finally thought she had it beat, only to have it return at 22. \"Since then I've lived with depression and learned to control it, or at least to ride the waves as best I can,\" she tells the magazine. \"I'm on a small dose of Zoloft, which, combined with therapy, keeps me healthy but still lets me feel highs and lows.\" \nThat change in outlook has also prompted another change in her life: \"A few years ago, I casually said something in an interview about being afraid to have kids because I might pass depression on to them, but I don't know if I feel that way anymore,\" she notes. \n\"A part of me is baby crazy,\" she confesses. \"A part of me goes, Why not? And every day I add 'Freeze eggs?' to the end of my to-do list. Then it keeps getting passed on to the next day's list. Maybe I'll adopt.\" \nHowever, Sarah also admits, \"I do have sorrow about the possibility that I may never have my own children.\" \nSarah plays a self-destructive mother in the upcoming movie I Smile Back , opening October 23. \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
