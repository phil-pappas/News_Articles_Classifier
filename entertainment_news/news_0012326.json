Since Dorsey and his partners started the service, Twitter has lost nearly $2 billion; investors are now worried that the company's third-quarter results, scheduled for October 27, will be another disappointment.\nStill, early trading in shares of Twitter Inc. suggested that investors agree with Dorsey, that the company must cut back before it begins to grow.\nShares rose almost 3 percent after the opening bell Tuesday.\nDorsey has acknowledged that Twitter is too confusing for many people to use, turning off new users at a time when other social services such as Snapchat and Facebook's WhatsApp have grown in popularity.\nAs part of its revival plan, Twitter last week unveiled a new feature called \"Moments\" that packages commentary, video and photos about major events that have captured people's attention. The work on Moments began while Dorsey's predecessor, Dick Costolo, was still Twitter's CEO.\nAfter returning as CEO, Dorsey promised to make Twitter more accessible to the masses next year. Jettisoning jobs will give Twitter more financial leeway while it designs new tools.\nTwitter's expenses through the first half of the year climbed 44 percent to $1.2 billion. The company's revenue totaled $938 million during the same period.\nThe company said Tuesday that it would pay between $10 million and $20 million, almost all in severance costs. Total restructuring costs are estimated to be between $5 million and $15 million, charges which would be recognized by the end of this year.\n Associated Press\n Twitter, Inc.
