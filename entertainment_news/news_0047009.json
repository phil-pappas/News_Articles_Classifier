Taking Iranian philosopher Reza​ Negarestani's​ precis on the inherently enigmatic and fearful nature of contemporaneity​ as its nub, this spatially and visually coherent group show (which features Clare Milledge​, Zac Langdon-Pole, Alex Cuffe, Uri Aran and others) covers some dark and layered material. Andre Piguet's​ work takes the form of a elongated, shadowy painting in dark greens, blues and blacks, a thick crust of epoxy resin – riddled with facets and cracks – diluting and complicating our gaze. Nearby, a trio of wall-mounted sculptures by Joshua Petherick almost echoes the effect. These modified cereal boxes (apparently still with cereal inside) sport exterior surfaces that are riddled with ruptured epoxy textures, various treatments, layers and buried neo-gothic images. New Zealand artist Richard Frater offers a couple of simple, yet loaded gestures across the exhibitions' two spaces. In the front gallery, he leaves a scattering of new and rusted nails – their heads and tips disembodied from their shafts – while in the rear gallery, a wall sculpture sees a sewing needle thread together the two portions of a bisected​ drill bit. Also in the back space, Isadora Vaughan's dissected plaster and hessian sculpture reads like a fossilised tree trunk or beastly vertebrae, while Tim Bruckovic's​ paintings drift between gestural abstraction and muddy landscape. The world is an unknowable place indeed.\nUntil October 17; STATION, 9 Ellis Street, South Yarra, 9826 2470, stationgallery.com.au \nAnna Finlayson's 370 Squares . \nANNA FINLAYSON: SUBJECTIVE GRID \nAdvertisement The first cycle of exhibitions in Sarah Scout Presents' new chambers at 12 Collins Street holds true to the gallery's whim for domestically scaled works and unconventional approaches to space and installation. Running alongside a compact exhibition of happily sardonic sculptural works by Lewis Fidock​, Anna Finlayson's fastidiously ordered and minimalist paintings make for an unlikely joy. Her ongoing spectrum works will appeal to those with an obsessive/compulsive streak; here Finlayson meticulously rules and annotates her own detailed grids on paper, only to fill them in with an ever-shifting spectrum of orderly gouache daubs, recording the time and date of each in the process. They serve as both an aesthetic exploration and an almost diaristic​ record of artistic activity. Her palette works are similarly intriguing, with the artist creating strangely exact smudges and circular line work on various crystal and china plates and dishes. Finlayson's colour choices and gestures may be pretty and palatable but the sustained rigour of her process and logic puts these works in another realm entirely.\nUntil November 7; Sarah Scout Presents, level 1, 12 Collins Street, city, 9654 4429, sarahscoutpresents.com \nJoshua Petherick, Petrified Dawn VII , 2015, Corn Flakes in modified packaging of polyurethane resin, weld-bond, carbon powder, silicone rubber, Lovingearth Organic Purple Corn Extract, spirulina. \nISADORA VAUGHAN: SLATY CLEAVAGE \nIt's easy to miss Isadora Vaughan's striking new sculptural installation at public window space Chapter House Lane, despite its sheer scale, level of detail and evocative heft. Replacing an entire, vast window panel with a towering sculptural relief, Vaughan's Slaty Cleavage might be mistaken for a temporary hoarding but this singular work is anything but. Made with what seems to be a single sheet of beaten copper, painted and smeared with enamel in white-red tones and textural treatments, Vaughan's work holds both an industrial and visceral, physiological charge. It reads almost like a bandage, a dressing — its decaying industrial materiality offset by its rounded, curved, undulating depressions, which are unmistakable in their subjective, very human, gestures. As such, it forges a fascinating sense of tension. Vaughan hints at the humanness of all manner of different materials and treatments. Our echo and our trace marks almost everything we touch.
