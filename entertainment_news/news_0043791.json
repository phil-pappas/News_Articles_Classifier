The price tag, between the cost of the car and a warranty, ran just under $24,000.\nIt's an unusual benefit among 16 Lake County and large suburban school districts surveyed, most of which gave a flat allowance to reimburse school leaders for miles driven. But it's not so unusual in Waukegan, where Deputy Superintendent Mary Lamping is one of four administrators driving cars owned or leased by the district, which also covers their maintenance and gas, according to district records.\nSuperintendent Donaldo Batiste, who drives a district-leased 2014 Toyota Corolla, said he's constantly traveling between the district's 21 schools, district and community events and meetings around the state.\n\"We are 24/7, 365-day-a-year employees,\" Batiste said. \"No matter where we are, what we're doing, we're always on.\"\n\"This is a very demanding job, and I don't know if a lot of people realize how demanding it is,\" he said. \"I can only speak for my own perspective as a district employee, but I think it's necessary.\"\nBut School Board President Michael Rodriguez said the benefit, included in some current administrators' contracts, is something he wants the board to reconsider, particularly as Batiste plans to retire at the end of the school year.\n\"This is an opportunity for us to rethink a lot of things, what we're willing to pay, and what the perks and benefits are going to be,\" he said.\nWhile many districts surveyed provide transportation benefits for top administrators, just one other district purchased a car for a superintendent's use.\nMost require administrators own their own cars but provide a flat transportation allowance rather than make administrators submit reimbursement requests for miles driven.\nDollar amounts varied from $150 per month in Woodland School District 50 to $650 per month in Naperville School District 203., which also gave assistant superintendents about $125 per month with smaller sums for school principals, according to district records.\nSchaumburg School District 54's superintendent Andrew DuRoss said he's never formally tracked his mileage but estimates he covers 12,000 miles per year traveling between the district's 28 schools, attending county-wide meetings and making regular trips to Springfield to advocate for the district. DuRoss' contract provides $600 per month.\nOfficials at District 203, Round Lake Area Schools School District 116 and West Aurora School District 129 all said they expect and require administrators are out in the district, not behind a desk.\n\"I think it's important for the superintendent to be out in public with the communities we serve,\" said District 116 board president Kevin Daniels.\nSome district officials said flat payments make sense because superintendents are on the road so much it would be too difficult and time-consuming to keep track of miles traveled.\n\"We try to not make it an accounting nightmare while being fair to people,\" said District 129 superintendent Jeff Craig, whose contract provides $500 per month.\nAnd while larger districts with more schools often gave their administrators larger travel allowances to cover more and longer trips between district buildings, the largest district surveyed — Elgin School District U-46, with 54 schools and 40,332 students, according to the state board of education — had the second-lowest travel allowance for a superintendent, $200 per month, while the superintendent at New Trier Township High School District 203, with 2 schools and just 4,206 students, has a contract providing for $500 per month.\nNew Trier Superintendent Linda Yonke said that when she became superintendent in 2006, the district had been providing a car for her predecessor, but she didn't feel it was necessary and had recently purchased a new one. Yonke said they settled on $500 per month to cover all driving expenses because it was comparable to what other superintendents received.\n\"With all the travel that's required, especially at the high schools with all the extracurricular events, I think it's warranted,\" she said.\nElgin also pays two other administrators $200 per month and lets two administrators responsible for snow plowing and assessing whether snowy roads are safe enough to drive take home cars in the winter, said district spokeswoman Mary Fergus.\nFour districts' top administrators, of those reviewed, had contracts offering no travel benefits beyond the standard mileage reimbursement: New Lenox-based Lincoln-Way High School District 210, East Aurora School District 131, Gurnee School District 56 and Grayslake Community Consolidated School District 46.\nDistrict 46 superintendent Ellen Correll said the contract she was offered when she first came to the district 11 years ago included a car allowance, but she opted to forgo the flat payment and request reimbursement for miles driven on district business.\n\"I decided it's better I get paid for what I drive,\" Correll said.\nYonke and Plainfield School District 202 Superintendent Lane Abrell, who receives a $300 per month car allowance, said district-provided cars and housing allowances used to be more common, which Abrell chalked up to growing attention to taxpayer dollars.\nBut Batiste said it's \"shortsighted\" to focus only on perks, which he said are \"minor compared to what you get from a great superintendent and leadership for a district this needy.\"\n\"There are points that are often missed when you try to reduce matters to dollars and cents,\" he said.\nHe also argued the contract he inherited from a prior superintendent, which guaranteed a flat travel allowance, would cost the district more than what it takes to provide a car. Lease payments on his Corolla are $216 per month, down from the $569 per month the district paid for the Toyota 4Runner he drove prior to 2014.\nSt. Charles Community Unit School District 303 appears to have agreed. Superintendent Don Schlomann's contract provides either a $600 per month travel allowance or a district-owned vehicle, if the board decides that's in the district's best interests. District meeting minutes show they did purchase a vehicle for his use, most recently a $19,300 2011 Ford Fusion Sport after hail damage totaled his previous vehicle in early 2014.\nBut it's difficult to compare districts, since administrators receiving auto allowances use that money to cover gas and maintenance, something not included in the monthly lease payments or purchase fees. In addition to Lamping and Batiste's vehicles, District 60 purchased 2011 GMC Acadias for Associate Superintendent of Campus Relations, Operations, Staff and Student Safety William Newby and Director of Operations LeBaron Moten for $23,900 and $23,200.\nDistrict records show the district spent $4,430 on off-site maintenance on district-owned administrator vehicles since 2010, but district attorney and FOIA officer Thomas Morris said the district handles some maintenance in-house, including most oil changes.\nThe district is also unable to say how much it spent on fuel for administrators' vehicles because they're allowed to fill the tanks at a district-owned pump that doesn't track how much each individual with access uses, Morris said.\nBatiste said he wasn't sure how much fuel adds to his monthly vehicle bill because the pump displays only gallons dispensed, not the price.\nRodriguez said the free gas and lack of distinction between business and personal use are \"established practices\" the district has started looking into. They're working with the search firm they hired to help choose Batiste's successor to settle on appropriate compensation, he said.\n\"We have to be competitive, but we have to be frugal,\" Rodriguez said.\nlzumbach@tribpub.com\nTwitter @laurenzumbach\nCopyright © 2015, Lake County News-Sun Travel Waukegan Toyota Motor Corp.", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561831df/turbine/ct-lns-school-administrator-travel-perks-st-1008-20151009"], "published": "2015-10-10T00:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:20:44.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
