After struggling for years to conceive a child with husband John Legend , the model and television host shared her happy baby news with fans.\nIn her message, Teigen, who is known for being highly active on social media, wrote, \"John and I are so happy to announce that we are pregnant :) As many of you know, we've been trying to have a baby for a while now. It hasn't been easy, but we kept trying because we can't wait to bring our first child into the world and grow our family. We're so excited that it's finally happening. Thank you for all your love and well wishes. I look forward to all the belly touching!\"\nChrissy Teigen and John Legend tied the knot in September 2013, after four years of dating and a three-year engagement. Since then, they have struggled in secret to start a family.\nJust last month, during an episode of \"FABLife,\" on which she serves as a host, Teigen opened up about her struggles to have a child. According to a report by Entertainment Tonight on September 16, Teigen explained that two years into her marriage, she and Legend are often faced with questions regarding their future plans for children, but sadly, Teigen claimed she had been unable to get pregnant, stating, \"it's been a process.\"\nTeigen's revelation regarding her fertility struggles followed that of Tyra Banks, who also revealed her private struggles for the first time on \"FABLife.\" For years, the America's Next Top Model host tried to have a child, but despite her wishes, she was unable. Even after taking on IVF treatments, Banks saw no success, and continues to struggle in her efforts to have a child.\nIn addition to her work on \"FABLife,\" the now-pregnant Teigen is also hosting Spike TV's \"Lip Sync Battle\" with rapper and actor LL Cool J. The series began in April of this year, and was recently renewed for a second season.", "external_links": ["http://www.etonline.com/news/172053_chrissy_teigen_discusses_fertility_struggles_with_emotional_tyra_banks/", "https://instagram.com/p/8wbqn2pjVD/"], "published": "2015-10-13T02:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:08:19.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
