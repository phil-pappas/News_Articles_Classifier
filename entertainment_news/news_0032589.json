The transgender actress will slip in the role of Dr. Frank-N-Furter, which was once made famous by Tim Curry . Frank-N-Furter is described as a sexually ambiguous flirtatious alien mad-scientist who creates \"Rocky Horror\", a fit and attractive man created solely to fulfill his desires. Curry played the Transylvanian character in both the Broadway production and the 1975 movie adaptation. FOX's TV adaptation is said to be a reimagining of the 20th Century Fox cult classic, which celebrated its 40th anniversary this year and continues to be screened at midnight in theaters across the country. Announced earlier this year, the reboot will be directed, choreographed and exec produced by \"High School Musical\" helmer Kenny Ortega. The two-hour special is scheduled to premiere in fall 2016 but filming is done in advance. Cox became the first transgender actress to earn an Emmy nomination for her role on Netflix dramedy. She is also attached to CBS' \"Doubt\" pilot as a transgender attorney. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:52:08.494+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
