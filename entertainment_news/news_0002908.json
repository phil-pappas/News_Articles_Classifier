If you started the perfect lineup from Week 7, or were unlucky enough to play all of the week’s biggest busts, this is what it looked like. \nNote: Each lineup will be updated if a Monday Night Football performer puts up more points or busts more egregiously than the players from Thursday and Sunday. The fantasy scoring system used is from Yahoo Sports leagues. \nVersions of this article also appear on Yahoo Sports. Highest-Scoring QB: Kirk Cousins \nFantasy Points (Yahoo Sports Leagues): 30.18 \nWashington fell behind the Buccaneers 24-0 with 8:19 remaining in the second quarter and heard boos from the home crowd. From that point forward, Cousins and Co. outscored the Bucs 31-6 and came away victorious. Cousins completed 33-of-40 passes for 317 yards and three touchdowns to go along with a rushing TD. Regarding boos from the fans, the young QB said postgame , “You certainly don’t want to hear them. They paid for their ticket. They can do what they want. But I heard cheers at the end. That’s all that matters.” All-Bust QB: Eli Manning \nProjected points (position rank) : 17.7 (11th) Actual points (position rank): 6.4 (24th) \nThis is Eli Manning’s second straight week in this space, joining his brother Peyton as the only two-time All-Bust performers so far this season. Since exploding for 441 passing yards against the 49ers in Week 5, Manning has totaled 359 yards with just one touchdown and two interceptions. \nThough Giants fans are likely content with the club atop the NFC East and Manning throwing picks less often than he ever has, Eli’s fantasy owners must be a bit exasperated. His touchdown rate is the second-lowest mark of his career since becoming a full-time starter in 2005. \nThat’s not the only reason why the Giants have just 14 offensive touchdowns through seven games. They’ve been awful in the red zone, scoring on just 39.1 percent of their trips there this season (the league average is 55.8 percent). For a team with two above-average red zone targets in Larry Donnell and Odell Beckham Jr., that’s a strange and concerning trend. Highest-Scoring RB1: Lamar Miller \nFantasy Points (Yahoo Sports Leagues): 35.60 \nMiami’s decision to fire head coach Joe Philbin has had nothing but positive effects thus far for running back Lamar Miller. He rushed for over 100 yards last week against Tennessee, and he kept the train rolling in a 44-26 thrashing of the Houston Texans in Week 7. The 24-year-old ran for 175 yards and a touchdown (on just 14 carries) to accompany three receptions for 61 yards and another score. With Philbin out of the picture, it appears Miller will be a reliable fantasy stud for the remainder of the season. All-Bust RB1: LeGarrette Blount \nProjected points: 10.7 (16th) Actual points: -0.3 (N/A) \nLeGarrette Blount’s fantasy owners probably weren’t expecting a huge day from the 28-year-old against the Jets’ stout run defense, which came in allowing the second-fewest points to running backs. But they wouldn’t have been crazy to expect positive yardage, especially since Blount’s backfield mate, Dion Lewis, was sidelined with an abdominal injury. \nInstead, New England basically decided to play backyard football. Brady threw the ball a whopping 54 times and finished as the Patriots’ leading rusher (four carries, 15 yards) for the first time in his career. Blount, meanwhile, netted -3 yards on three touches, as he and third-down back James White combined for just five rushing attempts. \nAt least Blount won’t be gassed before a quick turnaround for a Thursday Night Football contest at home against Miami. Highest-Scoring RB2: Todd Gurley \nFantasy Points (Yahoo Sports Leagues): 28.30 \nThe 21-year-old rookie out of Georgia just continues to play at a high level. He missed the first two games of the season while recovering from a torn ACL and experienced a rough NFL debut against Pittsburgh (six carries for nine yards). But Gurley has now rushed for more than 120 yards in three straight contests. The difference landing him on the highest-scoring lineup this week was the two touchdowns he scored on the ground — the first two of his young career. All-Bust RB2: Alfred Morris \nProjected points: 10.0 (20th) Actual points: 0.7 (T-65th) \nRobert Griffin III is more well-known in Washington for precipitously declining after a promising rookie season in 2012, but Morris has quietly mirrored that path. Since recording 1,613 rushing yards in his first NFL campaign, his average rush has steadily declined from 4.8 yards in 2012 to 3.3 yards in 2015. We’re almost halfway through the season, and Morris is averaging 43.1 yards per game with no touchdowns to show for his efforts. \nWith Washington going into its bye week, Morris’ owners should keep their ears to the ground for any permanent changes coming to the club’s backfield depth chart. Highest-Scoring WR1: T.Y. Hilton \nFantasy Points (Yahoo Sports Leagues): 27.00 \nIndianapolis fell behind the Saints 27-0, but Hilton came alive in the third quarter as the Colts attempted to claw their way back. He connected with Andrew Luck for an 87-yard touchdown strike and then again for a 46-yard score. He caught just four of his 15 targets, but they went for 150 receiving yards and the aforementioned two TDs. All-Bust WR1: Jordan Matthews \nProjected points: 9.9 (13th) Actual points: 1.4 (T-76th) \nComing into the season, Jordan Matthews had a golden chance to become the No. 1 option in Philadelphia’s passing game in lieu of Jeremy Maclin’s departure. Has that opportunity come and gone? \nAfter leading the Eagles in targets in each of their first five games, Matthews has seen his role slightly diminished. On Sunday night, he finished third on the team with seven targets for the second time in the last three weeks. Even though the customary slot receiver didn’t have to match up against Carolina’s top corner, Josh Norman, Matthews only mustered 14 yards on three catches. Highest-Scoring WR2: Nate Washington \nFantasy Points (Yahoo Sports Leagues): 24.70 \nOwned in just 4 percent of Yahoo leagues entering the week, Washington made the most of garbage time in a blowout loss against the Dolphins. He caught both of his touchdowns (his first two of the season) in the fourth quarter. All told, the 32-year-old veteran caught nine of 16 targets for 127 yards. Fantasy owners shouldn’t clamor to pick him up off the waiver wire, though, as this performance is likely an aberration. All-Bust WR2: Odell Beckham Jr. \nProjected points: 11.7 (4th) Actual points: 3.5 (T-54th) \nSunday marked season lows for Odell Beckham Jr. in targets (six), receptions (four) and yards (35). Though it was certainly a disappointing outing, Beckham’s fantasy owners shouldn’t be worried. \nThe NFC East rivalry game unfolded quite oddly. Dallas maintained possession for 63.6 percent of the game behind a run-heavy game plan designed to limit mistakes from new starting QB Matt Cassel. \nCassel still managed to throw three second-half picks in Giants territory, wasting those lengthy drives that kept Beckham and New York’s offense off the field. It was a joyous occasion for Giants fans, and a frustrating development for Beckham’s owners. Highest-Scoring TE: Jordan Reed \nFantasy Points (Yahoo Sports Leagues): 19.20 \nIn terms of playmakers on the outside, Reed was the catalyst for Washington’s comeback victory. The tight end, who had missed the previous two weeks due to a concussion, caught 11 passes for 72 yards and two touchdowns. All-Bust TE: Julius Thomas \nProjected points: 7.3 (6th) Actual points: 0.4 (T-40th) \nJulius Thomas looked primed to rediscover his Denver form following a 7-78-1 performance against Houston last week. Those who were anticipating a rousing follow-up against Buffalo this week were sorely disappointed. \nThomas hauled in just one of his five targets for four yards. Thomas sat out a few plays after failing to bring in a deep ball, prompting Rotoworld to speculate that he could still be building up his conditioning following the long layoff from his hand injury. \nIt’s good, then, that Thomas has a bye week before Jacksonville’s next contest against the Jets in Week 9. Highest-Scoring Flex: Arian Foster \nFantasy Points (Yahoo Sports Leagues): 24.50 \nProvided that the Dolphins scored 44 points and Houston scored just 26 on Sunday, it’s odd that the Texans have more representatives on Week 7’s perfect fantasy lineup. Foster wasn’t overly impressive on the ground — 18 carries for 59 yards (3.3 yards per carry) and a touchdown — but he performed well in the passing game by catching five passes for 66 yards and another score. Unfortunately for his fantasy owners who waited out the first few weeks before getting him back, Foster reportedly suffered a torn Achilles that will end his season. All-Bust Flex: DeAndre Hopkins \nProjected points: 12.8 (1st) Actual points: 5.0 (T-41st) \nFollowing a fantastic showing against the Jaguars last week, DeAndre Hopkins and the entire Texans team looked like they spent a little too much time on the beach leading up to their second game in Florida in as many weeks. \nMiami embarrassed Houston, leading 41-0 after two quarters to render the entire second half garbage time. Nate Washington (9-127-2) was the main beneficiary in his first game since suffering a hamstring injury, while Hopkins logged a ho-hum six catches and 50 yards. \nThat’s not a bad output by normal standards, but Hopkins’ owners were likely banking on a better showing from the NFL’s leader in receiving yards. The rising star still sits at the top of the leaderboard in that category, and targets, by a comfortable margin. Highest-Scoring D/ST: St. Louis Rams \nFantasy Points (Yahoo Sports Leagues): 25.00 \nThe Cleveland Browns couldn’t get anything going against the Rams defense on Sunday. They managed to score just six points, and while neither Josh McCown nor Johnny Manziel threw an interception, St. Louis racked up four sacks and forced four fumbles. One of those four fumbles opened the scoring thanks to a 20-yard return from Rodney McLeod. All-Bust D/ST: Houston Texans \nProjected points: 8.3 (6th) Actual points: 2.0 (T-22nd) \nSan Diego’s defense was the clear loser of Week 7, recording -3 points in a season-defining defeat to Oakland. But most people already knew not to trust the Chargers D/ST, which is only owned in 3 percent of Yahoo leagues. \nSo, for the third time in the last four weeks, I have no choice but to highlight the Texans’ defense, which is quickly becoming the most disappointing unit in the NFL in both traditional and fantasy terms. \nBy now, you’ve probably heard about the myriad ways in which the Dolphins destroyed Houston’s once vaunted defense. If you haven’t seen it for yourself already, here are the highlights . It’s truly stunning to see how slow the Texans look, and how seemingly incapable they are of making a fundamentally sound tackle. Highest-Scoring K: Blair Walsh \nFantasy Points (Yahoo Sports Leagues): 20.00 \nMinnesota dispatched the hapless Lions 28-19 primarily because the Vikes’ kicker was so solid. Walsh connected on all five of his field goal tries — including two from more than 50 yards out. Funnily enough, he missed one of his two extra points. Apparently he just needs a higher degree of difficulty to perform. All-Bust K: Adam Vinatieri \nProjected points: 7.8 (T-19th) Actual points: 3.0 (T-22nd) \nVinatieri wasn’t at fault for his placement here this week (3-for-3 on extra points), but it was representative of his 2015 season. \nWith Indianapolis struggling more than anyone imagined they would, the Colts have rarely been in a position to kick field goals. And when they have, Vinatieri hasn’t been automatic (5-for-7). The 42-year-old also missed an extra point earlier this year for the first time since 2009. \nVinatieri has been the No. 27 kicker by Yahoo standard scoring this year. He’s still owned in 81 percent of leagues, but I would implore you to drop him if you’re contributing to that figure. With Colts coach Chuck Pagano on the hot seat, he would seemingly get more aggressive in fourth-down scenarios, if anything. \nThat means even fewer opportunities for Vinatieri, and more heartbreak for his fantasy owners. Final Tally: Highest-Scoring Lineup \nHere’s the final recap of the perfect fantasy lineup from Week 6 of the 2015 NFL season: \nKirk Cousins: 30.18", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T18:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:54:53.891+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
