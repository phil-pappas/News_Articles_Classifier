Picture , Courtesy of Warner Bros. Picture \nRating: 3/5 stars \nStarring: Levi Miller, Hugh Jackman, Garrett Hedlund, Rooney Mara \nDirector: Joe Wright \nDuration: 111 minutes \nYou mess with a classic at your peril, but J.M. Barrie’s Peter Pan is a safer bet than most. After all, how many of today’s children have sat down to read his 1911 novel? Probably not many more than have seen the original stage production, which closed in 1913. \nScreenwriter Jason Fuchs has taken most of the book’s familiar elements (with the glaring omission of Wendy), given them a good shake and let the pieces fall where they will. \nThus the setting has been moved from Edwardian times to, er, late neo-Georgian? Basically, the Battle of Britain is raging in the skies above the orphanage where Peter is being raised by some really nasty nuns. And Captain Hook is not only sympathetic but in possession of both hands. \nPeter is played by Levi Miller, capturing the sense of wonder and incipient impishness required of a boy who will, we presume, grow up to refuse to grow up. Stolen away in the dead of night by a flying pirate ship, he lands in Neverland, which is being mined for “pixum” (the mineral form of fairy dust) by a snarling Blackbeard. The pirate is played by Hugh Jackman, channelling a bit of Johnny Depp and having a ball. Adding to the chronological confusion, his workers greet newcomers with a chorus by Nirvana. \nPeter quickly makes an ally in a scruffy-looking scoundrel played by Garrett Hedlund. At first I thought he was doing the worst American accent in a film this year, until I discovered that he grew up in Minnesota. Now I don’t know what to make of him. Neither does Peter, though if he’d seen Star Wars he would be able to see right through this guy’s Han Solo swagger. \nThe two of them head off to the far side of Blackbeard’s island, which is where a bunch of indigenous people live in a treetop abode that looks like an Ewok village during Mardi Gras. This is also where the film starts to bog down in plot twists and contrivances, as Peter learns about the circumstances that led to him being placed in an orphanage. \nHis chief source of information is Tiger Lily (Rooney Mara), who also doubles as a love interest for Hedlund’s character. \nThe lily-white actress has caused controversy for being cast in a role that was written as First Nations, but look at the “Injuns” in Disney’s 1953 Peter Pan and you’ll see that director Joe Wright was probably going to get into trouble no matter what. \nWright, whose previous work includes the more sombre if just as literary, adaptations of Pride & Prejudice, Atonement and Anna Karenina, handles the adventurous nature of the story nicely, though he does go on a bit. There’s a breathtaking scene in the early going that amounts to Pirates v. RAF (which would make a smashing title). And I thrilled to the sight of a pirate frigate flying inverted and literally keelhauling another ship. \nBut as the action nears the two-hour mark, its computer-generated-ness starts to wear a little thin, until it’s not even clear where the climactic battle is happening. An ice cave? Pandora? Backstage at a Nirvana concert? \nBut there’s always another Pan, including Steven Spielberg’s critically panned 1991 re-imagining (Hook), and Marc Forster’s 2004 Barrie backstory, Finding Neverland. This Pan isn’t likely to age well, but what do you expect from a story that refuses to grow up? © Copyright (c) The Vancouver Sun", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:45:32.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
