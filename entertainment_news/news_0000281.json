He’s glad that his wife is beside him in a show about couples. “This is the first time I am taking on the host’s mantle and I am thrilled to do so with Malaika by my side. ‘Power Couple’ is an interesting format and I am glad we could do this together,” Arbaaz said in a statement. The Sony Entertainment Television’s upcoming reality show “Power Couple” is an Indian version of the hit Israeli show of the same name. The show will see 10 celebrity couples living under one roof and they will be tested as they face extreme challenges to prove how well they know each other. As hosts, the Bollywood duo will interact with the couples and will also be seen doling out some power advice. Arbaaz, whose latest Bollywood outing “Kis Kisko Pyaar Karoon” is doing well at the box office, also notes that he is hooked on to the international version of the show. “I have seen few episodes of the international show and I must say I am totally hooked on it.
