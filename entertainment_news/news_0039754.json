He is smitten from afar with Meera​ (Tannishtha Chatterjee), a divorced single parent whose mother (Supriya Pathak) is desperate for her to find a suitable Indian husband, preferably a doctor. Meera​ values her independence and tries to dodge her mother's machinations. For reasons that gradually emerge — not just her mother's disapproval — she also prefers to keep Will at a distance. \nUndeterred, he prevails on his childhood friend TK (Arka Das) to give him a vastly simplified crash course in all things Indian and embarks enthusiastically on the task of winning her over. \nAs a performer, Lee moves between the bashful and the enthusiastic, which mostly works well enough for the character. His co-star, Chatterjee, who was the lead in Sarah Gavron's Brick Lane (2007), is a relaxed, appealing presence.   \nDirector Anupam​ Sharma  presides over a film bristling with supporting characters and plotlines​ of varying success: a melodramatic subplot involving Meera's​ former husband feels way out of place and references to sponsors are decidedly unsubtle.\nIt's a film designed for broad-brush entertainment that tries to touch on some deeper issues: job discrimination, the problems that arise when people feel caught between two cultures, the notion of what it is to be Indian or \"un-Indian\". What it is to be Australian is more nebulous in this context: Will's Aussie English classes have a definitely retro feel, touching as they do on things like how to say \"g'day\" and the meaning of the term \"sheila\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:59:56.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
