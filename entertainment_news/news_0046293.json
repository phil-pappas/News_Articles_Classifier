Michael Fassbender Thinks Christian Bale Would Have Made A 'Perfect' Steve Jobs Michael Fassbender Christian Bale Steve Jobs Danny Boyle Kate Winslet \nFassbender scored the role of Jobs after Bale left the project last year. \nMichael Fassbender has admitted he thinks Christian Bale would have been ‘perfect’ to play Steve Jobs in Danny Boyle ’s biopic of the late Apple founder. Bale was originally signed on to the project but left last November, with Fassbender then being brought in as his replacement. Michael Fassbender at the Steve Jobs premiere. \nSpeaking to The Hollywood Reporter Fassbender said, \"I thought to myself: Christian Bale is perfect, why isn’t he doing it? I actually called him up and told him that myself.” \nBale’s exit from the film last year put the project in turmoil, with studio Sony then also pulling out. However the film was soon picked up by Universal, with Fassbender coming onboard as Jobs. \nMore: Danny Boyle's 'Steve Jobs' Biopic To Close London Film Festival \nFassbender also said that he believes his lack of physical resemblance to Jobs wont hamper audiences’ enjoyment of the film. \"I think audiences accept things when you lay them out for them,\" he said. \n“So you see at the beginning of the film that I don’t look anything like him, so you go: ok, he doesn’t look anything like him, we can get over that now and watch the movie.” \n“Biopics can be very much about impersonation, and that kind of overtakes the story at times,” the actor added. However Fassbender does think that he begins to resemble Jobs a little more as the movie goes on, especially when he dons the Apple founder’s famous turtleneck in the film’s third act. \n\"I wouldn’t say that I look like him, but there was more of a similarity there. So it kind of creeps up on the audience.\" The film was premiered at the New York Film Festival on Saturday and has so far gained positive reviews from critics. \nMore: Michael Fassbender Hopes Schoolchildren Will Be Inspired By His ‘Macbeth' \nWriting for CBS News , reviewer David Morgan wrote that while Fassbender does not look like Jobs, he manages to ‘infuse the character of Jobs with charisma and dynamism matched by petulance and threats’. \nSteve Jobs hits US theatres on October 9th and will be closing this year’s BFI London Film Festival on October 18th.
