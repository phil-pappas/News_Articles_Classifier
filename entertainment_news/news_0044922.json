(AP) — Artists from Michigan and New York each won $200,000 grand prizes Friday at the seventh annual ArtPrize, a competition that brought 1,550 entries to western Michigan. \nTextile artist Ann Loveless and her husband, photographer Steven Loveless, won the public vote for \"Northwood Awakening,\" a large photo print and quilt hybrid. It depicts a serene woodland panorama. \nAnn Loveless also won in 2013. The couple lives in Beulah, Michigan. \n\"Once again, reverence for technical skill in two-dimensional work — this time in a stunning combination of large-scale photography and intricate textile — has captured the imagination of the voting public,\" said Christian Gaines, ArtPrize executive director. \nGaines said she's \"stunned and delighted\" to have a repeat winner. \nSeparately, a jury of experts awarded a $200,000 grand prize to Kate Gilmore of New York for \"Higher Ground.\" She transformed a former Grand Rapids convent into performance art with women swinging on swings in open windows. \n\"Kate Gilmore's piece is really kind of magical in a way that we've maybe lost sight of,\" said juror Dan Cameron of New Orleans. \nThe event's total purse was $500,000. Other awards totaling $100,000 were given to winners in certain categories. There were 1,550 eligible works at ArtPrize from 48 countries and 42 U.S. states and territories. \nPublic votes were cast using the ArtPrize mobile app, online and via text message to determine the grand prize given to Ann and Steven Loveless. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:13:45.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
