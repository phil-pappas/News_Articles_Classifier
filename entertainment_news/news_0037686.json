It's not the way we are together.'' \nMeanwhile, Bradley thinks Amy Schumer is ''very attractive'' and is worried he creeped her out after she joked they were dating on 'Saturday Night Live' because he refused to let her leave his side at the Time 100 Gala last April. \nHe explained: ''All that stuff of her getting called and me saying no, no, no - that really happened. I thought I was getting a little creepy because I was making her stay.''
