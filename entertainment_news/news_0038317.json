Sharing her story with the world, she has created a family tradition that puts a magical spin on Halloween for all children. Included in each set is a Switch Witch plush toy that becomes a valued member of the family during the Halloween season, and a beautifully illustrated storybook that tells how the Switch Witch magically turns candy into energy to fuel her Witchy World – and how the reader's help is needed to do so!\nAudrey Kinsman , Head Witch, brewed up this allergy-friendly concept when one of her sons was trick-or-treating in 2013. After seeing his disappointment in knowing that he would not be able to eat most of the candy due to a food allergy, the idea of \"Switchcrafting\" the candy he was allergic to came to life. Good girls and boys trick-or-treat as usual, and then when they arrive home, are encouraged to choose their favorite pieces of candy to keep while giving the rest to their Switch Witch. The Switch Witch will then use her magic to \"Switchcraft\" the candy for a preferred book or toy – a win-win for both adults and children!\nAdditionally, The Switch Witches have partnered with Mommy Nearest, a mobile app service that strives to make parenting easier by bringing communities together, to host four candy drop-off play dates the first week of November. These events will be conducted at fun, family-friendly play spaces in Los Angeles , San Francisco , Chicago , and New York . There will also be four to five additional candy drop-off locations throughout each city, to make it easier for families to find a spot closest to them. The Switch Witches' mission will serve as a major focal point at these events as children bring in and donate a portion of their candy in exchange for a toy, book or other item. Kids and families will be making life a little sweeter for our military troops as all of the candy will then be donated to Operation Shoebox as a thank you for their dedication and service. Visit us here for more information on the play dates and drop-off locations.\n\"What began as an attempt to put the magic back in Halloween for my son, has truly become a Halloween tradition that can be enjoyed by thousands of families nationwide,\" Kinsman said. \"From parents of children with food allergies to those seeking to make Halloween healthier for their families, and to those who want to make their candy count as a thank you to our troops, The Switch Witch and the Magic of Switchcraft is the perfect solution for a new family tradition that makes life that much sweeter all around.\"\nThe Switch Witch and the Magic of Switchcraft is available nationwide at Target, PartyCity.com, and Von Maur for $29.99 . The Switch Witches website, www.SwitchWitches.com , also offers fun Halloween activities, craft ideas, cooking videos, grades K-5 worksheets and more for children, adults, and teachers!
