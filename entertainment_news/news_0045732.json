Reps. Nita Lowey of New York and Rose DeLauro of Connecticut want to eliminate a Republican provision in a fiscal 2016 spending bill that would bar \"any funds from being spent on gun research.’’\nLowey, ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, thinks the public supports federal spending on gun violence research.\n“Every day there are men and women dying from guns in every state of this country,’’ she said in an interview Wednesday. “Let’s figure it out and stop this violence.’’\nDemocratic Sen. Charles Schumer of New York agreed.\n\"It was put in the budget wrongly and should come out,’’ he said of the Republican provision.\nSchumer planned to join other Senate Democrats Thursday in announcing a legislative package to address gun violence. The proposals would close loopholes in background checks involving gun sales and impose new federal penalties for gun trafficking across state lines, among other changes.\nBoth those bills failed in early 2013, when Democrats made their last major effort to pass gun legislation in the wake of the December 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings that killed 20 students and 6 adults.\nNew York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a prime sponsor of the gun trafficking bill, plans to highlight its provisions in local events around the state Friday in Rochester, New Rochelle and on Long Island in Central Islip.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nCuomo urges Congress to act on gun control\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nGOP knocks Cuomo over gun-control stance\nGun legislation faces an uphill battle in Congress, where Republicans control the agenda, but the proposed ban on gun violence research could attract national attention.\nFederal funding for such research is limited and is conducted primarily through grants from the National Institute for Justice and the National Institutes of Health, according to Dr. Garen Wintemute, director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California-Davis.\n“We missed out on 20 years of concentrated efforts because federal funding was ended, Wintemute said. “So we don’t have answers to questions that we could have answered decades ago. And every time we try to address a problem like mass shooting or the question whether there should be background checks for all firearms purchases, we don’t have the evidence we could have.’’\nPresident Barack Obama issued an executive order in January 2013 to eliminate a 1996 congressional provision barring the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from spending money on research that could be used to advocate or promote gun control.\nAlthough the language didn't ban gun research outright, the CDC applied the restriction as if that were the case.\nCongress hasn’t specifically funded any gun violence research since Obama lifted the provision, even though gun deaths topped 33,000 in 2013, the most recent year for which data is available.\n“I would say that facing a health problem of this magnitude and knowing that the United States does well when faced by challenges, how can you continue to turn your back?’’ Wintemute said. “If we were talking about an infectious disease, we would mobilize.’’\nContact Brian Tumulty at btumulty@gannett.com Twitter: @NYinDC", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2e62ab9c3d33cceb8449cb97ceb4a838cdf6ccca/c=573-0-3308-2735/local/-/media/2015/10/02/Rochester/B9319104657Z.1_20151002204903_000_GI3C49CN3.6-0.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cf157592aa6fe60edb65b489d0aca03053a01e6f/c=28-0-321-293/local/-/media/2015/10/05/Rochester/wp-ROC-VoteUp-37175-cox2.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T04:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:04:18.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
