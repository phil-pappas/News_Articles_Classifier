In some cases, it isn’t even that they are bad songs. Some of them are tracks that I’ve heard too much and don’t enjoy much anymore.

(Photo: AFP/Getty Images) \nSometimes, my fanatical devotion to the music of the Beach Boys can give the impression that I think every bit of music they released is beyond reproach. \nIn fact, there are times when people have assumed (and fairly so) that I would love any song, any compilation, just because it is the Beach Boys. \nThe truth is, yeah, I do like most of their music. Even the “bad” stuff usually has something I can defend. For instance, I like at least four or five songs on the “Summer In Paradise” album (one of their most detested albums). I’m absolutely in love with the “Love You” album, the tooting synthesizers and all. \nBut there are some songs that I just don’t need to hear again. In some cases, it isn’t even that they are bad songs. Some of them are tracks that I’ve heard too much. As I’ve said before, burnout is very real . \nSo here we go, buckle up, this is my list of 10 Beach Boys songs that I don’t love. \n10. “Be True to Your School” from the “Little Deuce Coupe” album. \nThis is a fun song, a classic, a song that is guaranteed to please people in a live setting. Experiencing Mike Love’s prolonged introduction of “when” into “wh ” is something to behold in concert. But the song itself just doesn’t do much for me. I never really had a lot of school spirit in high school or college, so perhaps I just don’t relate to the vibe. \n9. “Louie, Louie” from the “Shut Down Volume 2” album. \nSome songs just shouldn’t be understandable. The charm of the hit “Louie, Louie” by the Kingsmen is the energy and the almost-indecipherable lyric as the performance goes along. Maybe it’s lewd, maybe it’s crude. How would you know? Great garage fun. The Beach Boys’ take on the song is sung where you can understand the lyrics (which are kinda pedestrian when you actually know what they are), kind of negating the manic power. The Beach Boys recording raises the question, why did they bother? For me, the song just kind of sits there. \n8. “Barbara Ann” from the “Party!” album. \nIt’s a hit song. It’s a song you’ll hear all the factions whip out in the concert setting. I’m gonna guess that most people know this song, if they know any Beach Boys recordings at all. I’ve heard it a million times and it just doesn’t move me anymore. I loved it when I was 15; I’m way, way over it at 35. I’m glad they recorded it and had a hit with it, and I don’t need to play it ever again. \n7. “Student Demonstration Time” from the “Surf’s Up” album. \nTopical, political matters, social issues. ... In the early 1970s, when it seemed like the U.S. was in one struggle after another, the Beach Boys released some music that seemed to address the times. Some folks really dig “SDT,” but I find it jarring and I think the lyrics are kind of a middle-of-the-road diversions that neither side with nor take stands against the students. The new degree, a “bachelor of bullets?” Kinda seems cold. And the next time there’s a riot, “you best stay out of sight?” Hmm. How revolutionary. I prefer the original song that this tune is based on, “Riot in Cell Block Number 9.” \n6. “Rock and Roll Music” from the “15 Big Ones” album. \nUgh. It was the biggest hit the Beach Boys had enjoyed since 1966’s “Good Vibrations,” which came 10 years before “Rock and Roll Music.” I’ve always found this recording (and the remixes of it) bloated and listless. Shouted vocals, the swaggering horns, it still seems to lack vitality and soul. The track grates on my ears. I tend to skip it whenever it comes on. Give me Chuck Berry’s original, or the Beatles’ cover. \n5. “Belles of Paris” from “M.I.U. Album.” \nMike Love has written some brilliant lyrics in his life and has co-written some of the best songs in the American music experience of the 20th century. But “Belles of Paris” does him no favors. Elementary rhyming, laughable attempts to sing French words and a hokey backing track really make this a stinker for me. \n4. “Here Comes the Night” from “L.A. (Light Album).” \nThe original version on 1967’s “Wild Honey” album is one of my favorite buried-jewel songs. And even the single version of this 1979 remake is enjoyable in its own right. But the album version is 11 minutes of tedious, sterile ear butchery. I like Carl Wilson’s vocal, but the vocals are a small part of the long recording. There is good disco and bad disco (yeah, I said it, there’s good disco), and this isn’t good disco. \n3. “Passing Friend” from the “The Beach Boys” album. \nFive minutes of music is about four minutes too long for this Culture Club donation. I guess I can take some relief that the Beach Boys didn’t tackle “Do You Really Want to Hurt Me” or “Karma Chameleon.” Still, the lyrics are listless and the performance never goes anywhere. The 1980s production really sticks out, too. Carl Wilson’s voice, usually able to lift the mundane to something special, can’t bring life to this turkey (though he did try, bless his soul). \n2. “Forever” from the “Summer in Paradise” album. \nDennis Wilson’s best-known song, and one of the many highlights on the 1970 “Sunflower” album, deserves better treatment than this. I’m honestly not knocking John Stamos. In fact, I think it was on an episode of the “Full House” TV show that I was first introduced to the song. But once you’ve heard the original recording , the rerecording featuring Stamos stands as an unnecessary revisit. Stamos’ smooth tones can’t match Wilson’s yearning sincerity. And the video for the Stamos version is ... well, you have to see it to believe it. \n1. “Summer of Love” from the “Summer in Paradise” album. \nIt’s rare for me to dismiss a song as being completely awful. Like, irredeemably awful. I can usually find something to at least give a silver lining to whatever dark cloud a song can conjure. “Well, the vocal was good.” “I liked the guitar lick.” “It has a good beat.” “Fun instrumentation on that one.” Not so with this song. It is one of those songs that almost belongs on a novelty record. And I’m sure it has its fans. But hearing Mike Love’s rap (kind of falling in a “Rico Suave” kind of come-hither tone), and noticing the lyrics ... Love offers to take a girl on a “love vacation,” and the “doing unto others is the Golden Rule, but doing it with you would be so very cool” is the ultimate in cringe-worthy moments. But we can take some solace, as the song could have been worse. I’ve read that the original intention was for Bart Simpson to duet with Love on the song. Bullet dodged there. I guess. \nAs an honorable mention, I’ll note the Beach Boys’ cover of “Crocodile Rock.” It was released on a tribute album to Elton John. I don’t think that album was widely purchased or heard, so I’m letting “Crocodile Rock” off the hook since it probably didn’t get the chance to attack as many eardrums as the other songs did. But yikes. That’s another cover that really should have never happened. \nSo, there you have it. I don’t listen to every Beach Boys song with nothing but love and devotion in my heart. Some folks will ding “Kokomo,” but I’ve got fun childhood memories with that one, and I think Carl Wilson’s vocal is phenomenal. \nNow, if you’ll excuse me, I need to cleanse my palette. I think I’ll pop in “The Beach Boys Today!” Barring the track “Bull Session with the ‘Big Daddy,’ ” that album is solid gold. \nThis is the opinion of music enthusiast and occasional Beach Boys apologist Chris Shields.
