Of course there is no such thing,” she explained. \nBut the 45-year-old star said humans have an inherent need to find a mate. Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig (Charles Sykes/Invision) \n“I think human beings are naturally inclined to be with another person. I mean there are people who choose to be single and I guess there are nuns and Buddhist monks who devote themselves to some spiritual power, but human beings do naturally tend to couple up.” \nRachel said she was taken aback by Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos, who directed The Lobster, and his way of working because she wasn’t given any information about her role before shooting. Yorgos Lanthimos and Rachel Weisz (Evan Agostini/Invision) \n“I’d seen Yorgos’ previous films and I wanted to work with him and sought him out so had a sense of the strangeness and originality that this film might be,” she said. \n“It was still surprising though when I saw how very imaginative and unlike any other film it is. It’s a mixture of very liberating and quite scary in that you can’t use the tools you normally rely on to prepare for a role so no research, nothing. Just had to turn up and do it.” \nRachel also said it is time that women are represented on the big screen more. Rachel Weisz and Colin Farrell (Ian West/PA) \n“I don’t know the statistics of how many movies have women as leads in but I guess it’s pretty low,” she said. \n“We’re not a tiny disenfranchised minority. We make up 50-51 percent of planet Earth so I think it’s important… Also that women want to go and see films where the stories are about a female character.” Share article \nThe Lobster opens in UK cinemas on Friday, October 16.
