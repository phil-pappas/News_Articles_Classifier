NYC World Premiere on Aug. 13, 2014, in New York. Brian Ach/Getty Images for Feld Entertainment Shares More + \nKatie Holmes always looks glamorous , even when she's catching the train. \nThe 36-year-old actress instagrammed a cute photo of her hiking up a gorgeous, strapless red gown and sporting matching red heels at Penn Station in New York City on Thursday, giving a whole new meaning to traveling in style. \n\"Heels and a train...nothing better #newyork #pennstation,\" she wrote. A photo posted by Katie Holmes (@katieholmes212) on Oct 7, 2015 at 9:31pm PDT Watch: Katie Holmes shows skin in super tiny denim minidress while filming at Walmart \nA source tells ET that the glam pic is actually from a photoshoot for a magazine taken over a year ago, and that the whole idea was actually hers. \n\"She was at a shoot for a magazine and thought it would be interesting to do a shot in a train ... so she went down to Penn Station to take some pictures in her gown on the NJ Transit,\" the source says. \"It was all rogue -- her idea.\" \nBut Holmes showed a completely different side of herself in August, when she showed some skin in an acid wash denim minidress at Walmart on the set of \"All We Had,\" her directorial debut. The film revolves around a mother who struggles to make a better life for her daughter. \nHolmes shocked again later that month on the New York set, looking dramatically different while holding a gun in minimal makeup .
