I'm making up with myself. Making up for lost time. Making up for everything I ever did and never did. But I haven't got time to hold onto the crumbs of my past like I used to. What's done is done. \n\"Turning 25 was a turning point for me, slap bang in the middle of my twenties. Teetering on the edge of being an old adolescent and a fully-fledged adult, I made the decision to go into becoming who I'm going to be forever without a removal van full of my old junk ... \n\"The ability to be flippant about everything and there be no consequences. Even following and breaking rules is better than making the rules. 25 is about getting to know who I've become without realising. And I'm so sorry it took so long, but you know, life happened.\" \nShe went on to explain how she felt she was always \"wishing [her] life away\" until she turned 18 and now wishes she could \"blag\" being seen as younger than 27-years-old. \nShe continued: \"When I was 7, I wanted to be 8. When I was 8, I wanted to be 12. When I turned 12 I just wanted to be 18. Then after that I stopped wanting to be older. Now I'm ticking 16-24 boxes just to see if I can blag it! I feel like I've spent my whole life so far wishing it away. \n\"Always wishing I was older, wishing I was somewhere else, wishing I could remember and wishing I could forget too. Wishing I hadn't ruined so many good things because I was scared or bored. \n\"Wishing I wasn't so matter of fact all the time. Wishing I'd gotten to know my great grandmother more, and wishing I didn't know myself so well, because it means I always know what's going to happen. Wishing I hadn't cut my hair off, wishing I was 5'7\". Wishing I'd waited and wishing I'd hurried up as well.\" adele", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:28:49.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
