We’ve been taking them on and off during rehearsals. I can’t wear them for eight hours straight.” For these actors, no pain, no gainful employment. It’s all in service of a play made even more fascinating because it’s based on a true story. Written by Harvey Fierstein, “Casa Valentina” follows a group of heterosexual men who convene in a resort in the Catskills in 1962 so that they can dress and behave as women. The tranquility of the retreat is threatened by the possibility that the discreet group may get some unwanted exposure. The play seems like a timely choice for SpeakEasy as Caitlyn Jenner has reignited conversations about gender identity. “We’ve talked about Caitlyn Jenner in rehearsal,” says McGarrahan, “but this is really different.” He points out that these cross-dressers don’t want to surgically become women. It’s a reminder of the many shades of gender expression. “It’s not simple, it’s complex,” says Derrah, who lives in Cambridge. “Life isn’t just boys and girls, and blue and pink. We know that more and more now. It’s a fun play, but if we can also shed light on the diversity of human beings, then that’s terrific.” Asked why their characters feel the desire to cross-dress, the actors can’t really come up with an answer. It’s a mystery that’s not solved by the play. “We have to imagine ourselves in this world,” says McGarrahan. “You do your research, but at a certain point, you’re on your own. Asked why they cross-dress, many of them don’t have an answer, they have a story. I don’t think I’ll ever understand the core of these guys, but that’s OK. As actors, we’re asked to do things like this all the time. I also don’t know what it’s like to want to murder someone, but I can play a murderer, too.” The “girls” in the play are having fun, so it’s important that the actors have fun, too. Being part of a cast always requires a high level of trust between the actors, perhaps never more so than the first time in rehearsal when you don a wig and a dress. “Whenever you’re asked to do something onstage that’s out of the ordinary, trust is very important,” says McGarrahan. “But everyone in the cast is supportive and fun. There’s a clubiness to it.” Both Derrah and McGarrahan have played other roles that required them to cross-dress on stage. Derrah performed “I Am My Own Wife” and he was also cast as Fraulein Schneider in “Cabaret.” Although those were serious roles, men who dress as women on stage are usually going for something campy or silly. Not here. “The goal for these guys was to pass [for women],” says McGarrahan. “They wanted to look like the lady down the street. They didn’t want to look glamorous, but they also didn’t want to look campy. They wanted to look like they just got up from playing bridge. They wished they could go out in public and no one would notice. That was the goal, but it wasn’t easily accomplished.” As you listen to the actors discuss the process of their transformations and the “look” of their female alter-egos, it might remind you of Dustin Hoffman in “Tootsie”: Men suddenly talking about female fashion, and taking it seriously. Derrah says that, stylistically, his character, Valentina, has a Connie Francis thing going on. Or, a more modern analogy would be someone like Stockard Channing. And it’s kind of a hoot to hear McGarrahan say that he and the designers are shooting for a Chanel- inspired look for his character of Charlotte. And he likes the fact that, at this point in rehearsals, she’s a blonde. “She looks like she’s a lot of fun, and she is,” says the actor. “But who knows? By the time we open the show, maybe she’ll have long black hair and she’ll be wearing an A-line skirt.” Whatever the final decision, she’ll probably look pretty good, Derrah said. He’s seen plenty of dressing in rehearsal, and he thinks the cast will impress. He says some of the actors will look “very, very good. I’m not going to say beautiful,” he adds with a laugh, “but very, very good.” Theater preview: CASA VALENTINA By Harvey Fierstein. Directed by Scott Edmiston.
