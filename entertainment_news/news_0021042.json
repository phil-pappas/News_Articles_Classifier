He has done this to participate in a competition organized by YES foundation. The movie is about Bangalore-based 'Braille' Babu, who transcribes books for the visually challenged people. Blaaze says, \"About a year ago, my brother-in-law Uday Jayaram, told me about Babu, who had been transcribing books for the visually challenged for more than 27 years. His books have even helped a girl get admission to Boston University, USA. I realized that this was the story that I wanted to tell.\" According to the competition's rule, Blaaze had to complete this film within 101 hours. So he shot the film in GoPro, edited it and uploaded it in 'everyday heroes' category of the competition.\nHe adds, \"I see Babu as a hero. Though he is visually challenged, he still manages to accomplish his dreams. So I chose to upload this film in 'everyday heroes' category instead of submitting the film in the 'specially abled' section. And we thought that this would be an inspiration to the youngsters. We have now received a lot of messages and comments from many saying that the story inspired them.\"\nAbout trying his hand in filmmaking he says, \"Ever since I completed BA Cinema from Columbia College back in 1999, I've always been fascinated by films. However, when I got busy with rapping, my dream of directing a film took a backseat. Now I am slowly getting into filmmaking. Recently I acted in Karthik Raaja's play Pattanathil Bootham as a Rap Saamiyar. I worked on the promo shoots for this play and I ended up shooting and editing those visuals for the promos. It was fun working in such projects. \"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:17:08.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
