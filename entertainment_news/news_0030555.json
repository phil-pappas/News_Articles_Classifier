The beloved show is known for its timeless tunes, such as “Ol’ Man River,” “Can't Help Lovin’ Dat Man” and “Make Believe.” \nIt’s also known for the way in which it illuminates the racial and social changes that were shaping the country from 1890 to 1927. For example, an interracial couple in the story finds its illegal for them to perform together in certain parts of the South. \nJerome Kern wrote the music for “Show Boat,” while its book and lyrics are by Oscar Hammerstein II . This new production is directed and choreographed by Richard Stafford , with musical direction by Ryan Wise . \nWestchester Broadway Theatre is presenting this show through Sunday, Nov. 29, with a returning engagement from Wednesday, Dec. 30, through Sunday, Jan. 31. \n“Show Boat” opened on Broadway at the Ziegfeld Theatre on Dec. 27, 1927, and was a great success. It has been revived numerous times — most successfully by Hal Prince in 1994. Two film versions were also produced by MGM. \nWestchester Broadway Theatre, 1 Broadway Plaza, Elmsford, N.Y.
