Spic. Half-breed. And on the night he graduated from high school, cornered in a pizzeria, a group of guys dragged him into the street and beat out of him any sense of belonging to the country where he was born and raised. “You just don’t feel like you belong anywhere,” he said. “You really and completely feel displaced.” Fractured identity is one of the themes Fontaine explores in “Mi America,” the longtime actor and filmmaker’s made-in-Newburgh film which made its world premiere on Friday in New York City. The discovery of five murdered Latino migrant laborers in a small, economically-depressed waterfront city ignites a voyage of self-examination for the Latino detective assigned to solve the case, played by Fontaine, and for the people who consider immigrants a threat to their perceived way of life. It is a fictional take on a real-life immigration drama with characters like Donald Trump and Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, anti-immigrant hate groups and victims such as Luis Ramirez, the Mexican man beaten to death by teenagers in Shenandoah, Pa. in 2008 “It’s just addressing all these issues and trying to open up a dialogue and seeing how we can move forward as a nation of diversity and not like try to condemn people for taking the opportunity to put food on their table,” he said. Village East Cinema in New York City is screening “Mi America” for at least a week before the film moves to Los Angeles and then a nationwide release. The roughly $2 million project is the third film Fontaine has completed since he grew disillusioned with an acting career filled with television and movie roles and decided to make character-driven films about subjects he considered important. “I just got tired of playing stereotypes,” he said. Fontaine, who has a resume filled with television and film roles, began shooting “Mi America” in July 2013, the year after he and his wife settled on Newburgh as the place to buy an upstate getaway spot from Brooklyn. Drawing him to the city were its conflicting combinations: beautiful buildings and streets flowing into blight; a racially diverse populace trying to rend financial stability out of an economically-depressed city and expatriates from New York City fueling a small renaissance. He plans to film his next three projects in Newburgh, Fontaine said. “My hope is to establish a thriving film community there,” he said. “I really want to put Newburgh back on the back.” lsparks@th-record.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:04:27.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
