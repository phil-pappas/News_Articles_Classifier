The couple kept it a secret until now and couldn't help sharing the happy moment when met on the set of his music video \"Work\". To PEOPLE , the Gnarls Barkley member shared about the moment he proposed, \"It was just a typical night at the studio, but then again, not so typical cause I did something extra special, out of the ordinary.\" \"I went and purchased a ring that we had seen together, maybe four or five months or so prior,\" he continued. \"I went back and purchased the ring and I just kind of had it stashed away in some old equipment. And I said, 'Will you reach in there and grab something for me?' \" Shani said of the ring, \"It was the most beautiful diamond ring I had ever seen in my life. It was lit up by a light.\" She also recalled how she reacted to the sweet and beautiful surprise, \"I said, 'What is that?' He just looked at me and said, 'Well...?' And I was just like 'Oh my goodness.' \" She added, \"I said, 'Babe, I can't believe it.' He said, 'You've been such a good woman. You're such and amazing person. You're my life partner. You're my best friend. I want to share the rest of my life with you.' \" On why they decided not to announce it until now, Cee-Lo said, \"Truth be told, it's not something we wanted to promote. We're a collective power together because our private life is sacred. But you know what though, maybe it's time. Maybe it is time for the world to know that I have a very secure situation and a loving woman supporting me the entire way.\" The former coach of \" The Voice \" also gushed about his fiancee, \"I appreciate her openness and willingness to love unconditionally. She's been so sweet to me through a number of different trials that come to test the resilience of a union to deem whether it's worthy or not, whether it's durable or strong enough.\" The couple claimed they hadn't begun planning the wedding, but Cee-Lo said he would be actively involved when the time comes. \"I'm a pretty hands on person,\" he said. \"We'll be prepared to be spontaneous.\" Cee-Lo was previously married to Christina Johnson from 2000-2005. They have a son together, 15-year-old Kingston. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:44:52.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
