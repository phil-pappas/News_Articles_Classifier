Australia is very far away and I’m a mummy who lives in England with three children, so I send my deepest apologies. I had an amazing time making The Dressmaker .”\nAdvertisement Hugo Weaving, also in the comedy-drama set in the early 1950's in a tiny country town, attempted to define the film’s genre and style for Fairfax Media.\n“It’s fabulously bold. A very Australian-style Western with a dark, revenge tone to it. It’s an unusual hybrid film that will please a lot of people. It’s pretty cool.”\nHe also sought to respond to reports that his close mate Cate Blanchett is moving overseas. ‘They’ve had many different plans. Every five minutes a different plan - to go to England, Scotland, the States, New Zealand, Vanuatu (they’ve got a place in Vanuatu).\nBut I don’t actually know what they’re settling on at this stage.” Meanwhile 25 year old Liam, who recently posted a photo of his mother on social media with the caption “best Mum in the world” (sic), reflected on the importance of family, as his parents Leonie and Craig watched on proudly.\n“Both my parents were the biggest supporters of anything we wanted to do. We grew up in such a happy, safe environment where we could really feel comfortable trying to live out this crazy job.”\nThe Dressmaker , directed by Jocelyn Moorhouse ( Muriel’s Wedding , Proof ) and filmed in eight weeks mainly in country Victoria, also stars Sarah Snook, Barry Otto, Judy Davis, Rebecca Gibney, Alison Whyte, Gyton Grantley and Shane Jacobson. \nChris Hemsworth at the premiere of ‘The Dressmaker’ in Melbourne, Australia, 18th October 2015 pic.twitter.com/zSVvZcSYs0 \n— CHRIS HEMSWORTH fan (@CHRISHEMSWORT66) October 18, 2015 The Dressmaker opens at Australian cinemas on October 29.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T00:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T05:22:45.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
