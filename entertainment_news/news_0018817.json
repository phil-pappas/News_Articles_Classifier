The film has a quirky subject — OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder). Interestingly, the film has no negative characters as each and every character has a negative shade in it. I personally feel that we have teamed up as we have a special V connection — Victor is the director, Varun is the hero, Vedhika is the heroine, the movie's name is Vinodan and I play a character called Vishva and incidentally, I have also got a 'V' tattoo on me. I think all of us have OCD. I am a cleanliness freak, so is Vedhika. The producer said that he liked the script just because he saw some of his traits in the characters that Victor narrated. In fact, a doctor explained to us what the condition actually is, so that we can understand the script better,\" says Jegan.\nHe will also be seen in a crucial role in Kamal's upcoming film, Thoongaavanam. \"You have to watch the film carefully otherwise you will miss my part. My role is that small. But, I accepted it as I am a big fan of Kamal. During my college days, I have bunked and watched his films. Also, when director Rajesh narrated the script, I loved it. I work for Prakash Raj, the villain in the film. The story revolves around a kidnap and I am part of the villain's group. I worked for eight days with Kamal during the shooting and in those days, I saw him singing, enacting a mimicry and he shared a lot of things about films with me. I must say that of all the movies that I have done so far, this will be my most memorable film — because of the Ulaganayagan,\" he says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:19:27.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
