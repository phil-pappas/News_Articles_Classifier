Interested buyers have already reserved more than half of the 19 homes in this distinctive neighborhood. The Village at Silverleaf Villas and Cottages will range in size from 2,735 to 4,468 square feet and prices start at $2,325,000. Groundbreaking for this luxury community is slated for end of 2015.\nDesigned to be “jewel boxes” set adjacent to the world-renowned Silverleaf Clubhouse, the first tee and the driving range, Cullum Homes’ newest homes offer a totally engaging lifestyle. Twelve semi-custom Villas and seven Club Cottages, designed by world renowned Oz Architects and constructed by Cullum, will closely reflect the architecture of the Clubhouse and be clustered in the heart of DC Ranch’s renowned Silverleaf community.\nThe Village offers buyers a totally unique resort lifestyle within Silverleaf. Just a short distance from the Silverleaf clubhouse, homeowners will live connected to the social and cultural hub of the community. “These homes offer an enviable lifestyle of ease and access,” said Mike Sweeney, Designated Broker of Silverleaf Realty. With just a limited number of these golf course properties, demand has been strong in the early design phase.\n“Working in partnership with Don Ziebell’s team at Oz, we have created a series of homes that feel elegant, timeless and totally personal. These homes offer more than design though, we have created a lifestyle unlike anything else in Silverleaf,” said Rod Cullum, one of the founders of Cullum Homes. “The early response to these homes demonstrates how ready families are for a connected lifestyle.”\nDon Ziebell, the founder and president of Oz Architects, collaborated on the design of The Village with Cullum Homes. One of the country’s most notable design professionals, Ziebell was also the architect of the Silverleaf Clubhouse and Spa ten years ago and today he has extended that luxury and craftsmanship into this unique series of homes.\nZiebell has earned an international reputation for design and his local work includes some of the premier destinations in the Valley - The Royal Palms Resort and Spa in Phoenix, The Hermosa Inn Paradise Valley, and Seven Canyons in Sedona. For DMB, Ziebell has also led the design teams of its signature clubs at Kukui’ula Plantation Clubhouse and Spa in Kauai, Hawaii and Glenwild Golf Club in Park City, Utah.\nSince its opening in 2003, Silverleaf has seen strong demand and sales in the community. This neighborhood is the final new single family phase in Silverleaf.
