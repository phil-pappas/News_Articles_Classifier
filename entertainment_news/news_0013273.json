Kerry said many... on.aol.com According to Politico, the landmark free-trade agreement, called the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) , was reached in Atlanta following nine days of talks that went through the night Saturday as trade officials broke a deadlock over the length of monopoly protections for new, cutting-edge drugs. A total of 12 nations (the United States, Canada and 10 other Pacific-Rim nations) have cinched the biggest trade deal in recent history.\nIt looks as if a congressional vote will be months away, next February at the earliest or later if Obama waits for final details to be ironed out before he gives Congress the legally mandated 90-days’ notice that he intends to sign it. A good point made by supporters is that this pact would tear down barriers to trade and raise labor and environmental standards among nations that represent about 40 percent of world economic output. However, it must be approved by Congress in an up-or-down vote as well as by the governments of 11 other countries.\nThere seems to be pros and cons with Congress on both sides of the aisle beginning with Senator and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who came out immediately stating his stance and encouraging Americans to beware. According to Bernie Sanders, Wall Street and big corporations have won a big victory to advance a disastrous trade deal. The TPP would expand the same failed \"free trade\" policies to 12 other nations that have already cost millions of jobs and shuttered tens of thousands of factories across the United States. Sanders further states that if TPP passes, it will further hurt consumers and cost American jobs. The TPP follows in the footsteps of other unfettered free trade agreements like NAFTA and CAFTA that have been supported by corporate America and that cost America millions of decent-paying jobs.\nBernie Sanders is quite vocal in stating that since 2001, nearly 60,000 manufacturing plants in this country have been shut down, and we have lost almost 5 million decent-paying manufacturing jobs. NAFTA alone led to the loss of almost three-quarters of a million jobs — the Permanent Normalized Trade Agreement with China cost America four times that number: almost 3 million jobs. These agreements are not the only reason why manufacturing in the United States has declined, but they are important factors.\nRead the article, “Deal reached on giant 12-nation trade pact” by Doug Palmer (Politico) to start putting the pieces together in order for “we the people” to decide our position to dictate to our representatives from all 50 states in both chambers what we want to happen and/or how it happens by the majority of the people in the United States. As 2016 is a major election year, all American eyes that are registered to vote will be watching closely to see if our representatives in the Senate and the House show their interest first in the people of the USA.", "external_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Republic–Central_America_Free_Trade_Agreement", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Partnership", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement", "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/landmark-free-trade-agreement-reached-in-atlanta-214421"], "published": "2015-10-06T00:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:45:38.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
