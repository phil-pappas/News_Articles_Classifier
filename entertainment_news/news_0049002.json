Majed al Mansoori, chairman of state-owned Tourism Development and Investment Company (TDIC), said authorities were now aiming for late 2016.\n\"Attention will now turn to the remaining work on the underside of the cladding and the Louvre Abu Dhabi remains on track for opening in the second half of 2016,‚Äù he told Reuters by email.\nHe did not give a reason for the delay in building work at the $650 million project, which is part of the wealthy emirate's wider plan to boost the tourist credentials of a country heavily dependent on oil.\nA building boom in the United Arab Emirates has created bottlenecks as some construction firms scramble to find labor, supplies and financing to complete huge backlogs of work.\nTDIC is developing a cultural district in Abu Dhabi which will house branches of the Louvre and Guggenheim museums, as well as the Zayed National Museum.\nThe Guggenheim has been scheduled to open in 2017 and the Zayed in 2016. Mansoori did not clarify whether those targets were still in force but said contracts for both museums would be awarded soon, with ground-breaking for the Zayed expected by the end of 2015 and at the Guggenheim in the first half of 2016.\n(Editing by Andrew Torchia and Helen Popper )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T20:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T20:34:34.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
