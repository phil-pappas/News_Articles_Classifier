Ditto the cleft chin and piercing blue eyes. Who else could play Superman? He was actually cast as the DC superhero the last time the series got a reboot, but the McG \"Flyby\" version fell apart. Instead, Bryan Singer's \"Superman Returns\" took flight with Brandon Routh in the lead. At age 16, he was a rugby-playing extra in the background for a scene in Russell Crowe's film \"Proof of Life.\" Since \"Gladiator\" was his favorite film, Cavill asked for a bit of advice on becoming an actor. Crowe was quickly mobbed and a heroically inclined young Cavill quickly acted as bodyguard. The Oscar winner sent the thoughtful lad a goodie bag and some good advice. Fast-forward to them both being cast in \"Man of Steel\" -- Cavill didn't mention the encounter to Crowe (who plays Jor-El), until well into filming. He didn't pick up the phone when Zack Snyder rang to tell him he'd gotten the coveted part because he was in the middle of a game of World of Warcraft. In \"Immortals,\" he played Theseus, a peasant with godlike fighting abilities who takes on a crazed villain bent on world domination: Clearly great practice for playing the invincible son of Jor-El. (In mythology, Theseus is the son of a God, but in the 2011 film, he was merely \"chosen\" by the gods.) As he told Media Geek Network: \"I had a very bold imagination and still do. I have never set limits on myself... I just wanted to go for the very big things. From the very beginning I didn’t want to settle for small stuff; I wanted to aim high and go down in a blaze of glory if I didn’t make it and try something else.\" When asked by Collider if he dressed as Superman as a child, he said: Yeah! Yeah, I think all of my brothers did at some stage. I’ve even got photos of my little nephews in Superman outfits. Apparently, they went to school when I first heard the news. One of them was wearing a little Superman outfit and the teacher sort of told them off and then spoke to my sister-in-law after, saying, 'I don’t know what’s going on with the boys. I don’t know what you’ve been telling them. They’ve been lying to me, because they’re telling me that their uncle is Superman and frankly it’s ridiculous.' Which brought my sister-in-law out there and she said, 'Actually, it’s not ridiculous; he is [Superman]. So you’ve got to let them wear their little outfits. Thank you very much.' [laughs] He proved he can fly (sort of) in the Jason Bourne wannabe \"The Cold Light of Day,\" in a scene in which he jumps off a roof and survives. In the 2001 movie \"Laguna,\" he played an orphan whose parents died in a fiery crash, which he relived in this feverish scene. Even more aptly for the future Superman, his character was exiled to the U.S. because his parents' death was actually a mob hit. He proved he could pull off a cape on \"The Tudors,\" even if it was black velvet. And, when he wasn't completely shirtless, he donned a cape or two in \"Immortals.\" During his time on \"The Tudors,\" his character, Charles Brandon, the 1st Duke of Suffolk, served on King Henry VII's influential Privy Council. He was also exiled temporarily from Henry's court, which is one of the few things this oft-naked character has in common with the Man of Steel. Everyone seems to be talking about how Cavill's not just embodying a good guy, he really is a good guy. As GQ put it, \"there’s an earnestness that borders on innocence,\" about him. If he hadn't become an actor, he'd be in the military, he told GQ. Two of his older brothers were in the armed forces, including one in the Royal Marines. “There’s an honesty to the job,” he told the magazine. “It’s something my heart and soul sing to do. Getting stuck in and the camaraderie between soldiers... there’s just something about it that feels natural to me. You know, whenever I see those ‘Be The Best’ Army adverts, a part of me goes, ‘I wish..'\"  Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T15:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:58:37.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
