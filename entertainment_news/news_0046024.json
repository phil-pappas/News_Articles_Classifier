A professional pumpkin carver, Bierton will chisel, shave, cut and shape pumpkins for 12 hours a day in his Brooklyn home's basement studio, called the dungeon because it is below ground and has no cell reception.\nBierton recently put his carving skills to the test in Halloween Wars , a four-episode reality competition that is now in its fifth season on the Food Network. It started with five teams. Each team had three randomly assigned artists — a pumpkin carver, cake decorator and sugar artist. Bierton was teamed up with sugar artist Robert Teddy and cake creator Darci Rochau to comprise the Scream Team.\nHis team won two of the first three elimination challenges to advance to the finale, which will air Sunday at 9 p.m. The prize is $50,000 for the team; the money would come in handy for Bierton as he and his wife are expecting their first child.\nBierton started carving pumpkins while growing up in Rochester.\n\"I love Halloween,” Bierton said. “It’s always been my favorite holiday.\"\nHe would carve a pumpkin every year, including during his years as a visual arts major at the School of the Arts. After graduating in 2001, he honed his skills as a 3-D artist by apprenticing with local artists Paul Knoblauch in metals and Elizabeth Lyons in glass.\nOver the years, his pumpkin creations became more and more elaborate. When he moved to Brooklyn in 2012, he joined Maniac Pumpkin Carvers , a Brooklyn-based arts studio that specializes in sophisticated, detailed pumpkin creations. If you've ever watched a sports event that shows pumpkins carved with realistic portraits of the athletes, it was likely created by Maniac Pumpkin Carvers.\nBierton landed his spot on Halloween Wars through his association with the group. The show was his first experience on reality television.\nThe show filmed from sunup until sundown, and afterward the trio would strategize during down time at their hotel.\n\"Some of the other teams were having a good time,\" Bierton said. \"We worked our butts off for everything we did.”\n\"The only reason we made it to the finals is that I gelled so well with the other artists,\" Bierton said. “I base a lot of our success on how well we jived together. They were just great.\"\nOf Bierton's contributions to the team's Halloween-themed displays, he is proudest of the realistic trash bag he carved for a \"hybrid horror\" challenge in the third episode.\n\"They ended up coming out so realistic, it was crazy,” he said. \"The judges were going absolutely bonkers.\"\nThe finale will feature Elvira as guest judge.\n\"It was great to meet her and have her judge our work,” he said.\nOnce pumpkin season is over, Bierton will turn his competitive spirit toward another passion — styling his mustache. He has won best styled mustache in New York City, and placed third in a national competition. He fulfilled a promise to his fiancee to shave off his mustache for a wedding, but it will be competition ready soon.\n\"I am very competitive by nature,\" he said. \"I compete with myself on a daily basis.”\nWeekend appearances\nBierton will give a pumpkin carving demonstration from 11 a.m. to noon Saturday at Wambach's Garden Center, 2590 Culver Road. That will be followed by a \"Learn to Carve Like a Pro\" class from noon to 3 p.m. The cost of the class is $50 at the door and is open to all skill levels and ages. Call (585) 342-7120 for details.\nBierton, along with friends, family and other supporters will gather at Enright’s Thirst Parlor, 582 Monroe Ave., to watch the Halloween Wars finale on Sunday. The show airs at 9 p.m.; the group will begin to gather an hour or two earlier. The public is welcome to join the gathering.\nTSCHUHMACH@Gannett.com", "external_links": ["http://www.lyonsglass.com/", "http://www.maniacpumpkincarvers.com/", "http://paulknoblauch.com/", "http://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/halloween-wars.html"], "published": "2015-10-22T23:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:02:17.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
