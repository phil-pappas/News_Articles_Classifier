She will also make personal appearances on the company's behalf. \nFor her part, Winfrey has the right to use Weight Watchers marks to collaborate with and promote the company, its programs, products and services. Winfrey will consult with Weight Watchers and help in the development, planning and execution of its program and related initiatives. \n\"We are expanding our purpose from focusing on weight loss alone to more broadly helping people lead a healthier, happier life,\" said Weight Watchers President and CEO Jim Chambers said in a written statement. \nWinfrey is buying approximately 6.4 million shares of Weight Watchers at $6.79 per share. She will also receive options to buy an additional 5 percent of the company's fully diluted shares. \nThe New York-based company's board expands from nine to 10 members with Winfrey's inclusion. \nThe agreement has additional successive one-year renewal terms.
