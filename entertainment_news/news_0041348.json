He was 75.\nHis prominent French Quarter restaurant, K-Paul's Louisiana Kitchen, confirmed the news Thursday morning with Gambit although the cause of death is unknown.\nPrudhomme was an internationally-acclaimed celebrity chef known for his skill in creole and cajun cuisine. He opened K-Paul's in 1979, introducing the greater portion of the United States and the world to rural Louisiana cooking.\nThe celebrity chef published several cookbooks, released a collection of spices and appeared frequently on cooking shows and other television programs throughout his career.\n\"Chef Paul Prudhomme changed forever the way Louisiana food is regarded in the world,\" local food historian Poppy Tooker told Gambit. \"He had such an incredible influence on our cuisine that you could find a touch of Paul on restaurant plates across the city and the country today.\"\nIsaac Toups, a fellow New Orleans-based chef, wrote a message of condolences after hearing the news. Sharing a photo of Prudhomme on Instagram, Toups wrote \"We lost a culinary legend today.\"\nPrudhomme was born the youngest of 13 children in Opelousas, La., on July 13, 1940. In 2012, he was honored as a Pioneer of American cuisine by the Culinary Institute of America and was a well-known philanthropist.\n YouTube star Caleb Logan Bratayley remembered in live memorial service Jim Carrey 'shocked and deeply saddened' by girlfriend Cathriona White's death Harrison Ford's plane crash caused by mechanical failure", "external_links": ["http://www.fox8live.com/story/30217322/chef-paul-prudhomme-dies-at-75", "https://instagram.com/p/8lahllACdP/", "https://facebook.com/unitedpress", "http://www.bestofneworleans.com/blogofneworleans/archives/2015/10/08/paul-prudhomme-pioneering-louisiana-chef-dies-at-75", "https://www.facebook.com/UnitedPress", "http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/08/entertainment/paul-prudhomme-obit/"], "published": "2015-10-08T23:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:19:35.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
