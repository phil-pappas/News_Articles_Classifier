(Brian Kelly/bkelly@al.com) B.Kelly \nAlabama was trouncing Georgia. Auburn was battling San Jose State. \nAnd there was a bit of trash talking, too. \nBut it was all in good fun. Dozens of televisions were blaring with the roar of fans and the the smell of barbecue on the air as hundreds of people attended the annual Tailgate on the Key at The Sports Bar in Perdido Key, Fla. on Saturday afternoon at The Sports Bar and Restaurant. \nOwner Judy Davis spared no expense and set up more than a dozen tents in the parking lot, some themed after a SEC teams and NFL teams. \n\"I'm really happy with the turnout. Really didn't know what to expect but this is a great turnout,\" Davis said. \nMusician T-Bone Montgomery was working hard but not on the guitar. \n\"I'm just holding it down here on the barbecue and happy to help out,\" Montgomery shouted. \nHe was serving up pulled pork barbecue courtesy of Crawdaddy's Seafood and Catering. The event also included a culinary competition with grillers serving up all kinds of food. In addition to the college football rivalries amongst festival goers, there was also another reason for the occasional trash talking -- food. The tailgate party included a cook-off. \nKim Farley of Kentucky helped out the Kentucky Wild Cats tent. \"I'm hoping our traditional pulled pork barbecue but we'll see. There's a lot of good food here for sure,\" Farley said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T04:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:00:02.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
