THR reports Ron Bass, who wrote the screenplay for the Julia Roberts movie (and won an Oscar for \"Rain Man\"), is working on a follow-up that will be a TV series with half-hour episodes for ABC. The sitcom will pick up where the movie left off and follow Julianne Potter (Roberts) in New York City with her gay friend George (Rupert Everett) after (18-year-old spoiler alert!) her best friend (Dermot Mulroney) choose to stay with his bride (Cameron Diaz). There's no word on who will star -- it won't be Roberts and Everett -- but it's the latest in a slew of remakes, reboots and spinoffs in the works at ABC, including a female-fronted take on \"Fantasy Island.\"\nWhile Lamar Odom is on life support, another man in the Kardashians' world is getting help.

The project plans to \"reinvent\" the franchise by showing McClane as a New York cop in 1979, before he \"became a die hard kind of guy,\" and Willis is expected to appear in scenes recalling his earlier days. And though 2013's \"A Good Day to Die Hard\" underwhelmed at the box office, the five \"Die Hard\" movies have grossed nearly $1.5 billion worldwide altogether so far.\n» Read more at Slash Film .\nAnd Jimmy Fallon mocked the Democratic debate as Donald Trump on \"The Tonight Show\" Wednesday night. The late-night host impersonated the Republican presidential candidate and called Dr. Ben Carson (played by David Alan Grier) to rip the \"hugely boring, huge snoozefest.\" The pair made fun of Lincoln Chafee, the \"crazy old Muppet\" and all the other candidates, including not-too-subtle jabs at Trump and Carson's campaign strategies.\nMore Buzz:\n» Listen: Carrie Underwood, Sam Hunt duet on new song 'Heartbeat' ( Billboard )\n» 'Herbal Viagra' taken by Lamar Odom alarms health regulators ( NY Daily News )\n» 'Hellfire': Marvel, Fox team up for TV series about 1960s mutants ( HitFix )\n» Mark Hamill denies saying 'Carrie!' in 'Star Wars' scene: 'Total BS!'
