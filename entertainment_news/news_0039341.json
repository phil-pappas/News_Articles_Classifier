Bieber's name was not mentioned. \nThe criminal case against Raef has been on hold during the appeals. \nThe ruling on Wednesday noted that by creating a misdemeanor charge for reckless driving in pursuit of images, lawmakers were giving those charged under the statute the right to a jury trial. \nJean-Paul Jassy, a lawyer for several media outlets, argued that the law created penalties for news gathering and \"unconstitutional limits on the press.\" \nHe also urged the justices to look beyond the paparazzi element and not make judgments based on the celebrity news aspect of the case. \n\"One person's paparazzi is another person's mainstream photographer,\" Jassy argued. \nRaef's attorneys, Mark Kressel and Dmitry Gorin, said they were reviewing the ruling and considering their next steps. \nJassy called the ruling disappointing. \n\"The law's only contribution to the vehicle code is to enhance penalties for photography,\" he said. \"Photography is not a crime.\" \nKatharine MacKenzie, an attorney for the city of Los Angeles, which filed the charge against Raef, countered that the law was written to target anyone who was driving recklessly while taking photos, video or audio for commercial purposes. \nShe described a broader group of people who could be charged under the law who aren't celebrity photographers, including artists who snap photos or video while driving recklessly, or documentary filmmakers in pursuit of comment from a reluctant subject. \nMacKenzie argued the law doesn't hamper First Amendment press freedoms. The law only punishes those who \"use a crime to get the image,\" she said. \nThe law was inspired in part by the experience of Jennifer Aniston, who told a lawmaker about being unable to drive away after being surrounded by paparazzi on Pacific Coast Highway. \nThe offense is punishable by six months in jail and a $2,500 fine but went unused until the pursuit of Bieber, which resulted in the singer receiving a speeding citation. \nRaef was also charged with traditional reckless driving charges after the chase that topped 80 mph and prompted several 911 calls. \nAnthony McCartney can be reached at http://twitter.com/mccartneyAP \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:16:42.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
