At the end of the month, each of our judges will name their Top 3 area favorites. \nHere is today's short and sweet review: \nSal's Pizzeria and Grill \nPIZZA PRO 1: One of our sports writers is obsessed with this place, and I can see why. I ordered the supreme, with your usual assembly of meats and veggies and it was good. It has a thin, crispy crust and I really liked the sauce. It also looks like it would be a fun place to watch sports, with plenty of TV and European soccer club banners on the walls. \nGUEST PIZZA PRO: Sal's has great pizza. It's the only (pizza place) around here that actually has New York-style pizza. \nGUEST PIZZA PRO: Sal's Pizzeria and Grill is excellent. Every visit my family has been treated like we are their family. Both owners have always taken the time to talk with us, not just about the food, but about us. \nGUEST PIZZA PRO: Sal's Pizzeria is by far THE BEST pizza in Navarre. The owners treat all of their customers like family. Best authentic Italian food. Food has been consistently good for the 20 years I've been going. \nSal's Pizzeria and Grill , 6903 Navarre Parkway, Navarre.
