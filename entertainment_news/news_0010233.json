Seligman, who was in Albany to present the Finger Lakes Regional Economic Development Council's strategic plan , said he will wait to see who Gov. Andrew Cuomo appoints to a separate-but-similar board, which will help oversee the $600 million Integrated Photonics Institute for Manufacturing Innovation in the Rochester area.\nThe photonics center, however, has been the subject of infighting between some Rochester-area officials and SUNY Polytechnic Institute leaders in Albany. The bickering re-emerged earlier this month, when U of R Vice President for Research Robert Clark was replaced by former Lt. Gov. Robert Duffy as chairman of the AIM Photonics Leadership Council .\nWhen asked about the switch, Seligman said he will wait until Gov. Andrew Cuomo makes his appointments to the similar board, which will also include members appointed by SUNY Poly, U of R and the Rochester Institute of Technology.\n\"We are eagerly awaiting what the governor is going to decide with the AIM Photonics board and we will patiently wait,\" Seligman said.\nHe continued: \"I don't think you've heard the last step in this process, but I don't want to comment further.\"\nSeligman then turned to Wegmans CEO Danny Wegman -- the two are co-chairs of the Finger Lakes regional council -- and asked if he wanted to add anything.\n\"No, you've said even more than I wanted to,\" Wegman said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:05:24.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
