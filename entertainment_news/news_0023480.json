Blood makes him “want to hurl.” He’s got education and a law degree behind him, but they are way behind him, as is his divorce and most of his hopes for having a healthy relationship with a woman he can stand.\nA darkly humorous, swamp-infused murder mystery, “Nothing to Lose” sets Roger amidst a “fraternity of losers, hard luckers and social outcasts,” with a few indications dropped now and then of some other life that existed “before I started (screwing) up.”\nThat other life is the subject of the very different “Hill Country Property.”\nAnchored in the mid 1980’s, but encompassing American cultural developments going back before World War II, the novel serves as Roger’s prequel/backstory, but is much more, standing on its own as a classic Texas family saga.\nStruggling as he sees his marriage to his wife Victoria disintegrating, in this volume Roger digs into stories and remembrances — not to mention Thom McAnn shoe-boxes stuffed with letters and sealed with ancient rubber bands — to uncover the secret history of his extended relations-in-law.\nPart of the novel’s lyrical tone and appeal comes from its three part, time-leaping structure: much of the detective story in this case concerns how the saga is brought to light and becomes told.\nIn addition, unlike “Nothing to Lose,” the dramatic conflicts here are closer to home than narcotics, homicide, or police procedure — and perhaps more satisfying and discomforting for that reason.\nThe characters haven’t gotten crosswise with the law, but with their own experiences and decisions. A young couple faces the specter of abortion. A wife wrestles over whether her marriage has been a mistake. The idealism of the ’60s runs headlong into the practical obstacles of keeping a job and raising a family.\nAlthough masterful with character, this novel is particularly about place — and not just the Hill Country but also “the spaghetti-like maze of San Antonio,” Austin with its “bizarre but interesting people ... the kind you like to watch but not the kind you would want your kids to know,” Houston and more.\nThe geographical stops underscore the rich diversity of Sanderson’s Texas: readers encounter a state that refuses reduction to iconic cowboy postage stamp representation.\nWith “Go Set a Watchman” still in the top 10, it’s difficult to advise whether one should start with the lyrical “Hill Country Property” (the prequel written first) or “Nothing to Lose” (the sequel published first) or ... but, never mind. The novels stand on their own, and if you get a bit of loveable, noble loser Roger Jackson and his story-spinning voice in one volume, you’ll want to go and get more of him in the other.\nClifford Hudder is a Texas writer who teaches at Lone Star Community College.
