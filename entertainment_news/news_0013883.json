(AP) â€” Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh says he has been diagnosed with bladder cancer and is being treated in Arizona. \nThe 75-year-old bassist announced his illness Friday on the Facebook page of his San Rafael restaurant and concert hall, Terrapin Crossroads. \nLesh says he was diagnosed in early October and has been undergoing tests at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale and will eventually have surgery to remove the tumors. He says he's \"very fortunate\" to have the pathology reports show the tumors are all non-aggressive and that there is no indication that they have spread. \nHe canceled Phil Lesh and Friends shows scheduled for Oct. 24 and 25 at the Terrapin Crossroads. \nLesh says he will be able to return to normal activities two weeks after surgery and will reschedule the canceled dates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T01:10:57.551+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
