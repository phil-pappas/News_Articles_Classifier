The network tells Collider , \"Preliminary discussions regarding Watchmen have occurred but we have no additional information and no deals are in place.\" It's still unknown if the proposed series would be a prequel series, a reboot, or a sequel series. The prequel comic series \"Before Watchmen\" centers on eight characters Silk Spectre, Comedian, Nite Owl, Ozymandias, Rorschach, and Dr. Manhattan. It served as background for Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' original 1986 12-issue series. \"Watchmen\", starring Malin Akerman , Billy Crudup , Matthew Goode , Jackie Earle Haley , Jeffrey Dean Morgan , Carla Gugino and Patrick Wilson , grossed over $185 million at the worldwide box office with $130 million budget. While it wasn't a runway hit at box office, many critics felt Snyder did a great job trying to adapt a revered source material which many considered unfilmable. Zack's latest directed movie \" Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice \" is scheduled to hit U.S. theaters on March 25, 2016. He is scheduled to direct two-part \"Justice League\" movie, \" Justice League Part One \" released in 2017 and \" Justice League Part Two \" released in 2019. He will serve as producer in Gal Gadot 's \" Wonder Woman \" and Jason Momoa 's \" Aquaman \" and as executive producer in the highly anticipated \" Suicide Squad \". \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:35:59.432+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
