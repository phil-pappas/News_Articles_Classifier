Mason Noise reminded everyone why you shouldn‚Äôt lock horns with the judges. \nHis nonsensical opening gambit didn‚Äôt get things off to a great start. My name is Mason Noise so make some noise. #XFactor pic.twitter.com/x77HlvRe3v \n‚Äî Ryan Saggers (@RSaggers) October 11, 2015 \nHe then complained about the length of time his performance was given on the previous show, to the great annoyance of Simon.

Mason Noise makes some noise by dropping his mic, while the audience make some noise by booing. #SixChairChallenge https://t.co/8O9agG9QrL \n‚Äî The X Factor (@TheXFactor) October 11, 2015 Ooh I need a cup of camomile tea for all this #Xfactor \n‚Äî Susanna Reid (@susannareid100) October 11, 2015 Mason Noise is the new Ronnie Pickering. #xfactor \n‚Äî Drunk Wolf (@DrunkWolfArt) October 11, 2015 \n7. Nick quickly filled all six of his seats with several performances remaining ‚Äì which showed things can get VERY nervy for those already sitting down. The moment you realise someone's about to lose their seat‚Ä¶ #XFactor pic.twitter.com/fLJKOtMZGv \n8. It‚Äôs not over until it‚Äôs over on this show ‚Äì especially when Nick Grimshaw is in charge. Has Grimmy been too indecisive? (Thames/Syco/Fremantle Media) \nTo the great distress of the studio audience and the general public, Nick gave up Tom Bleasby‚Äôs seat. You are kidding @grimmers No you fool ‚ùé decision #SixChairChallenge @PapasideroDavi üëé \n‚Äî Dont Be Nosey (@DontNosey) October 11, 2015 \nBut, like Lazarus, it appears X Factor contestants can return from the dead ‚Äì after Grimmy responded to the crowd‚Äôs booing and brought Tom back. \nPeople were not altogether impressed with the Radio 1 DJ‚Äôs decision-making. That's why Nick Grimshaw is a hopeless judge on X Factor. Reacts to the crowd, not his gut.I sing better than Nathaniel & I'm terrible. \n‚Äî Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) October 11, 2015 Poor clueless Nick Grimshaw. #XFactor \n‚Äî Steve Brookstein (@stevebrookstein) October 11, 2015 That bring-back was SO spontaneous and unrehearsed. #xfactor \n‚Äî Jill Mansell (@JillMansell) October 11, 2015 \n9.
