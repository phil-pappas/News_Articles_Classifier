While it was nominated for best picture, it was not nominated in the acting and directing categories.\n\"She did a really good job on 'Selma' but 'Selma' deserved an Emmy,\" he said to \"American Psycho\" author.\nThe two then moved on to some of the backlash the director received in 2012 following the release of \"Django Unchained.\" Tarantino was panned by some black writers and filmmakers who believed he diminished the experience of slavery. He felt that these criticisms came from him being a white man.\n\"When the black critics came out with savage think pieces about 'Django,' I couldn't have cared less. If people don't like my movies, they don't like my movies, and if they don't get it, it doesn't matter,\" Tarantino said. \"The bad taste that was left in my mouth had to do with this: It's been a long time since the subject of a writer's skin was mentioned as often as mine. You wouldn't think the color of a writer's skin should have any effect on the words themselves. In a lot of the more ugly pieces, my motives were really brought to bear in the most negative way. It's like I'm some supervillain coming up with this stuff.\"\nReps for DuVernay did not immediately respond to request for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:29:26.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
