A long-time vision of Artistic Director Rebekah Von Rathonyi, the CIB is an off-shoot of the Cornerstone Academy of Performing Arts which Von Rathoni has led since 2012. “Just as an orchestra needs professional musicians, Peoria needs professional dancers to heighten the quality of the performances,” she said. “A professional resident company elevates Peoria to the next level, inevitably increasing the standard of living in the community as a whole. Not only does our community benefit, but our students experience increased mentorship and witness the end result of what their hard work can accomplish.” CIB was formed in January, and consists of a resident company of nine professional dancers, three apprentice/trainees and four regular guest artists. CIB’s goals are to provide professional level ballet at affordable prices and raise awareness for ballet in central Illinois. This is the second year Von Rathonyi has produced “Dracula” for Halloween — last year the Cornerstone Academy of Performing Arts hosted the performance. Malachi Squires, a Chicago-based professional dancer, will return to Peoria to reprise his role as Dracula. Also appearing in Dracula will be members of CIB’s Senior and Junior Company Ensemble, Cornerstone Academy students pursuing a career in professional dance. Audience members are encouraged to wear Halloween costumes. There will be a costume contest with the winner announced at the end of the show. Seating is general admission and tickets will be $18 for adults and $10 for students. Tickets are available at www.cornerstoneballetpeoria.com , www.ciballet.com , and in person at Cornerstone/CIB’s facility at 3117 N. Prospect Road, Peoria.
