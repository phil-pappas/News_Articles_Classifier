Bob Mezan reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript \nOctober 21, 2015 is 'Back to the Future' day - the day when Michael J. Fox's character, Marty McFly, travels from 1989 to 2015 in the film \"Back to the Future Part II,\" and companies are taking advantage of the hype around the day to promote their own lines. Toyota USA has released a commercial featuring Fox and his co-star Christopher Lloyd comparing what future technologies the movie got right; some of the modern advances seen in the movie's version of 2015 included 3D movies, self-tying shoes, and 'hoverboards' - skateboards that levitated above the ground. Ford has also made their own viral commercial, a fake advertisement noting the ability to have 'flux capacitors' installed in their Focus and Fiesta cars; the device is what famously made the film's iconic DeLorean car able to travel through time. A note at the end of the commercial assures viewers that, \"Obviously, this upgrade is not actually available.\" And soda-maker Pepsi unveiled a limited run of 'Pepsi Perfect,' the soda Marty McFly drinks in the film. The cola will be available on October 21, but only 6,500 bottles have been created and they will sell for $20.15 each. The \"Back to the Future\" trilogy made Michael J. Fox, who was already famous for his TV role in \"Family Ties,\" a big screen movie star. All three films combined earned more than 956 million dollars at the global box office.
