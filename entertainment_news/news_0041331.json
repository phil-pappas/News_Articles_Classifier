In a new interview with NME which hits stands Friday, Swift admits that she needs to schedule herself a vacation, or a staycation.\n“I think I should take some time off,” she acknowledges. “People might need a break from me. I’m going to hang out with friends. Write new music. Maybe not write new music. I don’t know.”\nSwift will close her \"1989\" World Tour this December in Australia. During her time off, she will likely be spending quality time with her family, especially her mom, Andrea. The singer reveals that she looks to her mom for frequent advice on her career, especially when she’s feeling anxious and worried about fans missing her.\n“If you let your anxiety get the better of you, like everybody’s waiting for you to really mess up, then you’ll be done,” Swift explains. “A lot of the time I call my mom and talk for a really long time, just to remind myself of all the things that are great and that matter.”\nIn April, Swift went public with the news that her mother has cancer , something the family — and Andrea, who is well-loved by the star’s fans — wanted to share with fans. “She wanted you to know because your parents may be too busy juggling everything they’ve got going on to go to the doctor, and maybe you reminding them to go get checked for cancer could possibly lead to an early diagnosis and an easier battle… Or peace of mind in knowing that they’re healthy and there’s nothing to worry about,” Swift said at the time.\nAccording to Billboard , Swift’s latest album \"1989\" just spent its 49th consecutive week in the Top 10 of the Billboard 200 chart. This fact, and a much needed vacation come December, should help ease her anxiety.\nYou Think You Know Taylor Swift?", "external_links": ["http://www.nme.com/news/taylorswift/88862?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=suffragettes&utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=taylorswift", "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6715445/fetty-wap-debuts-at-no-1-on-billboard-200-albums-chart?utm_source=twitter", "http://tasteofcountry.com/tag/taylor-swift", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/glc5qmStK9s", "http://tasteofcountry.com/taylor-swift-mom-cancer/"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:22:05.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
