We are wowed with the results!\"\nTEL AVIV, Israel , October 15, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --\nCLICK HERE TO SEE VIDEO CASE STUDY\nRADWIN today announced that the City of Temple in Texas , U.S. has implemented the RADWIN 5000 JET Point-to-MultiPoint Beamforming radios to connect city departments and provide high-speed Internet connectivity and IP access traffic. JTS , a leading turnkey solution provider and RADWIN's certified partner, was in charge of project design and implementation.\nBrandon Harris , Assistant Director of IT, City of Temple: \"Prior to RADWIN we were using Point-to-MultiPoint equipment that provided low bandwidth - 2-5 Mbps throughput max - and the connections were intermittent. With RADWIN JET radios we've thoroughly improved network throughput and reliability - we're getting upwards of 10 times more capacity and coverage than ever before!\"\nJim Johnston , CEO, JTS : \"We recommended RADWIN's JET Beamforming radios as the best solution to fulfill the city's requirements from the get-go. The previous systems that the city had been using were dependent on clear line-of-sight, whereas RADWIN's JET radios operate flawlessly even when line-of-sight is obstructed. The JET radios were also extremely simple to install and configure and they overcome the heavy interference in the city's downtown area.\"\nDennis Stipati , General Manager, North America , RADWIN: \"The City of Temple is achieving tangible benefits thanks to RADWIN JET; a rock-stable connection and much faster Internet speeds are enabling the municipality to streamline work processes and enhance efficiency. RADWIN JET encapsulates the industry's leading technologies - from Smart Beamforming antennas to a unique air-interface. This allows JET to operate in the toughest conditions for wireless and deliver incomparable throughput to support bandwidth-demanding applications.\"\nAbout RADWIN\nRADWIN is the leading provider of wireless Point-to-Point, Point-to-MultiPoint and FiberinMotion® solutions.
