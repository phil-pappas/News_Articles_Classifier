We review his new movie, Black Mass, and everything else out this week. Why we didn’t see Davey leave The Bachelorette mansion. Osher Gunsberg explains all. October 9, 2015 9:54am \nThere was no rose ceremony after Sam sent Davey home. Courtesy: Network TEN. October 8th 2015 Spoiler alert ... Osher Gunsberg spills on what happens when The Bachelorette cameras stop rolling. Tiffany Dunk News Corp Australia Network Share Email a friend \nAFTER each episode, we ask The Bachelorette’s host-with-the-most to answer five of our burning questions about the show. \nRead on for Osher Gunsberg’s take on Davey’s lack of limo exit time, the intense group date competition, Sam’s epiphany, Ritchie’s emergence as a frontrunner and what to expect when The Bachelorette returns next week. Flashback ... Osher says the Bachelor girls have it over the Bachelorette guys in the competition stakes. Source: Channel 10 \n1. If you had to compare the go karting date with Nina and Emily on The Bachelor and the carnival date with the boys on The Bachelorette — which got more aggressively competitive? \n“Easily the go karts. Those girls were just full on. The boys did get competitive. There was a lot of boy sport stuff — a bit of pushing, shoving, tackling, sledging. They certainly enjoyed it!” Battle of the Davids ... Davey lost to Dave on the one-on-one time challenge Source: Channel 10 \n2. Sam seemed pretty happy that Dave won that one-on-one time. It must have been a relief for him too? \n“Oh, yeah. But I don’t know if Dave was assertive enough to be honest. He seemed a bit bewildered by what was going on. You’ve just got to go hard. You’ve got to be pulling out the Osher the friendly dragon stories from the gate. Every time you’ve got a chance you’ve got to take it because you never know what’s going on.” Sparks flying ... After their 10 out of 10 date Sam locked lips with Richie Source: Channel 10 \n3. Sam called her date with Richie a 10 out of 10. Was it a good test to see if they can get along? \n“I think it was. It was also a case of, ‘Can you play along.’ Sam obviously enjoys being playful. Could Davey have done that? Probably not. Could Dave have done that? Probably not. I don’t think Sasha could have done that. But Richard was able to be playful. It was a great fit for the two of them and it was great to watch. It was a great idea for a date and Sam went above and beyond putting it together. And who knew Richie could breakdance? And what a kiss! Sam just grabbed his face and went for it.” Thumbs down ... Davey’s antics at the group date saw Sam question if he was the man for her. Source: Channel 10 \n4. Was this the trigger do you think for Sam’s epiphany that Davey could not possibly be the one for her? \n“Let’s just go back a second to the previous episode. Davey fought Tony off, he won and then he said, ‘Can I get a kiss on the cheek’ and he twisted around to get it on the mouth and was like, ‘Ha ha!’. The look on Sam’s face was just, ‘What have I done?’ No Davey, if you just took the kiss on your cheek you might have stayed.” No win situation ... Sam and Davey couldn’t get past her fear he was a ladies man. Source: Channel 10 \n4b. Bonus question please: We didn’t see Davey leaving the mansion. What happened? Was he crying? \n“Look it was very emotional for both of them. It was fairly evident to me that Sam had made up her mind. And everything that needed to be seen to explain exactly what had happened, was seen. You saw exactly the tone that she was taking, you saw exactly Davey’s response. But I will say, telling the guys that Davey was gone was one of the more emotional moments I had. It was really tough. When Sam has been away a long while and then I show up, well they know something’s up. I felt the energy change in the room when the boys knew straight away, ‘Oh, he’s gone.’ It was quite emotional.” Up next ... Osher Gunsberg says that the knives will come out next week. Source: Channel 10 \n5. Tease us up for next week please Osher! \n“The boys cook for Sam. They put it all on the table — insert your puns and double entendres here. If you recall on the first night quite a few of them mentioned that they like to cook. And it’s like MasterChef audition week, it’s on!”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:09:41.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
