I was very happy to see for the first time, a movie which was modern coming out of Bihar... which is true to the language of Bihar and true to the ethics of Bihar. I have lived eight of my very impressionable years in Patna and I was amazed by the simplicity by which such a complicated story is told,\" he added.\nThe film directed by Nitin Neera Chandra is a socio-political drama and stars Kranti, Prakash Jha, Ajay Kumar, Deepak Singh, Arti Puri and Ashish Vidyarthi. It is based on true events, as claimed in the trailer, and highlights the problems the state's residents face with the protagonists raising their voice and fighting against the system.\n\"Bihar is perhaps the most unpopular, supposed to be the most 'ganda' place in India. There is every kind of negativity, especially the politics - the people are weird. But despite all that, why have so many greats taken birth in Bihar. What kind of a ray of hope is there due to which even Gandhiji had gone to Bihar before starting his movement. 'Once Upon A Time In Bihar' has a very relevant look at what Bihar is really about,\" Ali said.\nThe film is releasing on October 30.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:26:02.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
