(HANDOUT) Michael Phillips Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune \"Hitchcock/Truffaut\" is the Chicago Film Fest pick of the day. \nIn 1962, in between \"The Birds\" and \"Marnie,\" Alfred Hitchcock sat down for a series of interviews with his most ardent French fan, the critic and fellow filmmaker Francois Truffaut. For many of us, the book resulting from those talks (\"Hitchcock/Truffaut\") literally fell apart at the binding due to overuse: death by flipped pages. For obsessives as well as Hitchcock agnostics (whoever they are), director Kent Jones' irresistible love letter pays tribute to a great extended conversation exploring technique, life, art and bargains made and sometimes broken with the audience. Jones interviews David Fincher, Martin Scorsese, Wes Anderson and others for a corroborating adoration of the master. \n6 p.m. Monday, AMC River East 21, 322 E. Illinois St. Tickets $11-$14 at chicagofilmfestival .
