The paper says McCartney played the two-hour show at a customer appreciation dinner given by Freightliner Trucks on Sunday.\nMcCartney's wife, Nancy Shevell, is an executive at Elizabeth, New Jersey-based New England Motor Freight, a trucking firm owned by her father.\nMcCartney made other trucking references throughout the show, but his song list was based mostly on his more than 50-year career with the Beatles and solo career.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
