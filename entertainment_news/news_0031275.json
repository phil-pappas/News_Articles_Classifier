A couple make a seemingly impetuous decision to buy/restore/build based on idealism and romance. Can they win the day in the face of apparently insurmountable odds? This is a particularly satisfying version of that story as the ever smiling and even-tempered Jen and Harold get to grips with a crumbling Georgian manor house in Wollongong.   \nHow Safe Are My Drugs, SBS2, 8.30pm  \nAdvertisement Canadian DJ Brianna Price (aka B Traits) takes an extraordinary tour of the British ‘‘legal high’’ scene. Her non-judgmental approach and calm advocacy for harm minimisation makes this an unusually powerful documenary that is also, by turns, terrifying – especially for anyone with teenage kids. Price’s credibility gives her an amazing level of access to users, manufacturers and sellers, painting a chaotic picture of out-of-control risk-taking.  \nRamsay’s Kitchen Nightmares, Seven, 9.40pm  \nRegular Ramsay watchers will be familiar with the show’s tried and tested recipe. Take one failing restaurant, combine with an owner/owners who can’t see the shortcomings of the business and add one celebrity chef, season liberally with foul-mouthed rage and serve garnished with snarky asides from staff eager to stick the knife into management. This episode follows the classic recipe almost to the letter. The subject is Barefoot Bob’s, a casual beachside eatery in Hull, Massachusetts. The business is owned by husband and wife team Mark and Lisa, who each have a very different concept of what it means to run a restaurant. Mark puts in 14-hour days, seven days a week, while Lisa likes to swan around doing as little as possible glued to her phone in a manner familiar to the parents of teenagers everywhere. The mystery ingredient this week is the addition of  Ramsay the Marriage Counsellor. Things aren’t going too well for Mark and Lisa and it’s up to Chef Ramsay to dispense relationship advice as well as his recipe for a killer clam chowder. Ramsay’s couples therapy essentially amounts to telling Lisa to get off her butt and do something around the place. Somewhere, a producer is working on Ramsay’s Marriage Nightmares. \nNick Galvin", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T01:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:47:21.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
