Pic/Santa Banta  \n\"People don't go to the cinema unless it's an event any more. So the movie industry is in a weird place, for sure, and\nthe creative people are blossoming on television,\" Dunst said.\nThe actress said too many films is the reason she shifted to television.\n\"There are just too many movies being made, I think. So many of them get lost. Too many cooks in the kitchen- the studio's editing it, the producers are editing it, the director's editing, too. But everyone has their hand in it, so whose movie is it at the end of the day?\"\nThe 'Interview with the Vampire' actress finds TV more satisfactory as it involves a lot of hard work.\n\"Doing a television show is much, much harder work than film, because you're doing 10 pages a day. You don't get that many takes. And my character does not stop talking,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:34:35.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
