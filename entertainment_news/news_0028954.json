It is effective and easy to use. I am so thrilled to be the first Filipina face of Proactiv and tell everyone all about my experience using it,” the 27-year- old TV host shares. “Its mild formulation gently exfoliates my skin, removes excess oil and delivers powerful acne-fighting medicine.” Alex Gonzaga is Proactiv's first Filipina endorser \nBeing an in-demand celebrity causes stress and fatigue, which may take a toll on the skin. The long hours of tapings and shoots, the never-ending mall shows and pounds of make-up cause damage on the skin such as zits and breakouts. She knows, however, that with Proactiv’s dermatologically tested ingredients, her skin stays clear, radiant and acne-free. \nEven with her frenetic schedule, Alex finds time to adhere to Proactiv’s simple and easy 3-Step System. \n“As my beauty regimen before going to sleep, I apply Proactiv’s Step 1 which is the Renewing Cleanser. You can feel it gently removing impurities in your skin with its exfoliating beads,” Alex explains. \nThe Renewing Cleanser is an oil-free, soap-free medicated exfoliating cleanser that kills acne-causing bacteria with U.S. prescription-grade benzoyl peroxide. The ultra-fine micro-crystal benzoyl peroxide penetrates pores fast while being gentle on the skin. \n“I follow it up with Step 2 which is the Revitalizing Toner,” Alex continues. Proactiv’s Revitalizing Toner is refreshing alcohol-free toner that refines and purifies pores. Its Glycolic acid exfoliates dead skin cells to help keep pores unplugged while its botanical-rich formula soothes and hydrates acne-prone skin. \n“Step 3 is the Repairing Treatment. I just squeeze a pea-sized amount on my palm and spread it on my face,” she adds. \nThe Repairing Treatment is a feather-light, invisible medicated treatment that kills acne-causing bacteria preventing zits and acne. \nEach Proactiv kit comes with a free Refining Mask. This Refining Mask makes a great leave-on spot treatment at night for better complexion in the morning. \n“We are proud to have Alex Gonzaga as the first Filipina face of Proactiv. She is beautiful, spontaneous and hip, making her a perfect fit for the brand,” says Proactiv Philippines General Manager, Mari del Rosario. “With Alex heading our local campaign, we hope to reach out to more Filipinos and Filipinas and encourage them to take a step and fight acne today.” \nProactiv is available in 30-day kit (P 2,495.00) and 60-day kit (P 3,995.00) and is exclusively distributed at all Watsons nationwide.
