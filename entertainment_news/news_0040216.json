(Photo by Joel Ryan/Invision/AP, File)   BERLIN â€” \nMeryl Streep has been chosen to head the jury at the Berlin International Film Festival in February. \nOrganizers said Wednesday it will be the first time in her career that the Oscar-winning 66-year-old actress has served on a film festival jury. \nStreep said in a statement released by the festival: \"The responsibility is somewhat daunting, as I have never been president of anything before.\" She added that she is \"grateful for the honor.\" \nThe Berlin festival honored Streep for her lifetime achievement in 2012. \nThe 2016 event, the first of the year's major European film festivals, runs Feb. 11-21. The seven-member jury at this year's event was led by American director Darren Aronofsky. \nThere was no immediate word on who will serve alongside Streep on the 2016 jury.
