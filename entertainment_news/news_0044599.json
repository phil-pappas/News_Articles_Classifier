Because no major entertainment outlet has truly dedicated a reporter to the beat, it was not an easy feat,\" said Josh Dickey, Entertainment Editor at Mashable. \"Saba however has the right mix of knowledge, passion for the subject and old-soul journalism chops to tackle the most exciting story in entertainment since the dawn of the internet.”\nSaba will join Mashable’s rapidly growing Los Angeles office, which opened this summer and is filling up fast, at the end of the month.\nBefore joining Mashable, Hamedy spent two years at the Los Angeles Times covering all things entertainment for the Calendar and Company Town sections. But all the while, she was carving out her own beat, covering the stars of YouTube, Vine, Instagram, Snapchat and other emerging platforms of her own enterprise.\n\"Saba was basically creating herself in the image that I had for this position from the start,\" Dickey said. \"It was a brilliantly prescient thing for a young journalist to do -- and now she'll be doing it for Mashable.\"\nPrior to the Los Angeles Times, Hamedy worked on the business desk at the Arizona Republic, where she was part of the Pulitzer Prize-nominated team that covered the Yarnell Hill Fire in 2013. Hamedy grew up in Santa Monica -- the wellspring of the Silicon Beach phenomenon, which she will also be covering -- and graduated from Boston University.\nWhen she's not reporting, she's binge-watching shows online or looking for new coffee shops to frequent. She can be found on Twitter at @saba_h.\nAbout Mashable:\nMashable is the leading global media company that informs, inspires and entertains the digital generation. Mashable is redefining storytelling by documenting and shaping the digital revolution in a new voice, new formats and cutting-edge technologies to a uniquely dedicated audience of 45 million monthly unique visitors and 25 million social followers.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13012092.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13012092.htm"], "published": "2015-10-08T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:43:42.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
