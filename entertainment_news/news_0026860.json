As you probably know by now, Greg Hardy served a four-game suspension for a domestic violence incident in which he allegedly assaulted his ex-girlfriend, threatened to kill her and then threw her onto a futon full of loaded firearms. \nEarlier this week, Hardy told reporters he hopes he comes out \"guns blazing\" and even made comments about Tom Brady's wife. What's even more alarming, NFL Commissioner Roger Gooddell said he was unaware of Hardy's controversial comments 24 hours later. \nThings got worse Wednesday when Cowboys owner Jerry Jones basically agreed with Greg Hardy by saying Tom Brady went up in his eyes 100 percent after marrying Giselle. Friday, Jones doubled down during a Dallas radio interview by blaming the media. \nSo Greg Hardy has shown no remorse for his actions, Roger Goodell claims ignorance, Jerry Jones blames the media, and no one is blaming the NFL. But should we be? Should the NFL be held accountable? \nWe took that question to CNN sports anchor Rachel Nichols. Here's what she had to say: \n\"Let me ask you this,\" said Morgan Fogarty. \"If we're not really seeing any sort of divisive, or definitive action I should say, from Roger Goodell or from Jerry Jones, or really, even the Dallas head coach danced around it when he responded to it finally, do we look to the other players? Do we look to Tom Brady to say you know what, not okay dude?\" \"Look you know what, I would have loved to seen that from Tom Brady. He sort of danced around the question too. And that's what i was looking for from Roger Goodell as well. To say 'not okay'. Because here's the thing: I love football! I love football. I've spent my whole life covering football. Stop poisoning the well. Stop poisoning football for the rest of us reasonable people. We want our sport to be free from all this stuff. And just because a bunch of guys wear pink cleats for one month out of the year, does not mean you care about. You need to show people you care about women. You need to highlight the players that are doing things. And you need to make sure the guys who aren't, are corrected. Not just let it go.\" \nAnd that brings us to our Question of the Night: Does the NFL care about women?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T16:51:08.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
