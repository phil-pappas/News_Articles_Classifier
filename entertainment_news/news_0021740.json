The parade started by the Inn at Harvard and ended at the steps of the magazine’s headquarters, Lampoon Castle, where he was presented with a trophy and an 85-cent check. \nIt’s just the seventh time the undergraduate organization says it has bestowed the honor. Previous recipients include Jay Leno, John Cleese and Robin Williams. \nThe 41-year-old Fallon took over The Tonight Show from Leno last year. \nRELATED STORIES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T06:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:39:48.998+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
