Investigators believe Kaneesha Williams, 23, was driving south when she lost control of her Ford Explorer, Baker said. The SUV swerved several times before overturning into the tree line on the right side of the road. Williams’ passenger, Alexis Johnson, 19, was ejected from the vehicle as it flipped. Johnson’s injuries were fatal. Williams was transported to Memorial University Medical Center with non-life-threatening injuries.\nFriday, at about 9:45 p.m. Savannah-Chatham police responded to eastbound Interstate 516 at Mildred Street, where Real Nu, 57, of New York, was struck by a Ford Explorer, driven by Terry Morris, 62, of Savannah, Baker said. Nu was traveling north on I-516 when he inadvertently walked into the path of Morris’s eastbound SUV. Nu sustained serious, but non-life-threatening injuries. He was transported to MUMC for treatment, Baker said.\nBoth cases remain under review by MAIT.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-25T11:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:23:15.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
