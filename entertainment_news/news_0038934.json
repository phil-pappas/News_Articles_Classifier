I’m never bored. “There’s interesting stuff going on every night,” is what I was telling one of the out-of-town cast members of the Geva Theatre Center play Red , opening next week. “You just have to know where to look.” And I pointed out a couple of good restaurants and music venues just a few minutes’ walk from where we were sitting. Places, I told him, that would make him feel like he was home in New York City. Except the rats are much, much larger in New York City.\nLast Saturday was a perfect example. I mean of our cultural riches, not rats. I really wanted to see the worldly string magic of David Bromberg at the German House Theater . I really wanted to hear the cynical wisdom of Robbie Fulks at Abilene Bar & Lounge. I’m always comfortable with Connie Deming — best voice in Rochester — at The Little Café.\nI chose Joywave at Anthology . A good move, as it turned out. Homecoming gig by a Rochester band that’s been touring for six months, now being sized up by the indie-rock world as perhaps the next Coldplay. The club was packed, maybe 1,000 people. The owners knocked down some partitions to make the East Avenue club almost as big as Water Street Music Hall, currently going through one of its rudderless periods where it’s booking nothing of note. So Anthology is poised to step in as a major player in town, with Yonder Mountain String Band, Mastodon and Fun’s Nate Ruess set for the first three weeks of November.\nAnd Joywave? It seems to have the right stuff. Good songs you can dance to, a unique-looking frontman who connects with the crowd, energy and a positive vibe. And smart: Yes, that was a shard of Neil Young’s “Don’t Let it Bring You Down” they slipped in on this twentysomething gathering. Could happen, could happen …\nBut now it’s a new week, and I’m weighing the calendar again. It’s heavy. The Red Elvises are returning to Sticky Lips BBQ Juke Joint in Henrietta. A clever retro-rock band, both real and mythological. Since it began playing in 1995 the lineup of Russian-raised rockers has dwindled until only frontman Igor Yzov remains. It seems like a joke now running on fumes, but when the band played Sticky Lips earlier this year it drew a big crowd and had the place jumping. Just a great night, fun music, the surf and garage rock augmented with Russian folk rhythms, and this latest version of the Red Elvises made up largely of an all-women punk band with a ton of personality.\nOn the subject of personality, the Raw Magillys certainly had that when it was a top local club act in the 1990s. A hillbilly take on roots, reggae and general Americana, fronted by Heidi and Hildi Magilly, roll-in-the-hay cowgirls in overalls, armed with guitars, banjos and accordions. Sometimes they’d bake cookies for the audience. But good things do end. Hildi left town. Heidi was revealed as April Laragy, re-inventing herself as the space goddess of The Atomic Swindlers, which briefly became the darling of the lesbian music-video audience.\nNow the Raw Magillys are back, with three-fourths of the lineup intact — drummer Roy Stein and new bassist Alex Goettel – and a comeback show Saturday at Lovin’ Cup Bistro & Brews. In Henrietta. What, is Henrietta the new rock capital of Monroe County? A welcome revival, this was roots music before everyone started growing long beards. Except Laragy.\nThis week also marks the return of Rochester’s Greg Townson, the longtime Hi-Risers frontman celebrating the release of his second solo album, My Friend the Night , with a 6 p.m. Friday Happy Hour show at Abilene Bar & Lounge.\nThis is great news, and not because no one dies in a Townson song. He writes with Buddy Holly clarity and plays guitar like he hasn’t left the garage since 1957, even though Townson’s been around the world as a solo act and with Los Straitjackets, although you wouldn’t know it was Townson because they’re all wearing Mexican wrestling masks. That Los Straitjackets gig, and drummer Jason Smay signing on with fast-rising roots rocker JD McPherson, has put the brakes on the Hi-Risers, one of Rochester’s best rock bands.\nOn My Friend the Night , Townson is restrained, comfortable. His gentle vocals accompany some of his usual reliable co-writers: Hi-Risers bassist Todd Bradley, John DeAngelis and Allyson Bice. He offers instructions on how to make popcorn — “Shake, shake, shake!” — and acknowledges mortality with the Satchel Paige-like observation of, “You can’t stop time when it’s your time to go.”\nTownson’s songs are often ignited by a spark of new romance. “Just A Little Bit More.” Love is “One Person,” and heals a cynic who says, “I roll my eyes at the perfect couple” and then melts at the “Oldest Trick in the Book.” Townson’s biggest musical departure is “These Shoes of Mine,” just acoustic guitar and footsteps. The only song he didn’t write or co-write is an upbeat two-beat ska guitar instrumental of Vince Guaraldi’s “Linus & Lucy” that evolves into a Ventures-like tremolo solo.\nTownson’s “Bird Watchin’,” which in the ’60s would have been a garage band’s sly salute to ogling women, apparently it really is about bird watching. A short list of birds at the end of the song wraps up with “Surfin’ Bird,” a reference to one of the most-glorious garage songs ever by The Trashmen.\nHe rarely gets cranky. Just “North American Town,” with its line about, “I was hanging out in Las Vegas, Nevada, a place I truly cannot stand.” But he redeems with the gem of a line a few seconds later, “I’ve even got brand new shoes for this old soul.”\nOh, but one other thing he truly cannot stand is “The Opinion Page,” where he sings what he reads, “The mayor we elected is a fool, everyone is outta work.” But really, why blame newspapers, it’s about the decline of Western Civilization in general. “What happened to cooking a meal, fast food is nothing but junk. There hasn’t been decent music since Thelonious Monk.”\nHe’s wrong, at least about that last part. My Friend the Night says so.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:10:21.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
