It’s been life changing for us. The Universe is so funny and ROCKS. What a sense of humor and timing it has.\nI had been asking the Universe about my skin and attracting more money. I turned 50 in September and had never taken care of my skin and didn’t know how to (not a girlie girl). I had been relying on my good genes. My Mama (maternal grandmother) had kick a** skin. But she took care of it. Not me. I am lazy about that stuff because it (used to) bore me. Lemme put it to you this way, one of my students told me six years ago that it’s best to not wash your face at night so your body replenishes the oils naturally. I took it a step further (who me?) and didn’t wash my face for TWO YEARS after I had my twins. Morning or night. I’ll leave it at that - you get the picture.\nThe money stuff — eh, that’s private, but let’s just say that yoga has become the new black dress and hellow, a corporate yoga chain opened across the street from our very first yoga studio. Ya, whatever. Keep calm and let Karma finish it. That’s what we been doin’ but hey, ya gotta pay the bills (and all of the teachers and the rent x 5).\nSo . . . while on ACK last July it kept coming to me, “I need to get back to the mainland and teach at Prana Winchester.” It came to me every single day, again and again.\nThen we got back on July 31st and I was slated to teach at Prana Winchester on Saturday morning August 1st. But alas, a Prana teacher was moving and couldn’t get a sub for her class at Prana Newton so I taught for her in Newton instead of Winchester. My Spirit was not happy — it was like, “Winchester! Winchester!”\nThe following week, Saturday August 8th, I taught in Winchester. I noticed a student come in a bit late. Just noticed her. I also noticed her on her mat because she was doing scorpion while I was teaching something else. Just noticed. (I love when people modify -- so no irritation there).\nAt the end of class students lined up to talk to me and she was in line - last in line. We talked for a bit, and then my life changed . . . forever. Hurray! I smiled as I understood my Spirit’s insistent and relentless push for me to teach in Winchester.\nThe student (Jess) said, “Taylor, you are so magnetic, I don’t know why I never thought of you for this business . . . .” to which I replied, “I’ve been waiting for you.\"\nThen she told me about Rodan & Fields.\nTen to twenty people approach me a day about new companies, new things, new books, new products, new food bars, new whatevers — ask me to advertise, write about them, buy a product, promote a product, and so on. I’ve been around the block. For many years. I always respond respectfully to people (in my humble opinion, in this day and age when it takes two secs to respond, it’s the kind and respectful thing to do), but the answer is usually, “No, thank you. I only support and promote what I LOVE LOVE LOVE and believe in. (And then you can’t shut me up.)\"\nRodan & Fields is our new venture.\nWe love this company and its structure for a lot of reasons. If it sounds fun, email me here: taylor@pranapoweryoga.com and I’ll tell you more either online, live, or on the phone (which I have never liked talking on and so for a few years refused to do so -- until now. Now I’m loving it.)\nWe are building a fantastic team (law of attraction) and would love you to be part of it if it sounds fun and if you feel you would CRUSH it, love it, have fun, help a lot of people, and make a lot of money — as everyone on the team does. It’s not competitive in any way -- is all about working together. Love it!\nIf it don’t sound fun to be on our team but you’re curious about the products, email me. This sh** sells itself. I don’t have to say a word. I'm totally confident you will love it like I do. If you don’t, they have an empty bottle refund policy. That’s pretty amazing. You can use it all then say, “Nah, don’t like it, refund my money.” Shows how much they believe in what they do. Very yogic.\nAnd thank you Universe, I now have the best skin care regime ever and it’s easy peasy and affordable and my skin looks better every day — with no work or time. Which is good because I have no patience for that. In fact, I actually love my little skin care time in the morning and night. It’s fun and makes me happy. And remember, it’s all about fun and happiness. The rest is just filler.\nBe the Inspiration.\nNamaste!\nTaylor plus 5", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T12:40:18.496+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
