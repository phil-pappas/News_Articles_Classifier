Some orchestras had them, some didn’t, and the particular sound that a pair of clarinets could add to an orchestral texture inspired the composer in many ways. The other source of Mozart’s longtime love for the instrument was the virtuosity of his friend Anton Stadler , for whom he wrote both the Clarinet Concerto and the exquisite Quintet for Clarinet and Strings.\nThat quintet is the centerpiece of a program featuring the Dalí Quartet and clarinetist Ricardo Morales , all artists visiting from Philadelphia. The rest of the program boasts a largely Latino theme, with chamber works by Joaquín Turina , Efraín Amaya , Carlos Gardel , Abelardito Valdes and Paquito D’Rivera.\n— Joshua Kosman \nDalí Quartet with Ricardo Morales: 7 p.m. Sunday, Oct. 25. $37-$49. Trianon Theatre , 72 N. Fifth St., San Jose.
