There were 4,020 sales of existing single-family homes for the quarter, up from 3,708 during the same period last year. Sales were particularly strong in the northern part of Monroe County, with Webster, Irondequoit, Parma and Hamlin showing gains of 15 to 24 percent in closings over last year.\nThe increase in home sales comes while inventory is low. Homes on the market were down 8.3 percent from the third quarter of 2014, but the number of new listings coming on the market recently is on the rise, said Toni Connors, president-elect of Greater Rochester Association of Realtors.\nThe quarter was especially active during the summer months because buyers wanted to take advantage of lower mortgage rates still available before the looming increase, which is anticipated before the year’s end, said GRAR President Andy Burke. Mortgage interest rates have been hovering around the 4 percent range for 30-year loans, said Pat Cusato of Mortgage Bankers Association of Genesee Region.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nSelling a home in the fall market\nTypically, spring is the busiest season in Rochester real estate but that’s changing.\n“We have seen a trend toward a longer selling season over the last several years, and this is another sign that trend is continuing,” Burke said.\nThe market continues to be hot in late fall, said Craig Schneider, broker at NORCHAR Realty in Brighton. Many buyers are still in the market shopping for homes, he said.\nRanch-style homes and multi-family homes are what’s trending in new builds, said Rick Herman, CEO of Rochester Home Builders’ Association. For the first three quarters of 2015, there were 499 multi-family new build permits compared to 290 during the first three quarters of 2014, he said. There were 650 single-family permits during the first three quarters compared to 637 during the same period.\n“The market is very strong throughout our industry,” Herman said. “Whether consumers are looking for an entry-level home, moving up or downsizing.”\nAcross the state, home sales are also improving. The New York housing market closed its third quarter this year with a 9.1 percent increase in sales compared to the third quarter of 2014, according to the state Association of Realtors. The statewide median sales price also increased, up 4.3 percent in the 2015 third quarter, with median statewide year-to-date sales price at $232,000, which is a 3.1 percent gain from last year.\nIn the Greater Rochester region, median sales prices rose 6.7 percent to $136,000, according to the local Realtors’ group.\nMCHAO@Gannett.com\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nSelling a home in the fall market", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cfd01b4e1a3faa73a4834598cb2c5678a44daaae/c=204-0-1428-1224/local/-/media/2015/09/09/Rochester/Rochester/635774122275235976-hrefall.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-23T02:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:03:20.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
