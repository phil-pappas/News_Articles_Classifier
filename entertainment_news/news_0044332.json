Comment By (For) The Ionia Sentinel-Standard Ionia Sentinel - Standard-Ionia, MI By (For) The Ionia Sentinel-Standard Posted Oct. 5, 2015 at 11:58 PM Updated at 11:58 PM By (For) The Ionia Sentinel-Standard Posted Oct. 5, 2015 at 11:58 PM IONIA, Mich. Michigan author Randy Rassoul is the guest speaker at a special program sponsored jointly by the Ionia County Historical Society and the Ionia Community Library. The event, which is open to the public, takes place Wednesday, Oct. 7 at 7 p.m. at the John C. Blanchard House, the restored Victorian mansion that serves as headquarters of the historical society. There is no admission charge. Combined with beautiful color photos, the presentation — entitled “Cottages, Castles, Forts, and Follies”— features highlights of Rassoul’s innovative travel guide “I Slept in a Pineapple.” The book showcases a collection of endangered buildings in the United Kingdom and Ireland that have been meticulously restored and offered as stunning one-of-a-kind vacation rentals. Rassoul introduces a collection of fascinating historic rentals that are largely unknown to travelers on this side of the Atlantic. They are a well-kept secret—an exciting option to traditional hotel-based travel. “I Slept in a Pineapple” reveals how to find and book remarkable properties, hidden gems just waiting to be discovered. Choose from a treasury of idyllic thatched cottages, fairy-tale castles, imposing manors, medieval half-timbered townhouses, coastal forts, lighthouse keepers’ quarters, mysterious towers, baronial estates, gatehouses and eccentric follies. An example is the iconic Pineapple on the cover of the book. Built in the 18th century for the 4th Earl of Dunmore in Scotland, it is an elaborate summer house with a whimsical dome shaped like a giant pineapple, complete with prickly leaves of stone. It sleeps four in two bedrooms and features an elegant sitting room with romantic wood-burning fireplace. “I Slept in a Pineapple” received national recognition as a finalist in the 2015 National Indie Excellence Awards which celebrates the best of books in print. The national award program, based in Los Angeles, is open to all English language books from small, medium, and independent and university presses.

Rassoul, who lives with her husband near Marion in a cabin on the high banks of the Middle Branch River, is a former professor of French language and literature. She lived and studied in Paris and travels extensively throughout Europe. For a number of years, she operated MétaVoyage, a European travel and vacation rental agency. The John C. Blanchard House is located at 251 E.
