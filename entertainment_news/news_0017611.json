She has just lost her job as an assistant principal at Long Island's Southampton High School after being spotted in the clip for the R&B singer's collaboration with rapper JR, \"Best Friend\". In the video, she plays a woman who's going on a vacation with her husband and asks JR to take care of her house when she's not around. After she and her on-screen husband left, the rapper throws a house party with Trey and a bunch of bikini-clad ladies. The school she worked at wasn't pleased after learning of Adler-O'Keefe's cameo in the expletive-and-twerk-filled clip. \"It has recently come to our attention that a member of our administrative staff appeared in a music video. The video in question showcases behaviors and language use that is not promoted by the Southampton School District,\" Superintendent of Schools Dr. Scott Farina said in an email to parents as quoted by Newsday. \"In fact, we actively teach our students the importance of good character and making smart choices. Additionally, this is not representative of who we are as a district nor of our students and staff,\" she added. Defending herself, Adler-O'Keefe said that she was \"unaware\" what the video would be about when she agreed to appear in it last summer. \"Speaking as a private individual and not in my professional capacity, I wish to state for the record that, when I agreed to participate, I was completely unaware of the content, lyrics and title of the video and song,\" she explained. \"Had I known of such content or lyrics, I certainly would not have participated in any fashion. I find the lyrics and content of the music video vulgar, offensive and demeaning.\" Adler-O'Keefe's not completely fired, though. Farina additionally announced that the former assistant principal had been reassigned to a new position that involves overseeing academic support services throughout the school district. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T05:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:21:42.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
