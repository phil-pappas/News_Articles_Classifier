Volunteers (aged 14 or older) have been carving the pumpkins since last Saturday. The nature center provides all the pumpkins, tools and stencils. \nVisitors with advance tickets will also enjoy face-painting, fortune telling, autumn treats and family-friendly ghost stories. \nRobin O'Gallo of Onondaga County Parks said people cannot pay more at the door to get in to Enchanted Beaver Lake. If people show up without their advance tickets, they will be turned away. \nFor more information, call the Nature Center at 638-2519 or visit OnondagaCountyParks.com . \nFor those with advance tickets: Where: Beaver Lake Nature Center at 8477 East Mud Lake Rd.
