Moore told People magazine she tried in vain to keep the news away from her then 12-year-old daughter. \n“I was like, ‘I’ve had it.’ I said to my husband, ‘I’ve got to do something. This is the one thing that I need to say something about. This is my responsibility as a parent'” she told the magazine. \nMoore, who won an Oscar in February for her role as a woman with early onset Alzheimer’s disease in “Still Alice,” said she went through her address book to garner support. “The response has been overwhelming. I’m so, so thrilled. Everybody feels this way about this issue,” Moore told People. \nU.S. President Barack Obama made a concerted push for broad gun control reforms after the Connecticut shootings but was unsuccessful. He called again for new measures after the Oregon shootings but was met with protests by gun rights supporters when visiting there to console families last week. \n(Reporting By Jill Serjeant ; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:01:51.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
