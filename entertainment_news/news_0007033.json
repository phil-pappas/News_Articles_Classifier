On Sunday, Lucasfilm unveiled the theatrical poster for \"The Force Awakens\" as part of the countdown to the trailer and ticket release. Despite initial plans for the tickets to go on sale following the trailer's debut, online ticketers put them on sale almost two hours before halftime, straining many sites, including Fandango and MovieTickets.com, with many users reporting site crashes and error messages as fans rushed to secure their seats. \nLucasfilm's promotional strategy for the hotly anticipated film has been meticulous, beginning with a coordinated launch of the first teaser which debuted in 30 theaters and online in November, followed by a longer teaser trailer that premiered during Star Wars Celebration in April. Other footage, including TV spots, a behind-the-scenes making-of reel and a special Instagram scene have been parceled out over recent months, along with a massive toy launch, but the latest release is believed to be the final theatrical trailer, which is expected to be attached to the latest James Bond installment, \"Spectre,\" upon its Nov. 6 release. \nDirected by J.J. Abrams, \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" stars Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Lupita Nyong'o, Andy Serkis, Domhnall Gleeson, Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew and Max Von Sydow. Abrams, Kathleen Kennedy and Bryan Burk are producing with Tommy Harper and Jason McGatlin serving as executive producers. The screenplay was written by Lawrence Kasdan & Abrams and Michael Arndt. \nRian Johnson is directing \"Star Wars: Episode VIII,\" which is scheduled for for release on May 26, 2017. Colin Trevorrow's \"Episode IX\" is slated for a 2019 release, while a standalone Han Solo origin film, directed by \"21 Jump Street\" helmers Phil Lord and Chris Miller, will bow in theaters on May 25, 2018. The first standalone film in the franchise, \"Star Wars: Rogue One,\" will debut on December 16, 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T05:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:44:02.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
