When her long-lost daughter, Tilly (Kate Winslet), returns to town. bent on taking revenge for past wrongs, Molly's life begins again. The Dressmaker , directed by Jocelyn Moorhouse and based on the novel by Rosalie Ham, is set in 1951, and it's a dark, entertaining story of secrets, lies and the transformative power of a woman and her sewing machine.\nJudy Davis in The Dressmaker \nThe rediscovered relationship between mother and daughter is at the heart of the film. \"It was a very strong script and it worked very well on the page,\" Davis says. \"But there's always a journey you go on as an actor, and it changes and shifts. The challenge for me – and I think for the film generally – was to tread that fine line between the slightly off-the-wall comedy, and the true pathos that's in the story. I had to somehow make both believable.\" A straightforward scene, she says, was one of the trickiest for her. It happens right at the beginning, when Tilly turns up on her mother's doorstep. \"She calls me mum, and I say, what are you talking about, I don't have a daughter.\" She and Winslet both found that moment \"quite hard\", she says. \"It's a very delicate scene.\"\nAdvertisement Thinking about that denial, she says, she asked herself about Molly's state of mind. \"And I couldn't really answer that. She's had a shocking trauma, she's been alone for years, she's got a drinking problem, some kind of mini-stroke that has affected her movement.\n\"My mother had dementia, and I probably did use a bit of that,\" she says, \"that moment where you confront somebody who doesn't remember and it's a frightening thing.\" For other aspects of Molly's character – her emerging energy, the pleasure she takes in saying and doing whatever she wants – she had to ask herself different questions. She had to think about comic timing and letting go.\nKate Winslet and Judy Davis in The Dressmaker. \n\"You've got to be brave,\" she says, \"and I learned that from Woody Allen\", with whom she has made five features. He told her, she says, that you can't go too far. \"I think what he meant was that you have to go further than you might imagine to push something into comedy.\" She remembers a scene she did for him in which she had to hail a cab. The character was in distress and in a rush, she says, \"and I was about to get in to the taxi when he said, can can you maybe drop your bag.\" She did it again, she dropped her bag, things fell out, she crammed them back in, worrying that she was taking too long. He asked her to do it again, and told her this time to just throw the things she had dropped into the back seat. \"I looked at him and thought, why didn't I think of that? It was really funny, this woman hurling all these personal items into the back of the taxi.\"\nShe might have learned from Allen, but she never found him easy to talk to, something she says that irritated her on the set of To Rome With Love , the last film she made with him. \"You can blurt out deep stupidities out of desperation,\" she says, remembering how she asked him, \"Have you ever written an epic, and what's your feeling about the problems they present?\" She sighs at the memory. \"What was I thinking? That's what nerves will do to you.\" It's a question that preoccupies her still. She had epics on her mind, as it happens, because of a screenplay she is working on, a work that is an epic and a period piece. \"I have a draft but it's not quite there. I've picked something quite hard, and I've been wrestling with it for several years.\" It's an adaptation of an Australian book, and it's not a Patrick White novel. She loves his work, she says. \"Regardless of the novel, there'll always be at the very least one passage of his writing that reduces me to tears.\" For a while she had the rights to White's The Aunt's Story , \"but I didn't know how to do it, it was too hard.\"\nShe met White, she says, \"after a play I did with Kate Fitzpatrick, whom he loved, and all I said was, 'I like your books', and he said, 'I like your singing.' And we used to run into him in Centennial Park, when he'd walk his dogs. I was utterly in awe of him, it was a missed opportunity. I should have said, 'We should have some coffee,' but it's not my way.\"\nWoody Allen and Judy Davis on the set of To Rome with Love. Photo: Gabriel Wilder \nAt this point, there are no acting roles ahead of her. \"I love directing and I'm enthralled by the challenges of writing.\" She has directed three productions for the Sydney Theatre Company, and is directing a play next year at Belvoir Street, Brian Friel's  Faith Healer , with her husband, Colin Friels. She made the choice to direct rather than perform, she says. \"Frankly, in the theatre I prefer that, it's really wonderful directing actors in a good play, I've felt so privileged doing it.\"\nThe Dressmaker opens on October 29", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T09:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:27:02.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
