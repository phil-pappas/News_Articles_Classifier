It was awful, but it also showed me how much love and support I have in this world,\" the comic said in his opening monologue.\n\"People are wondering, 'Can he speak? Does he have 100 percent mental capacity?'\" he asked. \"The truth is, I never did. I might even be a few points higher.\"\nIn one sketch, he was joined by \"30 Rock\" co-stars Tina Fey, Alec Baldwin, Jane Krakowski and Jack McBrayer. Fey broke character to inject a serious note: \"We're so happy you're OK. We're even happier you're ready to make people laugh again.\"\nMorgan also brought back a couple of his familiar characters - Astronaut Jones (stranded on Mars, a la Matt Damon in \"The Martian\") and animal expert Brian Fellow (joined by a real camel, who mostly cooperated).\nMorgan suffered severe head trauma in June 2014 when a truck on the New Jersey Turnpike slammed into the back of the limo van he was riding in. Comedian James \"Jimmy Mack\" McNair, a mentor of Morgan's, was killed in the crash. Morgan suffered head trauma and was in a coma for two weeks. Three other passengers suffered serious injuries.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
