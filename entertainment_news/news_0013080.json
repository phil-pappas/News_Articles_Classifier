Remarkable. Dammit- if PR2 happens, that girl is getting a Jaeger.\nâ€” Guillermo del Toro (@RealGDT) October 3, 2015 There's still some sliver of hope for Pacific Rim 2, though. Although it was pulled from the Universal release schedule to help with rewrites and so on, Del Toro has stated emphatically that he's still working on it as an active project.\nHe's still in regular contact with castmembers such as Charlie Hunnam and Idris Elba, so that's all positive and if he's lining up new castmembers for it, it's definitely on his to-do list.\nA lot of Pacific Rim 2's fortune would swing on how Crimson Peak performs at the box-office. If it does the business for Universal, they'll be more likely to let him do Pacific Rim 2 than if it doesn't.\nIn the meantime, let's all come up with names for Maisie Williams' Jaeger robot because the names they had in the first one were SO COOL.\nVia Twitter\nMORE: Pacific Rim 2 pulled from release schedule, effectively cancelling the Apocalypse\nMORE: Daniel Craig says he's NOT done with James Bond just yet\nMORE: Robert DeNiro reteaming with Joe Pesci, Al Pacino & Martin Scorsese for I Heard You Paint Houses", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/RealGDT/status/650266337370112001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/RealGDT/status/650266337370112001"], "published": "2015-10-07T19:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:27:30.078+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
