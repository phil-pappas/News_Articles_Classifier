Contemporary leading Wagnerian tenor Johan Botha takes on the daunting title role opposite soprano Eva-Maria Westbroek as Elisabeth, adding another Wagner heroine to her Met repertoire after her acclaimed Sieglinde in the Ring a few seasons ago. On the heels of his recent triumph in “Parsifal,” baritone Peter Mattei sings Wolfram; and mezzo-soprano Michelle DeYoung is the love goddess, Venus. \n“Tannhäuser” is sung in German, with English subtitles, and runs about four hours and 20 minutes. Tickets are $27, $15 for those younger than 19 and college students with ID (call the box office to purchase tickets at the student price, 594-0070, ext. 3). Encore show tickets are available day-of-show for $23 and $5. Season ticket packages also are available. \nFor more information about all upcoming live concerts, films, HD broadcasts and events at the Strand, visit rocklandstrand.com ; call 594-0070, ext. 3; or email info@rocklandstrand.com. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:34:55.678+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
