In the wake of the sacking of Environment and Food Minister Asim Ahmed Khan for allegedly demanding a bribe of Rs 6 lakh from a builder, opposition parties called for a special session of the Delhi Assembly to be convened over the matter and also sought the immediate appointment of a state Lokayukta, a post lying vacant since November 2013. ”The party that has been formed to fight corruption is finding itself in such a position. What about the files that he (Asim) has signed over the past eight months?” asked Ajay Maken, Congress’s Delhi unit chief.

On the other hand, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said that Kejriwal’s attempt to project the matter as a “situation of virtue” was ironical as the former had no other option but to remove the minister. ”One of his ministers has been caught red-handed taking a bribe and there was no option but to sack him. Faced with a situation like this, what Kejriwal is trying to do is make it count,” Patra said. Former Union Minister and Congress leader RPN Singh claimed that had a Lokpal been there, “possibly the whole Delhi Cabinet would have to resign.” ”So many scams even when there is no Lokpal. Had Lokpal been there, imagine how many of these ministers would have been in jail. Possibly the whole Cabinet would have had to give in their resignation,” he said. The AAP government has said it has prepared a ‘Jan Lokayukta Bill’ and would table it in the next session of the Assembly. The name of the Bill is noteworthy as AAP had promised to pass a ‘Jan Lokpal Bill’ in its manifesto. All public officials including the Chief Minister other Ministers and MLAs would fall within its purview, the party had said. Meanwhile, former Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit was more guarded in her reaction and said that such action should be taken only on the basis of strong evidence. ”You cannot just accuse somebody. Our question is that if there is some proof, then the step that he has taken is correct, but if there is no evidence and just an information then I don’t think it is fair to the minister,” she said. \nModified Date: October 9, 2015 8:52 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:17:23.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
