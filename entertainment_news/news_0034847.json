Fallon/Pool Photo via AP, File) \nLOS ANGELES — A judge says former rap music mogul Marion \"Suge\" Knight and comedian Katt Williams should stand trial on robbery charges filed after a celebrity photographer accused the men of stealing her camera. \nLos Angeles Superior Court Judge Ronald Coen says prosecutors have shown enough evidence to support the charges. \nCoen ruled Tuesday after hearing from the photographer who described suffering a concussion and other injuries after an associate of the men attacked her in Beverly Hills in September. \nA police detective also testified that surveillance footage showed Williams holding the camera after the attack. \nKnight's attorney, Thomas Mesereau, argued that his client hadn't participated in the robbery, but Coen said there was evidence he aided and abetted the attack. \nMesereau says Knight was upset because the photographer had shot images of his son. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T21:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:35:52.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
