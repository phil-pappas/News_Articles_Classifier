On the aforementioned date, the sequel to \" Kingsman: The Secret Service \" will compete against animated movie \" Cars 3 \". Filming is scheduled to begin in April. It was previously revealed that leading actor Taron Egerton had a scheduling issue because he had to shoot \" Robin Hood: Origins \" in February. Fortunately, Lionsgate compromised its plan and decided to start filming the Robin Hood reboot after \"Kingsman 2\" wraps production. Egerton is the only confirmed cast member so far. Meanwhile, Colin Firth is rumored to reprise his role as agent Harry Hart despite the fact that the character was killed at the end of the first film. Matthew Vaughn is currently writing the screenplay of the \"Kingsman\" sequel, which he previously revealed would feature an American version of the British Kingsman agency. Comic book creator Mark Millar has strongly suggested that Vaughn will also return as director, but it has yet to be confirmed. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Kingsman: The Secret Service 2 News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T12:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:53:02.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
