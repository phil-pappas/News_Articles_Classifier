With 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' hitting theaters Dec. 18, we take a look at some of the images from the movie that will see the return of Luke, Leia and Han, along with a new generation of the Force. First we have the official poster for the film. Lucasfilm The third trailer for the movie focused on the villains, including Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Lucasfilm But there was plenty of time for the heroes, from Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) ... Lucasfilm Rey (Daisy Ridley) appears in 'The Force Awakens.'

Abrams' movie arrives Dec. 18 in theaters, and the bad guys themselves arrive in style. But so does a new heroine in Rey, a scavenger from Jakku who's shown at the opening of the trailer doing her thing and sees the arrival of Finn, a former First Order Stormtrooper whose TIE Fighter crashes and begins his new journey. \nThis trailer more than the two previous ones is hitting hard on the emotion and history involved with this universe. Finn was seemingly raised to be in the First Order, and the trailer shows how he is escaping his service: \"I've got nothing to fight for.\" (Though there is a question of how he comes to claim his own lightsaber.) \nAs for Rey, who's hanging around with droid pal BB-8 when she meets Finn — and a bunch of attacking First Order folks — she tells Han Solo (Harrison Ford), who may have the wise old Obi-Wan Kenobi-esque role this time around, that she's heard all the stories. His response: \"The Dark Side, the Jedi, they're real.\" This is set 30 years after the destruction of the Death Star and the apparent takedown of the Empire, so there's a sense that a lot has changed in those three decades. \nHarrison Ford's Han Solo seems to be the wise old man this time around in 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens.' (Photo: Lucasfilm) \nMeanwhile, there's a definite sense of purpose for the masked Kylo, another new character played by Adam Driver. ​\"Nothing will stand on our way,\" he says, looking out over the universe and promising to finish what Vader started. He's shown holding Vader's burned mask, with his troops on the march, torturing Poe with a little of the ol' Dark Side of the Force and razing places like he's looking for something or someone. Could he be kin to the Sith lord formerly known as Anakin Skywalker? It seems like he has the same nasty demeanor. Heroes are front and center on new 'Star Wars' poster \nWhile there are new villains — we also get a glimpse of Gwendoline Christie's chrome Stormtrooper leader known as Captain Phasma — there's a new crop of heroes in the Resistance. Finn and X-wing pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) give each other a bro pat as they scramble to the ready. Yay, team!

One main man missing is Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker, the hero of the original Star Wars trilogy. There's a shot included from the last trailer where it seems like it's him touching his old droid R2-D2, yet Abrams appears to be keeping him off screen for a reason. \nFinn and Kylo are going to have a huge lightsaber fight, which looks pretty epic, but there's so much more for the Star Wars faithful with space battles between X-wings and TIE Fighters, Solo and Chewbacca again with their hands up in captured mode (you can just hear Solo saying in his head, \"I've got a bad feeling about this\") and that blistering and majestic John Williams score. \nThe Force isn't just awakening. It's back. 5819 CONNECT 573 TWEET 4 LINKEDIN 106 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1LHquyU TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T16:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:36:07.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
