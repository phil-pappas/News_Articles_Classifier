The funnywoman shared her experience of playing the lead role in \" Trainwreck \" and being told to lose weight. \"I assumed they would cast a beautiful, model-y actress to play the lead role, like a Blake Lively ,\" she said. \"They were like, 'No, we want you to be in the movie - we just need you to do three things. One: Just be yourself. Two: Have fun! And three: Stop eating food.\" \"I was like, 'Wait a minute ... don't people need food to live?' And they were like, 'That's a myth,' \" she added. \"I was like, 'You guys! I don't even like food, I was just eating it 'cause I was bored. Yuck! Who wants to chew and eat food all the time?\" She quickly deadpanned, \"Me.\" Schumer also talked about sex. \"I just think that sex is explained incorrectly as far as men and women's roles go,\" she said. \"It's like we're all told over and over again men love sex, and women just deal with it.\" She went on, \"You're made to feel really weird and disgusting if you're a girl who loves to have sex.\" \"I'm labeled a sex comic,\" the comedienne shared. \"I think it's just 'cause I'm a girl. I feel like a guy could get up here and literally pull his d*ck out, and everyone would be like, 'He's a thinker.' \" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T16:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T21:49:01.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
