I believe to talk about the fate of the film on behalf of the makers is wrong. I am just a representative of the project. I am not the maker.\nSo any details regarding 'Shuddhi' or any other film should always be discussed with the people who make the film.\"\nThe 22-year-old actress, meanwhile, is excited about her other upcoming film \"Udta Punjab\" which stars Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor.\nOn working with Kareena, she said, \"We haven't done any scenes together but I had the opportunity to be around her (Kareena).. see her. We spent one whole day together. It was a 'Shaandaar' (her upcoming film) experience.\"\nOn comparisons with her industry senior, Alia said,\"There can be no way where there can be comparisons between us.\"\nInitially, \"Shuddhi\" was to star Kareena Kapoor and Hrithik. But it got derailed due to Hrithik's health issues leading to his exit following which Kareena also walked out.\nLater, Salman Khan was roped in but after some time he also opted out.\n\"Shuddhi\" is being produced by Karan Johar and directed by \"Agneepath\" helmer Karan Malhotra.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:07:32.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
