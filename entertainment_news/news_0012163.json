It's about finding what works for you. And I'll share the things that have worked for me.'' \nKate - who has sons Ryder, 11, with former husband Chris Robinson and four-year-old Bingham with ex fiance Matt Bellamy - revealed she and her friends motivate each other and try not to focus on the negatives. \nShe told Allure magazine: ''I have friends I've told the same story to 500 times. And you're like, 'But I need to talk about it, again and again and again.' One of my girlfriends and I made this decision: We're going to give ourselves three days. We're going to talk about these two subjects, ad nauseam. Then we're done. It was like breaking a bad habit.'' \nAnd Kate also revealed that she and her exes have remained friendly for their children. \nShe said: ''Relationships ending are painful, and you can choose to carry that or you can choose to reframe it. If Matt and I had a great relationship, we would still be together, but we chose to move on because we had different visions of how we wanted to live our lives. That doesn't mean, though, that we can't rebuild something that would be the best thing for the kids.''
