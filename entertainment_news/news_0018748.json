Thank you mi gente, love ya forever and a moon!\"\nCastro – known on the air as \"Xavier Da Freakin Rican\" wrote this on his pages: \"Just want to say I love all of you. Best listeners on the planet.\"\nIn a personal message, Castro, who has five kids, indicated he couldn't comment on details of his or other cuts, but did confirm that he was gone from KBBT as of Tuesday. \"I'm unable to speak much due to contract stipulations,\" Castro wrote. \"I am no longer employed by Univision as of yesterday.\"\nMeanwhile, radio industry websites are buzzing with the news.\nRadio Insight stated that Univision had cut back on its morning shows not only in San Antonio, but in New York.\n\"We've also heard a few part-timers have been let go from the San Antonio cluster,\" the article mentioned.\nAs for an official explanation of these abrupt dismissals, Monica Talan, executive vice president of corporate communications at Univision Communications, sent a press release regarding the changes, but didn't mention by name the cuts of the city's veteran voices. Paraphrased, the release reads:\nUnivision San Antonio today announced programming changes at KXTN 107.5FM and KBBT 98.5FM that will engage San Antonio listeners across two of the most popular music genres in the region – Tejano and Hip Hop/R&B.\nKXTN welcomes the return of Tejano personality Big Boyee to the station. Big Boyee and Jammin J Javi will be on the air Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m., effective immediately. They will continue playing Tejano music favorites. DJ Homie Marco will serve as programming director (replacing Ramirez, who previously held that title) at the station.\nUnivision's KBBT 98.5FM, No. 1 one station for Hip Hop and R&B in San Antonio, is also pleased to welcome \"The Dana Cortez Show\" to its airwaves beginning Nov. 9. The show will be live in San Antonio from 6 to 10 a.m. Monday through Friday.\n\"KXTN 107.5 FM is an iconic station within the Tejano community and we are pleased to continue that legacy. The addition of Big Boyee and Jammin J Javi reinforces our commitment to the genre and to our audience's vast appetite for Tejano music,\" said Chris Morris, vice president and general manager, Univision San Antonio. \" 'The Dana Cortez Show,' with its signature style and energy, will be a terrific addition to San Antonio's leading Hip Hop and R&B station.\"\njjakle@express-news.net\nTwitter: @jaklej", "external_links": ["http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/25/7828840/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/36/7829437/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/25/7828831/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/43/7829729/6/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/36/7829436/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/75/8826730/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/30/7829050/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/35/70/46/7833994/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/35/70/64/7834892/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/06/54/77/1757143/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/31/7829096/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/23/7828707/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/30/7829052/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/02/17/66/589228/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/25/7828841/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/35/70/46/7833994/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/25/7828831/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/25/7828844/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/43/7829729/6/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/14/25/26/3233215/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/25/7828842/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/30/7829049/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/06/54/77/1757143/9/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/35/70/46/7833993/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/75/8826728/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/75/8826730/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/25/7828845/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/25/7828830/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/25/7828832/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/30/7829050/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/31/7829090/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/35/70/46/7833992/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/02/17/66/589228/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/25/7828845/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/25/7828840/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/30/7829051/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/31/7829091/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/31/7829090/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/35/70/46/7833993/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "https://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/94974/univision-makes-morning-cuts/", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/31/7829096/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/25/7828830/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/75/8826728/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/23/7828707/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/14/25/26/3233215/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/25/7828847/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/31/7829091/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/35/71/05/7835995/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/36/7829436/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/30/7829051/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/35/70/46/7833992/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/30/7829049/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/30/7829052/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/25/7828847/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/35/70/64/7834892/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/25/7828832/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/36/7829437/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/25/7828842/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/23/7828709/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/25/7828844/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/25/7828841/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/23/7828708/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/35/71/05/7835995/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/23/7828709/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/23/7828708/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T20:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:39:28.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
