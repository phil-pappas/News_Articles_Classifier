(PRWEB) October 23, 2015\nAlthough many professional dancers begin dance lessons at a very early age, Helene Andreu did not begin to study it until after she turned 17. What some would consider a disadvantage only made her want to learn more.\nAndreu went on to study at numerous schools, including several years at The School of American Ballet. She sang, danced and choreographed for summer stock and off-Broadway performances, including a stint with The American Savoyards.\nWith years of experience in the world of dance and a master’s degree in dance education, she continued to teach. From two-year-olds to senior citizens, public schools to private dance studios and colleges, Andreu has danced through life with one goal: to help others find fulfillment in dance the way she has.\nShe has pursued that goal through the written word. A lifelong learner herself, Andreu believes it is important for people of all ages to discover things that interest them. Ideal for the classroom or just for fun, Andreu’s new book, “DANCE – An Illustrated History,” provides important background and theory to both longtime lovers of dance as well as those just dipping their toes in the subject for the first time.\n“DANCE – An Illustrated History” highlights the development of dance through the ages. The influence of peoples’ beliefs, cultures, and lifestyles, as well as the functions of dance in various societies are all discussed and richly illustrated with 300 images of dance, including photos, paintings and sculptures. The book explores the background of today’s dances: tap, ballet, modern, and jazz, while also looking into the early dances of many countries.\nDANCE – An Illustrated History\nBy Helene Andreu\nISBN: 978-1-50492-046-9\nTrim size: 8.5 x 11\nAvailable in softcover on Amazon, Barnes & Noble and AuthorHouse online bookstores\nAvailable as e-book through AuthorHouse\nAbout the author\nHelene Andreu is the author of “Jazz Dance – An Adult Beginner’s Guide,” “Aerobic Razzmatazz,” “Jazz Dance Styles and Steps,” and “Dance, Movement and Nutrition.”\nMost recently, she has taught History of Dance for Brooklyn Lifelong Learning (formerly Institute for Retirees in Pursuit of Education) at Brooklyn College. Andreu lives in Brooklyn with her sister and cats and enjoys gardening.\n# # #\nFor review copies or interview requests, contact:\nCourtney Alvey\n317.602.7137\ncalvey(at)bohlsengroup.com\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13039563.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13039563.htm"], "published": "2015-10-23T17:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:44:31.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
