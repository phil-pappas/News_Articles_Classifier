In a statement here, the Chief Minister said, “the present dispensation at the Centre utterly failed to import pulses as a result of which there has been exorbitant rise in the price of the commodity”. ”The BJP-led NDA Government at the Centre is solely responsible for the spiraling rise in the prices of pulses as it failed to import the essential commodity at appropriate time,” he said.

Recalling his tenure as Union Minister of State for Food in 1992, Gogoi said he had imported three million tonnes of wheat to keep the prices of the commodity under check. The Chief Minister also said the present government at the Centre faced scathing criticism from its own Minister for Women and Child Development Maneka Gandhi for squeezing Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) funds. ”If ICDS programmes aimed at fighting child malnutrition is hit by funds crunch then it has ominous portents of further pushing up infant and maternal mortality rates,” he added. \n  4:53 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T14:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T15:31:00.690+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
