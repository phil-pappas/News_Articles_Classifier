Photo: Supplied \nSamantha Bond admits her heart sank on hearing the word \"jam\" when approached about Second World War drama Home Fires . \nComing amid a dearth of roles for middle-aged women, the prospect of being shunted into a world of cakes and jam-making wasn't initially thrilling.\nBut, she explains, the show goes far beyond that. It follows a group of Women's Institute members – the British equivalent of the Country Women's Association – in a small rural community and depicts the vital role played by women during the war.\n\"When we all started we were a bit trepidatious, was it actually going to be a series about women making jam? Indeed, its first title was Jambusters,\" she says.\nAdvertisement \"But the reason the WI made jam was immensely practical, it was all part of the war effort and it was to preserve fruit and to preserve food.\"\nPreserving food – and taking the pressure off the merchant navy to deliver food supplies – was one of the many contributions made by the WI to the war effort, along with knitting socks and scarves for soldiers, writing letters for soldiers without family who were away on active duty, locating iron railings and gates which would be melted down and reused, and housing evacuees. \n\"That was the thing about the WI, they weren't a load of middle-aged housewives trying to work out how you pass the time,\" she says. \"A lot of what they did in the war was to aid the government.\"\nHome Fires follows a group of women – a rare female-led ensemble cast – who are adjusting to life as war looms. Season one covers the period up to the outbreak of war in September 1939. Its warm, richly interwoven storytelling also delves into the defining and empowering time it was for women and their changing roles. \nBond, who also plays Lady Rosamund Painswick​ in Downton Abbey and was Miss Moneypenny to Pierce Brosnan's Bond, is Frances Barden, a headstrong leader in the community. Francesca Annis plays her foil, Joyce Cameron, representing the old order and resistant to change. \nBased on the non-fiction book Jambusters, by Julie Summers, which documents the wartime WI, the series has been a huge success in Britain, gathering more than 6 million viewers in its primetime Sunday night slot. With filming for season two now under way, Bond says she believes its success is down to its sense of community. \n\"I think that's what people got attached to because it's what people yearn for and, certainly in lots of bits of Britain, it's become a rare thing.\"\nShe says one of the most enjoyable aspects of the production were the real-life bonds struck among the cast, who were camped out at a hotel together while filming. \n\"The thing about women is that we don't really do small talk. You can't sit at supper for an hour and a half and discuss football, so we got to know each other properly very, very fast. Because of the storylines and because there are huge emotional journeys to be made, there was an honesty between us all and very quickly a shorthand between us all which is reflected in what you see in front of the camera. We really are a very tight-knit group now and that happened very fast.\"\nDoes she hope the success of the show pushes other female-led productions into play? \n\"Yes, indeed – an audience doesn't switch off if you're over 45. I do think that there are still extraordinary stories. When I look at myself and my friends and what we've had to deal with, in the last five to 10 years, it's such an extraordinarily grown-up time. \n\"You're talking about suddenly having kids who are approaching adulthood and all the problems that come with that – you think the babies are difficult, you wait until you've got a late teenager. You're talking about parental loss, parents with dementia, friends with cancer. These are not small subjects, these are absolutely as big and much more real than police dramas, frankly.\" \nShe says last year making her debut in a West End musical in Dirty Rotten Scoundrels was the happiest job of her life, but that was then superseded by making Home Fires .\n\"Last year was the most splendid in a 34-year career,\" she says. This year, her splendid run has continued with work on season six of Downton Abbey , plus the second series of Home Fires . \"I'm just feeling slightly smug and very, very happy,\" she says. \nWHAT \nHome Fires\nWHEN \nBBC First, Saturday, 8.30pm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:27:38.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
