Death didn't happen quickly. We all saw the deterioration. He was so very young. We were robbed of something precious. It was devastating. It was hard for all of us, but it was hardest for my mom when we lost Howard. She's never really recovered,\" Black said.\nThe 46-year-old actor, who was 11 years younger than his big brother, still counts his sibling as one of the main inspirations in his life, saying, \"He was a big influence on me. He took me to my first rock concert. He was so vibrant, creative, amazing. He shaped my taste in music.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:37:04.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
