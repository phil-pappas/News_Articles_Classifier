Its magazine had a total paid and verified circulation of 22.8 million as of 2014. \nThe second-most-circulated magazine is another AARP publication, boasting circulation of 22.2 million in the same year. \nPerhaps most telling about the decline of the adult magazine is its slow disappearance from newspaper stands. The Times notes that many have been relegated to \"specialist stores\" instead. \nPlayboy's biggest foes now, according to The Times' Somaiya, are digital news outlets like the $2.5 billion juggernaut Vice Media, which could be eating Playboy's lunch at the moment, with an entire vertical dedicated to the genre that made Playboy famous.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T14:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:54:17.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
