He's taken just 12 defensive snaps, relegated to special teams contributor. \nNeedless to say, it's not where either figured to be in the Steelers' plans just seven weeks ago. Frustrated? You could say that. \n\"I try to stay positive all the time,\" Allen said. \"You'll never really see me down because I'm a big picture guy. If I can't do something here, then somewhere else I can help or something I can do to help to be successful and I'll find that.\" \nIt remains uncertain if he'll ever find that in Pittsburgh. Same with Boykin. \nAllen signed a five-year, $26 million contract extension on the eve of the 2014 season and has been beset with injury and ineffective play since. He was supposed to be one of the cornerstones of the new-look defense but was effectively supplanted as a starter by Antwon Blake even before his injury in the season opener. \nAllen has since returned to practice, albeit limited, and is hoping to return when his knee allows it. \n\"You have to feel like you're capable to do the job that they ask you to do, whatever they ask you to do,\" he said, \"Without putting the team in jeopardy, without being selfish.\" \nEven if Allen returns, he's now down on the depth chart, behind both Blake and Ross Cockrell, who both have interceptions this season. \nThe Steelers sent a conditional fifth-round pick, which could turn into a fourth-rounder contingent upon his playing time, to the Eagles for Boykin. Barring unforeseen circumstances, that will likely stay a fifth-rounder. Boykin has played in just 2.8 percent of Pittsburgh's defensive snaps. \n\"I'd like to be playing, but that's out of my control,\" Boykin said. \"That's a coach's decision. I can only control what I can control and that's my effort and preparation.\" \nAllen has six career interceptions or the same number that Boykin had in 2013 alone with the Eagles, who drafted him in the fourth round in 2012. \nWith Blake attempting to play through a thumb injury -- he was victimized for 107 yards and a TD against Arizona last week -- it could mean more significant playing time for Boykin as a slot corner in sub-packages this week against the coach who drafted him in Philadelphia. \n\"Brandon is feisty,\" said Chiefs coach Andy Reid, who held the same title in Philadelphia from 1999-12. \"He's quick, tough, tough-minded kid. Not the biggest guy, but he makes up for it with his grit.\" \nPlaying Boykin would make some sense this week as he's familiar with Reid's offense and Chiefs receivers Jeremy Maclin and Jason Avant, his former Philadelphia teammates, from having regularly practicing against them. \n\"It'll be cool seeing everybody,\" said Boykin. \"It'll be a good reunion. \n\"Similarities are there but I'm sure they're going to have some kind of twist for whatever our defense is doing.\" \nThe question is when Boykin or Allen will be part of that defense anytime soon.
