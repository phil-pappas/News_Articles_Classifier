STADIA is a leading resource for high-level sports infrastructure, and its latest issue has selected the Videotron Centre as a \"sports and entertainment destination\" and devoted a feature article to the arena.\nThe Videotron Centre shares the limelight with other big names, such as the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympic Stadium and the Bordeaux stadium, home of the FC Girondins from the Champions League.\nAn amphitheatre designed with the DNA of Quebec City\nThe publicity will benefit the architectural team as the eyes of the world turn to Quebec City . STADIA describes in detail the vision of the project's chief architect and his integrated team of SAGP engineers and architects (SNC Lavalin, ABCP Architecture, Gagnon Letellier Cyr Ricard Mathieu Architectes, and Populous), who developed the amphitheatre in the image of Quebec City , brilliantly reflecting its northern character and beauty. Thanks to these expert partners, the architectural team was able to deliver one of the best amphitheatres in the world.\nThe architects say they are delighted with the results and recognition. \"It's great to receive this attention and reach such heights with our first amphitheatre. We are proud that our group's DNA is reflected in the exterior of this facility and is recognized at an international level,\" says François Moreau, architect and CEO of ABCP Architecture.\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=C4057&Transmission_Id=201510131328CANADANWWEB______C4057&DateId=20151013", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:05:25.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
