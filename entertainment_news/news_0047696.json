Mealie was suspended with pay in March pending the results of an internal investigation. \nSeveral community members, including Mealie’s mother Charlene Geffel and sisters Terry Mylan and Laura Nichi, spoke on Mealie’s behalf during public comment. Each of the community members spoke of Mealie’s passion for the district and its children, expressing disbelief at her suspension and resignation. \n“It’s when we stop caring that things are going to fall down,” said Mylan, who is running for school board this fall. “Megan never stopped caring even though there were problems. She continued to fight.” \nBoard president Jeremy Angus could not comment on the specific personnel issues surrounding Zurchin’s sick leave and Mealie’s resignation. The board is actively working to come up with the next steps it will take, he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:55:03.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
