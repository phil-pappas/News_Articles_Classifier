Grab your lover, grab your friend, grab some ass and never make amends. \nKhloe Kardashian and Lamar Odom \n(You're too soon.) \nIn light of Khloe's ex-husband Lamar not waking up face-down in Vegas brothel concrete — and the \"estranged\" Kardashian remaining steadfast by his bedside while he comas it off — this could make for a creative Halloween costume. \nKhloe: An ass-baring trampfit, a metric ton of makeup, a padded Armenian booty and a name tag that reads, \"Hello, My Name is Pushover.\" Fantz \nOdom: CNN told me that a \"pinkish fluid\" was coming out of his mouth and nose. Do with that as you may. Blow some lines of baking soda, affix a condom to your fly and ... PSA ... Don't blackface it, fools. A simple Heat, Lakers, Mavericks, or Clippers jersey will suffice (what an NBA village bike). \nAnd stilts, of course. \nA millennial and a Gen-Xer \nYou two can punch it out Mike Tyson- or Pikachu-style with these generational divides. (Mike Tyson, millennials, is more than that face-tattooed \"actor\" who jams ass to Phil Collins. And Pickachu, dearest old bastards, is a yellow Pokémon. Go back to sleep. Both of you.) Advertisement \nMillennial: (male) Tight, cuffed pants, messenger bag, full beard, craft beer, craft beer shirt, craft beer pins and suede derby shoes. (female) Leggings, cropped sweater, boat shoes, round shades. (both) Selfie sticks. \nGen-Xer: Doc Martens, flannel shirts and a Nirvana T-shirt. Wait. That's what you fuckers wear now. Maybe some Fresh Prince of Bel-Air flair? Grunge, goth or glam-rock. Whatver. Just keep those bangs high. \nRandy Quaid and Uncle Eddie \nOnetime actor Randy Quaid now looks like Mr. Claus French screwed an electric socket. I lost track of his alleged law-breakage, but recently saw a photo of him and he looks amazing. \nHis portrayal of one of my favorite characters, Uncle Eddie in National Lampoon's \"Vacation\" movies, you and a pair should play him and his alter ego. \nRandy Quaid: You need an unkempt Santa beard and a frizzy white wig, some black-rimmed glasses (you already have) and bathrobe over transient garb. Talk to your \"wife\" on your iDildo. \nUncle Eddie: Cigar dangling from lips, tighty-whities under a bathrobe, trouser socks under slippers and a trooper aviator flap hat. \nPoop emojis \nWhen someone poops or farts, we laugh. And now we can enjoy the puerile humor via smartphone. \nCraft a pair of turds by draping a hoop skirt in brown material and make the emoji face with white felt. \nKeep it pretty, fools. You make mama proud. \nRead more Fantz: coloradodaily.com/columnists .
