We kept saying no. A food truck? How stable is that? We’ll write the story, and he’ll be gone next week, is what we thought. Cecil’s, though, has staying power, and since he’s still around and as popular as ever, we decided to visit the truck with Gina on a chilly fall afternoon. Gina’s Take Gina first found out about Cecil’s through work friends. He has a connection to her job at All About Trees. “He always cooked for everyone,” she says. “He finally opened his own spot.” And why is Gina hooked? “His food is a quick option for real food.” Real food? “His food is 100 percent from scratch,” she says. “You know you’re getting real good-for-you-food. He doesn’t even have a fryer in there,” she says. \nGina Branch (Photo: Katie Tonarely) \nTypically, she visits Cecil’s To Go when he’s at the Farmers Market of the Ozarks on Thursday evenings and Saturdays. She’s had just about everything on the menu, and today she opts for the special, the Cubano sandwich ($9 for the combo), and she gets a salad and drink with it, too. She orders sesame ginger dressing for her salad. “It’s insane,” she says. “He makes the salad dressings, too. He also tries to get his veggies local and from the Farmers Market of the Ozarks vendors when he can.” And the sandwich? “He makes his bread every morning,” Gina says. “Oh my gosh, look at it. It’s huge!” she says of the sandwich. Her pressed sandwich comes loaded with lots of meat, and she loves how the cheese and mustard pull all of the flavors together. “It’s perfectly grilled,” she says. “This bread is perfect for this sandwich.” Katie’s Take When Gina first recommended Cecil’s to Go, I, of course, was game, because it involved food. However, I do like to be cautious with food trucks. When Gina approached me about covering his food again, I had to say yes. This guy clearly has staying power. When Gina decides on the Cubano, I get a little jealous, because I want to eat it, but I want to cover as much as possible, so I opt for the Jerk Chicken ($8 for the combo), which seems to be a hit on social media when I check out Cecil’s To Go before I head north. Though I’ve tried several of our town’s food trucks, I’ve never lunched at the actual SGF Mobile Food Park. This whole area is like a secret north-side world, but clearly others know about the secret, because the lunch crowd is steady. When our sandwiches arrive, Gina says, “Grab napkins. They’re both messy, but worth it.” I’m game. Not much is better than a juicy, messy sandwich. My Jerk Chicken is slightly spicy, but not overly so. The sauce pools at the bottom of the pita bread, and I only wish I had a more even distribution of the sauce, but I’m a sauce gal, and there’s never too much sauce for me. I’m shocked when Gina tells me that he makes his own pita bread. For real? In a food truck? What witchcraft is this? Color me impressed. I also have a bite of Gina’s Cubano and have severe order envy. It’s grilled perfectly, and that bread is seriously amazing. Knowing that Cecil makes it himself makes me like it even more. As a side, I get the quinoa and bean salad. It’s light and has lots of veggies. It’s a great complement to my sandwich. I’m surprised that it has garbanzo beans, as I was expecting maybe a black or red bean. The Dish, the Restaurant Owner Cecil Manning opened Cecil’s To Go in 2013. “I wanted to be self-employed,” he says. Plus, “I’m a one-man show.” He’s able to control his ingredients, time and final product. Though he’s always wanted a brick and mortar restaurant, having a food truck is a great place to start. And the menu? “It’s just the food I like to eat,” he says. He varies his menu depending on the season. He’s not hooked on specific recipes. For instance, the quinoa bean salad I had with my sandwich will often change ingredients depending on what he has available or how he feels that day. “It just depends on what I decide to do,” he says. “It’s a very light and refreshing salad.” He uses that philosophy in pretty much every aspect of his cooking, too.

He also makes the marinade for the Jerk-style chicken. “The jerk sauce that I make from scratch is very spicy,” he says. “And then I add a little bit of cheese to pull the sandwich together.” Manning suggests that diners stay connected to his Facebook page to know where he is all of the time. “And they should expect the freshest food they can get, depending on the season.” And though he’s still mobile, with a Cubano and flatbread like Gina and I enjoyed, it’s likely Cecil’s To Go will be around for a while.
