The event is named after the bontebok, an African antelope that also has a home at Binder Park Zoo. \nThe bands Hey Monea and Seabird are scheduled to perform at the event, which also will feature grilled food from Taste of the Wild Catering, a commemorative glass to take home and shuttle service to Holiday Inn Battle Creek. \nOh, and many of the craft breweries in southwestern Michigan will be represented. \n“It’s just kind of a unique place for people to come in, those who are beer enthusiasts, to be able to sample the wares from all of these different breweries,” Parker said. “It’s also great because they’re helping to support Michigan businesses as well.” \nParker said several breweries will have their beer available, with representatives on hand. Names familiar to any craft beer fan make up the list: Dark Horse Brewing Co., Bell’s Brewery, New Holland Brewing, Founders Brewing Co. and several others are participating. \nA bontebok grazes on the Wild Africa savannah at Binder Park Zoo.

For an extra cost, people can check out the VIP tent where different food and beer, and live sports on TV will be available. \nArcadia Ales of Battle Creek and Kalamazoo will be there, and owner Tim Suprise said the brewery’s made up a batch of an Oktoberfest-style beer to go with the event. The beer also will be available for purchase in stores. \nSuprise said it’s a beer that’s very drinkable and good for those trying craft beer for the first time, which goes along with the Oktoberfest theme. \n“The Oktoberfest celebration in Germany is huge throughout the world,” Suprise said. “You get a number of people who are exposed to that festival the first time. The style that’s most often served is a beer that’s very approachable. It gets people that may be wine drinkers.” \nSuprise’s brewery is appearing at the event coming off some high recognition for its products. At the 2015 Great American Beer Festival in Denver, Arcadia’s India Pale Ale came away with the silver medal for its category. \n“That beer is my go-to beer and I think it’s just an extremely well-balanced IPA that got some recognition that I think it deserves,” Suprise said. \nWhatever one chooses to drink, Parker said the zoo is promoting drinking responsibly through cheaper designated driver tickets and offering the Holiday Inn shuttle service, where the zoo has made room packages available. \nAnd, Parker said, the breweries benefit from the night as well. \n“It gives them a little attention and exposure,” Parker said, “and it’s also helping bring people to the zoo that might not have otherwise come because they think grown ups can’t come to the zoo.” \nContact Andy Fitzpatrick at 269-966-0697 or afitzpatrick@battlecreekenquirer.com.
