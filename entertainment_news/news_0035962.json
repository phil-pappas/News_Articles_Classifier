Open them out, feel them and turn them into the greatest courage you are capable of.\"\n3. \"It's OK to be confused. Confusion is the route to all the clarity in the world.\"\n4. \"Art is more important than the artist - have no attachment to your own art - it's regressive, move on.\"\n5. Study hard. Work hard. Play harder. Don't be bound by rules. Don't hurt anybody, and never ever live somebody else's dream.\n6.
