Comment Posted Oct. 23, 2015 at 9:08 AM Updated at 12:30 PM Posted Oct. 23, 2015 at 9:08 AM Updated at 12:30 PM Evangeline Lilly and her longtime boyfriend Norman Kali have welcomed their second child, People reports. No further details were released. The Lost alum and Kali are already parents to son Kahekili, 4. While Lilly, 36, kept her pregnancy under wraps until she debuted her baby bump at the Ant-Man premiere in June, she has never been shy when it comes to discussing how much she enjoys motherhood. \"Becoming a mother has really helped me put my feet on the ground and given me a very powerful sense of self and a powerful sense of priority in life,\" she said in January. \"All I have to do is see my son to do that mental check that says, Is this really important? Do you really need to be doing this? Do you really care? It helps put everything in perspective when things get stressful or when there's a demand or pressures on me. At the end of the day, it's our family, it's being a mother and a partner and seeing love all around.\" Other Links From TVGuide.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:46:23.830+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
