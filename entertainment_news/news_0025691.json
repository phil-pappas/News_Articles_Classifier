It was with a certain arrogance, therefore, that I began watching The Walk. Other than the obvious high-wire gimmicks, what could possibly be new about the film that I have to write about? I’d say it was pure, unadulterated terror! \nTo understand why, I’d have to start at the end of the film. So, the protagonist (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) takes a deep breath, shoves his apprehensions aside casually and takes the first step on the wire, held tight at both ends and suspended mid-air with screws and bolts between the Twin Towers in New York City. What you get is a gasp-inducing and hand-wringing 20-30 minutes that brought my fast-beating heart somewhere inside my mouth. \nWould he plunge to his death with his next step? Is the pigeon that flies by a bad omen for things to come? While he walks back-and-forth between the Towers (no, that wasn't a typo…he really did walk a few times), would the wire snap? THAT right there — the nail-biting adrenaline rush is something you can never be prepared for, even if you have read the book and/or watched James Marsh’s Oscar-award winning documentary about Petit, Man on Wire (2008). \nWhile the documentary painstakingly analyses Petit’s actual walk, it lacked the video of the stunt, which are not available. It did have vivid photographs of the performance and told a courageous story of the man and his team. The movie fills this gap and makes you feel like you're watching the stunt live. For the uninitiated, Petit gets an epiphany during a visit to the dentist. A photo of the Twin Towers in construction catches his eye and what he decides then forms the rest of the story. On his way to achieving his dream, he meets his love interest Annie (Charlotte Le Bon) and a bit later bumps into ‘Papa’ Rudy (Ben Kingsley with an indecipherable accent that is supposedly Czech) — a tightrope walker in a local circus, who trains him for a fee and throws in a bit of wisdom now-and-then for free. Along with a few other co-conspirators, Petit realises his dream, or what he calls an ‘artistic coup’. \nDirector Zemeckis’ USP of using the protagonist to narrate the story, as it was in Forrest Gump (1994), is useful here as it reduces the time taken to lay out Petit’s past about the relationship with his unsupportive parents and his creative ambitions. It also makes for a compelling story, which eventually leads to the walk that Petit did in 1974. \nYes, the walk was completely illegal, and the film does not attempt to justify it as anything other than a man’s single minded focus to attempt the impossible — take a stroll or two between the Twin Towers at 1,630 feet above the ground without a safety net. It is also an attempt to humanise Petit and those around him. It has become fashionable to use 3D in many movies but in The Walk, it’s a tool that puts the viewer right on the wire along with Petit. If you're afraid of heights, chances are that you'd throw-up after the film or suffer from vertigo. However, it’s an experience that would stay with you for a long time — almost as if you watched Petit live.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:25:08.249+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
