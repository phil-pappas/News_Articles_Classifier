For a low price, these boats could deliver you to the delights of Ilfracombe, Weston-super-Mare or the Clyde Riviera.\nIn their heyday of the 50s and 60s, the paddle steamers offered working-class families an affordable chance to get away from the factory and the overcrowded flat, and the fact that the steamer made a short journey over water allowed you to feel you were going abroad. Also, the strict rules about drinking didn’t apply when you were at sea, so passengers were able to indulge in the heady freedom of a drink at any hour: “high teas on the high seas”.\nShare article\nWith glamorous onboard entertainment, easy drinks and the liberation of leaving drudgery behind onshore, these old boats gave a taste of what the upper classes might feel when traversing the Atlantic, so they became known as “the People’s Liners”: a chance to taste a little bit of the high life. The programme is filled with colourful archive footage of cheery passengers on deck, wrapped up against the breeze, perhaps with a brandy in hand, and reminiscences from passengers about their first experience as children in the 50s as they took off for the bright lights of Ilfracombe.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-21T00:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:30:18.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
