Photo: Steven Siewert \nA campaign to bring Hollywood superstar Hugh Jackman to Bunbury was nipped in the bud before it was able to start.\nThe Bunbury Regional Entertainment Centre (BREC) sent a letter to Mr Jackman inviting him to attend its 25th anniversary celebrations last week however, he politely declined.\nWAtoday understands Mr Jackman's schedule was entirely booked out during the time of the anniversary celebrations which is why he was not able to come to Bunbury.\nHowever, BREC's media department was not made aware of this and launched the campaign without realising he had already said no to the invitation.\nAdvertisement A Bring Hugh Jackman to Bunbury Facebook page - since removed - and a social media hashtag #broadwaytobunbury were set up as part of the failed campaign. \nMarketing manager Kelsie Miller said â€‹the 25th anniversary was a significant milestone hence the attempt to have a large-scale celebrity to attend the celebrations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:28:52.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
