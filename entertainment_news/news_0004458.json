Not that I've actually worked to make it happen -- come on, that would take years of sustained effort. But I've led countless family rhythm get-downs while driving (beating on the steering wheel, with a splash of dash) and during meals (pounding on the kitchen table). It's how I work out my inner John Bonham, my inner Tito Puente and Elvin Jones.\nThat inner urge is what led me to the home studio of percussion virtuoso Galen Lemmon. Our job: to perform along with \"Clapping Music,\" an app that turns a composition by Steve Reich into a game that improves your rhythm. Reich is a Pulitzer Prize winner -- many rate him as the greatest living American composer -- whose music is as intricately crafted as a Swiss watch. It grooves, too. He composed \"Clapping Music\" in 1972 after returning from a trip to Ghana, where he studied with a master drummer named Gideon Alorwoyie.\nIn the percussion world, it's become an iconic piece -- and the free \"Clapping Music\" app is a nifty tool for students, as well as for mere drumming wannabes. Like you-know-who. (Go to clappingmusicapp.com. You'll find a link to the Apple Store download page.)\nThe game brings Reich's music within striking distance, isolating its 12 interlocking rhythmic patterns, allowing the user to practice each one at \"easy,\" \"medium\" and \"hard\" tempos by tapping one's finger along with the beat on the screen of an iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch. An audio clap track plays while a pictorial representation of each pattern glides before your eyes: rows of circles that show you when to tap and when to stay silent.\nIt's tricky at first.\nBut it gets easier.\nLemmon first performed \"Clapping Music\" around 1980. He has since taught it to hundreds of junior and senior high school students (at U Music Place in Fremont, Calif., where he runs the percussion program) as well as to music majors at San Jose State University (where he is a faculty member). Originally composed for two hand-clapping musicians, the piece is easily adaptable to larger percussion ensembles. Lemmon's students have played it using tom-toms, wood blocks, vibraphones and marimbas. It's so catchy that \"when the kids have a little rehearsal break,\" he said, \"they'll break out into 'Clapping Music.' I hear them do it all the time.\"\nAs we sat down to play along with the app at his San Jose studio, he explained that the piece is based on \"a very simple idea,\" the gradual transformation of a single rhythm. He likened the process to shuffling cards. \"Each time you're changing something a little bit,\" he explained.\n\"Let's try it,\" he said, taking out his iPhone and entering the user name he had chosen for the app: \"DrumProfessor.\"\nLemmon, who hadn't even practiced, began to glide through Reich's piece. Naturally, he chose the \"hard\" tempo.\nFirst he tapped along with the composition's basic rhythmic line, which recalls an African bell pattern, fundamental to Afro-Caribbean music. Think clave.\nAs the app continued to play the clap track for that pattern, Lemmon locked in with the second pattern, which started one beat -- one \"tap\" -- later than the first. Then he locked in with the third pattern, which started one beat later than the second.\nHe looked super-focused, like a kid playing a video game.\n\"Here we go,\" he muttered, locking in with the fourth pattern.\nHis head bobbed. His foot tapped.\nEach pattern started a beat later than the one before, until the final pattern cycled back into sync with the first. Lemmon was back where he had begun, tapping in unison with that initial African bell pattern.\n\"Phew!\" he said, blowing air as if he were winded. He didn't look it.\nThe words \"Impressive!\" and \"Bravo!\" appeared on his phone's screen.\nLemmon doesn't use a lot of apps. There's one called Amazing Slow Downer that allows him to upload music and play it back at any tempo (without changing the pitch) as he practices the percussion part. It's especially useful to his students, and he thinks \"Clapping Music\" also will be valuable to them.\n\"I think they would love this,\" he said.\nNow it was my turn to play. I pulled out my iPad, setting the app to the \"easy\" setting. Lemmon stood behind me to watch, the congenial professor. He seemed to be sincerely interested in what this novice would do.\nI nailed the first pattern. (I'd been practicing for a day or two.) Ditto for the second, the third, the fourth. Breaking into a sweat, I was pretty much sailing through \"Clapping Music\" -- until I blew it midway through the 10th pattern.\n\"Better luck next time,\" the screen told me.\nLemmon wanted to play one more time.\nHe set the app to a video performance of \"Clapping Music\" by two musicians from the London Sinfonietta. (The Sinfonietta developed the app along with Queen Mary University of London and Touchpress.)\nLemmon watched and played along with the two musicians, first by patting his chest with his right hand, quietly. Then he switched it up, tapping a finger against one of the wooden keys of a marimba. Its brighter timbre brought on a subtle but definite change in the performance; it got funky. Lemmon might have been playing the rhythms on an African agogo or cowbell.\n\"From a musician's standpoint, I'm listening to the groove of the eighth notes,\" he said when he was done. \"For me, that's what it's about.\" He smiled. \"Hey, this is fun.\"\n(c)2015 San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)\nVisit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1738966&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1738966&h=Engaging+one%27s+inner+drummer+with+%27Clapping+Music%27", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1738966"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:06:49.566+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
