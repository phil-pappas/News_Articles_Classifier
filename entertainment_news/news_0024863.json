It completely replaced her in the action-figure version of one of her scenes from the second Avengers flick, and somehow forgot to throw her on some of the covers of the DVD and Blu-ray. \nBut it looks like the studio could really be working on fixing the perception that it doesn't care about female superheros. Earlier this year, it was announced Captain Marvel would be headlining her very own movie.
