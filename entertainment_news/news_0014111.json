But a love of literature and an insistent pull toward academia bring Monroe to her proper calling (she now teaches in the creative writing master of fine arts program at Texas State University). Her journey there moves in fits and starts, interrupted at times by distracting boyfriends and money woes, which send Monroe into intermittent work deemed more fit for women — waitressing and bartending, for example.\nThe old chorus persists throughout, surfacing as Monroe’s self-doubt. While considering her plan to teach at a two-year college after graduate school, she hesitates briefly. “I’d be an old maid schoolmarm, no husband, children, nothing. But I was in too deep,” and so she steams ahead. When asked, around the same time, about her future plans, she says, “Maybe I’ll get a Ph.D. There’s no one around to mind.”\nOnce fully settled into her verboten line of work, she recalls a female student asking her, “So your career happened instead” of early wife- and motherhood? Monroe answers yes, “By accident.”\nThis seems both true and not quite accurate. Though her road to success is littered with roadblocks, Monroe plugs ahead, willful as she evolves into a prized writer and coveted teacher. Though she’s tethered to the narrow expectations of a certain Midwestern generation, she continually quiets the voices that intercede. And there are many.\nHer father tells her she’s “educating herself out of the marriage market,” and he’ll “be done with her for good” if she earns another degree. The male customers at a diner suggest she to move to Las Vegas because “there’s no use sitting on that money-maker.” Love interests tell her she doesn’t like intelligent men, or she’s too diffident to sleep with them — a clever, but demeaning dare. A professor apprises her: “It’s good you’re insecure. Otherwise, with your brains and feminine attributes, you’d scare me.”\nThese unrelenting voices are detritus Monroe shuffles through and sweeps away. She sorts them as she does the antiques, family objects and heirlooms she accrues over the years. Is this junk, treasure, both? What to keep, what to discard? Ultimately, they’re relics, reminders of the trail she’s blazed.\nThe memoir circles through other elements of her life — the demise of her parents’ marriage, a miscarriage, friends who introduce her to the work of writers that fuel her further.\nIt also reveals her fidelity to the domestic sphere: She’s a talented seamstress and collects household items (like doilies) that typically adorn the lifestyle she’s escaping. At the same time, she can hold her own with a car mechanic and executes home renovations with expert persistence.\nMy Unsentimental Education risks falling into several traps. In its overarching trajectory, it’s a story of a woman determined to chart her own course through a maze of confinement. It dances through themes of domesticity, feminism and burgeoning sexuality. It risks becoming a story about the female rise to selfhood, which it is. But it’s also decidedly unique, distinct from the I-Made-It-Despite-the-Odds navel-gazing of many personal tales.\nThe book is a map of Monroe’s road out and up, but also a testament to the distinctive voice she’s honed in the process. While the story moves forward chronologically (for the most part), it occasionally plunges into the past, issuing unpredictable associations and anecdotes that deliver raw and stinging revelations.\nShe describes a younger Debra wishing for a time when “all my selves would match.” She arrives there in the end, or as close as she can come, and the story of her arrival is highly compelling.\nCecily Sailer is a freelance writer living in Austin and manager for creative-writing and literary programs at the Austin Public Library Friends Foundation.\nPlan your life Debra Monroe is among the writers scheduled to appear at the Texas Book Festival, Oct. 17-18 in Austin.
