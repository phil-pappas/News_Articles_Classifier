She also writes her own material, which leans towards a blues-flavoured pop/rock style and showcases her rock solid band’s nicely varied dynamics and some effective twin guitar lines from Lyytinen and Davide Floreno.\nStolen Heart, inspired by Jimi Hendrix after Lyytinen came across a picture of him in one of her mother’s music magazines as a youngster, featured Floreno and Lyytinen in sizzling harmony, and the slow blues ballad You Make Me So Sad allowed Lyytinen to take the volume right down to a whisper as she teased and tempted the front row with her show-womanship and fretboard ability. One of the biggest cheers was reserved, however, for bassist Roger Inniss, whose solo easily matched his colleagues’ improvisations for structure and mobility.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-09T17:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:30:41.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
