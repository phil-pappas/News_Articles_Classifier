Speaking with NME , he revealed the band have recorded five new songs with Matt Skiba of Alkaline Trio , including one titled “Punk Rock Cliche.” Skiba was brought in to play some shows with the other members after frontman Tom Delonge parted from the band. Speaking about working with Skiba Barker says “He’s fun to play with and write with. We’re just getting started but I think we’ve got like four or five songs right now that I’m really, really happy with. There’s a song called 'Punk Rock Cliché' which I love the most right now. It's about friends of ours and their relationships.”\nPhoto by Joshua Blanchard/Getty Images He added “The goal here is to come up with an album and just write,\" he added. \"We don’t put a limit on how many songs we’re gonna write. [We just] Write a bunch of songs and when we feel like there’s an album ready, there’s an album ready. You know, no pressure, no deadlines.”\nBlink-182 ran into trouble earlier this year when Travis and Mark Hoppus released a statement Tom Delonge has quit the band and refused to record a new album with them. This caused Delonge to fire back and say he never left the band. While the whole situation is still murky, Delonge is currently promoting his own “Poet Anderson” novel and is not currently a part of Blink-182. Barker, on the other hand, is promoting his memoir “Can I Say: Living Large, Cheating Death, and Drums, Drums, Drums,” which is out now.", "external_links": ["http://www.alkalinetrio.com/", "http://blink182merch.com/", "http://www.nme.com/news/blink-182/89153"], "published": "2015-10-21T13:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:27:28.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
