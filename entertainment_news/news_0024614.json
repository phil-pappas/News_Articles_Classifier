PHYSICAL: Cockfight performers Joshua Thomson and Gavin Webber will be putting on their show at the Centre of Contemporary Arts this weekend. Picture: JUSTIN BRIERTY Source: News Limited \nTHE ties and traumas of intergenerational relationships are explored in explosive physical theatre at the Centre of Contemporary Arts. \nCockfight , billed as The Office meets Cage Fight , is a two-hander with dancers and co-directors Joshua Thomson and Gavin Webber. \n“It’s highly physical as we both trained as dancers,’’ Thomson, 32, says. \n“It’s an exploration of so many elements, about change of power and the frailty of the human body and it is quite emotional and touching. \n“There is an element of father and son in there – I remember the first time I saw my father cry and how that affected me.” \nCockfight was developed by The Farm with Gavin Webber and Joshua Thomson, working in partnership with Julian Louis and Kate Harman. \nThe dancers will also be giving a dance and physical theatre masterclass at CoCA today from 10am to 11.30am. \nCockfight continues for one more performance tonight at 7.30pm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:41:42.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
