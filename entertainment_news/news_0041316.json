He was later shifted in an ambulance to Vittal Mallya Hospital.\nAccording to the chief cardiologist Dr V.K. Srinivas, who has been treating Shivanna, said, “An angiogram was conducted as there were fluctuations in his heart beat. It was a ten-minute surgery and he is stable and fine. He will be under observation at the hospital for another three days and then he will be discharged.”\nShivarajkumar’s brother Puneet Rajkumar addressing the media\nShivarajkumar’s brother-in-law Madhu Bangarappa, who rushed the star to the hospital, said, “Shivanna complained of pain on his right shoulder and was sweating profusely. He was with his trainer at the time. Geetha (Shivanna’s wife) called me immediately and we rushed him to the hospital. After careful examination, the doctors have said that there is nothing to worry and he needs rest for a couple of days and will be discharged later.”\nAround 5 pm, dressed in a hospital gown, Shivanna came near the hospital window and waved at his fans, who had gathered in large numbers outside the hospital. He assured them that his health was normal, urging them to return their normal chores.\nThe doctors suspect that stress and busy schedule might have taken a toll on Shivanna’s health. His younger brothers Raghavendra and Puneeth stressed that Shivanna is absolutely fine and pleaded with his fans not to spread rumours.\nSandalwood actors, film directors, producers, his friends and well-wishers visited the hospital, praying for his speedy recovery.\nStates: Karnataka South karnataka Bengaluru Sandalwood Shivarajkumar Heart attack Also Read Major fire breaks out at RK Foods factory Crocodile mauls youth’s leg in Moyyar river Motor vehicle department warns vehicle dealers against illegal sale promos Land acquisition for Peripheral Ring Roads: BDA seeks funds from government", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/shivrajkumar%20hospital.gif", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/SHIVRAJKUMAR05.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/shivrajkumar%20hospital.gif", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151007/entertainment-sandalwood/article/sandalwood-star-shivarajkumar-suffers-mild-heart-attack", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-08T11:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:18:04.731+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
