All of which made Young’s night in Inglewood even more remarkable.\nThe show was smartly structured to build from the soft and acoustic to the loud and hard-rocking, with Young slipping onstage almost unnoticed to start the night at an upright piano to sing “After the Gold Rush. The next four songs also featured him alone in a stark spotlight on stage, playing guitar, harmonica and pump organ. Those handful of classics included “My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)”; “Helpless,” a tune from his days as part of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young; and “Old Man.”\nAfter those lovely, wistful, occasionally mournful songs ended, Young was joined by Promise of the Real, his band on the tour and on his most recent album. The group includes Willie Nelson’s sons Lukas and Micah, and formed after Lukas Nelson met drummer Anthony LoGerfo at a Young concert in Los Angeles seven years ago and started playing with him in the drummer’s hometown of Seal Beach.\n“Hold Back the Tears,” with its Texas country-Western vibe, and “Out on the Weekend,” the lovely lead-off track on Young’s classic “Harvest” album, picked up the pace a little, though at the end of the latter tune Young felt the need to explain the progression he had mind: “Hold on,” he said. “We’re going to get through the laid-back part of the show.”\nPromise of the Real has earned praise throughout this tour for its sharp musicianship and vast knowledge of Young’s catalog, and the old guy seemed to be truly enthused by his much younger musical accomplices, feeling comfortable enough throughout each stop on the tour to pull songs out of his time machine such as “L.A.,” a track off his 1973 album, “Time Fades Away,” which online fan sites flagged as not having been performed live since then, and “Burned,” a song from his days in Buffalo Springfield.\nMore than halfway through the night the new album finally got its spotlight with songs such as “A Rock Star Bucks a Coffee Shop,” “People Want to Hear About Love” and “Big Box,” all fitting nicely into that record’s themes and warnings about GMOs and corporate greed. While the lyrics might be a touch on the nose at times – repeated name-checks of the likes of Monsanto, Starbucks and Chevron, for instance – musically, these are strong songs, catchy, with room for Young and the band to expand instrumental sections into hard-rocking jams. (Scattered throughout the show, too, were references – and actual organic seeds – to highlight the dangers Young sees in the way things are going.)\nThe final hour of the show hit hard on the guitar explorations of Young, armed here with his usual black Les Paul, who formed a huddle on stage with his two guitarists and bass player, and soared on flights of electric rock ‘n’ roll, with songs such as “Cowgirl in the Sand” and the set-closing “Love and Only Love” running to 15 minutes long each.\nThat last one wrapped at midnight, after which Young and the band quickly came back for an encore with “Vampire Blues” and then waved goodbye. Though you did get the feeling he could have gone on for another hour if he’d wanted. After all, if rust never sleeps, why should he?\nOrange County roots-rock heroes Social Distortion opened the show, and while most of the crowd was still filtering in – they were done by 8:15 p.m. – they tore through hits such as “Story of My Life,” “Ball and Chain” and “Ring of Fire” with the usual vigor you expect from Mike Ness and Co.\nContact the writer: 714-796-7787 or plarsen@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:07:06.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
