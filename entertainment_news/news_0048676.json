That is how, in the summer of 2014, the 100-meter sprinter from Sierra Leone discovered that, one by one, eight members of his family had died after contracting the Ebola virus. And it was via the same method that he saw his dream of a brighter future crushed last week, with a call from his lawyer informing him he would be deported from the United Kingdom.\n“This is the worst, the lowest point,” Thoronka told USA TODAY Sports by a running track in the London suburb of Finsbury Park on Friday, fighting back tears as he spoke. “Even when I lost my family I thought I could honor their memory with my career and my performances. Now I have nothing left.”\nThoronka absconded from the Commonwealth Games, a multi-sport event for nations that was previously part of the British Empire, when it was staged in Glasgow, Scotland, last summer.\nThe Games coincided directly with the devastation wreaked by the Ebola outbreak, which afflicted around 14,000 and killed an estimated 4,000 in Sierra Leone. Fearing death if he returned home with the rest of his nation’s track and field contingent, Thoronka fled the athletes’ village. He made his way to London, and lived on the streets for four months before receiving some assistance from human rights groups and well-wishers who contributed to an online crowd-sourcing appeal.\nWhile still mourning his family, he found opportunities slowly begin to arise. He was taken in by a local track club, Heathside Athletics, and started working with South Africa-born coach Mike Bense.\n“The raw talent is all there,” Bense said. “When he came to me he was really out of shape and everything had taken its toll on him. You’ve got the bereavement, the stress, living on the streets, not eating or sleeping or training right. But even in the last few weeks he has made great strides.”\nWhile filing a formal appeal to remain in Britain on grounds of hardship, Thoronka, showed enough promise to be offered a scholarship to run at the University of East London and study sports science there.\nThe scholarship, however, was contingent on his appeal, which Britain’s Home Office formally rejected on Wednesday. As the same time Thoronka was talking to USA TODAY Sports, he said his attorneys were planning to inform the government that he would leave voluntarily, likely some time within the next month. Had he not taken that step, he could have been arrested at any time, placed in a detention facility and barred from returning to the UK for up to 10 years.\nAccording to Britain’s Home Office, Thoronka’s claim “did not meet the required thresholds within the immigration rules.”\nThoronka fears homelessness, poverty and possible imprisonment when he goes back to Sierra Leone. “I have nothing there; apart from one sister all my family is gone,” he said. “The facilities to train are very limited. It is not going to be possible for me to be a top athlete. I can’t go to the Olympics. I am worried that because I didn’t come home after the Commonwealth Games the authorities might want to punish me.”\nHe now believes his final chance at an athletic career may be if a college program in the United States takes an interest in him. Thoronka’s best time of 10.5 seconds, achieved as a 19-year-old, would make him competitive at NCAA Division I level.\nCurrently, he physically looks more like a middle distance runner, having shed 12 lbs of muscle mass in the past year, due to a combination of mental duress and rough living conditions. Even so, Bense says he is regularly hitting times of 10.9 seconds in training.\n“America would be incredible for me,” Thoronka said. “It would be the biggest thing, the most perfect dream. But I am scared to dream now. Dreams hurt too much when they die.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T23:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T06:40:40.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
