Producers announced Friday, Oct. 23, 2015 that \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\" will center on an adult Harry and his son Albus Severus. The two-part stage saga begins where Rowling's books ended — 19 years after the boy wizard's epic battle with evil Lord Voldemort. (AP Photo/Joel Ryan, File) \n© 2015 Cox Media Group .
