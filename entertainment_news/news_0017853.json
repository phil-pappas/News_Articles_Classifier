Henson's Cookie Lyon is getting a new love interest on Empire this season. In a new trailer , Adam Rodriguez's Laz Delgado is introduced and apparently he's a concert promoter who has Cookie's attention. \nOn Wednesday's episode of Steve Harvey , Rodriguez opened up about working with Henson again after the two became \"close friends\" thanks to their film, the 2009 drama I Can Do Bad All by Myself. \n\"It is always a little bit awkward to be doing a love scene with somebody you hold so dear,\" Rodriguez admitted. \nThe actor said the two even joked around on set to ease the tension. \"We've just been having fun playing games with each other...trying to see who can make their breath the most difficult to deal with,\" he explained. \nStill, despite the on-set jokes and pranks, filming a love scene was still pretty difficult, Rodriguez said. \"Love scenes are really awkward. You’re in a room with 30 people, so there’s nothing intimate about it,\" he added. \"So you’ve got to try and have fun and make it as comfortable for both of you as possible.\" \nEmpire returns to Fox at 9 p.m Eastern tonight. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:11:55.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
