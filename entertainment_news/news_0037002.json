Nobody knows why people do it, but usually it's never meant in bad taste. Well, no. Sometimes it is.\nIn any case, last night's One Direction gig in Belfast, Northern Ireland saw poor 'oul Mullingar lad Niall Horan get hit with a bit of water whilst he was on the guitar.\nAnd he was DISGUSTED.\nAs you can see, the Gibson SG - favoured by AC/DC's Angus Young - stopped working when the water hit it. But more to the point, Niall Horan could have been electrocuted.\nAnd sure enough, One Directioners lost their minds over the fact they could have lost Mullingar's finest musician since Joe Dolan. If you were wondering why #CanYouRespectNiall was trending on Twitter last night and Ryan Tubridy's jeans and shieuxs on the Late Late, this is why.\n\"it's just a guitar\" \"NO IT ISN'T!

It hurts his big heart.\n— ANormalHumanBeing (@ButtAfreen) October 24, 2015\nListen, we've been at concerts where people have full-force thrown bottles of urine at the people onstage so this is nothing, really.\nBe real, Directioners.\nVia YouTube / Twitter\nMORE: Watch: Harry Styles did an awful Irish impression last night at the 3Arena\nMORE: Review: One Direction @ 3Arena\nMORE: Watch: Niall Horan says he fractured his foot and he 'doesn't know how'.
