The \" Project Runway \" host gave fans a sneak peek of her upcoming Halloween costume which will feature huge fake boobs and ample butt. In the behind-the-scenes photos obtained by PEOPLE , Heidi visited a special effects shop for a costume fitting. The special effect shop was apparently the same shop she visited earlier this month when she posted on Instagram videos and photos of her being covered with plaster for the costume. The blonde beauty smiled from ear to ear while she was surrounded by a crew who was trying to attach a prosthetic butt to her body. Meanwhile, Heidi held her fake boobs so that they stayed in place. In another picture, the crew tried to fit a golden gown to her. A prosthetic mask could be seen molded to her face in another picture. Heidi didn't want to reveal what character she's going to switch to for this year's Halloween. \"This is my 16th year hosting Halloween and I've had 17 costumes, like Lady Godiva, the 'Visible Woman' to a 95 year-old version of myself,\" she told the publication. \"I like to switch it up every year and surprise people.\" Earlier this month, Heidi told her fans that the process of making her costume was extremely unpleasant as it included smearing her face and body with sticky blue liquid which appeared to be plaster. At that time, she said on Instagram, \"So yucky but so worth it in the end.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:07:12.582+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
