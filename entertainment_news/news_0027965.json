You’ll have to remind me,” the 75-year-old says. \nWhen it’s pointed out Oct. 9 is his old Beatles pal John Lennon’s birthday — he would also have been 75 this year — Starr chuckles. \n“Yes, it’s John’s birthday! I spoke to Yoko (Ono) because every 9th of October — I’ve only been twice — they go to Iceland to celebrate John’s birthday. We got an invite this year but, as you know, I’ll be in Vancouver.” \nStarr laughs. \nIf you attended the Beatles drummer’s last Vancouver performance with the latest iteration of his All Starr crew — featuring Todd Rundgren, Steve Lukather (Toto), Greg Rolie (Santana), Richard Page (Mr. Mister), Warren Ham and Gregg Bissonette — at the Hard Rock Casino in Coquitlam last summer, you witnessed a love-in moment where the band sang Give Peace A Chance at the end of the show. \nIn lieu of a Happy Birthday, this is probably how Starr will mark the occasion of Lennon’s birthday at this year’s concert as well, he admits. \n“I went (to Vancouver) quite a bit in the ’70s with a good friend of mine, Harry Nilsson,” he says. “We would go and hang out in Vancouver because it was quite a rocking town.” \n“What I do in Canada — not quite in Vancouver — is that I rehearse the All Starr Band there,” Starr continues. “We’ve done four different bands in Fallsview (Ontario). I love Canada. That’s just how it is. Like most countries, it’s beautiful. Vancouver is on the West Coast and I live on the West Coast now. I’ve always loved the West Coast because it’s warmer. One year I went to Vancouver and then froze my ass off in Toronto.” \nHe laughs. \nStarr indeed has a long history with Vancouver. \n=== \nCLICK HERE TO VIEW MORE PHOTOS , or tap and swipe the image on your mobile device. \n=== \nWhen the famed Mushroom Studios building was sold in 2013 (at the time it was home to Hipposonic Studios), I had the opportunity to sift through piles of old photos. \nThe one that stood out immediately was a shot of Starr and Nilsson flanked by Brent Shindell (Doucette) and Joel Wade from either the late ’70s or early ’80s, giving their best smiles to the camera. \nSpeaking of old photos, Starr recently unearthed a whole treasure trove of his own. Many of the shots are never-before-seen photos taken during his time with The Beatles. \nThe shots were collected and recently published in a beautiful volume entitled Photograph, not just echoing the title of Starr’s biggest single as a solo artist but also paying tribute to his love of photography. It’s often forgotten that Starr was the director of photography for The Beatles’ Magical Mystery Tour television special in 1967 (credited under his real name, Richard Starkey). \n“There’s many shots no one has ever seen before,” Starr says of the pictures in his new book. “The story is very simple: I found this huge box of stuff. I was emptying all of the storage places I have around the world and trying to get it all in one spot. That’s when you realize how much stuff you’ve got. \n“Anyway, the joy was that I found this old trunk of photo albums and negatives — hundreds and hundreds of negatives. There were all these shots from the ’60s that were in there, so I thought, ‘What a great thing I’ve found here!’” \nStarr reached out book publisher Genesis, who immediately agreed to cobble together a book. \nMost of the pictures are taken from Starr’s point of view, which gives them a very personal touch. Candid images of Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison abound, with acolytes Brian Epstein and George Martin also shown with levity in mind. \nStarr makes the book more autobiographical by adding childhood photos and other piece of memorabilia like images of the call sheets for The Beatles’ Cavern Club performances signed by Epstein, and the original scribbled lyrics for Don’t Pass Me By, the first song he both wrote and recorded with The Beatles (on the White Album, but written circa 1964). \nStarr was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist earlier this year, making him the last of the Fab Four to be added outside their work with The Beatles. \nStill, he remains the most prolific, with his 18th solo studio album Postcards From Paradise having been released in March. (Macca has 16 if you discount his albums with Wings.) \nPostcards From Paradise features the assistance of longtime Starr partners Dave Stewart (Eurythmics) and composer/songwriter/arranger Van Dyke Parks (of Brian Wilson/Beach Boys fame), as well as members of the current lineup of the All Starr Band. \nThe album’s title song, much like Photograph, is a nod to Starr’s bygone days with The Beatles, Starr weaving a number of classic Beatles song titles into the lyrics. \n“I was trying to work into a song, ‘the lovers are under Mr. Moonlight’ — John Lennon sang that song,” Starr said. “I had several ideas for a song and I started picking Beatles tracks because I Wanna Hold Your Hand and Love Me Do — they all blend into a love song. Anyway I was finding it difficult to put together so I just gave Todd Rundgren the track and all my words. Between Todd and I, we put it together. And I thought it turned out beautiful because Todd is a big-hearted, soulful man. He acts like a big baby but he’s a soulful man.” \nfmarchand@vancouversun.com \ntwitter.com/FMarchandVS \n=== \nCLICK HERE TO VIEW MORE PHOTOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T00:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T13:19:19.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
