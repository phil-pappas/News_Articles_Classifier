The 35-year-old athlete was found unconscious at the Love Ranch brothel on 13 October in Nevada. \n\"Witnessing Lamar trying to come back to life was the closest Khloe's ever felt to giving birth,\" a source told Hollywood Life. \"Seeing his chest move up and down, him trying to fight his way back to life has to be the most surreal experience of Khloe's life. \n\"Doctors were telling her from the beginning the odds were against Lamar, but she feels Lamar heard them and is fighting desperately to prove them wrong,\" the insider added. \"This is one emotionally see-saw ride Khloe's on. She's hoping Lamar fully comes through so she can get off this up and down ride.\" \nAccording to People, Odom apparently showed first signs of improvement after the 30-year-old Keeping Up With the Kardashians star, who is still legally married to him, said \"I love you\" to the former NBA player . The source said: \"He nodded, and that was the first response we got from him. That was so encouraging.\" \n\"This is the most positive stuff we've had since it happened,\" the insider said. \"We've been on pins and needles. We've got a little bit of hope now.\" \nMeanwhile, a spokesperson for Kardashians revealed they have asked Dennis Hof , the owner of the Nevada brothel not to talk to the media and give interviews. The statement read (via NY Daily News ): \"We reached out to Dennis politely asking him to respect Lamar's (and Khloe's) privacy during this difficult time and refrain from talking to the press. This is a very painful situation, as I know you are aware, and the idea that anyone would use it to seek publicity is really sad.\" More about Lamar Odom", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T13:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:51:14.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
