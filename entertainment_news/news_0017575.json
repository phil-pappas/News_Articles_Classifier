Precious metals, intricate designs, gemstones of all types – and colors. Diamonds are a favorite among many, and you may know that diamonds come in more than just white (or colorless). But did you know how colored diamonds are made? And did you know that Engstrom Jewelers sells them? \nDiamonds are created in the Earth’s mantle, the layer between the crust and the core. Ideal temperatures must be over 2,000 degrees Farenheit, the pressure has to be very intense, and the material needed is carbon. The pressure changes the molecular structure of carbon atoms into that of diamonds way down in the mantle and then the diamonds are brought to the Earth’s surface via kimberlite. Kimberlite a volcanic rock that is the host rock for diamonds, and it transports the gems from deep within the mantle to the surface in the form of magma, erupting from small volcanoes. The magma hits the surface and eventually cools. This is where you can find kimberlite containing diamonds. \nMost of the world’s diamonds are found in South Africa, Russia, Australia, and some have been found in Arkansas. \n“When diamonds are found they look like somewhat clear rocks, not the brilliant, sparkling stones that you see in stores. We have learned to cut diamonds in just the right way to where the light goes in and reflects the colors and the light outward. Professional diamond cutters do that,” explained Greg Engstrom, owner of Engstrom Jewelers. \nDiamonds actually have grain, like wood. Diamond cutters must cut a diamond according to its grain, and since it is the hardest substance on the planet, it can only be cut by other diamonds.
