For starters, Benedetti began on her own, with Alexei Grynyuk accompanying, in a little two-movement Sonata in a minor key by Mozart, K 304, where much of the music seemed to be characterised by stealth, restraint and understatement. This, I considered, could be a risky start: it was being followed by Brahms’ B Major Piano Trio, one of the richest, most golden-melodied pieces in Romantic chamber music: I still swoon to the legendary Stern-Istomin-Rose recording, which is ancient but will live forever in its big, almost wide-screen unfolding of Brahms’ glorious music.\nShare article Promoted stories The Benedetti group’s version of the Trio was almost electrifyingly different. It was infinitely more intimate, which instantly collapsed the broad horizons, drawing the listener in, and creating that magical sense that the composer is speaking just to you. Despite the sheer variety of music throughout the piece, that, to me, was its message. It was captured again and again in the great slow movement, where there was a wondrous stillness, and just at the opening of the finale, where it seemed that the music didn’t want to speak for fear of breaking the spell.\nAnd then, with Scott Dickinson having joined the group, they did it all over again with Brahms’ Second Piano Quartet, his longest work of the chamber music species. I don’t know how anyone else in the audience might have perceived this performance, which was crystal-clear, but I was sat there, utterly rapt, listening to these wizards, these spell-binding musical narrators, weaving their intoxicating tales in abstract musical terms. Abstract, yes, but with precision-tooled accuracy in emotional terms.
