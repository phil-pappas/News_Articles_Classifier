Not pregnant, I'm a five-mile-a-day runner, a swimmer, a vinyasa-doer, but during the early months of both my pregnancies (this is my second), morning sickness knocked me flat—preventing much more than an occasional shuffle around the neighborhood. When I began to feel more myself, I had to reckon with what three months of relative inactivity had done to my stamina and what an inflated abdomen had done to my ability.\n It was—and is—a struggle to accept the circumscribing of your conception of yourself. Not just that you can't run comfortably, but that you can't quite cross your legs, can't touch your toes, and can't do any number of other things that used to be merely part of having a functional body. But all this physical limitation is also very useful as preparation for motherhood. Because motherhood is, I think, about accepting limitations: on your time, on what you want to do, on what you want your child to do. It's basically an 18-year (or never-ending?) reckoning with powerlessness.\nMore From Cosmopolitan Still, when I found out I was pregnant with baby number two, I swore to myself that this time would be different. I'd maintain some semblance of mastery over my body. I'd find more time (and motivation) to exercise; I wouldn't just eat pizza and pasta for 12 weeks straight. Ha. Having a toddler and a career rendered the first goal hopeless. Hormones destroyed the second.\nWhere did these hopeless aspirations come from? At least in part, they come from the same place most women's hopeless goals come from: magazines, advertising, television, the Internet. See all the \"maternity\" clothing websites where the models are so clearly not pregnant, or headlines like \"Kim Kardashian Is Very Pregnant and Very Sexy in These 7 Photos,\" or the scene on Bravo's Odd Mom Out in which the characters joke that a certain svelte socialite is going to give birth to a baby the size of a Diet Coke can. A joke, sure, but still.\nShouldn't pregnant women be exempt from image-oriented pressures? They are, after all, perpetuating the human race. Of course, when has the pragmatism of a concern stopped anyone from indulging it?\nWhile it's still taboo to criticize (or even pay too much attention to) the pregnant body of a woman you know, celebrities' pregnant bodies seem to have become fair game. A few months ago, in response to critics who claimed she was too thin to be healthily pregnant, Jaime King posted a topless photo of herself on Instagram and invited the plebs to have at it.\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail \"My body. My growing baby, open for comments,\" she wrote in the caption. \"Plain as day. I, like every other woman, bracing for your judgments.\" (In an interview with ELLE, King acknowledged that looking too thin while pregnant is not most women's issue.) She's not the only one: Other celebs― ​ Eva Mendes , for instance—have spoken about the scrutiny they felt when they were pregnant. And it doesn't end after delivery: The Internet is full of lists of women who got their bodies \"back\" in record time, as though that's the crowning achievement of postpartum life.\nIt's hard to say when, exactly, the pregnant body—or at least the famous person's pregnant body—became fresh meat. If you track headlines that include the word \"baby bump,\" you'll notice a marked increase in the past five years or so, with a spike just around the time that Prince George and North West were gestating.\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail Or maybe it started earlier than that.\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail Share Tweet Pin E-mail Share Tweet Pin E-mail ", "external_links": ["http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/640x346/1443753359-syn-cos-1443639148-screen-shot-2015-09-30-at-25035-pm.png", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/640x886/1443753360-syn-cos-1443639270-demi.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1443753359-syn-cos-1443639148-screen-shot-2015-09-30-at-25035-pm.png", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/980x1357/1443753360-syn-cos-1443639270-demi.jpg", "http://okmagazine.com/photos/postpartum-weight-loss-pregnant-celebrities-baby-pregnancy-pounds/photo/1001132517/", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/980x1382/1443753364-syn-cos-1443641206-jessicalarge.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1443753360-syn-cos-1443639270-demi.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/480x259/1443753359-syn-cos-1443639148-screen-shot-2015-09-30-at-25035-pm.png", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1443753358-syn-cos-1427076022-rs-600x600-150317110810-600-jaime-king-instagram-copy.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/480x664/1443753360-syn-cos-1443639270-demi.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/480x677/1443753364-syn-cos-1443641206-jessicalarge.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/768x1083/1443753364-syn-cos-1443641206-jessicalarge.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/768x1063/1443753360-syn-cos-1443639270-demi.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/640x902/1443753364-syn-cos-1443641206-jessicalarge.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1443753363-syn-cos-1443639398-cindy-crawford-w-1999.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1443753364-syn-cos-1443641206-jessicalarge.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/768x1013/1443753363-syn-cos-1443639398-cindy-crawford-w-1999.jpg", "http://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/interviews/a27415/jaime-king-on-pregnant-body-image/", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/480x480/1443753358-syn-cos-1427076022-rs-600x600-150317110810-600-jaime-king-instagram-copy.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/480x633/1443753363-syn-cos-1443639398-cindy-crawford-w-1999.jpg", "http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/news/a38384/kim-kardashian-sexy-photos/", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/640x844/1443753363-syn-cos-1443639398-cindy-crawford-w-1999.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/768x415/1443753359-syn-cos-1443639148-screen-shot-2015-09-30-at-25035-pm.png", "http://www.elle.com/fashion/celebrity-style/news/a30598/eva-mendes-on-maternity-style/"], "published": "2015-10-02T06:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:55:59.935+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
