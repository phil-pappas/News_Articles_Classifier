During the proceedings, Gaikwad told the court that he was not willing to undergo brain-mapping because his “mental health” wasn’t good. The lawyer representing the Pansare family said the test can be conducted after his health improved, but Gaikwad remained firm on his stand. As such tests cannot be conducted without the person’s consent, the court rejected police’s application seeking permission for his brain mapping.

Gaikwad, a member of right-wing outfit Sanatan Sanstha, was arrested on September 16 in the case. Pansare, a veteran CPI leader, and his wife were shot by two unidentified motorcycle-borne persons in Kolhapur in February. While his wife survived, Pansare died at a Mumbai hospital. \nModified Date: October 9, 2015 9:01 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:17:09.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
