My mentality is a lot different. I have a lot more confidence in myself and getting myself out of certain situations.\"\nIn Syndergaard's debut, Chris Coghlan went 1-for-2 with a walk and home run, but Cubs manager Joe Maddon wasn't sure he would adjust the lineup to insert Coghlan on Sunday.\n\"I like where (Jorge) Soler is at, but we'll see how it plays out,\" Maddon said.\nThe Cubs also don't have many left-handed hitters off the bench with Miguel Montero expected to catch Jake Arrieta, so Coghlan could be more valuable in that role.\nSyndergaard finished the year 9-7 with a 3.24 ERA and 166 strikeouts in 150 innings. He pitched twice in the division series against the Dodgers, taking a Game 2 loss after allowing three earned runs and striking out nine in 61/3 innings. He also made his first career relief appearance to help the Mets lock down the series, pitching a scoreless seventh with two strikeouts in Game 5.\nThe Mets are cautious about using Syndergaard on Sunday because he warmed up several times before his relief appearance Thursday, but he said he his arm has \"never felt better.\" He also is gaining a better feel for what the playoffs are like.\n\"The anticipation was the game was going to be completely different, but in reality it's still the same game,\" Syndergaard said. \"The only thing that's really different is the crowd's a little bit louder.\"\nAs Arrieta readies for his third playoff start, he also has learned a few things, particularly about conserving his mental energy before games. He said he tries to push his routine back, even just 10 to 15 minutes, to help conserve energy.\n\"You start to get that anxious energy, that excitement,\" Arrieta said. \"Trying to find a way to relax and calm that down before you get to the ballpark (is important) because once your routine starts, it's hard to keep the energy level low.\n\"The physical toll really hasn't bothered me at all, but the mental side of it and all the energy you burn leading up to the game does have a little bit of effect. Having a couple of (playoff starts) under my belt now, I'm pretty confident I'll be able to handle that pretty well.\"\nThe Mets plan to send Jacob deGrom and Steven Matz out for Games 3 and 4 at Wrigley Field.\nckane@tribpub.com\nTwitter @ChiTribKane\nPrivacy Policy Copyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Major League Baseball Chicago Cubs New York Mets Chris Coghlan Jake Arrieta National League Championship Series Joe Maddon", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5622f3c1/turbine/ct-syndergaard-arrieta-cubs-mets-sider-spt-1018-20151017"], "published": "2015-10-18T04:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T06:50:42.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
