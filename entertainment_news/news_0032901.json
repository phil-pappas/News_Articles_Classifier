Barrie’s early 19th century classic “Peter Pan,” about the boy from Neverland who can fly and won’t grow up.\nBasically fan fiction (see also “Elementary,” “50 Shades of Grey”) where beloved characters inhabit new worlds with strikingly different scenarios, “Pan” has the infant Peter abandoned at a London orphanage under the sadistic ministrations of an evil, rations-hoarding Irish nun (Kathy Burke).\nIt’s World War II under Nazi bombings and Peter (Aussie newcomer Levi Miller), a precocious 12-year-old, escapes on a flying pirate ship that dodges British fighter planes before arriving in a lush jungle in Neverland.\nUnder the cruel pirate Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman, virtually unrecognizable), Peter discovers that Lost Boys are forced labor, mining “pixum,” a youth-­regenerating pixie dust.\nEven as Blackbeard boasts, “Children, I have sprung you from life’s cruel dungeon and given you liberty,” he gleefully kills slackers and troublemakers.\nPeter miraculously avoids death and escapes with older prisoner James Hook (Garrett Hedlund), who here has both hands and no hook.\nThis Hook speaks as if he’s channeling John Huston.\nThe contrived, complicated plot sees Peter and Hook align themselves with tribal warrior Tiger Lily (striking Rooney Mara) as they search for the top-secret fairy treasure mountain.\nThe tribe knows their savior will be a boy who can fly, born of a fairy prince and a human woman — is it Peter?\n“Pan” is a long, long, yes, interminable journey until Peter finally gets airborne.\nWhile children may be spellbound by the amazing special effects and outrageous events, lovers of Peter Pan may want to quickly return to the original’s simpler charms.\n(“Pan” has sadistic violence and brutal situations that may disturb the very young.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:36:09.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
