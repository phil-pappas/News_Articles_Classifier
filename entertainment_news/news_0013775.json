It will air at 9:30 p.m. Tuesdays after season-two episodes of “Younger,” the sitcom about a 40-year-old woman posing as 26. \nThe six writers and stars of “Teachers” come from the Katydids, a six-member troupe that got its start at Chicago’s iO Theatre. They made 24 two-minute web episodes of “Teachers,” focusing on the professional and personal foibles of a grade school’s staff, that ended up a calling card for the TV sitcom version. \nOne of the new show’s executive producers is actress Alison Brie of “Community” and “Mad Men” fame, and TV Land said she’ll appear on the pilot episode as an anti-bullying expert. Also set for guest spots: Rob Riggle, Lacey Chabert, Jesse Bradford, Tim Bagley, Sam Richardson and Trevor Larcom.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:39:43.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
