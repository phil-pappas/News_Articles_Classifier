There might not be a better expert than blues singer/guitarist Buddy Guy, who said in a 2011 Dallas Observer interview, “All the blues folks were always playing in barbecue places… I guess it all goes together.” Jeff Ball takes the barbecue-side seriously. At this weekend’s Old Capitol Blues & BBQ festival , he will make sure that 50 competitor/vendors get their cooking right, before handing out awards for who makes the best barbecue. Ball, markets leader for Hanson Professional Services, has been coordinating the judging for this event for a few years now, and makes sure that each judge follows strict Kansas City Barbecue Society (KCBS) regulations. He and his judges are certified by the KCBS to do so. “A few years back, we brought the KC Society to Springfield and they trained some local people. ... We judge on taste, appearance and tenderness.” The rules, Ball noted, are very specific: Each competitor must present an entry in a special container and judges must follow an objective set of rules rather than simply deciding if the attempt “tastes good.” Blues and barbecue festivals happen all over the country and all year, Ball said, but Springfield’s festival is special. “I think we do a better job than bigger events ... especially in the judging,” he said. “Springfield’s is a little more relaxed too (because contestants) are willing to have fun and experiment a bit.” One of the reasons barbecue cooks can relax a bit is because the Old Capitol Blues & BBQ isn’t technically a KCBS-certified event where competitors can collect points for winning and qualify for larger events. KCBS sanctions over 450 barbecue contests worldwide, but Springfield’s still follows KCBS guidelines “strictly,” Ball said. Experienced local professional barbecue master Randy Twyford will be there with his award-winning Twyford BBQ , said Ball. “He does big KC-certified events, but he still comes to ours every year because he enjoys it,” Ball said. “We’re also getting local up-and-comers ... and more creativity.” Bring on the blues It’s not just the barbecue that will bring the crowd, though. Nick Sperry, Downtown Springfield, Inc.’s talent and stage manager, has rounded up two nights of musicians. Sperry, a local-turned-professional blues man who has performed alongside the best of America’s blues talent, said that in his role working for DSI, the event’s host, he’s lined up a mix of “the most popular, most talented and most authentic blues bands” to accompany the barbecue. Page 2 of 3 - Sperry’s picks — local and nationally-renowned musicians — have ties to Springfield, in one way or another. Friday’s headliner, Memphis Beale Street vocalist and blues harmonica player (and founder of blues band Delta Highway), Brandon Santini is a 2014 Blues Music Awards nominee for album “This Time Another Year” (Arden Studios), Male Blues Artist and Live Blues Album for “Live & Extended!” (released in January). Santini is familiar with Springfield as a “once or twice a year” performer at the Alamo and “every now and then” at Third Base Sports Bar. He’s bringing a “very energetic show … with a lot of blues harmonica (and) Delta to heavily-amplified Chicago blues — a melting pot,” he said. Saturday’s headliner is blues “super group” Southern Hospitality (Damon Fowler, Victor Wainwright, J.P. Soars, and Chris Peet). The group is an all-star matchup, said Sperry, “big names in the blues world.” They’ll play Americana, Southern soul, Dixie, jazz, blues, and rock, in the style of Muscle Shoals and Macon. Local flavor On the local side is the Illinois Central Blues Club Challenge, which will start 5 p.m. Friday. The regional blues talent contest will forward winning bands to the International Blues Challenge in Memphis, Tennessee, Jan. 26-30. The Mojo Cats, Shay on SAX featuring the Paper Route Band, and Blues Expressions add to the lineup from the local scene. Challenge winners in 2013, Backpack Jones has a following well beyond their Springfield roots. They competed in the national semi-finals and released their debut album, “Betsy’s Kitchen” in November that year. “We did blues and barbecue a couple of years ago, and we just had a great time,” said Kirk Lonbom, chief information security officer for the state of Illinois. “We’re a band of working guys who came together by accident back in 2012,” he added. The timely attention for their musical storytelling and high-energy performance led by singer/front man “Big Mike” Wallace also landed them a gig as the opening act for B.B. King when he played Springfield in 2013. They aren’t just local talent, Sperry said. They have talent that goes beyond this area and their credits include a run on Illinois roots and blues charts, a nomination for Best New Artist Debut Album by Blues Blast Magazine, and ranking number 15 on the top 20 Most Played Blues Artists by the French Radio Blues Society. Page 3 of 3 - No doubt, the guys who play in the band will enjoy the barbecue, but first, said Lonbom, “Expect a lot of stuff from ‘Betsy’s Kitchen’…and a couple of traditional things.” Ball said and Sperry agreed, that Springfield’s Blues & BBQ is a mix of good food and good music from talented locals and well known out-of-towners. In addition to the food and music, there will be local artists displaying and selling art this year along with free, kid-friendly activities that include a bounce house, magician, juggler, and Lincoln-era games and activities, happening Saturday on the lawn of the Old State Capitol. *** 12th Annual Old Capitol Blues & BBQ When: 5 p.m. to midnight Oct. 2; 3 p.m. to midnight Oct. 3 Where: Fifth and Adams streets, downtown Springfield Admission: $5 adults, free for children 12 and under.
