Well, except for The Half-Blood Prince.Reflecting on the blockbuster franchise, Radcliffe acknowledged that he'd made a mistake in his approach to the sixth Harry Potter film. \"In every movie up to the sixth one, you can see a big step forward in my acting. And then it stopped, or went backward maybe, in the sixth film,\" he admitted to Playboy.The mistake, Radcliffe says, is that he took a wrong-headed approach to Harry's mindset in The Half-Blood Prince.\"I had the idea that Harry was like a soldier traumatised by war, and as a result of that, he shuts down emotionally,\" he recalled.\"That's not a bad idea, but it's not the most interesting thing to watch for two-and-a-half hours. You're watching a mistake you made for 11 months.\" © PA Images This isn't the first time that Radcliffe has spoken negatively about his acting choices on The Half-Blood Prince.\"My acting is very one-note and I can see I got complacent and what I was trying to do just didn't come across… To my knowledge [JK Rowling] was always very happy with the way I played him, but it's my job to be critical,\" he said last year.Radcliffe next stars opposite James McAvoy in the classic horror adaptation Victor Frankenstein, opening on November 25, 2015 in the US and December 3 in the US.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:55:58.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
