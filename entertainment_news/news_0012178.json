Comment By Iris FangerFor The Patriot Ledger Posted Oct. 18, 2015 at 11:52 am Updated at 12:12 PM The legendary Black Mountain College art scene is the subject of a new exhibit at The Institute of Contemporary Art. The show, “Leap Before You Look: Black Mountain College 1933-1957,” is the largest ever exhibition to recall the creatively fertile era when visionary artists such as composer John Cage, modern dance choreographer Merce Cunningham, architect Buckminster Fuller, Bauhaus teacher Josef Albers and his weaver wife Anni, and painter Willem de Kooning, taught and studied at the pioneering college in North Carolina. More than 260 works by 100 artists reveal their impact on art, education and democracy. To walk through the galleries is to marvel at objects that reflect the collaboration between the students and their teachers. The Albers joined the college in 1933. At the time, no one could have predicted that this tiny, underfunded school in the South would become a prime influence on the post-World War II artists who moved the center of the avant garde from Europe to the United States. The school was an artistic mecca until it closed in 1957. “The show was four years in the making,” said assistant curator Ruth Erickson, who organized the exhibition with former chief curator Helen Molesworth. Erickson pointed out that Albers and his wife brought with them from Germany the ideas of “European modernism, to merge with American educator, John Dewey’s mantra of ‘learning by doing’ for a democratic ethos of art making.” At first a liberal arts school, Black Mountain College put the arts at the center of its teaching and learning. Albers had taught at the Bauhaus, the influential German school of art and design, which shut itself down in 1933 rather than accept Nazi faculty. At Black Mountain, Albers brought his basic Bauhaus course, a study of color, with “each color depending on its surrounding environment,” Erickson said. The first gallery in the exhibit presents several of Albers’ abstract paintings of shapes floating in space. His wife, a gifted weaver, who ordered a loom built after she arrived, is represented by several textiles of abstract design, which were later influenced by the couple’s many trips to Mexico. An all-white canvas by one of Albers’ students, the young Robert Rauschenberg, hangs in another gallery, over a “prepared piano,” an invention of John Cage, who came to Black Mountain in 1948. Rauschenberg experimented with the power of black as well, layering it with shadows and suggestions of other hues, as seen in a painting hung further in the show. Like the other students, Rauschenberg also made music and danced with Cunningham, the legendary choreographer who founded his company at Black Mountain in 1953. The art historian, Mary Lynn Kotz observed that Rauschenberg’s “experiences at Black Mountain were central to his development both as an artist and as a major figure in the American avant-garde in the 1950s. It was at Black Mountain that he discovered the themes and techniques that shaped the work he has created since that time.” The exhibit ends with his brightly-colored, three-dimensional collage-sculpture, “Minutiae,” created in 1954 for one of Cunningham’s dances, the first of Rauschenberg’s stage sets. In another gallery, one case displays necklaces made out of bobby pins and corks, testament to the frugality – out of necessity – of the students’ lives, underscored by many fascinating photographs nearby that picture them digging ditches to help construct the buildings, among them two domes by Fuller, the famed architect One of the Fuller domes never stood on its own (to be nicknamed “The Supine Dome”). Works by the poet Charles Olsen, who later lived in Gloucester, are hung at the end, as well as several by poet and potter, M.C. Richards. The calendar for the Black Mountain exhibit is studded with programs recreating various live dance and theater events. The show ends in Boston in late January and then travels to Los Angeles and Columbus, Ohio. In the meantime, the exhibit is a must-see for anyone interested in the importance of the arts in education to develop thinking citizens as well as the progression of arts movements after World War II.
