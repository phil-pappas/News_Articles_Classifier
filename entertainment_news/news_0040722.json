Amber Rose leads SlutWalk protest, breaks down speaking of ex-lovers Kanye West and Wiz Khalifa October 5, 2015 11:03am Choking up ... Amber Rose struggles to hold back tears as she speaks of her exes Kanye West and Wiz Khalifa. Picture: YouTube/Hollywood Fix Sophie Aubrey News Corp Australia Network Share Email a friend \nWARNING: Graphic language \nAMBER Rose was a bundle of emotions when she was joined by hundreds of scantily-clad backers as she led a protest against sexual violence and ‘slut-shaming’. \nThe curvaceous 31-year-old actor and model was all smiles as she led the SlutWalk march in Los Angeles with the support of her mother, waving a sign that read ‘Strippers Have Feelings Too’. \nBut when she opened up onstage about being slut-shamed as a mere 14-year-old and raised her nasty high-profile breakups in front of the crowd of people at the weekend event, she broke down in tears. Proud protester \nIn a clip posted on YouTube , Rose spoke of her emotional pain in the wake of slanderous comments made be her rapper ex-lovers, Kanye West and Wiz Khalifa . \nMost famously, Kanye said in a radio interview he had to take 30 showers after breaking up with Rose before Kim Kardashian would have considered hooking up with him. \nMeanwhile, she was labelled a ‘stripper’ and a ‘ho’ in song For Everybody by Wiz, with whom she has two-year-old son Sebastian. Brimming brigade \n“All I did was ever love him. I just loved him so much and gave him a beautiful son, and to be told that I was nothing but a stripper, it hurt,” Rose confessed between sobs. Gone separate ways ... Amber Rose and ex-husband Wiz Khalifa had been very publicly affectionate in their time together.

I also forgive Wiz for what he said,” she continued, before asking people to also learn to forgive and help others instead of letting anger bubble away inside. \n“I suggest you guys to the same and I’ll tell you why: because ... people are ignorant and you have to be the bigger person and be the positive person to forgive and move on and help other people move on around you.” Bitter ending ... Kanye West and Amber Rose were together for two years, breaking up in 2010. Picture: AP/Peter Kramer Source: Supplied \nHer supercool mum was apparently less forgiving, pictured on Instagram brandishing a sign with the words ‘F--- YO 30 showers!’ in an epic slap-down directed at Kanye. Motherly love \nSlutWalks are part of an international movement , including in Australia , which fights sexist double standards placed on women and the insidious culture of blaming rape victims for their fashion choices. \nRose is increasingly active in the women’s rights movement, having set up a non-profit organisation named the Amber Rose Foundation and a GoFundMe page supporting the cause. \nShe vows that her Los Angeles SlutWalk event will be the first of many.
