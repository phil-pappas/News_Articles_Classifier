Photo: Supplied \nA Royal Night Out (M)\n★★★ \nQueen Elizabeth II recently became Britain's longest-reigning monarch, having been on the throne since February 6, 1952.\nHowever, this film takes as its jumping-off point an incident from earlier in her life and embellishes it considerably. Although the period detail is nicely done, this isn't a history lesson but a lark. If you're willing to go along for the ride, it's a bit of fun.\nOn the evening of May 8, 1945, VE Day, 19-year-old Princess Elizabeth (Sarah Gadon​) and her fun-loving 14-year-old sister, Princess Margaret (Bel Powley​), plead with their parents to be able to go and join the celebrations incognito. Their mother (Emily Watson) isn't keen but their father, King George (Rupert Everett) gives his permission; he's keen to find out what the people think of his midnight speech on the radio. The girls go out with a couple of military chaperones and strict instructions to be back at Buckingham Palace by 1am.\nAdvertisement Of course, things don't go according to plan and what follows is a fairly wild night involving – among other things – dancing, alcohol, nightclubs, brothels and an airman with a bit of a chip on his shoulder (Jack Reynor​).\nWhile it's all pretty far-fetched, the cast is appealing and as an old-fashioned sort of yarn this has its attractions.\nAlso on the Blu-ray are interviews and a making of the film featurette.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:02:32.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
