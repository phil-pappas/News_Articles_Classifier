Three years later, he released his EP, “No. 5 Collaborations Project,” and gained the attention of musical legends Elton John and Jamie Foxx.\nHis first album “+” (“plus”) debuted on top of the UK album charts upon release in Sept. 2011, while his second studio album “X” (multiply) made it to number five on Billboard’s 10 Best Albums of 2014.\nClearly a talented musician with acute sense on what music listeners want, Ed has since received 46 awards and 124 nominations from several international award giving bodies.\nIn 2012, the English singer won the British Breakthrough Act and British Solo Male Artist award in the prestigious BRIT Awards, followed by the Best Male Solo Artist and Album of the Year award for “X” in 2015.\nHe also bagged the Best Male Video for “Sing” featuring Pharrell Williams at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards, and the Favorite Male Artist and Favorite Album for “X” at the 2015 People’s Choice Awards.\nSuch was Ed’s popularity – which came with newfound circle of friends – his collaborations were with high-profile artists including Taylor Swift and One Direction.\n“I don’t think I have much badass in my actual personality. It comes out in terms of playing a record or touring,” he humbly said in a video clip interview furnished to Bulletin Entertainment.\nEd’s concert film debut “Jumpers For Goalposts–The ‘X’ Tour” is coming to selected cinemas worldwide on Oct. 22.\nOn stage at the MTV EMAs\nEd will host the 2015 MTV Europe Music Awards (EMAs) alongside Australian model and former MTV Australia VJ Ruby Rose.\nIt is his second time to be at the EMAs and he could not be any more excited to introduce all the guest celebrities and performers on the show.\n“I find it (MTV EMAs) a lot more interesting than most award shows, not necessarily American shows in general but just because it’s Europe – there’s a bit more music going on than a lot (of) press angle that’s going to make the headlines the next day. There’s just more people playing (music),” he said.\nAsked if he plans to wow the Italian crowd with his hosting skills, he said with good humor, “No one’s going to watch the EMAs and be like, ‘I’m really expecting him to be a good presenter.’ Everyone’s going to watch it and know that it’s going to be an awkward two hours with me kind of fumbling lines, introducing people the wrong way, pronouncing people’s names wrong.”\nBut the singer is up for the challenge; he welcomes the opportunity to impress people by doing something they don’t really expect him to be good at. However, dressing to impress isn’t on his agenda.\nIf last year’s MTV EMA host Nicky Minaj did a lot of outfit changes, Ed will take it down a notch.\n“Choose one outfit and wear it for the night,” he said. “I think I’ll change once when I perform and then change back into what I’m presenting in.”\nThe 2015 MTV EMAs will be held at Mediolanum Forum in Milan, Italy on Oct. 25.\n2015 EMA nominee Martin Garrix and Shay Mitchell of “Pretty Little Liars” will present the awards.\nEllie Goulding, who makes her MTV EMA debut, R&B singer Jason Derulo and duo Twenty One Pilots will appear as guest performers alongside Ed, who will perform with the English drum and bass band Rudimental.\n“It (Rudimental) will be their first time on the MTV EMA stage and my first time with them on TV so it will be cool,” Ed said.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:20:28.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
