The only thing that we could do is try to herd them back. So if we can find them and I have like 10 people to help me herd them back home, then that's the only thing that will work,\" she told KVUE-TV.\nCopyright 2015 by United Press International Share Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1742587", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1742587&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1742587&h=Texas+police+share+video+of+four+escaped+emus"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:21:38.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
