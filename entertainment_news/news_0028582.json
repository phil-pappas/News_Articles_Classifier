They make their decisions more based upon emotions than well-thought-out plans, most of the time.\"\nParents need to have ongoing conversations with teens about what they'd do if offered a ride by a drunk, Turrisi said. These conversations need to be detailed -- asking what other options a kid might take or how they'd talk with their friends about not getting into the car.\nParents should keep in mind that reasons for driving with a drinker might extend beyond peer pressure. For example, a girl might not want to leave her female friend alone with a group of boys who've been drinking, Turrisi said. Or a teen might not want to spend money on a taxi.\nThe fact that nearly all kids are willing to talk about not riding with a drunk driver, and that most aren't worried about damaging their friendships , shows there's an opportunity for peer pressure to work in a beneficial way, he said.\n\"Sometimes one strong voice in the crowd can change things quite a bit,\" Turrisi said.\nParents also can improve their child's willingness to speak up by encouraging him or her to pursue multiple interests, with different groups of friends, Turrisi added.\n\"One of the things kids will be influenced by is the prospect of losing their friends if they don't go along with the crowd,\" Turrisi said. \"If kids have multiple different friends, it's easier for them to resist one group and know that they won't become socially isolated.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:23:35.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
