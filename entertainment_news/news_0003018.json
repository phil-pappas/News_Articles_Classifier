The story follows two orphans who escape their evil stepmother and flee to a forest, where the brother is turned into a deer. \nThe Singing Bones\nShaun Tan\nAllen & Unwin, $35\nSculpted figures evince each tale in The Singing Bones by Shaun Tan. \nReview by Joy Lawn\nAdvertisement Shaun Tan subverts literary illustration, forging new styles and transforming what a book is, where it can transport us and who can read it. Piles of his books, ostensibly for young adults but also for adults, are displayed in bookshops around the world. His picture books span The Arrival , an almost wordless migrant story with surreal elements; Tales from Outer Suburbia , vignettes in words and pictures; and Rules of Summer , a predominantly visual and unnerving exploration of what two boys learnt one summer. \nTan won an Academy Award for his animated short film, The Lost Thing , and has won international and Australian literary awards. One of his early picture books, The Rabbits , with words by John Marsden, is now an opera. Tan's visionary art with its fantastic portrayal of rabbits and marsupials and improbable but authoritative sci-fi elements make the book a contemporary classic.\nHis new book, The Singing Bones , unearths another dimension from much older works, 75 fairytales collected by the Brothers Grimm. His sculpted figures, inspired by ancient carvings and figurines, evince each tale. Many of them are squat and elemental, as though evolved from earth, rock or clay. Many have the pointed or rounded shapes identifiable as his unique style. They are constructed from  papier mache and clay, some with wire, paper, string, nails or gold leaf. The clay has been carved and painted with acrylics, oxidised metal powder and even shoe polish. Some surfaces look bronzed. Other sculptures feature some of Tan's signature colours of red and orange.\nSeeing the sculptures en masse as an exhibition is impressive but belies the formidable impact of the final photographed and edited artwork in the book. \nThe book's composition is quite formal and static. Every tale sits on a double page, with a brief written excerpt from Jack Zipes' version of Grimm' s  Complete Fairy Tales  on each left-hand page. The accompanying sculpture is posed on the right-hand page. \nLight sources are used  skilfully in the book to highlight selected, often textured, surfaces of the figures and to cast shadows. A candle balanced on the figure of The Master Thief innovatively and ironically sheds its own light. Tan as master-designer has control over the direction and distance from which we view the sculptures. This also increases the stasis of the literary form here.\nThe tales don't appear to be in sequential order: the Hans tales are interspersed throughout the book, and familiar stories such as The Worn-Out Dancing Shoes and Thumbling are surrounded by the more obscure The Moon and The Lettuce Donkey .\nSome of the visual highlights are the jaunty stance of The Brave Little Tailor standing on the bulky giant; the leaning, leering witch of Hansel and Gretel ; the curved lines and supple shapes of the kneeling figure in The Water of Life ; and the rounded figure of the prince juxtaposed against the sharper lines and angles of the red fox in The Golden Bird . \nThe dark blacksmith contrasts with the red, twisting devil in mouse form in The Blacksmith and the Devil . The diagonal lines of the symmetrical scissors and elves signify mischief and movement in The Elves ; and the elongated surfaces and strong lines of the red queen in Snow White emanate pride and power. Entrapment is personified in the emerging face of Bearskin and in the elusive All Fur , a girl covered in furs.\nTan urges readers to seek the complete versions of these tales, but many will be content to assume his vision and renderings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T00:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T05:06:18.701+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
