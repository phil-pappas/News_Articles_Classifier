Johnson gives a historical perspective of rural Georgia in the 1940s and ’50s through a look at a boy’s entertainment and play in his new collection of short stories , “ The Bridge at Cromer’s Mill : My Days of Sunshine” (published by Archway Publishing). Growing up in rural Georgia on his grandparents’ farm, Johnson was allowed to roam the fields and streams of the countryside while his mother was away teaching and his father served in World War II. He developed a sense of independence and self-reliance all while enjoying a life of pure Americana – a blend of the 19th and 20th centuries wherein bare feet and sunny days led to exploration and adventure.\nJohnson explores the relationship he had with his grandparents as he illustrates that children can play, be entertained, be creative and have fun without electronic devices.\n“My grandparents influenced me in a very positive manner that I carried with me throughout my life,” Johnson says. “I had a special bond with them; they were an integral part of my early life.”\nThis adventurous, humorous and nostalgic retrospective plays witness to the clashing of a passing age with the introduction of a new time.\n“The Bridge at Cromer’s Mill”\nBy Edmund R.
