Magik audiences see ‘Red’ 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Miniature Curiosa’s “Moon City,” an oddball tale about a dreamer whose attempt to launch an amusement park in a swamp is backed by a well-off alligator, wasn’t necessarily created for a young audience.\nBut plenty of kiddoes have seen it.\n“They’ve been better able explain what happened than the adults,” said Murphi Cook , who makes up one-half of the multimedia visual art/performance company. “So we really trust kids and their ability to understand and appreciate.”\nMore youngsters will be sampling the offbeat sensibilities of Cook and her partner Zach Dorn in the weeks ahead, thanks to their latest project. “Red,” which they created in collaboration with Magik Theatre Artistic Director Dave Morgan , is a fresh take on the story of Little Red Riding Hood.\nMore Information On stage\nWhat: ‘ Red’\nWhere: Magik Theatre, 420 S. Alamo St.\nWhen: Through Nov. 8. Performance times vary.\nTickets: $12-$15 at magiktheatre.org or 210-227-2751.\nIt opens today at Magik.\nThe show will feature Miniature Curiosa’s typical array of striking low-tech visuals, including masks, puppets and shadow puppets. There also will be some new tricks.\n“There’s more interaction with animation,” said Dorn. “We’re trying to push this idea of animation further and incorporate animation with live action.”\nDorn and Cook wrote the script, and Morgan helped develop the whole project. In addition, Magik’s Morgan and Chris Boneta designed the set.\nTheir version of the story emphasizes the coming-of-age aspect of the tale.\n“She turns 13 and her whole life changes,” said Cook, who plays the title role.\nIt also includes a young boy who admires Red’s spirit and imagination. He goes along on the journey with her.\nThe bare bones of the original story, in which Red faces a hungry wolf, are pretty intense.\n“There are certain dark aspects that we like about the (original) story that we keep in there,” said Dorn. “I think there’s an aspect of scariness and horror that I think kids really do enjoy, and I don’t think we go too far. I don’t think it’s as far as the Grimm Brothers version.”\nThat version, one might recall, includes the wolf being gutted by a passing hunter to release Red and her grandmother, and the wolf’s gut then being filled with stones. There’s also an encounter with a second wolf, who ends up drowning.\nCook and Dorn have woven humor throughout their version.\n“I feel like they’ve got a handle on the blend between silly and maybe scary,” said Morgan.\nPreschoolers might not be able to follow the story in “Red.” But Dorn and Cook are confident that children from the first grade up will enjoy it, and that the adults or older siblings who join them at Magik will have a good time, too.\n“I feel like our goal is to get an adult and a 6-year-old and an 8-year-old and a 13-year-old to all enjoy it in the same way,” Dorn said.\ndlmartin@express-news.net\nTwitter: @DeborahMartinEN", "external_links": ["http://www.magiktheatre.org/", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/67/8756704/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/67/8756704/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://www.miniaturecuriosa.com/"], "published": "2015-10-08T16:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:00:17.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
