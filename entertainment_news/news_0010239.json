The estimated recovery time is two months. Recently there was speculation of the possibility that Argentina’s coach Gerardo Martino would include Messi in the team list for the matches against Brazil and Colombia in the South America Zone qualifiers in November. \n“I’m getting better every day without setting myself any targets. I have always said that I would not set a date for my return as it doesn’t depend on me. As much as I would love to play tomorrow, the doctors will not let me,” said Messi. ”Being injured is the worst feeling in the world for a sportsperson,” said Messi but he added that “being 100 percent is the most important thing”. \nAfter losing at home to Ecuador and drawing on their visit to Paraguay in the first two matches on the road to Russia 2018, Argentina will host Brazil in Buenos Aires on November 13 and four days later they will visit Colombia. \n  7:51 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T05:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:11:14.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
