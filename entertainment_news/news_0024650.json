The shop has expanded its menu offerings and will open a downtown location in spring 2016. george morris | gmorris@theadvocate.com Comments \nMagpie Café plans to open a second location in spring of 2016 in a ground-floor space in The Commerce Building located at 333 Laurel St. in downtown Baton Rouge. \nMagpie Café will be the first retail tenant in a building that also will include apartments, the building’s owners announced Wednesday. \nThe restaurant will occupy more than 2,800 square feet and feature a similar menu to Magpie’s Perkins Road overpass. The wellness-centric hot spot opened in 2012 and features house-baked breakfast and lunch options, espresso and coffee. \n“From the initial meeting with Michael Lang and his team [of The Commerce Building], it was evident that the Commerce Building project was a great opportunity to bring the Magpie brand of specialty coffee and local seasonal foods to the resurging downtown area,” James and Lina Jacobs, Magpie Café owners, said in a press release.
