That’s what my break was really about. I could’ve had a stroke.\" Stephanie Marcus Entertainment Editor, Huffington Post Posted: 10/07/2015 11:48 PM EDT | Edited: 26 minutes ago \nNearly two years ago, reports that Selena Gomez was battling lupus first broke . The singer never addressed the claims and her reps wouldn't confirm or deny if Gomez was dealing with health problems. Now, the 23-year-old is speaking about her battle with the autoimmune disease for the first time. “I was diagnosed with lupus, and I’ve been through chemotherapy. That’s what my break was really about. I could’ve had a stroke,\" Gomez told Billboard magazine referring to a period in late 2013 and early 2014 when the singer suddenly canceled the Asian and Australian leg of her Stars Dance tour and prompted rumors she was dealing with an addiction. It wasn't long after that reports Gomez had entered rehab emerged. Her rep at the time confirmed that the singer sought treatment at Dawn at The Meadows recovery facility in Wickenburg, Ariz., for \"emotional issues\" and \"partying,\" but specified she wasn't seeking treatment for substance abuse. So while Gomez did stay in rehab for two weeks in February 2014, at some point she apparently also underwent chemotherapy to treat her lupus.. “I wanted so badly to say, ‘You guys have no idea. I’m in chemotherapy. You’re assholes.' I locked myself away until I was confident and comfortable again,\" she told Billboard. At the time, TMZ' claimed that she left rehab just 14 days into a six-week program , despite objections from the center's staff. The website also reported that Gomez left the center with promises to return after she had finished promoting her movie, \"Rudderless,\" at the Sundance Film Festival, but ultimately decided she had already managed to address her issues. While the singer didn't elaborate on the current status of her health, she did open up to Us Weekly about the state of her mental health. \"This was the first year I ever dealt with anyone talking about my body,\" Gomez told the magazine. \"I'd land at the airport and people would yell out, 'You're fat!' It was awful. I've been working in therapy. Even if I did gain weight, I'm fine.\" Talking it out seems to be beneficial for the \"Good For You\" singer, who also revealed it was negative comments from body-shamers that inspired her to pose nude on the cover of new album \"Revival.\" Sep 8, 2015 at 1:00pm PDT Also on HuffPost:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:22:44.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
