Madame Masque and her husband respectively. \n\" Marvel's Agent Carter \" is adding four actors as new regulars for season 2. Those who have landed juicy roles on the ABC series are Lotte Verbeek, Wynn Everett, Currie Graham as well as Reggie Austin. Verbeek (\" Outlander \") is cast as Edwin Jarvis' ( James D'Arcy ) free-spirited wife, Anna. \"For a character fans love as much as Jarvis, we had to find him a partner who would be equally beloved,\" Marvel's Jeph Loeb says of the casting. \"Lotte brings ease, sincerity and warmth to the role that's just perfect.\" Everett (\" The Newsroom \") will play Whitney Frost, a Hollywood actress and brilliant inventor. In the comics, she first appeared in \"Tales of Suspense\" #98 before becoming Madame Masque a year later in \"Iron Man\" #17. Executive producers Tara Butters, Michele Fazekas and Chris Dingess explain, \"Whitney Frost is a character with a storied history in the Marvel comics, and we're excited to get the opportunity to introduce her to fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Inspired by Hollywood icons like Hedy Lamarr and Lauren Bacall , we knew we needed an actor who was classically glamorous and fiercely intelligent. Wynn is both, and we're thrilled to watch her bring this formidable character to life.\" Frost will be accompanied by her husband, Calvin Chadwick, who will be portrayed by Graham (\" Raising the Bar \"). Chadwick is described as a high-powered businessman. \"We knew we needed an actor versatile enough to go head-to-head with both Hayley and Wynn, and Currie Graham is one of those actors who can truly do anything,\" the executive producers gush about Graham. \"He brings a grounded, human quality to Calvin Chadwick, a complex character who lives at the center of season 2's intrigue.\" Last but not least, Austin (\" Devious Maids \") will play Jason Wilkes, a quirky, yet charismatic scientist who instantly charms Peggy ( Hayley Atwell ) and may or may not become a love interest for her. Loeb says of Wilkes, \"We were impressed by Reggie as soon as we met with him. He has a unique ability to be handsome and charming while also being extremely accessible. We knew he could portray a character whom both audiences and Peggy would love.\" At the New York Comic Con on Friday, October 9, Fazekas said the second season would be set in 1947, six months after events in the first season finale. \"Things are different,\" she revealed. \"We'll see people are in different positions. Not everyone is in New York anymore. There's some history we're not quite sure of. Some people are not talking to each other anymore.\" Among the changes, Daniel Sousa (Enver Gjokaj) will become the new chief in Los Angeles following the death of Roger Dooley ( Shea Whigham ). Jack Thompson ( Chad Michael Murray ) will take over SSR New York, but as Fazekas noted last July, \"he's also not the head of the whole agency.\" \"Marvel's Agent Carter\" returns with the new season in midseason 2016. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T05:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:10:50.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
