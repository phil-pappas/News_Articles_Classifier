It’s a war movie, set in Africa, and tells the story of a child soldier and how he goes, in a matter of months, from happy innocence, surrounded by family, to hacking a guy’s brains out with a sword.\nDirected by Cary Joji Fukunaga , the film is a risky but ambitious first entry for Netflix, as it enters the theatrical movie business. The film is available for streaming starting Thursday at midnight and opens hours later in theaters Friday. It is, at times, not the easiest film to watch, but it’s artfully made and will leave audiences feeling like their world has expanded.\nMore Information Beasts of No Nation\n★★★\nQuick take: Talk about a loss of innocence …\nIt’s not a TV movie, nor does it look like one. It can be enjoyed on a TV, preferably a big one, but the film will be best experienced in a theater. The introduction of Idris Elba , as the commandant, is very much a movie entrance. People scatter and we see him in the foreground moving toward the camera, this magnificent figure, this charismatic natural leader, who is also a sadistic monster.\nBased on a novel by Uzodinma Iweala, “Beasts of No Nation” is set in an unnamed African country where the earth has a reddish tinge. The color becomes a running motif, with puddles of rain water that somehow resemble blood, and with the surrounding world turning red during battle scenes. When the little boy, Agu ( Abraham Attah ), commits his first murder, the splatter hits the camera lens.\nA civil war is on, but as the film begins, nothing has intruded yet on a childhood that looks almost idyllic, despite the relative poverty. Agu is a bright, imaginative kid, with lots of friends and a big, loving family, and for now, it looks as though Agu’s part of the country is protected. And then it’s not.\nThere are harrowing scenes here that are the stuff of nightmares, as when people huddle inside a small hut trying to decide whether to make a run for it (and probably get killed by government marauders) or wait inside and get captured. By the time Agu sees the powerful commandant coming toward him, he has already twice survived almost certain death. He is scarred in ways that are beyond imagining, and the horrors have barely started.\nThe film shows the ways in which an adult military leader can worm his way into the minds of lost children, by pretending to be their father and protector. But the movie avoids all the expected cliches: The commandant doesn’t have a soft side, and Agu always fears him and never loves him.\nAgu is hardened, not by any resolve to do his master’s bidding, but by the sheer repetition of atrocities around him. He gets the point that a murder in the background can’t distract him from a joke in the foreground. It takes the spectacle of boys stomping a little girl to death for him to even register a response.\nYoung Abraham Attah renders the subtleties of Agu’s psychology with a precocious insight that’s at least partly his own, though when a child actor is this brilliant one must look to the director, as well. Perhaps Attah also benefited from the acting lesson afforded by working with Elba, who makes the remarkable choice of not playing the commandant as an evil or twisted man. No, as played by Elba, the commandant is so far gone in his evil twistedness that he believes himself to be great, and he carries himself with that kind of authority.\nFukunaga directs with a gracefulness that’s perhaps not merely welcome, but necessary. The world here is so ugly that only beautiful tracking shots, rich close-ups and adroit hand-held work could make it bearable.\nRunning time: 137 minutes\nMPAA rating: None (graphic violence)", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/67/8793593/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/67/8793590/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/67/8793592/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/67/8793589/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/67/8793590/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/67/8793593/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/67/8793592/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/67/8793589/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/67/8793588/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/67/8793591/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/67/8793594/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/67/8793591/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/67/8793588/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/67/8793594/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T13:46:36.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
