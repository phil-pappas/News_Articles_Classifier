The actors in the “official” series run from the gritty original, Scottish star Sean Connery, through self-important Australian George Lazenby, suave if lightweight Englishman Roger Moore, sombre Welshman Timothy Dalton, sly Irish-American Pierce Brosnan and the current Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig.\nCraig brought back the grit without the misogyny of Connery’s womanizing character. The outliers are Englishman David Niven, who suffered through the parody version of Casino Royale in 1967; and American Barry Nelson, a chubby-cheeked nonentity who played Jimmy Bond in the clunky 1954 CBS-TV version of the same Ian Fleming novel.\nRemarkably, after all action and controversy and numerous lawsuits involving Fleming, his estate and various film producers, the anticipation for Spectre is off the charts as we get ready for the 24th “official” Bond to open Nov. 6. Sam Mendes returns as the 007 director, after scoring a triumph with the thrilling Skyfall in 2012 (which ranks as the highest grossing Bond title with $1.1 billion in worldwide box office).\nCraig, the Bond who cares not at all whether his martinis are shaken or stirred, tackles the role for the fourth and perhaps final time. His Spectre co-stars include Christoph Waltz as the villain Franz Oberhauser, Ralph Fiennes as M, Naomie Harris in her Eve Moneypenny reprise, and both Lea Seydoux and Monica Bellucci as the latest Bond Girls.\nIn honour of Spectre — and the expectations surrounding it — we rank all the 007 movies. This includes all 23 “official” Bonds from Eon Productions. This is the production house launched in 1961 by American producer Albert (Cubby) Broccoli and Canadian producer Harry Saltzman. With the co-founders gone, Eon is now in the hands of Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson.\nIn addition, two rogue productions — Casino Royale of 1967 and the Thunderball remake Never Say Never Again from 1983 — are thrown into the mix. The TV version of Casino Royale is not included here. Oddly, we ended up with the same title on the top and at the bottom of the list. There a cinematic abyss between the brilliant 2006 film version of Casino Royale and that dreadful 1967 parody.\nTHE TOP 10 JAMES BONDS\n1 — Casino Royale (2006): Director Martin Campbell, who introduced us to Brosnan as Bond in GoldenEye, did the same with Craig in this stunner. Not only does it serve some of Fleming’s original interests, the superbly made movie gives us an angry, moody Bond who can handle action and even romantic emotion. Eva Green is his doomed Bond Girl while Mads Mikkelsen is terrific at the card table as Le Chiffre.\n2 — Goldfinger (1964): With Connery as his anti-heroic Bond, Guy Hamilton perfected the template for the early years of the franchise in this action thriller. Gert Frobe’s Auric Goldfinger is a classic villain, with Harold Sakata as his lethal sidekick Oddjob. And no one can forget Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore!\n3 — Dr. No (1962): Connery, who was not the producers’ first choice as Bond but was certainly the best one at the time, launched the franchise in spectacular fashion. Even if Terence Young’s movie was done on the cheap. Ursula Andress made men weak in the knees as Honey Ryder.\n4 — Skyfall (2012): After Craig’s Quantum of Solace perplexed some fans and pissed off many critics, Sam Mendes got things back on track with an amazing effort featuring Javier Bardem as the villain and Judi Dench in her farewell appearance as M. The plot is fascinating for its personal connections involving 007, M and their enemies.\n5 — On Her Majesty’s Secret Service (1969): Despite a ridiculous promotional campaign — “Far Up! Far Out! Far More! James Bond 007 is back!” — this one-off starring Lazenby has grown in stature over the decades. It hurts not at all that it co-stars Diana Rigg (fresh from playing Emma Peel in The Avengers TV series). Plus Lazenby’s ski chase in the Alps is fantastic.\n6 — From Russia with Love (1964): Young and Connery team up a second time for a gritty and violent and thrilling Bond. This one is often cited as most faithful to novelist Fleming’s original vision for a spy he deliberately named so blandly after a real-life British ornithologist. SPECTRE is behind the villainy — and that is the super-secret organization Craig is tracking in the new Bond.\n7 — GoldenEye (1995): Not everyone loves Brosnan’s Bond but his first outing is still engaging. Director Campbell has quickens the pulse of 007 and Brosnan effectively revives the iconic character after a six-year hiatus. The support cast is superb, with Sean Bean and Famke Janssen in key roles and classy Dench in her M debut.\n8 — Thunderball (1965): Young directs Bond for the final time, giving Connery a great setting — the Bahamas — a beautiful Bond Girl — Claudine Auger — and a villain with an eye-patch — Adolfo Celi. Critically, Connery is still fully engaged as 007.\n9 — The Spy Who Loved Me (1977): Moore’s finest outing as 007 includes a spectacular ski stunt, a Bond Girl in Barbara Bach who later married ex-Beatle Ringo Starr, and our first meeting with Richard Kiel and his mouth-of-steel as Jaws.\n10 — The Living Daylights (1987): Millions of Bond fans are down on the serious-minded Dalton, but he brought dignity and gravitas back to the role. If you leap over the Brosnan era, you can see some of it layered into Craig’s performances. With John Glen as director, Dalton’s Bond travelled the world.\nRANKING THE REST OF THE BONDS:\n11 — You Only Live Twice (1967): Connery teams with ninjas to fight SPECTRE’s dastardly deeds in the U.S./U.S.S.R. space race.\n12 — Live and Let Die (1973): Moore (The Saint) takes over as Bond after Connery’s second exit. He indulges in some Blaxploitation action, a signpost of the times, as is Paul McCartney’s dynamic title song.\n13 — Die Another Day (2002): Millions of men died a little when they saw Halle Berry channel her outer Ursula Andress in a bikini. This action-packed, stunt-filled movie is Brosnan’s final Bond.\n14 — Quantum of Solace (2008): Craig’s second Bond has its haters, but the venom is misplaced. The water rights plot is actually worthy, even if 007’s revenge subplot is too convoluted.\n15 — The Man with the Golden Gun (1974): Moore’s Bond was now skewing towards light comedy instead of killer cool. But this one has Christopher Lee and Herve Villechaize as the fabulous villains, Scaramanga and Nick Nack.\n16 — For Your Eyes Only (1981): After the outlandish Moonraker, a return to Planet Earth and more traditional Bond plot was welcome, even if Moore was aging.\n17 — Never Say Never Again (1983): Actually, just the opposite — because Connery should have never said yes to a rogue remake of Thunderball just to make the big money he thought he was due from the “official” franchise.\n18 — Tomorrow Never Dies (1997): Brosnan is slick and sleek as he tackles villainous media mogul Jonathan Pryce, but the trumped-up plot is lame.\n19 — Diamonds are Forever (1971): Connery returns to the role after missing On Her Majesty’s Secret Service. He earned a bigger paycheque but obviously had no real zeal.\n20 — A View to a Kill (1985): Moore delves into a horse-racing gambit that turns into a Silicon Valley crisis — and his time as 007 is thankfully over.\n21 — Octopussy (1983): I was on set and had a blast, including in my Moore interview. But the movie itself, with its jewel-smuggling/nuclear bomb plot and Moore dressing in a clown costume, did not age well.\n22 — The World is Not Enough (1999): Actually, it was plenty enough, although Brosnan would die another day as Bond. Denise Richards plays a physicist. Huh?\n23 — Licence to Kill (1989): Dalton’s licence is revoked: too dull, too dreary, despite re-inventing the role after Moore. No more Bonds for another six years!\n24 — Moonraker (1979): Moore’s Bond blasts off into outer space, making this the worst entry in the franchise’s “gimmicks era.”\n25 — Casino Royale (1967): With multiple directors and too much confusion around Niven’s 007, this spoofy comedy just went goofy.\nTwitter: @Bruce_Kirkland\nbruce.kirkland@sunmedia.ca\nPoll The best James Bond film is...
