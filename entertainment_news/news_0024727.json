The money would be better spent on maintaining the nearly undriveable streets.”\n“How can they say there is no cost of living increase when Medicare rates have been raised? Senior citizens spend more on medicine than gasoline.”\n“Sandfly really needs a grocery store!”\n“This morning I stopped children walking to the bus from opening my mailbox and other mailboxes. Parents, please explain to your children that this is wrong and against the law!”\n“Crime is out of control in Savannah. We need a new mayor, city council and police chief.”\nContribute to Vox Populi by calling 912-525-0VOX (0869) or emailing us at vox@savannahnow.com . Be sure to write Vox Populi in the subject field.
