I don't care who was sick in #OneDirection Direction. Rest of them should have had the decency & maturity to appear on stage and explain. \n— Eamonn Holmes (@EamonnHolmes) October 20, 2015 Eamonn Holmes (Anthony Devlin/PA) \nLiam’s illness is apparently not serious, but also caused him to miss the Attitude Magazine Awards earlier in the week. \nIrish radio and TV presenter Stephen Nolan tweeted that he’d been told it was actually Niall Horan who was sick – exasperating Eamonn, who questioned the band’s story. So are they all sick ? At least they should get their story straight. https://t.co/YfPcL8LXgL \n— Eamonn Holmes (@EamonnHolmes) October 20, 2015 \nThe morning TV presenter received lots of tweets expressing agreement – but he also managed to invoke the wrath of 1D’s loyal Twitter followers. @EamonnHolmes who tf are you? just stay in your lane nobody asked you anything and nobody cares what u think \n— Andreea A (@Andreea_Horan15) October 20, 2015 @EamonnHolmes if you saw the screens and heard what was said, it will be explained, you have no idea what's happened don't point fingers", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T11:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:45:43.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
