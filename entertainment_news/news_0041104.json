I’ll be brief about the movie. Artfully directed by Bill Pohland, the film proceeds in a nonlinear manner. Two actors, Paul Dano (1960s) and John Cusack (1980s), play Brian Wilson, the innovator of the Beach Boys. A sinister doctor played by Paul Giamatti oversees — to a fault — Wilson’s slide into psychosis. Dano looks like Brian Wilson, Cusack does not. Knowing that, here is why you should see “Love & Mercy”: Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys were a seminal part of a musical sea change that led to a cultural revolution. Their recordings, along with those of The Beatles, Bob Dylan, the Mamas & the Papas, the Birds, etc., changed music forever. Goodbye, Bobby Rydell, Paul Anka and the other boys. Happily, the film emphasizes Wilson’s innovative recording methods and his visionary musicianship. Plenty of time is spent on the creation of the album “Pet Sounds,” which Rolling Stone lists as the second best album of all time — second to “Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.” Even if you weren’t around in the ’60s, you undoubtedly heard their music in utero. There was no escaping “Surfer Girl” et al. If you were, like me, a swaying bobble head in the ’60s, enchanted by a musical tsunami encircling the world, you owe it to yourself to come see Wilson’s story. Join us Saturday night for “Love & Mercy,” a well-done, unsympathetic look at a creative genius. The movie starts at 7:30 p.m. but the acoustic duo Junkyard Heartstrings is opening the evening with music at 6:45 p.m. See you there. It’s gonna be “Fun Fun Fun.” If you go What: “Love & Mercy,” rated PG-13 When: 7:30 p.m. Saturday Where: Donald L. Oat Theater, 60 Broadway, Norwich Suggested donation: $7 By Sue Masse For The Bulletin The Bulletin By Sue Masse For The Bulletin Posted Oct. 7, 2015 at 6:01 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:38:09.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
