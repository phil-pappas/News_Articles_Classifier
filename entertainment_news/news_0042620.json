As he told ABC Radio, \"I'm not that into apps, I use my phone for Twitter or s*** like that.\" \nHe adds, \"I'm not looking for more reasons to be on my phone or computer.\" \nIn fact, Steve Jobs wasn't even really on Rogen's radar before he joined the cast of the movie. He admits, \"I knew nothing about him before the movie. I was not particularly interested in him before the movie.\" \nSteve Jobs is in select theaters now, and is everywhere next week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:19:13.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
