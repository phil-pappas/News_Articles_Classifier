The comedienne, who was on the comedy line-up at the event, unexpectedly took the stage with the \"School of Rock\" actor to perform a Bette Midler classic. Clad in bohemian outfit and completing her look with sunglasses, Poehler handled the lead vocal duties as she covered \"The Rose\" with a pianist and Black backing her. Meanwhile, the crowd cheered her on throughout the song. Poehler has openly been a fan of Midler. During her appearance at New York Restoration Project's 13th Annual Spring Picnic last year, the former \" Parks and Recreation \" star said in a speech, \"So I first met Bette Midler in my head when I watched the film 'The Rose' in 1979. And since then, her and I have been best friends, in my head.\" \"In my head, she and I travel together, we have cut an album, and we pranked George Clooney ,\" she continued. \"She's the godmother to the children of mine that she has never met, and once, Bette turned to me in a dream and said, 'Amy, you are the most talented person I've ever met. I hate to say this, this kills me, but you're more talented than me. God bless you and I release you to God,' and then she turned into a million doves and flew away.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T11:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:41:31.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
