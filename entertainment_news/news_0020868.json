While we can bank on the appearance being predictably unpredictable – I mean, just look at what she's wearing in her promo videos – there are a few things we can definitely count on from the show. And since there is no better way to watch SNL than with discount red wine, we've created a drinking game companion that guarantees Saturday's jokes will be even funnier. First rule: drink responsibly! As for the others: Take a sip every time Vanessa Bayer impersonates Miley. This is the only thing we have ever known to be inevitable and true – Bayer's old-school Miley impression is happening on Saturday. It must, we say! It must! Take a sip every time Miley's tongue is not in its proper place.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T22:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:46:01.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
