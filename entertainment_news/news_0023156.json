This contest is easy, simply enter to win. No purchase is necessary. \nPrototypes are essential in the invention process. This is where ideas are tested and designs are refined. There are several types of prototypes. The presentation prototype is one of the first and most important types of prototypes that most inventors need, because it allows the inventor to refine designs and to seek out investors or licensing agreements. \n\"Every inventor needs to develop prototypes early on in the process,\" said Scott J. Cooper, CEO and Creative Director of World Patent Marketing and Desa Industries, Inc . \"There are four kinds of prototypes, each of them are important at different stages in the invention process. We begin with the Presentation Prototype, which is a physical model that \"looks\" like the invention but doesn't have to work. \n\"The Proof of Concept Prototype is the flipside of the Presentation, in that it doesn't have to look anything like the finished product, but it has to work. For example, if your idea is an electronic device that will finally be sold inside of a slick casing, the Proof-of-concept be made up of a bunch of wires, connectors, and clips. The point is to show that the idea works. \n\"Then when we are ready to go into production we develop a Functional Prototype and a Production Prototype. The Functional Prototype will look and work exactly like you finished product. The difference is that it is made more or less custom, in small volume runs. You need this to make final changes and approvals as well as to show to buyers and investors. The Production Prototype is made to test and approve the actual manufacturing techniques. \n\"Every one of these is important. And this is a chance for one of our inventors to win a prototype that is essential to their invention's success.\" \nABOUT WORLD PATENT MARKETING \nWorld Patent Marketing is an innovation incubator and manufacturer of patented products for inventors and entrepreneurs.
