The two sides will be coming into the 50-over series at the back of a 2-0 finish in favour of the visitors in the three-match Twenty20 International series. Here are five players to watch out for in the first ODI between India and South Africa: 1) MS Dhoni : The Indian skipper is under a lot of pressure following a poor individual and team show in the recently-concluded T20 International series. He has managed to put down questions and doubts over his future with his sense of humour. But words can’t talk for long and the Indian skipper would like to make a statement with his bat. Against Bangladesh, he was seen batting at Number Four. It will be interesting to see if he continues to bat higher up the order against South Africa as well. 2) Ravichandran Ashwin : The Chennai off-spinner has been in the form of his life for the last few months and has been the only Indian bowler to have caused any sort of trouble to the South African batsmen in the T20 International series. Even as the pitch at Green Park isn’t as spinner-friendly as some of the other grounds in the country, he will continue to be a crucial player for India’s chances at Kanpur. 3) Rohit Sharma : The Hitman from Mumbai did make a strong statement rubbishing all talks of ‘talent’ just before the start of the T20 series. However, soon enough he gave an account contradicting his statement with a century of sheer class. 4) South Africa’s fielding: Not just with the bat and ball, South Africa have also outshined India on the field. Despite the wet outfield which resulted in a lot of fielders slipping, the visitors put up a superb show on the field. The effected numerous run-outs which turned the course of the match in their favour every time. Irrespective of how they bat or bowl in the ODIs, their fielding will continue to hold them in good stead. 5) Imran Tahir : The South African leg-spinner will be the key bowler for the visitors in the ODI series. Despite the likes of Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel coming back to the side, Tahir will have to play an important role in conditions which is unlikely to aid the pacers. India ODI Squad: MS Dhoni (C), Virat Kohli (VC), Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Suresh Raina, Ajinkya Rahane, Ambati Rayudu, Stuart Binny, Gurkeerat Singh Mann, Axar Patel, R Ashwin, Amit Mishra, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohit Sharma, Umesh Yadav. South Africa ODI Squad: AB De Villiers (C), Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock, Faf Du Plessis, JP Duminy, David Miller, Farhaan Behardien, Chris Morris, Khaya Zondo, Aaron Phangiso, Imran Tahir, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Kyle Abbott, Kagiso Rabada. \n  9, 2015 5:49 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:21:20.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
