Jeb Bush shouldn't be running the country if he can't even run his own campaign. \nTrump was in Jacksonville on Saturday, the day after the Bush campaign announced staff trims and 40 percent pay cuts for those who remain. He said Bush, the son and brother of former presidents, is embarrassing his family. \nTrump said he's only spent a couple of million dollars on his campaign and is leading in the polls. He said spending less and getting more is what the country should be doing. \nThousands of raucous supporters cheered Trump in Bush's home state during a riverfront rally. Trump also made fun of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio , saying he's out of money and \"sweating like a dog.\" Copyright The Associated Press Sign up for our WPXI-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter Sign Up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T22:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:54:47.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
