The Philadelphia-based company said the move would also improve the trading liquidity of its publicly traded stock. \nComcast plans to hold a special meeting of its shareholders to vote on the reclassification. Shareholders of record on Oct. 20 are entitled to vote at the special meeting. \nShares of Comcast rose 16 cents to $62.14 in morning trading. Rate this This article has not yet been rated.
