An outdoor table above the ship’s fantail. A hot sun tempers the cool breezes of early evening and turns the ship’s wake into a molten silver stream touching the pink-and-red sunset. Dark waters ripple as far as the eye can see.\nThe Caribbean? The Mediterranean? Not exactly. We were on Lake Erie, believe it or not, midway through Haimark Travel’s luxury Great Lakes cruise aboard the Saint Laurent. The 210-passenger, small-ship cruiser offers summer trips with boarding and disembarkation points in Chicago, Toronto and Montreal.\nThere is much that’s unexpected on a cruise of the Great Lakes (in our case, some of it unexpectedly frustrating, but we’ll get to that). Millions of people, after all, live near the shores of these massive inland oceans but typically get only a glimpse from a beach or a waterfront, if that.\nAs maritime historian Fred Stonehouse said, “The Great Lakes are among the best and most unexplored cruising grounds in the world.”\nOur cruise on the Saint Laurent was to sail from Chicago on an evening in mid-July. But a few weeks before, sailing another itinerary, the ship hit a concrete abutment in the St. Lawrence Seaway, injuring more than 20 passengers and crew and requiring several days of repairs.\nHaimark canceled one subsequent sailing and informed us a few days before we were to depart that we would be bused from Chicago to Mackinac Island, at the northern tip of Michigan, to meet the boat. As it turned out, the Saint Laurent didn’t make that connection, either. There was another night in a hotel and one more buffet dinner, at which Haimark announced it was chartering a plane to fly us to connect with the ship in Detroit. About a dozen people opted to drop out and fly home from Detroit.\nFor those who stayed, there were partial cash refunds, generous discounts for future cruises and money to spend on board — and six days of living it up on the Saint Laurent.\nBefore setting sail from Detroit, we visited the nearby Henry Ford Museum, an immense trove of American artifacts with a focus on history and technology. Then, finally cruising, we settled into a routine of eating, drinking and shore excursions while traveling from Lake Huron through the Georgian Bay (sometimes considered the sixth Great Lake), on to Lakes Erie and Ontario and finally the St. Lawrence Seaway and Montreal.\nA brief stop at Manitoulin Island, in Lake Huron, was a highlight. At a First Nations settlement, enthusiastic young people in tribal costume gave a spirited dance performance, and we toured a gallery of Native American art. Niagara Falls was a “wow” moment, particularly for first-timers, and was paired with a winery tour in nearby Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario. (Rest assured that our ship bypassed Niagara Falls in favor of the nearby Welland Canal!) We disembarked at Montreal, near the historic old city.\nAboard ship, the open top deck offered a panorama of lakes and shore and the cool lake breezes that are familiar to those of us who live nearby. Non-Midwesterners were surprised at the deep blue of the water, likening it to the Caribbean.\nOur cabin was tight but comfortable and functional, with a full bathroom, large closet and much-appreciated under-bed storage. Small ships like this don’t offer the extravagantly large rooms found (for a price) aboard the mega-ships that host thousands. But that also means you’re not elbow to elbow with that cast of thousands for every meal and activity.\nOur favorite onboard dining spot was the Cliff Rock Bar & Grille. At first we were drawn by the open-air seating, but soon “warmed” to its unusual tabletop grilling scheme. Diners select from beef or fish options that are brought to the table raw, atop a small square of rock heated to 860 degrees. Use that hot rock to grill your food, and every forkful can be done just as you like it.\nSome of my favorite times, though, were spent on deck, sipping coffee in the morning or a gin and tonic in the afternoon as we sailed Lakes Huron and Erie, then passed through the Thousand Islands archipelago at the mouth of the St. Lawrence, at the east end of Lake Ontario. Watching birds slowly cross the emerging brilliance of sunset was an active meditation, calming and energizing at the same time.\nI’m a Midwesterner and a Great Lakes lover, but this experience gave me a new pride at the beauty and legacy of this immense natural resource. There were few Midwesterners aboard. Instead, passengers came from California, Connecticut, Florida, Kentucky, New York, Texas and Washington state, among other places. Haimark managing partner Tom Markwell says the Great Lakes cruises have been popular with French and German tourists as well.\nIf you go ...\nFor summer 2016, Haimark Travel offers two 10-day sailings for the Chicago-­Montreal route, one from each city, and starting at $4,499 per person, as well as two 10-day sailings from Toronto to Chicago, at similar prices. Air travel is not included. The company also offers pre- and post-cruise tours (855-424-6275, haimark line.com). Three other companies plying the lakes are Blount Small Ships Adventures, Pearl River Cruises and Plantours (of Hamburg, Germany).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:44:22.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
