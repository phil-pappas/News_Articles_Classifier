But my Father in Law was the kind of man that radiated pure joy and it was infectious. He loved and adored his family more than anything. He was a jokester, a great dancer, a crier (especially when he was talking about his sons), and he lived his life in the present, appreciating each moment as a huge blessing. He was my husbands hero and like my second Dad.\"\nShe wrote of her brother-in-law, \"My brother in law was such a hard working business owner. He was an incredible salsa dancer, he was fluent in Japanese and we all looked up to him. When things became dangerous in Tampico a few years ago he moved his family to Estonia, Guadalajara, and then Mcallen Texas just to keep them safe. He was a wonderful friend, an amazing husband, and a great father to his two beautiful children.\"\nLandry's in-laws were found dead Sept. 19 in Mexico. They were held hostage for a little more than two weeks after they were kidnapped outside their home Sept. 4 and held for ransom. A ransom was reportedly paid, but the kidnappers killed the victims.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:53:33.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
