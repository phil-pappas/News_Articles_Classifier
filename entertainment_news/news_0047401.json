Moore's films have been among the most lucrative documentaries at the box office. His \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" earned $119.2 million in 2004; his last film, 2009's \"Capitalism: A Love Story,\" made $14.4 million. \n\"Where to Invade Next\" will be the first film from a not-yet-named distribution label formed by Alamo Drafthouse founder Tim League and former Radius founders Tom Quinn and Jason Janego. Moore called them \"a cinematic Dream Team.\" \nA limited, Oscar-qualifying theatrical release is planned for December.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T21:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T05:10:31.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
