Stine"], "text": "Our scariest moments in pop culture \nAmerican author R.L. Stine has been scaring kids and teens for decades, in particular with the Goosebumps books that turned Stine into one of the world’s bestselling novelists. After two decades of false starts, including one involving Tim Burton, Hollywood has finally turned the Stine phenomenon into a movie. \nGoosebumps opens wide on Friday. Jack Black plays a fictional version of Stine in what director Rob Letterman (Monsters vs. Aliens) has made into a multi-genre horror movie, fantasy, comedy and teen romance. The movie’s scary moments mirror those in the Goosebumps books. \n“Why do they like it so much?” Stine asks about why children like to be scared. “I don’t know.” But he does have theories, as he explains on a Toronto visit. The 72-year-old Stine, who prefers to be called Bob, sits with three of the teens who co-star with Black: Odeya Rush, who plays Stine’s daughter; Dylan Minnette, the new boy next door; and Ryan Lee, comic sidekick to Minnette’s character as the two unravel the mystery of the neighbours. \n“I was totally shocked because I just wrote funny books, joke books,” the real Stine says of the impact his first horror novels had. Stine made his transition with the Fear Street series, starting with The New Girl in 1989. The series sold more than 80 million copies worldwide. The first Goosebumps novel, Welcome to Dead House, arrived in July of 1992. Since then, dozens of Goosebumps books have sold more than 350 million copies to younger readers. \nStine explains: “I used to go to schools and ask: ‘Why do you like these books?’ Every single time the kid would say: ‘I like to be scared!’ I thought about it a lot and now I think we all like to be scared, if we know we’re also safe at the same time. Kids can have these adventures, and have these creepy things happen to them, and know that they’re safe in their rooms reading.” \nIn Goosebumps the movie, scary characters from Stine’s books escape the page, come alive in the flesh and terrorize a small American town where Black’s version of Stine lives as a recluse with his daughter. \nBlack’s portrayal of him is entirely fictional, Stine says, while praising Black: “I’ve always liked Jack and he’s funny and he’s good and he brings a different twist to it. He has heart, that’s true, and he’s maniacal. It’s a good combination. But someone asked me: ‘How much of you is in that character?’ I said: ‘None! It’s not me!’” \nBlack’s Stine begins as an angry man who feuds with Stephen King. The real Stine is quite different — and admires King. But Black himself is delightful, Stine says. The young actors agree. \n“He’s the most awesome guy,” Rush says. “He’s really warm and you’re never scared to ask him a question.” As for Minnette, he says: “He really is the best guy ... and I admire how he works and how he treats us and others.” Lee is in on the admiration society: “I would really say the same thing. Growing up on his movies, to work with him is amazing — and he did such a great job with the character.” \nTwitter: @Bruce_Kirkland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:12:34.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
