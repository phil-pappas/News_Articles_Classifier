Hey guys, go cry on Phil Cuzzi’s shoulder.\nIn wiping out the Cardinals and starter John Lackey in Game 4, the young Cubs hung the loss on the most experienced active pitcher in the postseason.\nIt had to be that way. It had to be Lackey against the Cubs of Joe Maddon and Theo Epstein.\nIn 2002, as a rookie, Lackey won Game 7 of the World Series for an Angels team on which Maddon served as bench coach.\nIn 2009, Lackey signed with Epstein’s Red Sox, and a couple years after Epstein came to the Cubs, Lackey would would again pitch a Series clincher, winning Game 6 in 2013 against --- this is too perfect --- the Cardinals.\nOn Tuesday night, Epstein’s and Maddon’s team slammed the F-bombing Lackey into the offseason after losing to him in Game 1.\nIn the just-completed series, all roads lead to Lackey. Or in the Cubs’ happy case, through Lackey.\nJustin Grimm struck out the side after Kris Bryant’s error put Cardinals on first and second with none out. Do they award saves for the fourth inning?\nClayton Richard dominates the seventh inning, but that seems flimsy. I mean, any Cubs pitcher who can retire the vexing Jason Heyward ought to get a statue.\nThen again, if all a guy has to do to get a save is throw, then I could live with awarding it to Jorge Soler.\nRizzo hadn’t homered on a 0-2 pitch during the regular season, by the way.\nExtra cameras for the TBS broadcast obstructed some views of home plate. Looked like the cameras also obstructed the view of TBS pitch window.\nKyle Schwarber jacked his homer so high and far that it could’ve carried a banner that read “National League Championship Series.’’\nThe TBS announcing crew called Schwarber’s home run as if it cleared the scoreboard in right and landed on Sheffield.\nOr maybe it landed on top of the scoreboard.\nWho knows, we didn’t see it land. We didn’t even see it leave Wrigley, if in fact it did the way the TBS announcers guessed.\nMaybe if TBS delegated its cameras better, it could follow the flight of a majestic home run and not ruin the view for which people paid good money.\nFormer Cubs general manager Jim Hendry was in attendance and got to see his draft choice, Javier Baez, play a big part in the biggest win since Hendry’s regime.\nJason Hammel, your plane is boarding.\nNext year will still be too soon to see Stephen Piscotty again.\nIf it’s spinning, Kolten Wong is missing it.\nSeriously, Trevor Cahill? Tony Cruz and Brandon Moss?\nEddie Vedder said Pearl Jam no longer will tour in October because of the Cubs. Dude, play Wrigley on the off days.\nUsually, Pedro Strop vs. the Cardinals is like Chris Sale vs. the Twins. But not in the eighth inning Monday. And not in the eighth inning Tuesday. Every eighth inning is officially on notice.\nHas “Lake Schwarber Drive’’ been taken? I’ll show myself out.\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Major League Baseball Chicago Cubs St. Louis Cardinals Anthony Rizzo Joe Maddon Boston Red Sox Jason Heyward", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561e55b9/turbine/ct-cubs-cardinals-rizzo-prediction-rosenbloom-20151014"], "published": "2015-10-14T16:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:54:46.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
