As previously reported, the slow-tempo ballad was recorded by the British singer for the latest \"James Bond\" movie, \" Spectre \". Shared online via Smith's Vevo page on Sunday, October 4, the visuals offers some scenes from the upcoming movie. Shots of Daniel Craig as the secret service agent flash in between scenes of the 23-year-old crooner standing in dapper suit among what looks like coffins wrapped in Union Jack flags and walking alone on a beach. \"Writing's on the Wall\" was co-written and produced by Smith's frequent collaborator Jimmy Napes. \"I tried to put myself in the shoes of Bond. My music is a diary and it's a recap of my life, and I wanted to bring that kind of honesty,\" he said when explaining the song in a recent interview. The track recently landed at No. 1 on the U.K. singles chart, becoming the first-ever \"Bond\" song to do so. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T04:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T10:00:17.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
