This time around, he is going to judge the \" America's Got Talent \" hopefuls during the upcoming eleventh season. He fills in the vacant spot left by Howard Stern . \"The good news is America's Got Talent is back next year and the even better news is so am I!\" he wrote on Twitter. \"About five or six years ago, I was offered the chance to be on the show and, at the time, I couldn't do it. But I was a bit disappointed that I wasn't able to,\" Cowell additionally told USA TODAY. \"For the years (Howard) was on the show, he did a great job. I think at the point we really knew Howard wasn't going to come back, we then had serious conversations with NBC. I thought, 'I think this is the right time.' So, I'm excited about it.\" Cowell wouldn't confirm whether or not the other judges, Melanie Brown , Heidi Klum , and Howie Mandel , would be back as well. \"They might decide since I've come back, they'll run for the hills,\" he joked. \"I have no idea. I know them all. I think they've done a great job. ... I thought we'd let the dust settle and then we'll meet everyone who's on the show and then we'll make some decisions.\" The \"AGT\" is hosted by Nick Cannon . Simon previously sat on the judge panel on the other talent shows like \" American Idol \" and \" The X-Factor \". \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T16:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:54:37.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
