Me and @sanctionedjohnnygalecki are just the best of buds- Leonard and Penny will just have to suffice!!!\" \nThe same day, Gilecki posted a slightly different photo with a similar sentiment: \"No scandals / home wreckers / pregnancies here, y'all. Just profound friendship.\" \nThe two, who play on-screen couple Penny and Leonard on the sitcom, dated for almost two years before splitting in 2010. \"It was a wonderful relationship, but we never spoke a word about it and never went anywhere together,\" Cuoco told CBS Watch! magazine in 2010. \n\"We were so protective of ourselves and the show and didn't want anything to ruin that,\" she explained. \nThe relationship ended because, \"Everyone was always asking, and we deny-deny-denied. … It took a little bit of a toll on me and I think it did for him, too,\" notes Cuoco. \nCuoco and Sweeting got engaged in September 2013, and tied the knot that New Year's Eve. They announced their breakup in September. \nGalecki split from actress Kelli Garner in August after more than two years together. \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
