Sometimes, bearing witness — that bold act of using words to speak one’s own \"truth\" to power — seems to accomplish nothing.\nLast week, Eastern Cape publication the Daily Dispatch exposed a plot by the registrar at the University of Fort Hare to sabotage the activities of the Democratic Alliance Student Organisation (Daso), which won this year’s Student Representative Council (SRC) elections. The newspaper published a recorded conversation in which Professor Mike Somniso described his plan to use uMkhonto weSizwe veterans to disrupt Daso events using physical force.\nAs writer Tom Eaton has noted, the lack of outrage — and, indeed, the lack of action — in response to this scandalous revelation is disturbing. \"How is it possible,\" asks Eaton, \"that, during this time in which SA’s universities are under intense scrutiny for anti-democratic tendencies, a senior university official at an historic university explicitly suggests outright thuggery against a democratically elected student government, only to be met with a collective ‘meh’ from the media and citizenry?\"\nHas Joe Public simply had enough of news stories about university campuses this year? If so, publications and broadcasters need to work harder to differentiate between various forms of \"disruption\". Insofar as the country’s universities have experienced some instability in 2015, this has largely been productive: #RhodesMustFall, #RhodesSoWhite, #Luister and other campaigns have initiated important conversations about transformation in higher education. They have done so in the belief that individual student testimonies encapsulate and convey collective experience.\nScholars such as Achille Mbembe and Nomalanga Mkhize have expressed reservations about these \"narratives of selfhood and identity ... saturated by the tropes of pain and suffering\" — Mbembe, because he sees them as being informed by our \"astonishing age of solipsism and narcissism\"; Mkhize, because she sees them as patterned on the \"particularism\" that has become ingrained in the humanities and in social research.\nDespite such criticisms, these student movements have forced academic departments and university administrators to reflect on institutional \"solipsism\" (or, at least, on the tendency of any large organisation or community to reproduce the race, class and gender dynamics of the society in which it has developed). The universities of Cape Town and Stellenbosch, and Rhodes in Grahamstown, have been the most prominent sites of protest, but it is a national phenomenon.\nIn other instances, the \"anti-democratic tendencies\" mentioned by Eaton have been regrettable but not fundamentally damaging. At my institution, the University of the Witwatersrand, there was controversy earlier this year over Hitler-loving student leader Mcebo Dlamini and a more recent fracas over the university’s suspension of the Economic Freedom Fighters for disruptive behaviour prior to the SRC elections. Despite what some news reports would have us believe, however, the academic project at Wits and elsewhere has not been compromised.\nYet the situation at Fort Hare is of a different order. It will be deeply worrying if the self-incriminating \"testimony\" of Professor Somniso does not lead to disciplinary proceedings and legal action. Sadly, South Africans know words are cheap when it comes to the African National Congress and its cronies. Condemning Hlaudi Motsoeneng and Mosebenzi Zwane rings hollow when nothing is done to fix the public broadcaster or stop the influence of the Gupta family on the country’s executive.\nThose in search of a more honest and earnest declaration of faith may turn to Adejoke Tugbiyele’s Testimony (at the Goodman Gallery Johannesburg until October 10). Combining text and imagery in a form similar to that of the graphic novel, the Nigerian artist gives an account of her life in narrative fragments, reminiscences and observations about the country of her birth — she lives in exile on account of Nigeria’s homophobic laws — that take us from Lagos to Florence, from New York to Barcelona.\nThis is a global account, and it touches on local manifestations of global issues: migration and its dangers, energy crises, crumbling urban infrastructure, consumerism. Tugbiyele shares her personal history (which has especially been marked by the stigmatisation of her sexual orientation) but avoids parochialism: she is attuned to others’ experiences of \"hardship\" and to their \"acts of survival\".\n• Adejoke Tugbiyele’s Testimony is on display at the Goodman Gallery, 10 Chester Road, Johannesburg until October 10", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T13:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:54:11.733+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
