And a lot of that was down to his classic 1990s show still raking him in the big bucks.But who is the highest-earning Brit? Not Michael McIntyre, not Peter Kay, not even Ricky Gervais. It's John Bishop - who earned $8 million (£5.1m), mainly thanks to his BBC specials.In case you were wondering - comedians are only included in the list if the largest chunk of their earnings came from gig ticket sales. © BBC / Lola Entertainment/Ellis O'Brien There are no women in the Top 10, despite stars including Amy Schumer and Chelsea Handler taking over the world lately. If the list included comedians in general rather than focusing on stand-up shows, then it may have looked quite different...Elsewhere, Kevin Hart climbs up to second from fifth in 2013, with earnings of £28.5m thanks to both touring and starring in several Hollywood movies such as Get Hard and The Wedding Ringer.Louis CK comes in seventh place with $9m, while Dave Chappelle's comedy comeback was enough to take him to 10th with $7.5m.The Top 10 in full:1.
