ANDERSONAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - Michelle Obama is grooving to the tunes of Beyonce, Demi Lovato and Esperanza Spalding as she celebrates the International Day of the Girl. \nThe first lady tweeted Sunday a link to her \"girl power\" music playlist on the streaming music platform Spotify. The U.N. has designated Oct. 11 to promote awareness for gender inequality around the world. \nMrs. Obama's playlist includes pop hits like Alicia Keys' \"Girl on Fire\" and \"Bang Bang\" by Jessie J, Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj. The first lady notes sisterhood with songs by girl groups including TLC's \"No Scrubs\" and \"Survivor\" by Destiny's Child. The playlist also includes some soulful tunes by Aretha Franklin, Diana Ross and Billie Holiday. \nMrs. Obama is promoting her \"Let Girls Learn\" campaign, which aims to expand access to education for more than 62 million girls around the world- some in developing countries- and encourages American girls to take advantage of their opportunities. \nPresident Barack Obama released his Spotify playlists while vacationing on Martha's Vineyard over the summer. His daytime and evening playlists included tracks by Justin Timberlake, Stevie Wonder, Bob Dylan, Mary J. Blige, Frank Sinatra and Lauryn Hill. \n___ \nOnline: \nMichelle Obama's playlist: http://bit.ly/1OskYT8 Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
