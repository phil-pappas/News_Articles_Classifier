READ MORE: Is Harry Hitting Back At Taylor Swift On 1D's New Song? \nThe One Direction singer reportedly had a secret fling with Nicole at the tail-end of 2013, when her on-off relationship with Lewis Hamilton was in one of its “off” stages. \nAccording to The Sun , the pair’s dalliance was never anything serious, although the newspaper claims that they did hook up multiple times. \nHarry Styles \n“Harry was obviously very taken by Nicole who is stunning and he had always looked up to her.” \nNicole Scherzinger \nThe source goes on to say that due to Harry’s romantic history with women considerably older than himself, including Caroline Flack and radio DJ Lucy Horobin, the 15-year age gap was never an issue. \nA friend of Nicole’s is also quoted as saying: “They did snog and got on well, but they never dated.” \nNicole was actually instrumental in Harry’s successful career, having put together One Direction from five solo artists while she was a guest judge on ‘The X Factor’ in 2010.   LOS ANGELES, CA - OCTOBER 28: (EXCLUSIVE COVERAGE) Singer Nicole Scherzinger (C) performs onstage during The Rocky Horror Picture Show 35th anniversary to benefit The Painted Turtle at The Wiltern on October 28, 2010 in Los Angeles, California.
