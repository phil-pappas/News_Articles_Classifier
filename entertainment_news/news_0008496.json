(Image via SyFy) Travel Deals Nick Vadala Posted: Friday, October 9, 2015, 12:22 PM \nThe Wells Fargo Center hosted the WWE for Smackdown earlier this week, with trio The New Day taking some time to insult both Eagles coach Chip Kelly and the city at large. \nFirst up on the list: Philadelphia’s history of poorly performing sports teams. The New Day is trashing the Eagles #WWEPhilly pic.twitter.com/FLrdHhHVMG — Nick Piccone (@nickpiccone) October 7, 2015 \n“Philadelphia, now we know that you know nothing about being champions,” The New Day member Xavier Woods said while holding a trombone for some reason. He seems to have forgotten that Philly teams have racked up some 17 championship victories since 1910. \nNext up was Chip Kelly. Not so much the man himself — but rather his name. \n“Chip,” Woods scoffed. “A grown man, and his name is Chip.” \nIf you’re a wrestler, that is apparently somehow an insult. Chip, for the record, though, actually has a pretty great name: Charles Edward Kelly. But, then, that’s not exactly as easy to mock. And more trashing... pic.twitter.com/OLJzhyl9Y1 — Nick Piccone (@nickpiccone) October 7, 2015 \nFor his next dig, Woods fired off a combo of two insults, bringing together the Eagles recent loss to the Redskins with Meek Mill’s loss to Drake in the summer feud. But that was only after he claimed Kelly had called him for advice on remaining positive. \n“The Philadelphia Eagles losing to the Redskins,” Woods said. “That’s like Drake versus Meek Mill, and y’all are Meek Mill.” \nThen, Woods wrapped things up with what may be the least clever, most nonsensical anti-Eagles chant for our “silly little team” ever developed: “E-A-G-L-E-S booty!” \nSadly, though, there was no instant karma here. The New Day member Big E went on to have a match against Dolph Ziggler following the group's Philly digs, winning with a little outside help. \nNext up, the Eagles will play the New Orleans Saints at Lincoln Financial Field. Let’s hope they don’t give the WWE’s wrestlers any more ammo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:35:11.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
