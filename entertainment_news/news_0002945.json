I've been stuck on piano, somewhere off Broadway, for years now. I want to go somewhere completely opposite of that.\"\nMeanwhile, animator Hewlett told NME that the band's visual look will also be altered for their fifth album. \"It's going to change – I can't tell you how,\" he said. \"But of course it's going to be different, I can't do what I've already done, that’s not interesting to me. In the same way Damon changes with his music and moves forward, I do the same. It's going to be a different look.\"\nMORE: Good news, Gorillaz fans: a new album is due for release next year\nMORE: The release date of Adele's third album has allegedly been confirmed for November\nMORE: Ouch!
