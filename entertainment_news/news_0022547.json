However, that may change in the near future thanks to his latest smash, \"Hotline Bling\". The track has been steadily climbing up the chart, with it most recently moving from No. 3 to No. 2. Everyone's hoping it will finally reach the top spot, and dethrone The Weeknd 's \"The Hills\", next week following the official music video's release. Reacting to the expectation, Drake said in an Instagram post he sent out on Thursday, October 15 that \"no accolades really matter to me other than the fact that I have never had a billboard number one.\" He continued that if he were to get his first No. 1 single this month, it would be \"the biggest moment of my career to date.\" \"If you are looking for me on that particular evening I will be passed out in the water slide that connects to our pool,\" he then joked before thanking his fans, \"I love you and thank you for these memories. I always love the moment right before it happens more than when it actually happens. So thank you ... even if it doesn't.\" A photo posted by champagnepapi (@champagnepapi) on Oct 15, 2015 at 12:30am PDT Drake actually has once topped the Hot 100, but as a featuring artist. He landed atop the list back in 2010 with Rihanna 's \"What's My Name\". \"Hotline Bling\" has tied his debut single \"Best I Ever Had\" which peaked at No. 2 in 2009. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T11:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:49:30.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
