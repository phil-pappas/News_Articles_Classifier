Click through for more kerfuffles between politicians and musicians. More \nThe Aerosmith frontman asked the billionaire to stop using the band's classic rock hit \"Dream On\" at his campaign events and rallies in a cease-and-desist letter Saturday, according to The Associated Press. \nHowever, only two days later, a defiant Trump walked onto the stage to \"Dream On\" at the \"No Labels Problem Solver Convention\" in Manchester, New Hampshire. \nTrump does \"not have our client's permission to use 'Dream On'\" or any of Tyler's music because doing so \"gives the false impression that he is connected with or endorses Mr. Trump's presidential bid,\" the letter says. \nTyler's attorney Dina LaPolt said that this is a copyright issue and not a \"political\" or \"personal issue\" with Trump. \nThe Trump campaign did not respond to CNN request for comment, but said the issue was resolved Monday morning. \n\"Actually that's all worked out,\" Trump said just minutes before walking out to his speech to the No Labels conference in New Hampshire. The real estate mogul did not elaborate. \nLast month, R.E.M. frontman Michael Stipe blasted Trump for playing \"It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)\" on the campaign trail. \nAnd in July, Trump got into a heated spat with rock singer Neil Young, after he asked Trump to stop playing \"Rockin' in The Free World\" at his rallies. \n\"Donald Trump was not authorized to use 'Rockin' In The Free World' in his presidential candidacy announcement,\" a statement from Young's management company said. \"Neil Young, a Canadian citizen, is a supporter of Bernie Sanders for President of the United States of America.\" \nTrump fired back at young, tweeting: \"A few months ago Neil Young came to my office looking for $$ on an audio deal & called me last week to go to his concert.
