TBS said Monday that the episode will air on Nov. 10. \nO'Brien said he'll be joined by his longtime assistant Sona Movsesian, who is of Armenian descent. \nSaid O'Brien: \"I think it's every boss' responsibility to take their assistant back to their ancestral land. That's why I'm going to make sure my next assistant was born in a five-star resort in Tuscany.\" Copyright The Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T23:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:26:30.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
