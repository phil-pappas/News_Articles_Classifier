Unfortunately it's not his own track, but we'll take these baby steps at this stage.The US actor/rapper/funny man has lent his vocals to a remix of Colombian band Bomba Estéreo's song 'Fiesta', which was released today (October 2).What's more, Big Willie shows off his bilingual chops on the track, rapping in both English and Spanish.\"When I was told that Will Smith wanted to collaborate on a remix with Bomba, I couldn't believe it,\" band founder Simon Mejia said. \"This opportunity to work with Will was beyond anything we have dreamed of... It's just magic.\"Last we heard about new music from Will Smith was when the 47-year-old revealed he'd been in the studio with Kanye West back in February. © Barry King/FilmMagic \"I'm not sure what I'm going to do yet but I'm exploring. I'm in a creative ceiling. My son tells me I have to write out the things I don't like,\" he said at the time. \"I can't write and stop, I have to keep going and going and write them out. I've never worked like that before but I think I might give that a shot.\"Since then, Will Smith has been filming upcoming blockbuster release Suicide Squad, where he will star as DC Comics villain Deadshot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:42:30.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
