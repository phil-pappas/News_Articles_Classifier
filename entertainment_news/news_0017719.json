Ross condenses the original three films (“A New Hope,” “The Empire Strikes Back” and “Return of the Jedi”) into a single hour, performing every character himself. \nBut, Ross has found success in the show he describes as “absurd,” performing it consistently since 2002. He says the show was a way to return to comedic acting. \n“I used to do nothing but comedy when I first tried acting when I was in high school,” says Ross, who also does a one-man version of “Lord of the Rings.” “I lost a bunch of weight. When that happened, I got cast in a lot of serious roles … I thought rather boring roles, actually.” \nThe show spurned from a conversation Ross had with his friend P.J., who ended up directing “One Man Star Wars Trilogy.” \n“We’d talk about how cool it would be to do a show that was like, a history of film,” Ross says. He was hoping to condense the first “Star Wars” film, “A New Hope,” into a two-minute bit. Instead, he wrote a 25-minute script. \nHe decided to perform it, and he was surprised when people kept up with his fast-paced re-enactment. So, he decided to do the same with “The Empire Strikes Back” and “Return of the Jedi.” \n“It certainly posed a crazy challenge,” Ross says. “Having done the first one, the other two were not as difficult. I think I cut out even more out of the other films. I was on a mission to make the show one hour long.” \nThe show is full of challenges — it’s fast-paced, physically demanding and requires Ross to be able to portray multiple characters in a single performance. \nIs there a character he prefers more than the others? \n“The emperor,” Ross says, applauding Ian McDiarmid’s performance. “He’s just such a rotten, terrible person. He’s a lot of fun to sink your teeth into. He’s just the worst possible person to invite over to your house.” \nAnd the most difficult to get just right? Yoda. Ross says he always struggled with impressions of the characters of Frank Oz, the voice actor who portrays the wise Jedi Master. (Oz also voiced Miss Piggy and Fozzie Bear on “The Muppet Show” and Cookie Monster, Bert and Grover on “Sesame Street.”) \n“I just had to get over that mental block,” Ross says. \nAside from nailing down those accents, Ross says the show has grown since its debut 13 years ago. He says the show is cleaner thanks to tighter transitions, like becoming a different character after getting up from a fall. \n“Things have evolved, I guess, and I’ve become more comfortable with all of it,” Ross says.
