David Milne, a professor at the University of East Anglia in the United Kingdom, scrutinizes the work of nine Americans who, beginning in the late 19th century, shaped their country’s relationship with the rest of the world.\nHis portraits are detailed, clearly the product of enormous amounts of research, and the result is a mini-encyclopedia about the philosophical foundations of America’s foreign policy.\nThe nine range from naval-power theorist Albert Thayer Mahan up through President Barack Obama. Mahan found a disciple in Theodore Roosevelt, who was eager to assert the rapidly maturing power of the United States. Obama has been far more cautious.\nViewpoints are balanced; Milne includes both George Kennan and Paul Wolfowitz. He also describes the work of Woodrow Wilson, Charles Beard, Walter Lippmann, Paul Nitze and Henry Kissinger. Regardless of the ideology of Milne’s respective subjects, two questions run throughout the book: What should be America’s role in the world? Is there middle ground between stolid isolationism and promiscuous engagement?\nThe dominant person in Milne’s array is Wilson, whose geopolitical philosophy was reflected at the end of the First World War in his Fourteen Points, which Milne calls “the single most important foreign policy statement of the 20th century.” Wilson was convinced that the world would benefit from embracing American-style democracy, a view to which his philosophical descendants, such as George W. Bush, have adhered. Bush, writes Milne, placed “strong emphasis on America’s role in fostering democratization.” In principle, sound; in practice, difficult.\nCountering the Wilsonians are pragmatists such as Kennan and Kissinger. Quote: : “We Americans must realize that we cannot be the keepers and moral guardians of all the peoples in this world. We must become more modest, and recognize the necessary limits to the responsibility we can assume.” Kissinger lamented that neocons desired “a return to a militant, muscular Wilsonianism,” rather than taking a more flexible, opportunistic approach that would put hard-boiled national interest ahead of idealistic adventurism.\nMilne’s appraisal of Obama is especially interesting in that it is free from the partisan invective that is so pervasive in today’s politics. Milne contends that Obama favors “pragmatism over ideology,” and that while Wilson believed that “a world of democratic, liberal-capitalist uniformity offered the best prospect of an enduring peace,” Obama thinks that “finite resources have to be redirected from neo-Wilsonian interventionism to the more pressing requirement of renewing the United States itself.”\nMilne offers a useful reminder to those who are eager for U.S. military action in Syria, Iran or elsewhere. He notes that during the presidency of the neocons’ idol, Ronald Reagan, U.S. troops were dispatched unilaterally overseas only once, and that was to Grenada.\nMuch of this book focuses on muscle-flexing, beginning with the Spanish-American War and continuing until the present day. In relationships with the rest of the world, however, America’s greatest asset might not be the strength of its armed forces, but rather its principles that are the foundation of individual liberty, economic enterprise, technological innovation and a generosity that has become manifest many times but is too often obscured by an eagerness to embrace militarism.\nMilne is evenhanded throughout this massive study (more than 500 small-print pages). He notes that “one must be careful to avoid hindsight, which makes gods of us all.” For a historian to avoid hindsight is an impressive feat, but in his nonjudgmental Worldmaking, Milne is generally able to do so. The result is a valuable addition to the literature of diplomacy.\nPhilip Seib is a vice dean and professor at the University of Southern California. His next book, “The Future of Diplomacy,” will be published in 2016.\nWorldmaking: The Art and Science of American Diplomacy\nDavid Milne\n(Farrar, Straus and Giroux, $35)\nAvailable Tuesday", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T01:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:00:37.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
