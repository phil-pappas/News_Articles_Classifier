So it was perfect,” he added. The reality TV personality, 56, is known for his unflinching honesty when it comes to critiquing performers. He previously judged “American Idol”, from its premiere in 2002 until he left in 2011 after nine seasons. \nAsked whether he will again show his tough side, he said, “I’m not going to lie to people when I think they’re hopeless, I just couldn’t do that! But no, of course I’m not going to be rude for the sake of being rude. That would be ridiculous. I’ll take it act by act.” \nStern, 61, joined the popular NBC show in 2012 for Season 7, and stepped down after Season 10 concluded in September. AGT is hosted by Nick Cannon, and judged by Howie Mandel, Heidi Klum, and Mel B, though none have been officially confirmed for Season 11 yet. \nThe show will be holding auditions for the upcoming season in many cities. \n  8:55 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:11:04.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
