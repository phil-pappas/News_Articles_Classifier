The actress who plays Eve Moneypenny in the James Bond franchise claims Craig was \"just being sarcastic\" when making the suicidal comment in response to the question whether or not he would return to the next 007 installment. Harris who will reprise her role in the upcoming entry, \" Spectre \", blamed the media for twisting Craig's words, telling BBC News that they were \"blown out of proportion.\" \"It was not as he intended it,\" she said, adding that her co-star's \"sense of humour ... doesn't come across particularly well in print.\" \"It's easy to take something that someone says in passing and blow it completely out of proportion. I think that's what's happened here, so I don't really believe those comments at all,\" the actress went on. \"Daniel lives and breathes Bond,\" she insisted. \"He's so dedicated to his craft and he loves playing Bond. According to PageSix, Daniel Craig got a scolding from Sony bosses following his controversial comment. A source suggested the actor was cranky during the interview because of the tough reshoot he did last month for the movie. Another insider said, \"He hasn't had a big hit movie outside of the franchise, and he blames that on Bond.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Naomie Harris News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:42:39.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
