Talk about a deadly alliance. Ronnie and Mick form a deadly alliance in EastEnders (BBC) \nIn the case of the Queen Vic landlord, it’s very personal: Dean, Mick’s little brother, raped his wife Linda. \nA traumatised Linda became pregnant shortly after the assault, but she wasn’t ready to reveal her ordeal to anyone, including her husband. \nThe truth eventually came out on Christmas Day in 2014. Linda went on to give birth to son Ollie, and was relieved when the child’s father was confirmed as Mick – not Dean. Dean Wicks played by Matt Di Angelo (BBC) \nBut, so far, Dean has escaped punishment for his heinous act. \nRoxy Mitchell is dating Dean, and big sister Ronnie doesn’t approve. She knows he’s a wrong ‘un, but attempts to convince her sibling to drop him have been unsuccessful. EastEnders resident Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) \nStruggling to control his emotions, a determined Mick meets with Ronnie and the pair confirm the details of their plan to get rid of Dean. \nWill Mick be able to go through with it?
