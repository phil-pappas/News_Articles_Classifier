Since my parents were music enthusiasts, I was able to witness a lot of performances by musical legends from Banaras like vocalist Girija Devi, who later became my guru, shehnai exponent, Ustad Bismillah Khan, danseuse Sitara Devi, tabla exponent Gudai Maharaj, who was a regular at Kajari Mahotsava held in Mirzapur, and many more. Exposed to the music traditions of Banaras from the beginning, I was drawn towards poorab ang gayaki.\nFor more interesting Music news and pictures follow us on Pinterest>>> timesofindia\nFor latest Music updates follow us on G+ >>> The Times of India Entertainment\nAs a five-year-old, I used to hum a composition ' Surajmukhi Na Jayibe Na Jayibe Hai Ram Bindiya Ka Rang Uda Jaiye Re', without even understanding the meaning of the lyrics. It was much later that I got to know that it was rendered by eminent vocalist Siddheshwari Devi from Banaras,\" shares Malini, adding, \"Once my father brought an LP record of compositions played by Ustad Bismillah Khan, it was a kajari tune that had me hooked. So even unknowingly, I was drawn to a genre of music that was very Banarasi.\"\nFor the latest in Music news, like us on Facebook >>> TOIEntertain\nIn her pursuit of music, Malini joined Bhatkhande Music University in Lucknow. \"Coincidentally, most of my music teachers in the institute were from Banaras. Though I was learning classical music, my yearning for poorab ang gayaki had not diminished. During an event held by our institute, I had the privilege to share the stage with Girija Devi. After my performance, she invited me to learn music from her. But unfortunately, I missed the golden opportunity as I was getting married,\" she reminisces. But destiny had other plans for Malini. \"After getting married, my husband, a bureaucrat, was posted in Banaras. I was elated. I told him that God has planned something special for me,\" says Malini, echoing the same excitement in her tone. She adds, \"On coming to Banaras, I went to meet Appaji (Girjia Devi) and requested her to take me as her disciple. This was the turning point in my life. I went beyond merely rendering thumri and shaiti as I was able to explain the story behind the compositions to my audience because of the knowledge given by my guru.\"\nHer familiarity with the local dialect, including Bhojpuri, made Malini sing from her heart. \"It was just not the music, I started living the spirit of Banaras. As a result, people connect me more with this city than from any other place. I am never considered an outsider in Banaras. The city has a certain personality and characteristics, which I feel have rubbed on to me. Artists from Banaras are forthright and never spare anyone who tries to come between them and their art. I too have displayed this quality several times during my performances,\" she says.\nMalini has recently bought a house in the city. \"I want to grow old in Banaras as there is a sense of belonging that I feel in the city. Banaras has everything that celebrates life, like music, food, clothes. At the same time it lends an inner peace, which stays with you forever, once you have realised it,\" she says as she signs off.", "external_links": ["https://www.pinterest.com/timesofindia/", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107628521107103264647/+TOIEntertainment/posts", "https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T15:38:37.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
