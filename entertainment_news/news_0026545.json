If you would like to be considered for a feature, email weddingsjerseystyle@gmail.com . \nLaura Stark and Matthew Bai have a residency match to thank for their meeting. \nIn the fall of 2010, Stark began her nursing career in the emergency department at New York's Mount Sinai Hospital. \nBai, a medical student at the time, was working in several hospitals before learning where he would complete his residency as an emergency physician. One of those hospitals was Mount Sinai. \n\"I remember thinking that she was pretty, and that she was especially kind to me during my rotation there,\" Bai, who began his residency at Mount Sinai in July 2011, said of Stark. \nThe following summer, he and Stark began a friendship that grew from Facebook chats to group hangouts to an unexpected first date on Nov. 2, 2012. \n\"One night, right after Hurricane Sandy, I was hungry,\" Stark said. \"And since we were already mid-conversation online, I asked if he wanted to join me for a meal at Shake Shack.\" \nIn true romantic comedy fashion, it began to rain while they ate their burgers outside. \nLater that night, Stark and Bai shared their first kiss, and the duo, once too preoccupied with their professions for love, have been inseparable since. Laura Stark and Matthew Bai wed at Conception Chapel at Mount Saint Mary Academy in Watchung. (RM Digital Photography) Their wedding date \nBai proposed to Stark at the observatory on top of Rockefeller Center on Dec. 23, 2014. \nThey quickly chose a wedding date and venue. \n\"We didn't want to waste much time before getting married,\" Bai, 32, said. \nIt was important to the couple that their out-of-town guests were able to attend their wedding. \nSo they chose to wed on Sept. 5. \nMarrying on a holiday weekend at the end of the summer proved convenient for the newlyweds and for their guests.

She wanted to get married at the Immaculate Conception Chapel on the school's Watchung campus — a privilege afforded alumnae. \n\"It has been my dream to get married there since I was 14,\" Stark, 27, said. \"My high school holds a very special place in my heart because I had a wonderful experience during my four years there making great friends — two of which were in my bridal party — learning how to prepare for life and receiving an excellent education.\" \nThe chapel is also stunning, she added. \nStark and Bai were married in a traditional Catholic mass at the Immaculate Conception Chapel. \nDeciding where to wed was an easy decision. Selecting a reception venue was a bit more difficult. \nThe couple considered several venues before visiting the Meadow Wood Manor in Randolph at the suggestion of the bride's parents. \n\"We went together and before we left, we both knew that this was the perfect place to have our wedding reception,\" Stark said. \nShe and her groom describe the staff as warm and welcoming and the decor as elegant and classic. \nThey booked the venue on the same day of their first visit.

(RM Digital Photography) What they splurged on \nBai and his bride spent the most on their honeymoon. \n\"We stayed on the island of Mo'orea in the French Polynesian Islands in a beautiful overwater bungalow,\" Stark said. \nThe couple also spared no expense for their wedding attire. \nInstead of renting a tuxedo, Bai bought a new suit, shirts, tie and shoes. \n\"Although my dress was a reasonable cost, I splurged on my veil,\" Stark said. \nShe wore a chapel length veil with a beaded trim. Stark had it custom made, which increased the cost. \n\"The extra money for Matt's tuxedo and my veil and accessories were totally worth it because we looked exactly how we both wanted to on our wedding day,\" Stark said. Where they saved \nThe couple spent less on the paper goods for their big day. \nStark's friend and former classmate, Catherine Salamon, whom she has known since kindergarten, made their invitations, ceremony programs and seating cards. \n\"Everything was beautifully made and she was a pleasure to work with,\" Stark said. \nSalamon's rates were pretty good, too. \n\"Because we have known her for many years, she gave us excellent prices,\" Stark said.

(RM Digital Photography) How they made their wedding special \nGetting married in her high school's chapel was a meaningful experience for Stark. \n\"I attended masses, assemblies and graduation in that chapel, so it holds a very special place in my heart,\" said Stark, a nurse practitioner. \nEveryone involved in the wedding mass was someone from Stark's high school career. \n\"The priest was my brother's high school teacher, Father Anthony Andreassi, the high school principal, Sister Lisa Gambocorto, helped administer communion during mass, the cantor, Michael Gasko, was a classmate of mine until eighth grade and the organist played at my childhood parish growing up,\" Stark said. \nStark also incorporated a Polish tradition to personalize the reception. \nAfter their grand entrance, Stark and Bai were greeted by their parents with wine, bread and salt. \n\"They give us bread to represent their wish for us that we never go hungry and always have food on our plates, the salt is to remind us of the saltiness of life and that when things go wrong, to remember we have each other to get through it,\" Stark said. \"The wine is to represent their wish that we always have drinks and are surrounded by good company.\" \nStark and Bai waited until after their big day to live together in New York. \n\"Unlike most couples these days, we did not move in together or go on vacation together until our wedding day,\" Stark said. \"It was special because the wedding actually made a difference in our lives and marked a time of change both emotionally and for our living situations and the nature of our relationship.\" Matthew Bai and Laura Stark during their first dance as husband and wife. (RM Digital Photography) \nStark said her wedding was just as she imagined it would be. \n\"I wouldn't change a single detail,\" she said. \nAmong the standout moments for the bride was walking down the aisle and seeing her groom for the first time, exchanging vows with Bai and the speeches from her family and bridal party at the reception. \nBai said his day was made with his first sight of Stark. \n\"When the chapel doors opened and I saw my now-wife in her wedding dress for the first time, it brought me to tears, which I did not expect to happen,\" Bai said. \"That is a moment and a feeling I will never forget.\" \nJanelle Griffith may be reached at jgriffith@njadvancemedia.com.
