The Hollywood star fought back tears as he joined hundreds of others to mourn Cathriona White, a 30-year-old who was found in her Los Angeles home after a suspected suicide.\nCarrey had dated the make-up artist in 2012 - but they had been pictured hand in hand earlier this year in New York.\nDuring the service at the Church of Our Lady of Fatima in Co Tipperary, Ms White was described as someone \"with an amazing capacity to love and to be loved\".\nHer stepsister, Sarah, told mourners: \"We need to find comfort for each other. There is no easy fix for grief, particularly when we have lost somebody so young with so much left to give.\"\nCarrey has described Ms White's death on 28 September as like being \"hit with a lightning bolt\".\nCathriona's death is being treated as a suicide by coroners in Los Angeles\nFather Tadhg Furlong added: \"Cathriona's approach to life was to take on, to challenge the country, the country, the world.\n\"You remember the outgoing personality - the strong-willed, determined character.\n\"Cathriona was a light to so many. Something of the light has gone out, yet much remains.\"\nMs White moved to LA in 2009 and took roles as an extra on a television show before working behind the scenes.\nA death notice said she was sadly missed by her sisters and brothers Lisa, James, Larina, Sarah and Tadhg, her stepmother Brid, mother Brigid, grandmother Lily, grandfather James and extended family members and a wide circle of friends.\n:: If you feel suicidal or vulnerable, click here to contact the Samaritans or call 116 123 .
