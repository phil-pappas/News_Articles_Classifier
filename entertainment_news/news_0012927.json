Stine in the movie opening Oct.16, opens up about becoming addicted to cocaine at the young age of 14, four years after his parents divorced.\n\"I remember just lots of turmoil from that time period,\" said Black, 46. \"I was having a lot of troubles with cocaine...I was hanging out with some pretty rough characters. I was scared to go to school (because) one of them wanted to kill me. I wanted to get out of there.\"\nHis parents enrolled him in Poseidon, a school for troubled youths, and it was there Black met a therapist who helped him chart a new course.\n\"I spilled my guts, telling him I felt guilty about stealing from my mom to get money for cocaine,\" said Black. \"I cried like a baby. It was a huge release and a huge relief. I left feeling euphoric, like an enormous weight had been lifted from me. It changed me.\"\nUSA TODAY\nJack Black takes us back to the '90s in a 'Goosebumps' rap video\nHe eventually made his way to Crossroads, a private school in Santa Monica where other future stars, like Jake Gyllenhaal and Liv Tyler went, and discovered a love for acting.\nToday Black and his wife Tanya have two sons, Thomas, 7 and Samuel, 9.\n\"Before Tanya, I had always felt like marriage was not for me,\" said Black. \"I didn't like the way it worked out with my parents. I didn't ever want to be in a divorce, so I was never going to get married.\"\nBut a big-budget movie changed his mind.\n\"Something happened when I was on King Kong ,\" he says. \"The fellow who plays King Kong, Andy Serkis, was there with his wife and kids, and he let me read a bedtime story to his kids. And I thought, Oh, I should have a kid. I want to have a family. There was an emptiness that started to develop after that. Now I'm happiest just swimming with my boys in the ocean.\"\n10 CONNECT 61 TWEET LINKEDIN 4 //usat.ly/1RyN0Lk TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://usat.ly/1RyN0Lk", "http://parade.com/428468/dotsonrader/428468/", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RyN0Lk&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5ff0121a21d867530d510be0a7acd950065979fc/c=85-0-2745-2000&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635800114684210998-AP-WORLD-PREMIERE-OF-GOOSEBUMPS---ARRIVALS-76482410.JPG", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RyN0Lk&text=Jack%20Black%20reveals%20cocaine%20addiction%20at%2014&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635800114684210998-AP-WORLD-PREMIERE-OF-GOOSEBUMPS---ARRIVALS-76482410.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635800114684210998-AP-WORLD-PREMIERE-OF-GOOSEBUMPS---ARRIVALS-76482410.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a248046470d762de27603b7d5a1b15bbc8a123f2/c=116-0-496-380/local/-/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798955252323066-jack-black-02.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-10T02:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:10:48.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
