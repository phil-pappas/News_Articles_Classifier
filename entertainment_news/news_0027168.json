Popular culture embraces this holiday. A good Halloween ballet is definitely overdue and might be a lot of fun. Alas, “Arcane: A Tale of All Hallows’ Eve,” which opened a week’s run Saturday evening at Fort Mason’s Cowell Theater , fails dismally in all the areas that count. No tricks, no treats here.\nThe perpetrator of this misfire is Charles Anderson whose Company C Contemporary Ballet has been on hiatus the last couple of years. The time away has not sharpened Anderson’s choreographic gifts. He spins a clotted, complex narrative (too complex for a family entertainment) that gets woolier as the 70-minute piece drags on. The dances lack continuity and imagination. The décor by Patrick Toebe is overly complicated in its reliance on steampunk style and the grim lighting keeps us from seeing Laura Hazlett ’s costumes in any detail.\nA good story ballet tells itself in movement and gesture; a good story ballet does not need an overheated synopsis inserted in the program. Nor does it need an onstage narrator ( John Hale ), who speaks in rhyme; the effect is creepy, and children, whom this production is courting, may be bored.\nArcane (Phyllis Affrunti on Saturday evening) is a star who, with the help of an astrologer ( Taurean Green ) descends to earth for one night and releases all kinds of malevolent, undead forces and episodes from the past, They include a dancing raven ( Greg DeSantis ), a dead bride (Megan Terry), a trio of orphans, a gaggle of ghosts, lots of bugs, a quartet of skeletons and a gaggle of pumpkins (wearing the gourds on their posteriors).\nWhen traditional figures from the Day of the Dead celebrations appear, hopes are temporarily raised for some vibrant choreography. Yet, Anderson throws them into the same unisons that almost everybody else gets. Bugs crawl across the stage, ghosts flit across the scene in white. If there’s a message here, it gets lost.\nThese dancers, including the children, give dedicated performances. Affrunti’s pointe work is unassailable; Perez partners conscientiously, but the choreography, with its profusion of ronds de jambe and turns, lacks invention. Why should we care about these people? That’s a question Anderson should have asked himself .\nIn one area, Anderson did well. He hired a 10-member chamber orchestra conducted by Mary Chun to perform the original score by Michael Krisukas, lively music that often seems at odds with this particular story. Unfortunately, the Cowell Theater lacks an orchestra pit, rendering it unsuitable for many dance companies. The musicians perform on the floor and sightlines are a problem. If you attend “Arcane,” sit to the back of the auditorium.\nAllan Ulrich is The San Francisco Chronicle ’s dance correspondent\nCompany C Contemporary Ballet: Charles Anderson’s “Arcane: A Tale of All Hallows’ Eve.” Through Saturday, Oct. 31.
