This, however, was not an ordinary Bollywood dance mob; in accordance with the new topless “Desnudas” in Times Square, the flash mob dancers were nude. Painted in green and gold “fusion saris,” the dancers performed to “Chammak Challo” from the film, “Ra One.” \nTo no surprise, the dance was filmed and soon took the Internet by storm. Despite the usual excitement for Bollywood dances, many Indians, however, did not enjoy the flash mob. Some within the Indian-American community were extremely distraught and insulted by this dance, and its obvious cultural appropriation. \nIt appears as though many Indian-Americans did not appreciate the creativity of the sales promotion and felt as though Rebtel was extremely disrespectful towards the Indian culture. \nIndians who felt that this Bollywood dance was too sexual or vulgar have not been keeping up with the latest Bollywood film trends. In more recent years, Bollywood has taken a very sharp turn towards “Western modernity.” These films no longer shy away from sex, sexuality and vulgarity. Item numbers are more seductive than ever, and it is not uncommon for female characters to partake in sexual activity; even the outfits worn by actresses have become more “scandalous.” Not to mention, the lyrics of Bollywood hits have become saturated with sexual innuendo. \nThe Indian film industry has welcomed Sunny Leone, a well-known Desi pornographic actress. Sunny Leone has starred in Jackpot (2013), Ragini MMS 2 (2014) and Ek Paheli Leela (2015). Leone gained a great amount of popularity following the hit song, “Baby Doll” in Ragini MMS 2 . \nWhile the viewer does not see a full nude image of Leone in this particular video, very little is left to the imagination. The irony is that one does not need to use their imagination—he/she can simply log onto Leone’s personal website. This is an actress who has not only been welcomed into the Bollywood community but is clearly gaining success as well. \nSo, was this flash mob only an insult to the Indian culture because the performance, itself, was not Indian? It is interesting, then, that her blatant sexuality was not insulting to Indian-Americans, but this dance was. \nIndeed, the way in which Indian culture is commonly understood—and, in many circumstances, practiced—does view sexuality as taboo. Yet, many aspects of India’s history embrace sexuality rather than condemn it. One of the most obvious examples is the “Kama Sutra.” Kama , meaning pleasure, is greatly appreciated and recognized as one of the four goals in Hinduism (the others being moksha , dharma, and artha .) \nThe “Kama Sutra” is extremely detailed and even specifies the meaning of specific fingernail imprints left on a lover during intercourse. These, however, are aspects of Indian culture that Indian-Americans tend to circumvent as we preserve our identity as a reserved culture. \nIt seems as though, at times, Indian culture encourages one to enjoy or even be in touch, with their sexuality. In the many disapproving comments left on articles and videos of the performance, however, the phrase “disrespecting our culture” was a favorite. My question then is, how was our culture disrespected when it seems as if some aspects of our culture condone sexual expression? The dancers were not dressed as deities of any specific Indian religion; they were simply painted with Indian attire dancing to an Indian song. Is it then wrong for a people to partake in sexual intercourse while listening to Indian music? Is it wrong for people to partake in sexual activity while wearing Indian clothing? \nThe real question is, then, how does this performance, which can be considered art to many, be disrespectful to the culture of India—especially when many aspects of Indian culture embrace sexuality? To be quite frank, I found that this performance displayed the versatility and unique paradox of India. One thing is certain, it definitely gave a new meaning to #IndiaUnlimited. \nModified Date: October 1, 2015 1:22 AM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T22:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:23:44.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
