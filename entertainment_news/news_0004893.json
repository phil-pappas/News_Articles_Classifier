Abrams takes over George Lucas’ “Star Wars” franchise and unfurls his $200 million spectacle, “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\" \nEven with more than 10 weeks to go until the film's December release, the \"Star Wars\" publicity machine is already working overtime. \nIn supermarkets, there’s suddenly “Star Wars” cereal with marshmallow Stormtroopers and lightsabers sharing shelf space with “Star Wars”-branded cans of Campbell’s soup and Spaghetti-Os featuring everyone from Darth Vader and Chewbacca to Yoda and C-3PO. \nAnd last month, the film’s official merchandise got a much-hyped, Black Friday-type midnight release called “Force Friday” that had Jedi-lovers lining up outside of stores like Target and Walmart under the moonlight. \nMel Brooks' words in “Spaceballs,” his 1987 “Star Wars” parody, are as valid now than ever: “Merchandising! Merchandising! Where the real money from the movie is made!” (Sorry kids, there are no official \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\"-themed flamethrowers available.) \nIt doesn’t take a marketing wizard to realize that now is a great time to trot out anything “Star Wars” related and that’s why Wilmington theater company Bootless Stageworks is bringing back \"Star Wars: A New Musical Hope,\" their original musical parody of the 1977 film. \nWhile much of the run-up to the new film is laced with feelings of déjà vu, it’s safe to say that \"Star Wars: A New Musical Hope\" is unlike anything “Star Wars” fans have ever seen. \nWell, unless they were there for the string of nearly sold-out shows in 2012 when the company first debuted the show, filled with inside jokes, satire, songs and, of course, those still-cool-after-all-these-years lightsabers. \nThe musical, which kicks off at St. Stephen's Church (1301 N. Broom St., Wilmington) Friday night and runs through next weekend, is an all-ages show that has drawn plenty of “Star Wars” fan families, showcasing the franchise’s timelessness with wide-eyed children across nearly four decades. \n“We have a few friends that have instilled their love of ‘Star Wars’ in their children and they are going to be able to come and see this show as a family,” says Bootless’ executive and producing artistic director Rosanne DellAversano. “I’ll be really happy to see all those kids out there.” Buy Photo \nJar-Jar Binks makes an appearance - but don't worry, it's brief - during a rehearsal for the Bootless Stageworks production of \"Star Wars: A New Musical Hope.\" (Photo: WILLIAM BRETZGER/THE NEWS JOURNAL) \nThis time around, the show has been tweaked with new jokes, a new fully-robotic R2-D2 and a new three-tiered stage, better utilizing the theater company’s new space at St. Stephen's. (The 2012 run of the show was held in their old home at OperaDelaware.) \nTickets are $15. \nThe theater group moved to the church, located about four blocks away from the Delaware Children’s Theatre, after the church’s old social hall became available. The only catch was that the room needs about $80,000 in renovations, DellAversano says. \nAnd that’s one of the main reasons “A New Musical Hope\" is back – because it was a hit and made money, something Bootless needs plenty of these days. \n“With the movie coming out, the timing was perfect,” she says. “We’re trying to do these money-maker shows to bulk up and pay for what we need to get done.” Buy Photo \nStormtroopers perform during a rehearsal for the Bootless Stageworks production of \"Star Wars: A New Musical Hope.\" (Photo: WILLIAM BRETZGER/THE NEWS JOURNAL) \nThe 2-hour-plus show is patchwork. \nDellAversano discovered the songs online, written by Timothy Edward Smith and Hunter Nolen, and the duo agreed to let Bootless pair their music with a script written by Philadelphia playwright Jeremy Gable. \nDellAversano’s husband, James Fuerst, who co-founded Bootless with his wife, will step into the role of Darth Vader. Fuerst, the music director for the show, is one of only a few new actors in this run of “A New Musical Hope\" since most of the cast from 2012 is returning. (Another newcomer of note is Philadelphia-based actor Caleb Duffy, who will play Luke Skywalker.) \nSo why did Fuerst decide this is the time to put on the iconic helmet and play one of the greatest film villains of all time? \n“He wanted to do it the first time and I wouldn’t let him,” laughs DellAversano, who is admittedly not a “Star Wars” geek. \nPrincess Leia (Maria Leonetti), hair buns and all, takes the stage with R2D2 during a rehearsal for the Bootless Stageworks production of \"Star Wars: A New Musical Hope.\" (Photo: WILLIAM BRETZGER/THE NEWS JOURNA) \nEven so, she was there in 1977 when the original film came out, sneaking out of St. Mark’s High School early to see it with a group of nearly 20 friends. \nDellAversano is still drawn to the original, mostly because Lucas was able to pull off his ambitious new world with an $11 million budget. (The film made a little more than $300 million in theaters domestically.) \n“It's seeing that kind of success come from people getting together and just saying, ‘Let’s do this,’” she says. “And that’s the same kind of feeling we have here at Bootless. We joke that we’re like little George Lucases running around and telling our friends, ‘Hey, let’s do this!’” \nPhiladelphia actor Shaun Yates, 33, will return to play Obi-Wan Kenobi, following in the footsteps of Alec Guinness and Ewan McGregor. \nHe knows firsthand the bond that “Star Wars” can build within families. He grew up watching the films with his father and there’s little doubt where they will be Dec. 18 when “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” takes over nearly every movie screen in the country. \nObi-Wan Kenobi (Shaun Yates) sings as Luke Skywalker (Caleb Duffy) shares the stage during a rehearsal for the Bootless Stageworks production of \"Star Wars: A New Musical Hope.\" (Photo: WILLIAM BRETZGER/THE NEWS JOURNA) \n“It gets released on my father’s birthday, so we’re taking him out for the opening day,” says Yates, who is also the show’s assistant music director, helping out because of Fuerst’s additional role as Darth Vader. \nSo how is Bootless getting away with a “Star Wars”-themed show without forking over stacks of cash to “Star Wars” rights owner Walt Disney Co.? \nSince it is satire and parody, free speech and the First Amendment kicks in. Even so, DellAversano makes sure to alert the audience before each show. \nLike the original “Star Wars” opening crawl that begins with, \"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away,\" Bootless has one of their own. \n“We explain that this is very much a parody,” she says, “and we ask Mr. Lucas and Mr. Mouse not to sue us.” IF YOU GO \nWHAT: Bootless Stageworks' production of \"Star Wars: A New Musical Hope\" \nWHEN: Friday through Sunday and Thursday Oct. 15 through Saturday Oct. 17 \nWHERE : St. Stephen's Church, 1301 N. Broom St., Wilmington \nTICKETS : $15 in advance or $18 at the door \nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.
