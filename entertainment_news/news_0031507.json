Of course all the neighbours arrive over for \"a night they won't remember\". We'll take a massive stab in the dark and guess that it all goes a bit pear-shaped, how fresh. But whether the plot is obvious of not, we're definitely tuning in to give it a go, mainly because Katherine Parkinson is starring, and she's always hilarious.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T18:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:47:47.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
