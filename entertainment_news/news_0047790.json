It's a demanding job. There are a lot of expectations. But when you manage and you can go to the ballpark on an everyday basis and play in front of a packed house in a wonderful atmosphere, you have to enjoy that situation immensely.\n\"We got to the postseason a couple of years and just didn't do well in the postseason.\"\nPiniella is one of four living managers who have taken the Cubs to the postseason, along with Jim Frey (1984), Dusty Baker (2003) and Jim Riggleman (1998). Piniella is the only one of the living former managers to do it twice, in 2007 and '08, when the Cubs won division titles but were swept in the National League Division Series.\nBaker concurred with Piniella, saying the degree of difficulty isn't any more daunting than any other manager or head coach faces. Baker's six postseason victories in '03 puts him second on the Cubs' all-time postseason list to Chance's 11 (1906-08 and 1910), but he never returned in his last three years in Chicago.\nAfter the Cubs' implosion in the 2003 NLCS and a late-season collapse in '04, Baker said the lack of resources from the owners in 2005 and '06 was their biggest obstacle.\n\"We were in a position to reload and try again, but then we started dismantling our team,\" he said. \"I didn't know the problems (Tribune Co.) was having at the time. That was bad timing because the (company) was about to be sold and stuff that I had no clue was tied to us.\n\"I was like, 'Man, we need some players.' We got rid of Moises (Alou) and Sammy (Sosa) at the same time. That's 60-something homers and 225 RBIs. Not to mention (Mark) Prior and (Kerry) Wood (getting injured) after that. I was like 'Damn, the whole world was crumbling.'\n\"Oh well. It didn't happen. But I wish Joe well, big-time.\"\nCubs general manager Jed Hoyer said managing the Cubs doesn't have as many obstacles as many other teams, and is now one of the better jobs thanks to the resources Chairman Tom Ricketts has provided.\n\"Over the last 107 years it has proven to be the most difficult, and I think it's a job that certainly is challenging,\" Hoyer said. \"You're in a major market. You have a rabid fan base. But I certainly think it's a doable job. It's a job that's attainable.\n\"You have to have the best team and you have to get hot in October. I don't think there are inherent obstacles. Maybe there have been in the past.\"\nBefore Tribune Co. was sold in April 2007, it increased the payroll for Piniella, whose '08 team won 97 games but lacked pitching depth and proved to be too right-handed in the postseason.\n\"We didn't face any left-handers in the two postseasons,\" he said. \"That's unheard of. What I like about this year's team specifically is it has a really good combination of left-handed and right-hand hitting, and power from both sides.\"\nBaker, who will be working the playoffs for TBS, and Piniella, who will be watching from his home in Tampa, both said the Cubs have a good shot at ending the drought, pointing to Maddon's leadership skills and the rise of Jake Arrieta.\n\"I don't think anybody knew Arrieta was going to be this good,\" Baker said.\nAdded Piniella: \"Arrieta probably is the Cy Young winner.\"\nMaddon doesn't need any unsolicited advice from Baker or Piniella, and neither offered any. But both stressed the need to play relaxed and to shut out the incessant talk about the Cubs' past.\nPiniella knows Chicago will be on edge, as it usually is whenever the Cubs are playing in October.\n\"I would expect the expectations are quite high again,\" he said. \"It's a shame the way they're playing they didn't win their division, but I would think Pittsburgh and the Cubs are better teams than St. Louis, which has been decimated by injuries. They did all they could to hang on.\"\nBaker didn't have a good ending in Chicago, but he still has a soft spot for the fans.\n\"It'd be good for the city if they won,\" Baker said. \"And once you get the young guys to believing they belong, it could be a similar situation like Atlanta when they were in the hunt every year.\"\npsullivan@tribpub.com\nTwitter @PWSullivan\nPrivacy Policy Major League Baseball Chicago Cubs Joe Maddon Jake Arrieta National League Dusty Baker World Series", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560dec4c/turbine/ct-tough-job-joe-maddon-cubs-sullivan-spt-1002-20151001"], "published": "2015-10-02T05:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:00:10.395+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
