The single's release date is November 6 and will be digitally distributed via Sony Music's The Orchard . Soul'd Out will get its World Premiere on the popular music site The Vinyl District on October 28. The single is now available for download to Radio prior to the official release date via AirPlay Direct , where the previous release, DownTown Mystic on E Street reached #1 on the APD Rock Albums & Singles Charts.\nThe Soul'd Out Digital Single contains 3 tracks, including the rocker Brian Jones and a previous unreleased radio mix of Rise and Fall #2 . Soul'd Out is the follow-up to the successful summer release, DownTown Mystic On E Street , an EP that features the Rock'n'Roll Hall of Fame rhythm section from Bruce Springsteen's legendary E Street Band--drummer \"Mighty\" Max Weinberg & bassist Garry W. Tallent. 2 singles have generated worldwide Radio airplay from the EP, which has received rave reviews.\nSoul'd Out is an emotional powerhouse of a track featuring the trademark DownTown Mystic sound. Co-written by DownTown Mystic writer/producer Robert Allen and lyricist Martin Samuel , Soul'd Out takes a very open look at someone going through the heartbreak at the end of a relationship. Robert adds, \"I knew the track would need a bigger arrangement and production than what I initially had to match Martin's lyrics. They're so devastating; I needed to channel a singer like Sam Smith to convey the amount of emotion that the lyrics contain\". Robert is helped out on the track by Trixter's Steve Brown on acoustic 12-string and PJ Farley on bass.\nIn the Swinging London of the 1960s, the anti-establishment band was The Rolling Stones, and the wildest Stone was Brian Jones. The phrase sex, drugs & rock'n'roll is said to have originated at that time and could have been coined to describe Brian's lifestyle. Besides forming and naming The Rolling Stones , he was one of the leading forces in the British Blues explosion. He also fathered 6 illegitimate children and took drugs by the handful. He drowned in his swimming pool a month after being fired from the band he had started, joining the infamous 27 Club . The Stones went on to become even bigger and more successful. Today, Brian is little more than a footnote in their history.\nTwo of the key features of Brian Jones are the hints of 7 famous Stones songs contained within, and the other is the killer harmonica part that represents Brian in the song. Robert says \"after recording the track I felt like something was missing but couldn't put my finger on it. One night I went to a party and someone asked me if I was looking for a harp (harmonica) player. A light went off and I immediately knew what I needed to finish the track. It took me back to the first time I saw the Stones on TV and there was Brian Jones playing harmonica. I decided to have the harmonica represent Brian to give him a voice in the song\".\nBesides the Soul'd Out Single, DownTown Mystic's music can also be heard in the newly released indie movie Cam Zink: Reach For The Sky about Freeride mountain biking legend Cam Zink . Speaking of being heard, with Streaming becoming more important these days, it's increasingly necessary for artists to get their music heard. It used to be that an album would be released and then singles were issued from it. Soul'd Out is the 4th single to be released prior to DownTown Mystic's upcoming Rock'n'Roll Romantic album, due out in 2016.\n\"Soul'd Out is an exceptional little release. The tunes are accessible, lyrically layered, and consistently compelling throughout.\" Brett Stewart/The Independent Spotlight\n\"Brian Jones may be the defiant highlight of this release. It's sharply written, massively fun, and the Stones homage is a hell of a good one.\" Brett Stewart/The Independent Spotlight\n\"the band's infectious unmistakable vibe, wrapped up with ace musicianship, topped with great songwriting, and delivered with powerful, heartfelt vocals. This is the place to start for timeless rock n' roll!\" Rick Jamm/JamSphere Magazine\nSoul'd Out on SoundCloud: http://tinyurl.com/no36x7a\nSoul'd Out Video: https://youtu.be/wf3SsrlC-Ms\nBrian Jones Video: https://youtu.be/rwlwVLgl4gc\nSoul'd Out available on:\nAmazon: http://t.co/JrSoyfUeL6\niTunes: https://t.co/z85DW7Lf2y\nGooglePlay: http://tinyurl.com/nm2zgvp\nDownTown Homepage: http://downtownmystic.net\nTwitter: @DTMysticband\nDownTown Mystic YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/DowntownMystic1\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/DownTown-Mystic/33506110940\nAirPlay Direct: http://www.airplaydirect.com/music/downtownmystic\nSha-La Music: http://shala.com\nTwitter: @shalaman\nFormed in 1987, Sha-La Music, Inc. is an independent Publishing & Production company that includes a Record Label with worldwide digital distribution from The Orchard.
