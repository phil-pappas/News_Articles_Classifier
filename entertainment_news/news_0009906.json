While well-known for his work at his eponymous label as well as Fendi and Chanel, this exhibit may introduce consumers to a new aspect of the designer’s work and aesthetic. \nCreative process Rather than defining the designer’s work in a set construct, this installation celebrates its diversity. \nMr. Lagerfeld has been quoted on photography saying, “People always want to know what my photographic style. I do not know. It is the observer to tell me. I do not have a style, but several, or none. Never stand still, neither in life nor in fashion and photography.” \nIn addition to experimenting with different subject matter, he has tried out various techniques, such as daguerreotypes, platinotypes, Polaroid image transfers, résinotypes, Fresson prints, serigraphs and digital prints. \nK arl Lagerfeld at the exhibit \nTwo main circuits, titled “Daphnis and Chloe” and “The Journey of Odysseus” span his entire photographic career. \nMr. Lagerfeld fell into professional photography by accident, when in 1987 the image director for Chanel at the time Eric Pfrunder came to him needing images for a press kit. The designer stumbled upon a medium that brings together his creative pursuits. \nToday, the designer shoots many of the advertising campaigns for the fashion houses he heads. \nThe exhibit will be up through March 20, giving fashion fans ample time to explore. \nBeyond his own labels, Mr. Lagerfeld has lent his photographic eye to other branded efforts. \nIn 2012, British automaker Rolls-Royce Motor Cars gained visibility through a new exhibit in its “Icons of Art” series featuring photographs by Mr. Lagerfeld. \nThe exhibit titled “A Different View” portrayed the design elements of Rolls-Royce and was on display at the Rolls-Royce headquarters in Goodwood, West Sussex, England. The exhibit focused on Mr. Lagerfeld’s abstract take on the textures, surfaces and shapes in the vehicles ( see story ). \nEarlier this year, fashion designer Mr. Lagerfeld’s entire storied 60-year career at houses including Chanel, Chloé and Fendi was explored via the first ever retrospective held at the Art and Exhibition Hall of the Federal Republic of Germany in Bonn. “Modemethode” displayed 126 looks and accessories, from his 1954 International Woolmark Prize-winning coat, which was instrumental in his hiring at Balmain, to a neoprene wedding dress created for Chanel autumn/winter 2014-15. While the focus was on the designer’s creative process and methods, this exhibit simultaneously shone a light on the kind of design talent and craftsmanship hired by the houses he has worked for ( see story ).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T11:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:08:11.202+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
