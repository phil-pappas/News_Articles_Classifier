Perfect weather and beautiful light. I love Savannah when it’s like this!”\n“I can’t believe it, 60 wonderful years of friendship and beautiful memories had by all who attended the 1955 Commercial High School Reunion. The Lady in Red said we’re like good wine or cheese. We just get better with age!”\n“Thanks to the YMCA for providing special needs children something to do.”\n“I love the insert the city put in my water bill. I need to be careful to protect our watershed by not over fertilizing, or leaving dog poop in the yard, or using too much insecticide. But hey, it’s perfectly fine to dredge to within 2 feet of our aquifer in the name of progress, regardless of the perils to our future drinking water.”\n“Lindsey Graham keeps telling us how many times he’s been to Afghanistan. At what cost and how are we better off for his having gone?”\n“I retired after 45 years of working at a local company. Was ready for retirement in June 1996 and the bottom fell out. I lost almost 50 percent of my 401(k), when the recession hit. Now the government said zero increase on Social Security accounts because of low gas prices. We spend most of our income on food, medicine, health insurance, and doctor and hospital bills. American seniors have taken it on the chin very hard. Hope you have not been to the hospital lately. It’s highway robbery. Is this the American way?”\n“Thanks Pooler Officer Howard for helping my 92-year-old mother-in-law when she couldn’t find her car at Tanger Outlet. You’re the best!”", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-24T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:15:29.559+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
