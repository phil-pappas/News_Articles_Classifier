The Prime Minister should immediately remove him from cabinet,” the party insisted in statement.

Singh found himself at the center of a row earlier this week when he tried to defend Centre over the Sunped incident saying the Government can’t be blamed “for everything…Like if somebody throws a stone at a dog”. “See, the thing is, never associate local incidents with the Central government (sarkar). There is an inquiry going on. There was a dispute between families. The dispute…How did it turn out…Where did the administration fail, after these it come to the Centre. ”For everything…Like if somebody throws a stone at a dog, then the government is responsible…It is not like that,” Singh said in Ghaziabad, the constituency he represents in Parliament, while referring to the burning alive of a Dalit family allegedly by upper caste Rajputs in Haryana’s Faridabad which left two toddlers dead on the intervening night of October 19-20. The former army chief, however, had later clarified his statement was not intended to draw an analogy between the Faridabad incident and stoning of a dog. \n  2:23 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T11:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T12:02:13.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
