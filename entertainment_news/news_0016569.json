But overall music revenue slipped only slightly to $3.2 billion thanks to the rapid rise of streaming, the Recording Industry Association of America has said.\nStreaming accounted for one-third of the industry's total revenue, up from 26 percent in the first six months of 2014, the association said.\nDeezer took its first steps into the US market last year via a partnership with Sonos, a US manufacturer of wireless audio systems. It has since also acquired Stitcher, the main US independent provider of podcasts and content, enabling the French start-up to launch a combined offer of music and podcasts.\nWhile not yet profitable on a global level, Deezer reported in 2014 a 53 percent jump in revenue to 142 million euros, and it is aiming to exceed 750 million euros in revenue by 2018.\nInvestment & Company Information Finance Deezer music streaming", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:45:25.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
