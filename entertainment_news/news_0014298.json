EastEnders have just done it very well with 'Who Killed Lucy?' and that was obviously stretched over several months. \"You can pick a timeframe I guess, and I like stories that go along with quite a pace. I felt with a storyline like this, where you've got five or six potential suspects, it's nice to pick them all off at a bit of a lick and keep the audience engaged over that period of time. It's just a judgement call and that's the way we chose to do it.\"As well as the Robert plot, Emmerdale chiefs are promising to reveal two other shocking secrets in the flashback which will rock the village forever. \n© ITV \nEmmerdale promo picture for rewind episode Oates continued: \"Obviously I know that other shows have done flashback episodes before, so in that sense it's not new. But what's unique about this episode is that we do weave it around other stories, which we will carry forward.\"That's what we really wanted to do. We were aware that we had our work cut out telling the story in a 'rewind' way, because other shows have done it before and done it so well. To make ours different, we wanted to impart other story strands which would then go on much further. \"I'm really pleased with the response to the whodunit. We've been really lucky because this storyline really started last autumn with Robert and Aaron getting together. Then there was a huge moment with Katie's death in February, rolling onto the big summer episodes with the helicopter and then knocking onto this in the winter. \"I'm glad that we've been able to build those stories and everything's had a cause and effect. They're the best stories and they will continue into the winter. Hopefully the reaction will just grow and grow.\" Emmerdale continues on Thursday (October 1) at 7pm on ITV.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:59:11.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
