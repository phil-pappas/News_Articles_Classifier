Gadda Viji who directed + does away with the idea of a hero and villain. \"The film takes place in the world of medicine and how the events there affect the outside world at large,\" says Viji. Going by the looks of Anant Nag and Ravishankar in the film, it looks like it is a commercial fight between a scientist and a demon.\nThe images of these two actors create confusion whether the film is sci-fi or mythological. \"This is not a regular film.That's for sure. The basic story is about a scientist on the verge of a breakthrough and the forces that are out to prevent it.Then there are others who are trying to foil the attempts of those trying to prevent the breakthrough. Everyone has something positive. + is a positive symbol, and that is the reason it is the title of the film,\" says Viji.\nAnother film, Lucia, was about a tablet and hallucinations caused by it. Asked about the similarities, Viji said \"Lucia was about the effects of a drug on one person. + does not enter that territory at all. It is more about the good old fight between good and evil, but in a backdrop that is very new to our films. With the medical world as a backdrop, I was able to present things that are not normally seen in films. Since only the looks of two characters have been revealed so far, it looks like a sci-fi mythology film. I promise there are many more surprises.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:13:22.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
