Rollo Ross reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript \nThere was a tremor in the Force on Monday when the new trailer for Star Wars: The Force Awakens went live around the world. But while the US chose to show the trailer during the halftime of an ESPN National Football League Game, China went a little more epic with light sabre wielding fans and stormtroopers overtaking their iconic Great Wall where the trailer was shown for the first time. SOUNDBITE Star Wars fan, Wang Xu, saying (Mandarin): \"The affection for Star Wars has not eased in the past 30 years. As more episodes were released, the affection increased dramatically. So I felt very excited to watch this trailer and to participate in this event. I registered to take part in the event immediately after I learned about it.\" Although fans were hoping to find out more details about the new Star Wars film, it seems to have raised more questions than answers with Star Wars aficionados using social media to vent their theories about 'The Force Awakens'. All will become clear when the film hits cinemas in most countries internationally from December 16th. However, China will have to wait until the end of January 2016 to find out how the story unfolds.
