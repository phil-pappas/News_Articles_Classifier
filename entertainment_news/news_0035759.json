But as soon as his kennel is needed for a new dog , Jake's life will be over.\nHe's sad; it's as if he knows that the future doesn't hold much happiness in store for him. He lies in his kennel, stretched out on the concrete floor. His tail doesn't wag, and he knows that even if he gets up to greet visitors, they are not going to take him away from this grim place. So now he doesn't even bother to get up. If you watch his video , you see a dog who has stopped caring, a dog who is depressed and sad and lonely.\nJake is only five years old. He's listed as a Chow mix, but he could also be a Shepherd mix. He is larger than he looks in the picture -- 71 pounds. But the shelter thinks he might need to get his hormones checked as his extra weight might be from an endocrine disorder. But he is neutered and otherwise healthy (heartworm negative), so he is ready for an adopter.\nJake takes treats gently and gets along with other dogs. He is urgently in need of networking. Please share his story with friends and family to help Jake find rescue or an adoptive family. He can be killed at anytime. A foster offer could also save his life.\nIf you can rescue or adopt Jake, you must email rescuepets@hillsboroughcounty.org and rescuemetampa@yahoo.com by 9:00 am. Make the subject: Do Not Euth and include Jake's name and ID# A29736145 in the body of the email with your contact information. He must be picked up by 3:00 pm tomorrow. The volunteers ask that you do not email if you are not serious about rescuing him.\nThere is more information on Jake's Facebook thread . Jake is ID# A29736145. He is at the Hillsborough County Animal Services, 440 N. Falkenburg Road, Tampa, FL 33619. Their phone number is (813) 744-5660. The shelter is open every day from 10:00 am to 7:00 pm.\nFollow the Chicago Pets Examiner on Twitter and Facebook .", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/250846728289533/photos/a.972221026152096.1073742514.250846728289533/1091326127574918/?type=3", "https://www.facebook.com/100010467369108/videos/vb.100010467369108/115064422185803/?type=2&theater", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Chicago-Pets-Examiner/365410640319755?ref=hl", "http://twitter.com/#%21/pamkramer"], "published": "2015-10-24T02:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:39:37.177+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
