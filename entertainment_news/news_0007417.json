London is preparing for the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping, accompanied by his wife Peng Liyuan starting on Monday Oct. 19. By GREGORY KATZAssociated Press \nLONDON (AP) - Chinese President Xi Jinping is set to begin a four-day state visit to Britain on Monday as part of a push to increase trade ties between the two countries. \nXi and his wife Peng Liyuan will be hosted at Buckingham Palace by Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip and also receive an elaborate formal welcome and a carriage ride to the palace Tuesday. \nPrime Minister David Cameron told Chinese Central Television the visit heralds a \"golden era\" between the two countries. \n\"It's a real opportunity to deepen our relationship and I'm delighted President Xi is spending so much time here,\" Cameron said, adding that Chinese investment in major British infrastructure projects is generating jobs in Britain. \nThe elaborately choreographed visit will also include a trip to the Manchester City football training grounds and a possible unscripted side trip to a pub to dine on that English classic, fish and chips. \nThe Chinese president plans to address both houses of Parliament on Tuesday before an elaborate state banquet at the palace. \nProtests are expected throughout Xi's visit, which is scheduled to end Friday. \nBritish opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn has indicated a desire to discuss human rights with Xi when they meet at a palace banquet, but Chinese officials say they would be surprised if he raises the issue. \nProminent Chinese dissident Ai Weiwei, a frequent critic of Chinese policies, is having a major exhibit of his works close to the palace at the Royal Academy of Arts. \nThe visit has a serious agenda as both governments are anxious to strengthen business ties despite wide differences over human rights policy. It follows a high profile visit to China by Treasury chief George Osborne, who seeks more Chinese investment. \nThe two governments are already cooperating on nuclear power development, with China making a major investment in a new plant in southeast England. \nPrince William, who recently made an official visit to China, plans Monday to record a speech for broadcast on Chinese TV outlining the need to combat illegal wildlife trade.
