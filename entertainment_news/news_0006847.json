The film's music like \"Ruki ruki thi zindagi\" also became an instant hit.\nHowever, despite having a successful debut, Aftab could not establish a strong ground in Bollywood with flop films like 'Love Ke Liye Kuch Bhi Karega', 'Koi Mere Dil Se Poochhe' and 'Pyaasa'.\nAfter a low phase, Aftab hit the jackpot again with sex comedies 'Masti' and 'Kyaa Kool Hain Hum'. He is now awaiting the release of third instalment of the film -- 'Kyaa Kool Hain Hum 3'.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:26:18.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
