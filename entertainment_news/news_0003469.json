He is said to have replaced Dulquer who, with two Malayalam films in his kitty, couldn't find dates to allocate for this project,\" a source from the film's unit told IANS. \nInitially, Dulquer and Karthi were confirmed for the project, which was slated to go on the floors in December. \nHowever, it was a couple of weeks ago that Ratnam decided to delay the project as he planned to make it as a bilingual. \n\"Dulquer had set aside dates for Mani sir's film in December. But following the postponement of the project, he had no other option than walking out as he was getting offers from Malayalam filmdom,\" the source said. \nDulquer apparently walked out of Ratnam's project last week to make himself available for actor-filmmaker Pratap Pothen's next yet-untitled Malayalam film. \nThe film, which is said to be a revenge drama, also features Nithya Menon and Keerthy Suresh. \nThe source also added that Ratnam is on the lookout for a co-producer for the film's Telugu version, due to which the project is getting delayed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T09:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:36:53.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
