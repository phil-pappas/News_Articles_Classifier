Photo: Graham Tidy \nWine aficionados who eagerly await James Halliday's annual Wine Companion release each year must be getting used to seeing Western Australia dominate the wine landscape.\nHalliday, universally considered the leading wine critic in this country, spends four months a year tasting 80 wines a day for his Companion , fully immersing himself in the latest canvas of Australian wine.\nHis Companion is the wine industry's very own Bible, listing the year's top wines, best new wineries, dark horses to watch and a comprehensive wrap of 1317 wineries and tasting notes on almost 4000 wines.\nVasse Felix in Margaret River, the region's first winery.\nDrilling down into the detail, it's clear once again that WA is the standout region in Australia for producing consistent, high-quality wine.\nAdvertisement See lists highlighting Halliday's top WA wines and wineries and share your comments below. \nWA's percentage of wine production is very small in terms of volume (in the context of Australia) but very big in price and quality. Margaret River, for example, produces only five percent of Australia's premium wine but is responsible for about 20 per cent of premium sales.\nWill Berliner from Cloudburst is shaking things up in Margaret River. Photo: Supplied \nExamining the ratings in the Companion , 19 of Australia's very best wineries are from WA, while 14 wines from the west were awarded the highest points for their particular category/variety.\nSo why is this happening? Apart from recording excellent vintages in all nine of our official wine regions since about 2007 (for both reds and whites), WA is a huge area with a very diverse climate. \nWe have the Swan Valley, the hottest growing wine region in Australia, the Great Southern (one of the coolest), and every point in between. \nAnd then there's the jewel in the crown – Margaret River – which in the past decade has become the most important wine region in the country and the one that best mirrors the famed Bordeaux region in France because of its proximity to the ocean (and subsequent maritime climate) and fantastic terroir.\nIt was WA scientist Dr John Gladstones who revealed in a research paper in 1965 that Margaret River was a prime grape-growing region, prompting many a rich doctor to buy up and plant vines there (his report led Dr Tom Cullity to establish Vasse Felix in 1967, the region's first vineyard and winery, and he was followed quickly by others).\nIn this year's Companion , Margaret River has 14 of the top 32 cabernets, putting to rest any notion that Coonawarra in South Australia was still the premier region for this grape.\nMargaret River chardonnay also dominates, with eight out of the top 30, along with Victoria's Yarra Valley (note the 2013 Deep Woods Estate Reserve from Margaret River was the only chardonnay with 98 points).  \nAlthough equal top with the Yarra Valley, Margaret River has consistently produced better chardonnay than the Yarra over the past five years, according to Halliday.\nAnd when it comes to that massively-scented white blend of semillon and sauvignon blanc, Margaret River is the only conversation worth having, being absolutely dominant in this instance, with seven out of the top 10 SSB/SBS blends. No other region comes even close.\nEven riesling has risen to the top in WA and now has the upper hand over the rest of the country.\nWhile Clare Valley in SA has historically been regarded as the best region in Australia for riesling, the Great Southern – headed by the subregions of Porongurup and Mount Barker – is challenging it, with six of the best 17 rieslings compared to three from the Clare.\nWhen it comes to the new kids on the block in the west, no one has made more of a splash than Californian Will Berliner's fully organic venture Cloudbreak in Margaret River.\nWith wines starting at $200 you might wonder why... but his biodynamic wines are truly ethereal and made with unblinking passion, challenging neighbours Moss Wood and Cullen as the very best cabernet in the land.\nWhen it comes to value, wineries in the west also shine.\nWest Cape Howe was awarded Halliday's best-value winery, with five wines between $19 and $30 earning 95 or 96 points, a huge achievement and one we'll talk about in a few weeks.\nMandoon Estate, whose cellar door and expansive premises owner Alan Erceg has turned into a major tourism drawcard in the Swan Valley, again fares well. Led by winemaker Ryan Sudano, Mandoon has seven wines rated between 95 and 97 points, with all but two wines less than $33.\nAnd Larry Cherubino, arguably the state's most travelled winemaker and whose winery won Halliday's winery of the year in 2011, is not far from the top again, with 20 of his 27 wines receiving Halliday's 'value' symbol in the Companion , and 12 wines rated between 95 and 98 points.\nI think it's time we raised a glass to the west this weekend, if you haven't already.\nTop Great Southern rieslings: \n97pts \n2014 Willoughby Park Kalgan Ironrock\n2014 Alkoomi Black Label\n2014 Frankland Estate Isolation Ridge Vineyard\n2014 Forest Hill Vineyard Block 1\n2008 Abbey Creek Vineyard Museum Release\n2014 Duke's Vineyard Magpie Hill Reserve\nTop Margaret River cabernets: \n98pts \n2012 Cape Mentelle\n2011 Devil's Lair 9th Chamber\n2012 Domaine Naturaliste Rebus\n2013 Flying Fish Cove Prize Catch\n2012 Xanadu Reserve\n97pts \n2013 Deep Woods Estate Reserve\n2012 Deep Woods Wilyabrup\n2011 Flowstone Queen of the Earth\n2009 Heydon Estate W.G.
