Courtesy Three Laramie breweries will come together next week for the first-ever Oktoberfest for the Gem City.John Guerin, owner of Laramie brewery and coffeehouse Coal Creek Tap, said he and two friends had decided about a year ago to bring a traditional German beer festival to Laramie.And the Oktoberfest - which takes its name from a traditional, \"really drinkable\" amber lager brewed in the fall to celebrate the season - takes place Oct. 1 from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. at Laramie's historic train depot.Along with Coal Creek Tap, Altitude Chophouse and Sheep Mountain Brewery will participate in the festival. Guerin said this is a good opportunity to get the breweries together and celebrate the Laramie brewing scene.There will be a \"beer Olympics,\" Guerin said, which will involve physical and educational challenges. German-style food will be served. Jason Shogren, who recently hosted the Centennial Uptown Breakdown, will also be performing during the four-hour event.Guerin has been brewing beer for 20 years, but just opened Coal Creek last year, he said.\"In Wyoming, the craft brewing has grown into 20-plus breweries,\" Guerin said. \"Laramie is the third largest city in the state, but has the most breweries.\"There are four breweries in Laramie, Guerin said, but one chose not to participate in this year's festival.
