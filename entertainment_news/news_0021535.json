Boyz II Men. \nBoyz II Men \nLuna Park Big Top, October 10 \nReviewed by Rachel Olding \n★★★ \nAdvertisement Save the predictable jokes about the boyz becoming men.\nYes, they are definitely men. Fourteen years after their first number-one sensation, End of the Road , the boyz are now in their 40s and the suave dance moves don't come quite so easy.\nBut the real question is, will we get the boyz or the men in their string of Australian shows?\nIt was definitely the former when the trio took to the stage in a glorious blaze of flashback reels, smoke machines and Motown Philly dance movies.\nThis was the old-school Boyz II Men we were after and they weren't going to change a damn thing.\nThe classic a capella harmonies came out straight away in It's So Hard to Say Goodbye and the co-ordinated '90s R&B dance moves in Motown Philly . Time has not wearied their voices – baritone Nathan Morris still oozed like caramel, Shawn Stockman and Wanya Morris were still deliciously smooth.\nBut we were barely into the Four Seasons of Loneliness when things took a southward turn and the boyz gave way to wearied, confused, overblown men.\nThe turning point was a bizarre medley of poorly done covers – Bob Marley's Jammin' , Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit and Lenny Kravitz's American Woman – that suddenly turned a raucous '90s flashback into a bad casino karaoke show.\nThey struggled from there. The sound became louder but muddier and the harmonies lost their punch. As the trio tried harder and harder to re-imagine big-hitting ballads, it turned into cringe-worthy overkill.\nOpen Arms (with Wanya Morris up on a table belting out the chorus) and I'll Make Love To You (with the three men handing out dozens of long-stem roses to the crowd) were always going to be crowd pleasers but the harmonies had frayed and were losing traction.\nBy the time they dared to perform Losing Sleep , a Justin Timberlake-esque single from their latest album Collide , people were leaving the venue.\nLuckily, they veered back into boyz territory at the end and won the crowd back with an End of the Road sing-a-long and wild Motown Philly party.\nThe group, who have never really stopped performing since the '90s, have just re-signed for another two-year residency at a Las Vegas casino and it felt like we got the cheesy casino show too.\nTheir mistake was trying too hard and changing it up too much when all we wanted was the boyz and their hits.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T05:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:11:34.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
