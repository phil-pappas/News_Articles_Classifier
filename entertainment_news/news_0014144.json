Soon-to-be NIDA graduates showcase their talents in new theatre production Stranger I Am - the story of a young woman Aimee, who goes on a journey of self-discovery following the death of her mother.

Photo: Edwina Pickles \n\"It's certainly not your regular everyday narrative, but it's been an amazing opportunity to perform new, original work which is something that as a student you don't usually get the chance to do,\" Cole says.\nThird-year design for performance student Jonathan Hindmarsh is also graduating this year, and has created the play's costumes.\n\"I created two costumes for Aimee to represent the two different worlds she goes through – there's the external world which is full of clean, elegant lines, and the broken-down, internal world she goes into and that costume reflects the fragmentation of her mind,\" he says.\nAlthough NIDA is widely recognised as the most prestigious performing arts school in Australia, the acting and performance design fields are notoriously difficult to break into, and both Cole and Hindmarsh remain cautious in their expectations for the future.\n\"From here, hopefully I'll get an agent, build contacts and keep myself busy – the good thing about NIDA is that it's prepared us to create our own work because it can be so hard to find work in this industry,\" Cole says.\nHindmarsh says while being a NIDA graduate is something he'll always treasure, it's only the first stepping stone of many in what he hopes will be a successful career.\n\"I don't think being a NIDA graduate is anything I can coast on – it's now up to me to get out there and actually prove that I have what it takes to be an interesting and challenging designer,\" he says.\nStranger I Am  runs from October 16-23.
