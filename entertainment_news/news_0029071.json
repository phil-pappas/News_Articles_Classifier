By Luke Karmali \nTreyarch has discussed the future of the Black Ops branch of the Call of Duty franchise, and whether or not the studio would contemplate returning to a World War setting. \nSpeaking to IGN, Black Ops III director of campaign and zombies Jason Blundell explained that while the ending of Black Ops III won't be as open as that of Black Ops II, he does believe there are more stories to tell in the universe. Got feedback on our player? We want to hear it. \n\"We had multiple stories at the end of Black Ops II and people had different outcomes. Then we kind of picked an idea and that kind of connect into Black Ops III – I’ll leave that mysterious! But the end of Black Ops… hmmm… here’s the thing, I think there’s always stories to be told. One guy asked me if we were going to keep going into the future but the point is there are always stories to be told. That could be the future, that could be the past. \n\"This one had to be future-based for us because there was always a key idea. The first one was man corrupts man – Viktor Reznov corrupts Alex Mason. The second one was man corrupts machine – Raul Menendez taking the drones. Then this one is machine corrupts machine. So it was really an arc of thought. I don’t see there being an end because, like I said earlier, Black Ops has always been stories about people. That’s infinite. You can tell so many different stories, and they can come from the past, the future, or wherever you want. \n\"People ask about World War II – and I’ve done my fair share of World War 2 shooters – I’d do it again, but I’d have to have something new to say about it. Either about the war or people in the war. It’s not a case of doing it just because it’s been a while - it’s what am I saying that World War II helps me to say.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:24:23.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
