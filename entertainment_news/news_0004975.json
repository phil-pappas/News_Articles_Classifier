Before long, half the audience was crying with her,” the witness, identified as maxnix, wrote in on an online music forum.\nThe Internet user said the items also included a shirt Smith wore on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine and a T-shirt with the image of Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards in which she was frequently photographed.\nA 1979 article in the Chicago Tribune said that Smith’s Ryder rental truck was stolen from outside a Holiday Inn hotel after she played a show at the Aragon Ballroom, still a prominent music venue.\nThe article said that the stolen goods included guitars, amplifiers and other items worth $40,000, which would be more than $130,000 in 2015 money.\nMonday, the Tribune said that the fan who returned Smith’s items at the reading, which took place Sunday, explained that she came into possession of them decades ago through a friend of her then-roommate who was working for U-Haul, a different rental car company.\nThe woman, Noreen Bender, said that she had long sought to return the items to Smith but could not figure out how, believing it was inappropriate to throw them on stage at a concert.\n“The feeling of making your hero happy, it was a moment. It was the highlight of my life,” Bender told the newspaper.\nSmith’s new book “M Train” is largely about her journey through memories and explores her brother’s death.\nThe book follows Smith’s 2010 memoir “Just Kids,” a bittersweet account of her relationship with late avant-garde photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, which won the National Book Award for Nonfiction.\nOften described as the godmother of punk, Smith is touring to promote her book and to mark the 40th anniversary of her influential album “Horses.”", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:50:31.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
