Launching the automation of Fair Price Shop here, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said, these shops would be linked to the ‘Food Net’ programme, under which, entire details right from sowing of seeds by the farmers to the storage of produce would be recorded, thus leaving no space for its diversion. ”The aim of automation of Fair Price Shop is to ensure the distribution of ration to the real beneficiaries under the Food Security Act in a transparent manner,” the Chief Minister said. (Also Read: Devendra Fadnavis asked to provide security to Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri in Mumbai) Fair Price Shops would be provided with Point Sales Device (POSD), having biometric system allowing the real beneficiary to get ration without any delay. The POSD would also generate electronic slip mentioning details of the beneficiaries, like rate and quantity of ration delivered. Thereafter, the beneficiary would receive an SMS alert within two minutes, he said. The programme would initially be implemented in five districts of Panchkula, Ambala, Yamunanagar, Karnal and Panipat and based on its success would be rolled out in the entire state by March 31, 2016, Khattar said. On this occasion, the Chief Minister distributed 25 kg wheat, two kg sugar and seven litres of kerosene oil to five beneficiaries of Panchkula under the Public Distribution System by using POSD. Addressing the programme, Khattar said this day was an important day for good governance, which was launched in the state on December 25, 2014, the birthday of former Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee. To ensure good governance, Haryana government has started a number of IT programmes, like CM Window, 24×7 Harsamay Portal of Police Department, he said, adding the aim was to ensure that the last beneficiary in the row gets the benefit through end-to-end computerisation. Referring to the Digital India programme launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Khattar said, Haryana Government has succeeded in keeping a tab on the corruption in the state. The state government has also decided to disburse the social security pension in the State directly into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries, he said. Presently there are 22 lakh beneficiaries, out of which bank accounts of 14 lakh people have been opened and they are getting pensions directly into their accounts, he said. \nModified Date: October 9, 2015 8:47 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:17:24.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
