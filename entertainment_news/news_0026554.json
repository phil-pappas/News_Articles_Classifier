For me, being a gentleman is more of the person being caring,” he said.\nModel-actor Victor Basa believes a gentleman should “know how to walk on the right side of the sidewalk” and, funny enough, should “know how to tie a tie.”\nTested?\nThey say a true gentleman would not engage in bad behavior. Have they been in a situation where they chose to err, we asked.\n“Of course, many times. ’Cause we’re just human beings. Things happen,” Frank said.\n“I’m sure there have been a few times,” Bamboo added.\nFabio admitted he’s not perfect either but he always tries to keep himself in check. “Sometimes all it needs is for one to recall proper values,” he said.\nVictor shared he sometimes gets stuck doing nothing where it is expected or appropriate. He recalled a bus ride to Ilocos where he saw this woman looking for a seat. “I was like, ‘How many hours is this trip? Should I offer my seat?’ I was thinking and thinking until finally I told myself, ‘Okay I’m gonna offer my seat.’ But somebody already offered her one.”\nGentlemen’s creed\nGiven the chance to create a guideline for a gentleman, Bamboo said it should, first and foremost, include the tenet “listen and learn.”\nFor Fabio, the most important thing to put in there should be “observe proper decorum” and the concept of “delicadeza.”\nFrank added the doctrine should also include the line “respect yourself and respect your neighbor.”\nVictor would go for subtlety. “Because you don’t want to be ostentatious, you don’t wanna be obnoxious. If you’re a true gentleman you don’t find the need to prove anything,” he explained.\n‘Amoy gwapo’\nBeing the latest ambassadors of a body spray brand, we asked Bamboo, Frank, Victor and Fabio what they think of “amoy gwapo.”\nFor Bamboo, a scent is the “extra layer” one puts on to add to one’s confidence.\nFrank Magalona, Fabio Ide and Victor Basa\n“Sometimes the smallest thing is what catches people’s attention. So a scent is like a ‘calling card.’ I want to smell good because first impression lasts,” the 37-year-old singer songwriter said.\nFrank believes it is important because one’s body is a “temple” and it deserves proper attention. Victor thinks smelling good is necessary especially in his line of work.\n“I just really like smelling good, even when I was a kid. It’s nice to hear that people appreciate you because of being mabango…” Fabio said.\nPick and choose\nWhen connecting with a girl, which of these do they consider most helpful: good looks, talent, or sense of humor?\nIt’s none of the above for Bamboo. He said, “Making a connection is not about you, it’s about the other person. Everything should come automatically after. Like, after you establish a connection, you already look good to him or her. You’re already funny. So, to me it’s about knowing the other person, their spirit, their character, then getting in rhythm with that.”\nFabio chose sense of humor. “I’m a happy person and I love people that bring positivity, too.”\nVictor thinks so, too, “(Because) if you take everything too seriously, that would be sad,” he said.\nFrank picked talent believing “it’s much more substantial than looks and sense of humor.”", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:56:11.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
