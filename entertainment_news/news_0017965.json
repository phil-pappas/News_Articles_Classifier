Paul O’Grady and Cilla Black (Yui Mok/PA) \n“There’s a book there with me and Cilla, there’s probably a couple. If I do write another memoir I will intertwine that with Cilla,” he said. \n“We had so many laughs. We had such a good time. Me and Cilla always got into trouble and I always got the blame!” \n“She wasn’t scared of anything and she was up for anything. I used to take her to these dog-rough Puerto Rican clubs in New York, where the taxi driver would say, ‘Are you sure you want me to drop you off here?’ But they played fabulous music. \n“I’d say to Cilla, ‘Give us your jewellery’, so off would come the diamond ring and the necklace, I’d put them in my pocket and then we’d go in and have a ball! Paul wants to write about Cilla (Steve Parsons/PA) \n“They were working class clubs but there was never any trouble, even though they’d be in the parts of town where you wouldn’t dare tread. But she would always say she felt safe with me.” Promoted stories \nPaul – who has kept in touch with her sons, Robert, Ben and Jack – said he would probably get their blessing. \n“Well, they know with me, she’d be safe. They’d rather me do it than anyone else. It would just be about two people having fun and what we got up to.” \nHe continued: “I’ve got a great memory for conversations and situations. People say my memory’s scary. There’s loads of material. I would never be disrespectful to her.” Jackie Collins (John Stillwell/PA) \nPaul, who has released his fourth memoir Open The Cage, Murphy, said he is still in disbelief about Cilla’s death, as well as the death of Jackie Collins, who died from breast cancer at her Californian home on September 19. She was aged 77. \n“What with Cilla going and then Jackie, I’m just hanging on in there. The effect has been terrible, shocking,” the entertainer admitted. \n“I still haven’t got to grips with Cilla going. When I came back from Borneo, I said, ‘I must ring Cilla’, and then I thought, ‘What am I talking about?’ You just forget they’re not there any more. And I only spoke to Jackie just before I went. \n“It hasn’t really sunk in. I haven’t had time to breathe, because we were haring around Borneo with all manner of critters. I haven’t had time to sit and dwell on it.” Paul O’Grady (John Stillwell/PA) \nPaul has thrown himself into work to cope with his loss. His trip to the rainforests of Borneo, where he befriended orangutans, was for a new series of ITV’s Animal Orphans. \n“Work always helps,” he said. “It takes your mind off everything. \n“I’m a great believer in that. When you’re working, you’re preoccupied, so you have to focus all your attention on your work and you forget everything else for a few hours.” Share article \nOpen The Cage, Murphy by Paul O’Grady is out now.
