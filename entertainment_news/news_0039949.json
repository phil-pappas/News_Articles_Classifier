The Washington Post reporter and former Warrenville resident has been detained in Iran for more than a year on charges of espionage.\nNow the friends are waiting to see what the verdict actually is and what it will mean for Rezaian. So far Iranian officials have been silent on any court ruling, and the U.S. government has said it has not received an official ruling.\nSince the end of summer, Stetler said he's had a gut feeling the Iranian government was going to convict Rezaian. He and Brandseth spent the first two years of high school with Rezaian at Wheaton Central High School, which has since become Wheaton-Warrenville South High School.\n\"This is something I'd been expecting because this whole thing has been nothing more than a farce, a show trial,\" Stetler said of his friend's ordeal. Rezaian moved to Warrenville from San Francisco in 1991.\nRezaian was arrested July 22, 2014, by the Iranian government and charged with espionage and three other crimes. The hard-line Iranian government claims Rezaian's work as a reporter jeopardized their national security. Rezaian, who is of Iranian decent, has remained in custody since his arrest.\nIran's judiciary spokesman confirmed the verdict on state TV Sunday, saying the ruling is eligible for appeal within 20 days, but gave no indication of what punishment the 39-year-old could face. He reportedly faces up to 20 years in prison.\nBrother of Washington Post journalist condemns 'cruel' detention in Iran Tribune wire reports The brother of Jason Rezaian, the Washington Post journalist detained in Iran and convicted in secret, described his brother's imprisonment as \"cruel and inhumane\" Tuesday and called on the U.S. government to take \"any appropriate actions\" to win his freedom.\nAli Rezaian told The Associated Press...\nThe brother of Jason Rezaian, the Washington Post journalist detained in Iran and convicted in secret, described his brother's imprisonment as \"cruel and inhumane\" Tuesday and called on the U.S. government to take \"any appropriate actions\" to win his freedom.\nAli Rezaian told The Associated Press...\n(Tribune wire reports) Brandseth and Stetler both said they believe politics is playing a big role in what Rezaian's sentence will be – if there is one. Brandseth said the whole process since Rezaian's arrest has been \"bizarre\" and \"ludicrous.\"\n\"They arrest him but didn't release the charges. They denied him his choice of representation. They implied espionage but provided no credible evidence. They hold him longer than Iranian law allows but don't acknowledge the violation. They announce there's a verdict but don't say what it is. They announce a conviction but they don't say of what he's convicted,\" Brandseth said. \"It all feels like it's designed to frustrate and pressure a third party in some internal struggle.\"\nStetler likewise believes Rezaian is a pawn of politics between the United States and Iran. He speculated his incarceration is related to the latest nuclear deal or with a possible prisoner exchange.\nDavid Stetler, Brian's father who fondly remembers the friendship his son had with Rezaian, is also skeptical. He questioned whether or not there is a real sentence, or if Rezaian is a pawn in the game of politics.\nThe vile jailers of journalists Editorial Board When he gained power in 2012 after the downfall of Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak, it looked as though Mohammed Morsi might end the government's history of silencing independent voices in the press. It was a mistaken hope.

It was a mistaken hope. Under the Muslim Brotherhood-dominated administration, prosecutors soon...\n(Editorial Board) \"It appears more and more that he's being used a bit as a political chip in a bigger picture. To think a reporter with the Washington Post would be a spy is objectively preposterous,\" the elder Stetler said.\nStetler added that he was disappointed U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry wasn't making more of a public outcry about Rezaian's incarceration. So far, Stetler said he's seen little reaction from the State Department and is hoping there are back channel communications happening – something the younger Stetler is also hoping.\n\"I'm still very hopeful that due to politics he will be released soon. I have faith in our government,\" the younger Stetler said.\nKerry said Tuesday that the administration is tracking extremely closely the news coming out of Iran about Rezaian and called on Iran to release the detained Americans, drop all the charges, and allow them to be reunited with their families. But he defended the U.S. strategy of not linking their fate to the recent nuclear negotiations and said that the families knew why it was important to not to hold the agreement hostage.\nThroughout the period of Rezaian's incarceration, Stetler and Brandseth have taken to social media to keep friends and family abreast of what was going on in Iran. During the past 14 months of Rezaian's incarceration, Stetler said he has reconnected with some of the trio's old high school friends who are sharing the plight on their social media feeds.\n\"Now more people we went to high school with in Wheaton are aware of the situation,\" Stetler said.\nIf Rezaian, who holds dual U.S. and Iranian citizenship is released, none of his friends know what he might want to do in regards to returning to the United States. Rezaian is married to an Iranian woman, Yeganeh Salehi, a reporter for The National newspaper in Abu Dhabi, who also was incarcerated and still faces pending charges. If Rezaian returned to the U.S., Stetler said it was doubtful he would settle in the Wheaton area, but he at least hopes his old friend will return briefly to the area to seek comfort in old friendships.\n\"We'll see him again. I'm hoping something good will happen by the new year,\" Stetler said.\nAlex Keown is a freelance reporter.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n Iran Middle East", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-55e4c8f1/turbine/ct-egypt-journalists-repression-edit-0901-20150831", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561e95b9/turbine/ct-wht-wheaton-central-grad-jason-resaian-tl-1022-20151014", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561d405b/turbine/ct-washington-post-reporter-jason-rezaian-iran-20151013"], "published": "2015-10-14T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:31:05.804+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
