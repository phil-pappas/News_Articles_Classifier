Researchers say that so-called, ‘postcoital dysphoria’ or feeling low after consensual sex not necessarily be medical problem. Lead author Robert D Schweitzer of Queensland University of Technology in Kelvin Grove, Australia said that it is a human experience on the intercourse one can have. The survey was conducted across 230 female university students who answered questions on sexual function, experiences in close relationships, psychological and emotional experiences while having and after sex.

While just 2 per cent experienced sadness most or all of the time. Most with such experiences have increased over time when compared to previous studies as postcoital dysphoria is still under-recognized and under-researched. Survey suggests say that postcoital dysphoria could have a genetic component as mostly identical twins and breastfeeding developed this feeling. Although age and relationship were not a part of it, people who have experienced child sex abuse or bad adult sexual experiences in the past majorly experienced it. Recent events of stress could also be the result. \n  4:17 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T13:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T15:30:08.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
