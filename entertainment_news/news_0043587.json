I was having a lot of troubles with cocaine… I was hanging out with some pretty rough characters. I was scared to go to school (because) one of them wanted to kill me. I wanted to get out of there,” Black was quoted as saying by Parade magazine, reports aceshowbiz.com. \nJack’s parents enrolled him in Poseidon, a private school which was infamously known for “troubled youth”. ”Most of the other kids there were expelled from other schools, but I went voluntarily,” he said. ”It was a place to press the restart button.” \nThe 46-year-old actor felt like he had no one to turn to. He couldn’t tell his parents as he’s afraid if he would make them totally upset. “Being raised a Jew, I didn’t have any kind of confessional. I couldn’t talk to my parents about the things that I was most guilty about,” he said. \n“My dad loved me very much, but I needed someone who wasn’t judgmental at all, who wasn’t going to be disappointed with me.” \nModified Date: October 11, 2015 3:19 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:11:34.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
