Unfortunately the Roadrunners fell agonizingly short as they fell to Louisiana Tech 34-31.\nDalton Strum came in due to an injury and he impressed, equaling a school record as he made four touchdown passes. But that didn’t matter as LA Tech wrapped up the game thanks to a field goal with 10 seconds to play to silence the Alamodome.\nSturm managed to go 18-of-27 on the night with 227 yards in the air as part of his four touchdowns. Sturm also worked well with carries as he managed 34 yards on the ground in an impressive showing to give UTSA hope for the future.\nDavid Morgan II was the main target for Sturm as he managed nine catches, tying his own shared program record, with 85-yards and two touchdowns. JaBryce Taylor was agonizingly short of managing 100 yards as he managed 99 yards along with his two touchdown receptions.\nThe first 20 points of the game all came from turnovers as both sides struggled to keep hold of the ball. A pick-six allowed the Bulldogs to open the scoring as they took advantage of some early nerves from Sturm, which was followed by a 19 yard field goal after a second interception.\nUTSA responded with Trevor Baker and Michael Egwuagu making interceptions, with the first score being from a 25-yard Daniel Portillo field goal. The second set up Morgan’s first touchdown reception, this one from ten yards to make it 10-10.\nTwo touchdowns allowed the Bulldogs to restore the lead, and they managed to just get a score before losing possession at the end of the half. With eight seconds to play Jeff Driskel managed a two yard scoring pass to Jarred Craft to make it 24-10 at the main break.\nOn the opening drive of the second half, UTSA pulled back the deficit, making it just a one score game again. The touchdown came from a 38-yard pass, at fourth and five, finding Taylor to make it 24-17.\nBut the Bulldogs refused to lay down and the next score went to the visitors after an eight play 71 yard drive. Ricky Jones finished things off with a quick three yard run to push it back to a two score game.\nAgain the Roadrunners hit back as they took a longer drive, 11-plays and 60 yards, with Sturm managing five passes. The final pass was a perfect ball to Morgan, the second time the two had linked up for seven points.\nUTSA started the fourth with another score, which levelled the scores and saw momentum continue to go to the Roadrunners. It was a quick drive, taking just five plays, capped by Sturm finding Taylor with a 57 yard slant pass with 13:38 on the clock to tie things at 31.\nDespite having the momentum the Roadrunners were forced to punt on their next two plays which was making the fans nervous. The Bulldogs wore down the clock before there were 10 seconds to play when they managed the 22 yard field goal to win the game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:06:51.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
