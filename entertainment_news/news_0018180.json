She was 71. \nBorn in Winthrop, Mass., Woodell played the brunette brainiac Bobbie Jo on the first two seasons of Petticoat Junction, which aired on CBS from 1963 to 1970. She left the show because she wanted to focus on her singing, and was replaced by Lori Saunders. Woodell went on to tour with comedian Jack Benny, and performed on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964 with the Ladybugs, a take on The Beatles that featured Woodell and her onscreen sisters, Linda Kaye and Jeannine Riley. \nShe also starred in movies including Twilight People and The Big Doll House , before she retired from acting in the mid-1970s and went on to co-found a consulting firm. \nWoodell is survived by her husband, Vern McDade. \nOther Links From TVGuide.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T23:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:17:23.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
