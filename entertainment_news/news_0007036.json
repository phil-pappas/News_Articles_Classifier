Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford attending the Olivier Awards at the Royal Opera House in 2015 (Ian West/Press Association) \n“It was a very funny situation and I was served up the most pretentious thing,” the This Morning presenter explained. “It wasn’t in normal circumstances and I had to guess what was in my mouth and I panicked a bit. \n“What was in my mouth foamed up slightly and I spat it out. Anyway, we were basically thrown out because of that. It was haute cuisine and I don’t know why I (spat it out).” \nHis wife Ruth Langsford added: “They weren’t very happy with us.” \nHowever, Eamonn continued: “But come on, I just wanted to stop and say ‘Are you kidding here?’. The amount was thousands of pounds for a melt in the mouth thing and I really just thought ‘Get over yourself’. How can you, in a real world, say that this is somehow worthwhile doing?” Promoted stories \nAs part of the series, the presenting couple got to sample what it is like to be super-wealthy as they travelled all over the world meeting billionaires who own £2 million watches, fly via private jet at a cost of £10,000 a trip and will pay £100,000 just to secure a table at the most exclusive clubs in Ibiza. \n“We genuinely thought we were embarking on a mission to meet a series of knobs,” said Holmes, of meeting wealthy oligarchs from all over the world. \n“You just thought they would be flash, bling, stupid, undeserving – whatever. And just time after time after time, people just won us over with their charm and their respect and their dedication.” \nOn his own spending habits, he revealed he has “a big conscience” about his own money and that because both he and Langsford are from “a working-class family”, they “can’t get away with too much bling”. Eamonn Holmes (Anthony Devlin/PA) \n“As your earnings go up, you run out of friends,” he said. “Because you run out of people to share it with. It’s alright saying ‘We can afford a weekend here’, but so few people around you can. \n“I went through a stage where I used to pay for everybody: ‘Come on, come with us – I’ll pay for it’. \n“Then I realised people really didn’t admire you for that, they actually resented you a bit for it. And you sort of find your own level and you realise the more wealth you get is a difficult thing to balance.” Share article \nEamonn & Ruth: How the Other Half Lives airs Thursday October 27 at 9pm on Channel 5.
