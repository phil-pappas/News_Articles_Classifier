Named for Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist Eddie Adams, the workshop brings together top professional photographers and 100 carefully selected student photographers. The event has come to be recognized as the premiere photojournalist workshop, and its alumni have gone on to become Pulitzer Prize-winning photographers themselves. The workshop is free to students who are chosen based on the merit of their portfolios. As the official tripod sponsor, Vanguard is proud to support the talented students and professional photographers in attendance at The Eddie Adams Workshop. Committed to students of photography, Vanguard is honored to support The Eddie Adams Workshop and the invaluable service it has provided to the photography community for more than 25 years. Renowned for portraits of celebrities and politicians and for coverage of 13 wars, Eddie Adams won the Pulitzer Prize in 1969, along with 500 other awards, including three George Polk Awards for News Photography, among others. In 1988, Eddie and his wife Alyssa set out to create a “foto farm” where young photojournalism students could meet and learn from their idols. From 1988 until today, The Eddie Adams Workshop has attracted top professionals and students to upstate New York to emerge refreshed and inspired. Vanguard is proud to play a part in allowing these students to benefit from this legendary event, tuition-free.\nVanguard is dedicated to photographic education: earlier in 2015, Vanguard launched Vanguard Academy, an EDU purchasing program for students and educators at collegiate and high school programs. “Vanguard believes it is essential to support the next generation of photographers and designers,” stated Doug Feldner, Director of Sales and Marketing for Vanguard. He added: “We have filled the ranks of our Vanguard Professional team with some of the brightest young photographers in the world and are constantly amazed at how they push the limits of creativity.” In addition to designing full-featured and high quality products for photographers and designers, Vanguard product price points are ideal for the academic community. With this program, authorized retail dealers can offer Vanguard products to students and educators at special discounted education price. Vanguard Academy is another way Vanguard seeks to enrich the photographic community and support young, aspiring photographers.\nAbout VANGUARD\nSince 1986, VANGUARD has been one of the global leaders in photo/video and outdoor accessories, including tripods , camera bags and optics .
