Not sure who they could trust, the survivors found themselves being pushed apart as some of them craved a safe haven whilst others didn’t trust their new friends. \nThe season culminated in Morgan (Lennie James) arriving at Alexandria just in time to see Rick killing one of the residents in a violent fight. \nThe first episode of the season is First Time Again. Rick and the group are still having trouble assimilating into Alexandria. Will a new threat bring them closer together or drive them further apart? \nTune in to FOX at 9pm on Monday 12th October to see the episode.
