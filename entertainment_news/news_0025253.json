The winner receives bragging rights and the title of Best in Brew. \nAlso competing will be BEX Coffee, Methodical Coffee, the Village Grind, Moe Joe's, the Forest Coffeehouse, and the Exchange. \nThe event is part of Travelers Rest's Harvest Market, and it goes on from 6 to 8 p.m. Thursday at Trailblazer Park. The cost is $8 to sample each brew and cast a vote. \nVisit www.travelersrestfarmersmarket.com for more info.
