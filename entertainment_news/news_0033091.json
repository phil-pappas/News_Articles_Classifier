Kennedy , one of the nation's leading political voices on mental illness, addiction, and other brain diseases, will discuss the progress made and major challenges ahead for their care and treatment—the subject of his new book A COMMON STRUGGLE --on November 5 at the National Press Club. Mr. Kennedy represented the state of Rhode Island for 16 years and fought a national battle to end medical and societal discrimination against mental illness, addiction, and other brain diseases-- highlighted by his lead sponsorship of the Mental Health Parity and Addictions Equity Act of 2008, and his brave openness about his own health challenges.

And this fall, Mr. Kennedy is leading a coalition to mount a grassroots campaign to make mental health and addiction top domestic priorities in the 2016 election.\nThis Newsmakers news conference is scheduled for Thursday, November 5 at 9:30 a.m. in the club's Fourth Estate Restaurant on the 13th Floor of the National Press Building at 529 14th St., NW, Washington, D.C. \nLike all Newsmakers events, this news conference is open to credentialed media and NPC members, free of charge.
