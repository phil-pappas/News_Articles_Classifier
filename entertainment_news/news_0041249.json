(AP) - New Hampshire Fish and Game officers say an app used by three teenage hikers sent them to the wrong parking lot and trails on Rattlesnake Mountain in Rumney, leading them to call for help when they got lost.\nOfficers say instead of taking the main trail on Sunday, the three bushwhacked through the woods in an attempt to reach the summit. Eventually, the terrain became too steep and it got dark.\nRescuers descended cliffs off-trail in the darkness to reach the 18-year-old hikers, identified as Haley Whitehouse of Somersworth, New Hampshire; Baily Ryan of Middlebury, Vermont, and Allison White of Weybridge, Vermont.\nThe hikers were helped down the mountain, reaching the trailhead at 8:30 p.m.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
