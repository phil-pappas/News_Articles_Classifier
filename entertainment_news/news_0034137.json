The Astros have the chance to close out this series here today with a win, but the Royals will be going all out to level the series up again to take this all the way to a decisive Game 5. \nComing in Game 4 of this MLB Playoffs series the Astros lead 2-1, and have home field advantage. However, if they do not grab their chance to end things today then the Royals can look forward to taking this series back to Kansas City for the winner takes all Game 5 scheduled for Wednesday. \nToday's game will have an opening pitch at 1.07 p.m. ET, with live coverage available on FS1. The game can also be watched online with a live stream link (details below). \nThe Astros claimed Game 3 on Sunday night in a 4-2 win at Minute Maid Park, bouncing back well from going behind in the fourth inning, to hit a stream of runs through the fifth to seventh innings. Despite a late rally from the Royals in the ninth, the Astros were able to close out the game and move to within just one more win from the AL Championship Series. \nGame 4's pitching match up will see Lance McCullers for the Astros face off against Yordano Ventura or the Royals. \nMcCullers went 6-7 on a 3.22 ERA this season with 129 strikeouts. In comparison, Ventura went 13-8 with a 4.08 ERA and 156 strikeouts. \nVentura will be hoping to keep the Royals postseason ambitions alive for one more game, but will have to stand up to the pressure from a hostile Houston crowd at Minute Maid Park today. \nGame 4 between the Royals and Astros starts at 1.07 p.m. ET and can be watched through live stream by clicking here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:22:02.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
