(Photo: Amanda J. Cain / Special to The Detroit News) \nCONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE From the outside, the plain and sign-less facade of the Marble Bar may lead one to believe this is the wrong address for Detroit’s newest bar and live music venue. Upon entering through the side door, however, it’s clear that this is indeed the hip new hangout just south of New Center.\nCompletely redone from its previous life as gay bar the Detroit Eagle, the Marble Bar, at 1501 Holden at Trumbull, is trimmed with wood, gold and, of course, marble touches.\nBooths are lined along one side of the spacious room with the bar on the other. An upstairs lounge allows for a birds-eye view of most of the action. Tucked under that is the stage which will host DJs, local punk and rock bands and touring acts. This Saturday the attraction is a masquerade ball with local musicians, a fashion show, burlesque performance and an art show.\nAt the bar, which is topped with cool marble, Hamm’s and Stroh’s beer is offered for only $2.50, and the bar has a good selection of bourbons and single malt Scotch. Marble Bar also has red, white and sparking wine.\nA craft cocktail list is on par with trends, using fresh and thoughtful ingredients. Some of the drinks have Detroit-centric names like Purple Gang, M10 and the Billy Bonds, a rye-based cocktail made with vermouth and a house-made honey lemon syrup. We’re told that when there’s a packed house for a show the full cocktail list may not be available so people can be served quickly.\nThose who were barflies in Detroit in the 1950s before the Lodge was built may remember the original Marble Bar, which was moved to make way for the freeway, and then torn down to pave way for Wayne State University. The current bar’s owners have been able to find some glassware from the original bar.\nApplebee’s opens Monday \nLivonia-based restaurant group TEAM Schostak Family Restaurants will open the first Applebee’s restaurant in Detroit proper on Monday.\nLocated at 8 Mile and Woodward, the casual chain will have all the trimmings of other Applebee’s locations, including new menu items like the Kickin’ Turkey Stacker and Triple Hog Dare Ya. Detroit’s Atwater Brewery has also crafted 8 Mile Amber, a new beer to be sold only at the Detroit Applebee’s.\nDeliciously Brief \n■ Bob and Mary Higgins who owned Oxford Inn in Royal Oak are now operating a new restaurant in New Baltimore.
