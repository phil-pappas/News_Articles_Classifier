Now the mother of two is talking about her teenage children, who have also been diagnosed with the chronic illness. \n\"When my two youngest children, Bella [age 18] and Anwar [16], were diagnosed with chronic Lyme disease in early 2012, watching my babies struggle in silence in order to support me in my journey, struck the deepest core of hopelessness inside of me,\" Foster said at the Global Lyme Alliance gala, according to People magazine. \nBella Hadid is a model and the rumored girlfriend of R&B singer The Weeknd. \nFoster has been battling the disease for three years now and received an honor at the gala. \"This award is for Anwar and Bella,\" she said. \"This is my token and my promise to you that I will not allow you to live a life of pain and suffering. I will walk to the end of the earth to find a cure so that you can live a healthy life that you deserve.\" \nFoster, who's married to acclaimed musician David Foster, also touched on how the disease affected her family's quality of life. \n\"I am so sorry for all the important things I have missed in your life these past four years,\" she said. \"All three of my children really got short-changed with a dumb blonde in the white robe, that mostly lives her life in bed. ...I did turn into a professional social media stalker, though -- liking every Twitter and Instagram you have ever posted, just to let you know that I was watching you from afar.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:49:19.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
