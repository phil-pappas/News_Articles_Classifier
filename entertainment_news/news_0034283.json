Brown/AFP/Getty Images It’s official. Adele fans — who have been waiting for four years for the musical superstar to release a new CD — has confirmed her new album will be called 25. The singer issued a statement indicating the new album will be a musical homage to her transition into adulthood. Using her age to title her albums is a tradition with Adele. Her debut disc was called “19,” and was followed by “21.” In her statement, Adele wrote, “My last record was a break-up record, and if I had to label this one, I would call it a make-up record. Making up for lost time. Making up for everything I ever did and never did. “’25’ is about getting to know who I’ve become without realising. And I’m sorry it took so long but, you know, life happened.” \nThis will be the first album from Adele since the birth of her son, Angelo, in October, 2012.. \nRecording sessions for the new album have continued sporadically since then, with producers reported to include Gnarls Barkley’s Dangermouse (Brian Burton), Swedish hitmaker Max Martin, Diane Warren, and One Republic’s Ryan Tedder. \nA surprise preview of the album appeared without warning on Sunday night in Britain, during a commerical break on “The X Factor.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:00:43.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
