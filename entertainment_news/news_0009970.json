Instead, the Patriots had to settle for a 34-27 win. But you probably won’t hear many complaints from anyone with the team.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below The first half at Lucas Oil Stadium didn’t go quite as well as the Patriots might have hoped. They trailed heading into the locker room for the first time this season. It was actually the first time this season they didn’t take a double-digit lead into the break. The Patriots grabbed control in the second half with two touchdowns while holding the Colts off the scoreboard in the third quarter.\nBefore the Patriots are on to the New York Jets, here are five takeaways from this game:\n1. Rob Gronkowski opens up everything else: For the second straight week, tight end Rob Gronkowski was held without a catch in the first half. For the second straight week, slot receivers stepped up.\nGronkowski finally recorded his first catch of the game in the third quarter. His second catch was for a touchdown. While his presence on the stat sheet was relatively minimal, his impact on the field was much bigger. Thanks to Gronkowski, wide receivers Julian Edelman and Danny Amendola each finished with at least six catches.\nThe Patriots’ offense isn’t the most explosive unit in the NFL, but it can be methodical while marching down the field one step at a time on its way to the end zone.\n2. The Patriots pass defense has its weaknesses: For a majority of the first half, the Colts’ offensive line did a marvelous job of blocking the Patriots’ defensive line. Quarterback Andrew Luck was not sacked once in the first half, and the Colts offense moved down the field with ease as a result.\nThe Patriots’ defense hasn’t faced many stiff challenges this season. In their last three games, they’ve faced Tyrod Taylor (Buffalo Bills), Blake Bortles (Jacksonville Jaguars) and Brandon Weeden (Dallas Cowboys). Needless to say, Luck is a step above those quarterbacks. The Colts picked the Patriots apart with short passes and crossing patterns underneath the soft belly of the zone defenses, forcing the cornerbacks and linebackers to move horizontally across the field. Luck completed 30 of his 50 passes (60 percent) for 312 yards and three touchdowns.\nWith the lack of a Patriots’ pass rush and the Colts’ focus on a quick passing game, Luck found rhythm. The Patriots had a hard time throwing him off of it until they finally started creating pressure.\n3. The Patriots may be in the market for an offensive tackle: The Patriots’ situation at left tackle went from bad to worse on Sunday. Four days after losing Nate Solder for the season to a torn biceps, the Patriots lost backup Marcus Cannon to a foot injury in the first quarter. Sebastian Vollmer moved over to the left side and Cameron Fleming filled in on the right. The Patriots were lucky to have activated Fleming earlier this week.\nBrady was under duress on Sunday, and there are already several injuries and absences on the offensive line. If Cannon is out for any significant amount of time, the Patriots could be looking for another tackle to add to the depth chart this week.\n4. Tom Brady is not human, he is a machine: Aside from one early miscue that wasn’t even truly his fault, Tom Brady was sterling against the Colts. Brady finished 23-of-37 passing for 312 yards, three touchdowns and one interception. It wasn’t just the final stat line that was impressive, but it was the way he reached those numbers.\nThe Patriots’ offensive line has fallen apart piece by piece this season, yet Brady has been able to avoid pressure to keep plays alive. For a man to move the way he does, at his age, is impressive. Whether he’s rolling out of the pocket to open up extra lanes or moving up or laterally in the pocket, Brady is using his legs more and more each week. He may have to keep it up if the Patriots’ injuries on the offensive line don’t heal in short order.\n5. Injuries reinforcements are needed: Marcus Cannon already got a mention, but his injury was far from the only one the Patriots faced on Sunday.\nWithout linebacker Dont’a Hightower heading into the game, they also lost defensive end Jabaal Sheard and special teams ace Matthew Slater during the course of the game. Slater’s injury happened late enough that the Patriots never had to find an answer there, but Sheard left the game in the first half. The Patriots stuck with Chandler Jones and Rob Ninkovich as their top horses at defensive end, and rode them even harder with Sheard out.\nThe Patriots are beginning to face some adversity in the injury department, but some key players will begin to come back. Wide receiver Brandon LaFell is eligible to return next week, and center Bryan Stork is eligible to come back just a couple weeks later.\nPHOTOS: Colts fans mock Patriots with Deflategate signs and gear\nPrevious -- of -- Next Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard looks at a sign at the entrance to the New England Patriots tunnel before their game against the Colts.
