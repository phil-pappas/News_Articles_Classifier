Photo: Picasa \nCABARET \nEXPOSING EDITH ★★★★☆ \nMichaela Burger, Fringe Festival \nMelba Spiegeltent, until October 4 \nAdvertisement Michaela Burger is a blazing life force in her evocation of Edith Piaf, whose art and inspiration she has absorbed to the extent that she inhabits the great French chanteuse for an hour of witty narrative and extraordinary song.\nShe is abetted admirably by Greg Wain, guitarist and occasional vocalist (their duet on Autumn Leaves is a time-stopper, a crystalline portrait of love's melancholy).\nGiven that Piaf (born 100 years ago) sprang from the harsh streets of Paris, it seems appropriate that the venerable Spiegeltent has found its place in still gritty Collingwood. Burger is moved to relay that it is not impossible that Piaf might once have trod these very boards.\nPiaf's key songs — La vie en rose ; Hymne a l'amour ; Milord ; Non, Je ne regrette rien – are given context in the arc of a life lived to the overflowing. Musical collaborators, pleasingly, are acknowledged.\nOnly a heart of no spirit could fail to be moved by this extraordinary presentation. Burger and Wain deserved their standing ovation, and more.\nMelbourne has hosted some outstanding portraits of great singers — Vika Bull as Etta James, Nichaud Fitzgibbon in the mantle of Peggy Lee. Exposing Edith is there with the best.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:15:45.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
