That's how they had fun together -- by going to Corvette shows,\" their son said.\nSchmid's dad had already owned a 1958 and a '61 Corvette by the time 1986 rolled around. It was then he started a hunt for another \"old Vette.\" A friend tipped him off about a neglected 1960 convertible sitting on the side of a garage in Hoffman Estates.\n\"An old lady owned it and wanted it gone,\" said Schmid. The woman's husband had bought it as a project. The engine was apart and in boxes. It took the help of several friends but Schmid Sr. was able to remove the dilapidated and unloved heap.\nAs soon as Schmid Sr. got it home, work commenced. The chassis was cracked and need to be rewelded. Those car-loving pals returned often to lend a hand, including lifting off the body to slide the frame out. The engine was rebuilt and bored out to 327 cubic inches. Throughout the restoration, young Schmid did his part to transform the vehicle.\n\"Through middle school and high school, I remember many late nights out in the garage with dad,\" said Schmid, who lives in Rolling Meadows. The Chevy was completed in the late 1990s.\nIt was originally green but Schmid Sr. wanted it painted Honduras Maroon.\n\"He took his time and did it right,\" Schmid said. \"Many times he had to overcome problems. He stuck with it and made sure everything went back together perfectly.\"\nSchmid Sr. passed away in June of 2012 but the car continues to make family memories. The Corvette was featured in Schmid's wedding photos, as well as those of his three siblings. Schmid continues to preserve the classic, taking frequent trips with his family.\n\"The Corvette is dad -- both memories of him and a reminder of his hard work,\" Schmid said. \"He was my best friend. I got two things from him: his work ethic and the car.\"\nâ€¢ Email comments, suggestions to auto@dailyherald.com.\n Autos Hoffman Estates Rolling Meadows Avery, Matt Lifestyle", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-26T13:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:10:50.641+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
