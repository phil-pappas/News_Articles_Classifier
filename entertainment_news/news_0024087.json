Collins also returned two punts for 49 yards. Ten different Cadets had rushing attempts as coach Danny Britt pulled most of his starters by the middle of the second quarter.\nCollins added a second touchdown when he scored on a 1-yard run, and sophomore Dennis Bailey added a 4-yard touchdown run with 2:15 left in the half.\nWhile the Benedictine offense was moving the football at will, the defense also did its part to make life miserable for the Rebels as it came up with three interceptions and limited Groves to only 7 yards total offense, three on the ground, on 24 plays in the first half. Groves had 11 plays that resulted in negative yardage, and finished with 28 yards rushing, 26 by quarterback Tyrone Gadson.\n“Our starters came out and did what they had to do,” Britt said. “I was worried about our focus, but once the game started we were fine.\n“We were able to start working on our rotations in the second quarter, and we got to play a lot of people. There are still some things we need to work on, but we did a fine job.”\nBenedictine got 4-yard scoring run in the third quarter from Shawn Campbell and added scores in the fourth on a 15-yard run with a fumble recovery by Mallie Seckinger and RaQuez Martin on a 20 yard run.\nGroves 0 0 0 0 – 0\nBenedictine 34 14 7 13 – 68\nBC—Jacob Collins 9 run (kick failed)\nBC— Nick Whitfield 10 pass from Nick Iannone (Jake Karesh kick)\nBC— Kalen Deloach 5 pass from Iannone (Karesh kick)\nBC— Michael Dernell 14 pass from Iannone (Karesh kick)\nBC— Wesley Kennedy 29 run (Karesh kick)\nBC— Collins 1 run (Karesh kick)\nBC— Dennis Bailey 4 run (Karesh kick)\nBC— Shawn Campbell 4 run (Powell Fisher kick)\nBC— Mallie Seckinger 15 fumble return (Fisher kick)\nBC— RaQuez Martin 20 run (kick failed)", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-23T18:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:20:20.632+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
