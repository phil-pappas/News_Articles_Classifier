(Photo: COURTESY OF WARNER BROS AND RHINO)\n3704 CONNECT 41 TWEET LINKEDIN 4 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Thirty years ago, a 16-year-old Ohio boy saw a video on MTV that changed his life.\nThe song was Take On Me by the Norwegian trio a-ha.\nEven if you’re a millennial, you’ve heard the synth-pop song with the catchy chorus and singer Morten Harket’s incredible falsetto. (Or at least you’ve heard the song sampled in Feel This Moment , the 2013 hit by Pitbull featuring Christina Aguilera.) And you’ve probably seen the groundbreaking pencil sketch/live-animation video. It won six MTV Video Music Awards in 1986 – and even today it’s fun to watch.\nDirected by Steve Barron, the video begins with a young woman reading a comic book in a coffee shop. Suddenly the arm of the hero (played by Harket) comes out of the comic, inviting the girl to join him. He shows her around this black-and-white world, which features a portal where people seem real on one side and sketched on the other. When the bad guys break the portal, Harket and the girl run away to escape. Of course, there’s a happy ending.\nThirty years ago, on Oct. 19, 1985, Take On Me reached the top of the Billboard charts.\nWhile the band — also known as Magne (Mags) Furuholmen and Paul Waaktaar-Savoy — would go on to release more than 40 singles and remain popular around the world, it was a-ha’s only No. 1 song in America.\nSuper Deluxe Edition\nIf you grew up in the 1980s, you may remember that Take On Me was the first single from a-ha’s debut album, Hunting High and Low . What really made me fall in love with the band was their second single, The Sun Always Shines on TV , which made it to No. 20 (and No. 1 in the U.K.).\nThe title track is also beautiful, but never charted in the U.S. Just about every song on the record is good, although I never liked Train of Thought, the album’s third single, which was a flop.\nIn 2010, while the band was embarking on what was then a “final” world tour, a-ha released a remastered Deluxe Edition of Hunting High and Low , featuring demos, extended versions and B sides. But to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the album this year, a-ha recently released the Super Deluxe Edition.\nFor fans like me —and yes, there a few Americans like me out there — it’s simply incredible.\nA promo shot for the band featured in the Super Deluxe Edition of “Hunting High and Low.” This was also the cover of the program for the group’s first world tour, which began in 1986. (Photo: COURTESY OF YUTAKA NISHIMURA)\nThe set by Warner Bros. and Rhino includes everything on the previous edition, as well as never-before released versions of the album’s songs. There is also a DVD featuring the album’s videos, including one from 1984 that the band made for the song’s original release.\nThe best part is that the set is a 60-page hardback book, featuring the story of how the band was discovered and how it recorded its debut album. There are also tons of pictures, including outtakes from Hunting High and Low ’s cover.\nWhile I realize most people won’t spend $40 on this set, a-ha deserves to be remembered. Sure some of their lyrics are silly or puzzling or make you question if they have a command of the English language, but there are gems on every album.\nThe collection\nThe group’s second record, Scoundrel Days , was less poppy, even a bit dark. There is also more guitar, a sign of things to come. It is not their best effort, but there are some great songs. I listened to it constantly during my senior year of high school.\nBecause of a lack of radio play and poor sales, a-ha stopped touring America. They focused on Europe and South America, where they were, and still are, far more popular.\nMagne Furuholmen (left to right), Morten Harket and Paul Waaktaar-Savoy of a-ha on stage in Oslo during their “farewell” show in 2010. (Photo: AFP/Getty Images)\nBy Stay On These Roads , their third album, U.S. record stores stopped carrying their singles and radio stations stopped playing their songs. I had to start buying British imports to keep my collection going.\nOne of most prized possessions is a picture disc of The Living Daylights , their James Bond theme from the 1987 movie featuring Timothy Dalton. I also had a poster of them that I put on my dorm wall as a freshman at Ohio State University. My roommate was not happy (he liked Whitesnake).\n20 years later...\nI finally saw a-ha in 2005, when they played Irving Plaza in Manhattan to support their eighth album, Analogue . Harket may be the singer but he let Mags serve as the frontman, talking to the crowd, which was thrilled to be there.\nI had a great time. To be surrounded by 1,500 people who loved the band as much as I did was incredible.\nI saw them again in 2010, when they returned to the Big Apple to play three sold-out shows at what was then the Nokia Theatre. At the second one, I bought two T-shirts, including one featuring a Take On Me - inspired pencil-drawn sketch of Harket.\nWhat are they doing now? In addition to the Super Deluxe Edition of their first album, a-ha recently finished the South American leg of their world tour to support their 10th and latest album, Cast In Steel . They start playing Europe in March.\nAs of now, there are no plans to play the United States.\nBut either way, I’ll keep listening. As their song says, love is reason enough.\n3704 CONNECT 41 TWEET LINKEDIN 4 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1LEnrYp TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c711c85d58e411988f13438d0dec93db9715f141/r=400x400/local/-/media/2015/10/15/AsburyPark/B9319292859Z.1_20151015180700_000_G2FC8E5VU.1-0.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1LEnrYp", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/526d2838b5080be3e04b8f9fef642f002338908f/c=371-0-3449-2314&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/15/AsburyPark/B9319292859Z.1_20151015180700_000_G2FC8E617.1-0.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/012bb576a43803dfb371cb8b1e45d5a44a092dd8/c=163-0-1599-1080&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/15/AsburyPark/B9319292859Z.1_20151015180700_000_GEEC8LBLM.1-0.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/15/AsburyPark/B9319292859Z.1_20151015180700_000_G2FC8E5VU.1-0.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LEnrYp&text=%27Take%20On%20Me%27%3A%20a-ha%27s%20one%20American%20hit%20still%20a%20wonder&via=usatoday", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LEnrYp&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/637a6b4b67ed117b9c6c3fc8ac5f49656d001866/c=0-271-3002-2528&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/15/AsburyPark/B9319292859Z.1_20151015180700_000_G2FC8E5VU.1-0.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T02:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T03:53:47.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
