Fox, who played McFly, and director Robert Zemeckis returned. \nFox, now 54, was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1991. He semi-retired from acting in 2000 as his symptoms worsened and focused his energy on research for a cure. But he has since done a few television shows. \n\"You have to be careful when you're doing a sequel or a 'prequel', because it's really about the story. You can't just do the same story over and over again,\" producer Frank Marshall told Reuters. \n\"I think it's OK to have sequels, but they have to be their own movie as well ... I'm happy to see things like \"Jurassic\", like \"Bourne\". I don't think we're going to see another \"Back to the Future\" ... I think that one's done.\" \nThis Wednesday, Oct. 21, is being dubbed \"Back to the Future Day\". McFly and Doc travel there in the second film to find a world of flying cars and hovering skateboards or 'hoverboards', along with phenomena that turned out to be closer to the mark such as wearable eyeglass-screens and video calling. \nMarshall, whose credits also include \"Indiana Jones\" films and the \"Bourne\" series, was speaking at an event marking the DVD release in London of the summer blockbuster \"Jurassic World\", to which a sequel has been confirmed for 2018. \n(Reporting By Sara Hemrajani; Writing by Marie-Louise Gumuchian; Editing by Kevin Liffey) Actors Michael J Fox (r) and Christopher Lloyd attend a media conference for the 30th anniversary of their film ''Back to the Future'' at the London Film and Comic-Con in London, Britain July 17, 2015.
