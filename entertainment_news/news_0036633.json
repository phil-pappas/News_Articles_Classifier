Simon Cowell (Thames/Syco) \nSpeaking to USA Today, Simon said: “About five or six years ago, I was offered the chance to be on the show and, at the time, I couldn’t do it. But I was a bit disappointed that I wasn’t able to.” \nThe star added: “I think at the point we really knew Howard wasn’t going to come back, we then had serious conversations with NBC. I thought, ‘I think this is the right time.’ I’m excited about it.” \nThe US network said Simon will start next season, but it will not affect his commitment to ITV shows Britain’s Got Talent and The X Factor. \nThe Got Talent boss took to Twitter to announce the news: \nhttps://twitter.com/SimonCowell/status/657169153300656128 \nIt was his acidic commentary on American Idol that launched him into super stardom across the Atlantic. \nWhen Simon left American Idol after the 2010 season, it was still one of US television’s top shows. Promoted stories \nThe 56-year-old will begin his stint on America’s Got Talent shortly after American Idol, which has been cancelled after 13 years, and goes off the air for the final time in 2016. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNH_ge_J3kA \nAmerica’s Got Talent still commands solid viewing figures, even as ratings for other reality shows have fallen. \n“What I love about this show is that it’s open to absolutely anyone,” Cowell said. “America has some fantastic talent just waiting to be discovered, and I would like that talent to come to our show, including any dogs who can sing.” \nThe X Factor boss has not served as a judge on American TV since his US version of ITV’s X Factor ended in 2013.
