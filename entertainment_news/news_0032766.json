The Block contestants Kingi and Caro pictured in their winning guest bedroom. Channel 9 Cars For Sale \nKINGI and Caro have a lot to celebrate this week. \nThe Townsville parents won their first room on The Block tonight and received some of the highest praise ever dished out on the renovation show from judge Shaynna Blaze. \nTo top it off, they're just returned home from Sydney where they watched the Cowboys' one-point win over the Broncos in the NRL grand final. \n\"It's been a good few days for North Queensland,\" Caro told APN. \nIn The Block's own all-Queensland competition, Caro and Kingi beat Gold Coast mums Suzi and Vonni by just half a point. \nThe judges were full of praise for the couple's second guest bedroom, which continued the urban industrial theme of their South Yarra apartment. \n\"As soon as you walk in everything captures you; this is just beautiful,\" Blaze said.

Channel 9 \n\"I don't say this often but to me this couple has so much talent I hope they do this as a career.\" \nCaro, who admits she had never picked up an interior design book before going on the show, said she was blown away by the praise. \n\"She's a hard marker. If you can impress her you're doing pretty good,\" she said. \nThe previous week's winners Suzi and Vonni appear to have solidified their luxury style, impressing the judges with another glass feature wall. \n\"I have to say I quite like this. The previous one completely overwhelmed me. I felt like I was backed into a corner by it,\" Neale Whitaker said. \n\"Occasionally it is really nice to be proven wrong. I just love the way they have created a matching pair of rooms using these images to show diff aspects of Melbourne. I get it; I'm sold.\" Suzi and Vonni's second guest bedroom in a scene from The Block. Channel 9 \nPenthouse renovators Dean and Shay finished third. \nWhile their concrete and brass feature wall earned praise as a return to form after last week's safely styled master bedroom, the Newcastle couple did lose out on points for a few practical mistakes. \nTheir en-suite, though, was nearly faultless. \n\"It's like they've thought outside the squareâ€¦ it feels expensive; it says 'this is the penthouse apartment',\" Whitaker said.

The Melbourne couple not only delivered a finished guest bedroom and en-suite, they also finished the master thanks to some time management advice from site foreman Keith Schleiger. \nTheir orange feature wall and pastel bedding divided the judges, who were more impressed with the original ideas of last week's unfinished room. \n\"They are not targeting their buyer; they don't know who they're selling to,\" Blaze said.

Channel 9 \nWestern Australian siblings Luke and Ebony finished last again, the third time in four weeks, as they struggle to move away from their art deco theme. \nDespite taking on advice from Whitaker, Ebony was forced into using her deco-inspired bedhead from the previous week's challenge \n\"The head board is just way too dominant,\" Whitaker said. \n\"That will be all that you remember, not just from this room but the whole apartment. \n\"Let's hope this is the last time we see this (art deco) influence in this apartment.\" Luke and Ebony's second guest bedroom in a scene from The Block. Channel 9 \nDarren Palmer said the bedroom felt old-fashioned with Blaze going a step further, calling the room morbid and dark. \nDated choices continued into the en-suite where the judges panned their choice of white tiles and dark grout. \nThis week the five teams will renovate their studies, guest powder room and laundry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:37:17.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
