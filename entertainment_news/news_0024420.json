When there's a big truck coming (sic),\" Kanye explained. \nDuring the interview, Kanye also talked about his reality TV star wife Kim Kardashian, insisting he is outraged that she has failed to garner much critical acclaim for her popular series \"Keeping Up With The Kardashians.\" \n\"My wife and her family shoulda had plenty of Emmys by now,\" he declared, \"I feel proud to be in a family that has so many people breaking ground for the generations to come.
