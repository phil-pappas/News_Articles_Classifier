Tom Barnes Local Real Estate Cars For Sale \nBYRON BAY metalcore band Parkway Drive has reached the top position in the Aria Albums Chart today with their fifth album, Ire. \nThe announcement coincided with the band playing at the Byron Bay High school this weekend as part of their national Ire tour. \nByron Shire Council could start selling 'Parkway Drive' street signs online, as the sign for the local street the band is named after (and where they started playing their music) is anecdotally the one that goes missing often in Byron Bay. \n\nIre, released last week, becomes the band's fourth Top 10 album and first to make it to No.1 on the ARIA Albums Chart. \nSpeaking ahead of their Byron Bay gig, front man Winston McCall acknowledged that Ire was a big bet for the band, as it has a different sound to their previous releases. \nMcCall, 33, was not expecting the band's success to reach such highs when the band started, and that he had the letters BBHC tattooed on him at age 19, meaning Byron Bay Hard Core. Album cover for Ire (2015) \n\"If you had said to the 19-year old version of me that this music would one day be accepted the way it is now, I would have just laughed and laughed. \n\"There is a reason why I have a BBHC tattoo. It's because when we started playing this kind of music there was no metal scene. You could count the amount of people involved in Byron with one hand. \n\"This kind of music was misunderstood and ignored. Bands would play halls or houses and we would only get one shot at a venue because nobody would ever want that kind of music back in their venue, until the Byron Bay Youth Centre was created to give it a home. \n\"It's so good to see the Youth Centre to grow into what it is now, because it has been such a fantastic for myself and so many of my friends,\" McCall said. \nAccording to noise11.com , Ire becomes the 744th No.1 Album in Australia (1965 to 2015) and the 595th for ARIA (1983 to 2015). \nParkway Drive first charted in September of 2005 with their debut set Killing with a Smile, followed a couple of years later with their second set Horizons, which peaked at #6 in October 2007, followed by Deep Blue (peaked at #2 in July 2010) and then their last set was Atlas, which peaked at #3 in November 2012. \nThe band has become the 99th Aussie act to make it to the top here, whilst they are the fourth Aussie group for 2015 after Hillsong United, Tame Impala and Northlane. \nParkway Drive is playing again tomorrow Sunday at 6pm at the Byron Bay High School.
