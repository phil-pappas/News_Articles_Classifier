When the establishment of the chair was announced, Wylie, who is also president of the State Library, told Bookmarks: \"It's [got to be] somebody who can speak to the community, inspire people's interest in Australian literature, who will raise the profile of Australian literature, respected in Australia and internationally for accomplishments in Australian literature and so it will be somebody who will have quite a significant public role in addition to the usual role at the university. The other important thing is this is a partnership between the University and the State Library.\"\nBoisbouvier-Wylie, who is French honorary consul general in Melbourne, came to Australia about 18 years ago and has discovered \"all sorts of Australian literature that I had been completely oblivious to and that I have grown to appreciate a lot\". When asked  about favourite writers and books, she did mention Flanagan's Booker-winner, The Narrow Road to the Deep North : \"The one that has made a long-lasting impression on me was Narrow Road. That has really explained a lot, about my father-in-law and all sorts of things that book has talked about.\"\nAdvertisement The donation by the Wylies is undoubtedly a great thing for this City of Literature.\nLindsay Tanner's new comfort zone \nJohn Wylie is a former head of investment bank Lazard, where one of his colleagues was the former Finance Minister in the Rudd government, Lindsay Tanner. Since leaving parliament, Tanner has written a couple of books, Sideshow: Dumbing Down Democracy and Politics with Purpose . But in February, his first novel will be published. According to his publisher, Scribe, Comfort Zone is an \"astute novel about inner-city Australian racism â€” and about humanity emerging in the face of reality ... in which a taxi driver, Jack van Duyn,  experiences a bewildering, hair-raising descent into a world of drug-dealing, ASIO harassment, criminal thuggery, and Somali payback\". \nThe best bookshop in the world? \nMelbourne bookshops should prick up their metaphorical ears at the news that as part of its international excellence awards, the London Book Fair is looking for the international bookstore of the year. The award is open to independent or chain book shops outside Britain. There is no stipulation regarding turnover and the judges will be looking at areas such as \"customer service, staff knowledge, events, display, outreach, atmosphere, innovation, imagination, incorporation of digital, style and flare\".
