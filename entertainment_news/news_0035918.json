He went on to deliver strong performances in films like \"Jab We Met\", \"Kaminey\", \" Haider\" among others.\n  A photo posted by Shahid Kapoor (@shahidkapoor) onSep 23, 2015 at 7:40am PDT\n \n\"He (Shahid) has done it... Achieved all on his own. I had told him if you need any support we are there with you as parents,\" said Pankaj, whose daughter Sanah is now making her acting debut with Shahid and Alia Bhatt-starrer \"Shaandaar\".\n\"I think the selection of a film should be taken by them (kids), they should handle their career in their own way. I think younger generation is much smarter than us. I am happy and proud of my kids,\" the 61-year-old actor said.\nAt a time when film industry children are promoted either by their parents or their godfathers, Kapur does not believe in doing so for his next generation.\n\"I believe your children should work on their own and make a name for themselves. By doing this they become confident. My parents did this with me and I tried to do the same with my children. I think the biggest example of this is my son Shahid who did everything on his own without my help,\" Pankaj said.\nThe three-time National Film Award winning actor will be seen sharing screen space for the first time with his son Shahid and daughter Sanah in the Vikas Bahl-directed film.\n\"This film marks the debut of my daughter. I am in supportive cast. My son is hero and daughter is there in the film, so thought we will get some time to be together. We had a great time working together,\" he said.\n\"I had seen 'Queen', which was directed by Vikas Bahl and I felt it is good to work with talented directors and the role was good, hence accepted to do the film,\" he added.\nKapur also hopes to work in a film together with his entire family including actress wife Supriya Pathak.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T15:29:17.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
