The previous records were set in 2008. Since then, TV ratings in general have shrunk, which makes the current spike even more remarkable.\nThe first GOP debate ranks as the highest-rated live event in cable TV history, not counting sports.\nMany factors help account for the growth, but Trump must get most of the credit. He was a big media star before he decided to run for president and his ability to speak to the TV audience – honed in a decade of hosting “The Apprentice” – has made him a huge drawing card.\nPoliticians always have sparred with each other, but Trump has thrown out the rulebook for such battles, and people tune in for his outragousness.\nThe Democratic debate must have benefited from the spillover. But the most quoted comment came when Bernie Sanders defended Hillary Clinton. With no Trumpian body blows thrown, one wonders if the Democrats will do as well next time, which comes Nov. 14 in Des Moines, Iowa.\nThe next GOP debate – Oct. 28 on CNBC – almost didn’t have Trump, who refused to take part unless the show was limited to two hours and candidates were allowed opening and closing statements. After fellow candidate Ben Carson concurred with Trump, CNBC had little choice but to concede.\nThe debates don’t have commercial interruptions, but the ad space before and after can command huge premiums compared with their normal rates. Ad Age reported that CNN’s commercials around the Democratic debate cost 40 times as much as the network’s base price.\nGONE, GONE, GONE \n“Rookie Blue” and “Extant,” two dramas on network summer schedules, have been canceled.\n“Rookie Blue,” which ABC imported from Canada, ran for six summers, but ratings fell pretty hard this year. The police drama ended production at a good place to stop in the story, as the series finale saw lead character Andy (Missy Peregrym) get married.\nCBS dropped “Extant” after two disappointing seasons. The science-fiction serial brought Halle Berry back to television and was promoted heavily before its 2014 premiere. Ratings were good at first but dwindled rapidly.\nCBS retooled the story significantly for Season 2, putting Berry’s character on the run and pairing her with a new co-star, Jeffrey Dean Morgan. The show got better, but the ratings did not.\nSyfy also has been putting its scheduling ax to use, dropping dramas “Defiance” and “Dominion.”\nContact the writer: 714-796-7724 or mhewitt@ocregister.com or @WatcherofTV on Twitter or The Watcher on Facebook.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:41:34.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
