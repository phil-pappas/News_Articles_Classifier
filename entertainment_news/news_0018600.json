Apparently Jurassic World had a throwback to that sequence, a throwback which is, also, one big pile of shit. Give it a watch, if you want. Or don't.\nWho Actually Likes Laffy Taffy?\nAs Halloween approaches, our minds turn to skimpy costumes and cavity-inducing candy. Here at Maxim we wouldn't know anything about turning tricks, but which treat reigns supreme? The folks at Influenster have polled 40,000 of their users to find the most popular candy in each state. Some, like Connecticut, were correct, naming Reese's as the best. Others, like Wisconsin, need to see a goddamn doctor because choosing Laffy Taffy is just embarrassing.\nKim K. Turns 35\nEven if you really don’t care, it’s our duty to report that Kim Kardashian turns 35 today. The reality TV queen, bride of Kanye and Instagram overlord with 49.5 million followers has managed to become incredibly rich and wildly famous for not doing much of anything, and for that, we salute her. Happy Birthday, Kim, and don’t forget to post a selfie with your cake.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/mFNdIN3ag0Y"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:13:00.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
