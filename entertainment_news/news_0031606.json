Sources tell the station Brenda Delgado is in Mexico and that authorities know her location.\nKristopher Love CBS This Morning Earlier this month, Dallas police charged Kristopher Love, 31, with capital murder in the Sept. 2 shooting death of Kendra Hatcher, a 35-year-old pediatric dentist, in her apartment complex's parking garage. Police described the killing as a murder-for-hire, and issued an arrest warrant for the 33-year-old Delgado, who officials say orchestrated the killing. Officials have said Hatcher was dating Delgado's ex-boyfriend.\nAccording to the new indictment obtained by KRLD, Delgado allegedly promised Love drugs and money - both from herself and a drug cartel - to kill Hatcher.\nLove remains jailed, along with Crystal Cortes, accused of driving Love to the garage where Hatcher was murdered. Cortes was arrested Sept. 5 and charged with capital murder. According to a Dallas Police arrest affidavit, Cortes admitted being hired by Delgado to rob Hatcher. Love allegedly admitted to his role in the robbery which resulted in Hatcher's death, according to Dallas Police.\nBrenda Delgado CBS DFW Sources tell the station a relative put Delgado on a bus to Mexico shortly after it became clear she was a person of interest. The sources say federal authorities have been working with the Mexican government on extradition.\nLove is also facing a federal charge of unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon after officials say they found a gun believed to the murder weapon in his car.\nThe federal affidavit outlining the gun charge against Love refers to a fourth unnamed person in the alleged plot. It says the alleged driver, whom federal authorities don't identify, told police that she overheard the woman who allegedly planned the attack asking a fourth unidentified person \"if he knew someone that could take care of something for her.\" The alleged driver said she believed the fourth person was responsible for finding the shooter and connecting him with the alleged mastermind of the plot, who is also not named in the federal affidavit.", "external_links": ["http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/10/06/2f94ed36-05b5-43be-b611-efb0c06924a1/thumbnail/220x140/dc3b00b0106a345dbd16ae866f7f3054/1adelgadooldmug2.jpg", "http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2015/10/22/sources-authorities-know-where-uptown-dentist-murder-suspect-is-in-mexico/", "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/10/06/06bab3e8-96be-4261-a56c-4fc04cad3070/thumbnail/220x140/a00e8745210d1653eebc64f57d3d9f0e/1ashooter.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:22:49.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
