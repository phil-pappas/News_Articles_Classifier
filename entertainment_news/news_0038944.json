(Photo by Owen Sweeney/Invision/AP) Sponsored Links PHILADELPHIA — \n\"Baby you can drive my truck.\" Yeah, you heard right. \nPaul McCartney gave a private performance in Philadelphia last weekend during the American Trucking Association's Management Conference and Exhibition. \nMcCartney changed the lyrics to the Beatles song \"Drive My Car\" to play to the crowd of about 1,000, according to the industry newspaper, Transport Topics. The paper says McCartney played the two-hour show at a customer appreciation dinner given by Freightliner Trucks on Sunday. \nMcCartney's wife, Nancy Shevell, is an executive at Elizabeth, New Jersey-based New England Motor Freight, a trucking firm owned by her father. \nMcCartney made other trucking references throughout the show, but his song list was based mostly on his more than 50-year career with the Beatles and solo career.
