I have put so much effort into production and choreography, we have a great team working with us. Please come and enjoy a wonderful evening with me. See you soon.” \nInspired in part by the 100th anniversary of Frank Sinatra’s birth, Come Fly With Me is full of Peter’s takes on Rat Pack standards including the album title track Come Fly With Me, Mac The Knife and Ain’t That A Kick In The Head. \nIt’s been 20 years since Peter was first catapulted into the public consciousness with his global hit Mysterious Girl. It’s been a remarkable journey: three chart-topping number 1 singles; a further seven Top 10 hits; and Platinum, Gold and Silver certifications for seven of his albums to date.
