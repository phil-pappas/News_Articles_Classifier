During the month of October, Three Brothers Bakery will be offering new pink pumpkin cookies in celebration of Susan G. Komen Houston’s annual Race for the Cure, which falls on Halloween. Additionally, the bakery will be introducing new Breast Cancer Awareness ribbons for purchase in-store, the proceeds of which will go directly to supporting Komen Houston.\nThe bakery’s new Breast Cancer Awareness ribbons will be available for purchase at either $1 or $5 values at all three bakery locations, and these donations will be given directly to Susan G. Komen Houston in support of its mission to save lives and end breast cancer. Upon purchase of a ribbon, guests can sign their name, or the name of a loved one affected by breast cancer, and can hang the ribbon somewhere in the store. For every $5 ribbon purchased, guests will also receive a complimentary pink gingerbread man.\nAs a nine-year breast cancer survivor, and ninth in her family to be diagnosed, Three Brothers Bakery co-owner, Janice Jucker, is passionate about the cause and is active in educating and spreading awareness for the importance of early detection, helping other newly diagnosed patients through their journeys, and also serves as a board member of Susan G. Komen Houston.\n“We commit to fundraising during Breast Cancer Awareness Month every year,” says Bobby Jucker, bakery co-owner and fifth generation baker. “I’ve seen the work Susan G. Komen does first-hand through my wife, and while so much has been done in the fight against breast cancer, there is still so much left to do through research, treatment and education. Every single dollar makes an impact and we want to do our part to help.”\nFor more information regarding Three Brothers Bakery, its breast cancer awareness items, Janice’s story of diagnosis and survival or any of its other sweet products, please contact Allison Huseman at 713-225-0880 or allison@integrateagency.com .\nAbout Three Brothers Bakery\nThe traditions of Three Brothers Bakery began in Chrzanow, Poland circa 1825, and were preserved despite the family’s concentration camp imprisonment during the Holocaust.
