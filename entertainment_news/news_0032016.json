The SeriTek/i6G provides mounting points for two 2.5\" HDD, SSD, or SSHD SATA drives - all in a half-length PCIe card. It is Windows compatible and Mac OS X bootable, whether installed inside a PC or legacy Mac Pro with a PCIe 2.0 4-lane or higher slot, or mounted in a Thunderbolt PCIe expansion chassis. Performance\n\"The affordability of 6G SSD storage devices increases the need for ultra-high performance 6G SATA controllers with sufficient bandwidth to maximize throughput. With real world storage performance results in excess of 500MB/s per channel, the SeriTek/i6G provides a great way to add high-speed storage internally,\" said Chi Kim Stanford Vice President of Business Development. The SeriTek/i6G is ideal for audio/video editing, photography, large media content libraries, storage expansion, backup and any application where internal or external high performance data storage is desirable.\nWindows, Mac Pro or Thunderbolt\nFor connecting high-speed external SATA enclosures, the SeriTek/i6G works equally well as a powerful storage adapter within a Thunderbolt PCIe expansion chassis such as the ThunderTek/PX. Due to performance rivaling that of traditional tower computers, many professionals are now turning to notebooks as their primary platform for working with audio, video and photography. The Thunderbolt expansion chassis helps unlock the full performance and storage potential of Thunderbolt-equipped Windows notebooks as well as Apple's latest systems such as the 2013 Mac Pro, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, Mac mini, and the iMac.\nKey Features and Benefits\nMount up to two 2.5\" SSD or HDD directly on the card Mac OS X 10.6.X through 10.10.x bootable with PCIe 2.0 slot Supports Windows 7/8/10 (non-bootable) Compatible with Thunderbolt PCIe Expansion Chassis like ThunderTek/PX (Windows 8 & Mac OS X) Converts Thunderbolt expansion chassis into an internal dual bay enclosure PCI-Express Base 2.0 specification compliant, supports 2.5 Gbps and 5.0 Gbps Backwards-compatible with SATA 6.0 Gb/s, 3.0 Gb/s and 1.5 Gb/s hard drives Fully compliant with Serial ATA Revision 3.0 specification Supports Disk Utility RAID and JBOD configuration Complete CRC error checking for ensuring data integrity Bandwidth can exceed 760MB/sec. with high-speed SSD configuration User-upgradeable firmware\nPricing and Availability\nThe SeriTek/i6G eSATA controller for Apple Mac Pro and Windows 7/8/10 PC is available now, with a retail price of $99.95 USD. The SeriTek/i6G (SATA-i6G) can be purchased from FirmTek distributors, resellers or directly from FirmTek. The FirmTek Store is offering two introductory specials for a limited time.\nSpecial Bundle #1: includes one ThunderTek/PX Thunderbolt expansion chassis and one SeriTek/i6G for the amazing low price of $199.95.\nSpecial Bundle #2: FirmTek store customers only can purchase two SeriTek/i6G cards for $149.95 That's 50% off the second card purchased at the same time!\nAbout FirmTek, LLC\nHeadquartered in Silicon Valley and founded by former Apple engineers, FirmTek is a leading hardware and firmware research and development company focusing on storage technologies.
