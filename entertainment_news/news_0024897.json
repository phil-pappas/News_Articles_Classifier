Daniel Oglesby, during a homecoming ceremony in Colorado. \n\"Little Karis Oglesby, she just couldn't wait. She broke reins from her family. She ran out to greet her daddy before he was dismissed,\" a KKTV anchor said. \nIt's the hug that harbored hundreds of \"awws,\" getting highlighted nationally on E! , NBC and ABC . \nIn February, Oglesby was deployed to Kuwait. It was likely a long eight months for the family, but for a toddler, five minutes can seem like an eternity. \nPlus, Thursday was Karis' birthday. What a perfect present. Daniel's wife, Kristine, also told us the last time he came back from deployment was the first time he met Karis. \nShe was 2 months old then and cried. But no tears this time. Kristine said it \"was a totally different homecoming.\" \nNBC says Kristine would read to Karis and their other daughter, Layla, while he was gone. \nOne book was about military deployment called \" Lily Hates Goodbyes .\" \nIn the book, the little girl runs out to give her father a hug when he gets home. Clearly, Karis was inspired. \nOglesby will also be home through the holidays. \nThis video includes images from Halchak Photography .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T18:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:25:31.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
