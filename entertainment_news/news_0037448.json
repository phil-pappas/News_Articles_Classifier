In this edition, ADELE IS BACK.\n1. Adele, \"Hello\"\nMore from Songs of the Week 20 articles The 5 Songs You Need to Hear This Week The 7 Songs You Need to Hear This Week The 5 Songs You Need to Hear This Week The 5 Songs You Need to Hear This Week YAS QUEEN! YAS QUEEN! YAS QUEEN! Great, now that that's out of the way — this is Adele's first single from her first album in almost five years . The 30-second teaser alone was enough to make me tear up at work, and now that the full thing is here I'm worried that my eyes will never be dry again. She belts the shit out of this thing. Welcome back, Adele! Never leave.\n2. Justin Bieber, \"Sorry\"\nThis just confirms that Purpose is going to be so, so good. How does it feel to know the fangirls were right all along, haters?\n3. Justin Bieber & Selena Gomez, \"Strong\"\nVery few Internet things billed as \"mind-blowing\" ever succeed at blowing my mind, but this — this beautiful, unlikely gift from the web gods — broke my brain into a million pieces (start at the 16:20 mark above). How did this happen? When did it happen? Did they leak it themselves? Are they just trolling us all? Am I still rooting for them? I don't know the answers to any of these questions, but I do know that I love this.\n4. Gwen Stefani, \"Used to Love You\"\nGwen's solo output can be spotty, but her first post-Gavin single is without reproach. She's at her best on ballads like these when she abandons the SoCal party girl act in favor of raw emotion. I know why I used to love you, Gwen, and I still do!\n5. Chairlift, \"Ch-Ching\"\nThough Chairlift are mostly known for buoyant pop songs like \"Bruises\" and \"I Belong in Your Arms,\" their latest single takes its cues from hip-hop and R&B. If you liked \"No Angel,\" which Caroline Polachek co-wrote for Beyoncé, then you'll like this — it sounds like a cousin of that song.\n6. Carrie Underwood, \"Dirty Laundry\"\nThink of this Storyteller track as the sequel to \"Before He Cheats.\" Also incorporate the saying \"all the Ajax in the world ain't gonna clean your dirty laundry\" into your everyday life.\n7. One Direction, \"Perfect\"\nThis song is perfect. This video is perfect. They are all perfect. The end.\nBonus: The \"Hotline Bling\" Video\nThis song has been out for months, but thanks to the release of the instantly iconic and meme-able video, it's been stuck in the entire world's head all week. You used to call me on my cell phone, do-do do…\nOther bonus: Nicki Minaj & Beyoncé, \"Feeling Myself\"\nTheir first live duet of \"Feeling Myself\" was the biggest standout of Jay Z's massive Tidal benefit concert. Come for the #SquadGoals , stay for the dance battle.\n​Follow Eliza on Twitter .", "external_links": ["http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/640x398/gallery-1445636323-adele.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/480x298/gallery-1445636323-adele.jpg", "https://embed.itunes.apple.com/us/embedded-player/idsa.76f47263-76c3-11e5-ad28-8822e79f57de", "https://vid.me/e/qoEv?stats=1&tools=1", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/39/320x160/landscape-1443216895-gettyimages-457919100.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/320x160/landscape-1444427066-beyonce.jpg", "https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F228879934&show_artwork=true", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/980x610/gallery-1445636323-adele.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/1600x996/gallery-1445636323-adele.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/1600x800/landscape-1445636323-adele.jpg", "https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:5qRRiqndqXaq2QBudIrkYU", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/1280x797/gallery-1445636323-adele.jpg", "http://www.twitter.com/thompsonplaid", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/768x478/gallery-1445636323-adele.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/38/320x160/landscape-1442609545-ellie.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/320x160/landscape-1443811581-selena.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-24T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:23:06.575+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
