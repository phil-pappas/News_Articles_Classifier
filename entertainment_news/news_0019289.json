He himself never makes an appearance in the video, but the whole thing — featuring only beautiful women gyrating on and around each other — is a party regardless.\nMaybe that's because it's set to a trippy, sultry Skrillex beat? Maybe it's because Justin is singing about how badly he wants your body? Not only that, he's begging for a second chance and wants to \"redeem [him]self tonight.\" The song is reminiscent of \"Boyfriend\" in that Justin sounds like the sexiest preteen on the planet. Do you remember how you felt when you first saw this? Yeah, not sorry.\nGIF Share Tweet Pin E-mail Watch the video above. If I don't hear from ü after, I won't ask where are you now, I'll assume you are off exploring your new inner Belieber, your purpose. Do you see what I did there? Not sorry, never sorry.\nFollow Tess on Twitter . ​", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/tessie_the_mess", "https://instagram.com/p/87HsjLAvi8/", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/placeholder_1445547888-bieber-boyfriend-vevo-2012-justin-bieber-30716738-385-212.gif", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/1445547888-bieber-boyfriend-vevo-2012-justin-bieber-30716738-385-212.gif"], "published": "2015-10-23T01:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:56:52.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
