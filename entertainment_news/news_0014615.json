It's just magic.\" \n\"Fiesta\" (the non-remixed version) was nominated for record of the year at this year's Latin Grammys, which take place Nov. 19. In this Sept. 17, 2015 photo, members of Bomba Estereo pose for a selfie with Will Smith. (Alan Silfen/Sony via AP) Tony Hicks writes celebrity commentary for the Bay Area News Group.
