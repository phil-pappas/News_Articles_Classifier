Teaching training and outreach in schools has long been part of the center's mission, and \"this new space allows us to do all those things in our own place,\" its director, Lauren Bairnsfather, said. \nBesides the main gallery, the center contains a library, offices and a showcase for artifacts. The most stunning artifact was a striped concentration camp coat, acquired in France by a supporter of the center. As part of the opening ceremonies, an inaugural Holocaust Educator Award was given to Barbara Burstin. \nA large gallery at the center's entrance was lined with portraits of the 12 survivors and their stories. An additional 17 will be added to the exhibit, which was conceived by Hannah Wilson, with photography by Ryan Michael White and video by Garret Jones. \nWilson said she reached out in May to the area's 55 survivors of the systematic genocide inflicted by the Nazi regime in Germany from 1941-1945 in which 6 million European Jews and 5 million non-Jews were killed. \nIn a smaller, multimedia gallery painted in shades of gray, a large-screen television ran the local survivors' video stories. Sobering tales of their experiences during World War II were contrasted with stories of making new lives, finding love, having grandchildren. \nIndeed, in the same gallery was a wall full of portraits showing smiles and frustration, some posing with photographs from the past. Here was a woman holding out a creased photo that must have been from her school days. In another, a man clenches his fists, gritting his teeth in anger. \nHarry Schneider was a toddler in Poland when World War II began. His parents, Gertrude and George, fled with him to Russia, where a second child, Henya, was born. \n\"We ended up in Siberia. It was bitter cold, there was very, very little to eat and actually, my father was taken into the Russian army, so we didn't see him throughout the rest of the war,\" said Schneider, 78, of Churchill. He is a co-chairman of the Holocaust survivors' organization and a member of the center's board. \nAfter the war, the children and their mother returned to Poland and were reunited when George Schneider began searching displaced persons camps. \nTheir joy was tempered with sorrow: The rest of the extended family — grandparents, cousins, aunts and uncles — had been rounded up by the Gestapo, and were dead. Their home had been destroyed. The Schneiders left Poland, eventually arriving in Washington, Pennsylvania, after living in Austria. \nThe center will be open to the public 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, with school groups primarily on Tuesdays and Thursdays, Bairnsfather said. \n\"When you think about students now, they don't remember (the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks), or they weren't born yet. It's hard for me to imagine, but that's the truth,\" Bairnsfather added. \"If they don't remember 2001 and we are saying you have to care about this thing that happened in 1939, it's hard. But thank goodness we have the resources to get them engaged.\" \n---", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T16:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:19:55.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
