Photo: Screenshot, The Verdict, Nine Network \nIt's week three of Channel 9's The Verdict , and while the show seems to have moved away from it's early model of everyone-shouting-at-once, it hasn't yet worked out an alternative. While the first two episodes were entertainingly infuriating, the latest foray suggested it could become something even worse: painfully dull.\nHost Karl Stefanovic seems like he's settling into the gig a little better, but resident pot-stirrer Mark Latham came across as oddly neutered. He seems lost in a world of his own for much of the programme; even when he snapped into life to make his obligatory slams at inner city elites his heart didn't seem to be in it.\nHe wasn't alone, mind. In fact, for the first half of the show it seemed as though everyone was going to be dangerously reasonable. Alongside Latham was independent MP Bob Katter, journalist Angela Mollard, psychologist Sandy Rae, Mama Mia 's Jamila Rizvi, and ex-Gold Coast Suns player Campbell Brown.\nFormer Labor leader Mark Latham attacked Mr Katter's views on firearms. Photo: Screenshot, The Verdict, Nine Network \nThe first few topics didn't really catch fire: the question of whether Malcolm Turnbull should go to an early election received shrugs – although Katter insisted that Turnbull wouldn't be \"timid\" enough to go to the polls before 2016. Latham snarled that Turnbull is \"the flim flam man,\" but even that dig seemed limp.\nAdvertisement Similarly the question of whether the paparazzi should be able to photograph the children of celebrities saw everyone in furious agreement that no, they shouldn't. So far, so dull.\nAnd then it was onto the subject of gun control, which seemed like an easy win. After all, Katter has been outspokenly in favour of allowing more weapons in, and his son-in-law is the current importer of the rapid-fire Adler shotgun. So things were going to get spicy, right?\nThe full panel of episode three of The Verdict. Photo: Screenshot, The Verdict, Nine Network \nThe mood was set with Stefanovic interviewing Walter Mikac, who lost his wife and young daughters in the Port Arthur Massacre. Mikac spoke eloquently about his concerns that Australian gun laws were being \"watered down by stealth,\" pointing out that existing laws are more than generous regarding people owning weapons if they feel the need, \"but you don't need to fire eight shots in eight seconds to protect yourself.\"\nAnd that was powerful, rational stuff - but was there really a need to up the stakes by attempting to get the guy to cry on live TV? Stefanovic pulled out as many emotional questions as possible regarding Mikac's daughters, pointing out that they'd be in their early twenties now - \"Where do you think they'd be now? What do you think they'd be doing?\" - which Mikac answered with impressive dignity instead of asking what the hell Stefanovic was playing at.\nAnd after the interview, everyone was ready to pile onto Katter about the evils of guns. Latham got a rise by demanding to know \"How could you sleep at night if these weapons got on the street… and your family are bringing them in to make a few bob?\", but the attacks on Katter's family largely (ahem) missed their target.\nMama Mia women's network editor-in-chief Jamila Rizvi in discussion with Bob Katter. Photo: Screenshot, The Verdict, Nine Network \nAnd this was annoying, because Katter's actual argument was incredibly easy to (ahem) shoot down: the Good Guy With A Gun Stops Bad Guy With A Gun argument, which literally never works in the real world. Indeed, in the wake of the Northern Arizona University shooting earlier this month armed students on campus told media they didn't intervene, not least because they accurately figured that waving a gun around was a great way to be shot by police. That, of course, didn't stop Katter from raging that \"My reaction [to Port Arthur] was rage and fury – wasn't there anyone there to help these people? Wasn't there anyone there to deal with this piece of scum?\"\nThat language is important, since the most illuminating thing that came across was just how unsuccessful Mental Health Week has been in educating people in how to talk about mental health in the media. Both Katter and Latham railed against dangerous \"nutcases\" and \"lunatics\", showing the same nuanced understanding of the subject as Brown, who jumped in apropos of nothing to call for firing squads \"…where we'll line up all the pedophiles\". Sorry, what?\nWith time ticking down the argument burnt out quickly enough as the subject turned to the addictiveness of pokies and whether they needed to be regulated.\nAgain, everyone pretty much agreed something should be done, although the solutions ranged from gambling limits (Rae) and education (Mollard) to Latham's demand that clubs to identify problem gamblers and then somehow magically force them to get help, and Brown's helpful and insightful declaration that gamblers have only themselves to blame, because \"I'm sick of their victim mentality. No-one puts a gun to their head.\" Seriously, Brown? What were you talking about mere minutes ago?\nRizvi gently added out that pokies are targeting an older demographic and that the bigger problem down the road is the increasing popularity of online gambling: a point eloquently made 90 seconds later during a commercial for the Crownbet app.\nMaybe it was the topics, or maybe it was the mix of panellists, but on tonight's evidence The Verdict needs either a whole lot of loose cannons spouting furious nonsense, which would be entertaining but pointless; or thoughtful experts who know what they're talking about, which would be interesting but also essentially make them Q&A. \nThe danger is that The Verdict are replacing car crash television with something even worse: boring television.\n“If I had my way, Port Arthur never would’ve occurred.” - @RealBobKatter #TheVerdict https://t.co/SkZ1K1NDgz \n— #TheVerdict (@TheVerdict9) October 22, 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:22:08.613+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
