(BBC) \nIwan ended up in a dance-off against Loose Women panellist and pop star Jamelia and her partner Tristan MacManus, as the two celebrities scored the lowest number of combined votes. \nThe athlete-turned-sports commentator, 41, and Ola performed the Cha Cha to Sexy And I Know It by LMFAO, which Bruno Tonioli branded ‚Äúmurder‚Äù and earned just 13 points. (BBC) \nDespite Iwan evidently not being the best dancer in the competition, viewers took to Twitter to lament his exit and that of fan favourite Ola. \nThis is the first time Ola has left the competition in week one. She feared she might not make it to the latest series at all after suffering a serious knee injury when she took part in winter sports show The Jump.
