You don't have the energy, we get it, but you've got a great excuse, Graham Norton's lineup is top class this week.

If you're lucky enough you'll remember exactly where it is you know Kenneth Branagh from, and Tom Hiddleston will be there to save the whole thing just by being Tom Hiddleston. Music from The Shires, nope, we've no idea who they are either, but we like the sound of a country-pop duo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T18:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:48:30.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
