The cause of the hoopla was putting her official ink signature to a modeling contract with GAWK Talent™.\nThe 5’11” slender teen with an athletic body-type, will become the face of Somorlov Cosmetics™ and Faith Bravo Fashion™. Alýssa commented after signing her contract about upcoming opportunities as a professional model.\n“I’m totally hyped to sign my first modeling contract with GAWK Talent,” she said. “I’m looking forward to my first project in early 2016 as a print model, initially.”\nKindhearted, funny, and admittedly a bit sarcastic, Alýssa brings her own unique style to the modeling industry. Mr. Brown said this about GAWK Talent's new model and his daughter. “Alýssa will certainly establish her own identity in this industry, but right now, I see her as a combination of supermodel and actress Cara Delevingne, and comedian, actress, and model Amy Schumer.”\nMr. Brown also stated the cosmetics and fashion industries are well-known to focus highly on physical appearance, but it’s more important for GAWK Talent to accentuate Alýssa’s inner beauty as well. “I believe Alýssa’s fresh, healthy look and lifestyle are at the forefront of the change I see in the modeling industry,” he said. “She’s highly versatile and diverse in her style and appearance. The great thing about Alýssa is that she can effortlessly transform from natural curls to straight hair, and from no makeup to…BAM!”\nA freshman at Kent State University, new model Alýssa Brown went on to stress the importance of her current academics. “College will always come first, but I’m looking forward to this modeling opportunity. Working with my dad as my manager will be really cool, too.”\nAbout GAWK Talent Management™: Founded in 2015 by David L.
