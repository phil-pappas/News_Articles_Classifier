PUBLISHED: 09:00, Sun, Oct 11, 2015 | UPDATED: 11:52, Sun, Oct 11, 2015 PH Jimi Hendrix smoking a cigarette \nBut the technical brain behind the guitarist's three studio albums also carried a camera, and, making the most of their exceptionally creative and genial working relationship captured the star at work in the studio. \nKramer first met Hendrix early in 1967 at the Olympic Studios in Barnes, south west London, a moment he has evoked by recalling Hendrix's white feather coat, presumably the height of fashion, sullied by the capital's damp, acrid air. PH Eddie Kramer helped Hendrix record 3 albums \nThe South Africa-born engineer, already a face on the 60s music scene having worked with The Beatles and the Stones, struck up an instant rapport with Hendrix and his group the Experience and went on to engineer their three remarkable albums Are You Experienced?, Axis: Bold As Love and Electric Ladyland between 1967 to 1969, the period these previously-unseen prints cover. \nHendrix's star rose rapidly in London but these shots have a candid and incidental look that describe the long nocturnal hours of endless takes and eureka moments. \nIn the spirit of the times, one close-up sees the star smoking a cigarette and quite another substance simultaneously. \nAccording to Kramer, the Seattle guitarist was the consummate gentleman, very shy and with a habit of holding a hand to his mouth when he laughed, but he was also a perfectionist with a computer-sharp mind who always got what he wanted. \nAnd crucially, Jimi had an acerbic wit that must have served him well around the sarcastic exchanges of the London studio scene.
