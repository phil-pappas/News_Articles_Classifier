FarrMore Content Now Posted Oct. 8, 2015 at 9:41 AM It feels so good to say this: Janet Jackson is back. Her latest album, “Unbreakable,” has debuted at No. 1. It’s on fire. It has been seven years since her last album. A lot has happened since then, including the loss of her brother Michael. The two siblings were very close and his passing had a prolonged effect on her. Michael truly respected Janet as an artist. In so many ways, their careers and style paralleled each other. It’s quite remarkable how similar the two were. She was perhaps the only one of theJackson siblings to escape Michael’s shadow. If anyone ever questioned Janet’s likeness to Michael, I suggest they get their hands on “Unbreakable.” It’s as if she was able to channel him through her into these impressive new tracks. Even the vocals and arrangements feel like Michael was right there with her, particularly the title track. It very well could have been one of Michael’s hits. It’s true that Michael and Janet possessed some of the same great magic, but let’s not forget she’s the one who took control of her career back in 1986, when she paired up with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis for her breakthrough album, “Control.” The magic conjured for “Control” was even greater for her stellar “Rhythm Nation 1814” in 1989. For “Unbreakable,” Janet re-enlisted the talents of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. The result is some of her best music to date, and that’s saying a lot for a woman whose albums play more like greatest hits collections than individual studio releases. The first single, “No Sleeep,” features J. Cole. It’s a typical Janet slow groove reminiscent of those heard on her 1993 album, “Janet,” complete with all the sexiness we’d expect. “Burnitup!” (feat. Missy Elliott), “Shoulda Known Better,”“2 B Loved” and “Night” pick up the pace like Janet can do. Love it! But just as she can groove hard, she also can take it to a level of almost sweet innocence, much like Michael could do. Cases in point: “After You Fall” and “Promise.” These tracks are definitely single-worthy. That being said, I saved the best for last. Something has been missing from the radio for a while, and it didn’t hit me what it was until I heard the tracks ”The Great Forever,”“Well Traveled” and “Gon’ B Alright.” Janet is what has been missing. Those tracks are hot, hot, hot. If radio fails to pick them up, shame on them. These are the songs I’ve waited all year to hear. Michael would be proud. Page 2 of 2 - I have been a fan of hers since she portrayed Penny on “Good Times” and Charlene on “Diff’rent Strokes.” I’ve listened to her grow up in her music, enjoyed all of her albums, songs and movies, too. She is one of the all-time greats, an icon. With all the ups and occasional downs, she truly is “Unbreakable.” Contact David T. Farr at farrboy@hotmail.com. By David T.
