Photo: AP \nMore on The Martian Movie session times Full movies coverage With NASA dropping its bombshell about finding water on Mars just as the film was about to open, The Martian is an uncommonly timely release. But here's a curious thing: it's not really a film about Mars at all. It's about Earth.\nThis isn't just a story about one man's struggle for survival on the red planet – not for nothing has it been called Robinson Crusoe on Mars – it's also, and very much so, an allegory about humankind's struggle for survival on its own blue-and-green one.\nEven more than the geekfest book on which it is based, Ridley Scott's film is a celebration of human ingenuity in the face of an environment that doesn't want to play nice. It's an optimistic tale about how science and imagination can redeem even the most hopeless situation. It's an upbeat fable about how we might just be able to think our way out of environmental disaster.\nAdvertisement \"We're treating science as a religion,\" Drew Goddard, who adapted Andy Weir's novel for the screen, said recently . \"It's less about [stranded astronaut and botanist] Mark [Watney] thinking he's so smart, and more about this is what he's devoted his life to, and he knows he may not have the answer but he knows how to get to the answer.\"\nWhich, let's face it, is what humanity as a whole needs if we're going to get through a future of rising oceans, forest fires, desertification and crop failure, right?\nThis is no tree-hugging lovefest, however. It's a hard-nosed call to tweak, build and invent our way out of catastrophe.\nThe pessimists would of course say it's too late, the planet has turned on us and we're all doomed anyway. But The Martian is about refusing to believe any problem – even one as large as global environmental collapse – is unsolvable.\nAs a NASA psychologist says of Watney's chances in the novel: \"The biggest threat is giving up hope. If he decides there's no chance to survive, he'll stop trying … if he's lost hope, he won't care about survival.\"\nWatney never gives up hope. Scott's film wants to make sure we don't either. But it's not blind hope it's advocating – not faith in some sort of divine intervention – but hope founded on the idea that smart thinking and collective action, rather than a blinkered concern for the bottom line, are what will get him (that is, us) through this.\nThe key moment in Scott's film comes when Watney assesses his situation and declares: \"I'm going to have to science the shit out of this planet.\"\nWe know this is the key moment because (a) it's obvious, (b) it foreshadows all that follows, and (c) Ridley Scott sent a version of it into space.\n(No slouch as a draftsman, Scott had doodled an image of an astronaut on the title page of the screenplay, with a speech bubble saying \"I'm going to science the shit out of this planet\". That page was carried into orbit aboard a December 2014 test flight of NASA's Orion spacecraft, the vehicle that is eventually expected to carry human settlers to Mars.)\nThere's another key line in the film, where Watney says you have a choice when you're confronted with a massive dilemma like the one he faces. \"You can lie down and die or you can fight.\"\nWatney is not meant to be your average Joe – he's one of the best. \"He's very intelligent,\" says that NASA psychologist, Irene Shields, in Weir's novel. \"He's particularly resourceful and a good problem solver … He's a good-natured guy … Mark not only fits well in any social group, he's a catalyst to make the group work better.\"\nSo, to solve our problems we need the best minds, but we also need collective thought and action, people coming together for the common good.\nMars is cold. It is dry ( though Scott claims he knew about water on Mars months ago , there's no mention of it in the film.) It suffers horrendous dust storms.\nWatney has to think his way through all of these. He uses his faeces to turn the planet's sterile soil into fertile ground for a crop of potatoes. He harvests his urine to make water. He turns potentially poisonous gases into oxygen and fuel and water. He taps into solar and nuclear energy. He recycles and repurposes old and damaged gear to lessen his isolation and increase his chances of survival. Some things work and many things fail. But he never stops trying.\nThe rescue mission mounted by NASA with the help of the Chinese (how's that for working together?) is unbelievably expensive. But, as NASA's communications manager, played in the film by Kristen Wiig​, says in Weir's novel: \"It's not about the bottom line. It's about a human life in immediate danger.\"\nTake out the indefinite article and she could be arguing against those who resist action on climate change because it's deemed too costly.\n\"But if you want to look at it financially,\" she continues, \"consider the value of Mark Watney's extended mission. His prolonged mission and fight for survival are giving us more knowledge about Mars than the rest of the [space] program combined.\"\nIn other words, radical thinking in response to a crisis can have unanticipated pay-offs. Like, say, an economy that, confronted by dangerously rising emissions, decides to develop clean alternative energy … could that have pay-offs beyond the initial cost outlay, perhaps? Hmm.\nFundamentally, The Martian is about a mindset. Accept that the game is over and you can either throw your hands up in despair or eat your way through your rations as fast as you can. Refuse to accept that the game is over and the planet has a fight on its hands.\n\"The frigid desert has been my home for a year and a half,\" says Watney as he awaits his last shot at rescue. \"I figured out how to survive, at least for a while, and I got used to how things worked. My terrifying struggle to stay alive became somehow routine … [Now] I have no more jobs to do, and no more nature to defeat.\"\nHere's hoping we can take a leaf and adopt some Watney-esque thinking back on Earth. If we don't, we may soon find we have no more nature to defeat, or to savour, either.\nFollow Karl Quinn on twitter: @karlkwin \nOn Facebook: karl quinn writer", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:51:43.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
