Idris Elba (Arthur Mola/Invision) \nThe exhibition, which often influences the fashions worn by the rich and famous who attend the gala, is titled, “manus x machina: fashion in an age of technology”. It will be on view from May 5 through August 14 of next year. \nThe event is a star-studded occasion to rival the big Hollywood awards nights, and the 2015 gala was attended by the likes of Beyonce, Madonna, Lady Gaga, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. Beyonce at the 2015 Met Gala (Charles Sykes/Invision) \nApple is helping fund the exhibition, which — according to a news release — “will explore the impact of new technology on fashion and how designers are reconciling the handmade and the machine-made in the creation of haute couture and avant-garde ready-to-wear”. \nThe exhibition will feature more than 100 examples, from a 1880s Worth gown to a 2015 Chanel suit. It will explore the influence of the invention of the sewing machine in the 19th century, bringing on distinctions between machine-made and handmade at the onset of mass production.
