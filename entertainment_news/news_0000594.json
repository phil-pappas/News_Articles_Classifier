And tonight's episode was the most preposterous, and the most gripping, yet.This was the episode when it all got too much for Gemma (Suranne Jones). Well, wouldn't it get a bit much for you, if your philandering husband – who'd apparently stopped philandering, and indeed who'd denied philandering all along – started philandering again? Especially if you saw him, with your own eyes, snogging his tarty young girlfriend on a park bench like a pair of schoolkids.So Gemma went to the seaside.The ocean-shore female-lead burnout was, of course, perfected by Cagney & Lacey 's Mary Beth (Tyne Daly) as a dramatic device in the early 1980s, when she worried poor Harv half to death with her disappearance. But Mary Beth, if memory serves, hung out with an annoying artist woman for a bit, then went home. Gemma took things one step further by walking out into the sea, in manner of hopeless case about to kill self.[caption id=\"attachment_490440706\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] Suranne Jones, star of BBC One's Doctor Foster (Photo by Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images)[/caption]However, fortunately for next week's final episode – which might have been a bit anticlimactic if it consisted solely of the alcoholic old doctor Jack (Robert Pugh) discussing funeral arrangements with philandering husband Simon (Bertie Carvel) – Gemma came back. Indeed, despite having plunged deep under the waves, and despite still being fully clothed, she didn't seem any the worse for wear. (Except of course for her hairdo, which was a bit bedraggled. But then if you ask me, it didn't really work in the first place – too wavy at the ends for such a short bob.)So back Gemma went to Parminster and – by some contrivance that I didn't quite understand, involving an emailed invitation, a diary snafu, and a fortuitously coincidental family gathering – ended up at dinner with Simon, his tarty young girlfriend, and the tarty young girlfriend's parents. Who, of course, aren't in on the affair. (Unless Simon's assistant has told them, but I don't think she has.)Which leaves everything poised deliciously for next week's finale – so deliciously, in fact, that it might even out-delicious the Bake Off . I'm aching for a showdown over that family-style bowl of pasta. Screaming, shouting. Possibly even – given that Gemma's involved – the brandishing of scissors or lit cigarettes.Writer Mike Bartlett has given Gemma so many facets, though, that it's impossible to predict which way she'll turn.For example: I've been deeply suspicious – since the end of episode 3, and that horrifyingly syrupy reunion between Gemma and Simon after the death of his mother – that we're not being told everything there is to know about Gemma, her motivations and her intentions.Obviously she really needs to end up with the big house and its nasty glass-panelled dining room doors, and Simon bankrupt out on the street. But then again, that would cruelly deny their young son the happy ending he deserves.And so many stories to tie up, not least about Gemma's relentless medical malpractice. If there's any justice at all for her patients, she'll get struck off as well as divorced. Though that would make the title of any second series a bit of a problem – The Former Doctor Formerly Called Foster doesn't quite have the same ring to it. The ratings: Just a few years ago, Wednesday was a difficult night for BBC One. With no episode of EastEnders or Friday entertainment block to anchor it, BBC One's Wednesday-night schedule was just a bit thin.For the autumn season, though, two BBC Two reality transfers – the Bake Off and The Apprentice – have now fixed that. The Bake Off , in fact, is Britain's biggest ratings smash, consolidating at an eye-watering 12 million viewers plus.And Doctor Foster gives BBC One a big drama hit on Wednesdays, too, capitalising on its inherited audience from Bake Off and consolidating at over 7million viewers.That serendipity is only possible, by the way, with a linear schedule: you've watched the Bake Off at 8pm, so we think you might like this new drama at 9pm. This kind of blockbuster success makes me wonder, in fact, why BBC director-general Tony Hall seems so oddly lukewarm about the future of linear TV.", "external_links": ["http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/490440706/640x0.jpg?fit=scale"], "published": "2015-10-01T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:42:39.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
