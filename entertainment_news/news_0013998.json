Addis has released The Eaton, a terrifying new novel spanning over 100 years of mid-Michigan history, written in the gruesome style of '80s horror classics. The novel is the first publication of AE Press, a division of Addis' design & marketing firm, AE: Adventures in New Media. Originally planned as a personal project with a limited release, Addis was encouraged by Kory M. Shrum, author of the popular Dying for a Living series, to submit advanced copies to professional reviewers online. The extraordinary enthusiasm from these early reviewers encouraged AE Press to expand distribution of The Eaton to all major outlets.\n\"The Eaton is the best kind of horror,\" writes Bill Mackela in his five-star review on Bill's Book Reviews. \"This book is so well plotted, and the characters feel so real, that you will be as terrorized as they are. You will have to keep reading to see what happens next, even if you are afraid to find out.\"\nOther popular sites have offered similar five-star ratings, from FangFreakinTastic Reviews who \"would recommend The Eaton to anyone who loves a good horror story with rich, well-developed characters,\" to British author Catherine Rose Putsche calling The Eaton \"fast paced, macabre and full of gritty atmospheric settings, along with a relentlessly chilling plot from an author who's mastered the genre.\"\nThe Eaton tells the story of Sam Spicer, who purchases the dilapidated Michigan Central Railroad Depot in Eaton Rapids with the dream of opening a hot new martini bar. But when he and his friends discover an abandoned underground hotel directly beneath the property, they must discover what happened to the original guests--before their own time runs out.\nAlthough The Eaton is Addis' first full-length novel, he has authored a variety of Michigan-themed projects in the past, from his daily comic strip Studentangle which ran in Michigan State University's The State News, to writing and directing the feature length microbudget film The Bells of Beaumont Tower, which Unspeakable Magazine called \"one hell of a story--I really can't begin to express how cool I felt that this film was.\" His next project is the upcoming novel The Paper, which takes place in his Macomb County hometown of New Haven.\n\"Michigan, particularly mid-Michigan, always seems underrepresented in literature,\" explains Addis. \"But we have such a rich history here, with such diversity in our people and culture, so it seems a shame not to invent some great new stories with Michigan characters.\"\nThe Eaton is currently available directly from AE, and through Amazon.com in print and eBook, with additional national distribution through Barnes & Noble, Audible, and iBooks by the end of the year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:35:39.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
