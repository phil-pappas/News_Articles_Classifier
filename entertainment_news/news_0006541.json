The Fourth Trimester Bodies Project photographs mothers and documents their narratives of joy, grief and transition. The Honest Body Project does similar work, as does the powerful A Beautiful Body Project .\nSonrode views such groups as allies, and is reaching out to them to join forces.\n\"We're not reinventing the wheel,\" she said. \"We are taking this energy that's built up and saying, 'Let's change the perception together.' We're not saying, 'Hey, let's rise to the top.' We're saying, 'Hey, join us.'\"\nThe more the mightier, I say, especially when you're battling powerful, entrenched forces like the multimillion-dollar retail and beauty industries, which are egged on by magazines — of the celebrity gossip and fashion variety — that hold up endless examples of toned, taut, tiny post-baby bodies for women to aspire to.\n\"I have so many dreams for this movement,\" Sonrode told me. \"If we make even one woman feel better about herself, mission accomplished. But what I really want to do is shift the conversation about 'body after baby' to ask, 'Why? Why are we focused on getting our bodies back to the way they used to be?'\n\"Hopefully, we can encourage and empower not just mothers, but others to look at postpartum bodies as something women have earned,\" she continued. \"I do think we could see the pendulum swing. It's going to be a slow swing, but if enough of us are willing to say, 'This is what I look like under my clothes,' I think we can make a difference.\"\nhstevens@tribpub.com\nTwitter @heidistevens13\n Family", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561fc84f/turbine/ct-mid-drift-documentary-body-image-balancing-20151015", "http://www.middriftmovement.com/about/"], "published": "2015-10-15T18:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:12:22.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
