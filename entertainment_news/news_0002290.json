To those who are tying the knot, arranging a wedding might seem to end at what they alone plan but the seemingly small things like décor, dances and dressing all call for other people who in most cases are experienced in the various areas. And a choreographer is one such person who defines how a wedding can go and roll to perfection without glitches. \nOften times, you hear people remarking how a certain wedding did not live up to its billing after the choreography would have been in proper place. And in comes Zhungu whose skills as a wedding choreographer have made many a weddings memorable. The 25-year-old said he started dancing at a tender age. \nHe said choreography is a job that if taken seriously is just like any other career and he is grateful to his day time boss for understanding the demands of his other profession. \n“I am a part time choreographer and use my weekends for that. I learnt to dance at church with my friends when we could change the gospel song dances mixing them with dances normally associated with rhumba, dancehall and jazz fusion. \n“Choreography as the art or job of deciding how dancers will move in a performance, is an art on its own and it requires one to be creative and also love it. You cannot be a good choreographer if you don’t enjoy the dances and other moves you would teach to the dancers. And also since dances are an integral part of weddings, what this means is that these should be executed in the best of finesses,” he said. \nThis probably explains the reason why he has conducted many bridal parties in his career as a choreographer, a feat which some other people in his profession are yet to achieve. But what is that sets him apart from other wedding choreographers? \n“I think it is important to first understand the bridal couple, their life, interests and tastes and this is what you can then craft your dances around. I also try by all means to avoid provoking the guests through the dances that should be sober and sane to fit the occasion,” he said. \nZhungu said he also made it a habit to always have a discerning ear for the latest songs which he said he then uses as accompaniment to his choreography. “As a dancer you need to move with times. Knowing what people need at the right time is important and deciding together with the bridal couple on how best they can do their things, are all a part of what defines choreography,” he said. \nFor Shungu the ever constricting global village means that his dances must reflect that cultural dynamism. “Who would not love to see the dancers at the wedding doing the Michael Jackson moves when the wedding is themed around the Old Skool days of life? As a choreographer, I also help the newly-weds in coming up with moves that reflect the concept of the occasion. I derive concepts for choreographing from countries like Nigeria, India and the United States, among others, as part of spicing up the whole thing. And with fashion also being an integral part of weddings, I try to make sure that the dances cue up with the fashion. My dances are mainly rhumba, Azonton (Nigerian inspiration) Jazz, contemporary, hip hop, Bollywood,” he said. \nThe Queensdale-based choreographer said he uses his art beyond teaching dance moves. “This is not just dancing; it also involves teaching people about life. Dancing is a great way to strengthen bones and muscles, improve balance and stay healthy in general. Dancing is also an activity that is appropriate for nearly everyone because it’s so easy to vary the intensity based on fitness level and ability. Simply by increasing the dance tempo or adding a turn or dip, dancers can increase the intensity and get more of a physical benefit,” he said. He said was inspired by two men in his life. \n“My dad is my role model. He motivates me to be better and challenges me to be the best. He is a man of integrity and fully supports my dancing and choreographing. I was taught how to be a choreographer by Marvin Chadzingwa from Cranborne. The man is talented and I don’t remember how many so far has passed through his hands,” he said. Zhungu records his success in costumes. He owns 18 wedding suits. \n“My contract is very simple, I coach dances and sometimes the groom might want me to be part of his bridal team so they buy me the complete outfit needed in addition to my normal charges. I have done 28 weddings and still going. Right now I have four more weddings to work on before the end of year. My lessons are two to three hours long depending on how flexible the team is but believe you me everyone is born a dancer, shaking your hands or head while bathing is dancing,” he said. \nThe young man said he has since diversified into being a wedding accessory service provider. “I use opportunities where ever I see them. Right now I am into buying and selling and hiring out wedding accessories such as bow-ties, suit clips, flowers, pocket squares, lapels, hair clips and crowns among other things. I am getting my stuff from Tanzania, South Africa, Zambia and Mozambique,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:27:37.238+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
