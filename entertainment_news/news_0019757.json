No. No they don’t. \nTHE author of an unauthorised biography of Beyoncé says that despite rumours that Jay Z cheated, Bey would never tolerate it. \nOne bombshell revealed in J Randy Taraborrelli’s book Becoming Beyoncé is about a rumoured Jay Z fling with protégée Rihanna when she was just 17. \n“It was total fiction,” the author told Entertainment Tonight , claiming a publicist concocted the tale to boost Rihanna’s career. But, “ Beyoncé didn’t know what to make of this and it actually ended up breaking them up for a time. They spent maybe a year apart from each other because Beyoncé just wasn’t sure of what to make of the situation with Rihanna.” With baby Blue Ivy. It was all just a rumour. \nNow, “It’s safe to say that Rihanna and Beyoncé are friends.” \nHe adds RiRi was partially to blame for Jay’s infamous elevator fight with Beyoncé’s sister Solange in 2014. \n“People told me that there was a whispered argument that night having to do with Jay wanting to go to a party [for] Rihanna,” he said. “Beyoncé did what Beyoncé does. She laid down the law ... it was a whispered married couple’s argument that would’ve gone by completely unnoticed had not Solange overheard it.” Other Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T09:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T11:06:40.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
