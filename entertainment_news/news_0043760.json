The rest of us fell by the wayside and she was still dry eyed, bushy tailed.\"\nOn Berry being named FHM's 74th sexiest woman in the world, she said: \"Listen, you don't get to see Mary's booty because we film from the waist up but she rocks it. She can twerk until the cows come home. No, she has got it. I'm annoyed she isn't higher. The campaign starts now.\"\nShe called finalist Tamal Ray \"gorgeous\", adding: \"He is beautiful. He will not be single for long that boy.\"\nTalking about series six winner Nadiya Jamir Hussain, Perkins said she \"slowly bloomed\" during the show.\nShe said: \"She made a beautiful peacock. She made fizzing cans of pop. She had no confidence and she slowly bloomed and she delivered and she is a beautiful, beautiful woman and made some great bakes.
