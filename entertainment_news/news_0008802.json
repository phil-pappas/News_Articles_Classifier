When Julia, a young violinist, first picks up some mysterious sheet music in an Italian antique shop, she has no concept of the dark and twisted journey ahead. Musical references and lingo abound in this intriguing thriller by the author of the Rizzoli & Isles series. Gerritsen delivers a novel full of the emotional and psychological suspense that has become her hallmark, combined with a haunting musical leitmotif throughout its pages. \n“Playing with Fire” and other titles by the author will be available for purchase and signing.
