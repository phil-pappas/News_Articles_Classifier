The charges carry a penalty of six months in jail.\nBieber, who became a pop sensation through YouTube videos at age 15, is known for numerous paparazzi run-ins involving reckless driving. In 2013, a photographer trailing the \"Boyfriend\" singer's white Ferrari in Los Angeles was killed after he crossed a busy highway to snap photos of the car.\nCanadian-born Bieber, 21, said at the time he hoped the incident would \"inspire meaningful legislation\" to protect the celebrities being hounded as well as the photographers.\n(Editing by Victoria Cavaliere and Miral Fahmy )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T08:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T07:42:34.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
