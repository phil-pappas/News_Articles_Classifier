According to a source, the “Mirrors” hitmaker, who has taken the last few months off to bond with his five-month-old son Silas, is eager to make a splash when he returns to the spotlight and thinks hosting the prestigious awards ceremony on February 28, 2016 is the perfect platform for him, reports femalefirst.co.uk “Justin is campaigning hard with producers and is billing himself as the total package. He’s playing up the fact that he’s a singer, dancer and actor. Plus he bridges the gap between old and young,” the source told Star magazine. Timberlake is said to be confident he will be able to entertain the star-studded audience, as well as millions of viewers worldwide. “Justin says he’s not scared that so many hosts, like Neil Patrick Harris, ended up bombing. Producers are starting to agree that his confidence may just be the magic touch,” the source added.
