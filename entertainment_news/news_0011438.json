The 59-year-old was asked by Access Hollywood what the family's reaction has been to the couple's decision to give their marriage another go, and said simply, \"Nothing but love.\" Khloe, 31, and Lamar, 35, tied the knot on national TV in September 2009. The marriage fell apart after the former basketball player's cheating scandal and drug relapse, which resulted in the reality star filing for divorce in 2013. The couple signed divorce papers in July this year, but it was not until recently that it was revealed Khloe and Lamar are still legally married since their divorce papers have not yet been signed by the judge. It has been reported before that Khloe's laywer Laura Wasser went before a judge Wednesday morning, October 21, asking a judge to withdraw the papers they both signed to end their marriage. The request was granted by a Los Angeles judge. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:54:37.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
