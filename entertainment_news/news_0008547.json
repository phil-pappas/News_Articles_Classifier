Until January 31, 2016.\nSurrealism arose in a world that was out of joint, plagued by war and economic crisis, it was a child of the age of uncertainty. In that world, creative people had an obligation to go beyond the existing civilised, rational everyday order, which had so obviously failed, and to create a new reality drawing on unconscious urges, laws of chance and the world of dreams.\nThe triumph of classical modernism with its formalist principles and cool sensibilities rejected the chaos, anarchy and violence of Surrealism and appeared as the prevailing orthodoxy in the latter part of the 20th century. Surrealism asserted its strongest impact on Australian art during two periods of great uncertainty, the 1930s and the early 1940s, when the Great Depression and World War II dominated our psyche, and the present age, where once more economic uncertainty looms and war threatens.  \nRosslynd Piggott's, High bed (1998), is on display at the National Gallery of Victoria. Photo: act\\ron.cerabona \nThe exhibition Lurid Beauty  brings together about 200 items – including paintings, drawings, collages and sculptures, as well as examples of fashion, film, photography, theatre and performance art – all by Australian artists from the 1930s through to the present. The curious title, Lurid Beauty , comes from a verse by South Australia-based Surrealist poet Max Harris, who in 1940 wrote: \"Let me not call you lovely. Be the chaos of the dream that knows nor nature nor lurid beauty.\"\nAdvertisement It is an exhibition of unexpected juxtapositions. Entering through an installation by young artist Alex Vivian, visitors encounter a strange mix of classical Surrealism and contemporary art in this extensive, sprawling show.  One needs to suspend strict art historical categorisation and adopt the broadest notion of Surrealism, as one of the participant artists, Peter Ellis noted: \"Surrealism is not an 'art movement', but a state of mind and a way of life\".  \nIt is a bold, brilliant and challenging exhibition, in which meaning resides in the seams between the various systems of visualisation. It is a rich and unexpected fabric of Australian visual culture, rather than a tired rehash of the established litany of Australian Surrealism. Of course we have included the traditional canon of Australian Surrealists, with James Gleeson at its head, followed by Max Dupain, Robert Klippel, Sam Atyeo, Peter Purves-Smith, James Cant, Roy de Maistre, Eric Thake, Ivor Francis and early Sidney Nolan collages. However, a host of artists whose work has been largely neglected are also in the show, including the Marek brothers, Dusan and Voitre​, Petr Herel, Erwin Fabian, Herbert McClintock, Helen Maudsley, Vivienne Binns and the wonderful expatriate Australian artist, who has been essentially forgotten in this country, Clifford Bayliss.\nPat Brassington, \"Voicing\" (2001) from the \"Gentle\" series (2001) 1/4, in Lurid Beauty: Australian Surrealism and its echoes at the National Gallery of Victoria.

Works spark off one another, whether this be the Mangano twin sisters' weird performance, Rosslynd Piggott's overpowering installation  High bed , Fiona Hall's challenging sardine cans or Pat Brassington's disturbing digital prints. The unifying element is the conviction that everyday reality has failed us. The thin facade of civilisation is crumbling and what peeps out from underneath is a highly disturbing world, ruled by chaos and uncertainty. This exhibition plays with your senses and questions your perception of reality. The \"uncanny\" emerges as a key concept in contemporary art practice, the unfamiliar familiar, sometimes in a more playful and ironic manner – as in the work of Tom Moore and Judith Wright – but more frequently in a slightly menacing way as in the work of Jill Orr, Julie Rrap, Pat Brassington and Claire Lambe.  Anne Wallace may illustrate the uncanny narrative, but in the work of Susan Norrie and Louise Hearman, we live the experience.  \nIt is essentially a visual approach to curating an exhibition, rather than a theory-driven, cerebral approach. It is a high-risk strategy, which in this instance is brilliantly successful. Familiar art objects, for example, Inge King's Flower dancer , 1948, are given a new meaning in this context, and largely unfamiliar works, such as Lou Hubbard's chilling video, Bore me , 2007, despite its well established Surrealist antecedents, confronts and disturbs its viewers.\nWhen Surrealism made early inroads into Australian visual culture in the 1930s and was branded by conservatives as the end of civilisation as we know it, art made by degenerates and perverts, they were correct to the extent that it challenged fundamentally the existing order. This challenge is timely and relevant Artists of today are devising new strategies, technologies and materials, but their message has remained urgent and is designed to shock society out of its complacency. It is an unforgettable show that challenges the way we see our world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:21:57.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
