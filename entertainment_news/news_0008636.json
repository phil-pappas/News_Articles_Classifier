This sweet dog thought she had a \"forever\" home, even though her family paid little attention to her and kept her chained up outdoors for most of her life. They named her \"Black Girl\", and although life wasn't perfect, she still had a safe home where she was properly fed.\nFor an unknown reason, just a few weeks ago, Black Girl was no longer wanted. The dog's former owner just decided she didn't want her dog, leashed her up and brought her back to Miami-Dade Animal Services; knowing that the shelter was overcrowded and her dog's future would be in dire jeopardy. With a flick of the leash turned over to the staff at the shelter, Bettie was discarded. Sadly, Bettie never did anything wrong; she never showed any aggressive behavior, she never ran away, and she always wagged her tail in spite of mostly having been ignored.\nClick here for Bettie's PetHarbor listing. BETTIE - ID#A1144943 \" I am a spayed female, black and white Labrador Retriever mix. The shelter staff think I am about 7 years old. I have been at the shelter since Sep 17, 2015.
