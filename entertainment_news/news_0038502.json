It follows a woman living a self-imposed, vagabond existence with a pack of dogs on the edge of Buenos Aires. The film follows this hermit across four seasons as she patches up her makeshift shack in the woods, communes with nature, and forages for (and sometimes steals) food, making only the briefest of forays into the city and only fleetingly engaging with other people. Dog Lady is filmed with an attentive and sympathetic eye, yet it is careful never to explain its subject.\nFor more interesting Hollywood news and pictures follow us on Pinterest>>> timesofindia\nFor latest Hollywood updates follow us on G+ >>> The Times of India Entertainment\nAbout Laura Citarella\nLaura Citarella (1981) is a member of the production company El Pampero Cine, along with Mariano Llinas, Alejo Moguillansky and Agustin Mendilaharzu.
