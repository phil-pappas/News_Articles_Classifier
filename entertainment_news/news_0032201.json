(Originally published by the Daily News on November 28, 2000.)\nAnyone running into David Blaine in Times Square is in for a chilly reception.\nThe illusionist encased himself in 6 tons of ice yesterday and plans to stay there until he is cut out with chain saws on national television tomorrow night.\nThe frigid stunt is the ultimate test for Blaine, 26, who was likened to Harry Houdini last year after he buried himself alive in a plastic tomb for a week.\nDAVID BLAINE IS OKAY AFTER ICE STUNT\n\"I like to confront every human fear. That's the point,\" Blaine said yesterday morning, a tad nervously, in front of scores of reporters and TV cameras.\n\"I don't consider myself an illusionist or a magician or any of that,\" he said. \"It's just an endurance stunt.\"\nDressed in cargo pants, insulated boots and a wool cap, Blaine kissed and hugged his jittery girlfriend, Josie Maran.\n\"Go home, get some sleep. I'll be all right,\" he told her.\nA crowd of amateur magicians, tourists and passersby began gathering around 7 a.m. at 44th St. and Broadway as the 8-foot-high, 6-foot-thick chunk of Alaskan glacier was set up for the stunt.\nNew York Daily News The New York Daily News published this article on Nov. 28, 2000.

Previous Next Enlarge \"He's got entirely too much time on his hands,\" said Michelle Francis, a coffee shop worker.\nThe ice, ventilated on top and bottom, was split into two pieces. A chamber was hollowed out in each just big enough for the 6-foot-1, 185-pound Blaine to stand inside.\nBlaine, who has practiced sleeping standing up, said he was going to try to avoid sleeping. Plastic straps and belts would keep him suspended 2 inches from the ice - contact would result in severe frostbite.\nSeveral spectators wondered whether they were seeing a hoax made possible by hot air pumped into the ice block. Other magicians haven't been impressed, either.\nAn E-mail message posted on a magicians' chat room recently characterized Blaine's ice act as an off-the-shelf stunt. Diagrams purporting to show how the stunt really works contended that a layer of hot air is pumped between the magician and the ice. As the ice melts, the free space grows, making the stunt easier as time passes.\nBlaine and his organizers, though, have denied that. The magician said that only fresh air is being pumped through holes to help him breathe.\nAnother hole provides access for a tube supplying water and hot liquids - Blaine's only nourishment. A catheter will suffice when nature calls.\nOnce the ice chamber was sealed, Blaine's meager clothing - and petroleum jelly smeared over his exposed skin - were his only defenses against near-freezing temperatures.\nThe lack of food - Blaine ate his last meal on Thanksgiving - put the daredevil at high risk for exhaustion, blood clots, stomach ulcers and, of course, hypothermia.\nMichael Schwartz Baline enters the small chamber inside the halves.

They touched his frozen berth, which ice bags helped keep cold yesterday in 50-degree temperatures.\n\"I'm going to touch him all three days,\" said Nancy Mendoza, 25, of Manhattan's upper West Side. \"I love him.\"\nWhat's next for Blaine?\nHis girlfriend said the stunt is one of his 15 \"lifelong pursuits.\"\n\"He's going to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge next year,\" she said, \"and I think he may even try to take a bullet.\"\nThe defrosting will air live on \"David Blaine, Frozen in Time,\" on ABC-TV at 10 p.m. Wednesday.\nTags: archives", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:08:30.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
