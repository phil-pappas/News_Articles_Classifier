READ MORE: \nThe boyband had been due to play the first of three nights of their On The Road Again tour at the SSE Arena. \nOne Direction \nHowever, at around 9pm, fans were told the boys would not be taking to the stage, with a concert promoter telling the crowd: “The show tonight has been cancelled as Liam has taken ill, and whilst not serious, he is unable to perform tonight. \n“The band apologise to the fans and wish Liam better.\" \nConcert goers have been told to hold on to their tickets, with a further announcement expected on Wednesday morning. \nMany disappointed fans were left hysterical at the news, with reports of many bursting into tears, while others booed as they were asked to leave. \nOther fans took to Twitter to wish Liam a speedy recovery, and #GetWellSoonLiam began trending on the social networking site. \nLiam Payne \nEamonn Holmes also echoed the sentiments of many angry fans and parents - many of whom had paid up to £140 for tickets - slamming the rest of the group for not announcing the news themselves. \nHe tweeted: “I don't care who was sick in #OneDirection. Rest of them should have had the decency & maturity to appear on stage and explain.” I don't care who was sick in #OneDirection Direction. Rest of them should have had the decency & maturity to appear on stage and explain. \nHarry Styles , Louis Tomlinson and Niall Horan did later take to Twitter to send their apologies: Deepest apologies to everyone at the show tonight in Belfast. Very disappointed, but unfortunately these things happen. We're very sorry. H \n— Harry Styles. (@Harry_Styles) October 20, 2015 We're so so sorry for what happened tonight, it was out of our control !

Unfortunately these things happen... Thank you to all who came down tonight ! \n— Niall Horan (@NiallOfficial) October 20, 2015 \nThey later attempted to make things up to them by releasing the video to their new single 'Perfect', which premiered on Vevo shortly after the concert was cancelled. \nWatch it below... One Direction's Most Controversial Moments of   It might be surprising to recall that Zayn's inclusion in One Direction wasn't actually all that well-received, given that he'd refused to dance at boot camp, walking out rather than finishing his choreographed routine. Even Mary Byrne gave it a jaunty shimmy, Zayn! One Direction and short-lived rivals The Wanted had a long-standing feud, which peaked when Zayn called their lead singer, Max George, \"chlamydia boy\" during a heated Twitter row. Eventually Jay McGuinness stepped in, urging Louis Tomlinson and Zayn to \"stop mentioning us in your gigs\", adding: \"We certainly no longer mention you and it's time to let dead dogs lie.\" Liam was forced to apologise to fans over this photo, which showed him standing on a window ledge, overlooking East London. He tweeted: \"You may have seen a photo of me today taken on top of a building. I regret being there and having the photo taken. \"It was a stupid and irresponsible thing to do. I am sorry...\" Zayn and Louis landed themselves in hot water last year, when a video surfaced online, showing the twosome smoking a dodgy-looking cigarette, while Louis said to the camera: \"So here we are, leaving Peru. Joint lit. Happy days!\" Louis can also be heard joking that “Mary J” - a slang term for marijuana - is “one very very important factor of Zayn’s warm up”. Harry Styles' Twitter followers weren't impressed with this photo, showing him sporting a traditional Native American headdress, with many accusing him of cultural appropriation. He later deleted the picture from his social media accounts. Miley might have provided one of the most outrageous moments in VMAs history back in 2013, but it's often overlooked that she actually left the ceremony early. Hinting on Twitter that something may be afoot, she wrote: \"Leaving the VMAs. No it's not over. I'm no psychic but congrats @onedirection #songofthesummer\" Call her Mystic Meg, because 1D only went and won, didn't they? We're sure it was just a coincidence... A journalist for The Independent noticed that Louis was sporting a t-shirt with the Apple logo on, but emblazoned in rainbow colours, she speculated it might be a mark of solidarity with the company's CEO, who had recently come out. Louis, unfortunately, totally misread the situation, and took it as accusations that he himself was gay, tweeting the journalist directly and writing: \"I am in fact straight... Fucking ridiculous I even have to tweet that shit!\" You know what, Louis? You didn't have to. Zayn Malik found himself on the receiving end of death threats, after tweeting the message #FreePalestine out of the blue to his 13 million followers. Keep in mind this was before Zayn's Twitter page became a haven for, well, every thought that enters his head, as it currently is. Shortly after his fling with Caroline Flack, it was reported that he'd slept with another woman over a decade older him, this time radio DJ Lucy Horobin, who was married at the time. However, an insider later told the Sunday Mirror that Harry \"had no idea she was still married\". They might have been BFFs when they were still in One Direction, but once Zayn was gone from the group, he and Louis fell out spectacularly on Twitter, over music producer Naughty Boy. Zayn publicly told Louis to \"stop bitching\", writing to him publicly: \"Remember when you had a life and stopped making bitchy comments about mine?\" The two were later reported to have made up, but when Zayn fell out with Calvin Harris, Louis was there to make it clear he was on the DJ's side... Niall was at the centre of a controversy, after a video showed him greeting fans at Dublin airport with the unusual salutation of: \"You shower of c**ts.\" Although that sounds bad on paper, Niall did wish the same fans a 'happy birthday' in the video, and later insisted his comments were \"just banter\", tweeting: \"Really sorry if I caused any offence. It was just banter with fans who I think of more as mates. But I understand that it's not a word I should be using at all.\" The intros to 'What Makes You Beautiful', 'Live While We're Young' and 'Best Song Ever' all struck a chord with music fans, for their similarities to other songs. However, Hayley Williams took it a step further when she heard 'Steal My Girl' for the first time, tweeting: \"[The] beginning of that new 1D song couldn't sound any more like the beginning of @newfoundglory's \"its not your fault\" but...\" This behind-the-scenes snap from the 'Steal My Girl' video upset animal rights' activists, who were angered that the group had a chained monkey on the set of their music video. Although a 1D spokesperson was adamant that no animals were harmed, UK-based charity Wild Futures called for the video to be pulled altogether.
