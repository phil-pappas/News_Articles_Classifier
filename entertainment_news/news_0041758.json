Abrams -- who successfully rebooted the \"Star Trek\" franchise for the big screen -- is at the helm of \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens,\" which arrives in theatres Dec. 18.\nThe upcoming film takes place some 30 years after the events of \"Return of the Jedi,\" but the plot has remained shrouded in secrecy.\nThe trailer went online moments after its halftime premiere during \"Monday Night Football\" and has amassed more than 36 million views on the official \"Star Wars\" YouTube account.\nThe two-and-a-half-minute spot offers teases into the backstories of the series' newest characters including John Boyega's Finn, a stormtrooper who's questioning his allegiances, Daisy Ridley's scavenger Rey, seen exploring an old ship, and Adam Driver's Darth Vader-obsessed Kylo Ren.\n\"I'm amazed how J.J. has understood the world,\" Christian said backstage at Toronto's World MasterCard Fashion Week where he was a special guest judge in a \"Star Wars\" fashion contest.\n\"He's been so respectful of what the original 'Star Wars' was, and yet turned it into a whole new vision which is exactly what the world wants.\"\nChristian is the creator of two \"Star Wars\" icons: the lightsaber and robot R2-D2; both of which can be seen in the newest \"Star Wars\" trailer. The Englishman spoke with The Canadian Press about his reaction to the trailer and the origins of R2-D2.\nCP: When you're watching the trailer looking at the set designs and pieces in the new film, do you flash back to your experiences?\nChristian: Totally. The trailer before this one, when the laser sword ... that I made by hand for $9 was in the trailer, suddenly it's there in closeup. This is like 35 years later and these icons are coming around again.\nCP: It must have been fun for you to see R2-D2 popping up in \"The Force Awakens\" trailer. Tell us about the origins of R2-D2.\nChristian: That was the first thing we ever made on \"Star Wars\" -- ever. And for four months, there was only the designer and myself and one art director, and George and Gary -- and that was it for four months. We were in a little tiny studio trying to work out how in the hell to make this film with no money. And we realized that if R2-D2 didn't work -- and C-3PO -- George didn't have a film.... Radio control at that time was really primitive. We knew we had to have a person small enough to work it, and we found Kenny Baker who was only three-foot-eight and (with) very strong legs.\nI hired a carpenter, we had no money literally to buy wood. He had some marine ply(wood) at home and he made a wooden one, and I couldn't afford a top 'cause he said, \"Rog, I can't make a top, it's curved.\" So I found one in a junk pile in the electrician's and we stuck that on the top. And I put in air nozzles from old aircraft parts I found, stuck those in -- they're still there to this day -- and he has two little arms on the front.\nThe carpenter had me carve those at home at night with a pen knife because I couldn't get them made.... We eventually got him to walk through experimenting, and then that then became R2-D2.\nRelated Stories 'Star Wars' trailer not the first time Hollywood overshadowed NFL 'Star Wars' mania: Fans overwhelm ticket sites, new trailer goes viral", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:37:06.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
