He began the job May 18. \nRyan's arrival at the Warhol Museum was heralded, with the museum's director calling him \"one of the most dynamic young curators in America.\" \nThe 39-year-old Ryan went to Pittsburgh after serving as an assistant curator at Minneapolis' Walker Art Center. He appeared on the art magazine Apollo's 40 Under 40 U.S. list this year. \nRyan tells The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette he plans to remain in Pittsburgh and will work as an independent curator. \nMuseum officials say an international search for a new curator will begin as soon as possible.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:03:14.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
