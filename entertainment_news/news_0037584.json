Ebenhack, File)\nAUGUSTA, Georgia (AP) — Paine College interim president says the university could become the next school to rescind an honorary degree awarded to Bill Cosby.\nInterim President Samuel Sullivan told the Augusta Chronicle that the school’s board of trustees will vote on rescinding Cosby’s 2003 honorary doctorate during a meeting next week. Paine College is located in Augusta, Georgia.\nSullivan says numerous sexual assault allegations against the comedian have led the school’s leadership to consider revoking his degree.\nBaltimore’s Goucher College and Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts, both announced this week that they ha rescinded honorary degrees given to Cosby.\nCourt documents unsealed in July show the 78-year-old Cosby admitting extramarital relationships with several women, some of whom accuse him of sexual assault.\nCosby has never been charged with a crime.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:32:15.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
