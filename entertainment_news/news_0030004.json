In his new book Spade has revealed his run with stars including Sinead O’Conner, Patrick Swayze and Eddie Murphy. \nON 3 October 1992, singer Sinéad O’Connor created a scandal when, at the end of an performance on legendary US skit show Saturday Night Live she produced a photo of Pope John Paul II and proceeded to rip it into 10 tiny pieces. \n“Fight the real enemy!” she commanded, as the crowd in Rockefeller Centre's Studio 8H looked on in stunned silence — the first time a musical guest didn’t draw applause. \nBackstage, SNL honcho Lorne Michaels was nonchalant. He turned to cast member David Spade, shrugged, and said, “Irish.” \nDuring the next commercial break, Spade, who would go on to star in hit comedy shows including Rules of Engagement and Just Shoot Me! , walked onto the stage and grabbed one of the torn photo pieces. \n“This will be a nice memento if anyone ever remembers it happening,” Spade recalls thinking in his new memoir, Almost Interesting. \nThe next day, while doing laundry at his Upper West Side apartment, the comedian saw a report on current affairs show Inside Edition about the O’Connor incident. The news program had the actual photo, which had been taped together minus a single piece — Spade’s.
