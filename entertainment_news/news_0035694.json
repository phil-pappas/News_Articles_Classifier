The Evil Dead marathon kicks off with the original 1981 cult classic, The Evil Dead at 8:00pm ET/PT on STARZ. This seminal horror movie features five friends who go to a cabin in the woods where they find unspeakable evil lurking in the forest. They discover the Necronomicon, the Book of the Dead, which when translated releases a legion of demons and spirits. In order to survive the night, Ash must do battle with the evil dead. The marathon continues with the 1987 sequel, Evil Dead 2 at 9:30pm ET/PT. Ash, the lone survivor of the original demon attack, returns in the second chapter of the cult franchise. Armed with a chainsaw and a shotgun, he again must fight the evil dead when a group of strangers interrupt his romantic vacation in a lonely cabin in the woods. The Evil Dead marathon concludes with the 1992 third installment, Army of Darkness at 10:55pm ET/PT and a sneak peek at the first episode of the STARZ Original series \"Ash vs Evil Dead.\" In Army of Darkness, our hero, Ash, is transported back in time to 1300 A.D. and once again faces off against the evil unleashed. In order to return to the present and get back home, he must take up his chainsaw and \"boomstick\" to defeat the Deadites and return the Necronomicon to its final resting place. Fans will be encouraged to join the social media conversations throughout the night using #EvilDeadMarathon and other scene-specific hashtags that will appear within each movie. For fans that can't wait for the marathon, The Evil Dead is currently available on STARZ, STARZ PLAY and STARZ ON DEMAND and Evil Dead 2 will be available on STARZ PLAY and STARZ ON DEMAND from October 26 through October 30.

The series is executive produced by Sam Raimi, Rob Tapert, and Bruce Campbell, the original filmmakers of the franchise, and Craig DiGregorio who serves as executive producer and showrunner. Campbell reprises his role as Ash, the stock boy, aging lothario and chainsaw-handed monster hunter who has spent the last 30 years avoiding responsibility, maturity and the terrors of the Evil Dead. When a Deadite plague threatens to destroy all of mankind, Ash is finally forced to face his demons - personal and literal. Destiny, it turns out, has no plans to release the unlikely hero from its \"Evil\" grip.

Raimi directed the first episode of \"Ash vs Evil Dead\" that he wrote with Ivan Raimi (Darkman, Army of Darkness, Drag Me to Hell), and Tom Spezialy (\"Chuck,\" \"Reaper,\" \"Desperate Housewives\"). Raimi also serves as executive producer, with Rob Tapert (Evil Dead, \"Spartacus,\" Xena: Warrior Princess\") and Bruce Campbell (Evil Dead, \"Burn Notice\") along with Craig DiGregorio (\"Workaholics,\" \"Chuck\") who serves as executive producer/showrunner.
