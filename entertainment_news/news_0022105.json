Sexwale announced his intention to run today, two days ahead of the deadline for candidates to submit papers for the Feb. 26 emergency election to replace Sepp Blatter. \nFour other men have already submitted their papers: UEFA President Michel Platini, whose chances appear to have been thwarted by an ethics investigation, Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan, ex-FIFA official Jerome Champagne and David Nakhid of Trinidad and Tobago. \nSexwale was imprisoned on Robben Island alongside Nelson Mandela during apartheid. He later served as a South African cabinet minister and is currently a FIFA anti-racism adviser. The 62-year-old Sexwale is also a multi-millionaire businessman. \n  25, 2015 2:32 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T23:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:11:19.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
