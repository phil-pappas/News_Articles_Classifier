How much more can be glimpsed by perusing his massive cast of characters: four pages of them, more than 100 names of the great and small and smaller from Jimmy Carter to Bette Davis, Oliver North, Bob Strauss and Vigdís Finnbogadóttir, (once president of Iceland).\nOf this vast host, only nine characters are invented, the most important being Anders Little, a young deputy director of the National Security Council who has moved from “bland belief in coexistence toward implacable opposition to the Russians.”\nIn keeping with Nancy Reagan’s reliance on astrology — which Mallon makes both alarming and poignant — think of Ronald Reagan as the sun. Orbiting him in Finale are major planets like Richard Nixon, aging and exiled but eager to play the foreign-policy wise man; Pamela Harriman, the oft-wedded socialite and power broker whose “PamPAC” helped revive the Democratic Party in the ’80s; her fellow Brit the late Christopher Hitchens — journalist, incandescent wit and serial imbiber; the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev; and of course Nancy Reagan herself. All have their open and their hidden agendas.\nAlong with dozens of minor-asteroid characters who crisscross Reagan’s universe, they mull the perennial questions: Who is Reagan, anyway? What animates him? What there is there in the man?\nTwo major stories unfold in Finale : one tracking the historical record and the other delving into the private life of Anders Little . The more public story deals with the seminal events of Reagan’s second term: the 1986 arms-control summit with Gorbachev in Reykjavik, Iceland, and the Iran-Contra affair, which erupted that same year.\nAll the book’s key players have a stake in Iceland. Anders tags along as a stealth observer for the old cold warrior Nixon, who worries that Nancy Reagan and Secretary of State George Shultz will pressure the president into disastrous concessions. Hitchens arrives to report and issue cynical observations between cocktails, while Harriman knows that a successful summit for Reagan could scuttle her plans to help the Democrats take over the Senate in the ’86 midterms.\nThe Reykjavik summit produces some of Mallon’s best writing. While Ronald Reagan jousts with Gorby, citing the Russian proverb “ Doveryai no proveryai ” (trust but verify), Nancy is paralyzed by dread, wishing that the ordeal of office was over and she were “tucked away in that future library, just a mannequin in one of Jimmy Galanos’ red gowns, immobile and perfect, mutely greeting visitors.” Anders, taking notes as the leaders speak, reflects on the Rashomon effect that Reagan has on those who seek to fathom him. “They would describe Reagan’s mental terrain as being vastly more complicated than anything yet reckoned — or they would worry that the cupboard really was bare. The questions about him remained so basic, the hypotheses so far apart.”\nLike any historical novelist, Thomas Mallon can ride the fact train when he wants and jump off when he pleases, and perhaps only the most rigorous scholar of Reagan’s time will know exactly where the research ends and the inventing starts. But even readers who don’t remember the waning days of the Cold War will find masterful performances, by the author and by his subject, in Finale.\nDallas writer Chris Tucker teaches politics and history in Richland College’s Emeritus program.\nFinale: A Novel of the Reagan Years Thomas Mallon (Pantheon, $27. 95)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T05:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:49:40.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
