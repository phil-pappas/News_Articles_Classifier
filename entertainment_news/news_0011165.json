The actor has taken it upon himself to step out there and meet his fans... not just within the country but outside too. Upendra is currently on a tour abroad to promote his film Uppi 2 - one that has been met with mixed reviews. He recently enjoyed a screening with Kannadigas and fans living in Chicago .

Tweets about how the actor is so down-to-earth came up non stop.\nThe film Uppi 2 dwells on various possibilities of story threads, and Upendra, who has also written and directed the film has tried to convey two main things through this story.
