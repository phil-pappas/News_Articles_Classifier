The EP -- the Mutts' takes on Warren Zevon's \"Werewolves of London,\" a particularly intense \"I Put a Spell on You\" from Screamin' Jay Hawkins and, my personal favorite, a haunting take on \"Red Right Hand\" by Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds -- is available on iTunes and Bandcamp for $3, with free downloads available at Mutts shows.

North Ave., Chicago. $10-$12. (773) 278-6600 or subt.net .\nThe night starts here ... Canadian indie pop rockers Stars are a dichotomy. Sometimes they're fun, sometimes they're weighty; but the themes (both lyrical and musical) are always more complex than they seem on first listen. What is arguably the band's party anthem, \"Take Me to the Riot,\" smacks of a weekend of desperation at the same time as it's calling listeners to action. And the piece I think has the lightest, catchiest melody, \"Midnight Coward,\" is a duet about the awkwardness following a one-night stand, sung slyly and winningly by Amy Millan and Torquil Campbell. Stars plays two nights at Chicago's Lincoln Hall with San Francisco indie rock artist Geographer . 8 p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday, Oct. 13-14, at Lincoln Hall, 2424 N. Lincoln Ave., Chicago. $25.
