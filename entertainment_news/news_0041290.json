We don't really want to talk about Justin Bieber...\" \nWhen the confused hosts pushed Jade to explain why she was so reluctant to discuss Justin, she replied: \"We wanna, like, talk about our music, and then we get asked about him all the time. What's the point? What's the point? What's your point?\" \nShe and Jesy, 24, then walked out, with Perrie and Leigh-Anne Pinnock, 24, following closely behind them. \nBut the 'Black Magic' hitmakers returned to the studio minutes later laughing and revealed Kyle was also in on the joke, causing host Jack O to burst into tears. bang showbiz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:42:56.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
