Why would anyone do such a thing? That's what faith based film company WP Films is doing in their latest out-of-the-box move in a marathon event they’ve dubbed the #HolyShareathon. This event premieres October 17th, at 12:00 am Eastern Time, online only, at http://store.wpfilm.com/holyshareathon . Each film will air for one day only leading up to the release of Director Darren Wilson’s newest film, Holy Ghost Reborn. It was over eight years ago that Wilson first began his journey of making a movie featuring God doing what only He can do — the miraculous. \"I had no budget, no script, and no idea what this movie was ultimately going to look like,\" Wilson recalls. His only goal was to capture miracles on film, which he did, prompting his first movie, Finger of God, to go viral when it was released in 2007.\nSince that very first film, WP Film’s heartbeat is to see every one of the Father’s children come to know Him and His love through His son Jesus Christ. “We want to give everyone the opportunity to witness one man’s journey from skepticism to faith as God proves over and over again how far He will go to pursue His children to bring them back to Him.”\nMovie Schedule\nFinger of God: October 17th\nFurious Love: October 18th\nFather of Lights: October 19th\nHoly Ghost: October 20th\nCheck out the trailer HERE , and join the worldwide exclusive WP Film #HolyShareathon starting Saturday, October 17th, at 12:00 am EST only on http://store.wpfilm.com/holyshareathon\nAbout WP Films\nWP Films was founded by Darren Wilson in 2006 when he began work on what would become his first feature length film, Finger of God. The company currently concentrates on creating feature films that are both creatively exciting and spiritually engaging.", "external_links": ["http://store.wpfilm.com/holyshareathon", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3N0b3JlLndwZmlsbS5jb20vaG9seXNoYXJlYXRob24=", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g/dj16WHl5anNab0JtNCZmZWF0dXJlPXlvdXR1LmJl"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T15:19:50.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
