Terror Behind the Walls 2015 Terror Behind the Walls debuts two new attractions, Oct. 1, 2015. \nOnce inside the prison, Terror is broken into six different attractions — Lock Down, Infirmary, Detritus, Machine Shop, and this year's two new sections, Quarantine 4D and Break Out. \n\"As you leave Infirmary, you learn of a virus that every visitor will catch,\" said Amy Hollaman, reative director for Terror Behind the Walls. \"Then you enter Quarantine 4D.\" \nIf guests can escape the virus in Quarantine, they then must escape the prison itself through Break Out. \nHere are a few reasons why this haunted attraction is worth the visit this season. A real abandoned prison \nEastern State Penitentiary, which opened in 1829, has been described as the perfect setting for a haunted attraction. \nWith 30-foot, castle-like walls, the prison is like a silent fortress in the otherwise bustling Fairmount Avenue section of Philadelphia. \nIn its heyday, Eastern State was a one-of-a-kind, modern marvel, having running water even before the White House. \nBut as hundreds of thousands of prisoners moved through the one and only way in and out of the penitentiary, the building began to deteriorate. \nIn 1971, Eastern State was completely abandoned. \nToday, the atmosphere only adds to the creepiness of Terror Behind the Walls.

Looks that scare \nThe dilapidated stone walls and rusty bars that cover the meager cells make for a perfect setting for a haunted house. \nIt is eerie, but Terror Behind the Walls is more than just a stroll through an abandoned prison. \nThe story that unravels through the six attractions takes imagination and creativity to bring to life. \nFrom the hi-tech lighting and frightening sound track, to the realistic props and enchanting fog machines, guests become immersed in a bizarre world of darkness. \nOne example of the artistry that goes into making Terror what it has become is the new Quarantine 4D. \nWith the help of black lights and neon paint, the world of Quarantine jumps off the black walls in a glowing apocalypse of designs, props, and the characters who dwell there. Transformations \nEach of the approximately 250 actors who lurk in the cells and corridors of Terror are costumed from head to toe each night. \nMakeup Director Lauren Palmer, along with her team of 14 makeup artists, create zombie prisoners and guards, bloody doctors and nurses, and mythological creatures who glow in the dark to greet guests at every show. \nCostume director Keith Lambert and his assistant outfit every actor with prison scrubs, guard uniforms, even disguises that are designed to blend in with the surroundings so the actor can provide the startling scares visitors are looking for. Creepy characters 'round every corner \nAuditions to be a part of Terror Behind the Walls begin in the summer. \nLong before the first leaf falls, approximately 500 hopeful haunters attend auditions with the dream of becoming a part of the Terror family. \nMany actors return year after year, but a large number are hired seasonally. \nThe audition process involves potential monsters screaming, acting out terrorizing scenarios, and personally explaining why they want to be a part of Terror Behind the Walls.

Actual hauntings \nAsk anyone involved with Terror Behind the Walls if they have ever had a strange experience at the prison, and the answer will most likely be \"yes.\" \nProfessional paranormal investigators from SyFy's \"Ghost Hunters,\" to Salem County-based Jersey Unique Minds Paranormal Society, have brought equipment into the prison to see if the claims of hauntings throughout the location can be proven. \nEvidence such as full-bodied apparitions, class A EVPs (electronic voice phenomenon), and reports of physical contact have been recorded within the walls. \nSo, when you ascend the staircase during Lock Down, and gaze upon the second level of cellblock 12, be sure to say hello. \nYou will be standing in the exact spot where the Ghost Hunters filmed an apparition running past the dark, abandoned cells. \nTerror Behind the Walls is open select days from now through Nov. 7. \nFor more information and for tickets, visit www.easternstate.org/halloween .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:42:29.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
