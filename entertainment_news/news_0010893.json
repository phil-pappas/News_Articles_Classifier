Castille played on the 2011 and 2012 University of Alabama national championship football teams as a walk-on cornerback. Alabama's is Nathan's alma mater. \nAnd Castille's father, All-American Jeremiah Castille, played on legendary coach Bear Bryant's final Alabama team in the 1980s. \nThe role, though, originally wasn't Castille's part. An actor from Great Britain was cast, but because of work Visa problems couldn't get into the country. Castille was a stunt double on the film. \nDownes and the rest of the creative team turned to Castille after the film's stunt coordinator raved about the young athlete turned actor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:27:41.264+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
