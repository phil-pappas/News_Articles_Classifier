Their concert begins 7:30 p.m. at the downtown venue, 345 Main St. \nConsidered one of the most dynamic young voices in music today, Bowersox is known for her sincerity and authenticity, which reflect her personal mission to live life and perform her rich amalgam of blues, country, folk and rock music to the fullest. Bowersox has performed alongside a wide spectrum of musicians, from Harry Connick Jr., Joe Cocker and Alanis Morrisette to Michael Franti, John Popper and BB King. She has recorded two albums; and played Patsy Cline in the 2014 Broadway production of “Always, Patsy Cline.” \nDespite his relatively young age, Massachusetts-based Glier is a seasoned troubadour. Averaging more than 250 live performances annually, he has shared the stage with artists as diverse as James Taylor, Ani DiFranco, Martin Sexton, Emmylou Harris and Ryan Adams; and has quickly become known for his passionate live sets. His sophomore record, “The Next Right Thing,” earned a Grammy nomination. On his latest album, this year’s \"If I Could Change One Thing,\" Glier embraces a genuine modern-pop direction. \nGlier is an advocate for Musicians On Call and a national spokesperson for ChildFund International who has helped more than 200 children find sponsors. He participated in the 2012 ROCK THE VOTE Road Trip, and took home Best Social Action Song for his track “The Next Right Thing” at the 11th Annual Independent Music Awards, his second IMA win. For his 2013 tour, he teamed up with Autism Speaks and raised more than $5,000 for the not-for-profit organization. \nGeneral admission tickets are $20 in advance and will be $25 day of show. The lobby and balcony bars are open for all live shows.
