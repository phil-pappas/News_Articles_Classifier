President & CEO’s comments Profitable Growth We are reporting record Q3 sales on the back of higher viewing levels, healthy customer intake and rising market shares, as well as the addition of a number of exciting new digital businesses. Profits were also up despite the substantial currency headwinds that we continue to face, and we delivered another quarter of profitable growth for the Group. Accelerating Transformation Our strategic transformation has now accelerated. We are implementing a large scale restructuring programme to bring our local operating businesses closer to the customer, and over time yield SEK 600 million of savings that we will mostly reinvest. We have made significant steps to resolve the position in Russia before the year-end deadline. CTC Media has signed a definitive agreement to sell 75% of its operations, and we are also working with our advisers on solutions for our Russian pay-TV channels business. We have then invested SEK 1.2 billion in three market leading digital businesses in high growth online video categories, and we have also invested to secure key sports rights and studio deals for years to come. This will enable us to develop our brands and products to deliver even more premium content across even more screens and platforms. Positive Momentum The performance of our Nordic businesses during this period of transition underlines the quality and popularity of our entertainment products, as our Scandinavian media houses delivered higher audience shares in each market for the first time in two years, and Viaplay continued to drive the growth in our subscriber bases. This has been complemented by very positive momentum in our CEE markets, and by the 42% organic growth in group-wide digital revenues. Sharpening Focus We will continue to execute on our transformation plan and review the portfolio, in order to ensure that we sharpen the focus on the products and businesses that offer the greatest potential for MTG. We are a more efficient and effective group today, and relevance and execution remain at the centre of all that we do.
