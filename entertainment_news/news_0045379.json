Photograph by: Liam Richards , Postmedia News \nCity and Colour’s fifth album is titled If I Should Go Before You and comes out on Friday, Oct. 9. At the ripe old age of 35, singer/songwriter Dallas Green is apparently sweating over the big stuff in new songs such as the soulful Lover Come Back to Me. \nOnly five years into his 2008 marriage to TV host Leah Miller, isn’t this a tad premature? \n“Love, life and death are three things that are a certainty, aren’t they?” says Green. \n“And I think that as long as I am singing and playing my guitar that is what I’ll have on my mind. This is what I’ve been doing for more than half my life and I don’t really know what else to do.” \nExploding out of St. Catharines, Ont. in 2001 with Juno award-winning rockers Alexisonfire, Green always had his solo project. \nThe first City and Colour recordings date back to 2000 and he is on record as saying the initial meat of some of the material was written in his teens. \nBut it wasn’t until the 2006 debut Sometimes that it got going full steam. Riding the success of the lead single Save Your Scissors, City and Colour established Green as a separate, and important, Canadian and global music artist. \nAt the time, City and Colour was Green and his guitar. Then it became a band. It continues today as a shifting entity. \n“One of the great parts of it is that all of the songs are still rooted in me and my guitar, so I can go from band to solo or back again,” he says. \n“When we finished up the last tour cycle for The Hurry and The Harm, before I went into the studio to start writing the new album, I went off and did a small tour of theatres with just me and my guitar performing to some of same audiences which had been at the band arena shows.” \nThere was also time between writing If I Should Go Before You to form the duo You + Me with American pop singer P!nk (Alecia Moore) and put out last October’s Rose Ave. The laid-back folkie album entered the Canadian chart at No. 1 and number four on the Billboard 200. It’s a far cry from the duo’s self-titled debut single to the nearly 10 minute-long atmospheric guitar squall of Woman, which opens If I Should Go Before You. \nGreen says his model for the shifting personality of his art is the iconic Neil Young. \n“The way that he follows whatever is moving him at that time, be it an acoustic album, on the road with Crazy Horse or this new one with Willie Nelson’s kids backing him,” says Green. \n“City and Colour can do Coachella, then the Saskatoon Jazz Festival and head to Australia and break up shows between band and solo. This is always how I wanted it and I’m so thankful and blessed that people are so accepting of it.” \nGreen actually appears on a bill with Young + Promise of the Real in Vancouver this week on the Rebel Content tour raising money for the David Suzuki Blue Dot Campaign for Environmental Rights in Canada (bluedot.ca). It’s a bucket-list check for the musician. \n“It’s funny because a couple of years ago at the Junos they did a 40th anniversary of the Toronto singer/songwriter scene and I did Old Man in front of Neil, which was weird, super scary and I didn’t get to meet him,” he says. \n“Then in 2012, he and Crazy Horse were supposed to play the Ottawa Folk Festival and they had to cancel and we were asked to fill in for him. So this will be the first time I’ve ever shared a bill with him and get to meet him, so obviously I’m very, very excited.” \nFans will be excited to hear the new material for the first time when City and Colour heads out across the U.S. starting with a Detroit show on Nov. 5 and then over to Europe. Green is chuffed that fellow Canucks Bahamas will be on some of the bill through the U.S. \n“It’s always good to tour with fellow Canadians,” he says. “Afie (Jurvanen) (a.k.a. Bahamas) actually toured with me as my guitarist to Australia back on the Little Hell tour when my guitarist Dan Romano, who has a terrible fear flying, couldn’t come. Bahamas would just do the opening slot and then join us.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T02:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:47:37.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
