All three parties, who had taken contrasting stances on the Bhagalpur riot incidents in which thousands of Muslims were killed, have now joined forces for collective self-interest, Hussain, the BJP national spokesperson, said. On Chief Minister Nitish Kumar trying to put the NDA government at the Centre on mat on socio-economic and political issues, he questioned Kumar’s national vision claiming that he did not have any business to do so as he was not even a full-fledged leader of Bihar itself.

With the caste and beef issues emerging as major poll planks in Bihar, the senior BJP leader charged Prasad and Kumar with fomenting communal strife in the state to reap electoral dividends “which was in stark contrast with the BJP-led coalition’s sole thrust on development to win the elections.” \nModified Date: October 19, 2015 1:31 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T23:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T23:50:04.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
