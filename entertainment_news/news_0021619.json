From there she’s off to Dallas Children’s Theater to catch a 4:30 p.m. performance of Fancy Nancy: The Musical.\nA longtime writer, she says it took her by surprise when Fancy Nancy became a sensation, with more than 60 books in various formats, from picture to chapter books, selling more than 28 million copies for Harper Collins in the U.S.\n“People sometimes will say to me, ‘Did you know you were going to write a best-selling kids’ book?’ and I think to myself, if I’d known, I would have done it 30 years earlier.”\nLike Nancy, O’Connor loved to dress up and perform for company when she was little. O’Connor had a younger sister, Jill, who became the inspiration for Nancy’s little sister, Jo Jo. Jill, O’Connor notes proudly, grew up to become Jill Abramson, the first female executive editor of The New York Times . Abramson is now lecturing at Harvard University and collaborating with her sister on a new children’s book.\nO’Connor credits her editor at Harper Collins, Margaret Anastas, for seeing the potential of Fancy Nancy before she did. It was Anastas who insisted it be illustrated by Robin Preiss Glasser, who gave Nancy her signature frilly look.\nThe key to Nancy is that she’s exuberant and gets excited and carried away, but when things don’t go as planned she’s resilient and learns what’s important, O’Connor says. In Fancy Nancy: The Musical at DCT, adapted from her book Fancy Nancy and the Mermaid Ballet , Nancy doesn’t get the starring role she wants, but finds she can still have a thrilling time in the ensemble.\nO’Connor is the mother of two boys, now grown. Part of the fun is to find herself surrounded by exuberant young girls decked out in tiaras and tutus.\n“It’s like dessert. I may have to put on a few boas and purple suede high heels.”\nPlan your life\n10:30 a.m. Saturday: Fancy Nancy party at Bookmarks. Paper Source will present paper-doll crafts and there’ll be tiaras, feather boas, top hats and bow ties for kids to play dress-up; 11 a.m.: sneak peek of Dallas Children’s Theater’s Fancy Nancy musical; 11:30 a.m.: Jane O’Connor will read books and answer questions.
