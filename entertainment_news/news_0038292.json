Participants gave glowing reviews of their experiences within the Power Circles demo during the event.\nThe Power Circle program offers a unique group process emphasizing facilitated peer-mentoring as a more efficient and empowering method of leadership development, as opposed to the top-down mentoring that most leadership programs employ today. Chantal Pierrat, founder and CEO of Emerging Women, knows from experience that the network of support created through Power Circles is not only more accessible, but also more likely to produce real results.\nWhat are the biggest benefits of Power Circles? They encourage intimate and authentic communication. They leverage collective experience versus 1:1 mentoring. They encourage the promotion of success and development not only in self but also in others. And because the program transcends industry and generation, it brings a rich, diverse experience to each Power Circle member.\nTwo-year Power Circle participant Susie Murdoch shared her experience:\nJoining Emerging Women's NYC Power Circle was the best decision I made in 2014! As a small business owner of a successful event planning company, I am required to lead and make decisions all day long. My hope was to find a diverse group of women that could act as a sounding board for my ideas and thoughts. What I found was so much more. These women have become my sisters. They don't need to get into my day to day (like family and friends do), they hold space for me, accept me and support me as a person overall. We do that for each other and our visions have been amplified, our frustrations have been protected and our successes have been celebrated.\nPower Circle participants are hand-selected for their respective groups through a match-making process which ensures that each group has the greatest potential alchemy. Trained facilitators make it easy for women to share their experiences and develop themselves as leaders pursuing careers fueled with purpose and impact.\nIn-person Power Circle groups are available in San Francisco, Denver, Boulder and New York City. These women will meet monthly for six months. Virtual Power Circles are perfect for women who need more flexibility in their schedules and see the benefit in connecting with a regionally diverse group. Virtual circles meet every three weeks for a four month span via video conferencing.\nEmerging Women recently announced that Power Circles will be available to corporations for company-specific circles in January 2016.
