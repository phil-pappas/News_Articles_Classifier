Ballet San Antonio names interim director 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Steven Bull , a former general manager with Ethan Allen, has been named interim executive director of Ballet San Antonio .\nBull, 58, succeeds Courtney Mauro Barker , who resigned in August alongside Artistic Director Gabriel Zertuche . Bull said he is hoping to win the position permanently.\n“When I left Ethan Allen, I had really thought what I want to do is get involved with nonprofit, so this hits all the food groups for me,” Bull said. “It involves the arts, it’s nonprofit, and it uses my years and years of management and business experience, as well.”\nBull has appeared in a number of local theater productions over the years, experience he expects will serve him well in his new post.\n“With all my performing background, I understand sets, lighting, costumes and that sort of thing, as well,” he said.\nJohnette Lee brought Bull to the attention of her fellow ballet board members. She went through Leadership San Antonio with his wife and got to know him through her.\n“I knew that he had had a key role with The Playhouse (-San Antonio), which is really successful, and they’re doing fantastic things,” Lee said. “When we had the turnover, I thought, ‘That’s a perfect fit.’ He has theater in his background, he’s a native San Antonian and he has good business experience, so I think he’s the perfect person to take us to the next level.”\nLee said the board has a few contenders for the artistic director position.\nBen Stevenson , a noted choreographer perhaps best known for his 27-year stint as artistic director with Houston Ballet , is serving in that position on an interim basis. He is working with the company for its season opener, “Swan Lake,” and on its annual staging of “The Nutcracker.”\n“Swan Lake” will be danced Oct. 9 to 11 at the Tobin Center for the Performing Arts .\ndlmartin@express-news.net", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/10/8725045/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/10/8725045/3/920x920.jpg", "http://balletsanantonio.org/"], "published": "2015-10-02T02:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T03:24:28.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
