The \" Jimmy Kimmel Live! \" host and his sidekick, Guillermo, got a dance lesson from Misty Copeland, the first African-American female principal dancer with the American Ballet Theater. \"She reminds me a great deal of myself,\" Kimmel said of the ballerina. As the comedian and his pal were seen getting out of a cab in pink tutus, he added, \"It took 47 years and a hell of a lot of soul searching, but today I finally discovered my passion is ballet.\" After practicing some basic positions, Copeland admitted she was \"extremely nervous\" about their performance. \"My hope is that they don't fall and hurt themselves,\" she said. As their session came to an end, she added, \"Ballet was born in Italy more than 600 years ago, and today it died.\" Jimmy Kimmel tapes his show in Brooklyn this week. Bill Murray was one of his first guests. He is also expected to interview Jay-Z ahead of Tidal's upcoming mega concert that will feature the likes of Beyonce Knowles , Usher , Nicki Minaj , Lil Wayne , and T.I. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T16:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:50:44.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
