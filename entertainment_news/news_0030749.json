He notes the donation to the women's health care provider is on behalf of him and his wife, illustrator Lisa Brown. He says they've been very fortunate and \"good fortune should be shared with noble causes.\" \nHouse Republicans in Washington have been trying to cut off federal funding for Planned Parenthood. They cite its practice of supplying tissue from aborted fetuses for scientific research. \nPlanned Parenthood defends the practice as the legal donation of tissue to research firms. It says the not-for-profit tissue donation programs support lifesaving scientific research. \nHandler's Lemony Snicket novels, \"A Series of Unfortunate Events,\" have sold millions of copies. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T04:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T23:41:04.411+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
