Marlon James is the first Jamaican to win literary prize in its 47-year history (Frank Augstein/AP) \nThe judges unanimously picked the book as the winner after “more than one but less than two hours of deliberation,” according to Michael Wood, chairman of the judging panel. \nThe book is loaded with Jamaican patois, bad language and a testing subject matter but Wood, urged people to read it – even though he might not give it to his own mother to read. \nHe said: “I think there is a kind of excitement right from the beginning. I think (James) has thought I am not trying to rub people’s noses in difficult terms, I am trying to get them to think about things that are actually out there. Promoted stories \n“I am going to give them ways in and I am going to give them voices they can listen to. A lot of it is very, very funny and a lot of it is very human. \n“It is not an easy read. It is a big book. There is some tough stuff and there is a lot of swearing but it is not a difficult book to approach. It is not a difficult book to get into.” The book contains one entire chapter written in Jamaican patois (Four Colman Getty/PA) \nThe New York Times described the book as “like a Tarantino remake of ‘The Harder They Come’ but with a soundtrack by Bob Marley and a script by Oliver Stone and William Faulkner…epic in every sense of that word”. \nWood said the book was about social conditions. \nHe joked that his mother probably would not have got past “the first few pages on the basis of the swearing”. \nJames was born in Kingston, Jamaica, but currently lives in Minneapolis, and this is his third novel. Bob Marley is referred to as “The Singer” throughout the book (AP) \nJames was presented with a trophy by the Duchess of Cornwall at a glittering ceremony at the Guildhall in central London. \nHe also received the £50,000 cheque gets a designer bound edition of his book and a further £2,500 for being shortlisted. The judges started off with 156 books before whittling it down to a shortlist of six finalists. \nHanya Yanagihara’s A Little Life, who had been the bookmakers’ hot favourite, had made the final cut along with fellow American Anne Tyler for A Spool Of Blue Thread. \nSunjeev Sahota’s The Year Of The Runaways was also a finalist along with British compatriot Tom McCarthy for Satin Island and Nigeria’s Chigozie Obioma for The Fishermen. Hanya Yanagihara had been favourite to win (Frank Augstein/AP) \nThis is the second year the prize has been open to writers of any nationality writing in English and published in the UK having previously been restricted to the UK and Commonwealth, Ireland and Zimbabwe.
