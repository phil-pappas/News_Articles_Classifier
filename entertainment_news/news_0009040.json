V K Singh for his comments on deaths of two minor Dalit children which took place after their house was set on fire by upper caste two Rajput men in Sunpedh village in Faridabad a couple of days back. Singh had compared the killing with pelting stones on dog and said that the government should not be held responsible for these incidents. \nSparking controversy into the incident, V K Singh had said, “This incident has nothing to with the Central government. This is the failure of state government. If someone throws stones at a dog, the government is not responsible.” Soon after his statement went viral, the opposition had slammed him with a demand to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi to sack its minister and initiate an action under the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. Even the Aam Aadmi Party leader Saurabh Bhardwaj had registered a complaint in the Oshiwara police station in Delhi.

But, its looks mere apologising would not satisfy the opposing Congress who have their resignation from the ministerial post. Seeking the government to take tough action against V K Singh, Congress spokesperson RS Surjewala has said, “The anti-Dalit, anti-poor face of the Narendra Modi governement today has been exposed completely. We demand a case must be registered against VK Singh under Prevention of Atrocities on SC Act Section 3 & 4. We demand that if PM Modi does not support VK Singh’s statement, he must be immediately sacked.” \nWith the Congress protest in Delhi, the Communist Party of India too criticised the statement of the leader and the members of the party launched an agitation in Kolkata near airport on Sunday and was shown black flag.
