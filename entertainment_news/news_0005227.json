Local craft brewers competed as part of the Oktoberfest-like celebration. \nLesley Moran and several friends supported her husband's beer, sporting his Thirty 2 Ten logo on their shirts. \n\"I'm here to support everyone and enjoy the craft of homebrewing,\" Lesley said. \nDr. Edan Moran, of Alexandria, has been brewing about five years, his wife said. \n\"It was the first time there was (a craft brew contest) in this area, and he was excited to try it out,\" she said. \nMoran served his \"Red My Mind Ale\" from a tent he shared with another competitor, Justin Bailey of Pineville. Funktoberfest organizers brewing up a good time \nThe festival attracted 10 home brewers from as far as Texas and sold more than 500 tickets, said Spirits owner Lee Gwinn. The public \"voted with their dollars\" in the brewing contest for the “People’s Choice” award. All the “votes” will benefit the local Tipitina’s Foundation Instruments A Comin’ program, which donates instruments to local schools. The brewers also judged each other for the “Top Brewer” award. \nMoran won People's Choice, and Jim Cox of Lafayette won Brewer's Choice, Gwinn said.

Jonathan Knoll, owner of Broken Wheel Brewery in Marksville, said it was a no-brainer to help sponsor the event and join the festivities. \n\"We're the first craft brewery in Central Louisiana. This is the first craft brew festival in Central Louisiana. It was a natural fit,\" Knoll said. \nMost attendants kept to the tents, but were not afraid to step out for more beer. \n\"So far it's been awesome,\" Marcus Brown, of Alexandria, said. \"I'm trying as much as I can. ... You've still got to get wet to get beer.\" \nWas it worth the short walk in the rain? \n\"I think so,\" he said. \nBrown was excited to have something new to do in town, especially on a weekend when he has a babysitter. \n\"It's nice to not have to drive down the highway,\" he said. \nOthers gave up on the tents and embraced the rain, getting close to the stage to sway to the music in their ponchos. \nNet proceeds from Funktoberfest — after the musical acts and other expenses are paid — will benefit Tipitina’s. 5 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.thetowntalk.com/story/news/2015/10/24/funktoberfest-crowd-braves-rain-beer/74229562/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T13:53:48.086+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
