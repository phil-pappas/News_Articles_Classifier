FWC via Wesh By Saturday evening, officials with the Florida Wildlife Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission reported 207 bears were killed in Florida on the first day of bear hunting . According to Wesh.com, there will be no more hunting in two bear management units in the state - Central and the East Panhandle - because the objectives have been met there; 100 and 40 bears, respectively.\nA 320 bear kill limit has been set up by the state. Susan Smith, the spokesperson for the FWC stated: \"The harvest objective was set as the number we want to achieve to stabilize the growing populations. When we set them, we did so with allowable range, recognizing that the harvest may exceed the objective.\" This is the first bear hunt since 1992 and has caused statewide and national outrage including protests and lawsuits. Over 3,778 bear hunting permits have been issued; hunters are allowed to kill one bear each. On Sunday, bear hunting will continue in northern Florida where 12 bears were killed and in southern Florida where 15 bears were killed on Saturday. Hunters are required to check in within 12 hours of killing a bear at one of the agency's 33 check-in stations. There the bear's teeth are checked and their girths measured.\nHunters waited in tree stands and took aim as bears walked by in nearby woods. One hunter stated he killed a bear and eats whatever he hunts, stating there are plenty of bears in the state and many have become nuisances. According to the Orlando Sentinel , the first dead bear to arrive at Rock Springs was a female bear weighing 298 pounds who had been lactating. Although the FWC contended they timed the hunt so that baby bears would be at least eight months old, youngsters stay closely bonded to their mothers for the first year and a half. \"It's wrong,\" stated monitor Astevia Willett, 53, of Largo. \"It's death. Now there are one or two babies alone so she [the hunter] can have a trophy on her wall.\"\nFollow the National Pet Rescue Examiner on Facebook.", "external_links": ["http://www.wesh.com/news/local-hunters-gearing-up-for-florida-bear-hunt/36021020?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=wesh", "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/breaking-news/os-florida-bear-hunt-kill-2015-20151024-story.html", "https://www.facebook.com/NationalPetRescueExaminer"], "published": "2015-10-25T04:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:42:01.965+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
