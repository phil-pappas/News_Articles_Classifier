He paid two women to accompany him in a VIP suite. \nThe next day, he asked about a dozen women working there to sign confidentiality agreements barring them from speaking about him. \nHof said no one has ever asked for such an agreement and that no confidentiality policy exists for the customers. However, the women who work there do sign an agreement prohibiting them from speaking out about clients. \nOdom was found in critical condition on Oct. 13. He remains hospitalized in Las Vegas. \n___ \n7:14 a.m. \nLamar Odom's family says his condition is improving after the former NBA star was found unconscious at a Nevada brothel a week ago. \nAlvina Alston, publicist for Odom's aunt JaNean Mercer, said Monday that the former reality-TV personality is alert and undergoing testing, but there's no word yet on when he might be released from the hospital. \nMercer said in a statement that Odom is overcoming \"insurmountable obstacles\" and defying the odds. \nThe statement says, \"Each day Lamar is getting stronger and reaching significant milestones in his recovery.\" \nOdom was found in extremely critical condition at the Love Ranch brothel in Crystal, Nevada, on Oct. 13. The brothel said workers saw him drink alcohol and take supplements sold as \"herbal Viagra.\" \nHis family, including estranged wife Khloe Kardashian, rushed to Las Vegas to be by his side.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:44:27.221+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
