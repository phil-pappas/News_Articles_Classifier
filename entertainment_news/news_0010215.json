After a three-year hiatus, the British beauty returned to the game on Thursday night, October 22 with the single \"Hello\" which will lead her just-announced new album, \" 25 \". On the heartbreaking slow-tempo ballad, Adele emotionally sings about reaching out to a former lover whose heart she broke years ago. She's been trying to call him to explain her past actions, but it appears that he hasn't forgiven her yet. \"Hello from the other side/ I must've called a thousand times to tell you/ I'm sorry, for everything that I've done/ But when I call you never seem to be home,\" she sings. \"Hello from the outside/ At least I can say that I've tried to tell you/ I'm sorry, for breaking your heart/ But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore.\" The ballad is accompanied by an equally beautiful and dramatic music video directed by Xavier Dolan. In the sepia-toned clip, Adele is seen going back to a house filled with memories of her and her ex. \"25\", the singer's first album in four years, is scheduled for release on November 20. She has described the follow-up to the Grammy-winning \" 21 \" as \" a make-up record .\" In a tweet announcing the project earlier this week, she explained, \"I'm making up with myself. Making up for lost time. Making up for everything I ever did and never did.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T11:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:57:42.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
