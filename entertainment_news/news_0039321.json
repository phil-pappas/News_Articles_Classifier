Political consistency is not their virtue. There can be no other result but to push Bihar into anarchy in case they win.”Jaitley, the Union Finance Minister, said that while one could never comprehend an alliance between BJP and Congress, it was even more difficult to imagine the followers of Ram Manohar Lohia joining hands with Congress given their differing thoughts and ideologies.”We see such political inconsistency and such a contradictory alliance. A three-legged race cannot be run and even if it is run, it cannot be won,” he said. \nJaitley also attacked Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, saying that he had allied himself with the creators of ‘jungle raj’.Despite Kumar having won the last three polls in Bihar on the promise of freeing the state from ‘jungle raj’, Jaitley claimed that nothing would change under a coalition of which Lalu Prasad was a part.He also slammed Lalu Prasad for his attack on BJP over the reservation issue in the wake of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s call for a review of the quota policy. \n“RJD knows it cannot win on the issue of development and that is why it is trying to divide society over other issues,” alleged Jaitley. Talking about the ‘Vision Document’ for Bihar, he said it was for ushering in development in the state through the creation of roads and infrastructure, agro-based industry and employment opportunities. He also talked about Bihar’s rich human resources and agriculture to propel such progress.”The Centre will always stand behind Bihar to help it. If a BJP-led government is formed in Bihar, which we hope will happen, Bihar will rewrite its history,” he said. \n  3:54 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T13:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T13:51:10.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
