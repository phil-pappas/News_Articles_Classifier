You are stronger than you think x.\" \nEarlier this month, Luke posted a cryptic message on the site which read: \"Love is all you need ,when it's real.\" \nJessie and Luke's split comes as a surprise to many as just a few months ago the 'Bang Bang' hitmaker was talking about her desire to start a family. \nAsked what else she would like to do with her life, she said: \"Have a baby - not today! But that's something that I hope that I'm blessed with in my life.\" \nAnd Jessie had not been shy about sharing her feelings for Luke on social media. \nShe previously posted pictures of them together on Instagram and wrote: \"It's crazy how your priorities change as you get older and everything you watch in films that you never really understood start making complete sense. With age comes understanding. \n\"It's one of life's most exquisite feelings to find someone who loves you, like really loves you and accepts you and gets you!!! This man is a light in my life... @wolfjames is one of a kind.\" bang showbiz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:59:07.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
