He's won three Grammy Awards, 16 Academy of Country Music Awards, 14 Country Music Association Awards, 10 American Music Awards, three People's Choice Awards and numerous other honors. The two-time GRAMMY-nominated \"Meanwhile Back at Mama's\" marked Tim's 54th career Top Ten Hit off his latest album, SUNDOWN HEAVEN TOWN (Big Machine Records). The project also produced the #1 \"Shotgun Rider\" and current single \" Diamond Rings and Old Barstools\" featuring Tim's cousin, Catherine Dunn . His critically acclaimed acting skills were highlighted in the award winning films Friday Night Lights, The Blind Side and most recently in Disney's Tomorrowland .\nGovernor Larry Hogan\nGovernor Larry Hogan was elected as the 62 nd governor of Maryland in November of 2014. His race was called the biggest upset victory in the entire nation. Although he was outspent by $16 million - by more than 5-1 - in a state that was only 26% Republican, Hogan's grassroots campaign won by a landslide in 20 out of 23 counties of the state – carrying them by more than a 35 percentage point margin.\nGovernor Hogan became only the second Republican elected governor of Maryland , in nearly 50 years. He was the first resident of Anne Arundel County elected governor in more than a hundred years. And Hogan is the first governor in Maryland history ever elected using public financing and campaign spending limits. In his first legislative session as governor, Hogan provided record funding for education, pushed for tax relief for families, small businesses and retirees. He pushed reform for charter schools and negotiated one of the biggest environmental achievements for cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay in history.\nThe state budget under Hogan has the lowest rate of growth in spending in 40 years, and for the first time in a decade Maryland has tax cuts, instead of tax hikes. The Baltimore Sun recently named Governor Larry Hogan as \"Marylander of the Year.\"\nRay Lewis\nRay Lewis is widely considered to be one of the most dominant defensive players in the history of the NFL. Lewis led the Baltimore Ravens to victory in Super Bowl XXXV (where he was named Super Bowl MVP) and again in Super Bowl XLVII, in what would be the final game of his career. Two time NFL Defensive Player of the Year (2000 and 2003), he's played in 228 games including 11 playoff games. Today, Lewis devotes his time to being a father, businessman, community activist as well as an analyst for the NFL on ESPN.\nKool & the Gang\nKool & the Gang has sold over 70 million albums worldwide and influenced the music of three generations. Thanks to songs like \"Celebration,\" \"Cherish,\" \"Jungle Boogie,\" \"Summer Madness\" and \"Open Sesame,\" they've earned two Grammy Awards, seven American Music Awards, 25 Top Ten R&B hits, nine Top Ten Pop hits and 31 gold and platinum albums. Kool & the Gang has performed continuously for the past 43 years, longer than any R&B group in history. Their bulletproof funk and jazzy arrangements have also made them the most sampled band of all time.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151024/280224\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/country-superstar-tim-mcgraw-headlines-concert-to-benefit-university-of-maryland-childrens-hospital-300165764.html\n ", "external_links": ["https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151024/280224", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151024/280224", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC37331&Transmission_Id=201510242230PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC37331&DateId=20151024", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/country-superstar-tim-mcgraw-headlines-concert-to-benefit-university-of-maryland-childrens-hospital-300165764.html", "http://www.ummsfoundation.org/", "http://umm.edu/programs/childrens"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:17:31.921+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
