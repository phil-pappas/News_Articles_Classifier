Cleveland life had sailed along smoothly for 47 years. When it did hit a bump, it was quickly smoothed out. But then his wife died. He soon fell into a pit that had no bottom. Finally, when he thought he had hit bottom and a helping hand lifted him out, cleaned him up and gave him an even better life than he had before, that very helping hand began to turn on him. Over the span of a decade, his dreams were shattered again, and he was in even worse shape than when his first wife had died. He had lost everything, except his son, who is still his lifesaver. “From Happiness to Tragedy; To Bliss on the Borderline” (published by AuthorHouse) makes people aware, that life can change drastically in a matter of moments.\nIn “ From Happiness to Tragedy; To Bliss on the Borderline ,” the author wrote the book to look back on his life and determine what he could of and should have done better. He planned to discuss his life with his first wife and then that after her tragic death. But, in the midst of the book, his second wife left him, as suddenly as his first wife had died. After putting down his pen for a number of months, he then began to elaborate on the trauma of his second marriage. Through the years with her, the books he had read, and the findings of her psychologists , he was convinced she has Borderline Personality Disorder . The second parts of the book deal with his roller coaster ride with a beautiful, sex crazed, BPD woman.\nThroughout the book the author flashbacks to better days, the death of his wife, the adoption of his son, and basically how life was. Then he compares life to reality . It is a memoir that progresses from present to past and back to present again. Parts of this book, he wrote, as the events were unfolding. Parts, after they had already occurred. It is an honest portrait of a man who was struggling with a horrible present and comparing it to a wonderful past.\n“From Happiness to Tragedy; To Bliss on the Borderline”\nBy Nicholas E.
