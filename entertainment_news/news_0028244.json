C heers to County Manager Lee Smith for enforcing a policy to keep gun-toting elected officials out of the county courthouse. Let’s hope other officials who are responsible for public safety in public buildings, including City Hall, follow suit.\nLast Friday, Mr. Smith addressed a memo to “County Commissioners” and “All County Staff” in which he cited a new Georgia state law in increasing security at the Old Courthouse downtown, where the County Commission meets.\nThe memo is clearly a response to an incident at a political forum on Oct. 3 at the Ralph Mark Gilbert Civil Rights Museum on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, where Shaundra McKeithen, a candidate running for the 5th District of Savannah City Council, said her opponent’s husband, Chatham County Commissioner Yusuf Shabazz, flashed a handgun at her and gave her a “menacing” look and pulled his jacket aside to show the gun at his side when she was getting ready to leave the museum.\n“I really felt fearful,” said McKeithen, who filed a report with Metro police that night. Mr. Shabazz, a former spokesman for the radical New Black Panther Party, has not been charged with making a “terrorist threat,” nor has it been reported whether he has a permit to carry a handgun. Ms. McKeithen said the weapons appeared larger than a .22 and had a black handle. She is challenging Mr. Shabazz’s wife, Estella, in the race for the City Council, District 5 seat. Let’s hope Metro Chief Joseph Lumpkin’s investigators and Chatham County District Attorney Meg Heap get to the bottom of what happened on Oct. 3 before city voters go to the polls on Nov. 3. They deserve to know from their top local law enforcement officials whether certain public officials are above the law.\nAccording to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a national organization that keeps close tabs on hate groups, “The New Black Panther Party is a virulently racist and anti-Semitic organization whose leaders have encouraged violence against whites, Jews and law enforcement officers.”\nMr. Smith’s memo states that “effective immediately all persons entering the Old Courthouse located at 124 Bull Street will be subject to metal detector scanning and searching of handbags, backpacks, briefcases, etc. This measure has been put in place per Georgia state law.”\nIt specifically adds, “There are no exceptions to any of the public, County staff, or County Commissioners.”\nThat’s as it should be.\nPreviously, commissioners could breeze into and out of the courthouse without going through the metal detector. Given what allegedly happened on Oct. 3, Mr. Smith had no choice but to insist that firearms be kept out of courthouse. While Americans who aren’t convicted felons have a constitutional right to own and carry firearms, they have an obligation to do so legally and responsibly. Memos like the one the county manager wrote are necessary for those who think that society’s laws and norms of responsible behavior don’t apply to them, which includes arrogant elected officials like Mr. Shabazz, who has a reputation as a bully and a hot head and is an embarrassment to the County Commission and residents of the county’s 5th District. He was elected in 2012 to a four-year term and is up for re-election next year.\nSeparating someone like that from possibly bringing firearms in public places is a sensible and pro-active move, and Mr. Smith should be congratulated for putting the safety of citizens and county employees above the mammoth egos of elected officials, who shouldn’t be inconvenienced by the requirement to walk through a metal detector. Indeed, the Shabazz rule should be enforced in more public buildings he might enter.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-11T17:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:47:25.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
