Since there were no architects in evidence here until the early 1900s, the structures reflect the individual characteristics of the carpenters (charpentiers in French) and builders.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13025479.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.visitlakecharles.org/apps", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13025479.htm"], "published": "2015-10-16T00:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:49:18.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
