So why is he writing a 700-page adventure novel titled The Explorer's Guild ? \n\"You get a chance in life to take your cuts, to swing for the fences. And what are you gonna do? Are you gonna repeat your successes or are you going to just push on,\" he explained on Thursday's Good Morning America . \nThe Explorers Guild: Volume One: A Passage to Shambhala follows a mysterious group of travelers as they bravely travel around the world. \nSo why is it so long? \"It has heft. There is a girth to it,\" Costner explained. \"...You want it to make a big sound when it hits the table.\" \nCostner, a father of seven, said the the book would appeal to most of his children. Still, it may be too advanced for his son, Cayden, to read. \n\"At 8 years old, it would have to be read to Cayden. I think he's gotta be a dash older. But this is the kind of book where, you know, your grandfather could look at a 12-year-old and go, 'Let's read The Explorer's Guild tonight,'\" he said on GMA . \nThe Explorers Guild: Volume One: A Passage to Shambhala is out now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:34:25.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
