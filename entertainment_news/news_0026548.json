EDM creators and its admirers, take note. \nThis 17-track set, which has Jackson reuniting with longtime collaborators Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, is full of soulful, electro and addictive tracks that will make your head bop or vogue, or think. \nOn the downbeat and introspective \"Black Eagle,\" Jackson gets political, singing about those who are overlooked and judged. \n\"I'm singing this love song to show my support, to the beautiful people who have been ignored, with blind eyes and cold showers attacking them, invisible people they won't let fit in,\" she sings. \"Because every life matters — we all need to do better.\" \nJackson isn't always serious, and \"Unbreakable\" is a balanced adventure: \"Dammn Baby,\" which samples a line from her late '90s hit \"I Get Lonely,\" has a semi-trap sound that is a winner; Missy Elliott brings the heat on the fun \"BURNITUP!\"; and \"Night\" is a house and trance anthem. \nThe album's first single, \"No Sleeep,\" is a sexy R&B number and on \"2 B Loved,\" which features a classic Jackson hook, she's a confident independent woman in love. \n\"You see I'm not the kind of girl you got to babysit, no, no, if you have things to do, I understand,\" she sings, most likely about her beau. \nAnd while \"Unbreakable\" has some B-level tracks — including \"Take Me Away\" and \"Gon' B Alright\" — the album is a reminder that Jackson is one icon who hasn't lost a beat. That's the way real music goes. \nFollow Mesfin Fekadu on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MusicMesfin This CD cover image released by Rhythm Nation/BMG Rights Management shows \"Unbreakable,\" the latest released by Janet Jackson.
