The 280,000 square foot building now under construction will feature a public law library and civic outreach center. It will also house the ASU Alumni Law Group, the nation’s first not-for-profit, privately financed teaching law firm, which employs recent ASU Law graduates to represent everyday Arizonans.\n“Society, at all levels, has a need to work together to solve the many challenges facing our state and nation,” stated retired United States Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor. “I know that it is possible for people to sit down together and engage in cooperative problem solving. This is what I want the O'Connor Institute to stand for. We can do it. The possibilities are endless.”\n“To have the Sandra Day O’Connor Institute share this incredible space with the law school that bears her name, is an honor and an amazing opportunity for our community and our students,\" said ASU Law Dean Douglas Sylvester. “Students will benefit from understanding the institute’s mission and how their legal education can further Justice O’Connor’s tremendous legacy.”\nASU Law’s six-story structure, along with a two-story underground garage, will take up 75 percent of the block bordered by Taylor Street on the north, First Street on the west, Polk Street on the south, and Second Street on the east. The address for the new building will be 111 Taylor Street, Phoenix, Arizona.\n“We are delighted and honored for this collaborative opportunity with Arizona State University,” noted O’Connor Institute Chairman of the Board Peter Hayes. “This location is ideal to continue the lifelong work of Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, including constructive dialogue and civic action.”\n“Our new home at the Arizona Center for Law and Society at ASU represents an exciting new era for the Sandra Day O’Connor Institute,” noted O’Connor Institute President and CEO Sarah Suggs. “It will allow the O’Connor Institute to vastly increase our programming in support of our mission.”\nAbout Sandra Day O’Connor Institute\nThe Sandra Day O’Connor Institute continues the legacy and lifetime work of Sandra Day O’Connor to advance civil discussion and civic action.
