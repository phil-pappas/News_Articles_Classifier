After four miscarriages and a stillborn baby ​ the couple had given up trying to have a child and, as Arkell's reaction in the video shows, were totally stunned to find out they had another chance.\nBut on Tuesday, the couple who touched everyone's hearts, found themselves in the middle of a medical crisis. Dana went into labor 16 weeks early, landing her in critical care and leaving their young son clinging to life.\n More From Cosmopolitan \"Her body has endured all it can take,\" her family wrote on the couple's Facebook page . A day later, Dana herself posted a ​heartrending ​ message about the health of their infant son, who the couple named ​ Kaleb Arkell Graves.\n\"He is tiny in statue but he is a fighter,\" Dana said in her first post in more than two weeks. \"He is in stable but critical condition.\"\nShe said when she arrived in the intensive care unit, doctors said in order to save her life she would have to terminate the pregnancy. But Dana refused. \"He was my miracle an I had to give him a fighting chance to make it,\" she said. \"Daily I was told how my chances of survival were declining because of my heart functions and chronic blood pressure.\"\nDana said Kaleb only had a five percent chance of survival, but he was born. Now the couple waits for more good news. Kaleb is expected to remain in the hospital for several more months.\n\" ​He's very small but he's strong,\" Arkell ​ told WRIC . ​\"[Dana] fought through this. She didn't have to do this, so my respect for her is, oh man, I don't even think Webster has a word for it.\" ​\n​Follow Rebecca on Instagram .", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/rebeccaburtrose/", "https://www.facebook.com/DanaArkell/posts/1624546827806369", "https://www.facebook.com/DanaArkell?fref=photo", "http://wric.com/2015/10/21/dinwiddie-dad-behind-viral-baby-announcement-says-baby-buns-is-small-but-strong/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9nviJhPZTA"], "published": "2015-10-22T07:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:06:50.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
