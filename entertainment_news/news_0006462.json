Actor Vincent Price later bought it and donated it to the Honolulu Museum of Art in 1981. \nMuseum officials returned the cedar pole to seven Tlingit (KLINK'-it) tribal members who traveled from southeast Alaska for a ceremony Thursday. \nThey sang songs and thanked Hawaii for taking good care of the pole, which was packed in a crate to be shipped to Alaska. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press.
