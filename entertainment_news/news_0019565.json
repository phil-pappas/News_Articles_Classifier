What did I think? Here’s everything you need to know about Galloway Grill, in five easy-to-follow steps. Happy eating, friends. \nThree Words: beer-battered fries. That’s really all you need to know about Galloway Grill. Angela says they’re the most amazing thing she’s ever tasted. “I love the crispiness of them; the seasoning is amazing.” Yes, all of that. Before I visited Galloway Grill with Angela, I’d visited several times with co-workers at lunchtime. I don’t care who I was with, everyone loved those fries. Even if a colleague ordered a salad, she still snuck fries from someone else’s plate. It was as if a trip to Galloway Grill also meant that these fries must be consumed. Owners Ann and Dan Carter know they’ve hit gold with those fries, too. “It’s that secret seasoning we put on there,” Ann says. “We knew immediately we were going to serve those, and they’ve been a staple for us.” Secret or not, I just want them in my belly. I’m not ashamed to say that I’ll eat the whole plate if given the chance. \nCome as you are. For real. Promise. “We really strive for friendly service in a casual atmosphere,” Ann says. Its proximity to the Sequiota Greenways Trail makes it the perfect stop for runners, hikers or even a family out for a weekend walk. “I really enjoy coming for lunch,” Angela says. “The backdrop is so pretty.” Runners, dogs — all pass by while we eat, and every once in a while we see a runner or walker stop in for lunch. “Whether you’ve been working out on the trail or finishing up at a wedding, all types are welcome here,” Ann says.

Stidham/For the News-Leader) \nGrill or Station? Know the difference. Don’t be that guy. The Carters purchased Galloway Grill as a vacant building, but let’s not ignore the elephant in the room: the building used to house Galloway Station, a longtime favorite on Lone Pine. That crew moved over to East Republic Road and pretty much has its same folks and menu. Both are great, but know where you’re going. I enjoy both, and at lunchtime, when someone mentions Galloway, there’s always this minute or two to make sure everyone understands whether we’re meeting at Grill or Station. Make sure you know the difference. Don’t be the guy sitting on East Republic with a stuffed mushroom in your hand while your friends are on their second order of beer-battered fries. Galloway Station is perfect for gyros, burgers, onion rings and stuffed mushrooms. Galloway Grill hits the spot with those on-point fries, great sandwiches — I had the Three Way, which has three, count them, three types of pork on it — and tasty salads. Both have amazing ranch. Ann says the Grill makes its own ranch in house. “You can taste the difference,” she says. Now that you know about the two Galloways, there’s no excuse to get lost again, wallowing in a corner while your co-workers live it up at the other Galloway, sharing the gossip of the current office romance between Tina and Gary. You’re so lost that you’re probably thinking about asking Tina out for happy hour after work today. Gary is going to be mad at you. Stop that. Know the difference. \nDrinks, drinks, drinks. Yep, sitting outside in the fall with a beer in hand from Galloway Grill’s bar is probably the best way to spend an afternoon or late night. Worried about the cold? Don’t worry. Ann is awesome, and she’ll turn the patio heaters on for you. Outside is the best side. In addition, if you’re not into beer or it’s still the middle of the workday for you and your boss is watching, Galloway Grill has one of my favorites: Fresca. Zero calories. Plus you can take the plastic cup home after. I’m slowly collecting a cupboard full of Galloway Grill, Big Whiskey’s and Mother’s Brewing Company cups. My kids love them. “Mom, I want the Big Whiskey’s cup with my mac and cheese!” Done, son! \nSandwiches you don’t want to stop eating. Angela chose the Red Bird, which has spicy chicken grilled and dipped in wing sauce, covered in Swiss cheese. Angela gets hers without a bun, so that she can guilt-freely indulge in the beer-battered fries. “This chicken is so tender,” she says. And like any smart lady would do, she dips her chicken in Galloway Grill’s made-in-house ranch. “Their ranch dressing is ridiculous here,” she says. “I’ve tried to reproduce it at home but failed.” My three-way sandwich has sliced ham, pulled pork and bacon. Three ways of pork, and I’m diggin’ it. “It’s a hit,” Ann says. She also says that while her sandwiches are great, she’s a huge fan of the Grill’s salmon. “You can have it as an entree, a sandwich or on a salad,” Ann says. \nThat’s it, Galloway Grill in a nicely packaged nutshell. Keep eating and keep telling me where the best eats in Springfield are. The best secrets are the ones we share with everyone. When it comes to food, that is. \nAngela Kuehn", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:32:11.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
