'Do you have any dieting tips for other teenage boys?'\" \nFor the young actress, being asked about her dieting habits is not only rude, but absolutely absurd. \"I mean, come on. I don't diet! I'm thirteen! Nobody my age should be dieting or trying to change themselves because society says so. And seriously, I'm thirteen!\" \nBlanchard then continued with some of the best dieting advice ever given: \"The only 'dieting tip' I have is, like, if you don't order fries, you'll probably be mad.\" Huffington Post/Getty \nBlanchard, an ambassador for the #TeamHeForShe feminism campaign, says that she's fine with answering questions about who she's \"wearing\" on the red carpet, but that shouldn't be the focus. \n\"It's cool to spotlight a new designer on the runway, and to contribute to the fashion world that I love,\" Blanchard added, \"But don't make my story, and who I am, be my dress, while my male co-star's story is how he picks scripts and gets inspired.\" \nBlanchard has been extremely vocal about feminism and gender equality over the last year. In June, she gave a speech calling out the wage gap for #TeamHeForShe and in August she wrote a blog post on the importance of intersectional feminism . If Blanchard is this amazing at just 13 years old, there's no telling how much of a badass she's going to be in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T21:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T22:28:46.923+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
