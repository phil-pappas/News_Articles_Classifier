It then moves through to the evolution of various ocean-dwelling beasts right up to the kinds of things we could expect to see in the deepest depths even now, an area of our world even less explored than the space beyond it.\nTo do this the Prehistoric Aquarium deploys a screen that acts as a kind of tank, the animals coming to life on it and behind it, some as shadow puppets, some as projections others as full-sized puppets. Later light and fibre-optic cable is used beautifully to illustrate the kind of bioluminescence that occurs in the depths.\nAs with many Erth shows, younger viewers are invited to sit on the floor right in front of the action, with a small group of older kids taking part in the show as “interns”, appropriately dressed in suits reminiscent of old-timey diving gear.\nInevitably, disaster strikes and the aquarium bursts open, the larger animals swimming around and above the audience.\nWhile it’s not as immediately dramatic as the dinosaur or indigenous mythology shows, there is a hypnotic, meditative quality to the piece. And it pushes Erth’s concern with audience participation and immersion a little bit further, the “interns” taking part in a fuller kind of way, acting as proxies for the rest of us.\nAnd there is so much in it that is so deftly deployed there’s no sense of being in a class.\nErth’s Prehistoric Aquarium is a great value school holiday experience, ideal for the five and over set and a great addition to the company’s repertoire.\nErth’s Prehistoric Aquarium, Carriageworks, 245 Wilson St, Eveleigh; 10am and noon, until October 4, $25, erth.com.au", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/cd755904259f219f9f03f37588e3a7d1", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/4586b5d31da28a13c8f0d5d0d0e8ed18", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0b3b0504f7b896aafbc583f2c7d80217", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a32238c55f0819e988ff6f0fe0631e89", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f6f4e67ce499794be0262f7638a62bb1", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9f612afd371a92f7f0889222cfeec35b"], "published": "2015-10-01T15:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T22:44:49.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
