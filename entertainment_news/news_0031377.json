I wouldn't say it's a surprise if Addison (Russell) goes deep Friday or someone goes deep that (usually) doesn't, because it has been going on all year that someone steps up and helps carry the load.\"\nThis marks the first playoff start for Jon Lester as a Cub, and he laughed when he discovered he will be facing Lackey, a teammate and friend from their days with the Red Sox.\n\"That's my boy,\" Lackey said.\nSaid Lester: \"It's not too often you get to be in a situation like this to go against one of your better friends. But, come (Friday), we're not buddies anymore.\"\nCubs catcher David Ross also played with Lackey and Lester on the Red Sox and called them \"big rednecks, and I love them both.\"\nLackey (13-10), 36, is expected to attract mild interest this winter from the Cubs, who are in the market to add impact pitching.\n\"Aces are special, but they don't grow on trees,\" Ross said. \"But there are number of things that make up an ace, and personality is one of them.\"\nLackey has the distinction of pitching World Series-clinching games for the Angels (2002) and the Red Sox (2013).\nLester is 6-4 in 14 postseason starts with a 2.57 ERA, and is 2-0 in the World Series. Lackey is 7-5 in 21 playoff appearances with a 3.08 ERA, including a 2-1 record in the World Series.\n\"Experience wires guys,\" Ross said. \"You get wired, your personality comes out with the more experience you have. I don't think Jon Lester is the same guy on the mound that he was as a rookie or three years in. You mature and learn from your experiences and you grow as players.\n\"Our team is a huge example of that. This team is not the same team that we broke camp with and was playing in May. It's a totally different team and a mature team with very experienced people.\"\nMaddon pointed to the Cubs' win-or-go-home triumph Wednesday night in Pittsburgh in the NL wild-card game as their latest step in their maturity and development.\n\"When you go through a moment like we did (in a 4-0 victory), we played Game 7 already,\" Maddon said. \"You go through that moment where you have to win to advance.\"\nRookie Kris Bryant doesn't anticipate the pressure of the NLDS equaling what he experienced Wednesday.\n\"This is my first taste of postseason baseball,\" Bryant said. \"I don't know what to expect, but I'm ready for anything.\"\nmgonzales@tribpub.com\nTwitter @MDGonzales\nPrivacy Policy Major League Baseball Chicago Cubs Jon Lester St. Louis Cardinals Boston Red Sox World Series Joe Maddon", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56170c09/turbine/ct-nl-playoffs-cubs-cardinals-spt-1009-20151008"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:06:06.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
