She believes that in past two years, he has changed from a boy to a man. The former model’s marriage to the 28-year-old was shaky when the latter admitted to cheating on Price with two of her best friends, but the 37-year-old insists he has “changed”, reports femalefirst.co.uk. “Other people think Kieran is a cheat and a liar, but I don’t care what they think. I’m the harshest judge and I know how much he has changed. In the past two years, he’s gone from a boy to a man. I trust him 100 percent,” Fabulous magazine quoted Price as saying. Sharing that her husband’s life now revolves only around her children and herself, Price said: “He’s not vain, he hardly looks at himself in the mirror. He’s even got a little pot belly, which I actually like a lot. His whole life revolves around me and the kids. We never row, we have a laugh, and he’s the one man who makes me totally happy.” Related Posts", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T05:41:44.466+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
