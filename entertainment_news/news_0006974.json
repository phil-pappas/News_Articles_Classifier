World War II era music and Danbury Fair memories and tunes to be presented at Richter House   \nRichter Association for the Arts will soon present the final events of its fall season. “The Songs of World War II” takes place on Sunday, Oct. 18, while entertainer Billy Michael ’s performance of “A Day at the Danbury Fair” will be Sunday, Oct. 25. \nBoth programs start at 3 p.m. at Richter House , at 100 Aunt Hack Road in Danbury. Admission is by free-will donation. \nThe Oct. 18 concert is a tribute to the composers and performers of the tunes that helped Americans keep up their morale at home and on the battlefront during World War II. It features soprano Joanne Kant and mezzo soprano Wanda Grochowski , accompanied by pianist Justine Macurdy . \nKant, a member of the first class of women at Yale University , performed in college musicals, sang in the Chapel Choir and toured Europe as a soloist with the Yale Glee Club . Some roles she’s done that were favorites include Lucia in “Lucia de Lammermoor,” Mimi in “La Boheme,” and Marguerite in “Faust.” She has also enjoyed performing Broadway tunes in concert. \nGrochowski, a frequent recitalist in the Westchester area, has sung the roles of Carmen, Amneris in “Aida,” and Suzuki in “Madama Butterfly,” among many others. She has also performed songs from Broadway and movie musicals. \nMacurdy holds bachelor’s and master’s degrees in music from the University of Michigan , and has been associated with the New England Conservatory of Music and the opera department of Tanglewood in Massachusetts. She has played rehearsals for conductors Eugene Ormandy , Leopold Stokowski and Julius Rudel , among others, and currently plays piano for the vocal group Musica Plenti and many area singers. \n“A Day at the Danbury Fair” features local historian Michael in a retrospective of the 113 years of the fair. A longtime supporter of the arts, Michael is a musician who has been called the “ultimate entertainer.” He was closely associated with the famous fair for many of its later years, and has a wealth of songs and stories to prove it. Whether you have firsthand recollections of the fair or just know it by reputation, you’ll find this program to be a lively, audience-involved afternoon of happy memories. \nRefreshments and conversation follow the two Sunday events. Parking is available in Richter’s golf course lot, with handicap parking in front of the venue. The performances are partially funded by the Danbury Cultural Commission .
