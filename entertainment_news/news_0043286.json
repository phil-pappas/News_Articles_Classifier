Ian Hislop and Camilla Long (Richard Kendal/Hat Trick/BBC) \nWhen Osman asked Clarkson if he regretted punching Mr Tymon, Hislop said he “wasn’t all bad” as he had also once allegedly punched the former Daily Mirror editor Piers Morgan. \nAnd there were jokes poking fun at Clarkson’s relationship with his new employer, Amazon, for whom he and his former Top Gear colleagues James May and Richard Hammond are making a new car show. \nDuring a sound problem during filming, Osman told him: “This wouldn’t happen on Amazon Prime. Are you sure it’s Amazon Prime and not Amazon past-their-prime?” Paul Merton and Richard Osman (Richard Kendal/Hat Trick/BBC) \nBut Clarkson was happy to make jokes at his own expense, the Radio Times said, once insisting he was forbidden to discuss motoring matters. \nHe said: “I can’t talk about cars on the BBC. I can’t say the C-word.” \nClarkson was suspended by the broadcaster on March 10 after punching Mr Tymon during a row over a steak dinner, before the BBC announced his contract would not be renewed. Share article \nThe new series of Have I Got News For You begins on October 2 at 9pm on BBC One.
