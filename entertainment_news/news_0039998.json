New moons are always a time for beginnings and important decisions, but this one — presaging fall frolics — packs a special wallop.\nAries (March 20-April 18) No, Ari! No, that person does not “just want to be friends.” You Rams are nothing if not impulsive. Now, with the sun and new moon lap dancing in your one-on-one house, be certain to say what you mean and mean what you say.\nTaurus (April 19-May 19) Monday’s sun/moon meld impacts the nitty-gritty of your life. Cosmic biggies have you in their cross-hairs. What’s on the line? “Just” those daily components that make things work or not work. \nGemini (May 20-June 20) The sun shines, the moon waxes, each setting off your sensuality sensor. You want to romp, form amorous attachments or make existing ones livelier. Easy does it; this is a time when babies can get started. \nCancer (June 21-July 21) This year’s theme continues to embrace both workaday issues and lofty ambitions. Family issues factor too. How’s your juggling? Outwardly you’ve got it together. Inwardly? Fine-tuning is required. \nLeo (July 22-Aug. 22) Monday’s sun-moon combo opens an opportunity centered around personal communications. You could invent a new computer or at least a new program. Consider the P.R. potential of a trailblazing blog. \nVirgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22) As lucky Jupiter continues to launch his magic thunderbolts from your sign, you feel increasingly psychic. Make a decision Monday regarding your bank account, then act on it. Happily, the help you may seek comes through someone close.\nLibra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22) The mysterious moon and sizzling sun spark a moment of truth as they appear for their annual meet-up in your sign. It’s always special, but this rendezvous — with lucky Jupiter waiting in the wings for a year-long visit — is a big deal. \nScorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21) Even the most evolved Scorpio requires a reality check once in a while. With the sun and moon blitzing through your mystery house, nothing feels sacred. Sensuous Scorps cram so much into life that stray details are often shoved under the rug. \nSagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 20) The portentous new moon joins the sun in your “dream house” on Monday. Quick! Make a wish. Visualize the result. How would you feel? Who would you tell? You know what you want. Now get clear on the outcome. \nCapricorn (Dec. 21-Jan. 18) Much of 2015 has been about passing “Go.” Come Monday, you pull the “Get out of jail free” card. Now at last you get a breather. A psychic type like you doesn’t need a gypsy.\nAquarius (Jan. 19-Feb. 17) The pressure’s been building for a long time. You crave adventure and will find it one way or another. Is a decision in order? Look for Monday’s new moon to throw light on the situation. \nPisces (Feb. 18-March 19) Does anyone really understand how hard you struggle to keep Humpty Dumpty together? Happily, Monday’s sun-moon rendezvous heralds a solution to a joint funds issue. It’s called good karma.\nMinerva’s mailbag\nQ: Now that my karmic Saturn return has left Scorpio ... Born 6/15/56, what fate awaits with Saturn in Sagittarius? \nA: Saturn returns are biggies. With the first (which happens when one is between 27 and 31) a person leaves youth behind and enters adulthood. With the second — 30 years later — it’s about maturity. Next on the agenda is Saturn’s residence in your one-on-one house. Partnerships of all kinds will come up for re-examinations. This can be a positive thing. Decisions will be made. Things that you’ve worked hard for will finally come through. Facing reality brings not only wisdom but freedom.\nTo ask Minerva a question, go to www.askminerva.com or write to Minerva, Sunday Datebook, San Francisco Chronicle , 901 Mission St., San Francisco, CA 94103.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T14:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:01:32.108+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
