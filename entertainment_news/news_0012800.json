Game 1 starter Jon Lester has a reputation of excelling in the postseason, and he threw seven innings of two-hit ball Sept. 9 at Busch Stadium. Kyle Hendricks, who will start Game 2, only faced the Cardinals once this season, giving up four earned runs over five innings May 5. In his last two outings, Hendricks pitched six scoreless in each. But he might not have a chance to pitch that deep as Joe Maddon could employ his entire bullpen to seize a victory.\nCubs fans should keep a close eye on Cardinals Game 1 starter John Lackey â€” a probable free agent target who played with Lester and David Ross in Boston. Lackey was 2-0 against the Cubs and pitched much younger than his age (36) this season. Left-hander Jaime Garcia, who will start Game 2, didn't face the Cubs because of shoulder and groin injuries. Game 3-4 starters Michael Wacha and Lance Lynn were knocked around twice in September starts against the Cubs. The loss of Carlos Martinez lessens a once-dominant edge for the Cardinals in this department.\nEdge: Cardinals.\nBullpen\nThe Cubs' bullpen was largely responsible for four of their 11 losses to the Cardinals. Pedro Strop was 0-2 with a 9.82 ERA in 11 appearances against the Cardinals. Hector Rondon (three saves, 1.13 ERA in nine games) was more effective, but Fernando Rodney might have to play a bigger role because the Cubs could be with one fewer reliever in the best-of-five series. Clayton Richard, Trevor Cahill and Travis Wood could spell Jason Hammel, the tentative Game 4 starter.\nWinning the National League Central resulted in a well-deserved break for a Cardinals bullpen that posted a 2.82 ERA. Left-hander Kevin Siegrist led the majors with 81 appearances, with less-effective Seth Maness used in 76 games. The Cubs collected only five hits in 29 at-bats against hard-throwing closer Trevor Rosenthal. Manager Mike Matheny was able to use his relievers frequently because the Cardinals had numerous pitchers with minor-league options. Matheny now can choose Adam Wainwright, a former closer, in a limited role.\nEdge: Cardinals.\nOffense\nThe Cubs scored 30 runs in their final four victories against a Cardinals pitching staff that looked vulnerable. The Cubs simply went for the kill early and succeeded. Arguably the biggest key to the Cubs' offense will be leadoff batter Dexter Fowler, who batted .194 with 19 strikeouts in 19 games against the Cardinals. Kyle Schwarber was hitless in 12 at-bats, and he and Fowler will need to get on base to set up run-scoring opportunities for Anthony Rizzo (.323, 16 RBIs) and Starlin Castro (.310, 19 RBIs).\nInjuries have challenged a Cardinals offense known for working deep counts and collecting key hits. The Cardinals batted only .242 with runners in scoring position (six points higher than the Cubs) during the regular season. Matt Holliday missed seven weeks because of a right quad strain and batted only .182 in 22 at-bats after his return in mid-September. Kolten Wong and Jason Heyward, both left-handed hitters, haunted the Cubs during the regular season. Look for Maddon to try to neutralize them and take his chances with the Cardinals' right-handed hitters.\nEdge : Even.\nFielding\nLook for Maddon move his players around, according to the situation. The Cardinals were tied for 11th in the NL with 69 steals, but they're bound to test Lester's ability to hold baserunners if given the opportunity. There are no quirky angles or goofy dimensions at Busch Stadium, which shouldn't hurt the Cubs.\nThe Cardinals' biggest concern remains the left thumb of Gold Glove catcher Yadier Molina. Counterpart Miguel Montero noticed Molina never wore a batting glove under his mitt until after he was injured while making a tag on Rizzo on Sept. 20. Heyward's defense in right field will make the Cubs think twice about trying to take the extra base.\nEdge: Cubs.\nManager\nMaddon's tirade toward the Cardinals three weeks ago fueled the intensity of the rivalry. While Maddon has gushed about the tradition and success of the Cardinals since his childhood, he knows they're vulnerable and will use every resource to exploit their weaknesses.\nNo manager in baseball did a better job of coping with injuries than Matheny, who might have to manage more creatively and aggressively against a hot Cubs team.\nEdge: Cubs.\nSeries winner : Cardinals in 5.\nPrivacy Policy Major League Baseball Baseball St. Louis Cardinals Chicago Cubs Joe Maddon Jon Lester Jason Heyward", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5616f467/turbine/ct-edge-cubs-cardinals-spt-1009-20151008"], "published": "2015-10-09T01:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:01:42.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
