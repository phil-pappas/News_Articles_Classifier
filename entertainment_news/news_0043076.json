For all the hatred and venom spewed out in the border, India and Pakistanâ€™s players have always maintained a good relations. Recently, constant firing at the border has spilled over on to the pitch despite many of the players being adored by the cricket viewing Indian public. \nLegendary Pakistan singer Ghulam Ali, who enjoys a massive fan following in India, was denied access to enter the country. The singer got death threats and vandals threatened to barge in and trash the venue and the concert that was supposed to take place in Mumbai never took off. \nIn India atleast, Cricket has transcended Religion and Politics and even during their playing days, Wasim Akram and Akthar were cheered in the stands. After the first edition, Pakistani cricketers were not allowed to participate in the Indian Premier League (IPL) too. \nModified Date: October 20, 2015 12:32 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T21:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:40:28.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
