One thing I never let go of, no matter how busy, was making time to volunteer at my child’s school. It’s always been a great way to stay connected to my kids and the professionals I entrust to keep them safe everyday.\nThere’s often a stigma attached to volunteering at school, which hinders some parents from taking part in what could be an extremely rewarding experience. So, let’s clear up some of those misconceptions.\n#1. The PTA is intimidating. For some people, the idea of signing up for the PTA is hive-producing because they fear they’ll be asked to help with everything under the sun. As a card-carrying member for the last seven years and a former co-chair, I can say with confidence that just isn’t true. There is no doubt school PTAs need volunteers, but they recognize everyone’s time is in short supply. They’re parents, too, after all. No one wants you to volunteer for anything you don’t actually want to be doing. Most school PTAs will make it very easy for you to donate your time. They’ll have sign-up sheets at events, or nowadays they may even send things electronically. This allows you to be choosy about where you volunteer and how often. So, go ahead. Sign up to be a book fair cashier for an hour. Help distribute items purchased through a fundraiser. Sit in on a PTA meeting and offer feedback that may help spur change in how things are done at school.\nYes, when you commit to doing anything, you are helping your school PTA, but more globally than that you’re helping causes that directly support your child and their entire school community.\n#2. I work full time and can’t come into school. Teachers are ridiculously busy these days and are asked to take on a lot more responsibility than they once were. There are book orders to assemble or projects to sort and cut. Maybe they’d like to send home a class newsletter, but don’t have the time to write it. Send the teacher a quick email to see how you can help without physically being in the classroom. Most times teachers will jump at the chance to delegate some tasks. Here’s another option to keep in mind. Class field trips and parties are on the calendar well in advance. If you can fit them into your schedule, they’re a great way to spend some quality time with your child and get to know his or her classmates, too.\n#3 No volunteer opportunities really grab my attention. Figure out what interests you and ask the school if there’s a way to incorporate that into the school setting. Maybe woodworking is your passion, or you have a job that children may find interesting. Talk to your child’s teacher about coming in to do a presentation for the class. You may just spark some interest in young minds and you make your child’s day at the same time.\n#4. I volunteered a couple years ago and it was not a good experience. That happens and it stinks. That said, don’t let that dissuade you from trying again, as the situation likely can’t be duplicated. There are new situations, new teachers, new classmates, and new leaders of the PTA all to take into account. Consider that before you write off another opportunity altogether.\n#5. Volunteering is a mom thing. No way, man! Volunteering is never gender-specific and any of the aforementioned information applies to moms and dads. Heck, it applies to siblings, grandparents or any other family member willing to offer their time. Volunteers are so valuable and will never be turned away.\nWhile volunteering is something I enjoy, and some of these ideas may spark new interest for some, volunteering is not for everyone and that is absolutely OK. At no point should a parent feel guilty for not wanting to involve themselves in that aspect of their child’s life. Parenting is hard enough without societal expectations getting in the way. Volunteer. Don’t volunteer. Just be present. In the end, that’s what truly matters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T16:05:18.703+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
