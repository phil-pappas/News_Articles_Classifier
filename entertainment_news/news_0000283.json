Photo: Joseph McGlennon \nJoseph McGlennon​ has been named winner of the William and Winifred Bowness Photography Prize, Australia's richest photography award.\nOn Wednesday evening, McGlennon won the $25,000 non-acquisitive prize for his work Florilegium #1 2014 , a richly colourful, intricately layered portrait of two macaws perched on a branch strewn with foliage and flowers, a mountain range visible in the far distance.\nMcGlennon was inspired by the work of naturalist Joseph Banks, who accompanied Captain James Cook on his 18th-century global travels, collecting botanicals along the way and compiling his findings in a series of copperplate engravings titled Florilegium .\n\"I approach it like a painting,\" says McGlennon of his work. \"There's probably a hundred layers in this photo.\"\nAdvertisement McGlennon, who spends his time between Singapore and Sydney and has worked as a creative director in design and marketing, picked up his camera five years ago after a long hiatus.\n\"I wanted to get back into it, but in a way different to everyone else,\" he says. He uses a Hasselblad medium format digital camera to capture his images, which can take over a month to complete, from concept to photography to post-production. He sketches his ideas before setting out to create the scenes he envisages. \"I'm not one of those photographers who walks around with a camera all the time,\" he says. \"I make photographs, I don't take them.\"\nOne thing McGlennon does carry around is a pair of secateurs.\n\"I'm literally walking around with a pair of secateurs in my back pocket because you never know when the flowers are out,\" he says.\n\"I just pull over and I get out and I start cutting things off trees. I've nearly been arrested a couple of times.\"\nThe judging panel for this year's Bowness Prize included artist Bill Henson, Bendigo Art Gallery director Karen Quinlan​ and the Monash Gallery of Art senior curator Stephen Zagala​.\nAll finalists' photographs will be presented at the Monash Gallery of Art until Sunday, November 22.\nmga.org.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:48:21.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
