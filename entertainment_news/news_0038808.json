Comment Tags Shonda Rhimes , Still Star-Crossed , TV series BEVERLY HILLS, CA - AUGUST 04: Executive producer Shonda Rhimes speaks onstage during the 'Grey's Anatomy,' 'Scandal,' and 'How To Get Away With Murder' panel discussion at the ABC Entertainment portion of the 2015 Summer TCA Tour at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on August 4, 2015 in Beverly Hills, California.

The woman behind a string of hit TV series is said to be producing a \"Romeo & Juliet\" sequel, said to be titled \"Still Star-Crossed.\" Like Us on Facebook Rhimes, in collaboration with Betsy Beers, and Heather Mitchell, will whip up an ABC show that \"will follow the conflicts between the Capulets and Montagues that arise after Romeo and Juliet's deaths,\" Time said. That considered, it's likely the series will include much flashbacks to the time when the lovers were still alive to tie their story firmly into the plot and help transition viewers into relating with new, and even old, characters. \"Written by Mitchell, Still Star-Crossed is based on the book by Melinda Taub,\" Deadline said. \"Set in 16th century Verona after the events in William Shakespeare's tragedy, it follows the conflict between the Capulets and the Montagues in the wake of Romeo and Juliet's deaths.\" \"In the book, to end the family feud, Prince Escalus orders the most eligible Montague bachelor, Benvolio, Romeo's best friend, to marry Juliet's older cousin, Capulet maid Rosaline, the girl Romeo first loved,\" the entertainment news site continued. \"Meanwhile, Lady Capulet grooms Paris - who lived through the events of Romeo and Juliet - to amass an army to dethrone the prince,\" Refinery29 added, also saying that \"Romeo and Juliet isn't a love story: It's a cautionary tale about the dangers of teenage infatuation.\" Sounds like an adult series hiding behind a teen-themed veneer. This project is somewhat new for Shondaland, considering it taps into the young adult romance genre. Rhimes' other works, such as \"Grey's Anatomy, \"Private Practice,\" and \"How to Get Away With Murder,\" explore rather adult themes. However, \"Still Star-Crossed\" isn't the only series deviating from Rhimes' usual fare. \"This development season, the production company is varying its slate with a wide range of projects in the works at ABC from a Catholic nun drama, a suburban singles comedy, and a Baghdad-set military drama project from another 'Grey's Anatomy' alum,\" Variety noted. Mitchell, the series' scribe, had previously worked on \"Scandal\" and \"Grey's Anatomy.\" \"She has written a number of episodes, including this season's buzzed-about Episode 2 titled 'Yes,' in which Olivia Pope admitted that she was the President's mistress,\" Deadline said. No specific date has been announced regarding the new show's launch. What do you think about this new series? Comment and let us know what you think!
