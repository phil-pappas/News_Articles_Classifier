However, as Homeland always strives to be subversive in its own right and a stimulus for conversation, we can't help but admire this act of artistic sabotage.\" \nIn other words, we appreciate the publicity. \nThe artists said there job was to lend authenticity to a set outside Berlin meant to portray a Syrian refugee camp. \nIt seems they did their job. \n\"The set decoration had to be completed in two days, for filming on the third,\" they said in a statement. \"Set designers were too frantic to pay any attention to us; they were busy constructing a hyper-realistic set that addressed everything from the plastic laundry pins to the frayed edges of outdoor plastic curtains. It looked very Middle Eastern and the summer sun and heat helped heighten that illusion. The content of what was written on the walls, however, was of no concern.\" Advertisement \nTime reports Amin -- a self-described \"Egyptian visual artist, researcher and, currently, visiting assistant professor at the American University in Cairo\" -- didn't respond to a request for comment.
