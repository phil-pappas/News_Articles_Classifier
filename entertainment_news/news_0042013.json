The fan, overcome by emotion (and perhaps other things), couldn't stop touching her hero. \n\"She's kissing my neck!\" Perry said to the crowd as the girl, who was wearing a smiley-face bra and who was identified by some sources as Rayane, dazedly hugged the \"I Kissed a Girl\" and \"Roar\" singer. \nThe girl wouldn't stop, and Perry, finding other parts of her anatomy being clutched, let out some surprised whoops. \nThe girl did get at least one selfie for her trouble -- and took the opportunity to kiss Perry again. \nAs the girl departed the stage, Perry gave her a playful slap on the butt.
