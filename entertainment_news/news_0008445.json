The Canadian pop star was snapped enjoying the sunshine while on holiday in Bora Bora with a companion, thought to be his girlfriend.\nThe Hollywood Reporter says a cease and desist letter has been sent to the New York Daily News demanding the nude photos are taken off its website.\nThe photos were put online earlier this week and the letter demands they are removed within 12 hours of its receipt.\nHowever, the images, which appear to have been taken by a paparazzo with a long lens, are still visible now.\nThey show the Baby singer, with his peroxide blonde hair, on the veranda of an ocean bungalow and getting into a pool.\nSome internet users thought they might have been doctored to look like Bieber but his legal team appear to have confirmed they are real.\n\"We recently became informed that your company has obtained and is distributing unauthorised photographs of our client including images showing him without clothing,\" reads the letter.\nThey argued that the publication of the images breaches his publicity and privacy rights.\nBieber has not commented on the photos but has been updating his fans with his news on Instagram and Twitter.\nAn Instagram photo showing him posing with his guitar by the pool in Bora Bora has been liked over 1.1 million times.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:57:33.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
