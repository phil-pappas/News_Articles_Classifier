I don't go with any preconceived thoughts and will react accordingly.\"\nArrieta, a 22-game winner in the regular season who was 17-1 during a 21-game stretch before Monday's game, wasn't as sharp and \"that may speak to a little bit of fatigue, possibly,\" Maddon said. \"I'm not sure.\"\nArrieta, however, said he felt strong after throwing a bullpen session Thursday.\n\"Obviously, there are certain things you can't control,\" Arrieta said before Saturday's Game 1. \"But physically, my body feels great. There's some still some work for me to be done, and I don't think I've gotten to the end of my leash yet.\"\nMaddon said he was more willing to let Arrieta pitch a 113-pitch complete game against the Pirates in the NL wild-card game on Oct. 7 \"just because of the magnitude of the situation.\"\nArrieta was 2-0 this year with a 1.13 ERA in two starts against a Mets lineup that has been upgraded significantly since.\nCubs' Joe Maddon on Jake Arrieta's preparation Cubs manager Joe Maddon discusses pitcher Jake Arrieta's preparation.\nCubs manager Joe Maddon discusses pitcher Jake Arrieta's preparation.\nSee more videos \"I'll take some notes and kind of see what I can gather,\" Arrieta said.\nBerry added: Outfielder Quintin Berry was added to the 25-man NLCS roster in place of shortstop Addison Russell, who will miss the series with a moderate strain of his left hamstring.\nBerry has stolen 27 bases in 28 attempts in his major-league career. Maddon thinks there could be more pinch-running opportunities in the series and that's why he didn't add an infielder to replace Russell.\nLeft-handed hitting outfielder Chris Coghlan also can play the infield.\nThe Cubs elected to keep their 11-man pitching staff intact. The biggest test could occur in Game 4 if the Cubs empty their bullpen for Game 3.\nMaddon hasn't decided who will start Games 3 and 4, but Kyle Hendricks and Jason Hammel are the primarily candidates.\nRested relievers: Maddon was delighted Jon Lester and Arrieta were starting the first two games, with the expectation that their endurance will allow the bullpen to get more rest.\n\"I was concerned earlier,\" said Maddon, noting that Pedro Strop appeared in 76 games and closer Hector Rondon 72 — each career highs.\n\"We were able to back off.
