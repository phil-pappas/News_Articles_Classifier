STEP RIGHT UP: Illumination organiser Dean O'Shannessey at his Night Market shop Silver Gem, where people can get tickets and artists can get forms. PICTURE: ANNA ROGERS Source: News Corp Australia \nPRODUCER Nick West has given partygoers a sneak peek of what he’ll be bringing to this weekend’s Illumination event at AJ Hackett. \nThe Sydney-based artist will perform under the name Shades of Gray (SoG) on Saturday night (though he will be without SoG partner in crime Michal Ruzicka).“For this festival ... it’ll be a bit more of a Berlin sound,” he said. \nThe artist counts Illumination organiser Dean O’Shannessey as a long-time friend. GET READY: This weekend’s Illumination event will be a cracker. PICTURE: SILVER GEM CAIRNS Source: Supplied \n“Dean’s always supported our music. He’s also supported my record label Beef Records,” he said. \n“It was good to get the call this year just to come up and play some of my new material.” \nWhile the artist agrees the music of SoG is electronic, West shies away from categorising the music SoG creates. \n“Our music is about making dance floors move and ... creating a really good atmosphere.” \nAlso appearing on this year’s line-up will be fellow Sydney artist Modifi. \n“I’ve known Modifi for years and he’s actually friends with Dean as well,” said West. \nIllumination is on this Saturday at AJ Hackett (Cairns) from 7pm. \nTickets are only available pre-sale and are available from oztix.com.au and in person at Silver Gem (Cairns Night Markets) and Shiva Moon (Grafton Street). \nTickets will also be available at the IGA at the Campus Shopping Village, Smithfield from 5pm to midnight tomorrow. A shuttle bus is also available. \nTo book, call 0418184646 .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:34:29.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
