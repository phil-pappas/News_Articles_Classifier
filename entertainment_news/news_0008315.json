Tools \nStory Published: Oct 26, 2015 at 9:51 AM EDT Story Updated: Oct 26, 2015 at 9:51 AM EDT At the Roxy Theater in Potsdam tonight, Monday October 26-- 7:15pm- The House with live music accompaniment. The Andrew Alden Ensemble will perform live at the Roxy Theater for this cult film favorite, combining traditional instrumentation with the techniques of live circuit bending and analog tape looping to create experimental sound effects. House (1977) tells the wacky story of a Japanese schoolgirl who travels with six classmates to her ailing aunt’s creaky country home, only to come face-to-face with evil spirits, bloodthirsty pianos, attacking futons and a demonic housecat. “At times it feels as if Mr. Ôbayashi threw everything—every movie he had ever seen, every idea he had ever entertained—at the screen, using the horror genre as a big box into which he could combine the bits and pieces he wanted to sample from avant-garde cinema, Looney Tunes cartoons, schlock Italian horror and martial arts movies,” writes Manohla Dargis of The New York Times . Join the Cinema 10 crowd as we gather to watch this horror classic on the big screen. This is the sixth film in the fall 2015 series. House is directed by Nobuhiko Ôbayashi and is 88 minutes long. The film is labeled NR and contains nudity, violence and generally fake-looking gore. Follow Cinema 10 on Facebook at www.facebook.com/CinemaTen and on Twitter at @Cinema_10 for more updates.
