Like the Giants, the Tigers are one of NPB’s oldest and most storied ball clubs.\nONE World Sports, America’s Network for Global Sports , will provide exclusive U.S. TV carriage of the First Stage of the Climax Series. This best of three series begins on October 10 with Game 2 slated for October 11 and a possible Game 3, if necessary, scheduled for October 12. All games will air live at 1:00 AM ET on ONE World Sports . The network will also livestream Saturday’s and Sunday’s games from ONEWorldSports.com, and its distribution partners Verizon FiOS and RCN will, as part of the network’s recently announced “Soctober” promotion, provide a free preview of this weekend’s Climax Series games. Selected video highlights will also be made available on the network’s Watch ONE World Sports app.\nThe Climax Series is the NPB’s annual playoff process to determine the two teams, one each from NPB’s Central and Pacific Leagues, which will compete in the Japan Series – that country’s version of the World Series -- for the national championship. The winner of the Giants and Tigers match-up will face-off against the Yakult Swallows to represent the Central League in the Japan Series.\n“As a network of championship events, ONE World Sports will carry for the first time Giants’ postseason action, allowing American fans to continue cheering on Japan’s most remarkable baseball players,” said Joel Feld, Executive Vice President of Programming & Production, ONE World Sports. “Nippon Professional Baseball boasts some of the sport’s best players outside the USA and is one of Major League Baseball’s favorite hunting grounds for new talent.”\nAbout the Yomiuri Giants\nThe Giants, Japan’s most popular baseball team, are the flagship of the NPB league, long a source of high-profile talent for Major League Baseball. Japanese professional baseball began with the founding of the Yomiuri Giants in 1934 and, since the beginning; the Giants have dominated -- winning more pennants and Japan Series than any other team. MLB stars emerging from the Giants’ roster have included 2009 World Series Most Valuable Player Hideki Matsui, All-Star Hideki Okajima and the Boston Red Sox’s Koji Uehara. MLB players who have headed to Japan to wear the Yomiuri Giants uniform include: Davey Johnson, former manager of the Washington Nationals and 2012 National League Manager of the Year; New York Yankees’ star outfielder, Roy White; seven-time All-Star Reggie Smith; All-Star pitcher Clyde Wright; and Warren Cromartie. Joining the team for 2015, both from the Texas Rangers, are pitchers Aaron Poreda and Miles Mikolas. Among the team’s current stars is pitcher Tomoyuki Sugano, 2014 MVP in NPB’s Central League.\nAbout ONE World Sports\nONE World Sports is America’s Network for Global Sports, producing best-in-class, captivating live sports content from around the world.
