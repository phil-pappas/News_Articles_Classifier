But perhaps they missed the news from across the pond: Reno's fiance, Scot Young, committed suicide last year after a history of mental illness and serious money issues, which were detailed on the show. \nHer co-star Annabelle Neilson tells ABC Radio that although she hasn't spoken to her, other cast members have and they say she's doing well. \n\"She's a girl who will bounce back even with this tragedy,\" Neilson added. \"But as I know, from personal experience, everybody's different.\" \nNeilson suffered a loss when her close friend, fashion designer Alexander McQueen committed suicide in 2010. Her grieving process was on the show's first season. \n\"It takes everybody a different amount of time to deal with it,\" Neilson continued. \"And it will always be there. She'll carry it with her for the rest of her life and it's not something I'd wish upon anybody.\" \nNeilson has tons of famous friends. From the late McQueen to Naomi Campbell -- who will appear this season on Ladies of London -- to Jude Law to Richard Branson to Kate Moss. Still, the fashion model and socialite tells ABC Radio why she thinks Moss is her coolest friend. \n\"Because she's so normal and yet she's so extraordinary,\" Neilson gushed. \"She's got an amazing light around her, but yet she's the girl next door. I can't think of a negative.\" \nBravo's Ladies of London airs Mondays at 10 p.m. Eastern. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
