(March 20 - April 19): Say good-bye to a source of revenue that cost more than what you made from it. Don't worry. You're moving on to something better.\nTAURUS. (April 20 - May 20): You have second thoughts about a commitment, but see it through. Even if things stumble at the starting gate, you'll regain your footing.\nGEMINI. (May 21 - June 20): It feels like nothing less than a fresh start will do, but a minor adjustment is all it takes to bring about the changes you crave.\nCANCER. (June 21 - July 21): Are you horning in on someone else's turf? Back off before there's trouble. This person will defend his/her interests tooth and claw.\nLEO. (July 22 - Aug. 22): A nagging problem is symptomatic of a greater headache. Take a chill pill. Big answers come in small packages and you need to focus.\nVIRGO. (Aug. 23 - Sept. 22): Accepting a limit as a limit doesn't mean throwing in the towel. It means you can stop banging your head against the wall and start examining options.\nLIBRA. (Sept. 23 - Oct. 22): The coast is clear! The usual killjoys are too preoccupied with their own crises to cause you much grief now. Gently push your agenda.\nSCORPIO. (Oct. 23 - Nov. 21): You need to get out of the either/or headspace. It's limiting and could hamper progress. You're fixating on half when you can have it all.\nSAGITTARIUS. (Nov. 22 - Dec. 20): It's important to negotiate the finer points. A lot rides on the turn of phrase or semantics of a clause. Dollar signs are in the details.\nCAPRICORN. (Dec. 21 - Jan. 19): It looks like you can only go with one action or another. Actually you've a third choice - which is a composite of the two. Check it out.\nAQUARIUS. (Jan. 20 - Feb. 17): You haven't heard the last of a private matter. But you don't have to live in dread either. Given time, the situation will right itself.\nPISCES. (Feb. 18 - March 19): You supported someone in an endeavor and now he/she wants to return the favor. This is encouraging. Embrace the spirit of cooperation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:14:15.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
