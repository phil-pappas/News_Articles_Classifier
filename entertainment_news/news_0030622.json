When nostalgia goes bad. \nIf you're going to tap into nostalgia, you have to do it right. \nHollywood repeatedly learns this lesson when fans clamor for a favorite TV show or movie to return ... and are then inevitably disappointed by the reboot. However misguided reboots are, there's usually at least one aspect that makes viewers consider reinvesting. Maybe it's to see how certain TV actors aged (\"Dallas\"); to hold out hope that this remake will be better than the last remake (\"Batman Begins\"); or even seeing old cartoons in CGI (\"Alvin and the Chipmunks.\") \nBut sometimes there's just a complete disaster. Enter the live-action \"Jem and the Holograms,\" a movie based on the delightful '80s Hasbro syndicated cartoon about a music executive (rocking some seriously colorful hair) who doubles as a rock star. The film, which hit theaters this weekend, is an example of truly botched nostalgia. \nReally, the \"Jem and the Holograms\" adaptation was dead on arrival. Last spring, the movie got a strange, rushed announcement - and Christy Marx, the creator of the original cartoon, said she was given zero notice. Plus, Marx pointed out the oddity of an all-male development team adapting a series about women. Fans weren't happy: \"We've waited 29 years for a live action 'Jem' movie,\" said one writer at io9. \"But now every piece of news we hear about this project makes us want to rip out our pink hair and weep.\" \nThe trailer dropped in May with \"Nashville\" star Aubrey Peeples as Jem, a regular girl who turns into a rock star. The modern twist is that this is thanks to a YouTube video gone viral. She brings her sisters along as her band, but things go south when she's urged to be a solo act. The trailer was ripped apart by the Internet. The most frequent complaints were: the tone was all wrong; the story looked nothing like the cartoon; there was no sign of rival band the Misfits. The producer defensively urged fans not to judge a movie by its trailer ... but what else did they have to go on? Trailer: JEM and the Holograms \nIn Theaters October 23. As a small-town girl catapults from underground video sensation to global superstar, she and her three sisters begin a journey of discovering that some talents are too special to keep hidden. \nIn Theaters October 23.

It offers not a fantastically fabulous young woman and her equally bad-ass rock star friends, but rather a somewhat generic coming-of-age origin story,\" Forbes wrote. \"It's a little disheartening to see the often spectacular and occasionally crazy source material turned into another generic 'young girl doesn't believe in herself and then gets corrupted by fame' fable.\" \nNaturally, the reviews are brutal. Variety notes that the movie \"exists only because of nostalgia for the animated source material. And yet the film seems inexplicably embarrassed by its roots, instead serving up half-baked and self-consciously contemporary drama that no one in the sure-to-be minimal theatrical audience will remember quite so fondly some 30 years on.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T19:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:13:51.848+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
