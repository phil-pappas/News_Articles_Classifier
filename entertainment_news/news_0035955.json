World Champion and Olympian, Jinjing Zhang, has joined our boys competitive team coaching staff. Bringing a wealth of knowledge and tremendous international competitive experience, Jinjing will assist boys competitive team head coach Michael Ashe. “Jinjing will increase our level of enrollment and the quality of gymnastics across the board,” Ashe said. “He has the unique ability to work outside of the box and present skills differently to each athlete, helping the team better understand skill technique. Jinjing can be playful but also incredibly intense, depending on what the situation calls for. Most importantly, he is a problem solver.”\nA multi-award winner for the Chinese national team, Jinjing won 37 gold medals in a five-year span. Jinjing competed in the 1996 Olympic Games, helping China capture the silver medal in the men’s team competition and earning fourth in the individual all-around competition. At the 1995 and 1997 World Championships, Jinging helped China win team gold. Individually, Jinjing shared the bronze medal on high bar in 1995 and was crowned the 1997 parallel bar World Champion.\nAfter outstanding international success, Jinjing attended University of California, Berkeley and competed for the Golden Bears. At the 2002 NCAA National Championships, Jinjing led the Golden Bears to a third place finish and placed second in the NCAA individual all-around. After his NCAA career, Jinjing owned Champions Academy in Morgan Hill, CA and coached NCAA all-around champion and Stanford University standout, Sho Nakamori.\nThe addition of Jinjing to the boys competitive team staff will elevate the program in numerous ways. “As a result of Jinjing here, we have a stronger coaching staff from the lower levels to the top,” Ashe said. “We are able to accommodate more kids into the program and have the coaches work with all levels. This is an opportunity to develop a positive team culture and build a strong foundation from the ground up.”\nFor more information about any of Head Over Heels Athletics Arts classes and programs, call 510-655-1265, view the various gymnastics programs on the web at http://www.hohathleticarts.com , or visit 4701 Doyle St., Building F, in Emeryville.\nAbout Head Over Heels Athletic Arts: Head Over Heels Athletic Arts has been helping children gain fitness, gymnastics skills, confidence and self-esteem for nearly 40 years.
