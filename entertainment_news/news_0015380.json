Photo Marc Stapelberg / The Northern Star Marc Stapelberg \nHow show developed \nDirector Julian Louis conceived the project more than five years ago and brought it to fruition in the highly successful 2012 Railway Wonderland production. \nAfter repeated calls for its return, Mr Louis got back on board to re-create the hit production. \n\"Going back into the world of the show is so exciting because the show has so much in it with the fact that we travel across time and tell stories of post World War II and also stories of today,\" he said. \n\"And the characters are all at these moments in their lives where the station becomes a metaphor for the big moments in life where you're about to change.\" \nStories of people's lives \nMr Louis said some of the narratives includes the story of a young man who's trying to come out to his parents, a man who's trying to reconcile with his daughter, a teenage girl who wants to leave Lismore, and elderly Ana who is trying to go home to Italy for the last time. \n\"The whole play works on these melodramas and the station just provides the most perfect platform, or backdrop, for all those stories to be told,\" he said. \nSince its inception, local historians, Southern Cross University researchers, Rail Corp staff, the local community, train enthusiasts and lobby groups have all contributed to the show's development.
