(NASDAQ: MCHP), a leading provider of microcontroller, mixed-signal, analog and Flash-IP solutions, today announced that system designers using the de-facto industry standard, MOST 速 technology , in their automotive infotainment networks can now leverage Microchip's broad product portfolio of MOST networking products to quickly bring cost-efficient CI+-based Pay TV to their cars. The MOST Cooperation recently released its latest MOST Stream Transmission Specification, which includes support for the MOST CI+ Interim License Agreement issued by CI Plus LLP . CI+ is a technical specification that provides additional security and features to the proven DVB Common Interface Standard, and now allows a MOST network to transport CI+ protected content using Digital Transmission Content Protection (DTCP). According to CI Plus, CI+ compatible consumer electronic devices, such as integrated digital televisions and set-top boxes, can access a wide range of Pay TV Services via plug-in CI+ Modules, wherever the CI+ technology is supported by the local Pay TV provider.\nTo learn more about Microchip's MOST networking products, visit http://www.microchip.com/MOST-101315a .\n\"We are proud to offer our customers a complete, easy-to-use, cost-efficient solution to transport the latest CI+ protected digital video inside automobiles,\" said Dan Termer, vice president of Microchip's Automotive Information Systems Division. \"Once again, this demonstrates Microchip's close collaboration with our customers and commitment to listening to their needs.\"\nOn the leading edge of the latest innovations in automotive infotainment, Microchip currently offers MOST Intelligent Network Interface Controllers (INICs) that support high-quality video streaming, as defined by the latest MOST Stream Transmission Specification. In addition, the approved content protection schemes for DTCP implemented in Microchip's MOST Multimedia Companion ICs allow the transport of CI+ protected content. Microchip's free DTCP software stack completes the one-stop solution for transmitting the latest digital video content inside the car.\nResources\nHigh-res MOST Technology Logo Available Through Flickr or Editorial Contact (feel free to publish): http://www.microchip.com/Logo-070715a\nFollow Microchip:\nRSS Feed for Microchip Product News: http://www.microchip.com/RSS-101315a Twitter: http://www.microchip.com/Twitter-101315a Facebook: http://www.microchip.com/Facebook-101315a YouTube: http://www.microchip.com/YouTube-101315a About Microchip Technology\nMicrochip Technology Inc.
