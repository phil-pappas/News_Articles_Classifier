Some say they will go nude if the role demands it and the money is good but Jessica, who has been in the industry for the past three years, says she is not one of them. \nShe told Myjoyonline.com in an interview that, “It depends on your definition of nudity. I wouldn't go butt naked in front of a camera. I can do something like a swim suit, a panty and a bra, if the character demands.” \nJessica Williams, born Joyce Williams, was quick to stress that, “No, I wouldn't go nude in front of a camera for what so amount,” not even $1 million or a Hollywood movie role. “No, am not a porn star,” the 26-year-old noted. \nThe pretty actress has chalked a couple of successes and has starred in several household productions. \nProminent among her works is, ‘Living with Trisha’, an award winning series shown on Viasat 1 TV in which she plays a lead role. \nShe also has series, ‘The Storm’, ‘Charade’, shown on DStv African Magic, Excapade, to her credit. For movies, Jessica has starred in ‘Rape Case, ‘Prince Sam’, ‘The Pledge’, ‘Mabr3 Agu’ among others. \nFor those who have watched Bisa Kdei’s hit music video ‘Odo Carpenter’, Jessica is that pretty lady in the wheel chair. She effortlessly played the role of a crippled wife. \nShe described herself as a very hardworking, focused, determined and versatile person, who is ready to learn and take up new challenges. “I am determined to becoming the very best in life and my career,” she said. \nJessica is the daughter of one of Ghana's formal and biggest movie producers, Alex Boateng, popularly known in the industry as Alexboat Production. \nShe had her secondary school education at Kumasi Girls Secondary School and tertiary education at the Accra Polytechnic where she studied Accounting. \nComing from a family with a history in movie making, the 26-year-old says “I have always had the passion to act and showcase my God given talent to Ghana and the world.” \nTo her, she is pegging her life’s hopes on acting and believes that, “life is all about taking risks and this is something I have a passion for and I believe I will excel in. The risk is worth taking.” \nWith several projects in the pipeline for her, Jessica believes that in the next five years, she will become one of Africa’s renowned actresses. \n“I will also love to give back to society in my own little way, by setting up a production house and giving the younger generation the platform to display their talents,” Jessica added. \n\nFollow me on Twitter: @delaXdela and Instagram: citizendela", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T11:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:01:49.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
