Her writings, characterized by plain language and detail so visceral it's sometimes painful to read, won her this year's Nobel literature prize.\nShe is an unusual choice. The Swedish Academy, which picks the prestigious literature laureates, has only twice before bestowed the award on non-fiction — to Winston Churchill and Bertrand Russell — and had never honored journalistic work with a Nobel.\nAlexievich's work straddles the divide. Much of her books are essentially oral history, where the voice is not hers and she chooses only what to include. Her narrative passages are straightforward, free of literary conceits.\n\"My calling as a writer involves me in talking to many people and examining many documents. Nothing is more fantastic than reality. I want to evoke a world not bound by the laws of ordinary verisimilitude, but fashioned in my own image,\" she wrote in her 1989 book \"Zinky Boys,\" the title a reference to zinc coffins in which the bodies of Soviet soldiers killed in Afghanistan were shipped home.\n\"Her goal is to communicate the history of human feeling. The very fact that it transcends any easy category is part of what makes it great,\" said Andrew Kaufman, a Russian literature scholar at the University of Virginia.\nThe 67-year-old Alexievich's books have been published in 19 countries, with at least five of them translated into English. She also has written three plays and screenplays for 21 documentary films. She is the 14th woman to win the award since 1901.\nSwedish Academy head Sara Danius praised Alexievich as a great and innovative writer who has \"mapped the soul\" of the Soviet and post-Soviet people.\n\"She transcends the format of journalism and has developed a new literary genre, which bears her trademark. That doesn't mean there aren't predecessors — there are, absolutely — but she has taken the genre further,\" Danius told The Associated Press.\nLike many intellectuals in Belarus, Alexievich supports the political opponents of authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko, who is up for re-election on Sunday. Because of her criticism of the government, she has periodically lived abroad — including in Italy, France, Germany and Sweden — but now lives in Minsk, the Belarusian capital.\n\"They don't print my books here. I can't speak anywhere publicly. Belarusian television never invites me,\" Alexievich said. State TV made only cursory mention of her award on its nightly newscast, nine minutes into the program.\nLate Thursday, Lukashenko issued a brief statement of congratulation to Alexievich, saying \"I am truly happy for your success. I hope your award will serve our state and the Belarusian people.\"\nYaraslau Kryvoi, secretary of the Anglo-Belarusian Society, said the award means \"Belarus is now on the political map of the world.\"\nLukashenko has shown signs that he's trying to improve relations with the West and resist Russia's presumed interest in absorbing Belarus. The Swedish Academy says it makes its choices only on literary merit and doesn't consider politics.\nAlexievich's first book, \"War's Unwomanly Face,\" published in 1985, was based on the previously untold stories of women who had fought against Nazi Germany. It sold more than 2 million copies.\nAlexievich said she was at home ironing when she received the call Thursday from the academy with news that filled her both with joy and trepidation.\n\"How am I going to keep this up?\" she asked rhetorically.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:30:41.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
