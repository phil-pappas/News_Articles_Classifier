The orchestra had previously left open when he would start.\nOn Tuesday, it said Petrenko will take over at the beginning of the 2019-2020 season but will give a limited number of concerts in his first year because of his duties at the Bavarian State Opera.\nBavaria's state culture ministry said earlier Tuesday that Petrenko had agreed to stay on beyond 2018, when his existing contract expired. He will remain the Munich opera house's musical director until August 2020, and will be a guest conductor in the 2020-21 season.\nBerlin Philharmonic general manager Martin Hoffmann said the Munich and Berlin orchestras had reached \"an amicable agreement on all scheduling issues.\nIn Berlin, Petrenko is to appear as a guest conductor starting in 2016. The Philharmonic said he will conduct several concert programs both in Berlin and on tour in the 2018-2019 season, prior to formally taking over the orchestra.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Petrenko will be both musical director in Munich and the Berlin Philharmonic chief conductor for one year rather than two.\nHumanities Performing Arts Berlin Philharmonic Kirill Petrenko Bavarian State Opera", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:48:41.123+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
