Hugh Jackman and co-star Rooney Mara were in attendance, joined by Levi Miller and Garrett Hedlund . Mara, who stars in the film as Tiger Lily, looked so gorgeous donning a flowery turtle neck white dress with black velvet ruffles on the waist and hips. She kept her style simple as she chose a pair of black basic pump shoes and didn't wear any accessory. She showed off her natural beauty by wearing minimal makeup and having her hair slicked back. Meanwhile, Jackman, who portrays pirate Blackbeard in the film, suited up for a dapper look. Although he just returned from a trip to Japan to promote the adventure film, he looked so fresh and radiant. He also posed for photographers in front of a poster of himself in full costume as the pirate Blackbeard before Miller joined him. Hedlund, Miller, Mara and Jackman also posed together for photographers. It seemed like that day was a family day. Naomi Watts and partner Liev Schreiber were spotted taking their sons, six-year-old Sam and eight-year-old Peter, to the premiere. Another reason they attended the event was probably to support Watt's fellow Australian actor Jackman. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Pan News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:34:19.618+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
