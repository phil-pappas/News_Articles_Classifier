Nearly one-third of consumers said they looked online overall for Halloween costumes.\n\"I post stuff after I pick out my outfit,\" especially on Facebook and Instagram, said Jessica Medina, 33, as she shopped at the Spirit Halloween store. \"I also search online to see what's out there and my friends post things.\"\nThe impact of social media \"has been exponential,\" said Jeff Green, a Phoenix-based retail consultant. \"The growth that's occurred in Halloween spending over the last 10 years has almost mirrored that of the growth in social media.\n\"It's more of a social holiday now, with 'social' meaning that people not only are enjoying Halloween with one another but sending it out to the world.\"\nConsumer spending on Halloween still pales next to the winter holiday season, which includes Thanksgiving and Christmas and generates about $616 billion in sales. Halloween spending also trails spending on Mother's Day, Valentine's Day and Father's Day.\nThat's mainly because \"Halloween is not a gift-giving holiday\" much beyond candy for the kids, said National Retail Federation spokeswoman Kathy Grannis Allen.\nNonetheless, \"it's still a huge business for a retailer,\" she said, although Halloween retail sales are expected to dip this year compared with 2014 in part because many consumers are re-using Halloween props and decorations they'd bought in recent years.\n\"We really think it comes down to several years of stocking up on Halloween goods and this year using more of what they already have,\" Allen said. Spending on decorations is expected to total $1.9 billion this year, down 7 percent from last year.\n\"We're not disappointed with what we're seeing with Halloween this year in any fashion,\" she said.\nOther items are perishable, of course, such as candy and pumpkins. Nine out of 10 Americans are forecast to buy candy this year, spending a total of $2.1 billion, slightly less than the $2.2 billion spent last year.\nAbout 41 percent of Americans also will carve a fresh pumpkin. Most pumpkins grown in California are for Halloween sales, which last year totaled $31 million in the state, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nCalifornia produces the most pumpkins for the fresh market (192 million pounds last year) of any state, and nearly three-quarters of California's pumpkins are grown in the San Joaquin Valley, according to the University of California.\nAnother trend is the continued growth of temporary, or \"pop-up,\" Halloween stores that lease space in vacant stores or other buildings for the six weeks leading to Halloween.\nSpirit Halloween, a privately held affiliate of the Spencer's retail chain, claims to be the largest operator of such stores.\nAnother big player is Party City, which sells Halloween items in its conventional stores and in 300 temporary Halloween City stores. Halloween is crucial to the company, accounting for 25 percent of Party City's $1.6 billion in annual retail sales.\nThen there are the haunted theme-park attractions, such as Knott's \"Scary Farm\" and \"Fright Fest\" at Six Flags Entertainment Corp.'s Magic Mountain, both in the LA area.\nKnott's doesn't break out its Halloween-related revenue, nor does its parent company, publicly held Cedar Fair LP, but Knott's has said the Scary Farm generates about 15 percent of its annual attendance.\nThe Scary Farm, which runs 24 nights from late September through Oct. 31, also generates added revenue because it requires a separate admission (starting at $39.99) from Knott's Berry Farm in the daytime.\n\"It's a very profitable and valuable part of our fiscal year,\" Knott's spokesman Jason Soyster said. \"Parks like Knott's have capitalized on this overwhelming consumer interest in the Halloween season.\"\nOthers prefer to stay near home, handing out candy or joining parties. They include Medina, who said she and her husband try to keep their family's Halloween spending under $200 but find it tough.\n\"I try to,\" Medina said as she prepared to try on a $60 pirate costume. \"But it never happens because my husband and I are huge Halloween fans.\"\n(c)2015 Los Angeles Times\nVisit the Los Angeles Times at www.latimes.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nGRAPHIC (for help with images, contact 312-222-4194):\nVIDEO (for help with video, contact 312-222-4196):\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/business/businessnews/s-1738942", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/business/businessnews/s-1738942&h=Americans+are+expected+to+spend+%246%2E9+billion+on+Halloween+this+year", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/business/businessnews/s-1738942&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:06:55.705+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
