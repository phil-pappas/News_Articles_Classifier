That all changed with the release of Center Stage in 2000, a dance movie that made sleepover-age girls everywhere reconsider that dusty pair of ballet shoes in the back of the closet. \"Maybe I could do this again,\" they thought, \"and find a cute boyfriend, too!\" Sadly, it was too late for all those would-be Misty Copelands, but Center Stage lives on as a classic of the dance movie genre. Where else can you see people grooving to Jamiroquai en pointe ? Here's what the cast is up to now.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below Amanda Schull Share Tweet Pin E-mail Columbia/Getty More From Cosmopolitan Then: Amanda played Jody Sawyer, the movie's central protagonist and the top point of a sexy ballet love triangle. She didn't have great feet, but neither did Margo Fonteyn!\nNow: Since winning herself a spot as a principal in Cooper Nielsen's dance company, Amanda has mostly stuck to TV with recurring roles on One Tree Hill , 12 Monkeys , Suits , and Pretty Little Liars , on which she played the woman with whom Aria's dad had an affair. Next she'll appear with Milo Ventimiglia in the horror movie Devil's Gate .\nZoe Saldana Share Tweet Pin E-mail Columbia/Getty Then: As Eva Rodriguez, Zoe Saldana was Center Stage 's resident ballerina with attitude. She wore the wrong color leotard, thought Juliette Simone had a stick up her ass, and had no patience for Maureen's shenanigans. She got the last laugh in the end, though, subbing in for Maureen during the final showcase and impressing everyone with her swanlike skills.\nNow: Let's put it this way — if Zoe Saldana were in an ensemble ballet movie today, she'd definitely be the Jody Sawyer. In addition to having major roles in three huge franchises ( Avatar , Star Trek , and Guardians of the Galaxy ), she's also found success in smaller films like Colombiana and Out of the Furnace . This winter she'll star as Nina Simone in the controversial biopic Nina .\nPeter Gallagher Share Tweet Pin E-mail Columbia/Getty Then: Peter played Jonathan Reeves, the American Ballet Academy's main choreographer and director. He terrified everyone because he was so demanding and/or because his eyebrows were so big they defied logic.\nNow: Hello! This is Sandy Cohen — the man, the myth, the legend. After he wrapped up his stint as the corniest DILF in Newport Beach on The O.C. , Peter reprised his role as Jonathan in the 2008 made-for-TV Center Stage sequel, Center Stage: Turn It Up . He's also enjoyed TV success on shows like Law & Order: SVU , Togetherness , and Californication , and has recently surfaced on Broadway in shows like The Country Girl and On the Twentieth Century . His eyebrow game remains strong.\nIlia Kulik Share Tweet Pin E-mail Columbia/Getty Advertisement - Continue Reading Below", "external_links": ["http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1600x800/landscape-1443733544-zoe-saldana.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/768x384/gallery-1443733544-zoe-saldana.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/980x490/gallery-1443733610-ilia-kulik.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/640x320/gallery-1443733610-ilia-kulik.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1600x800/landscape-1443733500-amanda-schull.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/480x240/gallery-1443733610-ilia-kulik.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/768x384/gallery-1443733610-ilia-kulik.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1600x800/gallery-1443733544-zoe-saldana.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1600x800/gallery-1443733578-peter-gallagher.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/480x240/gallery-1443733500-amanda-schull.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/640x320/gallery-1443733500-amanda-schull.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/480x240/gallery-1443733578-peter-gallagher.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1280x640/gallery-1443733544-zoe-saldana.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/768x384/gallery-1443733578-peter-gallagher.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1600x800/landscape-1443733578-peter-gallagher.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/980x490/gallery-1443733544-zoe-saldana.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/640x320/gallery-1443733578-peter-gallagher.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1600x800/landscape-1443733610-ilia-kulik.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/980x490/gallery-1443733578-peter-gallagher.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/980x490/gallery-1443733500-amanda-schull.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/640x320/gallery-1443733544-zoe-saldana.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1600x800/gallery-1443733610-ilia-kulik.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/768x384/gallery-1443733500-amanda-schull.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/480x240/gallery-1443733544-zoe-saldana.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1600x800/gallery-1443733500-amanda-schull.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1280x640/gallery-1443733610-ilia-kulik.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1280x640/gallery-1443733578-peter-gallagher.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1280x640/gallery-1443733500-amanda-schull.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T01:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:13:32.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
