Gary Gray , who made waves this summer with his profitable and critically acclaimed N.W.A biopic \"Straight Outta Compton,\" has been set to direct the eighth film in the \"Fast & Furious\" franchise. Gray announced the news on his Facebook page on Thursday and Universal Pictures confirmed. Star and producer Vin Diesel posted a photo of himself and Gray with some \"Fast & Furious\" images on Facebook earlier this week, hinting that the \"Compton\" director was indeed the front runner to take over the extremely successful series. \"Furious 7,\" released earlier this year, grossed a staggering $1.5 billion worldwide. James Wan directed that film, which featured Paul Walker 's final appearance in the series. Walker died in 2013. The eighth installment is set for an April 14, 2017 release.
