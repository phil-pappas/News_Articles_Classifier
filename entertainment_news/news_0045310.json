The project was written by Colin Teevan, directed by Aku Louhimies and produced by Catherine Magee.\n\"As expectations of a short and glorious campaign are dashed, social stability is eroded and Irish nationalism comes to the fore,\" a news release said. \"The tumultuous events that follow are seen through the eyes of three young women and their families, lovers and friends from Belfast, Dublin and London as they play vital and conflicting roles in the narrative of Ireland's independence. Some prioritize family loyalties; some are motivated by the noblest of ideals or opportunism; while others take up arms, prepared to sacrifice everything for the dream of a better society.\"\nThe series was announced Monday at MIPCOM 2015 -- the world's entertainment content market -- in Cannes, France.\n\" Rebellion is a compelling drama rich with complex and inspiring characters, whose lives and homes are in the direst state of upheaval,\" Joel Stillerman, president of original programming and development for AMC and SundanceTV, said in a statement. \"Sharing this story about the history of Ireland and its people is so important to SundanceTV, not only because it underscores our commitment to showcasing unique voices from around the globe, but also because we believe the struggles and triumphs seen throughout the series will resonate strongly with audiences today. We're looking forward to partnering with Zodiak and RTE on bringing Rebellion to life.\"\n\"Colin Teevan and the Zodiak team have brought to life this extraordinary story full of dreams and determination and, in some cases, sheer bewilderment and desperation to give us a drama set in an extraordinary period, but with themes that carry striking contemporary resonance,\" added RTE Head of Television Drama Jane Gogan.\n  Watch 'Saturday Night Live' send up Donald Trump Rob Morrow and Kelli Williams to guest star on 'The Fosters' 'MacGyver' revival in the works at CBS, says report Miley Cyrus sings 'My Way' for mock tribute segment on 'Saturday Night Live'", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:21:47.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
