(PRWEB) October 23, 2015\nHow much do people know about politics, history and religion? In “GENERATIONS OF BETRAYAL” (published by Trafford Publishing), author NSLeumas exposes the lies he says have controlled the population of the United States of America and the world. As part of his new marketing campaign, he once again encourages readers to open their eyes by embarking on a journey toward truth.\nIn this highly controversial book, NSLeumas challenges readers’ beliefs while exposing what he calls “the bold deception that hides in plain sight.” He believes that people are lied to about politics , history and religion . This is a compilation of hidden research and truths from authoritative sources tied together with commentary and astonishing exposés. He provides readers with a list of abbreviations that will help them navigate and better understand his thorough study of world history. NSLeumas’ point of view is independent of many authors’ opinions and he acknowledges that his writings might shock or even offend some readers. Ultimately, he urges everyone to think and decide for themselves and, finally, see what is real and true.\nAn excerpt from the book:\nKeep this in-mind, as you read & learn the truth in this book—WE ALL HAVE BEEN LIED-TO ALL OUR LIVES!! The truth has been purposively-hidden from us, & has been suppressed, twisted, & covered-up . . . for 2,000-years generally, & 225-years specifically in America. When I began to discover & then to uncover all that is within these-pages—via intense research—I was appalled . . . & then angered greatly, mixed with deep-sadness; expect the same.\n“Will you like this book? At-first, probably not, but that’s why you must read it,” NSLeumas says. “Are you courageous enough to read it all?”\n“ GENERATIONS OF BETRAYAL ”\nBy NSLeumas\nHardcover | 6x9in | 690 pages | ISBN 9781490734101\nSoftcover | 6x9in | 690 pages | ISBN 9781490734132\nE-Book | 690 pages | ISBN 9781490734149\nAvailable at Amazon and Barnes & Noble\nAbout the Author\nCompiler/commentator NSLeumas is retired from the professions of music, education and publishing while continuing his literary/political/social writings and his mentoring-prison outreach. Besides being focused on his AA-Teachings, he assists an international-seeking of a “survival-homeland” for kindred-families. He relaxes by singing or piano-styling his set (“Memories & Remembering”) publicly, after voraciously studying or reading historical, philosophical, religious and economic articles since ancient times, in his isolated hermitage home in nature.\nTrafford Publishing, an Author Solutions, LLC, author services imprint, was the first publisher in the world to offer an “on-demand publishing service,” and has led the independent publishing revolution since its establishment in 1995.
