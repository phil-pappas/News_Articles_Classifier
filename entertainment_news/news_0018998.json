Jean isn’t entirely sure why: there was never any question of offering him more money than the other five main cast, and the voice actor’s concern about “the freedom to do other work” didn’t square with the fact he can record his dialogue over the internet.\nIt was a high stakes game of chicken, but Jean says the show was contractually bound to go on.\n“We would have had to replace him if he didn’t sign.\n“There was never even a time where there was a choice whether or not to do the show.”\nIn the end eight episodes were recorded without Shearer. After he relented, they were able to go back and add his characters and voices to the finished programs.\nOther Stories The horror of MH17’s final 90 seconds News 0 comments Who were Playboy’s Aussie stars?

The Simpsons executive producer Al Jean. SMITHERS IS FINALLY COMING OUT AS GAY\nIS THIS THE MAN TO SAVE THE SIMPSONS\nTHINK YOU’RE A SIMPSONS’ EXPERT?\nWhen Jean joined the show as a writer in 1989 the internet didn’t exist, and word processors were a fancy new technology. He’s been showrunner since 2001. Despite lasting for 27 seasons so far (and another season is already underway) the passion of the fans hasn’t diminished, as evidenced by the backlash to reports Marge and Homer were getting a divorce (in part due to a love interest played by Lena Dunham) in the first of the new episodes. “We never said that!” Jean says. “It was misQuote: d by CNN and the backlash was astounding. It was kind of touching that it meant so much to so many people.”\nHistoric ... The Simpsons predates the internet. Other episodes feature Sideshow Bob finally killing Bart — it’s a Halloween episode so it doesn’t count — a homage to the film Boyhood called Barthood and Sofia Vergara shows up as Bart’s new teacher.\n“He has a crush on her and so does Skinner so they have a rivalry going,” he says. She may return. “She works about a block away so it’s easy to bring her back and she was really pleasant to work with.”\nBart hasn’t had a regular teacher since Marcia Wallace, who voiced Edna Krabappel passed away in 2013. “We were never going to have anyone else do that character,” Jean says. “It’s a sad sort of function of the show being on the air 26 years.”\nA more recent loss in March was Sam Simon, who developed the show with Matt Groening and James L. Brooks. “He was to me the person most instrumental in transforming Matt’s characters from the (original Tracey Ullman Show shorts) into a fully-fledged half-hour show. He taught me how to run The Simpsons and was a real mentor to me.” And like Shearer he was famous for being as difficult as he was creative. “He described himself as difficult and who am I to argue?” Jean says wryly. “But he’s also a guy who was very talented and wanted things to be as good as they could be.” Jean predicts The Simpsons will be renewed for another two seasons, bringing it to 30 seasons and 669 episodes. “And it’s just my opinion (probably) 50/50 (chance of continuing) after that. I don’t think it will (end) because of ratings or expense, it will just be because there’d be a feeling that we have done enough. I don’t feel that now.”\nHome wrecker?
