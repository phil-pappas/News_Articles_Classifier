The tranquil expression as he sits for the majority of a game. The talking rather than yelling as players approach for instruction.\nIt's a good thing Hoiberg talks so openly about the extensive heart surgeries he has endured or some might wonder if there's a pulse behind the placidness.\nBut don't kid yourself. Don't mistake his composure for a lack of competitiveness. You don't last 10 years in the NBA as a second-round pick or revive a moribund program at your alma mater, which just happens to also be in your hometown, without some fire in your belly.\nOr maybe some soap in your mouth.\n\"The mature Cyclone fans that loved their 'Freddy came home to coach' story could probably never fathom Fred swearing in the locker room,\" Iowa State athletic director Jamie Pollard, who hired Hoiberg, said with a laugh. \"He would get animated with his team — not often and always in a pointed and constructive way. And he knew where to let that be seen and not be seen.\n\"He's all in. But you're never going to see him sweat. He's got such a calming demeanor. That's incredibly comforting to the players. He's able to keep teams in the moment.\"\nDerrick Rose showing the speed Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg is looking for K.C.

But he took it to another level,\" Gibson said. \"Those minutes he played...\n(K.C. Johnson) There's pressure everywhere in sports. Maybe it comes in the form of being a rookie NBA head coach. Maybe it's following the success and specter of Tom Thibodeau. Maybe it's game-planning to try to beat LeBron James.\nAs the NBA raises its curtain for the 2015-16 season with Cavaliers-Bulls, Hoiberg doesn't flinch from — or get ruffled by — any of it.\nHe reminds that he ran an NBA-type system at Iowa State and logged 14 years — 10 as a player, four as a Timberwolves executive — at this level. He praises Thibodeau easily and consistently. He revels in praising and parsing James' game.\nAnd he does so with the same even-keeled temperament that defines his sideline demeanor.\n\"I put a ton of pressure on myself,\" Hoiberg said. \"But there's pressure on everybody who is in this position, whatever level you're coaching. I remember some people told me to not take the Iowa State job because I could only tarnish my reputation in that community. I wouldn't have taken it if I felt we couldn't have some success.\n\"I feel the same about this job. I wouldn't have left Iowa State if I didn't feel we could consistently compete for championships.\n\"This is how I've always been and the type of person I am. I just have a quiet competitiveness. My equipment manager with the Timberwolves joked I would've been a great baseball pitcher because I would've had a few tantrums in the locker room after games. But, yeah, when I'm out on the floor, we're all in it together. And I try to have a calm demeanor for the guys.\"\nThe guys have noticed.\nIt's nearly impossible not to contrast Hoiberg with Thibodeau. Not only because of the difference in their personalities, which is substantial. But because beyond his prodigious winning percentage, Thibodeau's domineering personality cast such a presence over the franchise for five seasons.\nHoiberg is not only calmer, he's more collaborative.\n\"There are days where he just talks and relates to us. That's big,\" Taj Gibson said. \"Sometimes, guys come in a little down. It's good to have a coach that comes to you and says, 'It's all right. Things are going to happen. I've been there.'\"\nHoiberg has cited his playing background for the big-picture approach he took to training camp and will to the season. On the first day of camp, he talked about resting Pau Gasol after his busy summer of international competition. And he said he will consult with players often to gauge where they are mentally and physically.\n\"He really cares about how our body feels,\" Jimmy Butler said.\nHoiberg enters an unusual situation. The Bulls won 50 games last season, lost a competitive series to the Cavaliers and returned virtually intact, swapping Nazr Mohammed for impressive rookie Bobby Portis. The players aren't new. The coach is.\nMost rookie NBA coaches don't inherit such a strong roster.\n\"I have no question he's going to be a high-level NBA coach,\" said Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle, who coached Hoiberg in Indiana. \"He's always had a great intellectual curiosity for the game and a great love and respect for the game. Those are all ingredients for great coaches.\n\"Guys aren't as successful as he's been without having some emotion. But his calm demeanor is a great precursor to having a calm and poised team.\"\nCarlisle coached Hoiberg when he was an assistant to Larry Bird, one of two coaches Hoiberg played for who had never coached at any level. Kevin McHale, another Celtic Hall of Famer, is the other.\n\"I took a lot from Kevin, who was so great at communicating to players,\" Hoiberg said.\nThose associated with Hoiberg at Iowa State say the same. In fact, according to Mike Green, the sports information director, the program has rallied from double-digit deficits in the second half 21 times since 1980. Eight of those 21 times came in the last five seasons under Hoiberg.\n\"If we were ever in a situation where it looked dicey, he never showed any panic,\" Green said. \"He makes you believe you can do it. Even though he wants to win more than anyone I've met, he's not in your face about it. And I think his players really fed off that.\n\"He respected people. He treated them like adults, was a very positive-reinforcement type of coach. He was so even-keeled.\"\nPollard said as he researched candidates to succeed Hoiberg, he talked to college basketball referees, who invariably reflected on Hoiberg's tenure.\n\"Several shared with me that Fred's teams out of timeouts were always more prepared than anyone else's,\" Pollard said.\nAnd that's only a small reason why Pollard knew Hoiberg leaving for the NBA was seemingly inevitable. Befitting Hoiberg, who had several other opportunities to leave over the years, he kept Pollard in the loop, transparent about his teaching goal.\n\"He views the NBA as the smartest minds in the business,\" Pollard said. \"And he wanted to see how he could compete at that level. He wanted the Bulls job because he felt the ownership and management were in place to give him not just a chance to win now but a chance to sustain winning. That mattered more to him than other opportunities with a good roster for now.\"\nHoiberg's opportunity starts for real on Tuesday. He'll be the calm yet competitive one.\nkcjohnson@tribpub.com\nTwitter @kcjhoop\nPrivacy Policy Fred Hoiberg NBA Chicago Bulls Tom Thibodeau Cleveland Cavaliers Rick Carlisle Taj Gibson", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562d33a0/turbine/ct-bulls-bits-gibson-rose-20151025", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562e5855/turbine/ct-fred-hoiberg-bulls-preview-spt-1027-20151026"], "published": "2015-10-26T18:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:13:44.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
