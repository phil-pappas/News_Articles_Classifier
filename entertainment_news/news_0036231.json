(Photo : John Phillips/Getty Images for BFI)   \nSherlock fans, brace yourselves for massive news. \nWe've waited long enough and finally, we can now anchor the Sherlock fan \"feels\" to a date. Entertainment Weekly cites the BBC and PBS Masterpiece announcement on the official return date of the much-anticipated, British drama series Sherlock which is set to officially hit TV screens on January 1, 2016 -- and in a surprising turn of events, both the US and UK can see the well-received BBC Sunday series on the same glorious day. Like Us on Facebook \nThe revelations don't stop there as PBS also released the official air title of the \"Victorian Sherlock Special\" - Sherlock: The Abominable Bride. \nHere's the brand new trailer:It can be recalled that Benedict Cumberbatch (who plays Sherlock) and Martin Freeman (who plays John Watson) helped unveil fresh images from the holiday Sherlock special including a violin-playing Cumberbatch, currently circulating on the internet. While the plot remains a mystery what is public knowledge though is that it will take viewers back to 19 th century, during Christmas time, where Arthur Conan Doyle's original story is set. Moreover, producers confirm that the character of Molly won't be in it as the era was \"unbelievably sexist,\" Metro UK cites. However, Mary will make an appearance as seen on BTS in early 2015. \nThe wait for \"more\" Sherlock has been an agonizing one for fans everywhere as the last season has been aired January 2014. There has also been an initial disparity in air dates for both US and UK territories as the former usually gets the Sherlock episodes at a much later time due to marketing efforts. According to EW though, the \"fan lobbying\" and online piracy has allowed for US fans the pleasure of viewing the shows in almost the same time as the UK. \nThere are more reasons to psyched, however, aside from the upcoming Sherlock Christmas Special. Sherlock producers are reportedly working on a long-awaited fourth season as announced on the BBC network's Twitter page as per Metro UK : \"Series 4 of #Sherlock will start shooting next spring. Steven Moffat and @Markgatiss are busy writing away right now.\" \nHere's the Victorian special official description as per PBS: \n\"Benedict Cumberbatch (The Imitation Game) and Martin Freeman (The Hobbit) return as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson in the acclaimed modern retelling of Arthur Conan Doyle's classic stories. But now our heroes find themselves in 1890s London. Beloved characters Mary Morstan (played by Amanda Abbington), Inspector Lestrade (Rupert Graves) and Mrs. Hudson (Una Stubbs) also turn up at 221b Baker Street.\" Contribute to this Story:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T14:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:02:19.643+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
