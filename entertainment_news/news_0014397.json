That’s how these things normally work. The further a team advances in the playoffs, the more celebs come out to games.\nNobody will accuse Eddie Vedder of being a bandwagon jumper. The Pearl Jam rocker was welcomed with open arms Monday to game 3 – where he was shown sitting next to Cubs president Theo Epstein, who had Vedder perform at his benefit concert in July -- and Tuesday at game 4. Like Vedder, former WWE Champion CM Punk flew to Pittsburgh for Wednesday’s wild-card game against the Pirates. He was also on hand for the games Monday and Tuesday.\n“It’s cool to share it with fans, being at Wrigley, everyone is high-fiving,” said Punk when asked if he preferred to watch high-stakes games at home or in the crowd during an interview Tuesday with 120 Sports .\nSmashing Pumpkins rocker Billy Corgan sat in a suite Monday. John Cusack attends more Cubs games than just about any other celeb and could be seen sitting front row during Tuesday’s broadcast. The Cubs and White Sox fan (yes, they exist) was on hand for games 3 and 4, as were fellow actors Jim Belushi and Joel Murray. Perhaps you saw Murray on the red line heading to Wrigley Tuesday? Noticeably absent during the Cardinals series was his brother, Bill Murray.\nThe games at Wrigley were heavy on former Cubs, including Ryne Sandberg and Kerry Wood, who threw out the ceremonial first pitch before games three and four, respectively, and Billy Williams. Fire star and former Major League Soccer MVP Mike Magee took in both games while the Bears’ Kevin White and Bulls’ Doug McDermott took in Tuesday’s game.\nSo which other famous Cubs fans might we see when the Cubs face the winner of the New York Mets-Los Angeles Dodgers series with a trip to the World Series on the line? The Cubs have a long list of celebrity fans: Actors Vince Vaughn, Nick Offerman, Jeff Garlin, Gary Sinise, Jake Johnson and Ike Barinholtz , NASCAR driver Danica Patrick and rockers Pete Wentz and Tom Morello . You’d think some of them might show up. I’m sure there will be a few new celebrity Cubs fans as well attending games, but not if Johnson has anything to say about it.\nJohn Cusack John J.
