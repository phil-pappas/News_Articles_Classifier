It’s made her proud of what she looks like and is why she posed nude for the cover of her new album, “Revival.”\n“I’ve been working in therapy,” she told the magazine. “Even if I did gain weight, I’m fine. That’s what the picture represents.”\nThis newfound confidence can be seen on Gomez’s Instagram account . The last bathing suit photo she posted featured a caption aimed at critical observers: “I love being happy with me yall.”\nA photo posted by Selena Gomez (@selenagomez) on Apr 16, 2015 at 5:39pm PDT\nIt’s not just the cover where this boost in self-esteem is apparent, it’s clear from the album’s songs as well.\n“Each year, I’m becoming more aware of who I am. I have more self-awareness,” she said. “I feel confident and free. I’m not going to hide in my room and be depressed.”\n“Revival,” which features the hit single “Good for You,” goes on sale this Friday.\nThis article originally appeared in the New York Post 's Page Six .", "external_links": ["http://pagesix.com/tag/selena-gomez/", "http://www.nypost.com/", "https://instagram.com/p/1jmYv8ujDS/", "http://pagesix.com/2015/10/07/body-shaming-sent-selena-gomez-to-therapy/", "http://pagesix.com/", "http://www.usmagazine.com/", "https://instagram.com/selenagomez/"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:20:16.366+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
