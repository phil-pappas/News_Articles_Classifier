A third minute-long commercial, \"The Camera,\" stars Curry.\nIn \"Flip a Coin,\" Foxx is seen debating between two movie scripts and looks to Siri for help. He tells her to flip a coin and she returns tails, leaving Foxx to choose a sci-fi western plot.\nIn \"Crush,\" Foxx is seen in a white dress shirt, looking at himself in a mirror as he puts on a tie. Midway through the process, he asks Siri how she thinks he looks.\n\"Judging from your voice,\" Siri says, \"I'd say you must be fairly attractive.\"\n\"Thanks,\" Foxx replies. \"You got a crush on me?\"\nTechCrunch says these two ads show off the capability of the new iPhone's M9 motion coprocessor, which allows Siri to be permanently active without causing significant battery drain.\nIn the third ad, \"The Camera,\" a narrator teases that not much has changed in the new handset's camera capabilities. However, over the course of the ad, several new features are revealed. These include a 4K video resolution, animated photographs, the screen's ability to function as a flash for selfies, slow-motion video and more. At one point in the ad, NBA star Curry nails a perfect three-point shot.\nApple began sales of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus late September. The company sold over 13 million units in the first weekend of sales.\n  Apple may owe $862M after losing a patent lawsuit Apple deletes hundreds of apps that mine for data", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T12:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T17:20:34.791+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
