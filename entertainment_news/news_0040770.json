This was compared to how frequently the general population visits traditional bars.\nKansas City, MO, October 02, 2015 --( PR.com )-- Arcade bars, sometimes called “barcades,” have been a growing phenomenon. Since 2004, over 100 such establishments have popped up across the United States. A recent RapidPoll asked gamers how frequently they visit such establishments, and compared it to visit frequencies for traditional bars.\nA RapidPolls study of 400 US gamers found that 1/3 of all gamers visit a barcade at least once a year. This is much less than traditional bar visit frequency among the general population, which found that 45% of people visit a bar at least once a year.\nThe study also found:\n* A relatively small percentage -- only 6% of gamers -- visit barcades regularly (at least once a month), compared to 24% of the general population that visit traditional bars at least once a month.\n* Gamers involved in watching, streaming, or competing in eSports are more almost twice as likely to visit a barcade, and are much more likely to visit barcades frequently.\n* Male gamers are more likely to visit a barcade more frequently than female gamers.\nAbout\nRapidPolls is a service from Insights Meta, a full service market research agency serving the video games industry, for conducting microsurveys for the video game industry.
