Culture Minister Monika Gruetters' office confirmed the report but said it couldn't give further details.\nDer Spiegel said the exhibition could contain works that may have been taken by the Nazis from Jewish owners. It quoted Gruetters as saying that, while organizers must show \"respect for the victims,\" she hopes for new clues on the works' origins.\nHer office noted that a 2014 agreement under which Switzerland's Kunstmuseum Bern agreed to accept Gurlitt's bequest of his collection allows for works that were looted, or whose background hasn't been cleared up, to be \"exhibited with the aim of full transparency.\"\nGurlitt died in May 2014, a few months after it emerged that authorities had seized some 1,400 items at his Munich apartment while investigating a tax case in 2012. Officials have been checking whether several hundred of the works were seized from their owners by the Nazis.\nA task force set up to examine the provenance of works in the collection so far has determined that four pieces were looted by the Nazis, and the first two were handed over to their rightful owners' heirs in May.\nThat task force is to wrap up its work at the end of this year. Gruetters wants the government-backed German Lost Art Foundation to take charge of any further research efforts that may be required.\nVisual Arts Humanities Cornelius Gurlitt", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:03:45.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
