During an interview with ShowStudio, Kanye said, “My wife and her family should’ve had plenty of Emmys by now. But reality shows are considered to be like rap was when the Mondrian wouldn’t let Run-D.M.C. and motherf***ing Will Smith stay there because they were rappers. Or the idea of a reality star not being allowed into a fashion show or not being nominated for their show even if it’s the longest running, and the most popular, and everybody I know watches it and s***.” Hollywood Kanye West Emmy awards Kim Kardashian Also Read Miley Cyrus smoke marijuana with Snoop Dogg Steve Martin to receive AFI Life Achievement Award Is trouble brewing in Avril Lavigne’s paradise?
