Martin's fantasy saga \"A Song of Ice and Fire.\" This is the theory of \"Game of Thrones\" star Finn Jones, which he shared during the New York Comic-Con (NYCC) 2015, according to iDigital Times . \nJones told the audience at the NYCC 2015 that he believes a great war will ensue between the \"Ice and Fire\" factions and that both will be annihilated. He also said the war will destroy Westeros, leading them to destroy the Iron Throne, which is made of Valyrian Steel, the report relays. \nThe actor, who plays the role of Loras Tyrell in GoT, said a \"really horrible\" event will happen that will cause the people to start from scratch. \n\"A lot of people will die and out of the ashes will come the tree people and a select few people will grow and give back power to the people,\" the Times quotes Jones' statement during the NYCC 2015. \"'Dream of Spring' will be about regrowth. It'll be Bran, Brienne, Tyrion, just some good guys to bring piece back to the realmâ€¦\" \nWhile Jones' theory about the Iron Throne's fate is still unconfirmed, what is known is that the swords of Brienne of Tarth, Tommen Baratheon, Jon Snow, and Randyll Tarly are also made of Valyrian Steel. The locations of the other swords made of the same material are not stipulated in the books. But it is worth noting that Jones' theory is based on the books and that he is known to always carry a GoT book on the set. \nMeanwhile, Martin's sixth book \"Winds of Winter\" still has no official release date until now. But there are whispers saying the book will be out early next year before GoT season 6 returns on HBO, News Everyday reports. \n\"Game of Thrones\" will come back on air for its sixth season in 2016 on HBO.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T19:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T20:02:20.731+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
