The gunman also died, although it was unclear whether he shot himself or was slain by police responding to the scene. The Anytown massacre, the latest in a string of mass shootings across the nation, stunned the normally bucolic community. “I can’t believe something like this could happen here,” said Anytown Mayor . As the sun set over the town, residents gathered to sing Amazing Grace at a candlelight vigil.\nWitnesses said they heard pop-pop-pop sounds that they initially mistook for firecrackers, balloons or a backfiring vehicle. Then they heard screams from inside the building. “We were lucky to get out alive,” said ____ ____, 18.\nAcquaintances described the gunman as a loner who showed signs of depression, had trouble relating to women and spent many hours playing violent video games. Although he was prone to vicious outbursts, the acquaintances said they didn’t think he’d really do anything, so they didn’t bother to alert authorities. Authorities said they were trying to verify the authenticity of threatening rants the gunman posted on social media sites against blacks/whites/Christians/Muslims/Jews/people.\nAt the White House, a visibly shaken and frustrated President Obama again called on Congress to pass “common sense” gun control measures, such as universal background checks and a ban on assault-style weapons. It was questionable, however, whether any of those measures would have prevented the Anytown shooter from obtaining the guns used in the massacre.\nA spokesman for the NRA said the focus belongs on mental health and, out of respect for the victims, it’s too soon to talk about gun control measures. The spokesman noted that the massacre occurred in a supposedly “gun-free” zone and said that if more people in the school/church/theater/shopping mall had been armed, the gunman could have been stopped.\nAlthough half of the 12 deadliest shootings in U.S. history have occurred since 2007, and the United States leads the world in gun-related homicides, congressional leaders signaled they had no intention of bringing up gun legislation before next year’s election. “If we didn’t do it after Sandy Hook, why would we do it now?” one Republican insider said.\nBack in Anytown, plans were being made to bury the victims and hold memorial services. The rest of the nation turned its attention to a full slate of weekend college and NFL football games.\nBill Sternberg is editor of the editorial page.", "external_links": ["http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/07/24/11-essential-facts-about-guns-and-mass-shootings-in-america/"], "published": "2015-10-02T23:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:59:35.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
