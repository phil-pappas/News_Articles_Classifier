The latest episode of the final season, which debuted in the U.K. in September, delivered a twist that included a bloody scene that is more likely to be seen in a horror or action movie. [SPOILER ALERT!] The latest shocker began with a formal dinner of the Crawleys with the Minister of Health as the Dowager Countess of Grantham, Violet, looked for help to save the local hospital. Then in a quite disturbing scene, Lord Grantham spilled blood, shocking his family members. It turned out that his ulcer burst. As he fell to the floor, he whispered to his wife Cora, \"I have loved you very, very much,\" but she insisted that it's not the end of his life yet. He was taken to the hospital in an ambulance and much to the relief of all the Crawleys and the show's fans, Lord Grantham survived an operation. Also in the same episode, Mary was close to finding out a secret about Edith's illegitimate child. Meanwhile, Edith and her love interest Bertie Pelham met in her London pad and they finally shared a kiss. The sixth and final season of the period drama will not air in the U.S. until on January 3, 2016. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T12:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:50:53.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
