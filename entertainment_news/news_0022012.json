USA TODAY’s picks for book lovers include Joyce Carol Oates' memoir The Lost Landscape , and a new biography of Congressman Jack Kemp.\nThe Lost Landscape: A Writer's Coming of Age by Joyce Carol Oates; Ecco, 368 pp.; non-fiction\nPerhaps the most striking thing about The Lost Landscape , the new collection of autobiographical essays by Joyce Carol Oates, is the 77-year-old author’s discomfort with the notion of memoir. Having published dozens of novels, as well as plays, essays, stories, and poems, Oates now explores the experiences that shaped her as a writer.\nShe was born in Lockport, N.Y., on June 16, 1938. She was close to her parents, Frederic and Carolina, and especially to her maternal grandmother. Her brother, Fred Jr., was born five years later, and a severely autistic sister, Lynn, was born in 1956.\nIn one of the book’s most poignant chapters, “The Lost Sister,” Oates writes about Lynn, who was kept at home until the age of 15, when she physically attacked their “gentle, soft-spoken, and self-effacing” mother and was deemed too dangerous to remain living with her parents.\nShe was sent to a therapeutic facility near Buffalo, which was both a relief and a defeat for the family, as the author recalls. She has thought of Lynn often over the years, but Lynn cannot speak and would not recognize her. She has not seen her sister since 1971.\nUSA TODAY says *** out of four. “A wonderful and deeply personal book, filled with perceptive observations and details.”\nUSA TODAY\nJoyce Carol Oates revisits her childhood\nJack Kemp: The Bleeding Heart Conservative Who Changed America by Morton Kondracke and Fred Barnes; Sentinel, 390 pp.; non-fiction\nJournalists Kondracke and Barnes describe the late Kemp as \"the most important politician of the twentieth century who was not president, certainly the most influential Republican.\"\nUSA TODAY says ***.
