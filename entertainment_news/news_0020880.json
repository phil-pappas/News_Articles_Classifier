Instead, writer Noah Hawley and a handful of directors did a remarkable job recreating the original’s weird mix of quiet drama and deadpan comedy.\nMartin Freeman plays Lester Nygaard, a nebbish bullied by both his wife and a longtime “friend.” Lester’s life is changed by a chance encounter with the itinerant hitman Lorne Malvo (Billy Bob Thornton), an eccentric sociopath who takes Lester under his wing. Malvo helps Lester deal with his problems – in an extremely direct and effective manner.\nThe challenge of unraveling what Lester and Malvo have done falls to two police officers from different towns: a capable young woman played by Allison Tolman and a skittish single dad played by Colin Hanks. Together, they find the courage to face a malevolence neither could handle alone.\nThat story winds through myriad complications and introduces a dozen or so memorable side characters through 10 episodes. Among the notable performances are Kate Walsh as a not-very-grieving widow and Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele as a pair of incompetent FBI agents.\nAs in the movie, Fargo looms as a metaphor for the evil that lurks just across the border of our quiet, well-tended lives.\n“FARGO” \nOriginal run: April-June 2014 on FX\nStarred: Martin Freeman, Billy Bob Thornton, Allison Tolman, Colin Hanks\nBinge commitment: 10 one-hour episodes\nRating: TV-MA\nWatch it: Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, others\nAD OUT \nHow much is it worth to eliminate ads from your streaming experience?
