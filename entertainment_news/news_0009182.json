Nathan Frandino reports.   \nSouth of the border... Mexican comedians are hitting back at Donald Trump. A new play is taking aim at the Republican frontrunner over his anti-Mexican comments on the U.S. election campaign trail. It's called \"Sons of Trump.\" For 80 minutes, several comedians portray the controversial billionaire as a caricature of the Ugly American. So far Trump has thundered against Mexico, dismissing its migrants to the U.S. as rapists and drug runners. One audience member says he's happy to see the tables turned. (SOUNDBITE) (Spanish) COMIC, GUSTAVO MUNGUIA, WHO IS A GUEST AT THE PREMIERE OF THE PLAY, SAYING: \"He has to realize, he alone has to realize that he is nothing more than a fool who talks just to talk and for having that racist attitude that pollutes and can pollute others.\" Others were less impressed with the adaptation. (SOUNDBITE) (Spanish) SPECTATOR, LOURDES GALINDO, SAYING: \"Really disappointing and I feel totally cheated because all the publicity was related to something else, they spoke about a satire and this is not a satire, this is something completely different.\" The show is booked for a six-week run in Mexico City. Its crew then hopes to hit the campaign trail for shows in Los Angeles and Chicago.  //reut.rs/1Z5nAtL", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T02:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T10:49:38.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
