Talk to anyone who lives in or has visited Pennsylvania's easternmost city and they'll tell you there's a vibe, an energy to the city's arts scene that attracts not only regional residents but people from New Jersey and New York as well.\nFor 25 years Easton...\n(Tim Higgins) The 3-year-old shop, selling exactly what its name implies, is co-owned by Gary Ringhoff and Michael Holford, who also operate The Strand Salon & Boutique next door.\nVintage lamps, vases and other items are scattered among newer items, including handcrafted jewelry and soaps.\n\"Our clientele ranges from college students to people with well-established homes,\" said store manager Laurie Oxford. \"And one thing everyone comments on is how reasonable we are.\"\nOxford, who previously co-owned the former Abode Fine Furnishings & Antiques in Bethlehem, selects and designs merchandise. She does most of the buying, but welcomes individuals looking to sell their own goods to call the shop with inquiries.\nBig sellers include furniture and home decor, she said, with recent pieces ranging from a reupholstered French rococo-style bergere chair and a custom upholstered mid-century club chair to salvaged doors with Victorian detail and a crystal-adorned fireplace candelabra.\nVintage prints such as Van Gogh's \"Sunflowers\" and Matisse's \"Goldfish\" also sell quickly, Oxford said, along with \"grab-and-go items\" such as dishes and pottery in a small side room.\n\"In the window, we have a $1,200 Ernest Masi coffee table paired with a $35 vintage lamp,\" Oxford said. \"We really have something for everyone.\"\n• As Is: Mostly Old Stuff , 431 Northampton St., 610-417-4321\nEaston Antique Co-Op\nWhen it comes to Easton antique shops, the new kid on the block, Easton Antique Co-Op, is quickly making a name for itself.\nThe store, which opened Aug. 15 in the space that previously housed Julies Emporium–Antiques on the Square, sells vintage and modern pieces from owner Randy Bentley, along with an eclectic mix of antiques from more than a dozen additional dealers.\nBentley, who previously ran his Apsara Gallery out of Lambertville, N.J., has traveled the world for more than 35 years, collecting rare items in the process. Among the available pieces are textiles, acacia lacquered furniture, antique Burmese nat (spirit) statues and large Thai horse sculptures made from driftwood and teak.\nIn the shop's second floor mezzanine, he carries more than 150 antique Oriental rugs, which are imported from Asian and Middle Eastern countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran. Antique rug cleaning and repair also are offered.\n\"There are lots of restaurants opening in Easton and that's great, but people need other cultural things to do before they eat,\" Bentley said. He plans to open a second 32-dealer antique shop, Easton Emporium, by early November in the 20 S. Third St. space that previously housed antique shop Carrie Anne's.\nMerchandise from other Easton Antique Co-Op dealers ranges from books, electronics, furniture and lamps to jewelry, paintings, signs and tableware.\nStandout items include 17th, 18th and 19th century British antique furniture (James Curran Antiques); a Bethlehem Steel binder, Olympia typewriter, Westinghouse record player and rare books, including a first edition of \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" (Bethlehem Antiques); and vintage glassware, urns, vases and Asian decor (Lucy's Treasures).\n• Easton Antique Co-Op , 60 Centre Square, 610-829-1555, facebook.com/eastonantiquecoop\nIngridable Design\nDiscover the imaginative creations of artist/designer Ingrid Heil when you step inside her quaint shop, Ingridable Design.\nYou'll find everything from handmade bags, pottery and funky jewelry to vibrant paintings, sculptures and repurposed furniture inside the store, whose tag line reads \"where ingenuity never stops.\"\n\"I love anything that has to do with creativity,\" said Heil, who traces her passion for designing back to age 5 when she would redecorate her grandmother's house in Germany.\nThe 3-year-old shop, whose brick archways and shingled overhangs evoke a village-like feel, sells an eclectic mix of goods — from old clocks and mirrors to American flags and picture frames.\nHeil, who also does home staging, interior decorating and custom window treatments, makes or repurposes about 70 percent of the business' merchandise — from pillows and throws to change purses and scarves. She's currently repainting an old Victorian cabinet.\n\"Where others might see damaged goods, I see potential for new life,\" said Heil, pointing to a coffee table-turned bench, $595, that she labels \"unique and still cheaper than what you'd pay at a larger store.\"\nAll of the merchandise sells well, she said, except for the furniture, which sits a bit longer.\n\"People, especially teens and 20-somethings, seem to prefer modern styles — the Pottery Barn-style sofas if you will,\" Heil said while sitting in a Victorian chair priced at $1,800. \"I'm hoping this changes and they start to realize that with antiques, you get better-made pieces with more character and history.\"\nHeil, who previously sold items at Black Rose Antiques & Collectibles at the South Mall in Salisbury Township and the former Julies Emporium–Antiques on the Square in Easton, said painting and pottery are her favorite parts of the business.\nHer parents never supported her creative endeavors, but she pushed forward anyway, honing the trades while living in Germany, South Africa and the United States.\n\"I'm doing what I love, and that's all that matters,\" she said.\n• Ingridable Design , 60 N. Second St., 610-515-1454, ingridabledesign.biz\nSalvage Goods\nThe slogan of Salvage Goods sums it up quite perfectly: \"Antiques with Urban Attitude.\"\nThe 5-year-old shop, co-owned by husband and wife Robert Collins and Nancy Esposito, carries a carefully curated collection of antique, vintage, industrial, repurposed and architectural pieces for the home and garden.\nFrom vintage cameras, clocks, clothing and candelabras to decorative cast-iron items and tables made out of barn wood, industrial steel and wagon wheels, there is an eclectic mix of old and reimagined inventory.\nEsposito, who previously ran an antique shop in Clinton, N.J., designs all of the repurposed items. A trio of craftsmen helps her construct them.\n\"We're definitely not your grandmother's antique shop,\" she said. \"I love making something new out of something old; it never gets old.\"\nEsposito is selective with what she sells, offering merchandise that is \"truly unique or rare.\" About 85 percent is locally sourced, she said.\n\"I really have to edit or I'd simply have too much,\" she said. \"The quality as well as the affordability help the items to not sit around long. We have a good turnover rate, with new inventory coming in weekly.\"\nEye-catching pieces such as an Underwood typewriter and industrial sewing machine base are displayed alongside rare books, dating as far as the early 1800s, and antique toys such as dolls, cap guns and miniature cars.\nPopular items range from vintage fabric, fedoras and frames to jewelry, kitchen utensils and letter type.\nAnything Bethlehem Steel-related — from old bolts and helmets to welfare baskets and plant photos — \"really flies off the shelves,\" said Esposito, noting the store also occasionally obtains memorabilia from other former area businesses, including Wilson's Dixie Cup plant.\nOn the shop's rear patio, customers can browse additional merchandise, including old buckets, doors, fencing, planters, window shutters and wooden beams.\nFor those looking for a couple of modern accents, Salvage Goods also sells locally made artwork and lamp shades.\n• Salvage Goods , 24 S. Third St., 610-258-8176, salvagehomegoods.com\nUsed Grooves\nWhether you're hunting for an out-of-print record or a cherished single from your past, Used Grooves may well have the sounds you're searching for.\nThe 2-year-old shop carries about 30,000 vinyl records of varying genres and sub genres — from classical, country, metal and funk and soul to hip-hop, jazz, Latin and punk rock.\nSelections — ranging from obscure acts to music legends such as Frank Sinatra, Louis Armstrong and The Supremes — are housed in nearly a dozen two-tiered display cases. They are organized by genre and then alphabetized by artist name.\nOn the walls, new arrivals from No More, Tamikrest and other bands are displayed alongside prominent picks from the past, including those from Bob Dylan, Elvis Presley and Led Zeppelin. There are also signed or rare posters of Kiss, The Smashing Pumpkins and other groups.\nAn illuminated DJ station in the back spins whatever tunes the workers are feeling that day.\n\"Vinyl makes us human,\" said manager Brad Scott Smith, noting most new releases now come with digital downloads. \"The gatefolds often come with extra pictures, stories about the band and lyric sheets — making for a much more complete experience. You can't get intimate like that with an MP3.\"\nSmith labels classic rock albums from the 1960s through the 1980s as the biggest sellers with other popular selections coming from the hip-hop, jazz and electronic sections.\n\"A lot of DJs, myself included, shop here because we have a great electro section,\" said Smith, who regularly spins music at city bars Drinky's and Two Rivers Brewing Co.\n\"New used albums,\" arriving daily, typically cost between $3 and $10, with first pressings and other rarer finds costing more.\n\"We had a limited edition Velvet Underground & Nico album, featuring the artwork of Andy Warhol and a peel-off banana, that sold for $250,\" he adds.\nThe 1,100-square-foot store, which discontinued its sale of CDs due to poor sales, has a huge Internet presence, with about 60 percent of sales occurring online, Smith said. It also sells stereo equipment.\n• Used Grooves , 401 Northampton St., 610-252-8282, usedgrooves.com\nryan.kneller@mcall.com\n610-820-6597", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562afed5/turbine/mc-insiders-easton-art-karl-stirner-galleries-20151024"], "published": "2015-10-24T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:34:50.984+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
