They’ve built the most extraordinary set: a block and a half of New York in the 1920s. It’s gorgeous. Trams and everything.\"\nFans will know that the central character in Fantastic Beasts, Newt Scamander, spends a certain amount of time in New York. This, too, was confirmed by JK Rowling on Twitter so that's one aspect covered. The time period, however, is interesting.\nUp until now, nobody was exactly sure when the film was set or how Farrell fits into the story. Judging by his comments in said interview, Farrell's going to play a key role in the film as he'll be on set until January.\nSo, what are we thinking so far? 1920's wizardry means it's entirely possibly we'll see a young Dumbledore and Tom Riddle, Sr., although there's been no confirmation on either of that so far.\nWhat do you think?
