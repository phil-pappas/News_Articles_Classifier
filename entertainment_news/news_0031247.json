She was murdered by a trio of sassy witches in the last 1600s and, you know, has been dead and ghostly ever since. But looking at the actress who played Emily Binx, well, that's a lot more complicated. You might even say there's some hocus pocus happening, if you like a bad pun ( witch which I do). So come little children, I'll take you away, into a world of enchantment and IMDB credit confusion...\n Emily Binx is listed on IMDB as being played by Jodie-Amy Rivera, as shown in the screengrab below:\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail Via IMDB More From Cosmopolitan And this is a fact repeated on many a Hocus Pocus fun fact feature — here's a Crushable \" Remember Emily Binx ?\" piece, a Popcrush \" What Are The Cast of Hocus Pocus Up To Now? \" round-up, and a BuzzFeed \" 38 Things You Didn't Know About Hocus Pocus \" listicle (it's thing no. 24), for example. Jodie-Amy is/was a famous YouTuber, one of the first big players on the video platform — and part of the first group of vloggers to work with Google's ad revenue platform — producing her content under the name Venetian Princess. It's a compelling then/now photo composite in terms of her and lil' Emily Binx, because Jodie-Amy looked like this at the time/in a lot of her videos:\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail Emily Binx in Hocus Pocus; Jodie-Amy Rivera One problem, though: Jodie-Amy Rivera didn't play Emily Binx. It's all one big mix-up that's never really been corrected, until now at least (to Jodie-Amy's relief). \"I used to do a lot of radio shows,\" Jodie-Amy explained in an interview with Cosmopolitan.com, \"and [during one interview] they asked me if I had been in any films. When I was a kid, my mom had me doing commercials and extra work, so I said I was in Hocus Pocus and [the DJ] then went on to something else, so I didn't get to say I had a very small part.\"\n\"After that I remember people saying, 'Oh, you're Emily Binx,'\" she continued, \"and I'd be like, 'No, I'm not!' It was funny, but not really, because I was on Facebook and I'd see these articles from like BuzzFeed and I'd see my face and it says, 'Where are they now?' but they'd got it all wrong.\" Nobody had ever reached out to confirm her role with her, she added, or paid much attention to her attempts to explain. She's even contacted IMDB to try and get them to correct the listing, but that didn't work.\nJodie-Amy actually played one of the modern-day children caught up in Sarah Jessica Parker's witchy \"Come Little Children\" spell . \"If you Google the trailer you can see me perfectly clear,\" she explained. \"The whole concept the director had was that we're half in our pajamas, half in our Halloween costumes [because we'd come back home to sleep after trick-or-treating], so I was in pajamas and then I had a bridal veil on.\"\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail Jodie-Amy on the far right, in the foreground. Jodie-Amy filmed her scenes in Salem, Massachusetts, where Hocus Pocus is technically set, but most of the principle filming took place in Los Angeles. Because of this, she didn't even get to meet the primary cast, or the real Emily Binx. On her being credited as this character incorrectly, Jodie-Amy added that \"I was crushed, I felt so bad for the girl who really played Emily ... and I was worried that she thought I lied about it or something.\"\n\"So I got a hold of her and talked to her on the phone the other day, because every Halloween, this becomes a thing again,\" Jodie-Amy continued. \"I explained to her what happened, and she was so understanding and very kind. She said, 'Don't worry about it, it was so long ago, I really don't care.'\"\nYes, she tracked down the real Emily Binx herself. ​IMDB's page does credit Emily Binx as Jodie-Amy Rivera under the \"stage name\" Amanda Shepherd — as that's never a stage name Jodie-Amy used herself, that proved a solid Google starting point. It turns out the real Emily, or Amanda, a child star with hundreds of commercial credits and who almost beat out Kirsten Dunst for that role in '90s vampire film Interview With a Vampire , is now a real estate agent working in Malibu, California, among other fascinating passions.
