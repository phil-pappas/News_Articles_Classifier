The 54 overhead bins aboard each seat have a unique decal inspired by the film.\nThe painting took place in Fort Worth, Texas, after all members of the project watched the movie to get \"into the spirit.\" The job took 21 days, with employees working 12-hour shifts and a crew of six painters working around the clock. Some 634.5 liters of paint were used to produce 23 colors, in addition to sparkles that will shine when the aircraft moves.\nThe plane, registered as C-GWSV with tail number 810, is equipped with the company's new WestJet Connect system, which will provide passengers with a selection of Disney videos on demand.\nIn December 2013, the company produced a custom painted Boeing 737 with Sorcerer Mickey on the tail.\n  Pixar releases clip from short film 'Sanjay's Super Team' Disney XD renews 'Guardians of the Galaxy' for Season 2 Hugh Jackman, Rooney Mara and Joe Wright re-invent Peter 'Pan' tale for a new generation", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T15:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:08:47.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
