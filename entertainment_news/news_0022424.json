In the other, Destroyer (a.k.a. Dan Bejar). \nBoth artists play in town this week. Both have devoted fans. But if you were a devotee of both artist’s art, how would you decide which show to attend? \nIn this new feature, we pit the two acts against each other in the ring of journalistic opinion and figure out the odds-on winner. \n(And if neither of these artists does it for you, the amazing Detroit group Death and the amusingly named Guantanamo Baywatch play the Venue, Oct. 17). \nMadonna Rebel Heart Tour \nWhen: Wednesday, Oct. 14, 8 p.m. \nTickets: $40-505+ \nBorn: Aug. 16, 1958 in Bay City, Mich. \nYears active: 1979-present \nGenre: Pick one \n1. Career: 300 million+ sales. Guinness Book of World Records acknowledges her as best-selling female recording act and fourth best-selling artist of all time. \n20 MTV Video Music Awards (more than any other artist), 12 No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 songs, eight No. 1 Billboard 200 albums. \n2. Most recent record: Rebel Heart (Interscope Records) includes contributions from Diplo, Avicii and Kanye West. Rebel Heart Metascore at Metacritic.com: 68 \n3. Number of dates played on tour: Vancouver is No. 12 (five shows were postponed for extra production prep time). \n4. What the critics are saying: “Consisting of four loosely thematic sections broken up by costume changes, with almost every song benefiting from its own tailor-made staging and with a small army of dancers gracefully executing intense choreography, the show hit all the marks. \n“Those included the expected provocation. Anyone hoping Madonna would smash new taboos would have left disappointed; but then, she’s already shattered most of them. Still, the first segment’s slightly confused rebellion was built on a load-bearing mash-up of familiar themes: sex, salvation, religion, oppression. \n“The introductory film positioned the star as both outsider and leader, with images of Madonna — and, why not, Mike Tyson — in captivity, and talk of ‘too much creativity being crushed beneath the wheel of corporate branding … It’s time to wake up.’ Ignoring the fact that Madonna long ago became a corporate brand unto herself, it was thrilling to see her descend from the rafters and break out of her cage. With a battalion of armoured warriors falling under her command, Iconic was insanely theatrical, Broadway-worthy, and just the beginning.” \n— Jordan Zivitz, Montreal Gazette \nDestroyer Poison Season Tour \nWhen: Saturday, Oct. 17, 8:30 p.m. \nTickets: $23.50 at Ticketmaster, Livenation.com , Red Cat Records \nDan Bejar \nBorn: Oct. 4, 1972 in Vancouver \nYears active: 1996-present \nGenre: Orchestral rock, indie pop \n1. Career: 10 albums. Spin.com named 2011’s Kaputt one of the 300 Best Albums of the Past 30 Years. It reached 62 on the Billboard charts. \n2. Most recent record: Poison Season (Merge) was released on Sept. 19,2015 and reached 118 on the Billboard 200. Metascore of 86 on Metacritic.com. \n3. Number of dates played on tour: Vancouver is No. 10 (From there the group heads to the Pitchfork Festival in France and then tours Europe through November). \n4. Writing for Consequence of Sound (consequenceofsound.net), Philip Cosores said that the sold-out show at L.A.’s Regent Theater noted: “Though the band around him has grown, Bejar as a performer has long been disinclined to leave his shell. A first-time observer at Sunday night’s nearly sold-out set at downtown L.A.’s Regent Theater might focus on the fact he kneels down on the stage during any musical interlude, that his eyes mostly remain shut or focused on the ground, that he is more comfortable facing away from the stage than he is looking at his audience. For those who have seen Destroyer play over the years, it’s impressive just how much better Bejar has gotten.” \nThe Decision: Madonna is the heavy hitter here, no question. But postponed dates and an 18-point spread in aggregated reviews for new music suggest there might be more focus on spectacle than content. Granted, that might be the point. Destroyer, on the other hand, appears to be hitting a career-high over the past two albums and boasts a crack backing band of some of Vancouver’s very finest players including trumpeter JP Carter. He won’t be making any grand artistic statements with an opening movie and may be one of the least strutting performers around. In the end, would you rather watch a gazillionaire stroke their ego or an acclaimed singer/songwriter close his eyes and stroke his beard? I favour the beard. \n— Stuart Derdeyn", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:46:14.586+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
