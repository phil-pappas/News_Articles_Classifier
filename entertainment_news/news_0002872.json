Dumaplin\nOctober 14, 2015 Many OTWOListas (“On The Wings Of Love” fans) are annoyed with Jigs (Albie Casiño), the antagonist in the love story of Clark (James Reid) and Leah (Nadine Lustre). In fact, Jigs is now considered the “Pambansang Bully.”\nAlbie Casiño: ‘(I promise) mas maiinis po kayo sa akin’\nAlbie doesn’t mind the “title,” believing it is proof of his effectiveness as actor. “Salamat po sa mga nagagalit sa akin,” he quipped with a smile, adding tongue-in-cheek later in the interview. “(I promise) mas maiinis po kayo sa akin.”\nAs “OTWOL” gains ground, consistently trending worldwide on Twitter, its avid viewers have become divided between the two male characters. It didn’t help that a few episodes ago, Jigs and Clark showed off their hot bods to Leah in some face off of sorts. That episode sent viewers on a high. It is said that Albie has even gotten several JaDine fans on his side online. “Hindi nila ako bina-bash (kundi) ipinagtatanggol nila ako,” Albie said proudly.\nHe’s been waiting for this moment in his career. If before, people focused on his controversial personal life, now it’s all about the work. “Ang saya ko po ngayon,” Albie said. “Sobrang overwhelmed.”\nHe enjoys working with JaDine and it shows on their onscreen chemistry. Albie doesn’t bat an eyelash in saying, “Ang ganda po ng palabas namin” partly because “everyone (in the cast and crew) is having fun and putting (in) their best effort.”\nAlbie is motivated to do good particularly when he does scenes with awarded actress Cherry Pie Picache, who plays his mother Jacqueline (or Tita Jack) in the series. “Gusto ko po talaga na dalhin ’yung A game ko. Ayoko pong mapahiya ko ’yung sarili ko ’pag kasama ko po si Ms. Pie. (It) tends to bring out the best in me po,” he said.\nAlbie thinks Jigs is not all-out bad guy.\n“Kulang lang siya sa pagmamahal kasi hindi niya naramdaman ’yung pagmamahal ng mom niya, wala siyang tatay, tapos iniwan pa siya ni Leah…”\nIntimidating but insecure inside. Well, it does have its appeal… (With report from Jojo P.
