(Also Read: Quota stir leader Hardik Patel booked for sedition) \nA case of sedition was filed against Hardik for his alleged controversial remarks instigating his community youth to kill cops instead of committing suicide.Hardik, who was detained by Rajkot rural police ahead of the India-South Africa One-Day International on Sunday as he had threatened to disrupt the match, was arrested yesterday by the Rajkot rural police for allegedly insulting the national flag.Just after he was granted bail last evening by a local court in the flag case, Surat police had arrested him in the sedition complaint which was filed in that city. \nSurat city DCP Makrand Chauhan had filed a complaint against Hardik in Amroli police station for advising a Patel youth to kill policemen.The sedition case was filed under section 124(A) of IPC at Amroli Police Station in Surat under which any accused, if convicted, can be sentenced to maximum of life imprisonment, while the minimum sentence is of three years.The section reads, “whoever, by words, either spoken or written..Brings hatred or contempt, or excites disaffection towards the Government shall be punishable with imprisonment for life…Or with minimum imprisonment up to three years.” \nOther IPC sections included in the FIR against Hardik are section 115 (Abetment of offence), 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups, 505-2 (incite one community against another) and 506 (criminal intimidation).The 22-year-old emerging Patel leader had on October 3 allegedly advised a Surat-based youth from his community to kill cops rather than ending his life. \n“If you have so much courage…Then go and kill a couple of policemen. Patels never commit suicide,” Hardik had allegedly told the youth Vipul Desai, who had announced that he would commit suicide in support of the agitation.Hardik had visited Desai’s house accompanied by a team of a news channel which had aired the conversation later.The quota stir leader has been hogging the limelight since the August 25 “mega-rally” of Patels in Ahmedabad and the subsequent violence across Gujarat in which 10 people were killed. \n  4:03 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T13:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:11:00.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
