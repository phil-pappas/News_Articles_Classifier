Their arrival supposedly signals the beginning of winter.\nThe first bird of the year arrived yesterday, 25 days earlier than last year, and is the earliest they've arrived since 1963, leading many to believe we're all set for a nightmare of a season ahead.\nSpeaking to the Daily Telegraph, Slimbridge swan expert Julia Newth said \"apparently there's a Russian saying that 'the swan brings snow on its bill', because they tend to move just ahead of the cold weather.\n\"Of course, we can't infer much from the arrival of a single swan but it's certainly exciting this bird has arrived so early.\n\"It's only a year old and, because it's made it all the way here on its own, we assume that it must have come to Slimbridge last year as a cygnet with its parents.\nSo we're basically all hoping that this bird is an idiot, or else just scared by the tiniest bit of cold, or else we're all screwed for the winter.\nWe'd also like to point out that El Nino is happening in the tropical Pacific, which means warmer waters are creating extreme weather conditions. Plus, Met Eireann has predicted frost around the country this week, so you know, buy a warm jacket.\nVia Irish Independent\nMORE: Orange weather warning set to ruin all of our weekends\nMORE: Pics: Spectacular shots of the Northern Lights over Ireland last night as we align with the sun\nMORE: Pic: Woman alleges there was a 'maggot' inside her chips at McDonald's", "external_links": ["http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/is-ireland-heading-for-its-longest-winter-in-50-years-31604910.html"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T15:49:38.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
