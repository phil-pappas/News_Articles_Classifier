Blige, Alanis Morissette, Beck, St. Vincent, Selena Gomez, Justin Timberlake, Avril Lavigne, Steven Tyler and Mick Jagger among them - so guessing who’d she be dragging onto stage every night is half the fun. \nUrban appeared towards the end of the show to perform his latest country hit, John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16, alongside Swift plus older song, I Wanna Love Somebody Like You. \nOpening were Pickering, Ontario’s own 17-year-old rising pop star Shawn Mendes and Australia’s Vance Joy. \n“What’s up Toronto? I’m happy to be home!” said Mendes, dressed plainly in a black T-shirt and jeans and just accompanying himself on acoustic guitar. \nHis first song I Don’t Even Know Your Name didn’t exactly set the place on fire but more than a few people recognized his breakthough song, Life of the Party, and the crowd finally started singing along to Something Big and Stitches. \nJoy was also an acoustic guitar strummer but at least he had a backing band even if his cover of Sam Smith’s Stay With Me fell really flat. \nLive coverage recap", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T07:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:42:47.549+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
