I am planning to take a semester abroad at the beginning of my junior year. Recently, Evan confessed that if I leave, our relationship would have to end. He asserts that being away from me for more than three months would be too painful and scary. (He has some anxiety issues, for which I have urged him to consider therapy.) Should I end this relationship now, or continue to see if Evan changes his mind? There’s a possibility that I may not even be able to go. I don’t want to break any hearts or inflict any pain. Evan is my best friend, and I’m scared of losing him.\nAmbitious Student in Maryland \nDear Student: Tell Evan that you love him and want him to be your best friend forever but that the semester abroad is an opportunity to grow. Your absence will provide Evan with one, too. You are right that he needs to work on his anxiety issues. It would be a huge mistake to let them stand in the way of your having the experience of a lifetime if you are lucky enough to get it. \nDear Abby: I am 50, own my home and am debt free. I have friends but have never dated anyone. My problem is, four years ago I lost my job. I have a few investments and a small inheritance that, when combined, give me an income of $60,000 a year. So I don’t need more money. Although I did look for another job for two years, I haven’t tried for the past two. I tell my friends I’ve decided to retire. They keep telling me I need to find a job because I need something to keep me busy. Friends have started telling me I may have a “problem” and should think about counseling. I see no need for it, but have decided to get an outside opinion. \nOut of Work in Texas \nDear Out of Work: There are reasons people work besides the financial one. Social stimulation is important, too. I am glad you have the money to support yourself, but what if something unplanned or catastrophic happens in the future that jeopardizes your nest egg? Fifty is young to “retire.” The counseling you’re considering should be used to determine why you lack the motivation to continue being a contributing member of society.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T10:20:01.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
