The Midcoast group features Nancy Jones (vocals, guitar, penny whistle and fiddle), Cindy Millar (vocals, mandolin and fiddle), Brian Dunn (vocals and mandolin), Chuck McGregor (bass) and Dick White (guitar). \nThe lynchpin of the evolving is Alex Calabrese’s writing, and the guitarist and vocalist performs solo except when in Boston, when he pairs up with Galen Fraser. The musicians met a couple of years ago, when Calabrese had a solo residency at The Lansdowne Pub, across the street from Fenway Park. They are joined on Neversink’s debut CD by drummer Scott Burn of Scotland. They await the anticipated release of their debut record, “Born of Words.” \nRock City’s menu is available until closing. For more information on this and other events happening at the coffeebar/cafe, call 594-4123 or find it on Facebook. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
