I happen to fall in the latter category, though I'll admit there are admirable things about it. For example, it's occasionally a very beautiful film. It's uncompromising in its gaudy, R-rated vision. The opening credits scene is cool and creative and fun. The special effects are great.But the film, as a whole, is just really dumb. There are so many things about the source material that Snyder clearly doesn't get, from its very premise (superheroes in the real world means no Matrix fight scenes, man) to its ending (people like to make fun of nerds for decrying the lack of a \"squid,\" but without it, that scene isn't nearly as visceral, interesting, or grim). Alan Moore's Watchmen was known for deconstructing superhero comics on a fundamental level; Zack Snyder's Watchmen threw nipples on Nite Owl's supersuit and called it a day. And that's all on top of the film's wildly inconsistent tone, never more evident than during the sex scene set to Leonard Cohen's \"Hallelujah.\"[caption id=\"attachment_586\" align=\"\" width=\"1200\"] Image Credit: Warner Bros.[/caption]So it is with some trepidation that I relay to you the news that Zack Snyder is in talks with HBO to make a Watchmen television show.This news comes courtesy of Collider's Dave Trumbore (since confirmed by HBO), who says that \" meetings about adapting the DC Comics property have taken place ,\" though there are currently no details as to whether it will be \" a prequel series, a re-imagining of the events of the ' Watchmen' story itself, or a sequel series. \" On the one hand, there's no doubt that Watchmen is a story best suited to a long-form live-action adaptation, like a miniseries or a TV show. People have been saying this for years now, though the ability to do such a series justice - in terms of production values if nothing else - has only recently become a reality (see: Game of Thrones ). On the other hand, it seems very unlikely that HBO would be interested in merely adapting the same story that was turned into a movie just six years ago - a movie that received mixed reviews (65% on Rotten Toamtoes) and was a big letdown at the box office ($185 million worldwide against a $130 million production budget).Which leads us to the prevailing theory as to what this TV show would be: A Watchmen prequel, at least to start. A few years back, DC Comics sold the last shred of their respectability by producing a series of Watchmen prequels called Before Watchmen , a move that creator Alan Moore was vehemently opposed to (in fairness, he's vehemently opposed to everything these days). With all the money that DC put into the project, they were able to bring on some truly great talent, including Darwyn Cooke, Brian Azzarello, Amanda Conner, and Jae Lee. And yet, despite that, the comics themselves received a decidedly mixed reception (at best), and sold well below expectations. Suffice it to say, nobody much wanted to see what Rorschach and The Comedian were doing in detail before the events of Watchmen . The original series showed us all we needed to know, and Before Watchmen just mucked that all up with retcons and worse.But with Game of Thrones on the way out (there are probably three more seasons left), might HBO throw caution to the wind in an attempt to find a flagship replacement? Might they adapt these stupid Watchmen prequels as a lead up to a straight-up Watchmen re-adaptation? Anything's possible. Or, in the words of Doc Manhattan, \"Nothing ever ends.\" I'm pretty sure he was talking about Hollywood's perpetual reboot/remake/reimagining machine.", "external_links": ["http://collider.com/watchmen-tv-series-hbo-zack-snyder/"], "published": "2015-10-02T12:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:26:02.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
