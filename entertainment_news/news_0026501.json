San Jose-based Fry’s Electronics has bowed out as sponsor for the event after this year. Photo by Steve Dykes/Getty Images It was a big finish and a dramatic sendoff for the final Frys.com Open at Silverado Resort and Spa in Napa today. Argentinean PGA Tour rookie Emiliano Grillo held on in the final round on Sunday, October 18, ended up in a playoff against a hard-charging Kevin Na , and notched up his first win in his first PGA Tour event.\nGrillo, who hoisted the trophy at the Web.com Tour Championship at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida two weeks ago, was part of the conversation all day today on Silverado’s tight, strategic North Course. A pair of bogeys on the back nine, on the par-5 12th and par-3 15th – the result of too-aggressive plays after tightly tucked hole locations – came close to derailing his run for the win.\nNa, a 15-year veteran who was hungry for his second win in 300 events, put his foot down in the closing third of todays round, making birdies on four of the last six holes, climaxing with a clutch birdie putt at the 18th, to catch Grillo and force a playoff.\nBoth players parred the first playoff hole – the par-5 18th, but a miscue by Na on the second time through, on #18 again, put paid to his run. Hitting driver off the deck – which he had been doing with some success all week, Na pulled his second shot into poor position off the fairway – behind a tree, actually – and couldn’t keepo his third shot on the green. After Na made bogey on the hole, Grillo had two putts for his first win on the PGA Tour – in his rookie debut, no less.\nAmong the perks attendant upon a win on the PGA Tour is entry into the Masters Tournament at Augusta National in April. Asked in his post-round interview what this win means to him, Grillo replied, “Yeah, (it) means everything. They said the word “Masters” twice today. You see this? ( pointing to his wide grin ) That is what I’m going to do ever single time you say “Masters. Its unbelievable.”\nA number of other contenders for the final Frys.com trophy faded down the stretch, including 18-, 36- and 54-hole leader Brendan Steele, and 2012 U.S. Open champion Justin Rose, the second-highest-ranked player in the field at #7 in the OWGR. Rose, after going out in 2-under 34, staggered in at the end with three bogeys on the back side, two of then coming in the last four holes. After rounds of 67, 69, and 68, his final round 72 left him three strokes back of the co-leaders, settling for a T-6 finish that is more distant than it sounds.\nSteele leapt out of the starting gate in Thursday’s first round with a scorching 63, and held onto the lead through 54 holes with rounds of 70 and 69. He had clearly shot his bolt by the time that today’s final round came about, though, as carded an even-par front nine that was only thanks to a hole-out eagle from the right rough on the par-5 fifth hole which offset two of his three bogeys. The final stretch of the round was his downfall, as he missed greens and missed putts on the way to five bogeys from the twelfth hole in. His final-round 76 dropped him 16 spots on the leaderboard – a disappointing finish when just parring in from #12 would have put him in the eventual playoff.\nAmong NorCal-connected players, Mark Hubbard, a 2011 San Jose State grad, topped the list with a T-30 finish, moving up 9 spots on Sunday thanks to a 2-under-par final-round 70. Alameda’s James Hahn rounds of 66 and 68 with opening and closing rounds of 74, sliding 21 spots to a T-41 finish. Sacramento-area natives Spencer Levin and Nick Watney finished T-48 and T-64, respectively – Watney skidding badly at the end with a final round 77.\nToday’s round marked the end of an era for the Frys.com Open as it was announced that the San Jose-based electronics company was ending its nine-year run as tournament sponsor, with Pleasanton-based Safeway Stores taking over starting in 2016. Safeway has committed to a five-year run at Silverado Resort and Spa – which is music to the ears of former PGA Tour star and current NBC Sports golf announcer Johnny Miller. The San Francisco native is a part-owner of the Napa resort, and was responsible for the re-design of the resort’s North Course, where tournament play is conducted.\nFry’s owner John Fry had hoped for the last few years to relocate the tournament to his private golf course, The Institute, in southern Santa Clara County, near Morgan Hill, but issues with building permits have delayed the construction of the necessary facility upgrades, including a planned new clubhouse. The Fry’s tournament organizers still hope to bring a PGA Tour event back to Santa Clara County, at The Institute, in years to come.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:23:11.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
