The 40-year-old actor said he was pushed to the limits while filming the new movie, which sees him team up with Oscar winning filmmaker Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu for the first time, reported Femalefirst. Not only did DiCaprio have to sleep in animal carcasses and eat raw bison live, but he says that he faced the possibility of catching hypothermia on a constant basis.\n\"I can name 30 or 40 sequences that were some of the most difficult things I've ever had to do - whether it's going in and out of frozen rivers, or sleeping in animal carcasses, or what I ate on set. I was enduring freezing cold and possible hypothermia constantly,\" the Titanic star said.\"I certainly don't eat raw bison liver on a regular basis. When you see the movie, you'll see my reaction to it, because Alejandro kept it in. It says it all. It was an instinctive reaction.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:11:34.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
