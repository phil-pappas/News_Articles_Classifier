But the show in Mumbai was called off on Wednesday after Shiv Sena threatened to disrupt his live concert.\nMeanwhile, the 75-year-old, who made an entry in Indian cinema with his popular song \"Chupke chupke raat din\" for B.R. Chopra's \"Nikaah\" in 1982, expressed his disappointment over the scrapping of the concert, saying he is not angry, but a bit hurt and sad.\nThe ghazal singer emphasised that borders between countries cannot restrict the music from streaming into the hearts of people.\n\"I would like to tell Indians to remain in 'sur', love each other and keep listening to us -- be it live or recorded,\" the veteran told a leading News channel.\nDespite the cancellation causing a stir in the society, the youth wing of the Shiv Sena on Thursday said it won't be proper to host shows by Pakistani artistes in India as long as tensions continued on the India-Pakistan borders.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:58:34.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
