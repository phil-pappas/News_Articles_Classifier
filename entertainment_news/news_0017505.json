Law will be engineering productions for the label’s songwriters and artists. “My new position at Owsla gives me a lot of independence and responsibility,” says Law. “Along with being Head Engineer, I also oversee all of our gear, rooms, and facilities. This all involves a lot of management and coordination along with the studio work.”\nLaw’s first job when he graduated from SAE was as an assistant engineer at Daddy’s House, the private Los Angeles studio owned by Sean “Puff Daddy” Combs. Law’s tasks included doing prep work on recording sessions, tuning vocals, setting up pre-mix sessions, and working with writers who were creating songs for the artists with whom Combs was working - such as the rappers Los, Cassie, and French Montana.\nIn August 2013, Law was hired by Warner Brothers Records to work in the private studio of Rob Cavallo, the label’s president. He then spent nine months as a mix assistant for Grammy-nominated music mixer and engineer Joe Zook (One Direction, The Hives, Pink, Jason Derulo, One Republic, Rachel Platten, Andy Grammer). After doing a freelance recording session for Owsla’s VP of A&R Chris Morris, Law was offered the label’s Head Engineer job.\n“The hip hop skills that I learned while working at Daddy’s House were helpful to my engineering, as there are a number of hip hop elements that are now being infused in the EDM sound,” says Law. “There are also a lot of hip hop/R&B vocals that are being introduced into current EDM productions, so knowing how to record and mix vocals has been very beneficial for me and the tracks that I’m working on.”\nIn terms of Law’s career advice for SAE students and grads , it’s quite simple: practice and network.\n“SAE students and grads should be refining their craft and learning every day, as there’s always something new to discover,” says Law. “Also, get to know people in the industry. The more connections that you make and the more people who you impress with your work, the more chances you'll get to find opportunities that you love. Most importantly, be positive with your clients while you’re in the studio. It’s never fun to work with people who have a bad attitude or bring the vibe down. Smile and always be enthusiastic even if you aren't being treated as well as you’d like to be. Others will notice it and they’ll want you on their team.”\nAbout SAE\nSAE Institute provides aspiring creative media professionals with a foundation of practical theory and valuable hands-on training in their chosen areas of concentration.
