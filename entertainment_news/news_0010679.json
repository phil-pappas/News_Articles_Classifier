Ellen retweeted a link to Daniel's interview and wrote, \"This dude needs a reality check.\" A follower later commented on Ellen's tweet, \"@EllenPompeo @JustJared there is a good chance that's not exactly what he said, the media can embellish things.\" The \" Grey's Anatomy \" star then replied, \"You are absolutely right! I certainly have been there.\" Another follower wrote, \"@EllenPompeo but true fans (and reasonable people) know that the media tends to blow up everything and twist it to get a good headline,\" to which the \"Daredevil\" actress replied, \"Yes they do #smart girl!\" In an interview with TimeOut, Daniel was asked whether he would reprise his role as James Bond after \" Spectre \". The actor replied , \"I'd rather break this glass and slash my wrists. No, not at the moment. Not at all. That's fine. I'm over it at the moment. We're done. All I want to do is move on.\" When asked if he wanted to move on from \"Bond\" for good, Daniel said, \"I haven't given it any thought. For at least a year or two, I just don't want to think about it. I don't know what the next step is. I've no idea. Not because I'm trying to be cagey. Who the f**k knows? At the moment, we've done it. I'm not in discussion with anybody about anything. If I did another Bond movie, it would only be for the money.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 Leave a Comment Required fields are marked with *", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:01:30.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
