We want to hear it. \nAs for what you'll be able to try out, Bethesda has confirmed one map will be available - the industrial-themed Heatwave. Only 6v6 team deathmatch will be on offer, and one Demon form in the shape of the Revenant. In terms of Power Weapons, you'll get to try the Gauss Cannon (perfect for taking out demons) alongside regular weapons like the Vortex Rifle, the Super Shotgun, the Repeater, the Rocket Launcher, the Static Cannon and Plasma Rifle. Finally, Frag Grenades and Personal Teleporters will also be available. \nLast year, Bethesda announced that owners of Wolfenstein: The New Order would gain access to the Doom beta. We don't know when the beta will start but we'll let you know as soon as more information comes to hand. \nLast we heard, getting Wolfenstein on PS3 grants access to the PS4 Doom beta and doesn't require a PS Plus subscription to participate. picking up the Xbox 360 or Xbox One versions gets you into the Xbox One beta, although you'll need an Xbox Live Gold membership to get into the action. \nLuke Karmali is IGN's UK News Editor.
