It's just not going to happen. I'm not going to hire you.\" \nHowever, on Sunday she took to Facebook.com to clarify her words and apologize for any offence she may have caused. \n\"My comments about discrimination have spun out of control,\" she wrote. \n\"I'd like to begin by saying that I was not attacking a specific race, but repeating a name that was said in a viral video which has received over 2 million likes. \n\"I have been denied many jobs because of my skin color, body size, and age. Each time I was rejected, my self esteem was negatively effected (sic), so i empathize with those who feel victimized by what I said.\" \nShe concluded by saying she wanted to be part of the solution, not the problem. \nRaven also added that while she made a comment about not hiring someone based on name, it wasn't actually true and that she'd never discriminated against anyone. \n\"My comment was in poor taste. My lack of empathy towards name discrimination was uncalled for,\" she summed up. Raven's father Christopher B. Pearman also logged on to Facebook to stick up for his daughter and clarify that while he doesn't agree with her comments, viewers should see it as the slip-up it is. \n\"Raven is a really Beautiful, Sweethearted, Human Being.I should know. Her Mother and I Love her Very much and will always support her and have her back. Even if sometimes she says some dumb S#%T!
