Kim had found that the child had been sexually abused, but later changed his findings after the state's expert reviewed the case, Dimitrijevic said. If that expert is available to testify at Willis' latest trial date set for Jan. 4, Dimitrijevic said that testimony would bolster the state's theory that Willis, and not a boyfriend, killed the child.\nWillis has pleaded not guilty in the death of her daughter, Mariah Dawson, whose unresponsive body, described in court records as covered in bruises, scars and marks, was brought to St. Catherine Hospital in East Chicago on Sept. 30, 2009.\nDefense attorney Susan Severtson said the defense does not agree to the delay. \"We understand the state's position,\" she said. \"Dr. Kim did the autopsy and we feel his opinion would hold more weight before a jury.\"\nWillis' trial date in January is about one week before the deadline for the prosecution to try the case. The case has been set for trial 18 times.\n\"There will be no further continuances,\" Murray said. \"Anything following this will be a trial or dismissal.\"\nMeanwhile, Severtson said her client has been on the ICU Court Monitoring program since her release on Oct. 23, 2014. She has not missed a court date in the months following her release, Severtson said. \"Committing a new alleged offense is outside the realm of possibility,\" Severtson said.\nMurray said he will order Willis released from the ankle monitor.\nRuth Ann Krause is a freelance reporter for the Post-Tribune.\nCopyright Â© 2015, Post-Tribune Trials and Arbitration Homicide", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562e76a9/turbine/ct-ptb-willis-trial-date-moved-st-1027-20151026-thumbnail"], "published": "2015-10-26T20:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:11:45.361+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
