Each better is more consistent. And I've seen them experiment with some different styles during their 11-plus months in business. I have faith in brewers Zack Hill and Dan Western. I think they make some solid stuff. (Aside: I really enjoyed their Centennial SMaSH -- single malt, single hop, beer that is one right now. It was super simple. And I loved how the floral and citrus-y notes of Centennial hops shined.) LB released Scarecrow Pumpkin Ale this week. Shockingly enough, I dug it. It wasn't a typical pumpkin spice assault. Instead, this one had a nice hint of pumpkin flesh-iness (since they chopped and smoked pumpkin chunks) and the spice bill was understated. It was a nice mixture of ginger and cinnamon (and whatever else fall-like they pulled out of the spice cabinet). I really dug the firm bread-iness in the malt backbone that supported the spices well. It was a winner. And I recommend you give it a shot. It's available right now at the Atlantic Avenue brewery.\nPlease stay tuned to this exact channel as I will be ramping up my beer blogging. I plan to write brief reviews, industry highlights, and talk about some of the local happenings I'm excited about. And as always, please drop me a line. I love when beer turns into discussion.\nWCLEVELAND@Gannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T04:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:21:20.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
