Bob Mezan reports.   \nChris Rock will host the Oscar ceremony for a second time next February, bringing what is expected to be an edgier feel to Hollywood's biggest night. The comedian last hosted the live Academy Awards telecast in 2005, winning mixed reviews for his pointed remarks on politics and race and helping to draw an audience of some 41.5 million American viewers. The hosting job is regarded as one of the biggest honors in the entertainment industry. But it is also one of the most difficult, as it requires mixing comedic monologues, keeping a three-hour show moving, and entertaining both the movie industry's biggest players as well as viewers at home. Last year, Neil Patrick Harris hosted. Critics panned his efforts and the U.S. television audience fell to its lowest level in six years with some 36.6 million viewers.  //reut.rs/1ZYq65n", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:26:55.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
