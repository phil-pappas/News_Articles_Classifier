The human race is the creation of God, who created mankind in His own image. Therefore, man could not have evolved from animals as some say, according to the author.\nEbanks believes, \"Mankind is the greatest creation of God. In fact, the way man developed technology is proof of this. Humans can do just about anything, while animals do not have the same abilities.\"\nIn the book, the author outlines his position that human DNA cannot change, nor can animal DNA change from animal to human DNA. He states that mankind has found it hard to live in harmony and with unselfishness, and instead has waged war throughout the ages. It is his contention that this fighting led to the great war of the superpowers in the modern world, an event that is found in Revelations and predicted in the Bible. In the end, he believes that after the battle of Armageddon, mankind will finally reunite and live in harmony.\nWatch the video at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQ0_dRYdCk&feature=youtu.be\nThe second book, \"True Confession: A Close Call Back to Prison,\" is the true story of the author’s battle to reclaim his soul.
