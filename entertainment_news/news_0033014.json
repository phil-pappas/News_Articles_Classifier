What do they say? There’s nothing else like these:\n\"I've used different straighteners for hundreds of clients, and they have never asked me before if they could buy one after the first styling!\"\nThese infrared tools leave the hair with terrific shine. \"It feels superior to the touch. These irons visibly smooth curly, frizzy and textured hair better than other irons.\"\n\"One client who has never been interested in straight hair was impressed by how quickly I could smooth her hair and inquired about buying one immediately,\" said one stylist. “There was absolutely no burning or smoking, just the product steaming off with no order.”\nSaid Rivera, “Other companies claim they have infrared tools, but there is a ceramic overlay that does not give the full benefit of the infrared Ours are the real deal.\n“You can actually see the infrared light, and with no ceramic coating you get the full benefit of the infrared technology that is actually proven to stimulate hair growth,” said Rivera. “It steams the hair, so instead of seeing smoke and smelling product when ironing the hair, ours actually steams the hair and keeps the moisture in the hair instead of drying it out.\nThe technology is so good that “you do not even need hair product when using our tools because of the moisture it keeps in the hair to give it shine.”\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13042405.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13042405.htm"], "published": "2015-10-24T22:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T23:50:00.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
