Director George Miller recently said that he's not sure that he would bring back Theron's character to \" Mad Max: The Wasteland \". \"I'm not sure, is the answer,\" Miller told DigitalSpy when asked about Theron's return. \"She's not in the 'Mad Max' [sequel] story, but one of the stories, there's an interaction between the two [Max and Furiosa],\" Miller said. \"But I can't really say more than that because it's still in progress,\" he added. There have been rumblings that Miller and Warner Bros. are planning two more \"Mad Max\" films, with the first titled \" Mad Max: The Wasteland \" and the other one rumored to be called \"Mad Max: Furiosa\". After hearing Miller's latest statement about Furiosa's involvement, the second sequel now sounds a little doubtful. However, it's not surprising to hear rumor that Furiosa would not return to the franchise. Furiosa herself, Theron, had hinted previously that she had a low desire to play her character again, but she had some wise reasons for not returning. \"We made a very hard movie. We're about to release it the world, and that's scary. I've got my life and a 3-year-old as well. There's no part of me that's like, 'No f**king way will I ever do that,' \" Theron explained. \"But there is a very realistic part of me that knows this movie was really made on the basis of all the right reasons why George wanted to make this movie - and Warner Bros. will tell you that. Unless that happens again, I wouldn't trust the process.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Mad Max: The Wasteland News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T07:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:11:31.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
