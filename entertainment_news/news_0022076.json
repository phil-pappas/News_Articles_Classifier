Published by New York City-based Page Publishing, Jeanne McNally’s prolific tale tells a story about seeking the truth and unbelievable fate.\nHer future cast in stone since birth, Sydney Madison Graystone the 4th was heir to her family’s multimillion-dollar corporation. Groomed by her grandfather to be a hardcore businesswoman, Sydney earned a reputation as a work-driven, inflexible, iron-handed executive, subsequently earning herself the title of “Ice Princess.” Something enters Sydney’s well-ordered life causing unbelievable upheaval. Her drunken, self-absorbed, and irresponsible twin brother, Kyle, is sleeping on her living room sofa. However, when tragedy strikes, Kyle is nowhere to be found. Sydney looks for support, but only one person offers to help her—a man she may have misjudged—Nicholas Tillman.\nAfter many months of hard work to rebuild his reputation, Tillman’s new accounting firm is thriving. He offers his assistance to a struggling woman that he later recognizes is the very same executive that ruined his career. Upon realizing her identity, anger and resentment come flooding in, but Tillman will find his future surprisingly linked to this woman.\nWith charges of embezzlement looming over his head, Tillman must seek Sydney’s help in locating the real criminal in order to clear his name. The international team Sydney has chosen develops a strong friendship that bonds them together as comrades, but for two of them, their causal relationship becomes a catalyst for passion and desire.\nReaders who wish to experience this potent work can purchase “Enough is Enough” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708.\nAbout Page Publishing\nPage Publishing is a traditional New York based full-service publishing house that handles all of the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
