Bennett and Green, along with staff members and a parent volunteers, led students through the drills.\nBennett's station required students to run through a series of tires and hula hoops, then jump over a small barrier and catch a pass from the Bears tight end. Bennett told students to use their imagination and picture the tires as alligators.\nStudents listened excitedly to any tips Bennett and Green had to offer.\n\"You actually catch the ball with your eyes, not your hands,\" Bennett told a student before giving him a second chance to catch a pass. \"You have to look the ball all the way to your hands. If you can see it, you can catch it.\"\nNext to Bennett's station, Green led kids in a tackle drill. The foam dummies students tackled had Green Bay Packers logos stuck on to them.\n\"I haven't seen anyone really lay this quarterback out yet,\" Green challenged right before a student \"sacked the quarterback\", causing a fumble.\nAfter the kids tried their hand at the different drills, everyone headed inside to hear Green and Bennett read the first four chapters of Green's book.\nBut first, a surprise from the students: The sixth-graders had been practicing their own version of \"The Super Bowl Shuffle,\" aptly renamed \"The Reading Shuffle.\"\n\"We're not here to cause no trouble, we're just here to do the reading shuffle,\" students sang while executing a choreographed dance with sunglasses on.\nAfter their energetic performance and demonstration of their athletic skills outside, Green had the students' full attention as he read the first chapter of \"Kid Owner,\" a story about a Texas kid who inherits the Dallas Cowboys.\nBennett took over reading the second and third chapters, and did so with a zeal that got kids laughing and interacting with him. He used a high-pitched voice to read the part of the main character's mother and got out of his chair to act out the mother telling her son to go to his room. Students could clearly relate to the situation.\nAfter two students volunteered to read a few paragraphs out loud, Green took over with chapter four, which ended in a cliffhanger.\nStudents begged for another chapter, but as Bennett and Green announced they had to leave, they unveiled a stack of books. Each students would get a new, signed copy of \"Kid Owner,\" Green announced.\n\"In reading Tim Green books, every chapter ends in a cliffhanger,\" sixth-grade teacher Holly Lannert said. \"He incorporates sports into books and connects with kids who, outside of school, are very active. The kids can't put the books down.\"\nLannert said sixth-grade teachers have been reading Green's books to their classes since the beginning of the school year.\n\"We're always trying to find ways to motivate students to read, and this has really worked as a catalyst to jump-start reluctant readers,\" she said.
