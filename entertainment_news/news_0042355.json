They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists.\" \nTrump's comments sparked outrage among the Latino community, and Spanish star Iglesias has now joined anti-Trump activists by launching a boycott of his venues. \n\"I have sung many times in his casinos, but I won't do it again,\" Iglesias tells Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia. \n\"He thinks he can fix the world forgetting what immigrants have done for his country. He is a clown! And my apologies to clowns.\" \nIglesias's last album was a love letter to Mexico - the record, which was released in September, featured tracks by some of the country's most famous songwriters. \nTrump's comments have previously been criticized by stars including Ricky Martin, Eva Longoria and America Ferrera, while bosses at NBC also decided to drop their coverage of the businessman's beauty pageants in the aftermath of the controversy.
