The actress is currently gearing up for the much-awaited Ram Charan-starrer Bruce Lee and sources close to the film’s unit have suggested that the Kick 2 actress has charged a whopping `1.5 crore to feature in the film. While refusing to disclose the amount she received for the film, Rakul said there was no harm in charging more during the peak of her career. \n“Everybody gets a hike in their respective jobs and I feel I’m getting better with every passing film. I feel that I’m charging what I deserve. My managers take stock of all aspects, including demand and other aspects and decide, what is the big deal in hiking the price,” the actress quipped. \nDirected by Srinu Vaitla, Bruce Lee has turned out to be one of the most highly anticipated films after Megastar Chiranjeevi agreed to feature in the film in a cameo role. Rakul, who’s known for her performances in films like Loukyam and Pandaga Chesko, says working with megastar Chiranjeevi was the highest point in her career. \n“It’s the most memorable moment in my career when Chiranjeevi garu paid me a compliment. He said that I looked gorgeous and liked the confidence in my performance. It was a moment I’ll never forget,” the actress gushed. \nApart from Bruce Lee, Rakul also has big ticket films – Nannaku Prematho opposite NTR Jr and Saronaidu opposite Allu Arjun – lined up for release next year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:06:10.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
