Taken with the fourth pick in the draft, Watkins pulled down 65 catches for 982 yards and six touchdowns last season but that is not the case this season. He was drafted by the Bills fourth overall in the 2014 NFL Draft. He played college football at Clemson. \nWatkins has not seen much action, with just seven catches for 99 yards and a touchdown in three games. When Watkins is healthy, he wants that to change. Watkins went on a rant to Buffalo News’ Tyler Dunne that was surprisingly upfront about not getting enough targets, according to Yahoo . \nWatkins expects to play today against the Bengals. Watkins will be playing at less than 100 percent, as his calf injury is still affecting him. \n“That’s what I get mad at — when I don’t get looked at [by quarterbacks],” Watkins said. “I can look at film and his eyes go straight that way and I’m not getting looked at, at all. That’s when I get frustrated. When I have one-on-one coverage, go to me. \n“I don’t care what’s going on over there. I don’t care if he’s open. When I get one on one, just target me.” \nWatkins noted that top receivers like Julio Jones, A.J. Green, and second-year receiver Odell Beckham Jr. all get targeted by their quarterbacks in one-on-one situations, and he said he should get the same treatment. A video posted by Sammy Watkins (@sammywatkins) on Oct 13, 2015 at 5:55pm PDT \nWatkins then demanded he get at least 10 target per game. \n“Everybody looks at you getting zero catches, zero yards but when you look on film 90 percent of the time you’re open. I understand that these guys [quarterbacks Tyrod Taylor and E.J. Manuel] are young and they need some time to trust me. Once we get that trust, it’ll be different. But for me, I need the ball at least 10 times — I need 10 targets — and I’ll be fine with however many yards I get. And that’s what I addressed in talking with my agent. We reached out to a couple people and tried to pull some strings like, ‘Hey, I need my targets. You came up to draft me and I’m not getting targets — that’s a problem. You’re making me look bad and you’re making yourself look bad. Why not make both of us look good?'” \nWatkins also wouldn’t complain about getting even more targets. \n“I see the bigger picture. I enjoy spreading the ball around. It makes my job easier,” Watkins added. “But at the same time, for a guy you go up in the draft to take as your No. 1 receiver, you would love those 15 targets that Julio gets, those 20 targets that Odell gets. Of course I’d have 100 yards every game and a TD, if I’m getting 20 targets.” \nEight-time Pro Bowler and NFL Hall of Fame tight end Shannon Sharpe responded to Watkins’ comments on SiriusXM . \n“Now I lobbied John (Elway) in the huddle, that’s different. Didn’t nobody know about that, I’m telling you now. My job is — when you put me in the situation — to go make plays. That’s my job. My job is not what to tell you what I can get open on. My job isn’t to tell you to throw me the football. But keep your mouth shut. Go to the person that you have the problem with. \n“This is Tyrod Taylor’s first year starting — he’s not a seasoned vet like Tom Brady or Peyton Manning. He’s not gonna be able to go one, two, three, checkdown, throwaway. Right now he’s in a situation where he’s looking for his first receiver or he’s taking off running if he’s not open. Give him time. \nBut I want Sammy Watkins to be quiet, get on the football field and give them a reason to give him ten targets again. The mistake he is making, because they moved up to select him, he feels that there’s some kind of obligation that the team should give him, because you traded up to get me. Nah, you earn that, bro. Where you got drafted has nothing to do with how many balls I’m gonna throw you, you gonna earn it. And you talking about it doesn’t help the case.” \nDo you agree with Watkins or Sharpe?
