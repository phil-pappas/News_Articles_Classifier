Donovan (Hanks) is chosen as the unlikely legal defender of Russian spy Rudolf Abel.\nBoth the trial judge and popular American sentiment wanted Abel quickly tried and just as quickly executed.\nDonovan, married and a father of three, was pilloried in the press, his home was hit by rocks and bullets and he became a pariah, even at his law office.\nBut in 1960 when spy plane pilot Gary Powers was shot down over Russia, Donovan was en­listed to enact a trade.\n“Bridge” is a belated salute to an unsung American hero who died in 1970.\nDoes Hanks, 59, see Donovan as a bookend to his other­ profiles in courage in “Philadelphia,” “Saving Private Ryan,” “Captain Phillips”?\n“I don’t view this as a bookend to anything because every movie starts fresh and has to exist on its own,” said the actor at the Ritz-Carlton, where he sported a moustache for Clint Eastwood’s “Sully.” He portrays American pilot Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger, who saved every­one aboard his doomed plane when it made an emergency landing in the Hudson River.\n“The interesting thing that happens when you play someone real,” Hanks continued, “is you have to have meetings with them — if they’re alive — and you have to go, ‘Look, I’m going to say things you never said, do things you never did and going to be places you never were. Despite this, how can we do things as authentically as possible?’\n“Much like the boss” — Spielberg — “I was fueled by absolutely no preconceived knowledge of James Donovan. I knew nothing about the man, so when you’re coming across this guy who is an awfully good insurance lawyer, who ends up becoming a part of such a momentous six days in history, well, I’m a selfish actor and I’ll lunge at that opportunity regardless of anything else I’ve done prior.”\n— cinesteve@hotmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:57:34.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
