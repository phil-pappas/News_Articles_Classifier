I think everyone’s had their moment on tequila over the years, but when you get older you appreciate it a bit more.” David and Victoria Beckham (Nicholas Hunt/AP) \nThe footballing legend also revealed he is a much better packer than his fashion designer wife. \n“I’m one of the best packers you will probably ever meet,” he said. “I’m obsessed with being ready and having everything in place. I’m very well prepared for any trip that’s coming up.” \n“I have friends that take the mickey out of me for it, and my wife is a last-minute packer and nowhere near as organised as me.” \nWhen it comes to his “must-have” thing when jet setting around the globe, he’s very “particular”: “I do like a candle, I must admit, which I know is a bit … you know, particular. I’m a fan of Jo Malone and Diptyque. My favourite is Jasmin Diptyque.” Share article \nSee the full interview with the November issue of Conde Nast Traveller on sale from Monday October 5.
