Entertainment Tonight reports Odom opened his eyes and was able to communicate. When asked to see his children, he communicated “Yes”, but it’s unclear if he spoke or used body language, ET reports citing an unnamed source. \nBut TMZ reports that while there have been some body movements, including eye opening, doctors have made it clear the movements are all involuntary. The website however quotes sources familiar with the situation as saying tests carried out on Friday showed Odom’s heart function is “much better”. Doctors told his family and friends this is a good sign of improvement, that a critical organ is responding, the website reports. So sad ...

He is currently in a coma at the Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas. \n“I think Lamar is done. I think most of it is because he missed my son so much,” Guillermo Castillo told The New York Daily News. \nMr Castillo’s son Jamie Sangouthai - a best man at Odom and Khloe Kardashian’s 2009 wedding - died in June from a flesh-eating bacteria linked to intravenous heroin abuse. \nSpeaking of Odom’s close friendship with his son, who also appeared on the couple’s E! reality show Khloe & Lamar, the grieving dad said: “I think deep inside they had a death wish, or a wish to die together. It sounds very cold-blooded, but I have a hard time controlling my emotions.” Family friend ... Jamie Sangouthai with Khloe Kardashian. Picture: Facebook Source: Supplied Death wish? ...

But the family’s call for him to stop doing media interviews have fallen on deaf ears with Mr Hof saying he told a Kardashian publicist “to go to hell”. \nA man who claimed he was Odom’s former drug dealer in New York told Radar Online that Odom smoked more than $US50,000 worth of cocaine from 2010 to 2013, even binging before NBA games.

He likes to smoke it,” the man said. \nAs Khloe Kardashian continued her bedside vigil, reports emerged that he had squeezed the hand of his sister-in-law Kim Kardashian. Family in pain ...
