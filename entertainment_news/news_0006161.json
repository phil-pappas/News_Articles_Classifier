The British actress who plays FBI agent Kate Macer alongside Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin in her latest movie \" Sicario \" believes talking about the issue will make it worse. \"I sometimes feel that we can exacerbate the problem by talking about it more,\" she said in an interview with Radio Times. \"I think you can keep talking about it and create more and more of a stamp of divide. I think we need to do more - and stop talking about it.\" The \" Edge of Tomorrow \" actress also said, \"Sure I've experienced sexism.
