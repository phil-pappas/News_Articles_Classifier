In an interview with W Magazine for its November edition, the 38-year-old actress revealed his desire to play a nefarious character in any of James Bond movies. Chastain admitted that she really wanted to play a character who would fight against the 007 agent. \"One of my goals is to play a villain in a Bond film,\" she told W. \"People ask me if I want to be a Bond girl, and I say, 'No, I want to be the villain.' I'm waiting for that call!\" Since her breakthrough role in \" The Help \" in 2011, Chastain has appeared in multiple big projects. She most recently appeared as a NASA commander in \" The Martian \" alongside Matt Damon . It seems like Chastain is quite selective in choosing a role as she had a certain reason why she wanted to star in the astronaut movie. \"Ripley in 'Alien' was originally written for a man - [Director Ridley Scott] was the one who changed it,\" she explained earlier this month. \"I mean, Ridley Scott made 'Thelma and Louise'. He's incredible. It was one of the reasons why I wanted to work with him.\" Chastain previously starred alongside Matthew McConaughey in last year's \" Interstellar \" as a daughter of a space traveler. She will next be seen as a creepy sister in \" Crimson Peak \", which is scheduled to be released in North America on October 16. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Jessica Chastain News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T09:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:42:53.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
