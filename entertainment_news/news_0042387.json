Lewis (Simon Jon Provan) and Sigmund Freud (David Sapiro) debate life’s big questions in “Freud’s Last Case.” By Mike Fischer , Special to the Journal Sentinel Oct. 5, 2015 12:38 p.m. (0) Comments \nBetween his flight from Nazi Austria to London in 1938 and his death in London a year later, Freud — a committed atheist — was visited by a young, never-unidentified Oxford professor. It could have been C.S. Lewis, stalwart champion of Christianity. \nTherein lies a tale — as well as Mark St. Germain's \"Freud's Last Session,\" an excellent play that I described as \"smart and moving\" when I first saw it in Chicago three years ago. It's now receiving a first-rate (and first-time) Milwaukee production, in a collaboration between Acacia Theatre and Morning Star Productions being directed by Elaine Wyler. It belongs on your bucket list of must-see plays this fall. \nThis nearly 70-minute theatrical session unfolds in the 83-year-old Freud's study on the morning of Sept. 3, 1939. Within three weeks, Freud will be dead, done in by the oral cancer eating him alive. \nBut as we watch David Sapiro's wearied Freud shamble about his study — stuffed by scenic designer Jay Sierszyn with books and art reflecting Freud's efforts to keep the darkness at bay — much more seems to be ending. \nBritain would declare war on Hitler that morning. We hear it happen, as the men periodically interrupt their chat for BBC bulletins. And we'll also see it, as both men reach for gas masks when they hear the war's first air-raid siren. It turns out to be a false alarm, but it also foreshadows the Blitz to come. \nUnearthing long-buried memories involving World War I, Simon Jon Provan's Lewis is shaken by that siren. It undermines the agile optimism Provan initially displays, as his Lewis — not half Freud's age in 1939 — mentally weaves and bobs around Freud while debating the existence of conscience, moral law and God. \nSapiro is masterful as a Freud who is not only older but darker; while he has dryly humorous moments in a script laced with witticisms, he's also pessimistic about the world, cynical about religion and stoical about his own imminent demise. That makes for interesting debates on the origin of evil and the problem of pain, whether suicide is an option and what happiness means. \nSt. Germain's remarkably balanced script enables the sort of reasoned discussions we never seem to have anymore. Provan and Sapiro do the rest, creating two fully fleshed characters with whom we can empathize because they clearly empathize with each other, for all their stark differences. \nOne sees it in a kindly word or a gently clasped arm, a tender smile or a concerned look — as well as how much these men share, including a marked horror of war. Would there were more thoughtful — and, yes, loving — sessions like this one. Perhaps we'd fight less often. IF YOU GO \n\"Freud's Last Session\" continues through Oct. 25 at Eastbrook Church, 5385 N. Green Bay Ave. For tickets, visit www.morningstarproductions.org/ TAKEAWAYS \nThe Question of God, Part I: St. Germain based his play on a book I highly recommend: \"The Question of God,\" by Armand M. Nicholi Jr., a clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School who taught a course on Freud and C.S. Lewis to Harvard undergrads and medical students for more than 30 years. \nDrawing heavily on Freud and Lewis' extensive writings — as does St. Germain's script — Nicholi takes us through their respective reviews on God, conscience, happiness, love, pain and death. St. Germain somehow manages to cover all of these meaty topics in his one-act play, creating consistently bracing discussions along the way. \nMixing Things Up: St. Germain's script is so good that the two actors presenting it could remain as stiff and still as statutes and one would still pay rapt attention. But director Elaine Wyler and special movement choreographer Michael Landers have given us a bonus: moving Provan and Sapiro around Freud's study in ways that feel natural rather than stagey. \nDoing so not only breaks things up. It's also true to the nature of these characters and the tenor of their debates, with Lewis being temperamentally more apt to thrust and Freud more prone to parry. \nThe movement design also involves these two men periodically switching places, thereby subtly suggesting what their respective points of view and philosophical outlooks have in common. \nDespite his atheism, Freud could never cease being disappointed that inscrutable fate hadn't dealt humanity better cards — reflecting the continually thwarted \"longing\" he describes in this play for a better world and the anger he expresses here at the premature deaths of loved ones. \nConversely, Lewis' belief in a loving God presiding over such a world would be tested all his life by what became the title of one of his best-known (and best) books: \"The Problem of Pain.\" Provan is particularly good when his Lewis comes down a few pegs, humbly admitting that there are many things about God — including the existence of pain — that he can't begin to understand. \nThe Question of God, Part II: Lewis' courageous acknowledgment of doubt strengthened his faith — a paradox that isn't lost on Acacia artistic director Janet Peterson, who has regularly challenged her avowedly Christian theater company's patrons to wrestle with different ways of seeing as a means of thinking harder about their own faith. \nIt's little wonder that Peterson loved this show, upon seeing the same production in Chicago that I did. She's been trying to bring it to Milwaukee ever since, and it's reflective of her generously open-minded approach that she's willingly shared the billing with Morning Star Productions, also a local Christian theater company. That collaboration — of a sort we see far too little of, among Milwaukee theater companies — will expand the number of people who attend \"Session.\" For Peterson, that's obviously — and rightly — what counts most. \nThe Chameleon: During a talkback following Sunday afternoon's performance, one could hear the marveling murmurs when Sapiro, asked how hold he was, informed the audience that he was 47 — despite having just persuasively played a man who was 83. Come January at Soulstice Theatre, Sapiro — a \"young 47,\" as he quipped during the talkback — will playia character in his mid-30s in the world premiere of \"Starlings,\" by local playwright Ben Parman. \n\"I'm a chameleon,\" Sapiro said, jokingly responding to another talkback question. All actors are, of course, but it's nevertheless true that this local actor — who has been doing fine, relatively unnoticed work in Milwaukee for years — is particularly adept at slipping inside the skin of whomever he happens to be playing. Even when it's a dying man nearly twice his age. \nPeople Who Listen: Leaving this show, audience members are handed a short, thoughtfully written letter designed to foster further communication. It emphasizes how respectfully the play's characters listen to each other, true to their shared belief that we learn a great deal about who we are from those who think differently than we do. \n\"It is easy,\" the letter states, \"to get along with people who think and act the same way we do. But if you confine yourself to people who agree with you, the circle will get smaller the more you talk to each other. The only person who agrees with everything you do is you.\" \nSt. Germain's play powerfully makes the same point. \"It was madness,\" Lewis says late in the play, \"to think we could solve the greatest mystery of all time in one morning.\" \"Only one thing is greater madness,\" responds Freud. \"Not to think of it at all.\" © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc.
