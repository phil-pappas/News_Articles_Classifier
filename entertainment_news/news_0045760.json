In between expert assessments of potential items of value, one of TV’s favorite series focuses on the colorful relationship between the men who run this thriving business—grandfather Richard, son Rick, and grandson Corey. Missing In Alaska \nAlso 10 p.m, every Monday, Leepu & Pitbull puts the spotlight on a custom car-making venture operated by unlikely partners: self-made, no-nonsense Long Island mechanic Steve Pitbull and Bangladesh native Leepu, whose fame and talent for turning run-down automobiles into stunning supercars makes for an exciting, in-demand business. Each week, a client comes to the shop with his junk ride, a budget, and a vision of the muscle car of his dreams. Can the odd couple of the automobile industry make their contrasting personalities work in their favor? Hunting Hitler \nHistorians tell us that Adolf Hitler shot himself to death on April 30, 1945—or did he and his wife Eva Braun secretly flee Germany via U-boat to Argentina? That’s the premise of the intriguing Hunting Hitler, which debuts on 9 p.m. Wednesday, Oct. 28. Follow a team of investigators as they attempt to set the record straight on what became of the notorious Nazi leader. With no hard evidence to officially confirm Hitler’s death, the team employs the latest technology and investigative tools to put this unsolved piece of history to rest. Leepu & Pitbull \nSituated northwest of Alaska is a 300,000-square-mile region known as The Alaska Triangle, where over 20,000 people have reportedly vanished without a trace. Local predators, the mythical half-man, half-otter Kushtaka, and even some supernatural force a la Bermuda Triangle have all been blamed for their disturbing disappearances. A team of experts uses eyewitness accounts, painstaking research, and cutting-edge tools to determine the answer in Missing in Alaska, also premiering 10 p.m. Wednesday, Oct. 28. \nHISTORY™ is available on SKYCable Ch 67; Cable Link Ch. 44; Dream Satellite Channel 30; Destiny Cable Channel 57; and Cignal Channel 118.
