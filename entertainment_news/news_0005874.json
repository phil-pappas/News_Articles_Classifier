It was her second failed attempt that year.\nShe first attempted the Cuba-Florida swim, with a shark cage, in 1978 at age 28, at the height of her open swimming career. She called it quits after swimming from the Bahamas to Florida, and then spent the next three decades working in broadcasting and the sports industry.\nShe reignited her dream of swimming from Havana to the Keys in 2010, but poor weather conditions delayed her attempt until the following year, when she failed twice. A fourth attempt in 2012 was halted after Nyad, again suffering from jellyfish stings, was pulled from the water twice during life-threatening storms.\nNyad writes that her team's patience waned in 2013, but she pressed on, determined to finish what she had repeatedly started. Wearing a specialized mask and stinger suit to protect herself from jellyfish rising to the surface during the night, Nyad finally lucked out with favorable currents that sped her toward Key West. She stepped ashore on Labor Day 2013 after swimming roughly 110 miles in about 53 hours.\nNyad gives the controversy that followed her victory — public skepticism from other open water marathon swimmers who doubted her account of the swim — a single paragraph in the book, and then she returns to the internal struggles and payoffs that come in pursuit of a 35-year dream. (For anyone still looking for more data to confirm Nyad's path through the Florida Straits, she says she has the GPS devices used during her swim in a bank vault for safekeeping.)\n\"Find a Way\" makes clear how Nyad did everything her way, even if she was out of step with the rest of the open water swimming community. She didn't keep up with how marathon swimmers started to codify their events during her 30-year absence from the water — and she didn't much care when it came to jumping back into the Florida Straits.\nShe had her vision for the swim, her internal playlists and tricks to occupy her mind during the long hours in the water, her hand-picked crew of supporters and her own expectations to manage. She may not have maliciously flouted any rules, but she wasn't looking for input from outside her protective bubble, either.\nNyad developed her self-reliance and obsessive drive as a traumatized child. She writes rawly about the sexual assaults inflicted by her swim coach and the con artist who raised her, even as they pushed her to fulfill what she saw as her destiny as a swimmer.\nMaybe some readers will find inspiration in Nyad's triumphs over adversity. In \"Find a Way,\" though, Nyad's ambitions don't come across as triumphant so much as needy.\nIn person, Nyad can be abrasive and takes up all the oxygen in the room. Her memoir reads much the same way, as if by being the loudest to proclaim the preciousness of life she can quiet her unresolved demons.\n___\nOnline:\nhttp://www.diananyad.com/\nSwimming & Diving Sports & Recreation Diana Nyad", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:22:55.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
