Community activists hope to draw city dwellers to police precincts across the five boroughs for a “day of solidarity” with the NYPD on Monday — nearly a week after an officer was shot and killed in East Harlem.\nThe organizers, reaching out through clergy councils throughout the city, hope to hold simultaneous vigils at all 77 precincts at 7 p.m., community advocate Tony Herbert said.\n“We have to show (police) the support that we can, the best we can, and that’s by standing with them in unison,” Herbert said.\nJeff Bachner/for New York Daily News Mourners hold hands and pray during the traditional Guyanese wake for Slain NYPD officer Randolph Holder in St. Stephen's Lutheran Church. The vigil will be a symbolic 37 minutes long. The time was derived from the age, 33, of Officer Randolph Holder, who was fatally shot in East Harlem on Tuesday, plus four — the number of officers killed in the line of duty since December.\nRelated Stories EXCLUSIVE: Al Sharpton to speak at funeral of slain NYPD cop Father of slain NYPD cop says his pain will never go away Tears of rage: Officer Randolph Holder's life mattered", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:58:48.368+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
