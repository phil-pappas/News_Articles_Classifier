As many as 12,000 people of all ages strolled among beautiful monuments on the grounds of the park-like cemetery for the annual event sponsored by the Huntsville Pilgrimage Association, according to Cemetery Director Joy McKee. \nActors in period costume portrayed 72 characters from Huntsville's history – from famed actress Tallulah Bankhead, who was born in downtown's Schiffman building, to a prize dairy cow named Lily Flagg whose owner is buried in Maple Hill. \nThe event covers too much history for one story but here are some of the more unusual highlights: \n1. One early businessman's elevator didn't go all the way to the top. \nJacob Emory Pierce (1880-1952), portrayed by Alex Smith. Pierce was the founder of The Huntsville Times newspaper, which debuted March 23, 1910. While he was known as a flamboyant character with many quirks – he eventually spent time in jail for not paying taxes – he is also known as the man whose elevator didn't go all the way to the top. Pierce was the builder of the 1928 Huntsville Times building that still stands on Green Street. It was one of Huntsville's first \"sky scrapers,\" along with Hotel Russell Erskine, which was being built at the same time.

However, the Otis Elevator Co. had already built an elevator system for 11 stories. Pierce is said to have told the Otis Co. representatives that if they couldn't fix the elevators to go to the top, he would not pay. \nTo this day, the elevators go only to the 11 th floor. Pierce never paid. \n2. Lady Gaga wasn't the first to name her followers: Tallulah Bankhead did, too. \nTallulah Bankhead (1902-1968), portrayed by Katie Markow. Tallulah Bankhead, born in Huntsville to the prominent political family, was known for her outrageous behavior and presence on the silver screen. \nHowever, she loved the stage best.

(Contributed by Ezra Elrick) \nEarly in her career, she was a darling of the London theater scene and had a large group of followers she called \"goddesses,\" Markow said, much like Lady Gaga has her \"little monsters\" today. \n3. If you build a Spite House to ruin someone's view, make sure you own the land. \nLeRoy Pope (1764-1845), portrayed by Wil Elrick. Pope, an early settler known by many as the \"Father of Huntsville\" – a title others claim should go to John Hunt – built one of the state's earliest mansions, the 1814 house known as Poplar Grove. Built atop a hill, Poplar Grove had a panoramic view of Huntsville. In 1825, one of Pope's detractors, Joshua Cox, decided to build Leroy Pope portrayed by Wil Elrick. (Contributed by Ezra Elrick) \na house on property in front of Poplar Grove. \nAccording to legend, he made the Lincoln Street house unusually tall – with 16-foot ceilings on the second floor and 14-foot ceilings on the first floor – in an effort to block Pope's gorgeous view. \nHe was successful in his efforts but, also according to legend, he overlooked one detail: He didn't have clear title to the property. Pope did. Cox was promptly kicked to the curb. \n4. Suicide-by-cooking-pot may not be preferred method of death but it does the job. \nThomas Percy (1786-1822), portrayed by Bob Boyer. Percy, who would become the president of Huntsville's first library after donating his massive collection of books for the endeavor, was 8 years old when his father killed himself. \nHis method? He got the largest and heaviest cooking pot from the kitchen, along with a length of rope, then went to the river bridge. Tying the heavy pot to him, he jumped from the bridge, never to be seen again. \n5. Maple Hill is the oldest and largest city-owned cemetery in the South. \nFounded in 1818 by the city of Huntsville, Maple Hill covers 100 acres. More than 80,000 people are buried in the cemetery, and possibly as many as 100,000, according to the cemetery department. \n6. A gypsy queen is buried in Maple Hill...somewhere. Gypsy queen portrayed by Katie Hesse. (Contributed by Ezra Elrick) \nLena Mitchell (1906-1959) portrayed by Katie Hesse. Hesse, as Mitchell, tells the story of her funeral, which was attended by more than 300 gypsies, who followed a hearse and a band along the street to the cemetery. An obituary from 1959 says Mitchell was a palm reader who operated in Hartselle. \nHesse said gypsies are often buried with gold coins and jewelry and it is unlikely the cross marking Mitchell's grave is the exact location of her burial. \nClick here to read more about Alabama gypsies. \n7. How do you make a party honoring a cow memorable? Serve 50 kinds of cake. \nSamuel B. Moore (1782-1839), portrayed by Ron Cooper. Lily Flagg portrayed by Van Brown. Moore was a wealthy planter and owner of a dairy cow named Signal's Lily Flagg. Huntsville's most famous bovine, Lily Flagg is portrayed by Van Brown at the annual Maple Hill Cemetery Stroll. (Contributed by Ezra Elrick) \nThe cow, born in 1884, became more famous than her owner when, in 1892, she produced enough milk to make 1,047 pounds of butter, more than any other cow. Her accomplishment was recorded in newspapers internationally, and she was celebrated in Huntsville. \nOne was held at the new hot-spot, the Monte Sano Hotel, and another was held at Moore's Huntsville home. According to legend, Moore prepared for the event by painting his home butter yellow, building a dance floor and installing some of the area's first electric lights. What topped it off, though, were the 50 different kinds of cakes served at the party, Cooper said. Click here to read more about Lily Flagg. \n8. How a Huntsville man started the Civil War. \nLeroy Pope Walker (1817-1884), portrayed by Henry Turner. Grandson of Leroy \"Father of Huntsville\" Pope, Walker earned his place in history as the first Confederate Secretary of War. In 1861, he ordered the firing on Fort Sumter that started the Civil War. \n9. How many people were dunked by the city's most-baptizing minister? \nThe Rev. Bartley Harris (died 1896), portrayed by Rodney Richardson). Harris was the second pastor of St. Bartley Primitive Baptist Church, the state's oldest surviving primitive Baptist church, which was renamed in his honor. Harris is said to have baptized more than 3,000 people in Huntsville's Big Spring, the water source at the heart of the city.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:55:16.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
