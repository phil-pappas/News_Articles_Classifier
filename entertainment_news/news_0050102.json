But I'm also on a high. Then when I watch it, that's when the emotion comes out.\" \nNow in its 17th year, the star-studded gala at London's Grosvenor House Hotel will be packed with uplifting and moving stories of courage, selflessness and achievement against the odds. \nCarol admits she's rather proud to be involved once more. \n\"I've been part of it for so long now, ever since it started 17 years ago. I'm not just someone who is brought in on the night, I've lived it and breathed it.\" \nIs there any winner that stood out for her? \n\"There have been loads really. The saddest ones are the children who have been ill and then have either raised a lot of money for charity or done something remarkable and then get ill again and are no longer with us and that's really hard, it really knocks it home.\" \nOne of the reasons the shows works so well each year is the fact Carol and the winners get to know each other with a big dinner the night before. \n\"Because everybody travels down to London from all over the country, it's the first time they have met each other and we introduce them all. \n\"I try to sit and talk with everybody and at the end of the dinner I go through all of their stories, and what's remarkable is every single one of them turns around and says 'I shouldn't be here, I'm not worthy.' They are so modest. They get great strength from meeting each other before too.\" \nOne of the most poignant prizes of last year was the first posthumous award in honour of Stephen Sutton, the blogger and activist who spent his final days raising money for the Teenage Cancer Trust. \n\"I remember we pushed his fundraising over the Â£5million mark on the night,\" recalls Carol. \"But it's not just about people who have been ill. The lifetime achievement awards are for ordinary people that we wouldn't read about in normal Press, but they have done these remarkable things; they aren't celebrity driven or media driven or anything, and the person who has won that this year is astonishing.\" \nCarol admits plenty of winners made her cry this year. \n\"One in particular, it was one of the Children of Courage winners. We saw some film at the judging panel. When you read a story it's not the same as seeing it and what this little boy did was extraordinary - I blubbed.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:45:30.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
