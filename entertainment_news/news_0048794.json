Everything you believed in are ruins,\" purrs Waltz. \n\"Why did you come?\" Daniel Craig as Bond in the explosive Spectre trailer SG I can smirk better than you... Daniel Craig and Christof Waltz \nAnd then we get a classic exchange of steely-eyed machismo as the two craggy warriors face each other down. \n\"I came here to kill you,\" shoots Craig. \n\"And I thought you came here to die,\" volleys back Waltz. \n\"Well, it's all a matter of perspective,\" smirks our hero. \nIt's cheesy and a little bit camp and we love it. \nStill not quite as cheesy as Sam Smith's Spectre theme tune which hit No.1 today – the first Bond song ever to top the UK charts. SG SG Has anyone ever actually said no to 007? \nElsewhere we get another glimpse of Lea Seydoux as Madeleine Swann, the daughter of Bond's old assassin enemy Mr White. \nIt seems the icy beauty may hold vital clues to help 007 unravel the tangled and wicked web around SPECTRE. When she's not busy kissing him, of course... \nWe see Bond engaging in fisticuffs in the crowd in Mexico City during the fiesta for the Mexican Day of the Dead. \nWe see him running and leaping to outpace a falling building.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:30:37.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
