Parker’s character Jesse Stone so much, he’s played him in nine TV films.\n“I’m a big fan of Parker’s writing. I told CBS (Stone) has the long-term potential ‘Magnum, P.I.’ had. ... The big lure to me was when I read the first book was ‘I gotta play this guy’ – he’s a mess, he drinks too much, but he’s a good man and a great homicide cop. The problem is he gets way too involved in his cases, which isn’t necessarily too healthy. He also has a sense of irony — not humor, but irony. Some of the stories are very dark, so the humor is very useful,” explained Selleck, 70.\n“Jesse Stone: Lost in Paradise” airs at 9 p.m. Sunday on the Hallmark Channel. Selleck also is the cowriter and executive producer.\nIn “Lost,” Stone, the police chief of the fictional Paradise, Mass. investigates an escort’s murder where the M.O. matches that of an incarcerated serial killer called the Boston Ripper (Luke Perry). Stone believes the killer is still at large.\nReed Farrel Coleman, who’s written two Stone novels after Parker’s 2010 death, said Parker praised Selleck's work as Stone.\n“I know from a very good authority that Mr. Parker was very much taken with Mr. Selleck’s portrayal of Jesse,” said Coleman. “He thought he was nearly the perfect Jesse.”\n“Lost” marks the series’ Hallmark debut. The eighth entry, 2012’s “Jesse Stone: Benefit of the Doubt,” was the last to air on CBS.\n“I did eight shows for CBS, which were wildly successful. It’s rare to find a character to sustain over that length of time. It’s very rare to see a series of movies on TV nowadays,” said Selleck. “CBS abandoned the idea of doing tele-films. We were the last. (‘Benefit’) was No. 8 in the ratings. A certain amount of time went by, then Hallmark came to me and said, ‘Look, we’ve got permission from CBS to do more.’ So Jesse’ll be on Hallmark.”\nQUESTION: Could you compare Jesse to Frank Reagan, whom you play on CBS’s “Blue Bloods”?\nA: I just love this character. He’s also in the police business, but he’s the polar opposite of Frank — he’s a mess, he’s got a lot of issues, but he is a good man and people root for him.\nQ: Didn’t you plan on having this one occur in Detroit?\nA: We didn’t know where to take the show after three years. We had a story in mind where Jesse goes on the road and ends up in Detroit. We still have that story and were really contemplating shooting in Detroit — which I’m partial to — but we started to think that if we’re renewing this franchise after three years. … We better reinvigorate \"Paradise\" and that universe Jesse operates in. The Detroit story was put on the shelf, I hope, temporarily. … It would be nice if we could do that story. I think “Lost” is the best one, so we made the right choice.\nQ: You’re not the only actor with Michigan ties to play a Parker creations. The late Robert Urich, a Michigan State University alumnus, played Spenser on ABC’s “Spenser: For Hire” from 1985-88 and in four TV films.\nA: I knew Bob. He was a close friend. We did a pilot together called “Bunco.” It didn’t sell. The brilliant network executive who turned it down said, “The two of those guys together can’t carry a series.” Bob and I always got a big kick out of that.\nQ: Would you ever play Magnum again?\nA: I would love to revisit him. People said I should do a reunion show, but I think with reunion shows on television, people tune in to see how everybody’s aged. You can’t hinge a show on a reunion. You can hinge a show on a really good story that has a reunion aspect.\nOther studios have tried to get it off the ground a couple times. One studio wanted to do a “Magnum” movie in the late 1990s but without me playing him. They did a survey on \"Entertainment Tonight\" and … George Clooney came in second. I was very flattered (I came in first). Because “Magnum” is so popular and (airing) in reruns, there are many who don’t think the audience will accept anyone else in the role because it was so character-driven. People certainly aren’t ringing my phone off the hook to play him.\nTom Selleck stars as private investigator Thomas Sullivan Magnum and John Hellerman stars as Higgins, in \"Magnum, P.I.\" (Photo: CBS)\nQ: When “Magnum” ended in 1988, one unresolved subplot was whether his frenemy Higgins (John Hillerman) was really reclusive best-selling novelist Robin Masters. Higgins said he was, then recanted. Why?\nA: Our final show was called “Resolutions.” But that is one resolution we always felt (better unresolved). Higgins admits it and then takes it back. I get asked that all the time, believe it or not. I can tell you this: Magnum thought he was. He came up with the theory there really wasn’t a Robin Masters. He was an actor Higgins hired who looked like Orson Welles.\nHiggins was always writing these serious history pieces, but was probably ashamed he wrote these cheap tawdry romance novels — that was Magnum’s theory. It was a theory that caught on so well with the audience. I’m very happy with the way we ended it. It wasn’t a cop-out; it just seemed like a cop-out to say one way or another and really change who these people are. I don’t think Higgins would ever give Magnum that satisfaction.\nQ: You’ve done both TV and film. Do you have a preference?\nA: I go where the best work is. … What’s missing in feature films — at least for me — is that there’s not enough character-driven movies. There’s an awful lot of comic book movies, super-extravaganzas and sequels. There aren’t many movies about people — at least to my liking. When I started in the business, nobody had a movie career at the same time they were doing a series. I don’t think I’m so unique, but I was one of the first actors to have a movie career while doing “Magnum.” That doesn’t make me special, but times were changing. You were either a TV actor or a movie actor before that.\nQ: What's the best part of acting?\nA: When I was a kid, I wanted to be a fireman, then a cowboy, then a professional baseball player. I got to be all those things sooner or later. … When you find these characters somewhere in you that people seem to accept, that’s a great part of the job.\n'Jesse Stone: Lost in Paradise'\n9 p.m. Sun.\nThe Hallmark Channel.\nIt also airs 9 p.m. Oct. 25 on Hallmark Movies & Mysteries.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9412a2712144ab7ef9b82b590b0f24d85142cad1/c=134-141-2206-2904&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/10/16/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635805890997746559-dfpb75759.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/16/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635805890997746559-dfpb75759.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3b85d70a48471695c5009c59b51cb58da6b128b4/r=313x400/local/-/media/2015/10/16/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635805890997746559-dfpb75759.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-16T22:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T13:21:41.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
