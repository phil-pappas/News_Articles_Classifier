Well, for starters, you stay true to the original plotline, but experiment with the characters and dialogues to make them fun, cheeky and perhaps contemporary. Theatre veteran Akash Khurana has attempted this with his latest production The Hound Of The Baskervilles.\nBased on Arthur Conan Doyle's thriller novel by the same name, and starring Detective Sherlock Holmes, this adaptation is a refreshing take on the original. It starts off on a dark night, when Sir Charles Baskerville is found dead on his estate, with paw prints of a gigantic hound beside his body. To unravel the mysterious circumstances surrounding his death, Sherlock Holmes (Karan Pandit) and his friend cum assistant Dr Watson (Arghya Lahiri) take on the case. Was the death caused by an ancient curse of the hound of Baskervilles? Or is there a cold-blooded murderer on the loose? The play states that it is a 'comic' tribute to Doyle's story. But don't expect it to be a laugh riot from scene one till the end. In fact, if you are hoping to see the classic come alive on stage in an intense whodunnit manner, you will be disappointed to see that it turns out rather caricaturish and childish in parts.\nNevertheless, the director has cleverly incorporated a scene in the beginning of the second half, to counter the opinion that the play runs on a 'sluggish' pace. So, you have a quick recap of the first half in the most absurd manner and it is the highlight of the play. Occasionally, the characters break the fourth wall and speak directly to the audience, thus keeping the connection alive. Karan Pandit as Holmes seems miscast in the beginning (you expect someone more mature-looking!) but as he takes on multiples roles, he proves his mettle and acting capabilities and switches effortlessly between characters. He makes you laugh, especially with his silly antics as Miss Stapleton. Arghya Lahiri steals the show as Dr Watson, mouthing the best one-liners. The rest of the cast, Vivek Madan and Rytasha Rathore do justice to their roles. The play has both high as well as low moments, but it takes a dig at Holmes' iconic idiosyncrasies, thus making it an interesting watch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T19:28:05.666+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
