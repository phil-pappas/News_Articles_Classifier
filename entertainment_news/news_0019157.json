And he wants to share it with Gabrielle, the woman he loves, if he can somehow make it to Arizona again, find her and still have money left to take her to California.\nBut first, he has to survive being caught in a long and fierce gunfight that later will be remembered in history books as the Second Battle of Adobe Walls.\nIn Buffalo Trail , Fort Worth writer Jeff Guinn’s well-written, eye-opening new novel, trouble keeps turning up no matter where McLendon goes and no matter what he tries to do. He is something of a human lightning rod for unlucky choices and danger.\nBuffalo Trail is the second installment in a planned Western trilogy that was launched last year with Glorious . In that entertaining book, McLendon has gone on the run from St. Louis, fleeing a ruthless killer hired by his ex-employer, who blames McLendon for his daughter’s death. McLendon ends up in Glorious, a not-so-glorious Arizona silver mining town that soon is rocked by greed and killings.\nIn this book, McLendon goes deeper into the Wild West without good skills as a horseman or gunfighter. And, against his better intentions, he has stopped to find work in scruffy Dodge City, Kan., “spending his days collecting buffalo bones and his nights anguishing over past mistakes. His life was in ruins and it was his own fault.”\nAt first, McLendon and a new friend, the hot-tempered gambler and gunfighter known as Bat Masterson, can make about $10 a day if they can manage to load a wagon with a ton of buffalo bones to sell to fertilizer makers. But it is grueling work, and Masterson has loftier goals for his life. He talks McLendon into going with him on a new path to riches: shooting and skinning buffaloes and selling their hides for $3 apiece.\nBuffalo Trail is set at a time when the buffalo have been hunted close to extinction, and there is talk that Texas cattle soon may be driven north to the rail line at Dodge City.\nBut the rugged men who have relied on buffalo for their livelihood want to try at least one more big hunt, in hopes that it may bring them wealth. To ensure greater success, however, they must trek deep into Indian territory, to land supposedly protected by treaties. And there, they want to create a small community with a saloon and a store that buys and ships buffalo hides back to Dodge City.\nHowever, Comanche chief Quanah Parker has other ideas for the hunters’ settlement. With great effort, he has convinced a number of Cheyenne and Kiowa chiefs and warriors to join forces with their longtime Comanche rivals and massacre the buffalo hunters and everyone else in the tiny Adobe Walls community in the Texas Panhandle.\nGuinn is an accomplished writer, having produced well-regarded nonfiction about Charles Manson, Bonnie and Clyde and the shootout at the O.K. Corral . (He’s also contributed book reviews to The Dallas Morning News .) Here, he treats the buffalo hunters and the chieftains and warriors with care and refreshing respect. He portrays them as normal human beings within their cultures, and not as cartoonish cowboys and Indians. He paints vivid pictures of each group as they gun down buffaloes and get into saloon arguments or ready their weapons and summon the courage to attack the settlement.\nAt one point, Quanah Parker tells his tribe’s “spirit messenger”: “I just want to save our people, help us keep living in the way that we choose, and not bow down to the whites. Did you look inside the tipis of the ones living on agency land? Instead of lances and rifles, they have tools. The white man is making them into farmers. Farmers! It’s shameful.”\nOnce the day of the big battle finally arrives, the book surges ahead at full gallop. It devotes more than 60 action-filled pages to the Indians’ attack strategies and the buffalo hunters’ desperate fights to save themselves.\nJeff Guinn’s Buffalo Trail is history-based Old West fiction at its finest.\nAustin writer Si Dunn is a longtime reviewer of books about Texas and the American Southwest.\nPlan your life Jeff Guinn will discuss Buffalo Trail at 7 p.m. Tuesday at Texas Christian University’s Mary Couts Burnett Library, 2913 W. Lowden St., Fort Worth. He’ll also appear at 6 p.m. Wednesday at Hastings, 791 Dallas Highway, Waxahachie.\nHe’s also among the authors at the Texas Book Festival, Oct. 17-18 in Austin.
