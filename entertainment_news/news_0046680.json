Related Content 'Sicario' film pictures Lionsgate \n\"Sicario\" picture on film's Facebook page. The caption on the page states, \"Can a soldier ask questions?\" This is a special loteria card created for the film. \n“In the lawless border area stretching between the U.S. and Mexico, an idealistic FBI agent Kate (Emily Blunt) is enlisted by an elite government task force official (Josh Brolin) to aid in the escalating war against drugs. Led by an enigmatic consultant with a questionable past (Benicio Del Toro), the team sets out on a clandestine journey forcing Kate to question everything that she believes in order to survive,\" reads the film's synopsis on the official website. \nBelow are some of Lionsgate's production notes about \"Sicario,\" Juarez, the city's recent history of violence, and depicting the city in the film. \nON THE BORDER: SHOOTING IN NEW MEXICO, TEXAS AND MEXICO \n\"Juarez is what happens when they f***ing dig in!\"-Matt (Josh Brolin's character says in the film). \nJuarez, Mexico lies just across the Rio Grande from El Paso, Texas. \nBut for many who live there, it is a world away. \nThe once booming border town became known as \"the murder capital of the world,\" many living in fear and often in extreme poverty. \nThe city was lined with the remnants of foreign-owned maquiladora factories that spoke to an era of global trade that abandoned Northern Mexico. \nAt one point so many people disappeared daily … and so many dead bodies appeared suddenly out of nowhere … that such events no longer made headlines. \nThough Juarez's murder rate has dropped since 2012, the city remains one of the riskiest on earth for journalists and probing outsiders, and new cartels are on the rise. So how was a major motion picture going to penetrate the treacherous realities of this world? It was not easy. Even the location scout was more like a military mission. \nRemembers producer Basil Iwanyk, \"When we decided to go to Juarez, we couldn't find one American law enforcement agency to give us the official go-ahead to go across the border. We went with a Mexican 'fixer' who had successfully brought a CNN crew into Juarez a few years ago, and he contacted a bunch of undercover federales who drove us around. They carried submachine guns in the front of the car and told us very specific things like, I should bring glasses with me, since I wore contact lenses, just in case we got stopped and kidnapped. We drove a white SUV because only the cartel guys drive black SUVs and if you drive a black SUV you can get targeted.\" \nDuring six intense hours, the scouting group was only allowed out of the vehicle twice. \nIwanyk recalls, \"We were shadowed by a white Mustang because we were there too long, but the trip made the movie for us. We understood what Juarez was. It really coagulated Denis's vision. The thing that strikes you about Juarez is that life goes on - there are kids playing ball there, there are people going on with their daily business - but at the same time there's this overhanging veil of darkness and crime.\" \nEveryone who went to Juarez was hit hard. \nRecollects producer Edward McDonnell: \"I remember asking the federales, `What's the good part of town?' They said, 'the good part of town is where they're not killing anyone, and the bad part is where they are killing somebody.' There really is no safe part of Juarez. That's not something you see on the news. You might see figures of how many people died in Juarez, but you don't see the people's lives behind it.\" \nWhile the production did not shoot on the streets of Juarez, the production did shoot over Juarez and the landscape we are seeing in the film is the real Juarez City. \nMost of the filming took place in Albuquerque, New Mexico; El Paso, Texas; and Veracruz, Mexico. \nOscar® nominated production designer Patrice Vermette's biggest challenge was finding a way to re-create the famed Bridge of the Americas, where a major shootout takes place amid the heightened claustrophobia of 14 congested lanes of traffic. \nThe Department of Homeland Security was not about to close down the actual bridge, so Vermette scouted alternate bridges in El Paso, then built his own facsimile. \nTarmac was laid down, narrow lanes were striped and aged with oil stains and tollbooths were installed to choke up the traffic. \nVilleneuve became fascinated with the borderland terrain, setting out to capture the harsh, bone-dry, yet lyrical essence of the badlands - a landscape that seems to mirror what Kate is going through. He brought in a group of trusted collaborators to bring the visuals to life, including 11-time Academy Award® nominated cinematographer \nRoger Deakins, Vermette, and costume designer Renée April, whose works spans from the realism of Prisoners to the wild fantasy of Rise of The Planet of the Apes. \n\"Sicario's colors and textures are directly inspired by the Chihuahuan Desert,\" says Villeneuve. \"I wanted the characters to be silhouettes crushed by the sun. We shot the movie in monsoon season, so every day thunderstorm cloud formations created astonishing skies for us. The sky became a silent character in the film, a poetic expression of Kate's inner and outer torments. The desert is a fascinating place because it is an extremely harsh and raw, infinite brutal space that force yourself into introspection,\" Villeneuve concludes. \"This is what it's like on the border - and we experienced that.\" ‹previous", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:21:07.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
