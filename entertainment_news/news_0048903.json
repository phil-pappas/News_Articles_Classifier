She also has written three plays and the screenplays for 21 documentary films. The Swedish Academy cited Alexievich \"for her polyphonic writings, a monument to suffering and courage in our time.\" \nSpeaking by phone to Swedish broadcaster SVT, Alexievich said winning the award left her with \"complicated\" emotions. \n\"It immediately evokes such great names as (Ivan) Bunin, (Boris) Pasternak,\" she said, referring to other Russian writers who have won the Nobel Prize for literature. \"On the one hand, it's such a fantastic feeling, but it's also a bit disturbing.\" \nShe was at home \"doing the ironing\" when the academy called. Asked what she was going to do with the 8 million Swedish kronor (about $960,000) in prize money, she said it would allow her to write more. \n\"I do only one thing: I buy freedom for myself. It takes me a long time to write my books, from five to 10 years,\" she said. \"I have two ideas for new books, so I'm pleased that I will now have the freedom to work on them.\" \nBorn in the western Ukrainian town of Ivano-Frankviska to two village schoolteachers, Alexievich studied journalism in Belarus, which at the time was part of the Soviet Union. \nShe now lives in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, and like many intellectuals supports the political opponents of authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko, who is up for re-election on Sunday. \nLast year's literature award went to French writer Patrick Modiano. \nThis year's Nobel announcements continue with the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday and the economics award on Monday. All awards will be handed out on Dec. 10, the anniversary of prize founder Alfred Nobel's death in 1896. \n___ \nAssociated Press writer Nataliya Vasilyeva in Moscow contributed to this report.
