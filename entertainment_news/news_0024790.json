We're doomed! We need a revolution! We've got millions of people in the streets. We gotta do something and we gotta do it now,\" David said as Sen. Sanders of Vermont, participating in a mock version of the recent Democratic debate. \nDavid mostly sparred against Kate McKinnon's Hillary Clinton. Alec Baldwin made a notable appearance as Jim Webb, former U.S. senator from Virginia. \nIn the hilarious 10-minute sketch, David gave a spot-on impression of Sanders, hunching his shoulders and talking with his hands. \nDavid's biggest laugh came at the end when he said: \"I'm Bernie Sanders and come next November, I will be Hillary Clinton's vice president!\" \nDavid served as a SNL writer for a year in the mid-1980s. He is most known for co-creating \"Seinfeld\" and \"Curb Your Enthusiasm.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T21:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:55:21.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
