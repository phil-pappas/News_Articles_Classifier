Just kidding.\nDue to an early game start, the Highland bar seemed a little less fired up than Wednesday, when the Chicago Cubs won the wild-card game. But as soon as the last play was made Tuesday night, and the Division Series spot was clinched with a 6-4 win over division rival St. Louis Cardinals, the crowd let the joy flags fly loudly.\n\"We don't need no goat!\" Luann Stirling, of Highland, said once the roar died down. \"A couple years ago, we went down to spring training and ate goat patties, so maybe we ate it and made it go away.\"\nEd Reising, of Schererville; his son, Brad Reising, of Steger, Ill.; John Rosaschi, also of Schererville; and Dave Krcmaric, of Highland, have watched the games at Rodney's since Saturday. In the middle of their table sat a horseshoe in a wax bag, an artifact Ed Reising picked up last Wednesday while working.\n\"I found it at lunch time. I was walking in back of the building and kicked something, and when I looked down, it was sticking out of the dirt,\" he said. \"We brought it out Wednesday, and they won, and now watching the Cards, they're winning. What are the odds?\"\nLifetime of rooting for Cubs warms hearts of senior center residents David Sharos For many Cubs fans Tuesday, work came to a halt late afternoon as the game against the St. Louis Cardinals commenced.

But at the Jennings Terrace Senior Citizen Center in Aurora, seniors were having a party of their own.\nMany residents of the center gathered in the lounge sporting Cubs' jackets,...\n(David Sharos) The horseshoe might've been their talisman, but looking at the team, the Cubs probably didn't need any luck, according to these men. A young, versatile team, the men in blue this year are comparatively different.\n\"Every player on this team can do anything, and every play is exciting. I've never seen this from them,\" Brad Reising said.\nEven some White Sox fans put aside their rivalry to bask in the glory of a Chicago team having its moment. Diehard Sox fan Kevin Skalman, of Highland, and his wife, Erin, watched while waiting for a pizza.\n\"I love baseball, and whenever I see a jersey with a Chicago team, it's a great thing for Chicago and Northwest Indiana,\" Skalman said. \"Everyone's happy and it moves everyone's spirit.\"\nWill he go out and buy some Cubs gear now?\n\"No. Never. I love my White Sox,\" he said.\nCary Stirling, of Highland, said the game went according to the prophesy: the Robert Zemeckis prophesy, that is.\nCubs win, happy chaos erupts at Bally Muck tavern in Waukegan Denys Bucksten Legions of Chicago Cubs fans stopped hoping Tuesday night and began believing in the young team's chances in postseason play.\nWith a dramatic division series win over the St. Louis Cardinals secured about 40 miles away at Wrigley Field, lifelong fans were able to celebrate Tuesday at Bally Muck...\nLegions of Chicago Cubs fans stopped hoping Tuesday night and began believing in the young team's chances in postseason play.\nWith a dramatic division series win over the St. Louis Cardinals secured about 40 miles away at Wrigley Field, lifelong fans were able to celebrate Tuesday at Bally Muck...\n(Denys Bucksten) \"According to 'Back to the Future,' the Cubs were going to win the Series in 2015,\" he said. \"Here we are.\"\nMichelle L.
