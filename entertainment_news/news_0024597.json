I came up with the chorus and got Sukha Kang to finish off the song. This song is very close to me. I've dealt with backstabbers. I'm not going to mention names here but they know who they are. So you can say that this one is for them. For the video, I wanted to do something different and out-of-the-box. I have a background in amateur wrestling and I am an avid MMA fan, so you'll get to see some of that in this video and I think it also goes well with the song.\nYou've collaborated with Harj Nagra, who has worked with some great artists in the industry, for this track. How did you two meet and how did the making of this song come about?\nI met Harj through a mutual friend. I instantly became a fan of his work and we first worked on a devotional track, 'Dhar tere te' for Immortal Productions. The response was great. So, it was only a matter of time that we started working on more projects.\nYou are the lead singer of the group based out of Vancouver En Karma. How did that group form and what else are you guys working on together?\nWe formed the group in 2007 and were just a bunch of guys who loved playing live music. That progressed to recording an album and the rest is history. We are actually in the final stage of releasing two videos from our second album, Enkarmafied , which features Aman Hayer and DJ Vix. We are also working on new singles which will be releasing in early 2016.\nYour group has opened up for many artists over the years. Who has been your favorite artist?\nYes, we have been blessed to share the stage with some of the biggest names in the industry. Everyone has been great to work with and to learn from, but I think the Maharajas Tour that we did with Jazzy B in USA was by far the greatest learning experience we have had.\nHow did you get into the music industry and who inspired you to become the artist that you are today?\nI got into music from a young age, learning the tabla and singing kirtans at a Punjabi school. From there, my interest grew and I just wanted to keep learning. Later, I joined a bhangra team to sing live boliyan . It was from there that I started getting noticed and was asked to join the band, En Karma. I get inspiration from everyone who makes good music. I'm very open to all kinds of music and genres.\nSource: Simplybhangra.com\nWATCH: PAJH LO - OFFICIAL VIDEO - INDER KOONER FT.
