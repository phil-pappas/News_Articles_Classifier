She asks that the media respect her privacy during this time,” her representative told People .\nIronically, Panettiere - who is engaged to professional boxer Wladimir Klitschko - portrays a new mum with the condition on hit country music TV drama Nashville and she admitted she could relate to the situation as she went public with her own issues.\n“It’s something a lot of women experience,” she told US morning show Live with Kelly and Michael.\n“When [you’re told] about post-partum depression you think it’s, ‘I feel negative feelings towards my child, I want to injure or hurt my child’ — I’ve never, ever had those feelings. Some women do. But you don’t realise how broad of a spectrum you can really experience that on. It’s something that needs to be talked about. Women need to know that they’re not alone, and that it does heal.”\nOther Stories The horror of MH17’s final 90 seconds News 0 comments Who were Playboy’s Aussie stars?
