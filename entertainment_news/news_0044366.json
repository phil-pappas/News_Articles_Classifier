He added that 87 Canadian municipalities — including Vancouver and Victoria — have now endorsed the Blue Dot movement. \nYoung, who was in Vancouver last November to perform for the launch of the Blue Dot movement, said: “Dave really has a great idea here ... I strongly believe in this, I think it’s a great idea. I think Canada should have this and show some leadership.” \nWhen the press conference opened up to questions from reporters, the topic quickly turned to Canada’s Oct. 19 federal election. \nAsked for his thoughts about this month’s election, Young said: “a lot of people are upset about what’s going on in Canada today. I’m not happy about Canada’s endless search for a drop of oil.” \nAs a Canadian citizen who lives in the U.S. and travels around the world, Young said he has seen Canada’s image abroad change “immensely” in recent years. \n“It’s been almost a 180,” he said. “Canada used to be a leader.” \nAt one time, Young said, Canada was known as “a country with a conscience.” \nYoung said: “This leadership, they’re just backwards, they’re not looking towards the future of the world, they’re not looking towards what we have to do — we have to take care of the future of the planet.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:59:56.921+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
