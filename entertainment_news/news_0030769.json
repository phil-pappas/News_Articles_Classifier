He is so poised, so confident in the integrity of his vision, he sweeps you instantly into his way of seeing the world. \nTowards the end of the opening episode of The Face of Britain by Simon Schama (BBC Two) , a five-part series on the history of British portraiture , he recounted how the Canadian photographer Yousef Karsh shot the definitive wartime image of Winston Churchill in 1941. Schama was completely in the moment. Eyes sparkling, speaking in the present tense, he built up the background tones of war, of Churchill’s fatigue and “fury” at having to do a photo session, until the moment when Karsh, “seized by a bolt of creative audacity” leapt forward and snatched the cigar from the great man’s mouth. The result: a scowl that captured him perfectly – glowering, implacable, the essence of bulldog spirit . \nHistorian Simon Schama has turned his focus on the history of British portraiture (Photo: BBC/Oxford Film and TV) \nDid it really happen like that? Was there quite so much drama? Schama’s determination to define the tensions rippling through this great image was powerful enough to create its own vivid reality. \nSchama scampered scintillatingly through more than five centuries in his quest to pin down the historical relationship between portraiture and power, exploring how image has been utilised both to propagandise and rein-in the mighty. His analysis of the “rainbow portrait” of Elizabeth I at Hatfield House was a fizzing reimagining of life in an early surveillance state. His summation of Charles I’s visual transition from pre-revolution fop to post-Restoration saint, as entertaining as it was fascinating. His awed delight in the pomposity-pricking power of James Gillray’s savage satirical cartoons was positively palpable. \nEven Margaret Thatcher got the Schama treatment – an instant with a broom elevated into a career-defining political moment. Did that one image really have such extraordinary impact and influence? Perhaps not, but it illustrated a larger truth; Thatcher’s native genius for getting the media to do her bidding. \nIt hardly mattered that Schama’s shimmering articulacy seemed, on occasion, to outshine the very paintings and photographs whose praises he was singing. The truth arrived at was unembellished: portraits, especially political ones, can never be taken at face value.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:40:08.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
