On Monday night, October 19, the remaining nine pairs recreated \"Famous Dances\" with Olivia Newton-John enlisted as a guest judge. Hayes Grier and Emma Slater took the stage first, dancing a jazz to \"Your The One That I Want\" from \"Grease\". Olivia praised the choreography. Bruno Tonioli and Carrie Ann Inaba recognized Hayes' potential, but told him to be sharper and finesse his lines. The YouTube personality earned 32 out of 40 points. Andy Grammer and his partner Allison Holker were the next to perform. They danced a jazz to \"Good Morning\" from \"Singing in the Rain\". Bruno said, \"You succeeded.\" Julianne Hough noticed his steady progress and Olivia said she wanted to dance with Andy \"anytime.\" Andy got a perfect score of 40. Being a leaderboard with a perfect score last week, Alexa Vega couldn't repeat the success this time. She danced a cha cha to Britney Spears ' \"I'm a Slave for You\" and Carrie Ann thought she \"missed the essence of Britney in that routine\" and \"were not aware of all the movements.\" Julianne and Olivia said it's still sexy though. The actress earned 30 points. Bindi Irwin and Derek Hough delivered one of the highly anticipated routines which had been teased all week, a rumba to \"The Time of Your Life\" from \"Dirty Dancing\". They recreated the iconic lift and nailed it. All the judges raved about it and Bindi's performance. They gave her 40 points. Later, Paula Deen created a very big gap with her mediocre performance. She and Louis Van Amstel danced a jazz to Madonna 's \"Vogue\". Olivia, being nice, said, \"You look gorgeous and you look like you were having fun, you did Madonna proud.\" Meanwhile, the others were being honest with Bruno saying, \"The content had to be taken with a pinch of salt.\" The celebrity chef earned 24 points. Carlos Pena Jr. and Witney Carson brought back the show to a high level with their rumba to \"Pony\" from \" Magic Mike \". Carlos was not comfortable being raunchy, but they managed to deliver a sexy number. Carrie Ann said, \"You did it with style and grace.\" Julianne respected Carlos' commitment to the gig despite his dilemma. The judges gave him 38 points. Nick Carter and Sharna Burgess danced a samba to \"You Should Be Dancing\" from \"Saturday Night Fever\". Carrie Ann said, \"It was good but it wasn't perfect\" because he came \"in and out of character.\" The other judges, however, said it was a great samba and Nick brought the disco back. The boybander earned 39 points. Alek Skarlatos and Lindsay Arnold danced a jive to Elvis Presley 's \"Jailhouse Rock\". Julianne admitted it was hard to pull the dance. Carrie Ann said, \"You are just below being a contender but you have possibility; you need to work with a man.\" Alek earned 30 points. Tamar Braxton and Valentin Chmerkovskiy danced a jazz to Janet Jackson 's \"Rhythm Nation\". Olivia said the choreography was \"fantastic\" and Bruno dubbed Tamar \"the star of the show.\" The singer earned 40 points as Carrie Ann and Julianne also praised her flawless dance. Next, it's time for the results. Having been one of the weak dancers of the season, Paula Deen was eliminated that night. Next week, the remaining pairs will return with Halloween-themed indivual dances and team routines. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com More Dancing with the Stars News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T06:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:28:18.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
