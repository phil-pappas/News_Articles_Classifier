Francis has sought to re-energize it, and the contentious meeting underway at the Vatican, in which conservative and progressive bishops are squaring off over ministering to families, has been the result.\n News Nation/World Associated Press", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-17T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T22:09:49.273+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
