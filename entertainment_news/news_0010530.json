Now, Kaan too, might face a similar situation as the film has been put on hold, according to sources. \nThis project had its share of agitation when Varun Manian , who was supposed to bankroll Kaan , backed away from it after citing Selvaraghavan's deferment as he had taken out time to settle his issues with PVP Cinemas following the Irandaam Ulagam debacle. \nDeserted by its producer, the comparatively high budget film was taken up by Gitanjali Selvaraghavan, Siddharth Rao and the director himself in an attempt to complete the project. \nBut that idea has been bestowed with a body blow as the film is currently stalled citing financial issues, according to a report. \nTrisha, who was earlier roped in to play the female lead has walked out of the project due to conflicting schedules with some of her other films, making way for Catherine Tresa.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T09:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:02:30.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
