The actress is currently shooting for a big-ticket Tollywood production — Brahmotsavam — which will have her pair with Mahesh Babu for the first time.\nThe film, she says, has two other heroines, but Pranitha is far from perturbed. \"It is a big deal to do a film with Mahesh and I am very excited. I have just shot with the team for a couple of days, so it is still early days. But the prospect of working with so many different talented people is something that I'm looking forward to. I'm not very picky about the screen time I get, as long as I get to do something different with each role. In my Tamil film Masss, I had all of two dialogues, but a lot to do in terms of scenes and montages. And since my character had a tragic end, it left audiences teary-eyed. Then, in my Telugu film Dynamite, which was an action flick, I got to do stunts myself. Right now, I'd say the variety is keeping me going,\" says the actress.\nThings maybe looking up for Pranitha in Tollywood and Kollywood, but back home in Sandalwood she had just the one release — Second Hand Lover — which was in the making for a very long time. \"It's not a conscious choice to concentrate on Telugu and Tamil films. I am just going with the flow and hope that something exciting works out in Kannada soon,\" she says. The actress has, however, found another reason to come back home often. \"I have just turned entrepreneur, after picking up a stake in a restaurant on Lavelle Road. The hospitality industry always intrigued me and I'd been looking at ideas to get into it when this opportunity came along,\" she says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:12:06.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
