Do you think he’d want to?’ I was like ‘Sure, Julia, don’t worry about it. Everyone’s taking pictures today. Don’t feel bad at all. You know, that’s why everybody is here.'”\nPHOTOS: Ronda Rousey relaxes at the beach with friends\nRousey, 28, headed over to Bieber but didn’t quite get the response she was hoping for.\n“I walked over there, I said, ‘Excuse me,’ and he turned to me and goes, ‘I’ve already taken a billion pictures today, OK?’ And I said, ‘Yeah, but,’ cause she’s the only 16-year-old girl at the whole party, you know? I only got a ‘Yeah, but’ out and he goes, ‘A billion,’ and walks off and totally snubbed my little sister.”\nAccording to Rousey, young Julia was on the verge of tears when she said, “I’m no longer a Belieber.” Well, neither is Rousey after the exchange.\n“Yeah, I don’t think I’d want to hang out with him,” she said.\nThis article originally appeared in the New York Post 's Page Six .", "external_links": ["http://pagesix.com/2015/10/07/ronda-rousey-says-justin-bieber-snubbed-her-little-sister/", "http://www.nypost.com/", "http://pagesix.com/tag/ronda-rousey/", "http://pagesix.com/", "http://pagesix.com/tag/justin-bieber/", "http://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/news/a47347/ronda-rousey-bieber-feud/", "http://www.tmz.com/photos/2015/08/07/ronda-rousey-on-the-beach-photos/images/2015/08/07/0807-ronda-rousey-beach-photos48-jpg/", "http://pagesix.com/tag/cannes-film-festival/"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:21:53.358+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
