And while Gwen Stefani filled her group of promising singers with 21-year-old Redding, California artist Summer Schappell, following a peppy performance of Strawberry Wine, it was Pharrell who walked away with the most favourable star of the week after nabbing the artist that Adam called potentially, “the greatest singer in the show’s history and the most beautiful.” It was 26-year-old singing beauty, Amy Vachal who had the coaches vying for her skills after a delicate version of Dream a Little Dream of Me , which she accompanied on guitar. The battle rounds commence next week when the coaches and their teams enlist the help of guest mentors Brad Paisley, John Fogerty, Missy Elliott and Selena Gomez. \nBusey booted from DWTS: Nostalgia flooded the ballroom on Dancing with the Stars this week when the ten remaining celebrities celebrated the most memorable year of their lives. With mirrorball-favourite, Alfonso Ribeiro filling in for Tom Bergeron as the host, it was announced that Gary Busey and professional partner Anna Trebunskaya were the pair eliminated from the competition after a mediocre jazz number to the year 1979, when Busey got his big break as the lead in The Buddy Holly Story. In true Gary form, the actor had some awkward words on his way out. “The fact that I have been eliminated is false because my spirit lives on as a partnership and will remain in this room throughout the show, so you won't see us dancing, but we'll be there,\" he said. It was Bindi Irwin & Derek Hough who reclaimed their spot at the top of the leaderboard with an emotional contemporary number in honour of the late famed wildlife expert Crocodile Hunter, Steve Irwin that earned a 28/30. The judges praised the performance and Bruno Tonioli assured Bindi that her father \"was dancing with you every step of the way,\" before awarding her with the first 10 of the season. And Nick Carter and Sharna Burgess took it back to 1992 to commemorate the year that Nick met his Backstreet Boys brothers and broke out one of their biggest hits in the form of a jazz routine to Everybody. \nKris rips into Cait: “I honestly wish I never met this man,” Kardashian monarch, Kris Jenner cried after reading Caitlyn Jenner’s revealing Vanity Fair cover story when Keeping Up With The Kardashians commenced this week. The claws came out once Kris and her elder daughters got their hands on the magazine and exposed their heated resentment towards the way that Cait had handled the press she received during her transition, criticizing her for publically “discrediting the 25 years of marriage” she had spent with Kris. “I’m not going to be fully supportive if she’s not fully supportive of our mom,” Khloe sternly stated before she struggled with “he” and “she” pronouns throughout the episode. Khloe did seem interested however when Kim disclosed she had seen Caitlyn’s breast implants and admitted that it made her want to get a boob job. To try and smooth over the family tension, Kim visited Caitlyn in her home in Malibu, using recycled previously-seen footage from I Am Cait to tie the storylines together. \nTwitter: @samomaryleona", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:21:11.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
