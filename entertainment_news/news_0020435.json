If that happens, he said, Brown would have the opportunity to appear before the central committee to present her credentials along with others seeking party backing.\nSeveral people — including Alds. Michelle Harris , 8th, and Walter Burnett , 27th; and attorney Jacob Meister — have expressed interest in gaining the Democratic endorsement for circuit clerk if Brown's slating is rescinded, party leaders said privately.

Bruce Rauner has no public schedule.\nFrom the notebook\n*Bully: Spike Lee calls Emanuel a “bully,” says mayor tried to “bully” him. And, for good measure, says a couple of mayor’s aldermen are “bootlickers.\" From the context, appears he's referring to Ald. David Moore, 17th, and Ald. Will Burns, 4th. ( Read the whole Q and A in Chicago magazine).\n*Just a regular guy? Gov. Rauner acted as a pitchman for a Springfield business Thursday, bellying up to the counter to sample a breakfast horseshoe at Charlie Parker's diner.\nThe dish is a heaping pile of bacon, cheese sauce, sausage gravy and hash browns piled on top of an English muffin. The diet buster is in the running for a $25,000 prize from Thomas' English muffins.\n\"The good news is that the doctor told me I had super low cholesterol,\" Rauner joked with owner Mike Murphy before digging in as cameras rolled. \"This is an entire food source of everything you'd possibly want to live off of all in one forkful.\" (Monique Garcia)\n*CTU trick or treat: The Chicago Teachers Union will hold its annual “Legislators Educators Appreciation Dinner” (the event’s stated theme is “ Changing What We Cannot Accept ”) at Plumbers Hall next Friday, Halloween eve.\nThis year’s fete comes one year after union President Karen Lewis made a videotaped appearance there to back Cook County Commissioner Jesus “Chuy” Garcia’s mayoral campaign after a brain tumor ended her own prospective bid for the mayor’s office.\nLewis is back at work now, with plans to seek another term at the union’s helm, and is scheduled to deliver the evening’s keynote address instead of Garcia this time.\nCorned beef will be on the menu, as usual, but it remains to be seen whether a group of teachers will show up in superhero costumes like they did last year. A $50 per head donation to CTU’s political action committee gains admission.
