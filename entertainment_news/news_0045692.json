But before you go rolling your eyes thinking it's another bog-standard chick flick, think again. Loaded to the brim a plethora of comedy talents (including our very own Chris O'Dowd), this Paul Feig-directed and Judd Apatow-produced film is one of the best comedies to happen in the last 10 years. If you've somehow managed to miss this at every other opportunity, park yourself on the couch and prepare for all the laughs in the world. Trust us, no matter what your ails, you'll feel better after watching this (just maybe not around your parents, unless you're a fan of awkwardness).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T23:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:00:43.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
