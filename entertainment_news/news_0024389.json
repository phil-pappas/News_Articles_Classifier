He couldn't stop his tears from rolling down as he was sharing with the world what an amazing person Jessica is. \nJustin Timberlake and Jessica Biel who are married for 3 years now, also celebrated their third anniversary on Monday, October 19. What could be more apt than expressing love for your wife before a huge audience on the wedding anniversary! \nJustin was introduced to the stage by his friend and the 'Tonight Show' host Jimmy Fallon. The 'Mirror' singer took to the podium for his introductory speech of 30 minutes, where he spoke about all the important people in his life. \nHe thanked his beloved wife Jessica for always being there for him and for always supporting him in his ups and downs. He said,\" Baby, I love you more than I could put into words and more than any song I could ever write.\" \n\"Beautiful, loving and incredibly understanding of her husband's shortcomings. She's not from here but she's built like she is!\". He continued, \"She is a rock and, uh, she is tough as nails, so she's basically a Memphian.\" \nWhile wiping his tears Justin realized that the speech had already extended 20 minutes and cracked the audience by talking about his drunk uncle at the Christmas party and said, \"You gotta fix that Beyonc√© wind fan, It's getting in my eyes.\" joking about him crying. \nJustin and Jessica got married in 2012 in Italy and have a 7 months old baby boy. About her son with Justin Timberlake, Jessica jokingly said, \"He's just a joy. It's an amazing, amazing experience. Incredibly hard-the hardest job in the world, and I've never been more thankful and grateful to my own mother,\" \nWe wish the couple on their third anniversary and hope they continue to have a blissful future together.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T13:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:12:53.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
