And there's nothing wrong with that. \nBut exploring the local consignment and thrift shops is more my speed. And as luck would have it, I met a fellow frugalista on the tennis court who gave me just the encouragement I needed. My new friend Susan from Lebanon, who has a condo on the beach, enthusiastically recommended an assortment of tempting consignment shops that she said Ms. Cheap just \"had to\" check out. \nIt was not a hard sell, and once I got out there, boy was I impressed! — not only with the shops Susan suggested, but with some terrific thrift stores my husband and I discovered on our own and came back and told Susan about for future reference. \nWho knew that Destin could be such a bargain bonanza! \nBut I guess it makes sense that there would be top-notch merchandise there, with all of those condos and second homes around Destin, and 30-A, and thousands of well-to-do people coming and going year-round. \n\"We had a man at Sandestin who donated everything in a 5,000-square-foot house\" to the store, said Eddie Mansfield, managing director of the Path of Grace Thrift Store, whose sales support a six-month to two-year residential recovery program for 20 women struggling with addiction. \n\"Everything,\" he repeated. \"All the contents of the house. And it was really nice stuff, like a kitchen table that cost thousands.\" \nMansfield said lots of Destin-area condo owners donate wonderful merchandise to the store and that bargain-hunting shoppers (like me) can find almost anything, from furniture, household goods and clothes to beach goodies like chairs, surfboards, beach umbrellas, coolers and beach toys, at a fraction of what they would cost elsewhere. \n\"We get a lot of tourists,\" said Julie Jones, assistant store manager of the Destin Goodwill just a few miles down Highway 98 from Path of Grace. \"Some come for bargains on clothing, and a lot of them own condos and are restocking them,\" she said, adding that condo owners also donate a lot of merchandise as they redecorate or change things out. \nThe ladies apparel consignment shops that Susan recommended were wonderful, too, great designer and interesting merchandise, and friendly shop staff. \nIt was a nice surprise for me to find these stores right there within a few minutes of the beach, and I figured that with so many of my Middle Tennessee readers choosing the Emerald Coast for their vacations, you might want to know more about some of the good shopping places we discovered: \nHere goes: \nAva's Attic Consignment Boutique , 12889 Emerald Coast Parkway, in Miramar Plaza. Owners Susan Henry and Courtney Hood (mother-daughter team) told me they had started their shop seven years ago with 1,400 square feet of consignment furniture. Now their stores take over a corner of the strip center, with 10,000 square feet of furniture, plus a ladies consignment clothing shop featuring women’s designer clothing items, handbags, accessories and shoes. You serious bargain hunters will want to check out the \"$5 Room\" at the back of the ladies shop for super rock-bottom prices. The store, which was voted \"Best and Finest Consignment Shop on the Emerald Coast\" by local publications, has more than 6,000 consignors and the owners and staff also build and paint furniture and sell their own line of chalk paint. Ava's Attic, named for Hood's daughter Ava, has some kind of discount every day, so be sure to ask. www.avasatticindestin.com or 850-424-6826 or 850-307-5996 \nThe Fashion Exchange Consignment Boutique , in the Winn-Dixie Center at 981 Highway 98 E. in Destin, is owned by Glenda Jernigan. It has been in business for six years and has 1,200 consignors. Lots of name-brand ladies apparel and a very well-merchandised shop. \"We have lots of vacationers and people with second homes down here who bring their clothes to consign with us,\" said manager Amy Spence, who said the shop specializes in \"trendy casual\" and vacation wear, and doesn't do much with business apparel. www.destinfashionexchange.com or call 850-837-8080 \nPath of Grace Thrift Store , at 10962 U.S. Highway 98 West in Miramar Beach, has to be one of the nicest thrift stores I have ever shopped. Great merchandise, well displayed, nice dressing rooms, helpful staff. The shop supports the Path of Grace Home, which is a faith-based, long-term sober living facility for about 20 women who are recovering from alcohol and/or drug abuse. The store is staffed by the women in the program, who are learning new skills as part of their recovery. The shopping was great. I found two Chico's tees for $4 each (one white, one black, very basic, both like new and perfect under a jacket or shirt). Woo-hoo! And don't miss the in-store boutique, where designer brands are featured. pathofgrace.net or call 850-974-4573 or 850-654-8500 Buy Photo \nThis Goodwill store is in a former Mexican restaurant on the main drag in Destin. (Photo: Mary Hance / The Tennessean) \nGoodwill at 747 Harbor Blvd. in Destin is a unique-looking storefront, bedazzled with mosaics on the exterior walls of what was once a Mexican restaurant. Inside you find a nice, clean, well-organized store with bargains galore. In addition to offering the usual Goodwill inventory of clothing and household items, the store was a good bet for finding bargains on beachy things like umbrellas, chairs, sand toys, etc. It would be a good place to look for beach reads, too, since books were mostly $2.99 and $3.99. (850-837-8516) \nThere also is a Goodwill at 3223 U.S. 98 in Santa Rosa Beach and one in Ft. Walton Beach, plus some other thrift haunts that I hope we can explore next time we are lucky enough to get to the Destin area. \nHonestly, knowing all of these treasure troves makes me almost wish for a rainy day at the beach on my next trip! Or at least a rainy afternoon. \nHappy hunting! \nStay cheap! \nP.S. Thank you, Susan, for spurring me on to shop at these great spots on my vacation. And to my readers, please let me know about any other \"Ms. Cheap\" shopping places I should check out on my next trip to the Gulf Coast. \nReach Ms. Cheap at 615-259-8282.
