This year CBS Entertainment Diversity will read the winning Pilot TV scripts for the festival and sponsor a networking after party.\nLAFIFF launched this year with a TV Pilot category in Comedy and Drama due to a growing need from the industry to supply content for TV and the emerging media markets. This need has been spurred by such companies as CBS, NBC, ABC and new media companies such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon. Demand for qualified and talented TV writers is at an all-time high and this is due to these companies and Diversity Divisions such as CBS Entertainment Diversity seeking the next talented writer and/or showrunner.\nLA Femme is a four day festival that screens more than 100 films and hosts special screenings, seminars, and networking mixers. The 2015 festival is the 11th season launching October 15-18, 2015 at the Laemmle Theatres in Beverly Hills on Wilshire Blvd. with amazing seminars sponsored by SAG-AFTRA, WGA West, The Governor’s Office of Film and Entertainment State of Florida, and Columbia College Hollywood.
