What was the first thought that came to your mind while deciding to judge The Stage? I don’t want to judge because I wouldn’t want someone to judge me! What right do I have to judge? But then I thought, hell, if someone is signing up for a competition, they know what they are in for and I might actually have something valuable to add to this whole thing having studied music at NYU and working in the independent music industry here in India. Do you believe English music enjoys the same kind of audience as Hindi shows in India? Definitely. I can see a stadium packed for Armin Van Buuren. I think a stadium will be packed for an Indian artist singing in English sooner rather than later. What is your rapport like with your co-judges? We are a dysfunctional family of best friends. What are your expectations from the contestants? I think the contestants are going to blow people away. They will make you fall in love. They will make you cry. They will move you, change you, and make you wish that the magic of The Stage would never end. Please tell us something about you upcoming projects… My solo album Spit will be releasing mid-November with Universal Music. entertainment television Monica Dogra Colors Also Read 'Haider' to be screened at London Asian Film Festival Amitabh Bachchan turns commentator for India-Pak World Cup match Chinmayi gets embroiled in ugly ‘fan war’ Flashback: Preity Zinta and Ness Wadia's good times together", "external_links": ["http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/TVG%201_0.jpg", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151008/entertainment-tvmusic/article/contestants-stage-will-blow-you-away-monica-dogra", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/TVG%201_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-08T11:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:15:33.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
