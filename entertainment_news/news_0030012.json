But the politics have escalated during the past week into a formal ethics complaint and a move to suspend the work of an active volunteer committee.\nAll of this comes in the wake of a controversial candidate forum, where only two of six candidates for Tybee’s City Council opted to attend. Those who didn’t argued that the sponsor, a political action committee known as Forever Tybee, was setting its opponents up for failure.\nThe ethics complaint\nOn Wednesday, a number of city residents filed a formal ethics complaint against incumbent councilman Paul Wolff.\nIn the official filing, Tybee residents Richy Smith, Diane Smith, Ronald Calloway, Michael Scarbrough, Ronnie Tatum, Jack Boylston and John Branigin allege that Wolff, in an email to members of the city’s Community Resource Committee last May, instigated the filing of an ethics complaint against Doyle.\nAfterward, they say, Wolff denied having told committee chair Kathryn Propst that there was “a clear violation” on Doyle’s part.\nAccording to the emails provided with the complaint, Wolff, the council liaison to the CRC, writes to Propst that an email sent from Doyle to Tybee businesses urging them to oppose a proposed plastic bag ban ordinance “seems to be a clear ethics violation. Council members cannot instruct staff to ... influence a council decision on pending action.”\nWhen asked by Propst how to proceed, Wolff responds, “Somebody needs to file a formal ethics complaint with the Tybee Ethics Commission ... (Doyle)’s definitely violated the city charter by instructing staff to lobby for influence on an ordinance.”\nThe newest filing asks the ethics commission to determine whether it was ethical for Wolff to participate in a vote to accept recommendations related to the complaint against Doyle, to lie about his involvement in the ethics complaint, to tell the CRC to file charges against Doyle and whether he should have called Doyle’s actions a “definite ethics violation ... without having all the facts.”\nJohn Branigin, one of the signers of the filing, said he supported submitting the complaint because Wolff’s alleged actions were more egregious than those that led to the complaint against Doyle.\n“If Mr. Wolff felt that (Doyle) had violated her ethics code, he should’ve put in a complaint, not worked behind her back to influence others to do that,” Branigin said. “She wanted to make sure everyone’s voice was heard, and he tried to silence a voice.”\nWolff said this week he had offered to recuse himself from the action taken by the council on the matter related to the initial ethics complaint. He told the attorney advising the city on the issue that his involvement ended when he answered a citizen’s question.\n“I think based on the email chain they submitted, my comments at the council meetings were correct, and maybe my words were ill chosen,” Wolff said Thursday. “I was responding to questions from the Community Resource Committee members, not telling them — as alleged in this complaint — to file an ethics complaint. Certainly, my intent was only to address committee members’ questions about procedure and whether or not the city charter had been violated. Then I stepped back and let the ethics commission do its work.\n“If my behavior was inappropriate, I’m not going to hire a lawyer; I’m not going to try to fight this. I’ll accept the decision of the ethics commission.”\nThe ethics commission has scheduled a meeting for Wednesday to discuss whether the complaint merits further consideration.\nThe resolution\nImmediately after the ethics complaint was filed, Doyle reported that an amended agenda for the council’s Thursday meeting had been posted online. It included a resolution that launches an investigation into whether members of the Community Resources Committee have complied with open records and open meetings laws. The resolution also calls to suspend any work of the Community Resource Committee while the investigation is under way.\nThe council voted 4-1 in support of an investigation Thursday with Councilman Rob Callahan dissenting and Wolff abstaining.\nAt the root of the resolution is the same group of emails from which the ethics complaint against Wolff is based.\nCity Council Candidate Stephen Friedman said that while he searched through the records provided to Doyle under an open records request, “a substantial number of private/secret documents were discovered.”\nFriedman said the council had a duty to determine whether the volunteer committee violated Georgia Open Records laws when it provided — or neglected to provide — documents related to Doyle’s request.\n“It seems to me that, a vote by any member of City Council against the resolution to undertake such a thorough investigation of potential illegal activity, would be a failure by that member to uphold his or her ethical responsibility to the citizens of the City of Tybee,” he said.\nAt the council’s meeting, CRC Chairwoman Propst argued that her committee was never informed that it was subject to Open Records laws, and that the committee has never been sworn in or included in the city charter as the charter mandates. But city attorney Bubba Hughes said regardless of how the group began, it was charged by the city council to do work on Tybee’s behalf and is therefore subject to open records law.\nCRC members and President of the Forever Tybee PAC Freda Rutherford said the council’s vote this week was disappointing, to say the least.\n“I am also disillusioned to have lost my rights to free speech and privacy, along with my rights to assembly, taken away by my local government all in one evening,” Rutherford said in an email Friday.\nBut Doyle said this week she was supportive of the resolution. Members of the Community Resources Committee accuse others of being unethical, she said, but don’t apply the rules to themselves.\n“I’ve run for elections, and I’ve been on (Council) almost 10 years. I’ve always said I’d never be a part of anything like this. But that last ethics violation, once I pulled those records ... I owe it to the citizens of this island to bring all this out,” she said.\nThe residency concerns\nEarlier this week, an unmarked package arrived at the Savannah Morning News, containing questions about whether Friedman, who moved to Tybee last fall from Marietta, Ga., meets the requirements for qualification as a member of City Council. Similar questions have appeared in the newspaper’s Vox Populi comments.\nFriedman said in an email Thursday that the question has been reviewed numerous times, and “it has been consistently determined that I am a permanent resident of Tybee, fully qualified to hold the elective position for which I am running.”\nFriedman said he suspects the Forever Tybee PAC and Rutherford of disseminating these questions.\nRutherford said in a telephone interview Thursday that she was aware of the concerns but was not involved.\n“I wish I were so powerful, wouldn’t that be lovely?” Rutherford said.\nThe city official responsible for reviewing the information submitted by candidates during qualifying, City Clerk Jan LeViner, said she’s aware of questions about Friedman’s residency, but he meets all the requirements of the city charter.\n“The requirement for being a qualified candidate, per the charter, you have to reside in the city limits for one year prior to the date of election,” LeViner said. “You must be a qualified voter. It has to be your intent to intent to live on the island.”\nThe forum no-shows\nAnother indication of a storm brewing behind the scenes of Tybee’s elections was the participation — or lack thereof — in a candidate forum hosted by Forever Tybee and a local news organization on Oct. 12.\nAll six council candidates had been invited but only Julie Livingston and Wolff showed up.\nForum organizer Shirley Wright told the crowd the no-shows had contacted her with concerns about fairness.\nOn his website, Friedman posted a letter on behalf of himself and incumbents Barry Brown and Doyle in which he wrote that the event set them up for humiliation.\n“(The Oct. 12) forum is planned, organized and managed by Forever Tybee, a local Political Action Committee,” the letter reads. “That committee actively supports two candidates: Paul Wolff and Julie Livingston. It actively opposes the three of us, who have refused to take their loyalty oath, take their money, or accept their endorsement.”\nFriedman wrote that although he decided not to attend the forum, his initial responses to the Forever Tybee PAC’s policy questions are posted on that organization’s website, and he has provided opportunities for the public to contact him with questions through social media and his campaign website.\n“I receive questions very regularly from individual citizens about matters of concern to them about Tybee City government,” he wrote. “I respond to every one of them personally, thoughtfully and comprehensively.”\nBrown said Wednesday the reason he opted not to attend had less to do with fairness and more to do with civility.\n“I don’t have time to deal with people like that,” Brown said. “The Forever Tybee group controls the largest amount of members on every group we have down here. Why should I go in there and support Forever Tybee and their stupidity, when all along their main goal is to get rid of me and Wanda Doyle?”\nCandidate John Bremer later said he had intended to participate but was decided instead to stay by the side of a grieving friend.\nTybee politics\nAt this point in the campaign, the attacks have started to overpower what many of the council candidates have pinpointed as the issues affecting Tybee.\n“Unfortunately, Tybee can get pretty ugly when politics are involved,” Brown said.\nIf this year follows the same pattern as previous elections, Wolff said, observers can expect things to get even more heated closer to election day. His goal, he said, is to continue to focus on the true issues: traffic, litter, the future water supply and a proposal to build a public pool.\n“Tybee elections are always contentious. There’s always misinformation being spread by one side or another, and this campaign cycle seems to be as bad or worse than any campaign I’ve been involved with,” Wolff said.\nBremer said Tuesday he isn’t involved in any of the disputes involving council candidates or Forever Tybee. Instead, He said his focus is for everyone to work together for the betterment of the city.\n“I’m trying to stay above the fray,” Bremer said.\nBremer said his platform is common to many Coastal Georgia residents — cut back on the litter and be mindful of environmental issues. The road to Tybee Island needs attention, he said, whether it be candidate Julie Livingston’s proposal for better signs, a reduced speed limit or even a look at rail service.\nHe said his goal is not to unseat the incumbents, all of whom he considers friends, but to take his own shot at making a difference on the island.\n“I like everybody’s who running. I’d just like a chance, myself, to give it a try,” Bremer said. “I think any of us will have a chance. (But) I’m kind of worried if we get three versus three on that council, nothing will ever get done. I really hope when everything shakes out we’ve got a good group of people who are willing to work with the citizens of Tybee.”\nLivingston said she’s taking a similar approach. Although she’d previously observed Tybee politics from the outside, she said she’s still surprised by the mudslinging that has taken place.\nStill, she said, the majority of the island has stayed focused and avoided the mudslinging.\n“I came into this with the full intent of running on my own merit and absolutely avoiding being pulled into the chaos,” Livingston said Thursday. “I don’t believe this madness that goes on is indicative of what the people of Tybee are all about.”\nIF YOU GO\nWhat: Tybee Island Ethics Commission meeting\nWhen: 5 p.m. Wednesday\nWhere: Public Safety Building, 78 Van Horne St.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-24T18:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:11:32.936+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
