That's what being a human being is.\"\n\"Belief\" premieres Sunday at 8 p.m. EDT on Winfrey's network OWN. It took three years to produce as filmmakers trekked to various countries to capture people with varying perspectives and experiences with religion and spirituality.\n\"It's like a big ole community gathering around the world in a way that people just don't do on television, so I'm pleased that I was able to get it done,\" Winfrey said.\nThe event was attended by many of Winfrey's supporters and collaborators such as director Ava DuVernay, actor and recording artist Common and \"CBS This Morning\" co-host and Winfrey's long-time friend, Gayle King.\n\"This is a landmark series. It did for me what happened for me the first time I watched 'Roots,'\" said DuVernay. \"It changed what I thought my position was in the world. ... It really got me thinking about things and trying to understand things that I hadn't really delved into myself.\"\n___\nOnline:\nhttp://www.oprah.com/belief/Oprah-Winfrey-Presents-Belief \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
