Honoring the 100th birthday of the 20th century’s greatest entertainer, the show is set to unveil at 7:30 p.m. \n\nBrought to life with Grainger’s incredible vocal prowess that seamlessly channels ‘ole blue eyes’, the \"Sinatra Sintennial Show\" is reminiscent of the foot-tapping, finger-snapping enthusiasm of the swing era coupled with authentic Vegas glitz and glamour. The breathtaking production features a 17-piece live band, two back-up vocals, and beautifully adorned showgirls. No birthday celebration would be complete without “Happy Birthday” sung by the Blonde Bombshell herself. \n\nPerforming many of Sinatra’s most popular and classic hits, Grainger takes fans on a time-hopping journey set in an unforgettable evening filled with fan-favorite singles, fanciful musical arrangements, and a spectacular, mid-show surprise that is guaranteed to leave the audience breathless. Grainger, whose career has spanned from wedding singer to local Rat Pack member, has skyrocketed with his undeniable, marked ability to channel Sinatra’s singing and swagger. \n\n“Frank Sinatra’s legacy transcends the music industry and has left an indelible imprint upon the world in countless ways,” says Grainger. “As a longtime enthusiast of his music, I look forward to welcoming all of his fans from across Southwest Florida for a memorable evening together.” \n\nTickets can be purchased at www.Etix.com. Pricing starts at $35 per person. All guests will be delighted to discover they will receive a celebratory gift upon the conclusion of the evening: a delicious slice of Frank’s favorite birthday cake, locally crafted by Grandpa’s Bakery and based on the recipe that famed Patsy’s has officially shared with the show. Guests must be 21 years of age or older.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:40:02.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
