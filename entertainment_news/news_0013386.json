He was known as the \"Hello Kitty rapist\" because of a tattoo on his arm. A demented Florida man nicknamed the \"Hello Kitty rapist\" will spend the rest of his life locked behind bars.\nEdgar Collazo, 25, gained his signature title after authorities noticed the children's cartoon was tattooed on his arm. A jury convicted him in July for a series of attacks on women, going as far back as 2010. On Oct. 9, Circuit Judge Robert Egan gave Collazo four life sentences, on two counts of sexual assault and two counts of kidnapping. Collazo was also sentenced to an additional 37 years, for two counts of burglary, assault and robbery.\nDuring his trial, two of his victims testified about their terrifying encounter with Collazo.\nAn Afghanistan war veteran, fought back tears, and recalled how he held a knife to her neck after breaking into her apartment in 2010, News 13 reported.\n\"I wanted to be an engineer, I wanted to be a model, (and) do so many things differently than what I'm doing now. I depend on sleeping pills,\" a victim wrote in a letter, according to WESH.\nAnother victim, from a 2012 attack, was tied up after the \"Hello Kitty\" perv broke into her apartment and raped her roommate, prosecutors said.\n\"I hear (her) crying and saying, 'Please stop,'\" she said, according to WFTV. \"She must have said that 15 to 20 times.\"\nIn 2014, he tried to sexually assault a woman in an Orlando IHOP's parking lot, News 13 reported.\nThe serial rapist was finally caught after cops found his fingerprints on a Febreeze can, which prosecutors said he used to clean up after his attack. His DNA from the attempt in 2014 matched the DNA found from the 2012 rape, prosecutors said.\nThe \"Hello Kitty\" rapist will not be eligible for parole.\nang@nydailynews.com", "external_links": ["http://www.wesh.com/news/hello-kitty-rapist-to-be-sentenced-friday/35745922", "http://www.mynews13.com/content/news/cfnews13/news/article.html/content/news/articles/cfn/2015/7/8/edgar_collazo_trial_.html"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T21:59:22.736+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
