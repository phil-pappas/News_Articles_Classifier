He went “chomp chomp chomp” when Rashaun Sibley, playing a kid in a shark costume, urged the kids to repeat his words.\nHe lifted up his hands in delight to catch soap bubbles that floated out over the audience. It was hard to tell who was having more fun — Koltin, who has spina bifida, or his older brother and sister-in-law and their kids, 5-year-old Nathan and 2-year-old Natalie Kair.\nDallas Children’s Theater kicked off its sensory-friendly program with Go, Dog. Go! on March 1, 2014, collaborating with Autism Speaks and other experts. The company designated one performance of selected shows in its season to cater to children with sensory and developmental challenges, including autism. Now, thanks to being named a 2015 beneficiary of $564,400 from the Crystal Charity Ball, Fancy Nancy: The Musical was the first of what will be seven sensory-friendly performances of upcoming shows this season.\nThe sensory-friendly experience began an hour before the show started. The children were welcomed by assistants in white shirts who guided them gently at activity tables, including one where they could get their faces painted. Therapeutic clowns Slappy and Monday (Tiffany Riley and Dick Monday) got them laughing and dancing.\nDuring the show, house lights stayed on so the children weren’t frightened by darkness. The volume was turned down and flashing lights that are part of regular performances were eliminated. Two rows at the back were set aside for children who didn’t want interaction with the performers. There was no preshow speech asking for restless children to be escorted out. Children could talk or move around if they wished. Few did.\nAngelle Degruy, 12, of Sachse was excited to celebrate her upcoming Oct. 28 birthday at the theater with 11 friends ages 8-14. While most, like Angelle, have Down syndrome, some had other challenges. Angelle’s mother, Julie Degruy, appreciated being in a place where she didn’t have to worry about kids making noise.\n“She loved it!” Degruy said of her daughter after the show. “Everyone talked about what a great party it was. The kids all looked mesmerized during the play.”\nOne of Angelle’s guests, Kathy Mai, 15, lingered afterward, staring rapturously at the empty stage. When asked what she thought of the show, she said: “Perfect.”\nThen, hearing that her friends were meeting the actors in the lobby, she hurried out to get some hugs.\nSensory-friendly performances coming up:\nFeb. 20 at 1:30 p.m.\nA Year With Frog and Toad\nMarch 12 at 4:30 p.m.\nHansel and Gretel\nApril 9 at 1:30 p.m.\nhe Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane\nApril 23 at 1:30 p.m.\nBalloonacy\nMay 14 at 1:30 p.m.\nThe BFG (Big Friendly Giant)\nJuly 2 at 4:30 p.m.\nPinkalicious: The Musical\nDallas Children’s Theater at Rosewood Center for Family Arts, 5938 Skillman St., Dallas. $5 for sensory friendly performances. 214-740-0051. dct.org .\nReview: ‘Fancy Nancy’ delivers delights\nIt’s hard to imagine children not being delighted by Fancy Nancy: The Musical at Dallas Children’s Theater. Nancy (an exuberant Morgan Mabry) is so sure she’s going to get cast as the mermaid in the school dance that she’s practicing her dance steps in a glittery mermaid costume and seashell tiara. When things don’t turn out as she expects, her wise mother (a warm and reassuring Monique Abry) and good (and funny) friends (Jori Jackson, Lindsay Longacre, Olivia De Guzman Emile and Rashaun Sibley) help her realize you don’t have to be the star to shine.\nThe songs by Danny Abosch and Susan DiLallo are bouncy and smart with one song sung by Abry, “You’ll Always Be My Star,” sure to bring out a tear from any parent who has comforted a disappointed child. The dazzling, rich-hued sets by H. Bart McGeehon and costumes by Lyle Huchton are sure to tickle the fanciest of Nancys. Just when you think it’s over, director and choreographer Nancy Schaeffer has some swell interactive surprises involving balls, bubbles and fluttering sheets.\nWhile the performance reviewed was modified for children with special needs, the story, music, performances, set and costumes are the same.\nNancy Churnin\nPlan your life Fancy Nancy: The Musical continues through Sunday. $15-$28. Running time: 1 hour, 18 minutes.\nOn Twitter:\n @nchurnin", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/nchurnin"], "published": "2015-10-21T05:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:06:47.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
