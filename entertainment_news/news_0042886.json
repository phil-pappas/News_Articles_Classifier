This exhibition is the first-ever to showcase a vital aspect of the mid-century Modern Master’s art, his large-scale public mural projects. This exhibition headlines Art Basel season at the Frost Art Museum FIU, the international art fair draws more than 75,000 visitors. \nNine towering oil studies (each seven feet tall) are the show’s centerpieces , created by Hofmann for the famed 1950 project to re-design the Peruvian city of Chimbote (Hofmann’s visionary collaboration with Catalan architect Josep Lluís Sert that was never realized). The Chimbote Series and related architectural drawings and studies are presented thanks to the Trustees of the Renate, Hans and Maria Hofmann Trust. The exhibition also features several key paintings leading up to and following his murals. Hofmann is recognized worldwide as a leader in the evolution of Abstract Expressionism, both as an artist and as a celebrated teacher who influenced a generation of America’s most distinguished artists. “The whole world, as we experience it visually, comes to us through the mystic realm of color,” said Hans Hofmann. \nThe opening reception is free and open to the public on Saturday, Oct. 10 (4–7 p.m.). The museum is located at Florida International University, 10975 S.W. 17 St.. The Museum’s Steven and Dorothea Green Critics’ Lecture Series presents a lecture and Curator’s tour by Dr. Kenneth Silver , New York University Professor of Modern Art and Curator of this exhibition at the Bruce Museum in Greenwich, Connecticut (where Walls of Color originated before coming to the Frost), at 4:30 p.m. during the October 10th opening reception. (The lecture and Curator’s tour are also free and open to the public, but space is limited.) \n\n( Out of This World , 1945 by Hans Hofmann / Collection of the Patricia & Phillip Frost Art Museum FIU, Gift of Dr. Paul Lambert Schmitz) \n“Hans Hofmann was the linchpin for Abstract Expressionism, and the Frost Art Museum FIU is thrilled to bring this first-ever show about Hofmann’s mural works to Miami for Art Basel season,” said Dr. Jordana Pomeroy, the museum’s director. “Walls of Color will provide valuable context for the history of collaboration between architects, artists and developers. A touchstone in a city like Miami, with its historic MiMo and Art Deco architectural districts and the recent contemporary mural movement in Wynwood that serve as hallmarks of Miami’s success as a cultural destination.” “ This aspect of Hofmann’s career will shed light on the wide-ranging ambitions of one of the most seminal artists of the 20th century,” adds Dr. Pomeroy. \nThe German-born American artist (1880-1966) spent most of his life teaching in New York and Provincetown where he nurtured some of the most esteemed artists of the 20th century including: Lee Krasner, Larry Rivers, Joan Mitchell, Red Grooms, Ray Eames and Helen Frankenthaler. His push/pull spatial theories (the interdependent relationships between form, color and space) and innovative usage of color revolutionized the Abstract Expressionist movement. In 2015, Hofmann’s artwork Auxerre (1960) sold for $6,325,000 at auction at Christie’s New York, establishing a new world record for the artist. \n( Provincetown Docks , circa 1937 by Hans Hofmann / Collection of Drs. Mark and Elizabeth Rogers) \nThe exhibition at the Patricia & Phillip Frost Art Museum FIU features additional works exclusively on view only in Miami. These include the gouache-on-paper Out of this World (from the Frost Art Museum’s collection), the oil-on-panel Provincetown Docks (loaned by Miami-based collectors Drs. Mark and Elizabeth Rogers), and two other works-on-paper from the Frost’s collection, All Art Needs (Is) The Sperm Of France , and Untitled . The exhibition features a total of 36 artworks, featuring paintings, works on paper, collage, sketches, a light box, maquette and architectural rendering.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:30:08.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
