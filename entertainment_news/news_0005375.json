Telltale Games (TTG), an independent production studio based in San Rafael, CA that specializes in episodic graphic adventure games, has hired Erin King, a 2014 graduate of Ex’pression College’s Animation/Visual Effects program , as a Cinematic Artist. King is the tenth graduate of Ex’pression College to have been hired by TTG.\n“We have a great team at Telltale and I really love my co-workers,” says King, who animates cameras, composes shots and action sequences, and uses animation libraries to create characters. “As a student at Ex’pression, I played Telltale’s games and was impressed by how their stories were presented. I'm lucky to work with so many talented people who are dedicated to making our games great.”\nSince arriving at TTG, King has worked on “Game of Thrones”, \"Minecraft: Story Mode\", and “Tales from the Borderlands”. Other Ex’pression College graduates who have worked or currently work at the company include:\nAiryque Ervin ’07 (Animation/Video Effects program) Kathleen Willamson ’10 Animation/Video Effects program) Mike Sherak ’10 (Game Art Design program) Rogelio Gonzalez ’13 (Game Art Design program) Stephen Sideris ’05 (Digital Visual Media program) Calvin Huang Class ’10 (Game Art Design program) Ryan Chan Class ’07 (Animation/Video Effects program) Claudia Menjivar ’11 (Animation/Video Effects program)\n“Ex’pression has done an exceptional job of delivering top candidates to Telltale Games,” says Erik Ose, a Lead Environment Artist for TTG and a 2011 graduate of Ex’pression. “Even though we’ve also hired Ex’pression graduates for FX, environment, generalist, QA, and contract work, the talent for animation and choreographer-specific jobs has been especially dominant.”\nKing believes that Ex’pression’s curriculum prepared her well for her job at TTG.\n“The strength of an Ex'pression education is that it’s generalized and diverse, exposing students to many facets of the industry,” says King, who believes that hard work, continued learning, and self-promotion are essential to getting hired in the gaming industry. “I use what I learned about composition, timing, and acting on a daily basis. The school’s film-making classes piqued my interest in cinematography and camera technique.”\nAlong with “Game of Thrones” and “Tales from the Borderlands”, TTG’s other popular episodic games include “The Walking Dead”, “The Wolf Among Us”, “Back To the Future – The Game”, “Jurassic Park – The Game”, and “Poker Night 2”.\nAbout Ex’pression\nEx’pression College is a digital arts college in California’s San Francisco Bay Area, offering Bachelor of Applied Science degrees in Sound Arts, Interactive Audio, Graphic Design & Motion, Digital Filmmaking, Animation & Visual Effects, and Game Art & Design.
