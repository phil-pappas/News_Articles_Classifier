Fight the temptation to go for “easy money” and find a mentor who can steer you toward constructive activities and opportunities. The last time this happened, I asked the parent — nicely — to provide a small container that I could store in my fridge for the girl to use for her soy milk. The woman became irate, called me thoughtless and wouldn’t let her daughter come! I don’t know what I did wrong, but apparently I made some faux pas because the same thing happened with a different girl who wanted gluten-free everything. Abby, what should I do or say in these situations? I usually provide snacks and such that fit most diets, but a lot of times the main course contains gluten, dairy, etc., and I don’t want to go broke buying select types of food for one kid. Asking the mother to have her daughter bring a quart of soy milk with her was not rude, and the same is true for the mother of the girl who has an intolerance for gluten. The parents of children with food allergies should be used to the routine of providing allowable foods for them to bring when they will be eating away from home, and for you to have received the reaction you did was over the top.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T10:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:54:04.946+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
