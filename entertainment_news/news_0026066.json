Olsson will not reveal the cost of the violin she bought for Haveron, the SSO concertmaster. But the way Haveron loves the instrument goes way beyond matters of mere money.\nHe says the violin can, quite simply, “do anything”.\n“The instrument is letting you develop in ways that you didn’t know were possible.” he says. “I feel since getting hold of this particular instrument, which is by far the best instrument I’ve ever played on, that the ceiling is not fixed.”\nHaveron’s path towards having custody of the Guadagnini began earlier this year when Olsson decided it would be “a pretty good thing” to buy a violin for long-term loan to a member of the SSO.\n Her offer coincided with Haveron’s expressed desire to replace his 15-year-old instrument with something that would allow him to spread his wings as a musician. Haveron searched London for three weeks. It was “eerie and scary” that the very first violin he tried in London was the Guadagnini that he eventually chose for the purchase.\n“It seemed to know me, and I seemed to know it, but not well enough for it to be boring,” Haveron says.\nIt now remains for Haveron to discover something about the instrument’s background — not easy, since its immediate past owner is anonymous.\n“I would love to know who played it before, ” he says.\nSibelius 2: Robertson Conducts (including the Walton Violin Concerto), Concert Hall, Sydney Opera House; today 1.30pm, tomorrow 8pm, Saturday 2pm, $39-$126, sydneysymphony.com", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/84bbff6ab76cdb152e1bfacba74aca51", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/661d28ba08499db58de471efcb975ce8", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e0ecc9764913631058b7c705f58abf7d", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/66fa58f3fe82a85da51248d48a4fa31a", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ea6ca1a98282e6bba934db59ccd98576", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/7f9c8d60468fee74cfd347f61cd6227b", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-10-07T14:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:16:17.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
