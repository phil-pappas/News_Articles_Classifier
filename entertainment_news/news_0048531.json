The viewer sees in Jean Milu Truesdale's canvases his ability to capture strategic moments of time and space, while witnessing to his celebration of color.\nThe current collection may be viewed at Art Fusion Galleries from October 1- December 14, 2015 . Art Fusion Galleries hosts a Gala Opening Reception on Saturday, October 10th from 7-11 pm. Art Lovers are invited to enjoy the artwork along with live entertainment, hors d'oeuvres, refreshments, and valet parking. Art Miami / Basel is a perfect backdrop for Truesdale's work, which beautifully contrasts itself against a background of Street Art and Neo Modernist venues. His work transports one to a more peaceful time; to an almost forgotten era in painting.\nJean Milu Truesdale began his painting career in his early twenties when he left home with a backpack, a one-way ticket to Paris , and an easel. The young painter began a fifteen yearlong journey walking the paths, fields, and villages frequented by Van Gogh, Monet, Gauguin, and Pissaro. Jean Milu Truesdale became inspired by the landscapes, people, and Parisian cafes frequented by his predecessors.\nWhile living in Europe he developed his advanced use of color and light to create what he likes to call \"a dreamy darkness.\" Truesdale created a style influenced by the early impressionist movement capturing moments of time while he traveled the side roads and fields of Provence and Tuscany .\nDavid White , the Director at New Urban Art in Phoenix states that \"Everywhere in Truesdale's work you see precise visual thinking, excellent command of his medium, and strong color skills. Add power and creativity, and you have paintings that stimulate people's hearts, minds and imaginations.\"\nFor More Information Please Contact\nWilliam Braemer , Director\n(305)-573-5730\nInfo@ArtFusionGalleries.com\n3350 North Miami Avenue\nMiami, FL 33217\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151005/274115\n releases/jean-milu-truesdale-announces-collaboration-with-art-fusion-galleries-300154447.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.artfusionartists.com/artist-profile-2015.php?code=1005&page=1", "https://www.facebook.com/events/1041969362510340/", "http://www.artfusiongalleries.com/", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151005/274115", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/jean-milu-truesdale-announces-collaboration-with-art-fusion-galleries-300154447.html", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151005/274115", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=AQ20321&Transmission_Id=201510060811PR_NEWS_USPR_____AQ20321&DateId=20151006"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T17:50:35.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
