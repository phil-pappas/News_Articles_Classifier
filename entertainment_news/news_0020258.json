Well, it is. The level of outrageousness of course is up to you to decide, depending on whether you're a die-hard fan of the original cartoon series or curious about this Jem character and why she has her own film. Cosmopolitan.com recently spoke to star Aubrey Peeples, an actress whose proven singing chops (if you're not watching her on Nashville , you're seriously missing out), enthusiasm, and industry savvy are a great fit for the role. Cosmopolitan.com's conversation with Peeples included a wide range of topics, like why she thinks Jem is a role model for young women and men, how she's dealing with haters, and how she strives to be body positive in an industry that isn't.\n I read that you did your homework, studied the character and the series. What was it you liked most from the original and what from that did you bring into this version?\nWhat's so nice about the original is that it offers something about empowerment to young kids. It was very ahead of its time, especially the fact that it was led by four females — that's awesome. I think there are not as many movies led by four females as there should be.​ Of course the music and all that and the messages from the original series we brought with us, but we just wanted to break down the characters and look at their rise to fame a little bit more.\nMore From Cosmopolitan What have you liked most about the Jem fan community?\nFirst of all, being a part of something that's been loved for so many years, there is pressure that comes with that, taking on that role, but the community is so loving, at least toward the original series. They are so passionate, it has such a big cult following. Of course we've gotten a lot of hate already just because we're not doing the same thing. I feel like if we were going to replicate the series, it would never be as good because it was already amazing.\nI do think there is a huge portion of the fans that are super excited to see it and the lot of them are actually involved with the film; some of them traveled from as far as Australia to be a part of the audience of our performances. For \"Young Blood,\" we did this social media blast like, \"Hey, if you want to see a performance, come be in the audience,\" and we got, like, 400 people. There is a guy named Mike Waters who is obsessed and he posts a picture in a Jem sweatband every day, he's so fabulous, he's in the audiences for different performances throughout the film. ​\nWhat's the best piece of advice you've gotten from someone in the business when it comes to dealing with hate?\nI don't know if it's from anyone in the business, but something I've learned over time is it's very important to keep a strong head on your shoulders and not worry about what you look like as long as you're healthy, because often times there will be a lot of hate online, and even from media or people trying to steer you in the wrong direction or to make you look a certain way. It's really important to stay true to who you are and be healthy.\nI think that media and what's out there now can really make young girls and young boys really self conscious.\nShare Tweet How do you do that?\nIt takes a while. It's about learning what's important and what's not important, and at the end of the day, what size you are does not matter at all. I don't have time to worry about that stuff, I'm going to be healthy. Plus, I have a great support system — my family is really supportive and my friends as well.\nDo you find that with age, that's something that becomes easier?\nYeah, I think so, but it's actually unfortunate. I think that media and what's out there now can really make young girls and young boys really self-conscious. I think, yes, it takes time to learn that, but I also think I don't know if we lived in a different society, if it would take as much time to figure it out. There are a lot of pros and cons about social media, it's just how you choose to handle it and how you have to be prepared for the negatives as well. I'm so fascinated by YouTube culture. I have no idea how it's working, but more and more people are becoming Internet famous and it is because it allows you to have an atmosphere in which you feel comfortable to be yourself, which you might not get otherwise.\nWhat are you most proud of in embodying this character and bringing her to the big screen?\nI'm proud of being a part of something that I think is an edgier, more relevant alternative for this preteen and younger kid generation. A lot of the things that are out there for young kids don't tap into how they are dealing with social media and don't tap into real issues like that. Things for kids can often be sugarcoated, and while this is a family, wholesome movie, it's also very grounded and more relevant.\nJem and the Holograms opens in theaters Oct. 23.\n​Follow Kara on Twitter .", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/karawarner?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/1600x800/landscape-1445637027-gettyimages-479004564.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-24T01:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:14:38.946+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
