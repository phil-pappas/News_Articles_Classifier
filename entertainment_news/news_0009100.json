I don't think I've ever worked for a man in charge who spent time contemplating what angle he should use to have his voice heard. It's just heard.\" \nSchumer is also writing a comedy screenplay with Lawrence in which the pair play sisters. Schumer and Lawrence became friends this year, with Schumer sharing photos of the pair holidaying in the Hamptons.
