Jonathan Biss, one of the busiest piano soloists in the world, comes to the UW World Series on Oct. 20 with Mozart, Schumann and a Schoenberg concerto he describes as “a sorbet.” By Tom Keogh Special to The Seattle Times \nThe last time pianist Jonathan Biss performed in Seattle — in June 2014 — he played Arnold Schoenberg’s 1942 Piano Concerto with the Seattle Symphony Orchestra. \nAt the time, he described it as a “beautiful” and “prickly” piece that “lives at a high emotional temperature with extremes of passion and moments of great delicacy.” \nContrast that assessment with Biss’ description of Schoenberg’s “Sechs kleine Klavierstücke (Six Little Piano Pieces),” a set for solo piano and a sharp departure from the composer’s previous symphonic repertoire. Concert Preview Jonathan Biss \n7:30 p.m. Tuesday, Oct. 20, Meany Theater, University of Washington, Seattle; $41-$46 (206-543-4880 or uwworldseries.org ) \n“It’s sort of a sorbet,” Biss says. “These are tiny pieces that take about six minutes to play.” Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. \nBiss will perform “Sechs kleine Klavierstücke” on Tuesday (Oct. 20) in his first appearance at Meany Theater in a decade. If this particular Schoenberg offering is akin to sherbet, that’s only because it will serve as a palate cleanser between two challenging Mozart sonatas. \nYet Biss considers the work “the essence of Schoenberg, pared to essentials. There’s an incredible amount of expressive detail in very little time. It’s an expressionistic piece, a great reminder there’s nothing cold about his music. It’s deeply felt.” \nThe Mozart selections are the Sonatas in C Minor and F Major, which Biss calls “extraordinary. These are two of the finest sonatas. The G Minor is a relentlessly dramatic piece with terrible intensity. The F Major is contemplation. It almost has a philosophical quality to it.” \nThe final work in the Meany program, Schumann’s “Kreisleriana,” is an eight-movement composition written over four days in April 1838. \n“It’s very dear to me,” Biss says. “I’ve played it since I was 15 years old. I was completely obsessed with it, and I come back to it periodically. Schumann wrote it in a mad rush, which is un­believable. It was a kind of outpouring, and you can feel that. There is extreme emotion, but as with everything by Schumann, there is poetry.” \nBiss, 35, is among the busiest of soloists, not only maintaining a full concert schedule but juggling several long-term, multiyear projects that demand complete immersion. In 2011, Biss began recording all 32 of Beethoven’s sonatas, which he has called “one of the most profound experiences of my life.” \nBiss plans to be done with the recordings in 2020 and begin performing all the pieces in a cycle. But there’s more: When this project began, Biss started teaching at Philadelphia’s Curtis Institute of Music and his lectures on Beethoven’s sonatas were picked up by Coursera, which collaborates with schools to offer free online classes. \nThose lectures have been viewed by over 80,000 online students. \nBiss’ Kindle Single book, “Beethoven’s Shadow,” covers the same ground. What is it like to be so wrapped up in one branch of one composer’s repertoire? \n“The fact that I’m dealing with this music on such a large scale means I’m constantly aware of how big it is, what it’s addressing, and what it’s about,” he says. “It’s allowed me to delve into detail. There’s no limit to how deep into the nitty-gritty I can get. The thing that is amazing about the Beethoven sonatas is how much humanity they encompass.” \nBiss is also the driving force behind “Schumann Under the Influence,” a series of international concerts pairing Schumann works with those of his influences (Beethoven, Purcell) and those inspired by him (Alban Berg, Timo Andres). \n“I’m a professional musician, and it’s a wonderful life,” he says. “But the lifestyle of going from place to place and simply playing concerts can be a bit stultifying. Eventually you can feel you’re on the treadmill. I’m much happier when I can think of the work I do as exploration, and when I play concerts I can share the results of those explorations.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:20:48.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
