This type of unauthorised access is a crime and unfortunately, cybercrime is a persistent threat in today’s world. Despite our best efforts, no business is immune and we sincerely apologise that this has occurred.”\nDavid Jones reported the hack to the Australian Federal Police, Attorney-General’s department and the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (formerly known as the Privacy Commissioner).\nThe company does not retain shoppers’ credit card information and stores personal data only where necessary for the ordinary course of business, guided by its privacy policy .\n“There is no evidence the data has been misused,” David Jones said.\n“We are committed to making this right and are taking action to reduce the likelihood of this happening again. We are reviewing our systems, security measures and working with expert security consultants. Protecting our customers is of paramount importance to us.”\nThe statement also warned customers to be on the lookout for “unsolicited phone calls or emails that appear to be sent by David Jones” and ask for personal information.\n“David Jones will not be calling individuals in relation to this matter unless expressly requested to do so by you.”\nCustomers with concerns are invited to email David Jones’ privacy team .\ndana.mccauley@news.com.au\n@Dana_Adele Five things you didn't know could get hacked 2:33 Play video\nHackers aren't always after personal information.
