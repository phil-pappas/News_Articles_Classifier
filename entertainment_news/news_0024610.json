The experience has to be something great, or of course, people don’t want to come.” \nNolan was joined by the visual artist Tacita Dean during the debate, which was the first of a new LFF Connects series at the festival.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T09:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:08:26.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
