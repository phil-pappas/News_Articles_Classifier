The company has a professional and safety conscious team with over two decades experience, working with top-brand equipment and high-tech solutions including computer-controlled cable-suspended camera systems.\nThe company is led by Alex Wurfel and Rene Karnahl, both with a deep well of knowledge and experience in event production. \"We are excited about all the opportunities in the PRG Alliance,\" says Wurfel. \"We are happy to share our expertise in the field of rigging with the members and have their support on lighting and audiovisual services as we want to expand our business in this area; we see it as having access to a huge inventory and wealth of experience overnight. This partnership is even more significant for me because I started my career on Procon's lighting and rigging technical team. I am looking forward to work together with them again.\"\n\"PRG is very familiar with the work of ES:ME and their expertise in complex structural installations for event production,\" says Tom Van Hemelryck , Director of the PRG Alliance. \"We worked together on a number of projects, including the Oman National Day and the Burj Khalifa Opening. They are very strict in following the highest European and American standards and their support to the Alliance is very welcome – we want to reinforce the importance of safety to our members.\"\nThe collaboration started right away with ES:ME providing a workshop to all members on International Standards in Rigging during PRG Alliance regional events that were held in Sao Paulo , Hamburg , and Shanghai during August and September 2015 .\nThe PRG Alliance today has members in 24 countries – the complete list of participant companies and news are available on Alliance website: www.prgalliance.com .\nFor more information about the PRG Alliance, please go to: www.prgalliance.com .\nFor more information about PRG, please go to: www.prg.com .\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151002/273454LOGO\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151002/273455\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/prg-alliance-announces-its-new-member-in-qatar-300153455.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/prg-alliance-announces-its-new-member-in-qatar-300153455.html", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151002/273454LOGO", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151002/273455", "http://www.prgalliance.com/", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151002/273454LOGO", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=NY18582&Transmission_Id=201510021257PR_NEWS_USPR_____NY18582&DateId=20151002", "http://www.prg.com/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151002/273455"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:57:35.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
