Or more likely, both have belatedly recognized that mutual self-interest is the way TV really works. \nThat's right -- the presidential hopeful and longtime \"Apprentice\" terminator-in-chief is coming home, and this time, he'll host \"Saturday Night Live\" on Nov. 7, his first return to Studio 8H since 2004. Most popular Photos 40 favorite 'SNL' cast members Photos Donald, Ivanka and the Trump family \nNBC might even agree with that assessment. \nThe timing -- coming on the afternoon of the first Democratic debate -- is certainly noteworthy. Also, Nov. 7 is just a few days after local elections around the country, so at least there's a putative hook for this hosting appearance, as if there needs to be one for Trump. \nIn some ways, this is yuge, and symbolically so. A return to \"SNL' is certainly a bigger deal than a return to \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\" where he appeared last month, or to \"Today,\" where he has continued to maintain a presence, as he has with Fox News (which he also threatened to boycott, if memory serves). \n  \nThe symbolism of this move is what counts most. To host \"SNL\" means you are either a hot commodity (Amy Schumer), a hugely newsworthy personage (Hillary Clinton), or one of the world's biggest stars. \nInstead, Trump is simply Trump, which (in some ways) is all three. The leading GOP candidate among twelve who have declared a run for the White House, he is without question one of the true ratings magnets of modern times. If at least by \"modern times\" one means since declaring his candidacy. The GOP debates set records for Fox and CNN, and clearly NBC wants a little bit of that ratings sugar too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T22:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:07:41.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
