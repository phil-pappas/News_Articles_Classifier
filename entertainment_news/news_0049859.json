There's £250,000 up for grabs, with the stand-up playing for Helen & Douglas House, a charity shop that raises money for a children's hospice, a great cause. The new addition of the chance to double/lose all of your money at the end adds even more excitement to a game that literally has no skill, or formula, no matter how much Noel Edmunds tries to say contrary. It'll be strange to see Carr out of the host's chair, but we're sure he'll be great as always. Best of luck, Jimmy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T18:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:47:21.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
