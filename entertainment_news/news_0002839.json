It also took 1,600 gallons of paint to bring back its sparkle. \nThe pavilion has been mostly closed to visitors, but this weekend Parks officials will be offering tours of the closed-off site as part of Open House New York. \nThe pavilion will be open Saturday, Oct. 17 and Sunday, Oct. 18 from 1 p.m. until 5 p.m. Officials expect big lines, but said no one will be turned away from getting a peak inside. \nThere will also be tours of other World's Fair sites around the park. \nOfficials at Thursday's ribbon cutting also announced the start of a $650,000 design contract to figure out the electrical and structural needs for the pavilion's adjacent observation towers. \nPoliticians and officials cut the ribbon outside the New York State Pavilion.
