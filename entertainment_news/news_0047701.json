Here in the Southwest we don't see many burros and so we forget the incredible role they played in getting early settlers here and then supporting all those early interests, from agriculture to delivering supplies and mail.\nAnd bats? They're shy, fascinating creatures! Most people are scared of bats - too many horror movies feature bats as villains! - but they play an incredible role in nature by eating insects harmful to people and crops. In Asia they're revered and a sign of good luck. Here? Not so much.\"\nTritscheller's bronze sculptures, represented locally by the Giacobbe Fritz Gallery, range from table-top size to larger-than-life. One of her biggest pieces - a massive, standing burro - is stationed outside of the Giacobbe Fritz Gallery on Canyon Road and is one of the most tourist-photographed pieces of sculpture on a road known around the world for incredible, one-of-a-kind art.\nSome of Tritscheller's art is also spending time traveling around the world in the months to come. Multiple pieces of Tritscheller's work are being featured at the Shanghai Art Fair November 12-15 and, during Miami's famous \"Art Week,\" one of the artist's newer pieces, \"Seashell Bat,\" is being featured at the Spectrum Miami Art Show December 2-6.\nTritscheller, a Georgia native, splits her time between homes in Santa Fe and Thailand. She uses her New Mexico time for \"creative think time\" and modeling work for new pieces and her time in Thailand for overseeing the casting and patination of the final bronzes.\n\"New Mexico allows me to see things differently - differently than anywhere else in the world - and there's enough 'space' here to work things through both in my head and when working with clay. I've lived and traveled all over the world but I've discovered over time that there's something about New Mexico that simply inspires me as nowhere else does.\"\nBesides Santa Fe's Giacobbe Fritz, Tritscheller's work is represented by galleries in Napa, Shanghai, Taipei and the Maldives.\nwww.coppertritscheller.com\nNote to Media: Both high-res and low-res JPGs of Ms. Tritscheller's work are available for reproduction upon request.
