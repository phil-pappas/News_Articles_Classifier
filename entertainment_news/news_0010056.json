Photo: Pat Scala \nEight days before they're due to perform their biggest ever solo gig at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl, Hugo Gruzman​ and James Lyell of Sydney electronic duo Flight Facilities are still coming to terms with the magnitude of the task ahead.\nOn Saturday night, they will perform at the Bowl with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra to a crowd of 12,000.\nIt's the first time their work has been adapted for orchestra, an idea spawned by the Melbourne Festival's director of contemporary music, Declan Forde.\n\"We kind of have to give the credit to his vision to see us as someone who could pull this off,\" Gruzman says.\nAdvertisement \"I bet he could have picked a number of different bands. I'm so glad he picked us,\" Lyell says.\n\"It's a big task and it's been daunting, but I'm so glad we were given the opportunity.\"\nForde's choice proved an astute one: the show sold out in three hours.\nThe popularity of Flight Facilities has soared in the past three years, largely thanks to a series of mixtapes recorded for triple j, chronicling the past four decades in dance music, and the release of their studio album,  Down to Earth , late last year.\nThey've performed at Glastonbury and Coachella, but never live with a symphony orchestra. Neither Lyell nor Gruzman has a background in classical music, though they share an appreciation for it. One of the tracks on  Down to Earth  is called  Clair de Lune .\n\"We've always spoken about getting string sections for songs, we've got quite a few songs that involve it,\" Gruzman says. \nDavide Rossi, a string arranger and composer who has worked with Coldplay, Goldfrapp and The Verve, was enlisted to help convert the dance tracks into orchestral pieces.\nThe pair have found the process surprisingly painless.\n\"You send the original song to him with all its parts, he reinterprets it with an orchestra, sees which bits could be substituted out and which bits could be left as they are, and then it's a kind of [a] push and pull thing where we're like, we love this, let's take out this . . . but he's so clever and has such an idea of what we want that nothing was really that hard to achieve in the end,\" Gruzman says.\n\"We're stoked to be able to work with a guy with that much talent,\" Lyell says.\nSaturday night will also mark the first time the duo has performed live with instruments, rather than from behind the decks.\n\"It's great to go from DJing and sampling to being a part of the band and the rest of the orchestra,\" Lyell says.\n\"The scariest part of it is playing alongside people who are the best at what they do,\" Gruzman says.\n\"Hugo's playing piano on a couple of tracks,\" Lyell says.\nAsked if he plays piano, Gruzman snorts.\n\"No! I do now.  We've been practising so much, as long as I can get it right for the tracks I play, I'll be fine.\n\"'I'll be fine' is what I'm going to keep saying for the next eight days, I think.\"\nThe talented line-up of guest vocalists joining Flight Facilities on Saturday night includes Katie Noonan, Brooke Addamo​ (Owl Eyes) and Emma Louise, but sadly, no Kylie Minogue.\nMinogue performed a reprise of hit Crave You on Down to Earth .\nA light installation from French company Chevalvert will ensure the show is as impressive visually as it is aurally.\n\"It's like tracking a sound visually in a way,\" Gruzman says.\n\"We don't think anyone in Australia has done it yet. Hopefully, it blows minds.\"\nFlight Facilities and the MSO play Sidney Myer Music Bowl on Saturday, October 17. The concert will also be streamed live from Federation Square from 8pm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T13:19:43.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
