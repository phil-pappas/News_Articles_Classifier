A couple is suing Apple after they received an astronomical bill because of Wi-Fi Assist.\nOn Friday, plaintiffs William Scott Phillips and Suzanne Schmidt Phillips have filed a $5 million class-action lawsuit against Apple alleging that the Wi-Fi Assist feature on the iPhone resulted in data overcharges, Apple Insider reported .\nIn the complaint — filed in U.S. District Court in San Jose, Calif. — the Cupertino-based company is accused of negligent misrepresentation, and breaching California's Unfair Competition Law and False Advertising Law.\nAPPLE ADDS SUPPORT PAGE TO PROVE IOS 9 WI-FI ASSIST IS NOT EATING UP USERS' DATA\nA screenshot of the Wi-fi Assist enabled on the iPhone. The new feature on iOS 9 is enabled by default after installing Apple's operating system on iPhone 5 models or later.\nWi-Fi Assist automatically switches your device to cellular data usage when there is a weak wireless connection.\nWhen the feature is turned on, users may \"use more cellular data,\" but that \"this should only be a small percentage higher than previous usage,\" according to Apple's website .\nFor the Phillips, that update on the company website was not good enough.\n\"Defendant's above corrective action, however, still downplays the possible data overcharges a user could incur,\" the suit argues.\n\"Reasonable and average consumers use their iPhones for streaming of music, videos, and running various applications — all of which can use significant data. Defendant's corrective statement does not disclose any basis for its conclusion that an average consumer would not see much increase in cellular usage.\"\nCLICK HERE TO FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK\nCLICK HERE TO FOLLOW US ON TWITTER\nkcasino@nydailynews.com", "external_links": ["http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/10/23/lawsuit-accuses-apples-ios-9-wi-fi-assist-feature-of-burning-through-5m-in-data", "http://www.twitter.com/nydailynews", "http://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews", "https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205296"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:30:56.743+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
