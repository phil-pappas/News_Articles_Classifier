Last year, it produced just 7,255 cars.\nBut Ferrari spun off as a public company on Wednesday, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the altogether appropriate ticker symbol RACE.\nSo the long-term question for it — or any publicly traded company — is whether it can outrun Wall Street investors rarely satisfied with a golden goose's output if they think there's more gold to be had.\nBecause, as anyone who's ever worked for a public company knows, Wall Street investors always think there's more gold to be had.\nWhen all is said and done, Italy's Agnelli family will have a roughly 25 percent stake and Piero Ferrari, son of founder Enzo Ferrari, will have 10 percent. Ferrari shares are a lot more affordable and accessible than Ferrari cars, however, even with an opening day price bump of nearly 6 percent, closing at $55.\nFerrari goes public with RACE on NYSE Tribune wire reports Ferrari roared onto the New York Stock Exchange and its shares, trading under the ticker symbol RACE, jumped sharply Wednesday in their public debut.\nThe company, based in the northern Italian town of Maranello, has been privately held since its founding in 1929 by Italian sports driver Enzo Ferrari.\n... Ferrari roared onto the New York Stock Exchange and its shares, trading under the ticker symbol RACE, jumped sharply Wednesday in their public debut.\nThe company, based in the northern Italian town of Maranello, has been privately held since its founding in 1929 by Italian sports driver Enzo Ferrari.\n... (Tribune wire reports) Shareholders as a rule, early on and in good times, will always give lip service to the value of a company's brand, its reputation, the quality of its workforce and product or service, and the unique way it does whatever it does.\nBut the first time that company doesn't make its numbers or makes some other miscalculation, no matter how small, management is called to account.\nIt doesn't take long for talk of changes to reverse a trend or preserve a margin to start. Soon there's pressure to contain costs, whether through workforce reductions or changes in how and/or where work is done.\nThe board of directors, charged with looking out for protecting investors' holdings rather than protecting the brand and the product behind it, look to company executives to do whatever's necessary to service the share price on which their bonuses are based.\nIf there's no way to grow the company organically, mergers are eyed for the bump and shake-up they produce, and the company can look like something altogether different than whatever was so appealing to investors in the first place.\nWell, as the ghosts tried to teach Scrooge, that's what can happen, anyway, if greediness continues unchecked. The future can change.\nFor years, Ferrari has made the cars it wanted at the price it wanted and banked on limited supply to enhance demand.\nIts business model was closer to Picasso than Pontiac, and Ferrari collectors have paid fine-art prices to match.\nDespite being a relatively small automaker among the thousands to produce vehicles over the last 100-plus years, a Gizmag.com report earlier this year noted that Ferraris have accounted for nine of the top 10 most-expensive autos ever sold at auction, 14 of the top 20, 30 of the top 50, 53 of the top 100.\nA 1963 Ferrari 250 GTO last year sold for $34.65 million, not counting the buyer premium.\nCapping production has served its luxury niche brand well to this point, if not maximizing revenue then sustaining it and what it does so well.\nThough it slipped this year to ninth place, Ferrari last year was deemed the most powerful brand in the world by the consultancy Brand Finance, which cited the \"cultish, even quasi-religious devotion\" its limited production has nurtured. It mattered not that the approach meant its revenue was dwarfed by other companies.\nSergio Marchionne, Fiat Chrysler's CEO and Ferrari's chairman, told CNBC on Wednesday that preserving the brand's rarity is vital to preserving the company's value.\n\"What is at the heart of the brand is this intimate relationship between us and the customer base,\" Marchionne said. \"Therefore it would be almost suicidal to try to expand volumes to the detriment of that relationship.\"\nBut going public threatens to add a lot of back-seat drivers, regardless of whether there's an actual back seat.\nThe first time it hits a bump or someone insists there's a better route to take, we'll see how Ferrari holds the road.\nMargin call: President John Kennedy 53 years ago Thursday, in what the Tribune called \"a dramatic and perhaps fateful radio-television address to the nation,\" announced a U.S. naval quarantine of Cuba in response to the Soviet Union's buildup of offensive nuclear missiles there. Yeah.
