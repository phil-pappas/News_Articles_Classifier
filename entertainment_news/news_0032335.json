By India.com Entertainment Desk on October 23, 2015 at 3:07 AM Comments \nJohn Abrham has been in the news for not quite good reasons.

The actor despite being advised a month of bed rest, is working under the guidance of a physiotherapist and will be back on his feet in no time. \nSources close to the actor reveal that John will resume shooting for Dishoom in the second week of November in Mumbai. John has been in excruciating pain since his knee was badly injured but has been working hard on his recovery since he doesn’t want the Dishoom team to reschedule their dates. \nThe actor’s injury has not affected the shoot schedule of the film and he is determined to come back better than ever for the action entertainer’s second schedule. \n  3:16 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:12:58.742+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
