Southern Goods earns an enthusiastic A 1 / 1 Back to Gallery I knew I had to try the burger at Southern Goods the moment I saw the beef cuts being fed into a grinder to make the patties.\nFrom the bar counter of this new Heights hot spot, you can see the tall grinder at the back of the semi-open kitchen. That space is jumping with talented cooks who've been chefs in their own right. There's head man Lyle Bento, who's cooked at Underbelly and Feast; and Patrick Feges, the barbecue entrepreneur who helped Ronnie Killen open Killen's Barbecue in Pearland; and J.D. Woodward, the chef at the late Goro & Gun, whose astonishing Phat Ass Ham Hock was one of the best dishes of 2013.\nThat's a lot of talent. So I expected a lot from the burger. Let's take a bite:\nOrdering: Take a seat at the counter if you can find one. (Better get there early because this month-old spot is the new Heights darling, and there is often a wait.) Or sit at one of the dining-room tables. A server will take your order.\nPrice: The double-meat, double-cheese SG Burger goes for $14 and includes a side of potato salad. Add a beer from the extensive tap wall for $6 to $8, which will bring your tab into the low 20s.\nArchitecture: Salad stuff on top. On a poufy, aggressively griddle-toasted \"salt and pepper bun\" goes two plump beef patties, each draped in a melt of cheddar cheese. That's one side of the plate. To the other, the second bun half is layered with iceberg leaves, slices of tomato, rings of red onion and a clutch of house-made bread-and-butter pickles. To the side is a tiny ramekin of pinkish mayo-based \"Comeback Sauce\" to add at will.\nQuality: \"Wow\" would be the applicable word. I've never been a double-patty person because while the potential for nice crusty sear is doubled, so is the potential for the necessarily thinner-style patties to be overcooked. Not here. The interiors of the taller-than-expected patties were flushed with medium-rare rose, so that the juices stayed intact.\nThe rest of the ingredients were spectacular, too, from the really ripe, red tomato to the perfectly applied sharp cheese to the snap of the pickles, onion and lettuce. The Comeback Sauce had a nice little Southern kick to it, but this is one of those rare burgers that can stand on its own without condiment help.\nOoze rating: Good. Juices may not gush forth, but they seethe around inside the patties.\nBonus points: An extensive and interesting tap wall of beers from local, national and international craft brewers nicely rounds out the burger experience.\nMinus points: Inevitably, some burger traditionalists will lament the lack of french fries on the plate. Personally, I found the frisky potato salad an interesting addition: It gave the plate a backyard-picnic feel that worked for me.\nLocal color: Somehow, despite the crowds, this brand-new spot manages to seem both relaxed and lived-in. The service is friendly, the vibe at the bar is congenial, and when the big windows open up for service on the dining terrace outside, you can see the potential for Southern Goods to become a much-loved institution. Managing partner Charles Bishop - who launched Cottonwood and Liberty Station before selling his interest to concentrate on this project - has plans for awnings to be installed over the dramatic, angled steel beams on the terrace; and eventually to host live music in the space out back.\nDon't leave without taking a good, long look at the vintage Gulf Coast memorabilia papering the back corridor. Everything from handwritten recipes to antique oilfield equipment ads lines the narrow space. It's like wandering into some eccentric museum.\nGrade: A", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/12/8716973/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/12/8716973/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-30T19:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:29:07.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
