There have been instances where homeowners have selected paint colors without considering any of the factors below and their home stood out negatively in their neighborhoods. \nLamudi Ghana has compiled the following crucial points to consider when selecting colors for the exterior of your building. There are three main types of paint colors used for the exterior of a building: the dominant one for walls of the building, the accent which is used for the doors and shutters and trim colors for the windows. Here are a few tips to help you select the right ones: \n1. What structures do you have in your neighborhood? You would not want your home to be too different from the others. Take a walk in the neighborhood and look at the other buildings and observe how they have painted their structures before selecting yours. \n2. What do you have in your immediate surrounding? Nature can be one of the most important determinants of the paint colors you use for your exterior. Painting a color which is close to a forest in the same green shade will hide your building. In such instances, a shade of brown or cream will make your house stand out. \n3. Consider the architectural style. The design of the building should also be taken into account to find the right paint colors. For instance, townhouses are mostly painted brown. To make your house stand out, you can use very bright colors for the doors and windows. \n4. The climate type. Ghana is located in the tropics and experiences both rain and sunny conditions, you do not want to select very bright colors that will fade off shortly afterwards. General Manager of City Paints Supply Carl Kharter advises: “Some paints last for a year, others two or three years and this depends on the brand and colors. Bright colors fade easily away and lighter colors last longer, so it is advisable to select light colors for the exterior.” \n5. The brand of paint. The brand of paint also determines how long it will last on the building. Cheap and bad quality paints will fade and peel within a year after applying it. “You can apply any color to the exterior of your building depending on the brand; the brand and the pigment are very important,” says Kharter. \nModern colors are used by a lot of home buyers and they include white, light ivory, grey, and lemonade.
