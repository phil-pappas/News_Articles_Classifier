Their motion has been sealed from public view, and neither side would describe the evidence. \nJudge Jeffrey Locke is expected to hear arguments during a hearing Tuesday. \nHernandez is accused of following the men, then opening fire as they sat in their car at a stop light. He has pleaded not guilty. \nHernandez was convicted in a separate murder earlier this year and is serving a life sentence.
