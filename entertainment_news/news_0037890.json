Block and Ryan Silverman, both of whom took the weekend off from their current Broadway gigs to join the MSO Pops for the weekend's performances. \nThe program reached back 70 years to \"Carousel\" and included selections from Broadway staples such \"South Pacific\" and \"The King and I.\" \nBlock, who moved effortlessly between a polished, flowing legit sound and a powerhouse belt, delivered a fiery \"Don't Rain on My Parade\" from \"Funny Girl\" as well as a sweet, touching \"Meadowlark\" from \"The Baker's Wife.\" She delivered an absolutely roof-raising rendition of \"Defying Gravity,\" sung by Elphaba in \"Wicked, a role she has played on Broadway. \nSilverman gave high, pure sounds and intimate deliveries to such tunes \"The Streets of Dublin\" from \"A Man of No Importance,\" to a captivating world-in-a-song rendition of \"Being Alive\" from \"Company,\" and a classy \"What Kind of Fool am I?\" from \"Stop the World – I Want to Get Off.\" \nBetween selections in what Reineke joking called \"the love portion\" of the program, a man named Timothy Koelbl stepped walked onto the stage with a microphone. Much to the delight of the audience, he dropped to one knee and proposed to Michelle Roche, who was seated in the front row. \nShe said yes. The event won cheers and applause, as did Block and Silverman's touching rendition of version of \"If I Loved You\" from \"Carousel.\" \nA well-constructed program, fine singing and nicely crafted orchestral renditions were no match for overamplification and poor balance. At one point a strumming guitar buried all of the orchestral strings, later nearly drowning out a trumpet solo. \nSingers' lyrics and many of their vocal nuances, particularly on the most intimate selections on the program, were blurred or lost in the heavily amplified sound of the orchestra, prompting patron conversations with ushers during intermission. \nThe MSO's \"On Broadway\" will be repeated at 8 p.m. Saturday and 2:30 p.m. Sunday at the Marcus Center, 929 N.
