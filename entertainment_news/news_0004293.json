BABCOCK If I had to title this piece I would name it, “Taxation Through Imagination.” I am writing this to bring attention that there are laws, procedures and methods which are legal, but they are not necessarily just. A good example of this is in the controversial Supreme Court ruling of Kelo vs. New London. This ruling gave the government expanded eminent domain powers to seize private property to allow economic development.\nWhile appealing the Fair Market Value (FMV) of my 14-year-old manufactured home, I discovered the Chatham County Tax Assessor’s Office was using a method that is legal and I do not consider just.\nThe first of the year, 2015, I received my usual tax notice on a manufactured mobile home I owned. Chatham County has been increasing the FMV on this home since 2012 and I decided to look into the reason why. I called the CCBA (Chatham County Board of Assessors) and asked what method they use to assess manufactured homes. I was told Marshall and Swift.\nI called the Georgia Manufactured Housing Association and a Manufactured Home Dealer and asked them their preferred method to assess used homes. I was told they use The NADA (National Automobile Dealers Association). Having never heard of Marshall and Swift, I went to their website and read the following statement. The commercial and residential replacement costs relied upon real estate professionals, government agencies, corporations and courts of law. This statement raised a red flag for me.\nI placed a call to the CCBA and requested my property cards for the last five years. Unlike houses, the property cards of manufactured homes are not posted on the CCBA web site. After receiving the cards, I examined them and the abbreviations RCN, TOTAL DEP %, and RCNLD stood out. When I called the CCBA for an explanation of the abbreviations I received very little assistance. I then e-mailed the CCBA and received a prompt reply with the explanation of the abbreviations. RCN is Replacement Cost New; RCNLD is Replacement Cost New Less Depreciation. This is where I disagree with the CCBA.\nI was being taxed on a fictitious home. I have a real world 14-year-old home and coupled with fact that the RCN along with the total depreciation percent changed every year, I filed an appeal with the Chatham County Board of Equalization (BOE).\nMy appeal was based on the following 3 points:.\n1. The CCBA was taxing me on a fictional home. I have a used 2001 home, I am not replacing it and the CCBA is not using market value.\n2. The RCN and Total Depreciation percentage values are changed every year. The Total Depreciation is changed with the RCN. When you examine the property cards it appears the depreciation is changed to achieve what Fair Market Value you wish to achieve.\n3. In the market place the value of manufactured homes depreciates until they bottom out in value, an exception is when they are attached to property and has been homestead exempted. The State of Georgia treats a non-homestead exempt home similar to an automobile. All homes receive a title from The Georgia DMV. The non-homestead exempt home’s taxes are paid at county’s Tag Office and receive a decal to post in a conspicuous place on the home. This is similar to the automobile decal that we place on our car tags. This is why the NADA (National Automotive Dealers Association) is more applicable for value. The NADA puts a market value based on age and condition, not on replacement cost; this method is similar to a motor vehicle. I obtain a NADA valuation to be presented at the BOE hearing.\nOn Aug. 5 this year, I had my hearing at the BOE. After presenting my case and rebuttal from the CCBA, the BOE reduced my Fair Market Value of $53,700 to $27,000. In the hearing the BOE told the CCBA they needed to examine how manufactured homes were valued and one member said he had a problem with the Total Depreciation Values. While sitting in the waiting room before the hearing, a lady there for her appeal, told me her taxes keep going up. She said she lived in a mobile home park, her husband was disabled and they lived on a fixed income. Even though the taxes are due by May, she pays a portion each month because she can’t afford a lump sum. She said that paying each month prevents them from being evicted from their home. To show the BOE that her home was not worth the CCBA value, the woman had some pictures to show as evidence. I wished her luck, but informed her that she may be paying taxes on a fictitious home. I showed her my research and she was not aware of the practice of replacement cost. This is the purpose of my letter, to inform fellow manufactured home owners to examine their property cards. Since the cards are not posted on the CCBA web site you will have to request them. You may be paying taxes on a fictitious home.\nTo my fellow taxpayers I say this; we have to pay our fair share of taxes in order to have a functional society. While we have an obligation to pay taxes, we also have the obligation of keeping our ever expanding government in check. The same entity that collects taxes maintains its revenue by new sources of taxes (as I alluded to in Kelo versus New London), higher millage rates or artificially increasing property values. While I’m sure the CCBA has good hard working people, I believe there is a subtle political pressure to keep property values as high as possible. Marshall and Swift is a legal way to create value and we have the right to appeal. In the system of checks and balances I did my homework and the BOE checked the Chatham County Board of Assessors, but we the people are the ultimate check on our voracious government. I will repeat what I told the Board of Equalization, “One of the issues in the Revolutionary War was taxation without representation. We now have taxation through imagination.”\nDaniel M.
