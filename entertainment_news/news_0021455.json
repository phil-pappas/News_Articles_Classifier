But for those who aren't die-hard tweeters, the social network and its reverse timeline of micro-messages can be daunting. Enter a new major feature of Twitter: Twitter Moments. Moments uses human curators to highlight the hottest stuff on the network and delivers it in a neat package.\nThat said, Moments has its limits. Yes, it is way easier to flip through a handful of tweets and videos to get into a story than it is to sift through what Twitter serves up in the raw. But it can still be tedious to flip through a Moment -- more editing may be required. Still, if you've been too scared of Twitter until now, this could be an easy on-ramp for you. Just tap the lightning bolt section of the normal Twitter app. Free, for iOS and Android users.\nPhotoshop Mix We're living in a retouched world, and it just got a little easier to bring your own snaps up to par. Adobe's Photoshop has long been the photo alteration tool of choice -- but at quite a cost. It didn't seem worth buying Photoshop just to make a goofy picture of your cat on top of the Eiffel Tower.\nBut with Photoshop Mix, you can use its most common editing tools on your smartphone free. Mix comes with more than just the basics of cropping, instant color correction and filters. It lets you create layered images, blend photos together, crop and remix to your heart's content.\nMost people aren't going to be able to make masterpieces on their phones with Mix. But if you want to retouch some snaps -- you can pull pictures from your camera or a number of cloud services -- it's hard to argue with the simplicity and versatility of this app. Users will need to sign up for an Adobe account.\nFree, for iOS and Android devices.\n Business Technology Internet Washington Post", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-24T15:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:03:36.665+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
