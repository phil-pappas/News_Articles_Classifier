The incident occurred days after the 50-year-old Knight was wounded in a nightclub shooting. \nThe Death Row Records co-founder is also charged in a separate murder case. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Williams has also pleaded not guilty.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T10:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:20:34.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
