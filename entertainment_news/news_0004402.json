Nkurunziza's ruling party cited a constitutional court ruling saying the president could run again.\nThe 15-member commission for dialogue, known by the French acronym CNDI, was sworn in at a ceremony in Burundi's second city, Gitega, but it will be based in the capital Bujumbura.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:23:47.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
