Sartaj also requested the government to stop politicians from visiting their house, as the family did not want any photo-ops. Sartaj urged that his family was already under extreme trauma, and the visits by politicians and the political fights are not making matters any easier. Sartaj works as a technician for the Air Force in Chennai and has been watching over his comatose brother, who is in the ICU and is struggling to stay alive.

A horde of TV news media reporters and journalists followed Sharma to the house of the victim on the outskirts of the capital city of Delhi. Sharma had on Thursday sparked an outrage, after he had called the killing ‘an accident’ and urged people not to give it a political tinge. Sharma had also said that the killing was not organised. Head of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, Asaduddin Owaisi, also met the victim’s family on Friday and attacked Prime minister Narendra Modi for remaining silent on the issue. He took a jibe on the PM, saying that if he could tweet his condolences about Bollywood singer Asha Bhosle’s son’s demise, he should’ve at least expressed some mourning about Akhlaq even if it was on Twitter. ”Is our democracy going to become a banana republic? Can they kill a person? Then why is there law or court or police?” Owaisi had questioned. Mohammad was killed after a Hindu mob lynched him, for eating beef. The mob was instigated by the announcement made by a local temple priest, about Akhlaq consuming beef. \n 22 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T13:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:34:31.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
