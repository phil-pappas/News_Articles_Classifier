It’s hard to find that sweet spot. Our five-year plan was distribution, but we’re almost two years in now and we’re sprinting toward it.” Lock 32 will take that next step in November. Helped by contract brewing partner CB's, who will brew and package the beer in Honeoye Falls, Dunlavey and Lock 32 will self-distribute four beers to each of the stores. They will be available in six packs of 12-ounce bottles. Lock 32 will package and sell its Flower City India Pale Ale, Lock-Ness Scotch Ale, Five 80 Five Irish Style Stout, and Mule Fuel Double IPA.\nCurrently, its beer is only available on premise or in a 32-ounce grumbler at the Pittsford Wegmans. There are plans to release more seasonals in six packs and they hope to be available in bars and restaurants by January.\nThis is the label for Lock 32's Flower City IPA. (Photo: Provided photo)\nThe decision to self-distribute, a model used by a draft-only brewery like Canandaigua's Naked Dove, allows Lock 32 to remain more flexible and maintain greater control over the beer and brand, Dunlavey said.\n\"We’re doing it all ourselves,\" Dunlavey said. \"We’re self-distributing. It’s so important to be there, so important to make those connections and to be able to tell your story to customers. I left my job to do this full time, but I believe in it. I sacrificed to do it, but I believe so much in the product and I am passionate about it. I want to be the person to tell that story.\"\nThis is the label for Lock 32's Lock-Ness Scotch Ale. (Photo: Provided photo)\nBecause of space constraints, Lock 32 is not able to brew and then serve out of its Schoen Place location. They do have a 1-barrel system that includes a 3-barrel fermenter and a 3-barrel Brite tank (both of which are not currently hooked up). But that hasn't stopped them from hiring a full-time brewer. They hired Phill MacArthur earlier this month as their full-time brew master. He's responsible for recipe development and has already seen two of his creations scaled up to the bigger system at CB's.\nThis is the label for Lock 32's Five 80 Five Irish Style Stout. (Photo: Provided photo)\nLock 32's branding is super impressive. And that's not by accident, according to Dunlavey. He said, \"We spend a lot of time (on branding and names). We want it to resonate locally. We want it to have a story. Every bottle should have a story. When we drink, that’s what we love. It’s kind of like listening to music. You want it to mean something. And part of that story is where the name comes from, where the beer comes from. It’s a whole experience.\"\nThe names and labels will certainly jump out to consumers. They are super modern, but also slightly retro with a uniform polka dot pattern in the background. The colors are also very vibrant. Dunlavey said they have used the same graphic designer since they opened, a gentleman who is a Rochester native but is now based in The Netherlands.\nThe expanded production comes at an opportune time for Lock 32. CB's has long been the home of Three Heads Brewing. But since Three Heads is currently constructing its own nearly 20,000-square foot brewery in the Neighborhood of the Arts (slated to be complete early next year), that has created an opening for Lock 32.\n\"The business model allows us some flexibility,\" Dunlavey said. \"It’s a dynamic solution for us. We can scale up at the drop of a hat. CB’s has been able to do that. The timing couldn’t be any more perfect as we start doubling and tripling our batches.\"\nThis is the label for Lock 32's Mule Fuel Double IPA. (Photo: Provided photo)\nDuring my recent visit to Lock 32, I was able to sample all eight beers on draft. That's a huge step up from when they opened with just three beers on tap. I got to try each of the four beers that was going to be bottled. I was really surprised with the vibrancy of the Mule Fuel DIPA. It was super bright and juicy (owing quite a bit to the use of Falconer's Flight, a proprietary blend of six Pacific Northwest hops). It really reminded me of another CB's DIPA, OT20, which is the beer they make for the Old Toad (and still the beer that I believe is the best in CB's contract portfolio. And this isn't counting what Three Heads currently makes, because they will soon be their own entity.)\nI also really enjoyed Four Knots, one of MacArthur's first two beers. It's a sessionable American Pale Ale that features nothing but juicy, cirtrusy Citra hops. The beer's bouquet was super fragrant and inviting. (And it would probably make a great air freshener.) It was surprisingly full-bodied and wasn't hindered by a watery finish that plagues many beers in that category. If you were to call this a session IPA, I certainly wouldn't argue.\nI was really intrigued by the barrel-aged version of Lock 32's Five 80 Five. As a dry Irish stout, you often don't get beers that vary much from the category guidelines. But they allowed this one to fully ferment and then it was allowed to mature in a rye whiskey barrel from Finger Lakes Distilling. I really liked to see the barrel complexity that it added to a smaller beer like that. It added some great notes of vanilla and oak that really rounded out the flavor.\nWCLEVELAND@Gannett.com", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/24/Rochester/Rochester/635812958157145354-585-label.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/df798910ca7d8b57fc782dc353a10d452521878d/c=32-0-1951-1084&r=x329&c=580x326/local/-/media/2015/10/24/Rochester/Rochester/635812958157145354-585-label.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6e5ad56be295f6c878e47293bbf485477d4b0609/c=34-0-1946-1080&r=x329&c=580x326/local/-/media/2015/10/24/Rochester/Rochester/635812954137467587-lockness-label.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7eb41189396df8f859824ba2c71f3cd850ca94e3/c=30-0-1949-1084&r=x329&c=580x326/local/-/media/2015/10/24/Rochester/Rochester/635812953566191925-flowercity-label.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/24/Rochester/Rochester/635812954137467587-lockness-label.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/24/Rochester/Rochester/635812959044791044-mulefuel-label.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/23de2af81083ae3743d5d709aba0f2ebfe19b678/c=31-0-1950-1084&r=x329&c=580x326/local/-/media/2015/10/24/Rochester/Rochester/635812959044791044-mulefuel-label.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/24/Rochester/Rochester/635812953566191925-flowercity-label.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-25T01:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:06:43.441+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
