The alternative is horrifying - because the alternative is 'the strongest survive'.\"That means the one who sells his news best survives, which means we're gonna have Fox News all over the world. I mean, the stupidification of America... they have one hour every evening where you can see BBC news on PBS, and that is the window of air when I'm in America.\"Now of course you can get a lot of information on the net, but that was the only time I could watch television and know I would get news, and not entertainment.\" \n© Getty Images / Carl Court Skarsgård insisted that public broadcasting in the United Kingdom is \"something worth fighting for\" and that it would be \"dangerous\" not to support it.\"If a country wants to be democratic, you have to have an educated electorate, and they have to be knowledgeable, and the only way to guarantee that is to have public television and public radio.\" Mark Gatiss wants the BBC to \"grow a pair of bollocks\" and fight back The Swedish actor was also not shy about expressing his views towards the current British government. \"I think the way you vote [in the United Kingdom] is despicable,\" he said.\"We've had eight years now with a friend of David Cameron in Sweden - [Fredrik Reinfeldt, Prime Minister of Sweden from 2006 to 2014] - and it has segregated the country badly.\" Stellan Skarsgård stars in BBC One's River , beginning tonight (October 13) at 9pm.
