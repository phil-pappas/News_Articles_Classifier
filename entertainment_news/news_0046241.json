How do I embrace this new chapter in my life? How do I really walk the walk? What does it mean to be confident? It means letting go, being authentic, saying, 'I don't give a f**k and this is who I am. I want to show the side of me that's real, that's liberated, that's free.' \n\"(I said), 'What if we do a photo shoot where it's totally raw? Super-sexy, but no make-up, no fancy lighting, no retouching and no clothing. Let's do it here, let's do it now.\" Copyright WENN.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T18:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:46:32.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
