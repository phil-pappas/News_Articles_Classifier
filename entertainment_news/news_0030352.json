They may even end up running away with the film from their more senior co-stars.\nAmid all this brouhaha over today’s hottest emerging love teams, the tandem between Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla has been conveniently dislocated, if not left out in the cold.\nKathNiel is the only established love team missing in MMFF 2015. The pair should work harder to claim their title as the No. 1 tandem in the scene today. Ratings-wise, their “Pangako Sa ’Yo” is facing stiff competition from JaDine’s “On The Wings Of Love.”\n• • •\nNORA IN “LITTLE MOMMY ”: Nora Aunor is set to start filming anytime soon her first teleserye under GMA Network, “Little Mommy.” Earlier, the superstar guested in a few episodes of another GMA production, “Pari ’Koy.”\nWhile the title “Little Mommy” can mislead viewers into thinking Nora is the character referred to in the heading, such is not the case. Program manager Hazel Abonita explains Kris Bernal plays the intellectually challenged “Little Mommy” in the title role. Nora is cast as her grandmother, a swinging former band rocker.\n“It’s a light, comedic role,” says Nora.\nIt is also something the public may want to see Nora in following a standard fare of heavy dramatic roles. I was telling Nora that perhaps she should pick a romantic comedy for her new film to serve as a break from all those moments of sadness in her film and TV projects.\nShe said she’s really on the lookout for one such role and project, preferably for film. The last time Nora did a comedy-drama was in Elwood Perez’s “Ang Totoong Buhay Ni Pacita M.” She was also most effective as a comic in “Lollipops And Roses” and “Burong Talangka,” also by Perez.\n• • •\nPASSION FOR ARTISTRY : On playing a supporting role, Nora has no qualms whatsoever. She believes it is her duty as a senior actor to help younger actors. She speaks of her passion for the film and TV industries as having been worth it after all these years.\n“When you love your work with passion, it will honor you back,” she says. Nora’s harvest of awards and recognition from local and international bodies will be enriched furthermore by her winning the 2015 GUSI Peace Prize, where she joins an international roster of laureates in various disciplines. She is the only Filipino in the lineup of 19 awardees made up of former presidents, doctors, physicists. Awarding ceremony will be on Nov. 25 at the PICC.\nAbonita clears Nora’s role is not any less important than those of her co-actors, including that of Eddie Garcia’s.\nNora is also set to start a new film, “Tuos,” to be shot entirely in Iloilo and where she plays an Ilonga native. She has been researching, studying the native tongue.\nShe shrieks, “Imagine mo, Bicolana ako, tapos ngayon Ilongga na ako!”", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:01:50.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
