Photo: Simon Schluter \nMusic has always  been an integral part of Suzannah Espie's life. Growing up in Fremantle, her dad worked in music management and she fell asleep most nights to the sound of her mum playing the piano. \nShe's been writing songs and singing in bands since her teens, and mesmerising audiences since moving to Melbourne at the age of 18. Five albums with the sweet harmonies of alt-country outfit GIT, which formed in 1997, and subsequent solo albums have garnered her praise as one of the matriarchs of Australian songwriting.\nBut for the past few years, critical acclaim has taken a back seat to Espie's private pain. A casual listen to her new album reveals her trademark angelic voice is as sweet as in her previous work – all honey-smooth vocals backed by a soulful country lilt. But a closer audit of Espie's lyrics reveals something more.\nMother's Not Feeling Herself Today is a \"themed\" work, a soul-baring musical expression of the singer's conflicting feelings about motherhood. Many a musician has proclaimed their album \"cathartic\" but Espie is adamant writing this album was \"necessary\".\nAdvertisement \"I don't know if I set out to do this, but ultimately, it's been my way of 'coming clean', you know? There are lots of people in my life who had no idea what I was feeling until they heard these songs,\" Espie says of her fourth solo album. \"I guess that's ... the songwriter in me. I just suddenly wanted to do it.\"\nAfter the birth of her second child four years ago, Espie had kept her feelings of post-natal \"guilt, failure and fear\" to herself, fearing judgment, even from friends and family. While every day was a fight with her \"darkest thoughts\", and the feeling that people saw her as a failure as a mother, Espie was never diagnosed with post-natal depression. \"I didn't put up my hand and say, 'I'm not doing that well.\"'\nShe was getting out of bed every day and \"functioning; more than functioning\", but two years ago realised she needed to talk to someone.\n\"That's when I started writing about it – which is sort of arse-about,\" she says. \"I suddenly thought to myself, 'I need to think about things and do things differently' ... which kind of amazes me because hereI am with this album, I've written about it.\"\nMother's Not Feeling Herself Today is the follow-up to 2012's well-received  Sea of Lights. She had her son John in 2006 and as she says in the new album's liner notes, she was determined to \"do it all\". \"Before this I was playing gigs and living a life with my musician husband that in many ways I barely remember. I was determined ... to keep making music, travel the world, be a fun, fair, nurturing mother to my happy, well-adjusted children, being glamorous all the while. This was not to be.\" \nIt wasn't until after the birth of daughter Isla four years ago that she really felt a fracture. Stumbling across writer and artist Rachel Powers' book Motherhood and Creativity: The Divided Heart, which features interviews with Australian performers and artists about the challenges of combining motherhood with creative work, was a revelation. '\n'It was the first time I'd heard people talking about all this stuff that I had lived and it was incrediblycomforting.\" \nEspie felt \"compelled\" to write. And the album's song titles are telling: The Day I Lost You, The Next Room and the first single, I'm Sorry, inspired by a speech she read by author Clare Wright. The song features a chorus of 13 of Espie's songwriting friends, among them Kylie Auldist, Lucie Thorne, Kerri Simpson, Rachel Tidd and Liz Stringer. \n\"Clare talked about driving home from the doctor when it all became clear to her and she was sitting in the car chanting 'I'm sorry, I've failed' ... that was the crux of that song – and the sentiment in the album,\" says Espie, pausing. \"Bit grim, isn't it?\"\nIt's country music, though, isn't it? People don't expect it to be happy.  \"That's right!\" she says, laughing.  Espie's been performing songs from the album for only a couple of months but is already taken aback by feedback from fans and peers.  \"People come up to me after [shows] and just open the floodgates!\"  \nMother's Not Feeling Herself Today is out now. Suzannah Espie plays on November 12 at the DJango Bar, Marrickville; $22.70.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:04:30.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
