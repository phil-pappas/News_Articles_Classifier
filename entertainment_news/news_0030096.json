This year, GfK forecasts that figure will rise again to more than 14 million soundbars.\nSoundbars with external subwoofers are particularly hot items, according to the company, and Bluetooth connectivity is the key factor in purchasing decisions as consumers increasingly opt for the simplicity of playing music from smartphones and tablets.\nFor consumers, the good news with all of these trends is that creating a home-theatre or listening to high quality music throughout your home doesn’t need to cost a small fortune.\nHere are five tips for creating a home theatre on a budget.\n1. Cheaper big-screen TVs: Televisions are not just getting more advanced, they’re becoming cheaper by thousands of dollars. While the first OLED (organic light-emitting diode) televisions cost $10,000 when they launched in Australia in 2013, but this year LG launched an ultra high-definition 55-inch OLED TV with four times the pixels for $4000 less. Similarly, Samsung has dropped the price of its 78-inch Series 9 SUHD television by $3000 since its launch earlier this year, now selling it for $9000, while a more modestly sized 48-inch SUHD TV costs $3300 -- $1700 less.\nImpressive way to watch TV ... the LG 4K OLED TV.

Google’s Chromecast device, priced at $49, can stream games, apps, movies and photos to most televisions. The stick-shaped device simply plugs into a TV’s HDMI port and connects to a phone or tablet wirelessly. Alternatively, Apple will soon release an update to its TV box that will deliver more apps including games, new software, and add Siri to the remote control to search for content. The new Apple TV is expected to launch this month. The current model costs $109.\n3. Look for versatility: Soundbars are long, single speakers that replace multi-speaker setups in lounge rooms. There are many available to boost TV audio, but increasingly companies are coming up with ways to add extras to their form. The Philips Fidelio B5 Soundbar ($1100), for example, has two removable speakers at each end that can be placed behind your couch for surround-sound movie watching. LG’s budget model LAS35OB ($249) links wirelessly to a subwoofer.\nLook for good sound ... the Philips Fidelio Soundbar HTL9100. Source: Supplied\n4. Start small and build: Sonos created wireless music system nearly 15 years ago and big names in home-entertainment have followed its lead. These speakers wirelessly connect to one another and your smartphone or tablet computer to play music. They can be used to play the same music throughout your home, or different music in each room, receiving instructions from a connected device. One reason they gained popularity is users can start small, with just one speaker, and build on their system later. A Sonos Play: 1 speaker costs $299 and is a good starting point. Later, if you purchase two, you can set them as a stereo pair. Add a Playbar ($999) and you’ve got a 5.1-channel home-theatre setup more versatile than something just used for watching movies.\nWork your way up .. the Sonos Play: 5 is the flagship speaker in the Sonos family that can be finetuned with speaker-running software called Trueplay.

The WeMo Insight Switch by Belkin ($100) lets you set up a schedule when your devices can be used and helps you monitor their power usage costs.\nStart collecting your Ultimate Family Movie Collection next weekend.
