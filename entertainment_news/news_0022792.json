This time, she said, affording diapers is a constant struggle.\n“It’s like being on a different planet, being on this side of the fence,” she said. “I get $420 a month and diapers cost $100. It’s impossible.”\nMackowski is among tens of thousands of low-income local parents coping with diaper need, an under-recognized consequence of poverty experts say can result in unhealthy babies, family stress and maternal depression.\n“It’s a national problem. Everyone believes someone else is helping,” said Nancy Woodland, executive director of WestSide Baby, a Seattle diaper bank that provides more than 1 million diapers a year to agencies that help parents like Mackowski make ends meet.\nDiapers are a staple: Babies need seven to 12 changes a day, at a cost of about $900 to $1,200 a year. But government-assistance programs — including Supplemental Nutrition Insurance Program and Women, Infants and Children — won’t pay for them.\nWithout a prepurchased supply of diapers, parents can’t enroll children in day care — which often means they can’t work, added Renee Zimmerman, executive director of Eastside Baby Corner, another local bank based in Issaquah, Wash.\n“Diapers become a huge barrier,” she said.\nTo avert the need, the two agencies expect to provide about 2 million diapers to area families this year, funneling stacks of Huggies and other brands through food banks and social-service agencies.\nThey get diapers as part of the National Diaper Bank Network, which includes about 300 banks nationwide. And they rely hugely on local donations.\nThe diapers are mostly disposables. Cloth diapers are available, but low-income families may find they’re not a realistic option. Laundromats and some apartment buildings ban diapers and other items soiled with human waste, said Joanne Goldblum, executive director of the Connecticut-based NDBN. And even if diapers are allowed, the cost of using them is high.\nDiaper need is predictably linked to poverty, experts said.\n“It’s sort of a silly thing to talk about. It evokes jokes immediately,” Woodland said. “But it requires a serious conversation about human waste.”\nResearch shows a shortage of diapers is anything but silly. About 30 percent of women in a 2013 study by Yale University researchers reported the problem, and about 8 percent of them reported “stretching” diapers, said Megan Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry and child study at the Yale School of Medicine.\nThat means the women routinely kept diapers on babies longer than recommended, or emptied solids from soiled diapers and used them again. Woodland said she’s seen families resort to wrapping their babies in newspaper secured with rubber bands or fashioning diapers out of plastic bags and paper towels.\nBut stretching diapers can cause health problems, including urinary-tract infections and diaper dermatitis — severe diaper rash — in babies. And it also can make them miserable.\n“Crying and screaming babies offer a level of stress that is difficult for families that are not struggling,” Woodland noted.\nAlong with stress can come depression, according to the Yale study, published in the journal Pediatrics. Moms facing diaper need are more likely to suffer mental-health and behavioral problems, which can affect how they treat their babies.\n“When you think of a mother­ not being able to soothe a crying child, it interferes with that attachment that the mother and child are forming,” Smith said. “It does not allow a mother to feel confident in her parenting abilities and really just increases that stress if a mother cannot soothe by providing a fresh diaper.”\nMackowski said her own experience proves that’s true. She’d been a stay-at-home mom during a 10-year-marriage, with no higher education and no recent work experience.\nHer divorce was un­expected and contentious, she said. Mackowski found herself with no job, no money and no home. She said that because she couldn’t provide a stable environment, her ex-husband was granted primary custody of their daughter.\nMackowski said she sought help from shelters and churches,­ and during a troubled time became pregnant. There was no question about keeping the baby, she said, although the future was frightening.\n“Not being able to provide the basic necessities for my daughter made me question if I was even suitable to raise her, and if it was even fair to knowingly raise her in poverty as a single parent,” Mackowski said. “You have no idea what it truly feels like until you are a parent that cannot provide diapers for your very own baby.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:38:35.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
