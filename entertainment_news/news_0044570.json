COURTESY OF CITY OF NORCO Related article » Three of the five Norco City Council seats are up for grabs next month, and all seven Norco City Council candidates say increasing revenue for long-term city projects is a top priority.\nNorco has struggled to gather money for capital improvements over the past several years, due at least in part to the recession and the end of redevelopment in 2011, said City Councilman Kevin Bash, who is not up for re-election until 2017.\nThe recent soft opening of Silverlakes Equestrian and Sports Park on Hamner Avenue has piqued the interest of developers, and the success of businesses moving into Norco will affect the city’s ability to complete long overdue projects such as replacing sewer lines and repairing horse trail fencing.\nIncumbents Herb Higgins and Berwin Hanna are seeking new terms on Nov. 3. They’re joined by five other hopefuls: Jason Bemowski, Lisa Campbell, Ted Hoffman, Lance Gregory and Robin Grundmeyer. Each highlight their plans to meet the city’s infrastructure needs.\n�\nNORCO CITY COUNCIL: CANDIDATE BIOS\nSeven candidates are running in the Nov. 3 election for the Norco City Council.

A recreational runner, Grundmeyer said more events such as 5K runs would draw people into town and may keep them there overnight, raking in more tax revenue.\n“We need to think outside the box about the types of events that can be hosted at our facilities,” Grundmeyer said. “The Brew N Cue Festival (a barbecue at Norco’s George Ingalls Equestrian Center) is a perfect example of how the right events can draw large groups of folks to our town.”\nMany candidates said it’s important to strike while the iron is hot with respect to Silverlakes.\nThe city should capitalize by seeking businesses, restaurants and hotels, Campbell said.\n“This means developing multiple vacant parcels within the city with point-of-sale businesses that will benefit the city via our portion of the sales tax revenue,” Campbell said.\nCampbell, Gregory and Bemowski said one way to entice businesses is to make the city’s code enforcement department more efficient. Both recommend streamlining the permit process to reduce delays on new projects. Gregory said the city should hire another code enforcement officer to ensure the town doesn’t fall into disrepair.\n“When there is a lack of enforcement this creates a ripple effect and can hurt home values and have a negative impact on the desire to be a destination spot,” Gregory said.\nBemowski also criticized the permitting process, saying the cumbersome format has stifled growth.\n1 2 3 Next Page", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/reelectberwin", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvm7q4-b88525681z.120151002155401000gomcc30i.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "https://www.facebook.com/Higgins-for-Norco-Council-2015-1024445420933796/timeline/", "https://www.facebook.com/LisaCampbellforCouncil", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvm7q3-b88525681z.120151002155401000guhccael.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvm7q4-b88525681z.120151002155401000gomcc30i.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvm7q4-b88525681z.120151002155401000gdrcbkcf.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvm7q5-b88525681z.120151002155401000grrcba30.10.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/Committee-to-Elect-Ted-Hoffman-to-the-Norco-City-Council-2015-1588797388045039/timeline/", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvm7q5-b88525681z.120151002155401000grrcba1e.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvm7q5-b88525681z.120151002155401000gdrcbp8j.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvm7q4-b88525681z.120151002155401000grrcba9m.10.jpg", "http://electlancegregory.webs.com/", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvm7q4-b88525681z.120151002155401000grrcba9m.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvm7q5-b88525681z.120151002155401000gc5cb2sb.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/mycapture/nvm7q4-b88525681z.120151002155401000gomcc30i.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/mycapture/nvm7q4-b88525681z.120151002155401000gdrcbkcf.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvm7q4-b88525681z.120151002155401000gdrcbkcf.10.jpg", "http://riv.merlinone.net/THUMBS2013/TDIR29289/AX054_2017_9.JPG", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/JasonBemowskiNorcoCityCouncil", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/mycapture/nvm7q5-b88525681z.120151002155401000gdrcbp8j.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/mycapture/nvm7q5-b88525681z.120151002155401000grrcba30.10.jpg", "http://robingrundmeyerforcouncil.weebly.com/", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/nvm7q5-b88525681z.120151002155401000grrcba1e.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvm7q5-b88525681z.120151002155401000gdrcbp8j.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/mycapture/nvm7q4-b88525681z.120151002155401000grrcba9m.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/mycapture/nvm7q5-b88525681z.120151002155401000gc5cb2sb.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvm7q5-b88525681z.120151002155401000grrcba30.10.jpg", "http://files.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/multiplier/Decision_2015.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/nvm7q5-b88525681z.120151002155401000gc5cb2sb.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvm7q3-b88525681z.120151002155401000guhccael.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:27:27.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
