Belen\nOctober 1, 2015 Elwood Perez, Ronnie Liang, producer Rex A. Tiri of ‘Esoterika: Maynila\nThose who missed the screening of “Esoterika: Maynila” at the Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival last August and at the Shangrila Cineplex last week can still watch it at the Quezon City International Pink Festival until Oct. 11 at the Gateway Cinema 1, Araneta Center, Cubao, Quezon City.\nThe film, megged by 70-year old filmmaker Elwood Perez, will join prizewinning movies from the Berlin Film Festival.\nMaking this possible is QCIPFF Director Nick Deocampo who was part of the jury at the 2015 Teddy Awards.\n“Dressed as a Girl (UK)” will kick-off the QCIPFF on Oct. 6.\n“Nasty Baby (USA),” on the other hand, will close the festival on Oct. 11.\nOther foreign films to be screened at the QCIPFF are “El Hombre Nuevo/The New Man” (Uruguay/Chile/Nicaragua), which won Best Documentary in this year’s Teddy, “Kumu Hina” (USA) Teddy Jury Prize winner, and “Stories of Our Lives” (Kenya/South Africa).\nAside from “Esoterika Maynila,” local films include “Esprit de Corps,” “I Love You, Thank You,”“Pinoy Transking,” and selected short films like “Julie” from Cebu, and the Fil-Am film, “Shunned.”\n“Esoterika Maynila” is a statement film for Elwood. “I want to stay away from complacency,” he said.\nNote that prior, Elwood is mostly known for his populist films. He doesn’t want to do that anymore.\n“Ganun ako ngayon, mapagtanong. I get anybody’s opinion like papaano ko ba ma-cresendo pa ito? Sabi nila i-blood transfusion natin ulit.\nBarilin natin ulit. Sabi ko I did that twice already in two different films. Sabi ko siguro kailangan na akong mag-retire. Pare-pareho na lang,” he reflected.\nHe is grateful that he was entrusted with “Esoterika Maynila.” “Without it, give up na sana ako,” he said.\nAs for his film, he described it as a “roller coaster ride.” He said that he’ll simply hold his viewers’ hands and bring them to where “Esoterika Maynila” should bring them.\n“Esoterika Maynila” stars Ronnie Liang and Vince Tañada.\nThe Quezon City International Pink Film Festival (QCIPFF) will close Quezon City’ Diamond Jubilee Year Celebration with a landmark event that will provide greater recognition for the country’s lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) community.\nWhat will make the QCIPFF more meaningful is the passage of the historic “Gender Fair Ordinance.” The first in Asia, it signifies Quezon City’s progressive outlook towards the future under the administration of Mayor Herbert Bautista.\nThe pioneering law makes Quezon City the first government agency in the Asian region to create a government-supported LGBT Council. With such a progressive agenda to promote, the festival serves as a fitting platform that will seek to galvanize Quezon City’s stature not only in the Philippines but in Asia as the leading model city for gender emancipation.\nThe QCIPFF is organized by the Quezon City Pride Council for the Quezon City Government and the Diamond Jubilee Committee.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:45:37.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
