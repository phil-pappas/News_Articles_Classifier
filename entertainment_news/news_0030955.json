The Mumbai-based actress will be shuttling between Bengaluru and Kerala to promote her Kannada movie Ring Road and Malayalam film with Mohanlal. As Ring Road gears up for release this week, Nikita tells us why she is excited about featuring in the movie. Excerpts...\nWhat drew you to Ring Road? When Priya Belliappa (director) called me, I was excited to be a part of the movie after I learnt that it is being made by a team of women. I liked the script and my character as well; it is something that I have not played before. That was a big draw for me.\nWhat is your character like? I play Vijay's wife in the movie. Vijay is a police officer, investigating a particular case, while my character is his rather possessive homemaker wife. She doesn't like the fact that her husband doesn't have enough time to spend with her and is suspicious of him. I have never played such an eccentric character before.\nAre you possessive in real life as well? Not at all. When we were shooting, I used to ask Priya if she really wanted me to act like that, as I was not sure if there are girls who behave like that. But she kept reminding me that it is just the character. I was a little worried about essaying such a role, as so far, I have mostly been seen as this lovely, perfect girl onscreen.\nWhat do you like doing when you're not working? I'm getting my house renovated, so I'm currently busy with that. I am also toning up for my Hindi release. I do hot boot camp, play tennis and do yoga three times a week. The hot boot camp is a high intensity workout that involves 200 skipping rope jumps, 200 squats, 100 hurdles and so forth. I am basically doing this as I also want to participate in the Mumbai marathon next year.\nHave you always been this active? I have always been into sports, right from school. I play tennis and squash, apart from my regular workouts. With all the extra exercise, I just want to go home and sleep at the end of the day. I go to bed by 11 pm now, since I am so drained out. My friends ask me why I don't chill out and take things easy. I tell them that when I used to work 326 days a year, I never had time to do anything. I have free time now, so I want to do all the things that I've always wanted to.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:12:05.559+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
