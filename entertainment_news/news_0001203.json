But this delicate balance was ripped apart when the alien apocalypse arrived in Dillford and put an end to all the harmony. Now it's humans vs. vampires vs. zombies in all-out, blood-sucking, brain-eating, vamp-staking mortal combat – and all of them are on the run from the aliens. It is up to three teenagers – one human, one vampire, and one zombie – to team up, figure out how to get rid of the interplanetary visitors, and try to restore order to this \"normal\" little town.\nCommenting on the announcement, Matt Tolmach , the film's producer, said, \"I'm so excited for audiences to experience Freaks of Nature . We're so proud of this amazing cast -- Nic, Mackenzie, and Josh, along with Denis Leary , Bob Odenkirk , Keegan-Michael Key , Ed Westwick , Vanessa Hudgens , Patton Oswalt , and Ian Roberts . It's hilarious and terrifying -- a perfect Halloween movie.\"\nFreaks of Nature is directed by Robbie Pickering , written by Oren Uziel , and produced by Matt Tolmach , and stars Nicholas Braun , Mackenzie Davis (who can be seen on screen in the hit film The Martian ), and Josh Fadem .\nFor more information, visit Facebook.com/FreaksOfNatureMovie .\nAbout Sony Pictures Entertainment\nSony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) is a subsidiary of Sony Entertainment Inc., a subsidiary of Tokyo -based Sony Corporation.
