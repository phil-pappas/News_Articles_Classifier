So the band returned to the studio to finish the now-full-length, fan-mandated album The Secret Service, out last week. \nThe multi-platinum success of their 2007 debut album, The Trick to Life, and singles such as Worried About Ray and Goodbye Mr. A, raised huge expectations for its follow-up, not least at The Hoosiers’ record label. \nThe prophetically titled The Illusion of Safety was, all the band agree, a troubled project from the start. \nThe self-released News From Nowhere, released in 2014, was an astonishing return to form. \nShattering their previous run of an album every three to four years, this autumn’s LP release – only a year after their third album – reveals a band hitting their stride through a purple patch, improving as they discover they have more to say than ever. \nEnjoy all the old hits and new material when the band appear at Southampton ’s Engine Rooms on Sunday.
