Now the band refocuses on “The Beginning Stages Of…,” their debut album recorded in two days in 2000. It was a rebellion against guitar rock and a statement of purpose for bandleader Tim DeLaughter, who was grieving a friend and former collaborator. By the time the band toured the album, their stage spectacle had eclipsed the original arrangements. For this show, the band will play the entire album in sequence.
