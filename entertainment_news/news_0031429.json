He's a friend of mine, and he's been pestering me to record a record, so we did it here in Texas and he produced the album.\" \n\"The Loneliest Man I Ever Met\" was released this month. Friedman, who has toured extensively and released a slew of live albums over the past four decades, performs on Wednesday in Stanhope and at the end of the month in Ringwood. \n\"Every time I asked him about recording new music he would grumble, 'Why should I do that?' \" Molnar, a Glen Gardner resident, said in a separate interview. \nMolnar, who plays guitar and provides backup vocals on the album, has worked with Friedman for five years and is opening Wednesday's show along with Joe Cirotti, a Hackettstown resident who also plays guitar on \"Loneliest Man.\" \n\"I finally got to him when I suggested he do something low-pressure,\" Molnar said. \"Where we're not watching the clock in the studio.\" He said, 'That's a great idea.' I was shocked that he was actually going to do it.\" \n\"Loneliest Man\" is a stripped-down affair, with Friedman singing and playing acoustic guitar backed by piano and harmonica. \n\"I think the songs stand out because the arrangements are so sparse,\" said Friedman, 70. \"Brian did a great job producing. You can really hear what the songs are about.\" \nIn addition to Friedman originals \"Lady Yesterday,\" \"Wild Man From Borneo\" and the title track, the album features a duet with Willie Nelson on the latter's \"Bloody Mary Morning,\" Bob Dylan's \"Girl From the North Country\" and songs by Johnny Cash, Tom Waits and Warren Zevon. \n\"They're not cover songs, they're more interpretations,\" Friedman said. \"They're halfway between the original songs and Kinky Friedman.\" He said each song has a personal meaning for him. \" 'Pickin' Time' (Johnny Cash) was my father's favorite,\" Friedman said. \"I had a girl from the north country I let slip through my fingers. Warren Zevon was a friend, and I think we did him proud.\" \nThe songs' bare arrangements lend a wistful feel, especially on \"Lady Yesterday\" and Waylon Jennings' \"Freedom to Stay.\" For the record, the self-deprecating Friedman said he is not the loneliest man he's ever met. \n\"I'm getting a little too happy after being miserable for 68 years,\" he said. \"You've got to be miserable to be an artist. My definition of an artist is someone who's ahead of his time and behind on his rent.\" \nOne thing that Friedman does enjoy is hitting the road. His 30-day tour, which began last week, includes only three days off. \"If you're out there you might as well work,\" he said. \"You start running on pure adrenaline after a while. You put yourself at the Hank Williams level of playing, getting out of Dodge and riding to the next town.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:36:00.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
