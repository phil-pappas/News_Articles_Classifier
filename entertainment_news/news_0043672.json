After making $2.2 million in limited release, Aaron Sorkin's take on the late Apple CEO pulled in just over $7 million in its first weekend in wide release. (Video via Universal Pictures ) \nBut, Steve Jobs only cost $30 million to produce, unlike the biggest flop of the weekend. \nProving once and for all that Vin Diesel should really stick to driving cars, \"The Last Witch Hunter\" cost $90 million to make and brought in less than $11 million in its debut. \nOther notable flops from the weekend include another \"Paranormal Activity\" movie, \"Jem and the Holograms\" and \"Rock the Kasbah.\" All debuted this weekend, all struggled to keep a pulse at the box office. \nFalling to No. 2 this weekend is \"Goosebumps\" , bringing in an estimated $15.5 million . Having brought in $23 million in last week's debut, this weekend's total marks just a 34 percent drop in ticket sales, which is fantastic considering all the other new movies that came out this weekend. \nIn fact, all three movies in the top three this week are showing great staying power at the box office. \nTaking third is Steven Spielberg's \"Bridge of Spies,\" which brought in an estimated $11.3 million in its second week out. That brings its worldwide total to $39 million, meaning the Tom Hanks Cold War drama still hasn't broke even. \nAs for next week, Sandra Bullock brings her iconic charm to the campaign trail .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:25:20.245+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
