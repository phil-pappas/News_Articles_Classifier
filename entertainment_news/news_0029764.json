There are, of course, many good reasons to stay at home on the couch, not least of them the fact that a 30th anniversary box set of all three movies and a ton of bonus features came out Tuesday.\nBut why not share the day or the rest of the week with fellow fans?

It’s here!\nOct. 21, 2015: The date on which Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly and Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown landed after time traveling 30 years into the future in the second installment of the “Back to the Future” film trilogy.\nOr you can look at it as the date from which the filmmakers peered at the end of the ’80s and tried to imagine what the world of today – this very day – would be like.\nHere, let’s check real quick and see how they did.\nTake a moment and look up in the sky. See any flying cars?\nYeah, that didn’t quite pan out.\nNow pick up your phone and talk to a friend on FaceTime or Skype.\nVideo calls! Nailed it!\nAs movie theaters prepare to show all three movies today and as anybody lucky enough to own a DeLorean, the gull-winged car in which Doc built his time machine, gets mobbed everywhere they go, we went in search of the facts, the fictions, the lure and the legend.\nBuckle your seat belts.\nPREDICTING THE FUTURE?\nGreat Scott! It’s here!\nOct. 21, 2015: The date on which Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly and Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown landed after time traveling 30 years into the future in the second installment of the “Back to the Future” film trilogy.\nOr you can look at it as the date from which the filmmakers peered at the end of the ’80s and tried to imagine what the world of today – this very day – would be like.\nHere, let’s check real quick and see how they did.\nTIME MACHINE\nIn the movie: Marty travels to the past and the future in a DeLorean outfitted by his scientist pal Doc with a flux capacitor that can navigate the circuits of time.\nIn reality: Don’t hold your breath. And DeLoreans aren’t even rolling off assembly lines anymore, either.\nExpert says: Time travel is still, as far as anyone today knows, fantasy. “Fundamentally, it’s that no one has any ideas to get around the idea,” said Ward Beyermann, associate professor of physics and astronomy at UC Riverside. “Predicting the future is dangerous. No one knows.”\nPREDICTING THE FUTURE?\nGreat Scott! It’s here!\nOct. 21, 2015: The date on which Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly and Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown landed after time traveling 30 years into the future in the second installment of the “Back to the Future” film trilogy.\nOr you can look at it as the date from which the filmmakers peered at the end of the ’80s and tried to imagine what the world of today – this very day – would be like.\nHere, let’s check real quick and see how they did.\nTRASH FOR FUEL\nIn the movie: The Doc tosses trash into the Mr. Fusion Home Energy Reactor to power the DeLorean time machine.\nIn reality: Matter such as potatoes and frying oils have been turned into biodiesel fuel. As for widespread use, it will likely arrive in the next 10 to 15 years, according to Char Miller, environmental analysis professor at Pomona College in Claremont.\nExpert says: “Even 30 years ago,” Miller said, “the crazy Doc Brown was telling us that everyday objects like banana peels and beer cans can be turned into energy. And it’s taken us that long to realize that landfills are filled with sources of energy.”\nPREDICTING THE FUTURE?\nGreat Scott! It’s here!\nOct. 21, 2015: The date on which Michael J.

Who needs the 91 freeway when you can rise above it all?\nIn reality: While Jetsons-style skycars won’t be an alternative to a jammed freeway anytime soon, a number of companies are working on prototypes.\nExpert says: “It’s difficult to imagine the impact of flying cars,” said UCR’s Beyermann. “You would need a device that can take off, land and fly in this environment. And it has to be quiet and safe. We have enough trouble traveling in two dimensions without throwing in a third.”\nPREDICTING THE FUTURE?\nGreat Scott! It’s here!\nOct. 21, 2015: The date on which Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly and Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown landed after time traveling 30 years into the future in the second installment of the “Back to the Future” film trilogy.\nOr you can look at it as the date from which the filmmakers peered at the end of the ’80s and tried to imagine what the world of today – this very day – would be like.\nHere, let’s check real quick and see how they did.\nSELF-TYING SHOES\nIn the movie: When Marty arrives in Hill Valley on Oct. 21, 2015, his scientist pal Doc Brown hands him a pair of shoes. After pulling them on, they automatically conform to his feet and are “laced up.”\nIn reality: Nike has a patent for self-lacing shoes and auctioned 1,500 pairs for charity in 2011. But, no, they haven’t landed at the mall yet.\nExpert says: The fashion industry is buzzing about the possibility. Nike and Kanye West are already starting to use more futuristic textiles in footwear. “I think the self-lacing shoes is going to be something” real, said Erica Moreno, educational outreach coordinator for Porcelynne’s Fabric Boutique & Design Institute in Redlands.\nPREDICTING THE FUTURE?\nGreat Scott!

Luxury car manufacturer Lexus made a splash earlier this year with a video showing off its hoverboard, which uses magnetic fields and superconductors.\nExpert says: “For the record, Lexus isn’t developing a hoverboard or flying car for consumer use but there are agencies that are exploring this for a sellable consumer item,” Lexus spokesman Maurice Durand wrote in an email.\nPREDICTING THE FUTURE?\nGreat Scott!

A lifelike hologram of the late Tupac Shakur joined Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre onstage at the 2012 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. A year later, Rock the Bells in San Bernardino brought both Eazy-E and ODB to the stage in hologram form.\nExpert says: The 3D billboards have made the rounds at trade shows, but the technology hasn’t reached large outdoor displays yet, said Robert Bledsoe √ , director of marketing for Ontario-based LED display manufacturer Optec Displays.\nPREDICTING THE FUTURE?\nGreat Scott! It’s here!\nOct. 21, 2015: The date on which Michael J.

He orders a drink and up pops a Pepsi Perfect.\nIn reality: The product appears onscreen in a fancy curved bottled that never existed – until today, when Pepsi is selling 6,500 of them for $20.15 each. That price will surely rise in the immediate future to something as ridiculous as the hat the bully Griff is wearing when he walks into the cafe a minute later. So it’s a fact, if short-lived.\nExpert says: “Pepsi fans asked, and we heard them loud and clear,” said Lou Arbetter, senior director of marketing for PepsiCo, in a present-day news release.

Hicham El Guerrouj’s world record is a distant 3:43.13.\n“Washington prepares for Queen Diana’s visit.” Sadly fiction. Princess Diana died in a car crash in 1997, but even if she’d lived Queen Elizabeth still hasn’t stepped down from her throne.\n“President says she’s tired.” Fiction, for now, though Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Carly Fiorina are in the race for next year’s election.\n“Cubs sweep series in 5.” Also fiction for now, though this is the one that’s got the sports world abuzz. The hapless Cubs are actually alive in the postseason for the first time in many years, though after dropping the first three games of their National League Championship Series to the New York Mets they need to get it together if they’re to make the World Series, much less win one for the first time in 107 years.\nExpert says: You can’t “sweep in 5” anyway in our current best-of-seven-style series, according to, well, baseball fans.\nTIME MACHINE\nIn the movie: Marty travels to the past and the future in a DeLorean outfitted by his scientist pal Doc with a flux capacitor that can navigate the circuits of time.\nIn reality: Don’t hold your breath. And DeLoreans aren’t even rolling off assembly lines anymore, either.\nExpert says: Time travel is still, as far as anyone today knows, fantasy. “Fundamentally, it’s that no one has any ideas to get around the idea,” said Ward Beyermann, associate professor of physics and astronomy at UC Riverside. “Predicting the future is dangerous.
