TERRY PIERSON, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Related article » ABOUT THE SUPERINTENDENT\nName: Michael Hai-Han Lin\nAge: 49\nResidence: Chino Hills\nFamily: Married with two children: a 12-year-old boy and a 9-year-old girl\nPosition: Superintendent, Corona-Norco Unified School District\nEducational experience: 24 years\nWhen his parents uprooted him from Taiwan at 13, it was with the promise of a better education, a better future, in the U.S.\nThat was 1979, long before Michael Lin became an aerospace engineer, and even longer before he’d win national acclaim as leader of the Corona-Norco Unified School District.\nArmed with just a few English words, Lin began acclimating to the largely Hispanic culture of his adoptive hometown of Azusa. Foods, clothes, attitudes. All were vastly different from his boyhood home. Lin’s parents opened a restaurant that eventually failed, so they reverted to factory work as their son excelled academically.\n“One thing my parents had, whether you want to call it grit or sacrifice, was this belief that there’s hope for tomorrow, there’s light at the end of the tunnel,” Lin said last week, seated in his Norco office.\nAfter graduating from Cal Poly Pomona, Lin took a full-time position with Boeing aircrafts in Long Beach, writing computer programs to test jet propulsion systems. For three years, he toiled at a position that didn’t seem to fit, sticking with it at least in part to appease his parents.\n“I loved tech work, but I’m a people person,” Lin said. “I always had a love for working with kids.”\nAnd so, to the initial disappointment of his parents and the immediate reduction of his bank account, Lin took a job at Monrovia High School teaching math and coaching track.\nIt was during these first years in the classroom that he learned his most important lesson in education: “the material isn’t the most important part, it’s about paying attention to the individual.”\n“They’ll learn if they respect you,” Lin said. “They don’t want to disappoint.”\nLin gained a reputation at the high school for his energetic personality. Sam Perdomo – a childhood friend and classmate, fellow engineering student, and current principal at Foothill Middle School in Azusa – said Lin has always been driven.\n“He sets his mind on what he wants to do, and he pursues it completely,” Perdomo said. “He’s never been arrogant about any of his accomplishments. He’s just a really down to earth, humble guy.”\nIt’s an attribute he retains today.\nLEADER, MENTOR Elbows propped on an office table this week, pausing only for the occasional sip from his water bottle, Lin sped through the next 16 years of his life rapid fire: three years as a high school teacher and coach, several years as an assistant principal then personnel manager at Hacienda La Puente School District, the decade-plus spent as human resources director at Montebello Unified and Walnut Valley Unified school districts, eventually leading to his appointment as Corona-Norco’s superintendent in July 2012. All while raising two young children.\nBob Taylor, a fellow deputy superintendent in Corona-Norco, worked alongside Lin several years. Taylor, now superintendent at Walnut Valley, said Lin spent countless hours of free time in the hospital, visiting sick or injured employees and students.\n“Michael has shaped my outlook on my own behaviors, the way I try to present myself and the empathy I show other people,” Taylor said. “He’s taught a lot of people how to put themselves in someone else’s shoes. He’s a mentor to me.”\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwpb4q-b88541873z.120151023183422000ghdco4es.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwpb4r-b88541873z.120151023183422000ghdco4f2.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwpb4s-b88541873z.120151023183422000ghdco4eq.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwpb4r-b88541873z.120151023183422000ghdco4f0.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwpb4s-b88541873z.120151023183422000ghdco4eq.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwpb4r-b88541873z.120151023183422000ghdco4f2.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwpb4r-b88541873z.120151023183422000ghdco4f0.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwpb4q-b88541873z.120151023183422000ghdco4es.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwpb4q-b88541873z.120151023183422000ghdco4eu.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwpb4q-b88541873z.120151023183422000ghdco4eu.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:20:41.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
