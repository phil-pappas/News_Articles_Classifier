The Broadway-style romp is equal parts “West Side Story” and old-school hip-hop, and finds Macklemore rapping about his affinity for mopeds.\n“Downtown” is No. 15 on this week’s Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and has been streamed more than 43 million times on Spotify. The video has 35 million views on YouTube.\nThe duo’s still-untitled follow-up to 2012’s surprise smash “The Heist” is tentatively due out this fall, but no release date has been set.\nThe concert will be Macklemore and Lewis’ first area concert since a November 2013 performance at the Palace of Auburn Hills.\nagraham@detroitnews.com \n@grahamorama", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T15:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:50:00.078+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
