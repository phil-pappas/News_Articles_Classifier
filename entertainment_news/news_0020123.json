(Ian West/PA) \n“Every time there’s interesting, complex roles played by actresses on screen, someone says, ‘do you think this is a breakthrough?’ and ‘does this mean there’s going to be more of the same?’ We seem to find ourselves in the same conversation and that’s somehow remarkable,” Cate said. \n“I think there’s a swathe of great roles for women and certainly, there’s some wonderful female performers. It’s just time to get on with it really.” \nPhyllis and producer Elizabeth Karlsen have tried to bring Patricia’s book to screen for 10 years, only to suffer various disappointments until now. Promoted stories (Ian West/PA) \nCate, 46, hopes people will dismiss any political agenda with the film, as it focuses on the same-sex relationship between her character Carol Aird and Rooney’s alter-ego Therese Belivet. \nShe said: “I think even if this film had been made five or 10 years ago, it would have been perceived as being more political. (Ian West/PA) \n“The landscape and the conversation around same-sex relationships has advanced in many countries… so the universality of the love story comes to the fore, rather than the political agenda.” \nThe actress said it was a “relief” to carry out the love scenes with Rooney. (Joel Ryan/AP/PA) \n“Both characters are quite isolated – not only because their feelings set them apart from others, but the gap in their ages. They go through these volcanic feelings towards one another so it was a relief to do the scenes with Rooney. Finally we get to be together.” \nRooney said the chemistry came naturally: “Chemistry isn’t something you can create. As in real life, you either have it or you don’t. I felt lucky that it was easy for me to feel chemistry towards Cate.” (Joel Ryan/AP/PA) \nCate also dismissed her earlier quotes about her sexuality, when she said she had had “many” past relationships with women at the Cannes film festival in May. \nShe said: “If I was playing someone who had an affair, I think there would be a moment of pause before a journalist asked me how many affairs I have had. And if I was playing an axe murderer, they wouldn’t necessarily ask me how many people I’ve murdered. \n“I probably answered in a way that was a bit facetious and they took it literally. No offence, but I’m busy and I’ve got four kids.” Share article \nCarol opens in UK cinemas on November 27.
