Ford Presidential Museum, also was listed atop the Two-Dimensional category entries.\n“Once again, reverence for technical skill in two-dimensional work — this time in a stunning combination of large-scale photography and intricate textile — has captured the imagination of the voting public,” ArtPrize Executive Director Christian Gaines said in a statement. “It’s a surprising and unexpected twist to have ‘Northwood Awakening’ represent our first ever two-time public vote winner. We’re stunned and delighted, but we’re also reflecting on how this affects ArtPrize going forward.”\nAnn Loveless said she was “amazed” to take the top prize twice.\n“I feel like I’m really blessed with talent and I think I need to share them with other people,” she said. “I’m kind of brainstorming how I can maybe give back a little bit because I’ve been given so much.”\nThe competition served as a creative springboard, her husband said.\n“It’s tremendous that it can bring together such a diversity of artists and a very large audience,” Steven Loveless said. “It really helps artists grow so much as an artist, just because of those relationships that you build with how so many people see your art.”\nOther public vote winners, who each received $12,500, were: “Greatest Generation/Beta Team/November” by Fred Cogelow of Willmar, Minnesota, in the Three-Dimensional category; “REACH and SPLASH” by Andy Sacksteder of Port Clinton, Ohio, in the Installation category; and “Whisper,” by Emily Kennerk of Zionsville, Indiana, in the Time-based category.\nThe juried awards also were announced Friday. Gilmore won the Juried Grand Prize for a transformational performance juror Dan Cameron called “really kind of magical in a way that we’ve maybe lost sight of.”\nTo present her piece, Gilmore worked with the SiTE:LAB outfit, which converted an entire city block into a temporary arts district. At a house on Rumsey Street that once was a convent, women wearing white dresses and red shoes continually glided on swings near open windows. The exterior was painted pink, while bright lights illuminated the interior.\nThe inspiration, Gilmore said Friday night, “was thinking a lot about these nuns and a lot about their experience in the home and the community — just trying to figure out where their kind of body fit into this space.”\nShe said ArtPrize was not only rewarding financially, but offered her a new way to connect.\n“In one sense, it’s great that it’s making people look at art and it’s making it exciting for people,” she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T11:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T15:36:27.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
