The English team, ranked number one in Tests that time, had to face a shambolic defeat in three-match Test match series. And that was the last time these two teams met in the longest format of the game. Also Check- Full coverage of Pakistan vs England 2015 Spin was then Pakistan’s strength rather England’s weakness, and it remains so. The only thing that changes is Pakistan’s spin attack. Saeed Ajmal and Abdul Rehman were the wreckers-in-chief then, and now both are not part of Pakistan Test squad. However, this time around it is the leg-spin sensation Yasir Shah who is tipped to cause havoc in the opposition ranks as he did against Srilanka couple of months back. And consorting him will be Zulfiqar Babar. Sticking with the spin, England will have to neutralise the strong batting line-up of Pakistan on the dry pitches. Adil Rashid is the primary spinner in the side with Moeen Ali stacking up as a spinning all-rounder. England has also added all-rounder Samit Patel for this series. Ahead of the first Test, Pakistan suffered a blow with Azhar Ali being ruled out of the Abu Dhabi Test due to a foot infection. Azhar’s injury now gives an opportunity for either Fawad Alam or Shoaib Malik to make a comeback. However, given Malik’s all-around skills he is likely to be part of the playing XI. England after their Ashes victory at home will seek for dominance outside their comfort zone. Revenge of 2012 series will be on England’s agenda as well. Fun Fact: Pakistan’s batting mainstay Younis Khan needs 19 runs to become leading run-getter in Tests for his country. The right-hander is currently third on the list behind Javed Miandad and Inzamam-ul-Haq. Pakistan Squad: Misbah-ul-Haq (c), Fawad Alam, Wahab Riaz, Younis Khan, Shoaib Malik, Junaid Khan, Azhar Ali, Sarfraz Ahmed (wk), Rahat Ali, Mohammad Hafeez, Shan Masood, Imran Khan, Ahmed Shehzad, Yasir Shah, Asad Shafiq, Zulfiqar Babar. England Squad: Alastair Cook (C), James Taylor, Stuart Broad, Ian Bell, Moeen Ali, James Anderson, Joe Root, Samit Patel, Liam Plunkett, Alex Hales, Jos Buttler (wk), Steven Finn, Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow (wk), Mark Wood, Adil Rashid. \n  11:17 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:37:59.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
