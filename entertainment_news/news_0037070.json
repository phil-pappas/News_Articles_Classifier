Tyrod did a nice job yesterday, we split the reps, but as he came back in the evening, our doctors were looking at him and he still has some soreness in that knee so that means when you touch it and it's still sore, it hasn't healed. We're not going to force this young man and put him out there when he's really not 100 percent, so he won't play in the game.\"\nThis move makes sense because with the Bills heading to their bye week after this game, it provides Taylor extra rest and healing time, which may ensure that he can return to action when the Bills host Miami on Nov. 8.\n\"It's based on that he's not healed yet,\" said Ryan. \"We get that extra week so it makes sense, but we would have played him this week had it been healed, but it's not.\"\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nRex Ryan admits defensive plan was flawed\nRyan said that during Wednesday's practice, Taylor looked pretty good in the reps he took, but he added, \"I noticed that he was more arm, he wasn't stepping into the throws, especially early in the practice. As the practice went on he looked better to me, but clearly he wasn't 100 percent when we ran him.\"\nThus, Manuel gets his second start in a row, and he hopes that he'll be able to improve on an uneven performance against Cincinnati. \"For me, it's just about building off what I did last week,\" said Manuel. \"Making a throw here, a throw there, instead of looking at it on Monday and saying I wish I had done this, I wish I had done that on two or three plays that could have changed the game for us.\"\nManuel completed 28 of 42 passes for 263 yards with a touchdown, an interception, and a rushing touchdown, but the same problems that have held Manuel back in the past resurfaced. He was inconsistent in his decision-making, and his ball placement was poor on several throws. He was bailed out on a few throws by some great catches, two in particular by tight end Charles Clay.\n\"Overall consistency, that's it with him,\" offensive coordinator Greg Roman said of Manuel. \"And (accuracy) is part of it.\"\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nBills' live-stream may foreshadow future\nBuffalo Bills quarterback EJ Manuel takes part in an NFL training session at the Grove Hotel in Chandler's Cross, England, Thursday, Oct. 22, 2015.

Ryan announced that wide receiver Sammy Watkins, as expected, won't be playing. With Percy Harvin already out because he's not in London while reportedly contemplating his future in the NFL, and Marquise Goodwin gone for the year with a rib injury, the Bills have a serious issue in the passing game. The only viable receivers they have are Robert Woods and Chris Hogan, with newcomer Denarius Moore and special teams player Marcus Easley in reserve.\n“It's just life in the NFL, the best laid plans of mice and men. Injuries are a part of the game, we've been decimated by them, but we feel like we can adapt and survive.”\nGreg Roman, Bills OC Roman admitted it's a tough hand that Manuel has been dealt, but he has to push forward.\n\"It's just life in the NFL, the best laid plans of mice and men,\" said Roman. \"Injuries are a part of the game, we've been decimated by them, but we feel like we can adapt and survive and we just have to get through this period of time. We have plenty of other options and we have to play a style where we're not hurting ourselves with penalties and stopping drives that way. It changes the focus a little bit when you don't have some of your most explosive guys.\"\nRoman did say, though, that Manuel will be able to rely on running back LeSean McCoy.\n\"When you have one of the best running backs in the world, you can't measure that, it's critical,\" said Roman. \"Putting a plan together with a guy in mind, it's not just the player, McCoy, it's the offensive line, the tight ends, everybody. You're putting a plan together that they're trying to absorb and master, and if he's playing, we've got something, let alone on game day when you're giving him the ball.\"\nMAIORANA@Gannett.com\nSal's in London to cover the Bills vs. Jaguars game, but is London ready for Sal?
