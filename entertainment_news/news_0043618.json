And Philly guy Meek is ready to head west because TMZ's source says Meek believes it will keep him out of trouble. Because no one gets in trouble in Los Angeles. Box-office duds The pack of new releases this past weekend flopped like fighters in on the fix, leaving room for holdovers \"The Martian,\"\"Goosebumps\" and \"Bridge of Spies\" to stay in the top spots with $15.9 million, $15.5 million and $11 million, respectively, according to Rentrak estimates yesterday.\nVin Diesel 's \"The Last Witch Hunter\" will be the last \"Witch Hunter,\" tanking with $10.8 million, killing any hopes of a new franchise. \nNone of the weekend's flops will garner as much attention as \"Jem and the Holograms,\" though, which opened to $1.3 million to become one of the worst debuts of all time for a major studio movie opening in more than 2,000 locations. It was based on a 1980s animated series that Tattle had never heard of. \nBut at least it cost only $5 million to produce. \nBill Murray 's \"Rock the Kasbah\" barely did better in ticket sales, pulling in only $1.5 million from 2,012 theaters, but it also cost three times as much as \"Jem\" to make. It's one of Murray's worst debuts ever. \nAnd after two very strong limited-release weekends, \"Steve Jobs\" failed to impress in wide release with $7.3 million. That's on par with 2013's \"Jobs,\" which starred Ashton Kutcher and opened to $6.7 million despite much poorer reviews. \n\"Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension\" didn't do very well, either, with a franchise-low take of $8.2 million from 1,656 screens - more than 1,000 fewer than other films in the series. \nAlways looking for a bright spot, Paul Dergarabedian , Rentrak's senior media analyst, said the lackluster weekend at the box office could be the result of overcrowding, but Tattle believes that \"Witch Hunter,\"\"Jem\" and \"Kasbah\" could have been the only films at the multiplex and people still would have stayed home to carve pumpkins. TATTBITS * Will Smith is set to perform at the Latin Grammy Awards on Nov. 19. \nSmith will join Colombian band Bomba Estereo onstage for their remix of \"Fiesta\" at the MGM Grand, in Las Vegas. \nSmith and the group released the remix earlier this month. \n* The next day, Nov. 20, Adele will release the follow-up to her monumental \"21\" album. \nThe Grammy-winning singer said that \"25,\" her third album, is being preceded with the first single, \"Hello,\" which dropped Friday. \n\"My last record was a breakup record and if I had to label this one I would call it a makeup record,\" Adele said in a statement. \"I'm making up with myself. Making up for lost time. Making up for everything I ever did and never did.\" \nThank goodness Tony Bennett didn't name his albums this way, otherwise we'd have \"26,\"\"29,\"\"29-2,\"\"31,\"\"31-2,\"\"32,\"\"33,\"\"33-2,\"\"33-3\" . . . all the way to \"89.\" \n* Somebody at Disney-owned ABC may lose his job over this. \nThe overcrowded emergency room at CBS' \"Code Black\" will soon receive a special patient - from \"The Lion King.\" \nThe network and Disney Theatrical Productions said last week that Alton Fitzgerald White , who has played the role of Mufasa in the musical more than 4,000 times, will appear on the Nov. 25 episode of the medical drama starring Marcia Gay Harden . \nWhite will play a cast member of the touring musical who arrives at the hospital with a throat infection. Fellow cast members gather by his bedside and help other patients find peace. \nShow runner Michael Seitzman promises an episode that \"gives you chills.\" He said that cast and crew of the TV show were sobbing onset as the professional singers sang \"He Lives in You.\" \nAnd this didn't happen on \"Grey's Anatomy\" because? Synergy, people, synergy! There's a reason Princess Merida is now on ABC's \"Once Upon a Time.\" We want to see you see \"Brave.\" \nFrom Pixar.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T06:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T11:59:36.220+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
