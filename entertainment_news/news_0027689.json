The platform includes a committment to new and much-needed annual funding for CBC/Radio Canada, investment into the Canada Council for the Arts, Telefilm Canada, the National Film Board and new investments into cultural infrastructure. You can read more about the specifics of the platform by clicking here. \nIn addition, CIMA is excited about the new Liberal Government's policies that directly support the Canadian music industry's strategic goals of promoting and exporting our artists and their music, both domestically and around the world. CIMA and its members are looking forward to the restoration of the \"Promart\" and \"Trade Route International\" cultural promotion programs in particular. This new Liberal government investment of $25 million annually will serve to \"reinstate culture as part of our foreign diplomacy\", ensuring that Canadian artists can be heard around the globe. \nFurthermore, the Liberal Government has committed to a review of both the Broadcasting Act and the Copyright Act, and has noted the importance of reviewing the Copyright Board to ensure that decisions are made in a timely manner - all of which are CIMA priorities. \nABOUT CIMA: \nCelebrating its 40th year in 2015, CIMA is the not-for-profit national trade association representing the English-language, Canadian-owned sector of the music industry, and is the first organization of its kind in the world.
