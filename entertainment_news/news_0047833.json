Bella Swan's character is now a male named Beau and Edward Cullen\nis now a female named Edythe in the 442-page novel, titled \"Life and Death: Twilight Reimagined,\" available for purchase Tuesday. Meyer writes in her foreword to the anniversary edition of the book that the gender bending twist was prompted by her desire to stress that Bella isn't a \"damsel in distress,\" but a a \"human in distress.\"\nMeyer was set to release \" Midnight Sun ,\" a spinoff told from Edward's point of view, years ago, before a draft of the book leaked online. Fans were hoping that it would be included in the bonus content in this anniversary edition, but Meyers notes in the foreword that she didn't have the time to publish the story.\nÂ© 2015 Variety Media, LLC, a subsidiary of Penske Business Media; Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC", "external_links": ["http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=7&c2=6035310&c3=10000&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T02:48:00.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
