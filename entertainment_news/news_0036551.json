(Also Read: Rahul Gandhi raises special status to Andhra Pradesh with Narendra Modi) \n“He (Sam Pitroda) did the telecom revolution. He worked with the Prime Minister (Rajiv Gandhi). He worked on the Knowledge Commission. But for me, I haven’t seen much change in Sam.”In our country people achieve little bit and suddenly they become arrogant. They don’t talk to people with respect. They have airs about them. I have not seen that in Sam. He is still the same,” Gandhi said.Pitroda said for making the ‘Make in India’, an ambitious project initiated by Modi, successful, it is necessary to build infrastructure like good roads, power and have skilled labour. \nFormer Prime Minister Manmohan Singh recalled his association with Pitroda and said the journey from a small village in Odisha to become a leading technocrat in the country was indeed remarkable.A key policy maker when it came to technology during Rajiv Gandhi’s tenure, Pitroda played a key role in the telecom revolution of the country. He also headed the Knowledge Commission during the tenure of Manmohan Singh. \nModified Date: October 19, 2015 11:05 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:40:42.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
