Chris Christie or for that matter, even Jon Bon Jovi could be selected for the post. With the GOP in the House already in turmoil , either might not be such a bad choice.\nWhen The Auditor spotted Christie at a campaign stop in a New Hampshire lumberyard, getting his thoughts on this bizarre constitutional quirk became irresistible. (The Speaker is, after all, third in line for the presidency. Christie's polling in ninth place.)\nRELATED : Christie, evoking George W. Bush, takes a 'with us or against us' approach to foreign aid\nBut before the question could even be fully put to the governor, he looked directly into The Auditor's jaundiced eyes and declared he \"would rather jump off the Brooklyn Bridge\" than seek the job of House Speaker for himself.\nBut what about your friend Bon Jovi, governor? Having been recently been spurned, yet again, by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Bon Jovi would be an outsider, and outsiders are all the rage in the GOP these days. Just ask Ben Carson or Carly Fiorina .\nChristie could not have been less interested in such guessing games.\n\"I don't have a dream pick,\" said Christie, but he added, \"It would not be Jon . I don't think it would play to his strong suit. What I have is a dream for what Congress could be, which is actually a responsive body that gets something done. ... Whoever can do that as Speaker, that's who I'm for.\"\nMORE CHRIS CHRISTIE", "external_links": ["http://www.gallup.com/poll/1600/congress-public.aspx", "http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/memberfaq.aspx"], "published": "2015-10-09T20:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:12:16.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
