Pic/Santa Banta \nIn a new interview with BET, the \"Our Brand Is Crisis\" star, 51, said these were the important conversations to have and it was better to begin early.\n\"He fully understands what that means. He doesn't understand why people judge each other based on color of their skin, but he knows they do. He also knows there's sexism, he knows that there's homophobia,\" she said.\nThe actress said as a mother she would want to protect her son from all evils in the world but she also wants him to be aware about the reality.\n\"I want him to know the truth, but I also want him to know the good in the world as well. Those are hard conversations to have.\nIt's not any conversation any parent wants to have with their child, is that you'll be judged by the color of your skin rather than the content of your character. But it exists, and I want him to be safe and I want him to be aware.\n\"I think if you don't start the conversation early on, you're doing them a disservice. Once he leaves that house and I'm not with him, it's his life and how he approaches it is his decision. But I want to know that I did the best I could as his mom to educate him on the ugliness in the world, and also the beauty.\"\nBullock adopted Louis from New Orleans in 2010 amid her divorce from then-husband Jesse James. They had initially started the adaptation process together but after James' affairs came to light, the actress filed for divorce and proceeded to adopt the little boy as a single parent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:07:37.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
