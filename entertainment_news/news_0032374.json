(ABC Handout) Article \nThe roundup of the crazy happenings in the world of reality TV: \nBattles end with a steal: \n“Oh, it’s going to be a bloodbath,” Adam Levine said, provoking his fellow coaches when the final match-ups brought the battle rounds to an end on The Voice this week. Steals were used, singers swapped teams and the best of the best emerged victorious, securing the safety of the season’s top 32. Gwen Stefani matched 15-year-old Braiden Sunshine against 23-year-old Lyndsey Elm as the two faced off in the ring to Howard Jones’ No One Is to Blame. Their evenly-matched skills made it difficult for Gwen to make the eventual decision to stick with the youngest voice in the competition, whom she called “a diamond in the rough.” Team Adam’s electric twin duo Andi & Alex faced Texas-teen Chance Peña, as the three performers’ sang the Calling hit Wherever You Will Go so perfectly, their coach suggested they form a trio. While Adam decided to stay with Andi & Alex, Blake Shelton scooped up Chance for his team. And to end off the round, Team Blake’s Emily Ann Roberts and Morgan Frazier conquered Patty Loveless’ I’m That Kind of Girl, with their traditional country voices. Shelton picked Roberts as the clear winner, but Pharrell used the final steal of the battles to welcome Morgan to his promising crew. Rihanna arrives as a guest mentor when the Knockout rounds begin next week \nPaula Deen fails to impress: \nAll nine remaining couples reunited with their original partners following last week’s switch-up to deliver some of pop culture’s most iconic dances from classic films, musicals and even the VMAs, when Dancing with the Stars continued. As someone who knows a thing or two about classic choreography, Olivia Newton-John served as a fitting guest judge to hand out some good grades that rewarded an impressive three pairs with perfect scores. Despite Tamar Braxton’s minor sickness that held her back in rehearsals, the R&B singer and professional partner Val Chmerkovskiy delivered a seamless jazz routine to Janet Jackson’s epic Rhythm Nation that wowed the judges and earned viral acclaim online. Bindi Irwin and Derek Hough paid homage to Dirty Dancing and claimed their perfect score with a crowd-pleasing rumba. \"Your legs were on fire,” Julianne gushed to Bindi. And Andy Grammer continued to prove his worth in the competition with a faultless upgrade to Singin’ in the Rain, alongside pro-partner Allison Holker. \"For many people this is considered to be the best musical of all time. It takes balls to take that on. You succeeded,” Judge Bruno Tonioli praised. But for some duos, the week proved less than memorable, when Paula Deen and Alexa PenaVega landed side-by-side at the bottom of the pack. While Alexa and Mark Ballas recreated the historic Britney Spears I’m a Slave 4 U performance, the duo failed to live up to the hype and only received a 30/40. But it was the 68-year-old cooking star and her partner Louis van Amstel who were ousted from the competition after performing an awkward jazz routine inspired by the Madonna’s 1990 VMA performance of Vogue. \nReunion part one: \nThe first instalment of The Real Housewives of Orange County’s tenth season reunion was quite a yawn and lacking in all the catty insults, screaming matches and threats that made previous reunions so juicy. Instead, the ladies answered viewer questions, defended Christian values and Tamra Judge finally opened up for the first time publically about her nasty custody battle with ex-husband Simon Barney and estranged daughter, Sidney. “The whole family is so separated,” she cried to reunion mediator Andy Cohen. ““When your child turns their back on you, it’s humiliating. A couple months later, I’m in the press and he’s saying I’m a monster mom and that my kids should be taken away from me.” Although supportive for the time being, the ladies rustle feathers when the reunion show promises to heat up during next week’s conclusion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:59:40.119+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
