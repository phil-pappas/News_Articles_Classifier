Hof has been called out by Khloe Kardashian for seeking publicity after Lamar Odom’s near-death experience at one of his businesses. Khloe Kardashian says Nevada brothel owner Denis Hof is a publicity pimp, too.\nThe reality show star fired back Thursday after Hof sneered at her request to ignore the media horde covering estranged husband Lamar Odom’s near-death experience at the Love Ranch Vegas.\n“We reached out to Dennis politely asking him to respect Lamar’s (and Khloe’s) privacy during this difficult time and refrain from talking to the press,” said a statement from Kardashian’s publicist.\n“This is a very painful situation, as I know you are aware, and the idea that anyone would use it to seek publicity is really sad.”\nHof had his own pointed response to the Wednesday call for media silence from Kardashian’s publicist.\n“They asked me not to talk to the media,” the celebrity brothel owner told the Daily News. “I told her to pass on a message: Go to hell.”\nRobin Marchant/Getty Images Khloe Kardashian’s publicist said they reached out to Hof politely asking him to respect their privacy. Hof responded by telling the reality star to “go to hell.” Odom, 35, was found unconscious inside a private villa rented by the two-time NBA champion last weekend at Hof’s business. The 6-foot-10 forward was found facedown and frothing at the mouth Tuesday by two blonde hookers hired by the Queens native.\nKardashian and Odom were featured on the reality program “Khloe & Lamar,” and he continued to appear on the “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” show.\nHof questioned the sincerity of Kardashian, who filed for divorce in 2013 after four years of marriage. She rushed to Odom’s Las Vegas hospital bedside after he was placed on life support.\n“If she really cared about this man, he wouldn't be at my place with my girls,” said Hof, whose own reality show about the sex business airs on HBO.\nlmcshane@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories Kim K cancels baby shower in wake of Odom hospitalization Rob Kardashian, Kris Jenner 'praying' for Lamar Odom Nevada brothel owner to Khloe Kardashian: Go to hell", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:51:40.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
