While on a sailing trip to Alaska in 1931, actor John Barrymore stole the totem pole from an unoccupied village where it ended up in his California estate. After changing hands, the totem pole was donated to the Honolulu Museum of Arts in the early 1980's where it has remained since. The Museum gave the totem pole back to members of the Tribe today.
