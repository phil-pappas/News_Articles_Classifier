Three outstanding (and overlapping) Bay Area bands connected to that exploratory legacy perform at Cafe Pink House's INFusion Festival, the latest endeavor by the South Bay jazz scene's most exciting new venue. \nThe mini-festival kicks off Thursday with the Aaron Germain Group, a quartet led by the supremely versatile San Francisco bassist. The band features drummer Jeff Marrs, guitarist Jeff Massanari and keyboardist Matt Clark. Equally adept on acoustic and electric bass, Germain draws on an international array of traditions, influences he's acquired as a top-shelf sideman accompanying Caribbean steel drum combos and calypso singers, Afro-Cuban ensembles, North Indian kathak dancers, and Brazilian forro bands.

Few Bay Area musician have done more to push fusion in creative directions in recent decades than Schnalle, though he hasn't always embraced the term. \n\"I went through years of dodging the fusion label the best I could,\" Schnalle says. \"But it should be honorable to fuse elements together. Going back to the 1970s, early fusion wasn't just about chops-driven solos over a rock groove. I see a bigger picture.\" \nSteeped in straight ahead jazz, Schnalle reduced the quartet featured on his consistently smart 2014 album \"Idiot Fish\" to a trio with Vitchev and bassist Dan Robbins, partly due to economics and partly to open up space for his use of electronics. Adding textural elements and melodic motifs that he triggers from his drum kit, he employs the programming to give IF3 a full, multihued sonic palette. \n\"With the electronics I'm thinking melodically,\" Schnalle says. \"I'm working on some ways of composing with Hristo so that I'm creating pentatonic melodic structures on the drums that fit lots of chord changes.\" \nThe Bay Area jazz scene can feel like an extended family, and within the ranks of musicians who play music that fits comfortably under the fusion umbrella, it seems more than cozy. Schnalle has worked extensively with Germain, and he's holding down the drum chair Saturday with Zinn, who's played on many of the drummer's albums. \nIt's a toss up to say whether Zinn is more respected as a player with a pristine, folk-inspired compositional vision or an educator who has helped shape some of the region's most creative saxophonists. His former students include thriving professionals Dayna Stephens, Hitomi Oba, Jesse Scheinin and Remy Le Boeuf. \nZinn's singular sound as a bandleader made a striking impression a few weeks ago at the Monterey Jazz Festival, where he played a riveting set featuring the music and trio from his gorgeous 2014 album \"Shangri La\" with Australian-born, Benicia-based guitarist Chris Robinson and drumming great Peter Erskine. For Saturday's show, he's reaching back to his 2007 album \"Wish\" with a Bay Area dream team of Vitchev, Schnalle, pianist Frank Martin, bassist Mark van Wageningen, and percussionist Brian Rice. \n\"It's the first album of his I heard, and I fell in love with it before I even met Dann,\" Vitchev says. \"When I did the 'Desert Island' show with Alisa Clancey on KCSM, that was one of the records I chose.\" Contact Andrew Gilbert at jazzscribe@aol.com .
