Set in present day, “Novek” is a mind-bending, sci-fi thriller that follows four characters through the end of space and time. A large, “Void” appears in the furthest reaches of the universe and is growing larger every day as it consumes everything in its path. In six weeks it will reach Earth, and no one has any idea what will happen when it gets here. Everything stops, society panics, and within weeks, the whole world begins to crumble. In the middle of these twisted turn of events are four characters whose fates are inextricably linked. There’s a prison doctor who struggles to overcome PTSD and a psychopath searching for redemption. There is also a criminal looking to find himself, and the daughter of a cult leader who is trying to get out from under the shadows of her father.\n“Novek” is more than just a cool short story. It’s an allegorical tale that explores the collective concerns about what people are facing right now, at this moment. But it brings it down to a more personal level. There are a lot of changes coming fast from Global Warming to disruptive technologies. All of this is having a dramatic impact on people’s lives and will continue to do so as society moves further into the unknown future. Needless to say, people are experiencing a lot of anxiety, excitement, fear, and optimism about what's to come. “Novek” takes all of this and wraps it up into a mind-bending psychological sci-fi thriller. However, before people can see this science fiction short, these filmmakers need help. That’s why they launched this Kickstarter campaign . The goal of this project is to raise $16,582 by November 12, 2015. The funds raised will go towards production costs, such as cast, crew, props, and more.\nTo help bring this film to life, please visit the Kickstarter campaign or click here . Perks will be delivered between February 2016 and August 2017.\nPlease keep in mind this is an “all-or-nothing” deal, which means if the campaign does not reach the funding goal then the project cannot move forward. So know that any amount given can make a difference, and this is an incredible opportunity to be a part of a special campaign! Help “Novek” reach the goal by sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks. The more people know about this, the more support the campaign will receive.\nContact: Jon Firman\nTitle: Director/Producer\nPhone: 410-245-4307\nemail: This email address is being protected from spambots.
