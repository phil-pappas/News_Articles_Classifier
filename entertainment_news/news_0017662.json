The album announcement coincides with confirmation of long awaited tour dates for Australia, UK and Europe. \nBlue Neighbourhood is the follow-up to Troye’s mini album Wild, which topped the iTunes charts in 57 countries. The six songs featured on that EP serve as act one on this expanded electronica opera that is Blue Neighbourhood. \nNext week Troye will release the third video in his Blue Neighbourhood Trilogy. \n“It’s all autobiographical,” says Troye of the album. “It takes place in both the suburbs of Perth where I’ve grown up, which I consider to be my blue neighbourhood, but then also in this fast-paced, crazy, whirlwind life that I’m now living in hotel rooms and planes. And it takes place inside the mind of a 20-year-old kid. I wanted to make sure that youthfulness was there; I worked mostly with really, really young people on this record.” \nYou can catch Troye on the following dates: \nThursday 12th November – Sydney – The Metro Sunday 15th November – Perth – Astor Theatre Thursday 19th November – London – 02 Islington Academy Tuesday 24th November – Paris – Le Fleche d’Or Thursday 26th November – Berlin – Gretchen Monday 30th November – Stockholm – Debaser Strand", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T12:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T12:33:58.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
