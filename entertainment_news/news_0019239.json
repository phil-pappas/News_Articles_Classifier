A garnish of fried sage leaves provides a lovely grace note. Another commendable feature of this recipe: It gives you something else to do with that small slab of siena-colored quince paste you picked up to serve with cheeses.\nWe could have cut the recipe in half, but we can see the benefit of stashing the remaining four meatloaves in the freezer, well-wrapped, for nights when you don't have time to cook or for holiday company.\nQuince paste is typically sold in the cheese department of larger grocery stores. Hay recommends serving them with a Dijonnaise sauce (mustard-mayo blend). We think whole-wheat couscous and a simple green salad would do nicely.\nRelated Article\nQuince-glazed Meatloaves Life & Entertainment Food", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-20T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:09:08.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
