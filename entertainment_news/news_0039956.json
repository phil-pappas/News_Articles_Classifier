All is vanity and chasing after the wind, until people come to the knowledge and understanding that there is a wonderful purpose for each individual and an amazing “meaning to life.”\nThat meaning is found in Ecclesiastes 12: 13, “All has been heard. The end of the matter is, Fear God – know that He is, revere and worship Him – and keep His commandments; for this is the whole of man (the full original purpose of His creation, the object of God’s providence, the root of character, the foundation of all happiness, the adjustment to all inharmonious circumstances and conditions under the sun), and the whole duty for every man.”\nLorene searched for the “meaning to life” for 28 years and almost lost her life in the process, until that radical life changing day when she encountered the love of God through Jesus and found the “meaning to life”.\nReaders who wish to experience this life changing work can purchase “My Search For the Meaning To Life” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708.\nAbout Page Publishing\nPage Publishing is a traditional New York based full-service publishing house that handles all of the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
