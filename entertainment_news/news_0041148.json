He is from a privileged background and attended military school,” she said. James Blunt led troops in Kosovo and filmed some of his experiences.

The order was later revoked. \nSadler said Blunt spoke about how nerve wracking his service was. \n“Headed into Pristina I found myself the lead troop with 30,000 people behind me which is quite high pressure because you think, ‘I hope I don’t turn right when I should turn left’,” Blunt said in the Sunday Night interview last night. \n“My job was to go out into an environment ahead of my commanders as their eyes and ears and be aware of my surroundings. \n“I took a camera and took footage of what we saw in Kosovo. \n“Couldn’t really film much of what was going on there because it was just too violent and too ugly.

It’s terrible and a life changing moment and I don’t think I’ll ever look at another human being in the same way.” \nEven though he was a leader in the British military and troops were expected to follow his directions, Sadler said socially they wouldn’t hesitate to give him grief so he’s used to sticking up for himself, a trait that has translated online. \n“All of this is so trivial to him, he’s been through harder, tougher things in life so he just doesn’t care. And I think that’s a good attitude and there’s not that many people with that kind of perspective.” \nBlunt, who is a judge on television show The X Factor , is known for giving as good as he gets on social media, and hitting back at haters who most celebrities tend not to acknowledge. \nIn fact his cheeky comebacks have actually garnered him fans who don’t even like his music. I look bigger with a gun. https://t.co/AfwczItm4w — James Blunt (@JamesBlunt) September 5, 2015 Can’t stand your face but thanks for the compliment RT @BWillett87 : @JamesBlunt can't stand your music but your comebacks are second to none — James Blunt (@JamesBlunt) July 31, 2015 \nBut this intense military background and a knack for penning melancholic songs are definitely not all that Blunt is about. \n“I think what’s interesting about him is how much he lives for the day. He’s married and 40, but he loves to party,” Sadler said. \n“He loves his dance music ... he took us to his favourite nightclub, which was an eye opener ... everybody knew him and were saying ‘hey James’.” \n“He was a whole lot of fun.” \nBut Sadler said the thing that surprised her the most about Blunt was how polite he was. \n“He is probably the most polite man I have ever met in my life,” she said. \n“He is not putting it on for the tele, his manners were extraordinary. He would never speak over the top of you, he would go out of his way to make sure you were okay with everything.” \nShe said his empathy and compassion came through. \n“He was a delight to be around ... it wasn’t all about him, he was all about helping us and being part of a team, which I’m sure comes from his military background.” Sunday Night report Rahni Sadler with Blunt in Ibiza.
