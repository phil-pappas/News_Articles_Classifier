That’s not only due to her progeny but because she was the mathematical genius now credited with conceiving the first algorithm for computer programming, in the 1840s.\nThere’s a great deal more there than even the prolific Gunderson can cram into the Central Works world premiere (co-produced with Playwrights Foundation ) that opened Saturday, Oct. 17. For those who know a fair amount about Ada or her father’s scandalous life, and aren’t sticklers for historical correctness, there are some sly delights in Gunderson’s offhand allusions to her teenage “indiscretion” (presumably when she tried to elope with her tutor) or her father’s affair with his half-sister Augusta (after whom Ada was officially named), which prompted his flight to Europe and resulted in Ada’s cousin being also her secret half sister.\nThose who don’t know what they’re missing needn’t worry. Gunderson finds plenty of intriguing matter in the part of the story she tells, zeroing in on the knowns and unknowns in the relationship between Ada and Charles Babbage , the mathematician and engineer who came up with the idea for a programmable computer. Even on an unusually problematic opening night — the combination of a loud wedding reception upstairs at the Berkeley City Club and the cast’s clipped English accents bouncing off the theater’s stucco walls, making some of the dialogue unintelligible — Gunderson’s wit and the actors made the story pretty irresistible.\nKathryn Zdan inhabits the title role with an infectious intellectual zeal, split — when we meet her as a young woman — between the visceral thrills she finds in math and her father’s forbidden poetry. There’s an electric undercurrent of eroticism in her chatter about prime numbers and algorithms with Kevin Clarke ’s ever-more-enchanted Babbage at their first meeting. The palpable thrills she experiences as they develop the possibilities of his proto-computer Analytic Engine add zest to what could be pretty dry material. But so does Gunderson’s focus on Ada’s excitement at a computer’s aesthetic possibilities.\nThe sexiness of numbers also sets up a clever contrast with the more businesslike aspects of Ada’s courtship and marriage with Lord Lovelace (a suitably handsome, well-meaning Josh Schell ). That role could be more fully developed, as could the mostly unpleasant role of Ada’s mother, played by Jan Zvaifler with deep disapproval and an eagle eye for any sign that her daughter may have inherited any of her despised ex-husband’s sexual or poetic tendencies.\nBut the poetic resonances of Ada’s math-romance enthusiasms hold sway, buoyed by the computational cleverness of a score by the Kilbanes ( Kate Kilbane and Dan Moses ) and some clever period choreography by Travis Santell Rowland . Even as Ada begins to succumb to the cancer that would kill her (at 36, the same age as her father), Zdan keeps her passion burning bright. \nRobert Hurwitt is The San Francisco Chronicle ’s theater critic.
