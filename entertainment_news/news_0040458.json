While we know there's so many memes and so little time, trust, these ones are totally worth wasting your time on.\nIn case you missed it, last night, Drake dropped the video for his latest tune \"Hotline Bling,\" a song that may or may not have been appropriated from a Virginia rapper's single \"Cha Cha.\" It's a nifty enough clip.

Luckily, like everything online, lampoonery eventually follows listlessness, making things infinitely more interesting. Such is the case here. This morning, the world woke up to a new hashtag, #DrakeAlwaysOnBeat, populated with a slew of recontextualized clips, which zero in on a 15-30 second section in which Drake cuts a rug in time with various cuts, from Vince Guaraldi's \"Linus and Lucy\" to \"The Cosby Show\" theme song.
