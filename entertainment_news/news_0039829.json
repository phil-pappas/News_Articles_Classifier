The foundation's gift will support the Oncology Division at the Stanford's School of Medicine's ongoing research of immunotherapy for gastric cancer. The donation will help to further what is a relatively new but promising procedure. \nThe funds given by Liz and Eric Lefkofsky will be distributed under the direction of the Assistant Professor of Medicine (Oncology) at the Stanford University Medical Center, Pamela L. Kunz . Stanford Medicine Cancer Institute's continued research in immunotherapy has yielded some exciting developments. The research will focus on the effectiveness of epacadostat and pembrolizumab in gastric cancer. Pembrolizumab has been approved to treat melanoma that cannot be removed with surgery or has metastasized; Epacadostat has been tested in clinical trials to treat fallopian tube, malignant melanoma, and ovarian cancers. The study will determine whether the possibility to combine epacadostat and pembrolizumb could handle the sicknesses, which has been defiant to typical protocols in the past. The Lefkofsky Family Foundation's donation allows Stanford Medicine staff to further their research in determining whether this combination therapy can be successful. \nGastric cancer is one of the most common cancer-related deaths in the world. Currently, patients with the sickness are treated with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and highly-invasive complete surgical resection. These procedures have provided little success increasing the survival rate of patients stricken with the disease. However, recent advances in medicine may make this standard protocol a thing of the past. For example, Immunotherapy uses the body's own immune system to target and destroy tumor cells and have shown success in certain types of illnesses, such as breast cancer. Also, in treating lung cancer, patients who underwent this kind of treatment versus chemotherapy had double the survival rate. It is possible that the funds Eric Lefkofsky provides for immunotherapy can be used to treat other resistant types of infections and improve the survival rates of patients as well as their quality of lives with a treatment that is not as invasive. \nAbout Lefkofsky Family Foundation \nThe Lefkofsky Family Foundation is a private charitable foundation that was established in 2006 by Liz and Eric Lefkofsky .
