Debuted during the latest episode of \" Gotham \", the new promo asks the question which should be heard from Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) instead of Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ): What if it's all a lie? However, it's Mulder who now questions the truth about the mysterious cases they're working on. \"What if our work, the X-files, everything we're been led to believe in is a lie?\" he asks someone over the phone. Still, he has to find the way to find out the truth. In addition to a glimpse of Mulder and Scully back in action, fans get to see a strange girl brushing her long hair, a man whose skin is peeling off and two bodies dragged in a dark room. Duchovny and Anderson are joined by new cast member Joel McHale as Tad O'Malley, a conservative talk show host who becomes an unlikely ally to Mulder. Together with Scully, they are investigating the curious case of a possible alien abductee, portrayed by Annet Mahendru. Other original stars returning for the revival include Annabeth Gish (Monica Reyes), Mitch Pileggi (Walter Skinner), William B. Davis (The Smoking Man), Dean Haglund (Langly), Tom Braidwood (Frohike) and Bruce Harwood (Byers). The six-episode event series will launch with a two-night premiere on Sunday, January 24 and Monday, January 25 on FOX. A new poster for the show was recently released via TVLine . \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T05:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:52:54.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
