It said it had begun the search for a permanent replacement for Larsson.\nThe announcements came after U.S. markets closed. In after-hours trade, shares of Ralph Lauren rose 3.9 percent to $108.10 and Gap fell 3.4 percent to $29.20.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T22:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:13:35.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
