That’s the key word,” Moede said.\nAlthough no records have been broken, temperatures on Friday were about 20 degrees higher than is normal for this time of year.\nWeak Santa Ana winds were reported in the Banning area, with gusts up to 30 mph.\nThe combination of Santa Ana winds and high temperatures has proven deadly in the past, especially in October 2007 when fires that broke out up and down the Interstate 15 corridor caused millions of dollars in damage.\nMoede said temperatures are expected to drop about another 5 degrees Sunday but said a significant cooling trend is not expected until Thursday or Friday.\nRiverside and San Bernardino counties issued heat advisories for the weekend.\n“While this magnitude of heat is not especially unusual, the recent cool weather could cause some people to be caught off-guard, especially those most susceptible to heat illness,” San Bernardino County Health Officer Dr. Maxwell Ohikhuare said.\nHealth officials warned that the elderly, infants and children, people who work or exercise outside and people with chronic medical conditions should take precautions in the extreme heat to keep from getting heat exhaustion or heat stroke.\nInland residents are advised to reschedule strenuous activities to the early morning or evening, wear lightweight and loose-fitting clothing and drink plenty of water.\nAnthony Coletta, emergency services manager for the Riverside Fire Department, said the city has not added extra staffing for the weekend but has additional fire crews on call for emergencies.\n“Our procedures allow us to recall additional personnel when we need to,” Coletta said.\nColetta said city cool centers, which are located in libraries, senior centers and community centers, would be open during normal business hours.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:14:58.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
