Give yourself a rim shot (hey, digi digi) and enjoy the next seven minutes of your life listening to this.\nThe remix is from Badu's forthcoming mixtape , BUT YOU CAINT USE MY PHONE, which can't get here fast enough.", "external_links": ["https://vine.co/v/MgIPAH9ZMgY/embed/simple", "https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/226458560&color=ff5500", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iIICHxKV30", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uq1jtsHcgk", "http://genius.com/3020237"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:43:12.955+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
