This video, compiled by Auralnauts, shows every on-screen kill from Dr. No all the way up to Skyfall.\nTotalling 363 kills, including 84 from explosions and 9 with his bare hands, it seems 'oul Bond's a dab hand at offing people.\nThe video also counts some of his 'killer' puns.\nTake a look.\nOur favourite? Has to be when he gets Oddjob with the electric cable in Goldfinger. Either that or when Sean Bean dies in GoldenEye from the falling satellite.\nPoor Sean Bean. Had to expect it, though.\nVia YouTube\nMORE: Daniel Craig says he's NOT done with James Bond just yet\nMORE: Daniel Craig says he'd rather self-harm than do another Bond movie\nMORE: Sean Connery was supposed to have a MUCH bigger role in Skyfall", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/QQa_4biNkWU", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/QQa_4biNkWU&quot;"], "published": "2015-10-12T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:25:18.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
