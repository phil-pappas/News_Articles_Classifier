Photo: Graham Tidy\n\"A lot of our patients do get outside but we can't get them as far as Floriade so it's just beautiful that Floriade comes to them.\"\nShe said while many patients received flowers, some don't and for them it's a touching gesture.\n\"My staff know they're coming and there's a level of excitement when the flowers come. It's different for the patients, they weren't here last year so it'll be a new thing for them,\" she said.\n\"We've got lovely volunteers who do a lot of flower arranging for us. We generally hand them over to the volunteers and within no time they've made beautiful floral displays and they pop up all over the hospice. It's beautiful.\"\nGoodwin Aged Care's chief executive, Sue Levy, said: \"The flowers have been very happily received by residents\".\n\"Connection with the community is also an important aspect of residents' wellbeing. We're grateful to Floriade for reaching out to Goodwin, and providing a way to bring a little bit of Floriade to those who are unable to attend the event,\" she said.\nEvents ACT's Naomi Fallon said it was another strong year for the annual spring celebration.\n\"We've had another hugely successful year. Hundreds of thousands of people have come through the gates of Floriade,\" she said.\n\"We cut flowers and deliver them to people because we don't want them to go to waste. There's a lot of people who would love to come to Floriade but haven't had the opportunity because they've been unwell so this enables us to share Floriade with everyone.\"\nBut it's not just in wards and on windowsills that Floriade will live on.\n\"Volunteers are really important to us at Floriade. Last night we had a function to thank them and they began the process of digging up the flower beds so they could take home a piece of Floriade with them and plant it in their own garden,\" Ms Fallon said.\n\"What is really beautiful about Floriade is there are pieces of Floriade all around Canberra growing and blooming in different gardens.\"\nCommonwealth Park will reopen to the public on October 26.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T11:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:09:15.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
