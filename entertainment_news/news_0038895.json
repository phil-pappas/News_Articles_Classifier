Wear a wife beater around the house. Walk around with a hammer or a screwdriver like I'm gonna fix the door or something. Fix the garage,\" the father of four tells DeGeneres. \n\"Like pretending to fix the door? Like ding-dong I'm here, lady!\" Ellen asks. \n\"The handy man, yeah,\" confirms Wahlberg. \nThe 44-year-old actor also revealed how he stays in such great shape, which he admits takes a lot of discipline. \n\"I wake up at three. I go down to the kitchen, I make egg whites and [whole grain] bread, almond butter with a little avocado,\" he explains. \"I go downstairs, work out for about an hour...I come up, have a shake, I make a salad, my food-to-go in the morning...Then I have turkey burgers and sweet potato and then I go to the golf course at six o'clock, play 'til eight o'clock.\" \nWahlberg then \"rushes home,\" which is when he and his wife have their \"alone time.\" \n\"And then I'm in bed by seven, my wife things I'm an old bore,\" he adds. \nThe talk show host had Wahlberg show off his muscles, challenging him to do as many pull-ups as he could in 30 seconds to raise money for breast cancer research. Mark managed a total of 22, for a total of $20,000. Ellen bumped up the total to $25,000. \nWahlberg will star opposite Will Ferrell in the big-screen comedy Daddy's Home , opening nationwide Christmas Day. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
