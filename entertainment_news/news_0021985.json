Photo: Nick Cubbin \nSecond Half First\nDrusilla Modjeska\nKnopf, $39.99  \nDrusilla Modjeska's memoir of her past 30 years, Second Half First , is marked by loss and yet is a story of growth and unexpected pleasures. It opens in Sydney with a lover dumping her on the eve of her fortieth birthday and ends with the recent death of another man after a long relationship. In between, she cares for her dying father, a judge and writer, in England.\n\"The death of my father was very hard,\" she says. \"The father in a lot of women's lives is protective: if I end up in a foreign jail he'll come and get me out, which is sort of ridiculous, but it's probably an indication of him as a good father, for all his reserve, that I felt safe trotting off across the world because he was there.\"\nSecond Half First by Drusilla Modjeska. \nModjeska left England at 20 when her new husband's work as an anthropologist took them to Port Moresby and later to Sydney, where she stayed after the marriage ended.\nAdvertisement \"Going to New Guinea in 1968 changed my life,\" she says. \"Having grown up with imperialism and great-uncles who had worked in the Indian civil service, suddenly I understood colonialism and the world switched on its axis. It was the first time I took myself seriously; my reading changed and something in me was born that went on to be a writer.\"\nHer genre-breaking, award-winning books have explored the tensions between freedom, love and creativity in her own and other women's lives. Best known are Poppy , the partly fictionalised biography of her mother, The Orchard , the fable-memoir of a woman's middle years,  and Stravinsky's Lunch , about the Australian artists Grace Cossington Smith and Stella Bowen.\n\"I got into trouble at an early stage for making up stories,\" she says, remembering her childhood distress when visitors sat on her imaginary friends. She studied history but friends say she often answers questions, \"Yes, no, but\". Hers is an elegantly questioning, layered writing style.\nSecond Half First continues the familiar themes but Modjeska says it sticks to the facts. As well as romantic love and independence, she writes about friendship with young women and housemates such as writer Helen Garner. Her houses are characters too, and she still lives in \"the house in the lane\", a weatherboard cottage vivid with art, books and flowers.\n\"Home\" remains a question after almost 50 years â€“ Australia or England? \"I feel very Australian,\" she says, still sounding more lark than lorikeet. \"I'd rather my ashes were here but in a weird way I feel I'd like to have my sister and my nieces around when I die.\"\nPapua New Guinea is a third home, since she returned a decade ago and became involved with preserving the barkcloth art of the Omie women in the highlands. She has established a literacy program called Sustain Education Art Melanesia (SEAM), which will soon supply specially designed mobile schools-in-a-box.\n\"I love the environment, the culture, the people, but I also saw how the longing for literacy was so powerful. I can't tell you how moving it was to go back to the village with the books [they had made]; the kids did not go to sleep.\"\nModjeska's first novel, The Mountain (2010), was set in Papua New Guinea and she was working on another, about a female journalist, when the need to write her own story overcame her. Memoir is her most natural form. \n\"It's the only way I can understand myself, my life or what any of it means,\" she says. She turns 69 this month as the book appears and has recovered from her grief and a brush with breast cancer. \n\"I have a much greater sense of who I am and not having to apologise for it,\" she says. \"I don't feel I'm anywhere near the end, which might be completely delusional, but I feel more alive and grounded than I have for a long time. I think I have a couple more books in me. I feel much less afraid of death and I kind of think when it comes it will be OK.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:33:03.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
