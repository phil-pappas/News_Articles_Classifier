Alek Skarlatos Has Injured His Nose During Dancing with the Stars Rehearsal Another injury has struck on Dancing with the Stars.... Comment Posted Oct. 12, 2015 at 5:10 PM Updated at 8:56 PM Posted Oct. 12, 2015 at 5:10 PM Updated at 8:56 PM Another injury has struck on Dancing with the Stars . Alek Skarlatos has suffered a nose injury just a few hours before Monday night's Switch-Up Week competition, when his partner Emma Slater accidentally elbowed him in the face during rehearsal. After being checked out by doctors it was determined that the show will go on with Skarlatos as planned. \"Alek will be performing in tonight's show and the official diagnosis is expected tomorrow,\" a spokesperson told People . Skarlatos' injury comes two weeks after Kim Zolciak suffered a mini stroke and was unable to compete, and therefore cut from the show. Bindi Irwin has also been dancing despite foot pain. Derek Hough: The response to Bindi's dance is \"beautiful and lovely\" It has been an incredibly challenging few months for Skarlatos, who stopped a terror attack on a Paris-bound train in August. He returned home to Oregon earlier this month following a mass shooting at Umpqua Community College campus, where he had been registered to attend class, and recently visited his friend Spencer Stone in the hospital. Stone, who helped to take down the gunman on the train, was recently stabbed multiple times while protecting a woman during a street fight. Dancing with the Stars airs Mondays at 8/7c on ABC.
