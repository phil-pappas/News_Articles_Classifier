This, of course, causes owners to wonder what’s up when Fido acts finicky when the food bowl is presented.\nFirst things first, you want to make sure your four-legged family member is healthy. If your dog is typically a good eater and excited about meal time but now shows signs of pickiness, he or she may be experiencing some discomfort or illness, which can cause the most enthusiastic eater to want to turn his or her nose up at the bowl.\nCheck the mouth for sores, gum growths or bad teeth, and if any are present consult your veterinarian. If no open wounds or sores are found and your dog seems lethargic and continues to not eat anything for more than a day, consider visiting your vet.\nHealthy dogs may go without eating for one or two days without any issues. (However, puppies or diabetic dogs should not skip meals for their health.) Dogs who have been fed a lot of treats throughout the day, or extra food at a previous meal, might not feel like eating come the next mealtime. Their appetites will return when they are hungry again. If this appears to be happening with some regularity evaluate how much you are feeding at each meal — if you are overfeeding, your dog may be letting you know that he or she is still full when it’s time to eat again.\nSo, what if you have a dog that is not overly enthused with his or her food when it’s time to eat?\nIf your dog is in the percentage that eats to live instead of lives to eat, there are a few little tricks that pet parents can implement to help increase their dogs’ food drive.\nA dog’s strongest sense is smell, which is about 1,000 times that of a human. It’s the scent of food that attracts the dog to eat it. This being said, if your dog does not like the smell of the food being presented, he or she will likely not want to eat it.\nConsider the quality, and hence the aroma, of the food you are feeding. Ingredients such as corn, wheat, soy and by-products are cheap fillers that are not easily digested by dogs, and they do not have a high meat content. Dogs, by nature, are carnivorous, meaning they really need a lot of meat in their diets. Foods that contain fillers and by-products and are low in actual meat content frequently lack the “real meat” smell appeal that your dog is searching for. In some cases, low-quality foods are sprayed with a fat coating to make the food smell more appealing, but this does little to improve its nutritional content.\nFeeding times can play a role in finickiness. With Free-Feeding, or leaving food down all the time 24/7, the pet will expect that food is always available. If your dog becomes picky with the food he or she may just keep waiting for something better to come along.\nIn this case try feeding your pet on a consistent schedule instead, placing the bowl down and then taking it back up after a certain period of time, between 10-20 minutes or so, if it has not been eaten. Repeat this process at the next meal, and after a little while your dog will realize he or she only has a certain time to eat.\nYou can also add a small amount of a higher-value food to the bowl to encourage your dog to eat at meal time. Canned, freeze-dried and raw foods are very appealing add-ins. Most dogs find it difficult to resist a scoop of canned food or some freeze dried nuggets on top of their kibble. You can also stir in the additions to coat the dry food.\nAvoid using people food and table scraps as add-ins, as your dog is likely to hold out for more of them instead of eating his or her kibble. Also resist the temptation to give some table scraps to a dog that does not eat his or her meal, as that is only reinforcing the behavior you’re trying to break!\nOwners can also work on some training and behavioral issues to help entice their picky pets to eat. Exercise is always valuable for your pet. It helps keeps them lean, active, and it helps with hunger! After exercising, pets will usually have more of an appetite rather than if they spent their whole day lying around. Getting your pet out and about and being active will help their food drive.\nPositive reinforcement is also another training technique that can be implemented with these picky pups. Be sure that whenever your picky dog eats his meal, you reward him. If your dog craves attention, after he or she finishes a meal praise and pet him or her for eating.\nRose Casesi is the manager of TailsSpin Pet Food & Accessories.
