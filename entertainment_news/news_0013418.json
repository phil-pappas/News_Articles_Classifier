Immigration and Refugee Board spokesman Robert Gervais confirms the arrest and says Quaid will have a detention review hearing Thursday. Officials are unable to give further details. \nQuaid told The Associated Press he has a deportation order for Tuesday, and Thursday's hearing is about whether he can remain in Canada. \nQuaid and his Canadian wife fled the U.S. in 2010, saying they were victims of persecution. They've sought to stay in Canada and have said they were being hunted by \"Hollywood star-whackers,\" but they face legal problems in the U.S. \nQuaid's bid for permanent residency in Canada was denied in 2012.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:30:34.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
