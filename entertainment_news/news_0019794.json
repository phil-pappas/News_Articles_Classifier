That's impressive too. I think this is just a matter of taste.\" \nBrown, a graduate of Baldwin County Virtual School, s aid she got her start singing karaoke at the local Gulf Bowl bowling alley, but has since become a regular performer there. During the blind auditions, Brown blew all of the judges away with a performance of \"Stars\" by Grace Potter before selecting the Maroon 5 frontman as her coach. \nNow that she's survived the battle rounds, Brown will go head-to-head against other teams during the knockout rounds. \"The Voice\" airs at 7 p.m. CST on Mondays and 8 p.m. CST on Tuesdays on NBC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T17:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T18:11:44.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
