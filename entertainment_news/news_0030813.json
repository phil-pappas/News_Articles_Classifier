Rough cut (no reporter narration). ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript \nROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) Issey Miyake new Spring/Summer collection unveiled on Friday (October 2) high-tech three dimensional colourful clothing made of fabric pleated in the oven through a procedure similar to baking bread. The new innovative process - called \"Baked Stretch\" - gives the fabric a new form and a softer texture. The high temperature makes the glue mold the pleat into the fabric and create a pleated garment. This procedure creates a new kind of fabric gathering which gives garments a unique flow on the catwalk. Models wore dresses, knee-length skirts and tops made of pleated fabric. Colours ranged from electric blue to lobster-red to brown to purple, to green. The collection, named \"Botanical Delights\" was inspired by the tropical flora in the jungle. Creations included also dresses, bags, skirt and jackets decorated with fringes and details made of paper from plants and intended to give to the cloths dynamism and vitality. Paris Fashion Week runs until October 7, 2015.
