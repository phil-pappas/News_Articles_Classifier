Stone showed off some crazy moves on board the famed RMS Queen Mary ship in the video directed by Brantley Gutierrez. Choreographed by Sia affiliate Ryan Heffington, the video was stylized for the second single off the Arcade Fire frontman's debut solo album \"Policy\". Stone embodied \"the lady in white\", who legend has it, had been haunting the ship for years. But instead of haunting, Stone made the ship more fun. Stone started off modest with her white-rimmed shades and then she went up the deck to meet the captain. As the ship rocked back and forth, she visited the dining hall and met a bunch of sailors there. The dance grew more and more outrageous as she dashed to a narrow hall and grabbed money from jazz hands. It all cumulated to one wicked moment where she played invisible piano and got herself back. \"Policy\" was released in March under Merge Records. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Required fields are marked with *", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:00:27.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
