He posted a picture of the catch on Instagram with a caption that included part of the chorus of the song: “You used to call me on my cellphone.”\n“That was for her,” he said. “That was pretty funny I thought. I always joke with my little sister. That’s my best friend.”\nThe third-year player, who leads the NFL with 726 yards receiving, knows that people really like that catch because it was so unique, but he likes other ones he’s made better.\n“Definitely not my favourite catch of all time,” he said.\nSo what is his favourite?\n“I would probably say high school, 7 on 7, I had a pretty amazing one-handed catch,” he said.\n___\nOnline:\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T21:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T06:56:02.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
