The game will be based on the classic horror film featuring the notorious killer Jason. \nScreen Rant reported that \"Friday the 13th: The Game\" started as a horror project called \"Slasher Vol. 1 Summer Camp.\" Gun Media secured the rights to the \"Friday the 13th\" license from franchise creator Sean S. Cunningham earlier in 2015. The last game based on the movie was launched in 1989 for NES, titled \"Friday the 13th\". Like Us on Facebook \nThe studio revealed that it had the license to create the game and launched a Kickstarter campaign to help gather the necessary funding. A full trailer for \"Friday the 13th: The Game\" was also released. The video featured Pamela Voorhees, discussing the famous origin tale of her son Jason's murderous ways. There were familiar shots of Camp Crystal Lake where Jason transformed into the horrific slasher. \n\"Friday the 13th: The Game\" is currently being developed for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC. It will be an asymmetrical multiplayer experience, allowing up to seven players to battle the hulking Jason. One player gets to play Jason while the rest will be terrified camp counselors who have to work together to avoid getting killed. The game objectives involve Jason having to kill every other player in gruesome ways, while the rest have to do their best to survive the night. \nThere is also a single player mode presenting environments based on the \"F13\" movies. \nScreen Rant shared that Kane Hodder will participate in the planned game. Hodder took on the role of Jason for the first time on \"Friday the 13th Part VII\" and is the only actor to have played the character more than once. He continued playing Jason until \"Jason X.\" Hodder will do all the motion capture for the digital Jason. Special effects expert Tom Savini will also be working on the game. \nThe Kickstarter campaign stated that it will be able to feature the different places from the movies if they come up with the necessary $700,000 budget. So far, there is still 30 days to run the campaign, and the game has already garnered over 4,000 backers and close to $250,000. It seems like things are headed towards the direction that Gun Media is pointing to. \n\"Friday the 13th: The Game\" is set to launch in the fall of 2016. More updates and details are expected soon.
