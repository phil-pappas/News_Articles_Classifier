For more information on attractions and events in and around Birmingham click here . \nMs Lewis said: “Fergie is an absolute dreamboat and it’s wonderful to observe her behaviour each day. This will be her first time out in the paddock today and we’re sure she’ll get plenty of attention from visitors. We’re being completely camel-led and will be letting Fergie go in and out as she pleases. I’m sure she’ll want to have a sleep at some point during the day under a heater indoors.
