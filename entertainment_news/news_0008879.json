(Richard Shotwell/Invision) \nThe email stated that Jennifer and Amy Adams would earn 7% of the film’s back-end profits, while their male co-stars – Christian Bale, Jeremy Renner and Bradley Cooper – earned 9%. And this was after her pay had already been raised from a measly 5%. \nWhen someone in the chain queried the unequal pay, Sony boss Amy Pascal admitted: “There is truth there.” But that was that. Men earned more, end of conversation. \nIn February, Amy went on stage at a Women in the World conference in San Francisco and was unapologetic about paying women less. \n“I run a business. If people want to work for less money, I’ll pay them less money. I don’t call them up and say can I give you some more?” she said. Promoted stories Sony Pictures Entertainment co-chair Amy Pascal (Jordan Strauss/Invision/PA) \nBluntly, the facts speak for themselves. Jennifer didn’t speak up and she didn’t get as much money. Surely there’s your solution, right? \nAnd it’s exactly the same point Jennifer made. \n“I failed as a negotiator because I gave up early. I didn’t want to keep fighting over millions of dollars that, frankly, due to two franchises, I don’t need. (I told you it wasn’t relatable, don’t hate me),” she wrote in her essay. \nBut there’s a whole lot more to it that needs to be addressed. JLaw said that she didn’t fight because she “didn’t want to seem ‘difficult’ or ‘spoiled’”. She said that when she spoke her opinions like a man would, with “no aggression, just blunt”, that “you would have thought I had said something offensive”. Jennifer on stage accepting an award with her American Hustle co-stars (Frank Micelotta/AP/PA) \nThe pressure to avoid coming across as demanding, to not stir the pot, to always be “adorable” as JLaw aptly put it, can be incredibly suppressing for women. \nIn Hollywood, it’s even worse. At the Cannes film festival this summer, women were, quite unbelievably, banned from red carpet events if they weren’t wearing high heels. They missed out on conversations and networking and celebrating their work just because their footwear wasn’t sexy enough. \nIt was an absurd, sexist throwback worthy of Mad Men, and part of the double standards that saw Bryce Dallas Howard spend the whole of Jurassic World fleeing dinosaurs in a pencil skirt and heels, while Chris Pratt was comfy in khakis. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard in Jurassic World (Universal Pictures) \nMeryl Streep too, doyenne of Hollywood and winner of three Academy Awards, admitted on Radio 4 that even she still experiences sexism and unequal pay in the industry. \nShe put it down to financing: movies with women in the lead role simply weren’t considered as profitable as movies with men – by people who’d obviously never seen Kill Bill, Erin Brockovich, Alien, The Blind Side, Legally Blonde, Gravity, The Queen, Million Dollar Baby, Hunger Games, Black Swan … Please, stop me. Because I could go on for a very long time. \nEmily Blunt’s bad-ass, gun-toting, problem-solving FBI agent in new film Sicario faced a similar fate. Emily Blunt in Sicario (Richard Foreman Jr. SMPSP) \nFilm-makers were under pressure to change her role to a man. A financier reportedly offered them their full budget up front if the film had two male leads. But with a woman? No, thank you. \nThank God there was someone – the film’s male writer – to stand up and say the role was staying female. \nI’m going to let Meryl, in her inimitable wisdom, reveal my point here. Anne-Marie Duff and Carey Mulligan in Suffragette (Pathe/20th Century Fox) \nSpeaking of the Suffragette movement, Meryl told Radio 4: “For a long time it was difficult to convince the people in a position to make a decision, who were mostly male, that it was interesting to anyone. \n“Because it wasn’t seen as their fight. But increasingly we realise that women’s issues are also men’s issues and it’s our job to right the balance.” \n“It’s about everyone being open and men giving us a hand too,” she said. “I think now when men look around a room of only men they feel funny, and that is apt and correct. \n“We should all be included, we are half of the human race.” Christian Bale has remained publicly silent on Jen’s essay (Dominic Lipinski/PA) \nIt’s incredibly important for Jennifer Lawrence or Meryl Streep or Emily Blunt to raise issues of sexism, but the men of Hollywood can’t get off so slightly. \nI was genuinely shocked that, after Jennifer posed such a rational, powerful question, the co-stars she singled out in the essay, Jeremy Renner and Christian Bale, were noticeably silent on the matter. \nYou’d think, if only for their own PR, it might have been worth a quick “Right on, sister!” tweet. \nBradley Cooper, one of the highest paid actors in the world, did speak out, but admitted he hadn’t actually read the essay. Bradley and Jennifer have starred together in Silver Linings Playbook, Serena and American Hustle (Andreas Branch/AP) \nHe said: “There’s a double standard in the whole world, yeah, for sure. This is just one aspect. Anytime there’s a place where a voice can come out and be outspoken – something Sienna (Miller) did, or Jennifer – that’s great. I think it is making a difference.” \nWell, that’s great Bradley, but you’ve got one of those voices too. Use it. Don’t just leave it to the ladies. Why not start a discussion with your female co-stars to check you’re all treated equally? Why not kick up a fuss if they’re not? \nSony boss Amy Pascal said how she’d deal with the pay gap: “The truth is that what women have to do is not work for less money. They have to walk away.” Jennifer with her Hunger Games co-stars, Liam Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson (Drew Gurian/Invision/AP) \nBut how much stronger would walking away be if Jennifer and Amy Adams’ male co-stars had threatened to do so too. And I’m not saying that we poor, little women need a strong man to fight our battles, but it’s a joint effort. \nHere are the facts about Hollywood and the UK. \nIn 2013, Forbes discovered that top-paid actors that year made two and a half times more money than top-paid actresses. It means women were only making 40 cents for every dollar the highest earning men were making. \nA recent study showed that in the UK, women work on average 100 minutes “for free” every day because of pay discrepancy. \nNeither of those facts are fair. Patricia Arquette called for equal pay at this year’s Oscars (John Shearer/Invision/AP) \nIf JLaw - the international face of a beauty brand with million-dollar box-office pulling power to her name - can’t get equal pay then it seems like there’s no hope for the rest of us. \nBut by calling for a change in the way women the world over perceive their value, then her strong voice – alongside Meryl’s, Emily’s, Patricia Arquette’s, Charlize Theron’s – might just turn that trickle in to the sea-change that’s needed. Share article \nWell done, women of Hollywood. Now it’s time for the men of Hollywood to remember they have a duty to stand up and speak out too.
