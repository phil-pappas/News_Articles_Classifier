Set in 19th century America , this new book charts the experiences of two brothers who find themselves at the center of the racial politics and culture war that characterized the era. Dr. Edmund Proft and Jason Wilcox are twin brothers who are separated at birth and raised in different sides of the United States. In 1871, Edmund Proft moves to New Mexico territory from Connecticut and discovers life to be much harsher and demanding than he realized. He faces gunfights, robbery, ignorance, and most of all, prejudices, including his own. The already complex situation becomes even more volatile when Edmund meets Jason and finds that their different views and values significantly affect their relationship.\nSuffused with the pre and post-civil war zeitgeist, “ Wild River ” is a tale of brothers and the indescribable strain inflicted upon family ties during a time of great uncertainty and turmoil.\n“Wild River”\nBy Patricia Stinson\nSoftcover | 6 x 9in | 388 pages | ISBN 9781504912747\nE-Book | 388 pages | ISBN 9781504912730\nAvailable at Amazon and Barnes & Noble\nAbout the Author\nPatricia Stinson lives in Minnesota.
