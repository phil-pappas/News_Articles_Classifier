(Allure/Tom Munro) Related Links \nLos Angeles - Kate Hudson sat down with Allure magazine and finally revealed why she ended her engagement to Matt Bellamy. \nThe 36-year-old star separated from her Muse frontman fianc√© in 2014 following four years together and she's now revealed their differing opinions of their lives together is what forced them apart. \nShe explained: \"Relationships ending are painful, and you can choose to carry that or you can choose to reframe it. If Matt and I had a great relationship, we would still be together, but we chose to move on because we had different visions of how we wanted to live our lives. \n\"That doesn't mean, though, that we can't rebuild something that would be the best thing for the kids.\" A photo posted by Kate Hudson (@katehudson) on Aug 25, 2015 at 1:05am PDT \nThe Almost Famous actress - who has son Bingham, four, with Matthew, as well as Ryder, 11, from her ex-husband Chris Robinson - insisted they've stayed on good terms for the sake of their son though, having been brought up with separated parents herself. \nShe said: \"We said, 'We need to try to create something for the kids where they feel like they're gaining something rather than losing something.' \n\"It's been a seamless transition. Kids just want to see their parents be cool. Everybody's cool; everybody's good.\" A photo posted by @allure on Oct 15, 2015 at 4:35pm PDT \nKate - who is rumoured to be dating Nick Jonas, 23 - added she simply wants a \"positive\" situation for the youngsters. \nShe told the magazine: \"We create the experiences that we want to have. \n\"If you want to create the painful experience, you can do that. You have the power to make any situation a painful or a difficult one. I want to try to create experiences that will be positive for my kids. \n\"Happiness is not something that just comes to you. It's an active process.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:51:23.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
