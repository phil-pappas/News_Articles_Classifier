It was recently ranked at No. 6. \nAnd these aren’t your toddlers’ coloring books. Images range from intricate nature scenes to complicated geometric designs, most with tiny blocks to color which require real attention to detail. \nWhy the coloring craze? \nRelaxation, stress relief, therapy, just plain fun — it really depends on the “colorer.” \n“I guess I was one of those little girls who loved to color, and then I loved to color again with my children when they were small and now it’s like another season of my life and here is coloring offered again with adult pictures, therefore I don’t feel like I’m quite so much reverting back to my childhood,” said Brenda McEachern, who attends Color Me Happy, an adult coloring club that meets monthly at Grace Community United Methodist Church. “It’s very relaxing to me. You can just zone out. My husband may be watching a game on TV or something I don’t want to watch, but would like to be in the room with him and I’ll get my stuff spread out and I’ll start coloring and I can just tune out. It’s kind of like when I read — I’m an avid reader — and this is just another type of outlet.” \nIt’s not for everyone, though. \n“You have to be able to sit,” McEachern said. “I have several friends who just go, ‘Oh, my God, I couldn’t sit there for an hour.’ You know yourself. I think people have to figure out if it’s for them or not,” McEachern said. “I couldn’t get any of my close friends (to color); none of them had the least bit of interest. That sounded boring to them or they couldn’t sit still long enough. And I’m going, ‘It sounds like so much fun to me. I can’t believe y’all don’t want to do it.’” \nColor Me Happy organizer Debbie Bolton picked up on the activity for enjoyment and stress relief as she was preparing to retire as a Caddo schools speech therapist. She was intrigued after coming across information about coloring in therapy and how it can help empty your mind. \n“I loved to color as a kid,” she said. “If my mom gave me $2, I was buying colors and a coloring book. I’m not an artist. A blank piece of paper intimidates me. I have no artistic ability, but I’ve always loved pencils, papers. In our connected world, our online world, our technological world, we don’t have anything in our hand anymore. We don’t write much anymore. I didn’t realize how therapeutic that actually was and so I just started playing around with it, just some real basic things. I enjoyed it, but I knew it was doing something good for me. I could really tell it was just a brain dump.” \nNow, in addition to coloring for pure enjoyment, she breaks out her supplies when she’s feeling angsty. “For me, it just really got me to a really good emotionally neutral place and it was just a great tool and it would keep me disconnected — I would go I don’t want to look at another screen.” \nAt first, her friends teased her a bit about it, asking if she used jumbo crayons to color Donald Duck, but once she started posting her finished work on Facebook, the teasing came to an abrupt halt. Some friends wanted in, and now they’re hooked. \nAs interest grew, Bolton decided to send a blanket invitation to her Facebook friends to meet at her house to color. She expected maybe eight or 10 to reply, but the response was so enthusiastic the group outgrew a home setting before the first meeting, so Bolton arranged for the newly formed club to meet at her church, Grace Community United Methodist on Ellerbe Road. \nThat was in July. Now, there are about 30 in the group, with about 15 at a typical meeting. Ages range from early 30s to mid-70s. \n“It definitely is a social thing, but it’s just bringing your hobby. We don’t bowl and we don’t knit, don’t play cards, don’t watch football. At our house tonight, there’s football going on. I’m here. I left and said, ‘Honey, you can scream all night.’” \nAmber Dent, the youngest club participant, was a rape crisis center counselor in the Dallas area before moving back to Shreveport and now works at Grace while getting her Louisiana license. She said she has always been artsy-craftsy, but put it away for a time. Her work with rape victims changed that. \n“In my time there, I really dealt with a lot of stressful stuff, so it was very important for me. I got into sewing and picked up a bunch of my arts/crafts stuff. That was probably about four or five years ago. I’ve kind of run with stuff ever since.” \nFinding out about the coloring group allowed her to jump back into coloring, something she had enjoyed as a child. \n“I’m the one who has the chart and I want to see what the colors look like and I could never do this grab-and color-thing, but still, in my first-born perfection self, I find a lot of relaxation in it and it’s just really enjoyable.” \nShe even got a mandala tattoo for her birthday. “I was like I really like this so much that I’m like put it on me.” \nSo why participate in a stress-relieving activity within a group? \n“Because I’m an extrovert and I can relax with other people,” Dent said. “It’s also really nice. I have a 2-year-old, and as wonderful as he is and as much as I enjoy spending time with him, it’s nice to just come and be an adult and have adult conversations. I’m a big believer in self-care. That’s something that’s really important and so wherever you find that, be it in coloring or reading — I’m also in a book club — it’s really important to me to live that balanced life and we don’t live in isolation. Even though I like these things, it’s a way to connect with people too.” \nBut Dent knows it’s also a way to connect with your feelings. She frequently recommends art therapy to clients. \n“Art in general gives people a new language to express themselves. There are a lot of benefits to it that are beyond just coloring. My personal perspective as a counselor is I want to help people be empowered. My job is to work myself out of a job. I don’t want to be one of those counselors who has people in therapy for years and years and years because I want to equip you or help you equip yourself with the tools to care for yourself, so if there are tools like coloring that I can point you to so that it becomes this fulfilling method of self-care later, I will.” \nSelf-care is what Lisa Housholder was looking for when she started coloring and, for her, it’s a solitary activity. \nShe was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder due to childhood abuse after treatment for a medical condition required invasive procedures that were triggering for her. \n“I taught myself to knit, which was something new, and then I decided to try this just because I had heard from so many people how relaxing it was. As I go through PTSD treatment, it gets worse before it gets better and that’s about the time I went, ‘You know, I’ve got to do something.’ I actually find it very calming and very centering.” \nAs a girl, Housholder said she enjoyed the feeling of crayon on paper, but crayons aren’t the best choice on the finely detailed adult coloring images, so she uses colored pencils and gel pens, which she especially likes. “There’s a feeling as it scrapes across the paper.” \nAnd while the coloring trend has crossed over into apps for tablets and smartphones, Housholder isn’t interested. \n“You lose that contact with the hand and the pen. It’s just like a handwritten letter. There’s something more meaningful to that than typing or texting. It’s much more personal and you actually put yourself into that. I’ve even noticed depending on what kind of day I’m having or how I’m feeling affects the colors I choose.” \nBecause Housholder finds coloring therapeutic, she doesn’t think coloring is a passing fad for her. \n“I try to live in the now and right now it’s what works for me. I definitely find it very calming and centering and, due to some physical limitations to my body currently, I can’t do what I used to do for calming and centering which was Pilates. I can see myself doing this. I can see myself sitting down with my grandchildren and doing this, but it may change,” she said. \n“I have found that I put a lot of my grief, my worries and my sorrows on this paper and, symbolically, it’s wonderful because it doesn’t make it go away, but it does make it a little better.” \nGetting started \n•Watercolor pencils. \n•Glitter pens. \nWhile an adult coloring book will likely set you back only about $10, what you choose to color with has the potential to suck up a substantial number of greenbacks. \nA big set of color pencils can cost as much as several hundred dollars, said Debbie Bolton, organizer of Color Me Happy, an adult coloring club. \n“It’s not a cheap habit if you like the higher-end things, but you can do it very inexpensively,” she said. \nLow-end supplies — great for beginners who are testing their interest — could include generic markers, pencils and crayons. High-end brands, such as Prismacolor pencils and Copic markers, can cost as much as $7 or $8 each, although they are less expensive in sets. \nThat’s why Bolton and her friends are always on the lookout for coupons and have begun asking for gift cards to art supply stores or Amazon for birthdays and Christmas. \n“We all laugh about we used to want cute sandals and now we want colors,” she said.
