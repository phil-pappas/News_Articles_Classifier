Johnson posted photos on Instagram that listed the weight of both babies as 1 pound, 7 ounces. They were born a few months premature. \n“I have No Worries because these babies are fighters just like I am!” Johnson wrote in a post on Instagram that she also put on Twitter. \nJohnson said that she was impregnated via in vitro fertilization with her egg and a donor’s sperm. She married fellow WNBA player Brittney Griner in May, and the Phoenix Mercury center filed for an annulment after Johnson announced she was pregnant. \nThe annulment was denied and they are still married according to public court documents. They are going through private mediation to mutually resolve their 28-day marriage. \nJohnson sat out this past WNBA season while pregnant. She still has a seven-game suspension to serve once she returns to the league for her domestic violence arrest.
