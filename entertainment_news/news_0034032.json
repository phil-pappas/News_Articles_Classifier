Abrams and company will deliver one of the greatest movies ever this December. \nBut that's mainly us getting way ahead of ourselves. See, we're desperate for a good \"Star Wars\" movie. Really desperate. And Monday's premiere of \"Episode VII's\" third trailer once again suggests we will in less than two months. \nWe've bought the hype. It's over. We're hooked. Some of us even already bought our tickets . But what if we're wrong again? What if it isn't the movie every last kernel has led us to believe it will be? Are we in for an even bigger disappointment than all three prequels? \nLet me, a natural born sucker when it comes to \"Star Wars\" hype, explain why it won't happen again, strictly based on the imagery we've seen in the first three trailers. \nIn the first, all we needed was that spinning shot of the Millennium Falcon flying from a few screaming Tie fighters, buoyed by John Williams' iconic theme. We were done. Abrams killed it. \"Star Wars\" was back. \nThen the second, which premiered at the special \"Star Wars\" event in April walloped fans unconscious, this time punctuated by a shot of Han Solo and Chewbacca aboard the very same Millennium Falcon. Wake us up when it's Dec. 18 please. \nBut more important than what the snarks will label the \"fan service\" stuff is the obvious improvement in purely visual storytelling. Take the opening shot of the crashed Star Destroyer on the desert planet. As many noted that day and ever since, that single shot told a finer story than three movies could from 1999 until 2005. That trailer is littered with similar carefully conceived shots that tell us this movie has a serious chip on its shoulder. \nThat brings us to Monday night's premiere, which went a little further with divulging that overall visual design of \"The Force Awakens.\" Abrams and his cinematographer Dan Mindel, who shot each of Abrams' \"Star Trek\" movies, seem to squeeze every last drop of each shot we see in these trailers, which some deride as mere \"sizzle reels\" uncomfortable with sharing much about the film's actual story at all. \nWhile that's a fair point, it doesn't bother me. The visuals have done the trick so far, and it's clearly by design that we don't know anything about the characters, their objectives or anything else, otherwise Abrams would have told us by now. Ever the secretive showman, Abrams obviously respects his massive audience and has, so far, done everything within his power to keep it all under wraps. And no, that doesn't follow the trends you see with most awful movie trailers today that harass you with details and plot giveaways. Be thankful. \nIn the gallery above, we take a look at 25 gorgeously composed shots that merely suggest something special will come this winter. Without spoiling the story for ourselves by reading up on any accompanying plot information you might find online, we look a little closer at each image simply to speculate a little on what we might expect when we finally see the movie. More so, we just want to marvel at the design of it all. \nIt might stink. Anything might. And it has stunk, after all, despite our loaded expectations. Call us blindly optimistic. Call us suckers. We know it's dangerous to expect anything at all. But this just feels different. Just look at it. \n\"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" opens in theaters everywhere Friday, Dec. 18, 2015.
