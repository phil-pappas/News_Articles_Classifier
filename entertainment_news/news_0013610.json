The Cubs never would say that but you can.\nEverything in October keeps coming up Cubs.\nWith due respect to the terrific Mets team they will oppose in the NLCS, the Cubs should have wanted no part of the Dodgers. The Mets boast superior starting pitching depth but Clayton Kershaw and Zach Greinke possess the ability to take over a postseason a la Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling did for the Diamondbacks in 2001. Kershaw and Greinke were the most dangerous NL pitchers this season not named Arrieta. Now, they have gone home for the offseason.\nWhich increases the Cubs' chances of going to the World Series for the first time in 70 years.\nSammy Sosa hopes to throw out first pitch at a Cubs World Series game Paul Sullivan Sammy Sosa endorsed Manny Ramirez’s idea that Sosa should be asked to throw out a first pitch in the World Series if the Cubs make it that far.\nBefore Game 4 of the NLDS on Tuesday, I asked Ramirez, now a Cubs’ hitting consultant, if he thought Sosa would return to Wrigley Field one day.\n“Why not?”...\nSammy Sosa endorsed Manny Ramirez’s idea that Sosa should be asked to throw out a first pitch in the World Series if the Cubs make it that far.\nBefore Game 4 of the NLDS on Tuesday, I asked Ramirez, now a Cubs’ hitting consultant, if he thought Sosa would return to Wrigley Field one day.\n“Why not?”...\n(Paul Sullivan) The Mets returned to New York early Friday morning after making a cross-country flight and having burned their top two pitchers in Game 5. The Cubs just enjoyed two days off, a physical and mental break manager Joe Maddon believes refreshed his team.\nThey will get Matt Harvey in Game 1 and, unless Harvey is running late, he will pose a formidable threat. But so did aces Gerrit Cole of the Pirates and John Lackey of the Cardinals. The Cubs arrive at Citi Field with the hottest batting order among the final four teams.\nForget the Cubs' 7-0 record against the Mets in the regular season. That was before the Mets changed their season with trade-deadline deals. But that also was before Kyle Schwarber had become a Cubs' folk hero.\nThe Mets have young flamethrowers Jacob deGrom, Noah Syndergaard and Harvey. The Cubs counter with big hitters Anthony Rizzo, Kris Bryant and Schwarber. And Javier Baez. And Jorge Soler. Lest anybody forget Starlin Castro or Dexter Fowler. Yikes.\nUnlike many postseasons,this one looks like it could be the year of the bat.\nIt already is starting to feel like the year of the Cub.\nDhaugh@tribpub.com\nTwitter @DavidHaugh\nPrivacy Policy Chicago Cubs New York Mets Los Angeles Dodgers National League Championship Series David Ross Clayton Kershaw World Series", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5620fa9d/turbine/ct-sammy-sosa-cubs-world-series-20151015", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5620fb9c/turbine/ct-cubs-mets-dodgers-nlcs-haugh-20151016"], "published": "2015-10-16T16:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:00:54.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
