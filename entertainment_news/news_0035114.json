However, Gavin will actually have the kids for a majority of the time, due to Stefani's touring schedule. \nThe estranged couple didn't have a prenup, but Rossdale has reportedly agreed to take far less than the 50 percent he's entitled to under California law, presumably to reach a quick settlement, TMZ notes. \nThe Voice coach Stefani filed for divorce from the Bush frontman this past August after 13 years of marriage. According to TMZ, the divorce should be finalized by the end of the year. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
