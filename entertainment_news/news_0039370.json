Woodlawn preps to rock the house with ‘American Idiot’ 1 / 5 Back to Gallery Meghan McCarthy spends at least some part of rehearsals for “American Idiot” fighting her instincts.\n“Any time we did choreography, (choreographer Carla Sankey would) be like, ‘That’s too pretty; make it ugly,’” said McCarthy, who plays a young woman dealing with an unexpected pregnancy in the Woodlawn Theatre production.\n“It’s weird having to retrain yourself to do all of these things you were taught never, ever to do — ‘Please don’t ever do that’ in every other musical, and in this, it’s, ‘Yes, do that, please be ugly.’ That’s been an adjustment.”\nMore Information ‘American Idiot’\nWhen: Opens today. 7:30 p.m. Fridays-Saturdays and 3 p.m. Sundays through Nov. 1.\nWhere: Woodlawn Theatre, 1920 Fredericksburg Road.\nTickets: $17-$26, call 210-267-8388 or go to woodlawntheatre.org .\nSean Hagdorn , who plays one of the lead roles, said that director Kurt Wehner “told us, ‘Don’t worry about choreography. If it’s a little messy, that’s the way I want it. It’s rock ’n’ roll.’”\nThe Woodlawn is the first San Antonio theater to tackle the stage adaptation of Green Day’s 2004 concept album exploring the disillusionment of the generation that came of age after 9/11. It follows three 20-something friends (played by Hagdorn, Matt Lieber and Isidro Medina ) as they struggle to find their place in a country that no longer offers the promise that previous generations counted on.\nThe music means a lot to McCarthy, who fell for the band when she was in middle school. She saw the Broadway production of “American Idiot,” and jumped at the chance to audition for the Woodlawn show.\n“I love all this music,” she said. “I hadn’t heard it since middle school, but I know every word.”\nThe show marks the directorial debut of Wehner, the theater’s executive and technical director. Wehner has appeared in a few shows but mostly focuses his energies on tech and set design and construction. He offered to take on this new challenge to allow Artistic Director Gregory Hinojosa to focus exclusively on “The Rocky Horror Show,” which will play Oct. 15-31 in the late-night slot.\n“I know (‘American Idiot’) fairly well, so I thought, it’s not going to be a big deal (directing), but man, now that I’m technical directing, doing all the construction on the set and set designing and then directing and producing the whole show, it’s a lot,” said Wehner. “But it’s been fun.”\nWehner may be a novice director, but he knows Green Day. He even had some encounters with the band when he was in college at Texas A&M. At the time, he worked as a manager and bartender at the Stafford Opera House , a small live-music venue in Bryan that the band frequently played in the early ‘90s.\n“They always sold out,” he said. “It was two years later that they released ‘Dookie’ (their 1994 major-label debut) and went multiplatinum.”\nWehner recruited Jaime Ramirez to serve as music director and head the small band that will play the score. They’ll be onstage and will interact with the actors.\nIn other productions, the three lead actors play guitar as part of the band. That won’t be happening here. “I couldn’t find anybody who has lead qualities who can also play the guitar solidly,” said Wehner.\nAnd so the lead actors have been perfecting their air-guitar chops, though they’ve also picked up a few skills as they work on that.\n“It’s been impressive to see these people who at first (said) ‘I can’t play at all,’ to hearing them play songs,” said McCarthy. “That’s been really cool.”\ndlmartin@express-news.net\nTwitter: @DeborahMartinEN", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/24/8721689/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/24/8721687/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/24/8721688/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/24/8721687/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/24/8721690/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/24/8721686/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://woodlawntheatre.org/", "http://www.woodlawntheatre.org/", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/24/8721690/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/24/8721689/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/24/8721688/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/24/8721686/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-01T14:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T17:25:53.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
