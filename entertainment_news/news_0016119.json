Program information and trailer can be found here .\nInternational authority on the science and technology of cyber security, control systems and system security Joseph M. Weiss , ACS LLC will present a powerful tutorial at EnergyTech2015 in Cleveland on the cyber threat factors confronting industrial infrastructure control systems.\nThe 1/2 day tutorial is titled: \"Industrial Control Systems Security – What's Happening and What Needs to be done?\" This session will provide an understanding of ICS cyber security, how it is different than IT, recent incidents, and what is being done to address these problems. Excerpt: \" Attackers that want to cause significant long-term damage will exploit control system and facility design weaknesses and the lack of forensics, as there is almost no mitigation or forensics for attacks such as Stuxnet, that exploit the design features of the controllers, or Aurora, that exploits a gap in protection of the electric grid affecting every electric substation.\"\nMr. Weiss has provided oral and written testimony to three House subcommittees, one Senate Committee, and a formal statement for the record to another House Committee. He has published over 80 papers on instrumentation, controls, and diagnostics including a chapter on cyber security for Electric Power Substations Engineering, the book \"Protecting Industrial Control Systems from Electronic Threats,\" and a chapter in Securing Water and Wastewater Systems. Joe Weiss also writes a CONTROL Blogsite on issues of cybersecurity. http://www.controlglobal.com/blogs/unfettered/\nNow in its 5th year, EnergyTech 2015, sponsored by NASA, IEEE, and INCOSE, seeks the convergence of the best minds in policy, systems engineering and applied technology. This year's theme, \"Securing our Energy Future\", in addition to a strong systems and technology focus, explores big topics and broad policy issues concerning data, power, and energy infrastructure vulnerability. November 30 – December 2 , 2015\nEnergyTech2015 REGISTRATION IS OPEN : Early registration discounts end by October 31, 2015 www.energytech2015.com\nFor Professional Engineers seeking CPD units, 3 CPD credits are available for each tutorial session.
