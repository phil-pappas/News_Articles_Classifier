Families and visitors from throughout Westchester County enjoyed a day of live music, crafts and food alongside amateur and professional artists painting Ossining’s Main and Spring Street sidewalks with chalk pastel.\nSponsored by the Village of Ossining through its Downtown Events Committee, Chalk It Up! featured artists, both student and professional, from Westchester and the surrounding region. Festival attendees were also invited to join in and create their own art with chalk, supplied by the Committee, while enjoying live music from Mike & Miriam Risko, Adam Love, Nancy Carmichael and Martin Aronchick.\nFirst, second, and third place prizes were awarded from Chalk It Up! vendor and artist fees. Local artist Shirley Benavides received a cash award for first place. Second place went to artists Julian Negron and Alex Quishpi. Ossining High School students Kabi Boukari, Jaiyee Webb and Ana Casteneda tied for third place with fellow classmates Mae Jiminez and Jen Mielke.\n“Chalk It Up was a glorious way to spend a fall Sunday in Ossining,” said Village of Ossining Mayor Victoria Gearity. “Market Square was filled with talented musicians, local artisans selling crafts, and chalk artists of all ages. The Downtown Events Committee did a wonderful job organizing this event that drew together artists, shoppers and families to celebrate Ossining through creativity.”\nEstablished by the Village to promote the downtown area as a lively, safe and vibrant community, the Ossining Downtown Events Committee is charged with developing a variety of special events and activities at Ossining’s Market Square. The Committee is also a result of a joint partnership study with the Business Council of Westchester, which focused on how to attract young professionals to the historic village. Among the study's key findings was the desire for additional high quality programming for local residents and visitors to enjoy.\nThe Ossining Downtown Events Committee, comprised of local residents and business owners, includes Harry L. Campbell, President, Biofeedback Resources International Corp.; Bradley Morrison, Director of Cultural Arts at the Ossining School District; Miriam Risko, co-owner of Mike Risko Music School and Store; Kendra V. Rossney, owner and founder of Dragonfly Wellness Yoga Studio; Frankie Rowland, Director - Marketing & Community Relations, Down to Earth Farmer’s Markets; and Neil Woolf, owner of Bobs Army and Navy.
