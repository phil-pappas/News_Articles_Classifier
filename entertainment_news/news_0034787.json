Concussion  will be released in theaters December 25, 2015 . \"So Long\" will be available on all digital sales platforms including Spotify, iTunes and Amazon on November 20.  The song's music is by Leon Bridges and Joshua Block , Austin Jenkins , and Chris Vivion of Niles City Sound, with lyrics by Leon Bridges .  The track was produced by Niles City Sound.\nBridges has posted a fifteen second preview of the song to his Instagram page, @leonbridgesofficial.\nBridges' debut album, \"Coming Home,\" launched this summer to rave reviews and public acclaim, reaching the top ten in the US, UK and Australia.  A rare talent who performs smoldering ballads and elemental rock 'n' roll with equal aplomb, the minor-key, blue hues of Bridges' songs embrace a refreshing subtlety that feels straight out of classic soul and R&B.  A little more than a year ago, a chance meeting in Fort Worth led to an independent recording session, and soon, signing with Columbia Records.  \nCommenting on the announcement, Peter Landesman , the film's writer/director, said, \"I'm so glad to have Leon's music in the movie.  His songs are a shot straight from the heart, full of feeling and emotion, power and heartbreak.  And it's a perfect match for the movie, because I could describe Dr. Bennet Omalu the same way â€“ in the movie, he's a spiritual person, standing up on his own against a world of powerful forces, using only his smarts, his courage, and the knowledge that he's right.  Leon's soulful sound and expressive words are a tremendous addition to the film.\"\nWill Smith stars in  Concussion , a dramatic thriller based on the incredible true David vs. Goliath story of American immigrant Dr. Bennet Omalu , the brilliant forensic neuropathologist who made the first discovery of CTE, a football-related brain trauma, in a pro player and fought for the truth to be known.  Omalu's emotional quest puts him at dangerous odds with one of the most powerful institutions in the world.  The film, a Columbia Pictures presentation in association with LStar Capital and Village Roadshow Pictures, is written and directed by Peter Landesman , based on the GQ article \"Game Brain\" by Jeanne Marie Laskas , produced by Ridley Scott , Giannina Scott , David Wolthoff , Larry Shuman , and Elizabeth Cantillon , and executive produced by Michael Schaefer , David Crockett , Ben Waisbren , Bruce Berman , and Greg Basser .\nAbout Sony Pictures Entertainment\nSony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) is a subsidiary of Sony Entertainment Inc., a subsidiary of Tokyo -based Sony Corporation.
