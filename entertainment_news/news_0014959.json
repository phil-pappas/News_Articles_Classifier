(Cal Aurand) \nIn the meantime, loyal Directioners were treated to images that show the boys performing on a roof, Harry balancing precariously on a window sill, and Niall strumming his guitar while wearing cute socks. (Cal Aurand) \nThe four-piece, whose new album Made In The A.M. is due out on November 13, have also confirmed their status as one of the biggest – and most lucrative – groups in the world, as it was revealed they earned £6.15 million a month in 2014. \nTheir company, 1d Media Limited, achieved a turnover of £73.7 million last year according to their annual financial statement. That is £6.15 million a month or £202,014 a day. \nThey did have to pay more than £28 million in administrative expenses – hiring all those guards to keep them safe from the legion of fans doesn’t come cheap – meaning the lads will have to make do with £45.3 million profit before tax, or £35 million after tax. (Cal Aurand) \nRemarkably, that is almost 10 times the amount they brought in during 2013 (£4.8 million). \nWhile Zayn Malik left the group he will still be entitled to a chunk of this cash, having only left the band in March last year. \nTalking to Good Morning Britain recently, Louis said they are “counting down the shows” as they approach the final “emotional” concert of their current tour – and joked that they may take up a hobby like pottery during their time out from the band. (Cal Aurand) \nThe band revealed in August that they are set to take a short break next year. \n1D’s fans couldn’t contain their excitement about the new single, or the album to come. but. just. imagine. how. good. perfect. live. will. sound. with. all. the beats. and. the. amazing. solos. i'm. weak. #ItsPerfectDay", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T15:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:33:42.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
