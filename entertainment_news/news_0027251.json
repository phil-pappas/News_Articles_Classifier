It said: “Already a familiar face to ITV viewers from his many years with ITN, Gordon brought much needed authority and credibility to the half hourly news bulletins. \n“He stayed with the company until 1989. Gordon wrote TV-am’s Official Celebration of the Royal Wedding in 1986, a book about the marriage of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson. He is a successful author and actor.” \nAnne Diamond, who worked with him between 1984 and 1989, said: “I am so sad yet I know he had a great life. Share article \n“If you can die having had a brilliant, bright and inspirational life then it can’t be a negative thing. I’ve often envied Gordon’s approach to life. His interests, his whims, his chutzpah, his intellect, his joie de vivre. I’m sad he’s gone but I know he had a great life and I’m glad to have known him.” Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:45:32.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
