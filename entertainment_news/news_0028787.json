During the all-new extended 90-minute episode of \"The Walking Dead,\" AMC will air the world premiere of the trailer for AMC's upcoming, highly anticipated series \"Preacher,\" as well as the television premiere of the \"Into the Badlands\" trailer. Based on the twisted and popular '90s comic book franchise of the same name, \"Preacher,\" created by Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon, is the story of Jesse Custer (Dominic Cooper) a conflicted Preacher in a small Texas town who is inhabited by a mysterious entity that allows him to develop a highly unconventional power. Jesse, his ex-girlfriend, Tulip (Ruth Negga), and an Irish vampire named Cassidy (Joseph Gilgun) embark on a journey to, literally, find God. The Sony Pictures Television and AMC Studios co-production was developed for television by Seth Rogen & Evan Goldberg (\"This Is the End,\" \"Superbad,\" \"Neighbors\") and showrunner Sam Catlin (\"Breaking Bad\"). The series is set to premiere mid-2016. \"Into the Badlands\" tells the story of a ruthless, well-trained warrior named Sunny (Daniel Wu) and a young boy named M.K. (Aramis Knight) who embark on a spiritual journey across a dangerous land. From AMC Studios, the six-part series is created by executive producers/showrunners/writers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar (\"Shanghai Noon,\" \"Smallville\"), and executive produced by Oscar(R)-nominated producers Stacey Sher and Michael Shamberg (\"Pulp Fiction,\" \"Contagion\"), director David Dobkin (\"Wedding Crashers,\" \"Shanghai Nights\"), fight director Stephen Fung (\"Tai Chi Zero\") and Daniel Wu (\"Tai Chi Zero\").
