I think the biggest d**k in this situation is the dad who abandoned his son (sic).'' \nWhile Justin was initially very unhappy and felt violated by the images, a source told gossip website TMZ that he cooled off after they went viral because he thinks they are very flattering. \nThe Canadian heartthrob's personal-trainer Patrick Nilsson previously claimed he was ''well-endowed'' despite claims his Calvin Klein underwear campaign had been photoshopped to give him a bigger package. \nSpeaking last year, he said: ''I can definitely confirm that he is a well-endowed guy. I sound weird saying that, but yes.'' Contactmusic", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T21:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T22:09:05.221+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
