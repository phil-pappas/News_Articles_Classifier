The 24-year-old Australian hopeful sailed through the Six Chair Challenge and into mentor Nick Grimshaw's Boys Category for Judges' Houses, along with Ben Clark, Che Chesterman, Josh Daniel, Simon Lynch and Tom Bleasby. © ITV / Thames/Syco/Fremantle MediaSeann Miley Moore at X Factor Six Chair Challenge But there was a spot of controversy and drama when fellow contestant Mason Noise complained about his lack of airtime and received a dressing down from Simon Cowell. Speaking to Digital Spy about what he thought of the act and his behaviour, Moore recalled: \"Well, you can see from my reaction I didn't know where to look, I didn't know what was going on. He was so talented, he really had something going on.\"When I saw him on stage I was like, 'Yeah, you own it', but it made me feel better because, you know, I thought it was really good, so the fact that he left, I was like, 'OK, phew! That's another one I don't have to compete against.'\"I didn't expect him to turn like that. For that to happen I was like, 'Damn, what are you doing?!'\" © ITV / Thames/Syco/Fremantle MediaMason Noise at X Factor Six Chair Challenge Describing the Six Chair Challenge as \"brutal\" and revealing he felt a bit like a \"piece of meat\", the aspiring singer continued: \"I didn't know what I was getting myself into. I'd never seen the Six Chair Challenge before - the only X Factor experience I've had is on YouTube back home in Australia. \"Watching it back yesterday, I didn't realise how brutal it was. It was kind of like you were a piece of meat with lions all around you wanting to take a bite. \"But with that said, I think it worked in my favour because I didn't know what I was getting myself into - I just did what I had to do to get that chair. I was just so into it, like fist-pumping at the end of my song. This is what I want, this is why I came all the way to London.\" © ITV / Thames/Syco/Fremantle MediaNick Grimshaw and his Top 6 Boys Moore also came to the capital because his father is originally from Hammersmith, West London, so he's currently \"discovering his heritage\" and spending time with his family.Discussing Miley Cyrus's \"pansexuality\", Orange Is the New Black's Ruby Rose identifying as \"gender fluid\", and the \"new normal\" of not being labelled, he added: \"I think it's great. In today's world, we shouldn't be labelling and polarising - are you gay, straight, man, woman? There's a whole world in-between, let us be. \"I've got such amazing friends and family - we're just doing our thing and just having fun, being ourselves without any labels. \"The only label should be the Versace on the back of your jacket! It's fabulous, it's the new normal.\" © ITV / Thames/Syco/Fremantle MediaTom Bleasby at The X Factor Six Chair Challenge Last night's show also saw Tom Bleasby being swapped with Ben Clark, until the crowd start chanting, 'Bring him back!' and Grimshaw relented, and instead gave Clark the seat of shaky 16-year-old Nathaniel Landskroner. Moore continued: \"I think it's all about experience and knowing. Nathaniel's only 16 and he has the whole world in front of him - there's always next year. \"I mean, you see the level of talent, so you need to be on your game. You have to sing your heart out and know which artist you are.\"There's more time. But good on Tom, he's fab. He was on Ellen last week, lucky boy, living the dream, singing with Jessie J.\" © ITV / Thames/Syco/Fremantle Media On Grimshaw as a mentor, he added: \"He's amazing. I've been listening to his BBC Radio 1 Breakfast Show this morning. It's all about song choice, and he's on the radio so he knows what's now and current. He's cool. \"I'm really excited to collaborate because the crown will look really good with my outfit... I flew all the way over from Australia to get it!\"The X Factor continues this weekend on ITV.
