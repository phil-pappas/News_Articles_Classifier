I wasn't trying to do anything wrong.\" \nFollowing the advice of his lawyer James J. Leonard Jr., Giudice sought advice from members of his community who have also spent time behind bars to help him mentally prepare for his upcoming prison sentence. \nOne former inmate, an Italian restaurateur who served seven years in prison, told Giudice that he needed to remember to focus on the life he wants after his release. \"From the minute you go in, you gotta worry about what you're going to do when you get out of jail,\" the restaurateur said. \nGiudice admitted that he is worried about being away from his family and missing out on things while he serves his time, but he said he is ready to put this ordeal behind him. \"I'm ready to get it over with and that's it, and move on with my life,\" Giudice added. \nGiudice will head to prison following the release of his wife, Teresa Giudice, who is currently serving a 15-month prison sentence for the same crime. She's set to be released in December. \nThe next episode of Real Housewives of New Jersey: Teresa Checks In airs Sunday night at 8 p.m. Eastern. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
