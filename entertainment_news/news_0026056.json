AFP \nJim Carrey is heading to Ireland for his ex-girlfriend Cathriona White’s funeral following her suicide. \nAccording to TMZ , the funeral will be taking place tomorrow (October 10, 2015) at her hometown of Cappawhite in Ireland. \nThe site adds that White \"will be laid to rest next to her father\" who passed away in 2012. \nAs previously reported by TMZ, Carrey is taking care of everything financially as he paid for White’s family’s plane trip from Ireland to Los Angeles so that they could \"collect her body\". \nHe even paid for their \"hotel stay\" and offered to fork out cash for the funeral, TMZ previously reported. \nWhite killed herself last week after taking pills prescribed to Carrey’s alias, with previous reports by TMZ adding that her death was a few days after Carrey had broken up with her. \nThe site also added that White died on the \"third anniversary of her father's death\". \nIt has now been reported by TMZ that White \"had been married to another man\", and during her time together with Carrey, she was \"never divorced\".
