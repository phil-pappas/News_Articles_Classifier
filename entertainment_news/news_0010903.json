The chic set is taking back the holiday, and in Boston that means leather masks from December Thieves.\nOwner Lana Barakat found them in California and now has them made for her two retail outposts.\n“I love them because on a practical level they are made out of leather and they mold to your face and are extremely comfortable to wear. They also serve as beautiful decor items when not being worn. A great alternative to a cheap costume-store mask. “\nBarakat’s sales team has the lowdown on how to wear and pair the masks for fashionable Halloween.\n“Our unicorn mask is so special on its own, but for a more elegant look or to wear to a gala or masked ball, wear it with a ’70s inspired long, flowy print dress with a tiny metallic hue,” said sales associate Katie Barranger. “The masks also make for fun group costumes! Go with your beau as a cat and mouse or with two friends as three blind mice.\n“Pair a bunny mask with a vest and carry a cool vintage tea cup for a fun take on an Alice in Wonderland-inspired costume,” Barakat suggested. “The bunny would also look amazing on a guy or girl, paired with a tuxedo.”\nDecember Thieves store manager Jemesii Delande added, “The unicorn in silver would look so cool worn with all grey clothing — as a narwhal.\n“The raven mask can be worn with a slinky gown for a warrior goddess or with a big velvet cape for an Edgar Allen Poe-inspired theme.”\nFor locations, go to www.decemberthieves.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:02:59.179+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
