Today, the actress said starring in one of the biggest shows on TV had a profound effect on her life during her precious teenage years, and forced her into adulthood too quickly. \n\"Everything that I had known before [was] replaced by my new life: working very extensive hours, managing having a house of my own and all that goes with that, dealing with money and all the complications of having it,\" Garth told ABC News . \"I was thrown into a grown-up world that I really wasn’t equipped to handle quite yet.\" \n\"I was so young and green, I didn’t even know what a major project was or what it meant to be signing on for something like this and the possible impact it would have on my life,\" she continued. \"I don’t think you have that mental capacity to think about the possible outcome at that age, so I was just thrilled to be doing something that seemed fun.\" \nOn the other hand, Garth said she was \"'living the dream,' so how could I complain? [But] people looked at me differently, even some family members. People treated me differently. It was a head trip for sure. I honestly just didn’t know what was happening, or have any idea of changing the course.\" \nGarth, now 43, played popular teenager Kelly Taylor on Beverly Hills 90210 for its entire 10-year run. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:00:26.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
