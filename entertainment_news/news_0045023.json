TBS said Monday that the episode will air on Nov. 10. \nO'Brien said he'll be joined by his longtime assistant Sona Movsesian, who is of Armenian descent. \nSaid O'Brien: \"I think it's every boss' responsibility to take their assistant back to their ancestral land. That's why I'm going to make sure my next assistant was born in a five-star resort in Tuscany.\" Copyright   \n© 2015 Cox Media Group .
