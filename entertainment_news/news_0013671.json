Customers pick daily lineups of players in professional football, basketball, hockey and more, and they compete with other players to earn the most points and win money — in some cases more than $1 million. \nThe state's Gaming Control Board issued a notice Thursday saying the sites must stop offering their contests to Nevada residents effective immediately. Operators face felony fines and 10 years in prison. \nRegulators say the sites can apply for licenses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:45:19.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
