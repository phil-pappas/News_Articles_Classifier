We believe that awareness about prevention and early detection of breast cancer is just as important as ongoing research to support finding a cure,” said Sara Sweeney, CEO of Truth Aesthetics, maker of Trufora. “We are excited to help this important cause by donating 5% of all profits from Trufora.com in October to Bright Pink, a non-profit organization with a mission to save women’s lives from breast and ovarian cancer by empowering them to live proactively at a young age.”\nTrufora is taking the lead in raising awareness of environmental risk factors that can be associated with breast cancer. As a company whose principles are based on the importance of only containing “good ingredients,” Trufora is free from chemicals that are commonly known to disrupt hormones in the body. Trufora products not only make you feel good on the outside, but are also products that you can feel good about using.\n“We are so honored to partner with Bright Pink and help increase awareness of their organization and donate to those in need during Breast Cancer Awareness month,” said Sweeney. “As a woman and a mother to two young girls, I am truly devoted to creating products that are not harmful and made with only the best possible ingredients.”\nTrufora will be donating 5% of all profits on any purchase made on trufora.com to Bright Pink through the month of October.
