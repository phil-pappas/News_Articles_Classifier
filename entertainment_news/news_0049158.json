I mean, if your goal is to make a statement about captivity, you may as well get yourself locked up!,\" he continued.\nI just got sentenced to 30 days in LA County jail, and this is what I have to say about it: \"Considering I've become a clean and sober, dog-rescuing vegan, I must say I'm ready to go to jail-- not just because it will bring so much attention to the plight of orcas in captivity, but because it's nice to let people know I haven't lost my edge. What can I say, I'm a jackass. My whole crane-climbing, fireworks debacle really turned out to be pretty meaningful in the end, too. I mean, if your goal is to make a statement about captivity, you may as well get yourself locked up! To help give back to the City of Los Angeles, I launched a campaign today to raise money for at-risk, inner city youth, by raffling off chances to win an all-expenses-paid trip to be my red carpet, VIP guest at the taping of my Showtime comedy special next month, which is called \"Steve-O: Guilty As Charged\". There is a link to a new crazy stunt video I just made to let people enter to win in my bio.
