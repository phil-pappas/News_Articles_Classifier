Rumours of a relationship with singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran floated around for a while, but that relationship looks to have fizzled and Scherzinger seems happily resigned to her single lady status. \nWendy Williams, a host known for her up-front – some would say abrasive – style, questioned Scherzinger about the breakup with Hamilton and her feelings about losing someone “really wealthy”. Williams opined that the former Pussycat Doll wasted her “good years” in the infamous on/off relationship with Hamilton, which lasted 7 years and (as the talk how host also noted) did not end with a marriage or babies. Nicole Scherzinger attends the British Fashion Awards at London Coliseum on December 1, 2014 in London, England, with Lewis Hamilton. \nScherziner was philosophical and unflappable, even referencing the Buddha as a source of solace. The star attempted to paraphrase the spiritual leader’s words but got the audience laughing when she fudged one of the points: \n“I think as women, we…I’m still learning so much. There’s a quote by Buddha—if you’ve ever heard of him—that I like to live by and it says, ‘In the end three things matter: How much you loved, how gently you lived’—like how kind and gracious and compassionate you are—and, oh, fart, what was the last thing? It was even better. No, no, no. ‘And how gracefully you let go of the things not meant for you.'” \nIn a surprise twist, which sent Twitter and Instagram fans into a frenzy, Scherzinger also appeared in a wedding dress in an Instagram photo around the time of the insensitive interview on The Wendy Williams Show. A photo posted by Nicole Scherzinger (@nicolescherzy) on Oct 1, 2015 at 9:27pm PDT \nThe beautiful picture started a wave of speculation and solicited reactions ranging from envious to bewildered to downright contemptuous. One fan, echoing Williams’ attitude, even responded with the following: \n“You wish” \nRacing driver Hamilton’s relationship with the pop star is said to have ended because he refused to make her his wife. \nIt has since been revealed that the wedding dress picture was actually a still from Nicole Scherzinger’s appearance in a new Jamie Foxx video. One fan took to Twitter to share a clip of Nicole walking into a car in the ornate gown, followed by camera crew. \n— Nicole's Scherzies ♥ (@Scherzies_NS) October 2, 2015 \nCommentators have already noted that the former Pussycat Doll looked amazing in the gown . Her trademark deep tan and shiny brunette locks, which are currently highlighted with blonde and sandy-colored segments, offset the white gown, which flashed the singer’s ample cleavage and caught the light with its silver embroidery. A photo posted by Nicole Scherzinger (@nicolescherzy) on Oct 1, 2015 at 9:43pm PDT \nTwo million fans on Instagram flocked to “like” the picture, some speculating that Nicole was trying to show her ex “what he could have had”. \nWhile it seems that rumour will have to be put to rest, the fact that the beauty was on set with Jamie Foxx will definitely make some fangirls envious. However, the singer has admitted that she is “rubbish at dating” and appears to be in no rush to enter the dating wilderness again. \nOther high-profile men Scherzinger has been linked to include Ed Sheeran and footballer Pajtim Kasami. \nFormula One star Lewis also shared a controversial picture recently – it featured him cuddling up to a friend’s baby. The racing driver captioned it simply: “Precious”. Hamilton told media earlier this year that he is “stronger than ever” following his split with Nicole , and appears also to be enjoying the single life – he has recently been forced to deny rumours of a relationship with Barbados-born pop star Rihanna .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:30:19.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
