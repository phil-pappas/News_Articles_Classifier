And this reason is enough for her co-star GV Prakash to rag her by calling her 'senior'.\n\"I did get a few offers in Kollywood before, but this one came along after I did a commercial in Tamil. In fact, when I was shooting for Bruce Lee (her Telugu film with Ram Charan), I was told that there was to be a Tamil version of Bruce Lee too. Later, I got a call from the team and came on board. GV seemed like a quiet person, but it was him who broke the ice by calling me senior,\" laughs Kriti.\nAsk her about working with the music director-cum-actor and she says, \"GV has proved his mettle as an actor and his films Darling and Trisha Illana Nayanthara, and has been making smart career moves. Even during the photoshoot, he was at ease in front of the camera. I am looking forward to working with him.\" Talking about her role, she says, \"It is a love story and we play college students in the film. This one's a rom-com packed with a bit of action. In fact, this is the kind of a film that works well for my debut in Kollywood.\"\nThe team will primarily be shooting the film in and around Chennai. The shoot will commence shortly.", "external_links": ["http://www.speakingtree.in/topics/god/ram"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:00:09.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
