(Courtesy photo) Like Neon Las Vegas on Facebook: By Michael LyleLas   \nIt's been 20 years since the Summerlin Festival of Arts began, and its purpose to showcase artists in the community is still the same. \nBut that doesn't mean organizers can't shake things up a little, says Danielle Bisterfeldt, director of marketing for Summerlin. \n\"This year, we are doing something slightly different,\" Bisterfeldt says. \nThe Summerlin art festival returns from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday at Downtown Summerlin, 1980 Festival Plaza Drive. \nOne of the biggest changes this year is its new location. \n\"Previous years, we've had it at one of the parks,\" she says. \"I think this allows us the opportunity to do more. A new venue allows us to evolve a little and do something different. We really want to make this event unique.\" \nA nice thing about being within Downtown Summerlin, Bisterfeldt says, is people can walk through the event but also have a chance to check out the restaurants and shops within the space. \nAnd for the first time, festival organizers are offering entertainment from well-known headliners such as Clint Holmes, vocal group Human Nature, performers from the Cirque du Soleil show \"Zarkana\" and tap dancers Sean and John, who perform in \"Absinthe.\" \n\"We upped the ante on entertainment this year,\" she adds. \nBut there will be some returning performances from the Academy of Nevada Ballet Theatre competition team, Faith Conservatory of the Fine Arts theater group, the Las Vegas Institute of Advanced Mariachi Studies and the Las Vegas Philharmonic. \nGoing beyond the traditional realm of art, Bisterfeldt says, on Sunday there will be a demonstration from Metal Rebel, UNLV's robot. \n\"It's a different way of thinking about art,\" she says. \nThere will also be a can food drive to benefit HomeAid Southern Nevada. \nWhen people bring in three nonperishable food items, they will receive discount vouchers to see \"Absinthe,\" the Las Vegas Philharmonic or the Nevada Ballet Theatre. \nBisterfeldt says students from Palo Verde High School and West Career and Technical Academy will be competing to see who can collect the most food for the drive. Students will construct canned-good sculptures at the festival. \n\"Just another way to keep things creative,\" she says. \nFor those who are returning to check out the festival, there are still some things that will be familiar. \nThere will be more than 100 artists and craft vendors showcasing their work. \n\"We are trying to keep that part fresh and new,\" she says. \"About 50 percent of the people showing are local while the rest are from out of state.\" \nSome fan favorites, such as Niki Sands and Steve Appel, are returning this year. \n\"(Appel) is such a unique sculptor,\" Bisterfeldt says. \"He takes nuts and screws — things you would never think about — and turns them into art.\" \nOne thing that has remained the same is the application process for the artists who want to be a part of the festival. \n\"It's a very competitive jury process,\" she says. \nThree artists sit on the panel. Those applying to be a part must submit photos of their works, whether it is arts or crafts. Each jurist reviews the application separately and votes. \nIt is also limited to a certain number of spots depending on how much space is available. \n\"Every year, we have to decline people,\" Bisterfeldt says. \"Sometimes it's because they didn't meet criteria. Sometimes, it's just because we have limited space.\" \nThroughout the festival, there will be children's activities put on by the Discovery Children's Museum and food art carving demonstrations put on by Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts Las Vegas. \nThe event is free and open to the public. \n— Contact reporter Michael Lyle at mlyle@reviewjournal.com or 702-387-5201.
