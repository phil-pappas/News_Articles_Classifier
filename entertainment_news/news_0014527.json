But the estate has previously said in court documents Gordon fought with Brown the day she died, gave her a toxic cocktail and then placed her facedown in the tub of water in which he later claimed to have discovered her. The initial filing did not say how Gordon allegedly administered the toxic mixture. \nIn the new court papers, Brown's court-appointed conservator Bedelia Hargrove alleges that Brown died \"due to a violent altercation with Defendant after which he placed her in a bathtub, unconscious, after he injected her with a toxic mixture.\" It also claims Gordon tried to hide evidence of the fight by changing clothes. \nGordon's lawyers — among them, the man who represented acquitted child killer Casey Anthony — have previously dismissed the estate's allegations, calling the wrongful death lawsuit \"a fictitious assault against the person who loved Krissy most.\" Gordon has asked a judge to postpone the estate's lawsuit because of the potential to prejudice a criminal jury against him. \nBrown died on July 26 , nearly six months after she was found unresponsive in a bathtub by Gordon and a friend. She was 22. \nVicki Hyman may be reached at vhyman@njadvancemedia.com . Follow her on Twitter @vickihy . Find NJ.com/Entertainment on Facebook .
