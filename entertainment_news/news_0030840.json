The singer/actress joked about Kanye West and Leonardo DiCaprio and also had an \"emotional interview\" with the host, Jimmy Fallon . \"I was the only chick and the only one that wasn't old,\" Miley said as she recalled her appearance on \"SNL\" 40th anniversary event. \"Besides Kanye but I mean even Kanye's kinda old compared to me!\" She then added, \"He's about to be our future president so I shouldn't say too much.\" As Fallon said he was about to become the Vice President, Miley quipped, \"Uh, you'll have to fight me for it.\" Miley also remembered Leo in the audience during the \"SNL\" special, \"I was sitting there, and I was 20 feet, 15 feet from Leonardo DiCaprio sitting there with his mom. He was hitting a vape pen, but it wasn't him who was making me kind of nervous. I was feeling this emotion because there's an etiquacy [sic] of like, when we're there, you need to pass that sh*t, Leo. And he never did. That was weird to me.\" In another segment, Miley got dramatic when she was asked whether she preferred acting to singing. \"Jesus Christ, Jimmy, do you have to get so personal?\" she hotly replied. \"I mean, it's like, can I have anything of just my own? You're just like one of them. One of those guys out there with one of those cameras just like a leech, leeching on to everything I do.\" On top of that, the pop singer hinted at her upcoming tour with The Flaming Lips to support her surprise album \" Miley Cyrus and Her Dead Petz \". She told Fallon, \"I'm going to go on tour later this year, me and the Lips.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:28:07.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
