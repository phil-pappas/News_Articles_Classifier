If I'm even like, 'Oh, what should I wear? Or, should I do this project?' All I have to think about is my daughter and her face and I know the answer immediately. I guess she's my moral compass in a way. It's just beautiful to be an example for her.\" \nEva is currently taking a break from Hollywood to focus on raising her daughter and her clothing line, but the 'Lost River' star has only been apart from Esmeralda three times since she gave birth to her in September 2014. \nShe told the 'Today' show: \"[She's with] papa and the family. Thank god I have my entire family 10 minutes away.\" \nThe couple don't have a nanny and Ryan, 34, is happy to change his fair share of diapers. \nEva said: \"I mean, that's a given these days! I don't think that's a plus anymore. It better not be fathers out there.\" \nMeanwhile, the actress insists that, despite her success, she still loves finding second-hand bargains. \nShe said: \"I love thrift shopping. I'm a frustrated archaeologist inside so I think I let that out when I go into a Goodwill or Salvation Army.\" bang showbiz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:34:35.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
