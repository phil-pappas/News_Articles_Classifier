Related article » Tense racial relations of the 1970s and faith collide on the gridiron in the new film “Woodlawn,” which opens in theaters on Friday.\nSet in Birmingham, Ala., in 1973, the film centers around Tony Nathan, played by newcomer Caleb Castille, as a black player who joins the Woodlawn High School football team despite the objections of white teammates.\nFans of football films will be delighted to see Jon Voight (”Varsity Blues”) as legendary college coach Bear Bryant and Sean Astin (who will always be remembered for “Rudy”) as the outsider Hank, who rallies the team spiritually to accept Nathan as a teammmate. (The inspirational story is so faith-focused we're surprised it doesn’t star Kirk Cameron.)\nNic Bishop and Sherri Shepherd also star in the film directed by Andrew and Jon Erwin.\nContact the writer: features@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw8lii-b88540492z.120151014175951000gk5cjfcn.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw8lii-b88540492z.120151014175951000gk5cjfcn.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:29:07.377+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
