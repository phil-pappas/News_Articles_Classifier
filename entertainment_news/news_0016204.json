They had a prenuptial agreement. \nThe 29-year-olds married on New Year's Eve 2013 and have no children. \nCuoco's publicist has said the split was mutual and \"they ask for privacy at this time. No further statement will be issued regarding this matter.\" In this Dec. 18, 2014 file photo, Ryan Sweeting, and Kaley Cuoco arrive at the People Magazine Awards at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, Calif.
