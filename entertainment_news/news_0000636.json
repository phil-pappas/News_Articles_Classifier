The service will be free and ad-supported, they said. \nAn Android app is in the works, a spokeswoman said. \nComcast’s experiment with a video streaming service comes as the pay-TV market is struggling to retain users gravitating towards online video offerings and moving away from traditional TV content. \nComcast’s announcement comes shortly after Verizon Communications Inc launched a new ad-supported mobile video platform go90 with on-demand and live shows aimed at younger viewers. \nComcast has 30 content partners including Machinima, Awesomeness TV, Vice, Defy Media and other online video networks that are popular among millennials on the Web and Google Inc’s YouTube, it said. \nIn July, the company said it had begun beta testing a new cable TV streaming service called Stream, which will broadcast live TV from HBO and about a dozen other television networks for $15 per month. \n(Reporting by Malathi Nayak; Editing by Nick Zieminski)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T21:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:14:23.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
