This weekend’s 36th Annual Ozark Fall Farmfest promises an abundance of all things agricultural. \n“If you’ve got an urban location, two acres to 10,000 acres, there’s something here for you,” says Aaron Owen, general manager of Ozark Empire Fairgrounds. \nThe event, held at the Ozark Empire Fairgrounds and cosponsored by Farm Talk Newspaper, will feature more than 800 vendors from at least 20 states offering every possible need for home or farm, from tractors to livestock, feed and seed. Owen says there also will be representatives from banks, nutritionists and Realtors on hand. \nMore than 500 head of registered livestock will be on the grounds, and working stock dog demonstrations will be offered several times a day throughout the three-day event. \nThe Ozarks Steam Engine Association and the Southwest Missouri Early Day Gas Engine and Tractor Association also will have equipment running to demonstrate how far equipment has evolved since those early days of machine farming. \nOwen says he expects quite a crowd. “Friday and Saturday will be on par with a couple of our larger days at the fair,” he says. “We’ve got all kinds of excellent food options available. The Boot Daddy Grill is open.” \n“It’s just a wonderful family-friendly event, regardless of weather. It’s an awesome event to come to, even if you just want a lawn mower,” he says. \nWant to go? \nWhat: The 36th Annual Ozark Fall Farmfest \nWhen: 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Friday and Saturday; 9 a.m.-4 p.m. Sunday (Oct. 2, 3 and 4) \nWhere: Ozark Empire Fairgrounds, 3001 N.
