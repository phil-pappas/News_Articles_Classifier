Bondi Beach, Sydney. Until November 8. \nFor the many years that I have been coming to the annual exhibition of Sculpture by the Sea, there is one thing that always happens. As I arrive at Bondi Beach and am about to set off for my walk along the spectacular shoreline to admire the 100 or so sculptures which lie en route to Tamarama Beach, three whales appear and welcome my arrival. It was repeated again this year and I knew that we were in for a great exhibition.\nThe scenic backdrop to this exhibition is always spectacular with the most successful sculptural works being those that do not set out to compete with nature. The statistics of the show are always staggering. There are about 500 submissions from which the 107 monumental entries are selected by a curatorial panel. These are viewed by over 500,000 visitors during the short duration of the show and over $1 million worth of sculptures are sold to collectors, institutions and the public.\nHaruyuki Uchida, \"Embrace\" (2014), Sculpture by the Sea, Bondi 2015. Photo: Clyde Yee \nSpeaking in very broad terms, about 20 per cent new sculptors appear in the mix each year, so there is a gradual process of regeneration, while a number of others have exhibited at Bondi for more than 10 years. As one would expect in an exhibition of this nature, there is a mixture of popularist crowd-pleasing pieces, including the ubiquitous Chen Wenling's bronze naked figures brightly coloured red and which appear more at home in a shopping mall than on the grassy knoll, one-liner nonsense and the brilliant and challenging pieces.\nAdvertisement This year there has been a predominance of very large monumental pieces generally made from steel. These include the impressive piece by David Horton In pace , after Verrocchio's Doubting Thomas , a steel sculpture measuring almost five by three metres and creating an altar-like shrine. JÃ¶rg Plickat's Divided Planet , a broken sphere in gorgeous ochres of corten steel, measuring roughly 350 cm in diameter, is a beautiful piece with a great sense of presence. The pieces fall apart, yet possess a unity as everything is held in a tension with gravity. This sculpture was awarded the $60,000 Macquarie Group Sculpture Prize with this critic acknowledging that he was one of the judges involved. The American sculptor, Peter Lundberg, is represented by another of his huge five metre-long, cast concrete oval forms, while Dale Miles has quite a striking constructed tromp l'oeil wooden two and a half metre structure Parallel thinking space .\nThe Japanese contingent of sculptors, who always form a strong group of artists making exceptionally refined and technically polished pieces, this year are back with a polished force. Masayuki Sugiyama's The thing which has come here is a very subtle piece with steel mesh and enormously refined surfaces, while Haruyuki Uchida's Embrace , is a startling two-metre-high kinetic sculpture, where through a complex series of magnets, the different planes of the work move and flirt with gravity.\nDavid Horton, \"In pace\", Sculpture by the Sea, Bondi 2015. Photo: Clyde Yee \nThere are several sculptors from Canberra, Michael Le Grand with his tubular steel Recoil , one of his most refined and accomplished pieces to date, Philip Spelman's Middle ground , possibly not as successful as some of his other pieces, and the work by the emerging sculptor, Samantha Small, who is the recipient of the $30,000 Helen Lempriere Scholarship for an emerging artist, with her ironic, home-made tank stuck in the sand. Canberra's Stephen Harrison with his comically expressive plaster sculptures continues to make a lasting impression on Sculpture by the Sea and is certainly a unique feature in this year's exhibition.\nWhile many of the male sculptors walk heavily on the earth and make a strong mark, some of the women sculptors flow almost invisibly above the surface. Barbara Licha has an intriguing Listen time passes, with transparent wire figures floating in the sky, Bronwyn Berman's Windspiral VI: the wind is your breath and Sandra Pitkin with her Keep safe/Keepsake , each in one way or another seems to comment on the ephemerality of being.\nAlthough it may be a struggle each year to arrange the funding for Sculpture by the Sea, each year it surprises us, rewards us and assures us that the art of sculpture is exciting, vibrant and full of energy and that the whales will reappear at Bondi to herald another season of sculptural splendour.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T05:05:46.046+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
