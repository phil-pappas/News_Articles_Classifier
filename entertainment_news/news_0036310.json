Image 12 of 12 ‘The Martian’ starts strong, but is eventually blinded by science 1 / 12 Back to Gallery There are lots of good things in “The Martian,” but then there are lots of things in “The Martian” altogether. Too many things.\nThe new Ridley Scott movie is fascinating and charming and crammed and overstuffed, and it's a curious case, too. It gets all the seemingly hard things wonderfully right, but then caves in at points that should have been easy.\nWorst of all, “The Martian” turns sluggish right when it needs to speed up. By the end, the only people who still care are on screen — and they’re just acting.\nThe sluggish turn is especially odd, because “The Martian” is the farthest thing from languorous at the start. A space crew is conducting experiments on Mars, and after a minimum of obligatory comradely banter, word arrives: A storm is coming, and it’s going to be big! In this way, the story kicks in about a minute into the picture, and soon the crew is scrambling to return to the spaceship and take off back to Earth.\nThe Martian ★★½\nQuick take: A semi-fantastic voyage\nEven at this stage, there are hints something might be amiss, but they’re minor enough to ignore. The whole sequence of the astronauts fleeing the storm is Scott’s first chance to raise the audience’s pulse, but the scene is visually flat, just generic commotion and confusion with what look like 3D snowflakes (or confetti) fluttering into the foreground. The extra dimension doesn’t help, and Scott’s renowned visual sense isn’t in evidence.\nBut soon the storm lifts, and the movie settles in for a good long stretch. This is when we find that the element that sounded least promising about “The Martian” is actually the aspect that works best. An astronaut ( Matt Damon ), injured and presumed dead, is left behind. He wakes up, and the film stays with him as he gives himself medical treatment, takes stock of his food supply and tries to figure out how to survive for years until the next Mars expedition comes to town.\nAnother kind of science fiction movie would have had Damon battling space monsters; yet another kind would have him discovering intelligent life. But “The Martian” is a low-key film, in which the astronaut is the only Martian, and his struggles are simple but crucial: Growing food, devising a water supply, figuring out how to extend the life of a jeep’s battery, etc.\nIt’s surprising how interesting this can be, especially with an actor of Damon’s skill and innate appeal. All suspicion that “Martian” is going to be maudlin, a sort of “Cast Away” in a space helmet, is dispelled the first time the astronaut speaks into the space station’s video log. In these scenes, Damon is supposedly talking to himself, but he is, in effect, talking directly to the audience, and he’s so engaging, so without self-pity and so fixed on devising solutions to each problem he faces, we know right away that he’s going to be very good company.\nThe filmmakers — Scott, Damon and screenwriter Drew Godard (adapting Andy Weir ’s book) — know something important, that there is no need to treat the astronaut as a philosophical proposition or to emphasize the existential torments of loneliness on a deserted planet. The situation takes care of that part on its own. Much better to show him taking the powdered waste in the latrine and reconstituting it with water, so as to make manure for his plantings.\nSo long as the film stays with Damon, it’s fine, and when it broadens out to include NASA, it maintains its sure-footing for as long as the action is about the astronaut and his problems. But when it becomes a movie about crusty-but-caring government bureaucrats and weird-but-cuddly scientists and a merry-but-devoted space crew (led by a stern Jessica Chastain ), it becomes worse than typical. It becomes typical as rendered by an major director, which means self-important.\nBy the finish, the science discussions have become impenetrable, the musical sequences are coming fast and furious, and every bit of action that should take five minutes takes 15.\nFor the record, it’s easy to identify the precise moment that “Martian” shifts from quirky originality to bloated cliché. It’s when we get a landscape shot of the Martian red sands as the soundtrack intermingles the usual Soaring Strings of Hope with the ever popular Horns of Humane Triumph. Look out for those horns. At that point, it’s time to step out for popcorn — or just go home.\nRunning time: 134 minutes\nMPAA rating: PG-13 (sci-fi violence, profanity, brief nudity)", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/23/8721662/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/23/8721654/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/23/8721653/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/23/8721652/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/23/8721656/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/23/8721653/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/23/8721655/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/23/8721658/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/23/8721662/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/23/8721652/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/23/8721655/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/23/8721654/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/23/8721656/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/23/8721660/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/23/8721657/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/23/8721661/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/23/8721658/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/23/8721659/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/23/8721657/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/23/8721659/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/23/8721661/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/23/8721660/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-01T15:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T17:26:54.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
