But there are still storm clouds in the economic outlook. Entrenched poverty is a drag on the region, and by many accounts, there is a gap between the skills many local workers have and what employers say they need.\nFiguring out how to take advantage of the county’s economic potential while addressing its shortcomings will be an important task for the next county executive. The three candidates for the job offer distinct differences in how they might approach that part of the job.\nOn Nov. 3, voters will choose among Republican Cheryl Dinolfo, who is now county clerk; Democrat Sandra Frankel, former town supervisor in Brighton; and the Green Party’s Rajesh Barnabas.\nFrankel said she wants to focus the county’s efforts on growing jobs in optics, agriculture, high-tech manufacturing and green energy — skilled fields that pay living wages. In part, she said she also would work to improve job training and apprenticeships to help people find careers in these fields.\nOne idea among many to accomplish this: Partnering with employers to create a low-interest, forgivable loan program for Monroe Community College students who commit to work in targeted industries for at least five years.\nDinolfo said that, foremost, she wants to keep property taxes stable — a concern among business owners she's met on the campaign trail. She also wants to convene a forum of all the organizations that promote job creation in Monroe County, in hopes of better coordinating their efforts.\nOther priorities for Dinolfo: Regular forums with business owners to hear about their concerns, and traveling to national trade conferences to help promote Monroe County directly to companies looking to relocate.\nBarnabas said he is less concerned about economic growth than economic distribution and whether development is good for both poor people and the environment.\nHe has proposed a public buyout of Rochester Gas and Electric, saying that a locally owned utility can create more jobs in the Rochester area while providing cleaner power at a cheaper cost. And he wants to see growth in the \"sharing economy,\" in which people can swap goods and services.\n\"There are other ways of measuring prosperity,\" he said.\nCOMIDA\nFrankel and Dinolfo agree on a few things. Both have pledged to hold the property tax rate flat. Frankel also said she wants to set up a development advisory board that includes business leaders, as well as labor unions, while Dinolfo also spoke about emphasizing workforce development if elected.\nBoth women also said that tax incentives provided by the County of Monroe Industrial Development Agency are a necessity. But they have different ideas about how to improve the agency.\nDinolfo said she wants COMIDA to double its expectations for the number of jobs that developers will create for projects worth more than $1 million.\nAbout a quarter of projects that received COMIDA support from 2012 to 2014 promised no jobs at all; another 30 percent estimated creating one. Overall, projects in that three-year period created an estimated 3,250 jobs, retained more than 49,500 and were associated with 5,560 construction jobs.\nDinolfo said she also will ensure that recipients of tax incentives live up to their promises.\n“It goes without saying: If a company does not fulfill its obligation, then the company should not be and will not be entitled to a continued benefit,” she said last week.\nFrankel was more critical of the agency, saying that COMIDA sometimes operates in near secrecy and has given tax incentives to projects that may not have needed them — at a cost to taxpayers.\n“We need to reform how the industrial development agency does its business,\" Frankel said. \"Today, almost anybody who walks in the door can get tax abatements and exemptions.”\nCOMIDA also needs to more vigorously enforce its expectations of developers, she said.\nFrankel wants the agency to focus on developing and expanding high-skill fields. She also would like it to be involved in creating a low-interest loan program to help small manufacturers and high-tech businesses.\nBarnabas said he is concerned in general about a revolving door between business and government, and that public officials should be more of a check on big business.\nChild care for working parents\nFrankel also sought to connect economic development to child care.\nDemocrats criticized a cut this year to county funding for day care subsidies for low-income working parents in the county budget, while Republicans said a boost in state funding offset the reduction.\nFrankel said she would look to cut waste in the county budget to free up funding for child care, which would help more working parents to stay employed. She also suggested that COMIDA ask developers to contribute toward child care programs.\nIf a working single mother loses a child care subsidy, \"that puts a burden on the community,” Frankel said.\nDinolfo said she would look first to the state to make sure Monroe County is getting its fair share of funding for child care benefits.\nBut she also said it's a problem that some working parents lose their child care benefits altogether if they start to make a little more than the cutoff to qualify for assistance. Dinolfo said she wants to look at whether county funding could be restructured to provide child care subsidies on a sliding scale.\n\"We want people to work,\" she said.\nDRILEY@Gannett.com\nBuy Photo Republican candidate Cheryl DiNolfo.
