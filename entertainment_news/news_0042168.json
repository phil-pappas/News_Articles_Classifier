Or just real enough.\nThe mother and daughter duo, who were riding high as America's pop-country sweethearts the year Taylor Swift was born, only played Las Vegas as an occasional concert act over the years.\nToo bad.\nIntentional or not, their Venetian reunion has that perfect balance of \"entertainer\" and \"musician.\" When the show is over, the songs turned out to be a little less interesting than the banter, but not by much. It's a fairly close race.\nAnd here is what may be the ultimate Las Vegas compliment. Only show people may understand it, but here goes: It was hard to tell the preloaded, scripted banter from the spontaneous, off-the-cuff comments.\nWe all know mom Naomi used to get on daughter Wynonna's nerves and that Judds reunions now happen only when Wynonna agrees to it. If you for some reason didn't know this going into opening night Wednesday, you did by the end of the show.\n\"When I was 18, I would have blown a gasket over that dress,\" Wynonna declares at one point.\nWhen Naomi rises up on a lift (left over from the theater's \"Phantom\" days) flanked by two Chippendales, she asks, \"Are you satisfied I let you do that?\"\n\"(Mom)'s reached that age where crazy is kinda normal,\" she later observes.\nAnd still at another point, \"The parent role has switched. I'm now the parent.\"\nBut for how long? Not much later, 69-year-old Naomi jokingly reached out and touched her 51-year-old daughter's face during the second verse of \"Grandpa (Tell Me 'Bout the Good Old Days).\n\"I forgot the words. I'm traumatized,\" Wynonna declared, perhaps a sign that the power balance can never be permanently shifted.\nHow much of this was shtick to play right into our expectations? Hard to say, and that's the brilliance of it. What's undeniable was that by the end, it was genuinely moving when the two husbands had joined the gals to sing along to \"Love Can Build a Bridge.\"\nBy the time Wynonna proclaimed \"We did it!\" we all felt, true or not, that we'd seen something more than just another slick Vegas show.\nNaomi's husband, Larry Strickland, added only a gospel-bass backing vocal to \"Bridge.\" Wynonna's spouse, Cactus Moser, is the drummer for the whole show, but also the producer of the upcoming album that will be released as a band effort, Wynonna and The Big Noise.\nTo visually reinforce the difference, four of the six band members left the back riser and pulled up to the front of the stage for a preview of new songs, which pumped up the guitar twang and pulled even more bluesy growl out of Wynonna's still-formidable voice.\nBut the Judds catalog always balanced narrative country ballads with that swampy blues tinge, and we probably have Moser to thank as well for the cool, laid-back snap updating an old hit such as \"I Know Where I'm Going.\" Better hang on to that guy, Wy.\nThe Judds' old hits were celebrated to the point of distraction by a constant rear-screen photo bombardment of the old days: Big, big hair, mascara by the quart and armfuls of awards. Fans were often allowed to join in and supply the chorus to favorites such as \"Mama He's Crazy.\"\nNaomi's vocals were blended with another female backup singer, and she embraced her traditional role as comic foil; Lucy to Wynonna's Ricky. But the kitsch factor of a dress that looked like \"Valley of the Dolls\" gone to the prom was offset by her sincerity and obvious delight in being back onstage — or in the audience hugging fans.\nThat Big Noise album sounds like something to root for, but you also have to ask why the Judds can't come back a few weeks every year. Can't they just get along?— to paraphrase Rodney King's famous plea in 1992, the year after Naomi was sidelined by Hepatitis C.\nThat, or pretend to not get along. Either works for us.\n— Read more from Mike Weatherford at mweatherford@reviewjournal.com . Contact him at mweatherford@reviewjournal.com . \nThe most interesting Vegas...
