Because the couple were still legally married, Kardashian was responsible for decisions regarding Odom's medical care during his recent hospital stint. \nOn Oct. 13, Odom was rushed to a hospital after he was found unconscious at a Nevada brothel, where he had reportedly spent $75,000 over the course of three days. Odom had allegedly consumed drugs including crack cocaine, and herbal sexual enhancements. After three days in a coma, Odom regained consciousness and was moved to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles earlier this week. The incident is under investigation . \nKardashian, who had been dating NBA player James Harden, said earlier this week that she was putting their relationship on hold so that she could be by Odom's side during his recovery. \nOther Links From TVGuide.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:35:34.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
