There is a need for it.” \n“It’s all sad stuff but there are some funny bits along the way. It’s problems such as misogny – bad treatment of women by men, girls by boys,” he said.

Promoted stories \n“It gave the whole family a lift when he actually managed to buy them – and he got mugged and killed for them.” \nHe said: “Getting the chance to work with Danny, who I’ve worked with before, he’s fully in control and in charge even though it’s going to be a whirlwind and all over the place, he’s the guy you want in charge of something like that.” James with director Danny Boyle (Simon Annand/Dramatic Need) \nAlfie Allen, who stars in Game Of Thrones as Theon Greyjoy, described it as “an incredible opportunity”. \n“I’ve never been on stage at the Royal Court before,” he said. “Just to be on the stage here, it’s such an amazing theatre and around a fantastic cause. \nAlfie said he was so excited about his performance tonight that he left his keys in his flat. Game of Thrones star Alfie Allen (Hannah McKay/PA) \n“I got on the Tube this morning because I didn’t realise I was getting picked up,” he continued. \n“As soon as I got the call I was so excited for it. \n“The things which happen in South Africa are awful. Alfie at a red carpet event (Nina Prommer/AP) \n“My piece was adapted from the original testimony by Neil LaBute. \n“It’s a dark piece about initiation into a gang and it’s a gang-rape scene. \n“There are things that happen like that on these shores, ritualistic beatings of women to get initiated into gangs, so it’s not as far from home as you think it is.” \nAlfie said he has spent two-and-a-half weeks learning the script “like a maniac” and added: “It’s that classic thing of being so, so excited and then getting here and being terrified.” Penny Dreadful star Josh Hartnett (Simon Annand/Dramatic Need) \nJosh Hartnett, who plays Ethan Chandler in the TV series Penny Dreadful, has a long-standing involvement with the charity. \n“I’m working nearby in Dublin and was able to come by and be part of it and so I’m happy to help out in any way,” he said.
