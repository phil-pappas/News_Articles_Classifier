This is NOT WHAT NELSON MANDELA fought for.\nHUNTING brings in 2,240 million rand and yet NON HUNTING TOURISM brings in 102 BILLION rand per year ..if you continue with Trophy Hunting/ Canned Hunting/ Driven Hunting..we will make sure ALL support for South Africa in Tourism & Trade will be boycotted in favour of countries such as Botswana and Kenya that do NOT allow hunting.\nMAKE HUNTING ILLEGAL and we will support you. Keep on with making hunting legal ..and we will NOT SUPPORT YOU..the choice is yours...So why do you not as individuals get up..and fight for your rights...write about it/ teach it in schools/ talk about it...1 person may be nothing ..but it can create a wave, a wave a tidal wave ..and you can win!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T22:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:06:24.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
