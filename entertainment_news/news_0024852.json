It is just like marriage in that it is bonded by love. It is governed by the core or the ‘puso.’ Kapag nandu’n na ’yung mga elements na ’yun at talagang nag-commit ka, kinakailangan talaga na hanggang dulo mo siya gagawin. Hindi lang siya ’yung just for the moment because it’s necessary, it’s a life-long commitment,” he said.\nDingdong insists he will stick to his commitment “for better or for worse,” knowing that while “we cannot reverse climate change, we can prevent it from escalating further.”\nHe believes the key factors are “consistency” and “continuity.”\nDingdong added that the fight against climate change has now become personal for him, given his wife Marian Rivera will soon give birth to their daughter, Maria Letizia.\n“S’yempre the security of my family’s future is my top priority,” he said.\nTo further his aim, Dingdong hopes to attend the 21st Session of the Conference of the Parties (COP21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change from Nov. 30 to Dec. 11. However, he is not sure if he’ll make it to Paris, France because Marian’s pregnancy due date is on the same week.\nAs a soon-to-be dad, Dingdong shared he wants his daughter to experience the same childhood he had. “Gusto ko na-e-enjoy niya ’yung naglalaro sa kalye, ’yung gaya ng sa orihinal na kultura nating Pilipino, na threat-free. Na hindi na niya kailangan ng SPF 3000 na sunblock dahil ang sun rays ay talagang sumasagad na sa ating mga balat. Gusto ko ma-enjoy niya kumain ng mga sariwang isda, na hindi apektado ng red tide o kung anuman.”\nHe added, “Ayaw ko naman na malaman niya that amidst all the signs and the warnings ay patuloy pa rin ’yung lifestyle natin na ganito, abusado sa kung ano-anong bagay.”\nThe 35-year-old actor-TV host reiterated that climate change is everyone’s concern.\n“It cuts across cultural boundaries, religion, race, gender; it involves us all. Parang ito ’yung issue na masasabi mo na walang pwedeng ma-spare, kasi lahat tayo magiging biktima eventually.”\nThe “StarStruck” host hopes to maximize social media as the “perfect platform” to share information on his advocacy.\nPersonally, Dingdong has been making adjustments to lessen his carbon footprint. “You just have to live it. It can be as easy as bringing your own tumbler of water whenever you can, or unplugging unused electronic gadgets,” he said.\nAmong other celebrities that share his advocacy are wife Marian, Kim Atienza, Atom Araullo, Jiggy Manicad, Derrick Monasterio, Alyssa Valdez, Julie Anne San Jose, Gloc-9, Kiefer Ravena, Janine Gutierrez and Noel Cabangon.\n“Ngayon, gusto ko nang mas may meaning na ang lahat ng ginagawa ko,” Dingdong said, and he doesn’t just mean this in his everyday life but in his acting career as well. “In terms of the projects I get, hindi naman kinakailangan marami pero gusto mong may saysay o magiging makasaysayan siya for me.”\nWith the many problems affecting the world, does he still want to have more kids? “Definitely I want at least four kids. Kung ilan ang ibigay ng Panginoon. I would see them as blessings, like what our world is. It is our home, it is a blessing. We just have to work harder to take care of it like how we should work harder to protect our children.”", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:03:29.517+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
