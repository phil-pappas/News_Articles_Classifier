(AP) â€” Vermont State Police say actor Randy Quaid has been taken into custody while trying to cross from Canada into the United States. \nState Police say the \"Independence Day\" actor was detained by troopers at the Highgate Springs port of entry on Friday night, days after Canadian officials said he would be deported. Quaid is wanted in Santa Barbara, California, to face felony vandalism charges filed in 2010 after he and his wife, Evi, were found squatting in a guesthouse of a home they previously owned. \nThe pair skipped several court appearances and went to Canada, where Evi Quaid was granted citizenship. Randy Quaid's bid to gain permanent residency was denied. \nThe 65-year-old Quaid told The Associated Press earlier this week that he wanted to resolve his legal troubles in California.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:27:19.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
