Photo: David Harris \nMelbourne Festival organisers have overtaken their target of $3 million in tickets sales within the first week of the 17-day festival.\nArtistic director Josephine Ridge is not sure whether this year's bumper box office takings are a record, but says it's certainly a jump on previous years.\n\"It's an amazing amount, we're really thrilled,\" she said on Thursday. \"What we were really hoping for was that we'd get to the $3 million and we've gone past it.\nHeadlong Theatre's acclaimed production of 1984. Photo: Manual Harlan \n\"It's certainly the healthiest box office we've had in a number of years and we still have another week to go ...\nAdvertisement \"I feel like we're in a really positive place: it's the 30th anniversary and (it's) a really good place to leave the festival.\"\nWhile it was good news financially for the festival in Ridge's third and final year running the event, what was most pleasing was how strongly people were engaging with this year's program.\nToni Morrison and Peter Sellars' production Desdemona. Photo: Mark Allan \n\"We've seen that flowing over into the free events too and attendance in the Festival Hub,\" she said, with the latter holding more than 500 in the Hub music venue and another 600 in the neighbouring Spiegeltent.\nAt last count, 23 shows have sold out, including the Flight Facilities concert with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra on Saturday night, with all tickets gone within a few hours of going on sale.\nSo overwhelming was the demand organisers decided to screen the sold-out concert in full at Federation Square, where up to 5000 people could watch it on the big screen for free.\n\"That's one of the wonderful things about social media,\" Ridge said. \"You can see [the interest]. For all sorts of reasons we considered a second concert but couldn't do it. This way we're extending the audience for free.\"\nThe festival has put on additional shows for several acts, including guitar virtuoso John McLaughlin earlier this week and an earlier 5pm show for this Sunday's Patti Smith tribute concert.\n\"It's wonderful confirmation that people are really happy with the festival,\" she said.\nSome of the biggest shows of the festival are opening this weekend, including British theatre company Headlong's adaptation of George Orwell's 1984  and Desdemona , written by best-selling US author Toni Morrison.\nRidge said she had hoped to schedule extra performances of 1984 but the company was unavailable for further dates.\nShe has put her money where her mouth is in terms of securing Israeli dance company Batsheva, which is presenting two works, Decadence and Last Work,  contributing personally (along with philanthropists Jacqui and Richard Scheinberg) to the cost of bringing the act, which she has been trying to secure for the entirety of her tenure, back to Melbourne.\n\"Melbourne Festival has an approach to philanthropy, which encourages everybody on the board and both the executive director and the CEO and myself have been donors,\" Ridge said.\n\"It's something that I think if you're encouraging others to support what you do, we have to ourselves show that we are fully committed to the concept of private philanthropy and donations.\"\nThe festival runs until October 25.
