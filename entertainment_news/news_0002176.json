(Evan Agostini/Invision/AP) Tribune wire reports Contact Reporter Chris Rock might be hosting the Oscars \nChris Rock is in serious talks to host the 88th Academy Awards, Variety has learned, with an official announcement expected shortly. \nA spokesman for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences declined to comment. \nRock is no stranger to Hollywood's biggest event of the year, having previously hosted the Oscars in 2005. The veteran comedian has also worked with new Oscar co-producer Reginald Hudlin, who directed the pilot of the Rock's popular but now defunct TV series \"Everybody Hates Chris.\" \nOn Sept. 1, the Academy named Hudlin and David Hill as producers of next year's ceremony after ratings sharply fell 16% for the 2015 telecast, hosted by Neil Patrick Harris. In an interview with Variety that day, the producing duo said they had already begun discussing potential hosts, looking at the possibilities of a solo performer or a combination of people for the duties. \nHill is a longtime veteran of live TV, thanks to his years at Fox Sports and \"American Idol,\" among others. His pairing with film vet Hudlin marked a departure for the Academy, and they promised that this year's show will be similarly unexpected: Adding some new elements to freshen the broadcast, while respecting the tradition of the Oscars.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:34:11.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
