He's dead! I promise.\"\nThe last season ended with a few cliffhangers, but the most shocking storyline was Snow, played by Kit Harington, being \"killed off\".\nSnow's bloody demise was not well-received by fans, and his character's fate has been much debated.\nRecent reports suggest there have been \"sightings\" of Harington on set while they film the sixth series.\nViewers saw Williams's character Arya blinded as punishment for murdering Ser Meryn Trant.\nShare article \"In the new season my character is blind, which means I've been wearing contacts on set, which is a good laugh,\" she said.\nAs to what is in store for the rest of the cast, she said: \"I'm aware of the other storylines - we're given the full script at the beginning of each season so we can read ahead - I always flick through my story first, the suspense is too much. I have to see what I'm up to first and then what other people are up to but it's never the same as seeing on screen - it's nice to watch and get the full effect.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-02T17:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:17:26.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
