Following the season 7 premiere, a sneak peek for the second episode has been shared, teasing a brewing rivalry between Ruth Eastman (Margo Martindale) and Eli Gold ( Alan Cumming ). \"I will destroy you and everything you hold dear,\" Ruth threatens Eli, who responds with a laugh. Martindale is one of the new additions this season, playing a national political strategist who becomes Peter's ( Chris Noth ) campaign manager for his vice presidential run. Executive producers Robert and Michelle King previously gushed about the dynamic between the two, \"Every year we look for a character and an actor who can go toe-to-toe with Eli Gold and make him blink,\" adding that Margo's \"ability to mix comedy and drama is unparalleled. And we can't wait to see how Margo and Alan deal with each other.\" The video introduces another new face, Jeffrey Dean Morgan who plays Jason Crouse, a \"calm, experienced hourly investigator\" who will work for Alicia ( Julianna Margulies ) as she attempts to revive her struggling law career. Robert King once hinted at a possible romance between Alicia and Jason, saying that the chemistry between the two would be \"tactile,\" but \"the Catholic-girl part of\" Alicia would be hesitant to embrace such an extramarital affair. In \"Innocents\", Alicia argues a complex museum vandalism case that involves photographs a mother took of her son, and considers enlisting the help of investigator Jason Crouse. Also, Cary must deal with partner Howard Lyman's inappropriate conduct towards the younger associates at the offices of Lockhart, Agos & Lee. The new episode airs Sunday, October 11 after \" Madam Secretary \" on CBS. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:58:40.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
