Then tune in Sunday night at 9:00 p.m. to the Food Network's season premier of Halloween Wars. And, when you do, look out for the \" Scream Team \", that includes as a team member, Rochester's home grown boy and inventor of the world famous Mustache Bottle Opener , Adam Bierton . His randomly selected teammates include Robert Teddy (center) and Darci Rochau (right). The show will have the team competing in the \"Infestation\" competition, with five teams described by the Food Network as, \"... made up of an expert pumpkin carver, cake decorator, and sugar artist go to battle to create mind-blowing Halloween-themed displays that capture a terrifying infestation. At the end of the battle, one team will be eliminated with help from a special guest judge, actor Robin Atkin Downes from The Strain.\"\nAdam was interviewed by the Food Network and here's what he said about the his biggest fear in the competition: \"Biggest fear is time and time alone,\" he said. \"I am a perfectionist by heart and spend a lot of time on the details (of everything). So I’m trying to tune myself in to produce the highest quality results in the quickest amount of time. Otherwise I’m feeling like a pumpkin pie of emotions: confident, nervous, positive, anxious, relaxed, excited, exhausted, determined, petrified, ready, willing and able. Bon appétit!\"\nBut it isn't just for fun. There's a $50,000 first prize if he gets to the finals. You can buy a lot of bottle openers for that kind of cash!\nThe Food Network is on Time Warner Cable station 45.\nKenneth Warner Blogger: Rochester: MORE FROM OurTownsBlog City Living: The great migration Rich Gardner, blogger | 2:26 PM Oct 2, 2015 City Living: How the West was won Rich Gardner, blogger | 2:47 PM Sep 30, 2015 Who needs Farmers, anyway?
