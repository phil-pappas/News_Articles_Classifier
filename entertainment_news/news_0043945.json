Actor Vincent Price later bought it and donated it to the Honolulu Museum of Art in 1981.\nMuseum officials returned the cedar pole to seven Tlingit (KLINK'-it) tribal members who traveled from southeast Alaska for a ceremony Thursday.\nThey sang songs and thanked Hawaii for taking good care of the pole, which was packed in a crate to be shipped to Alaska.\nSociety & Culture Arts & Entertainment totem pole John Barrymore University of Alaska Anchorage Alaska", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:39:01.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
