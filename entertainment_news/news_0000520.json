Heading down to Gulf Shores, Orange Beach, or the Florida panhandle is a routine part of our summers. But with hot temperatures and growing crowds, there could be a better time to go â€“ and that time is the fall. Here's why: \nFewer people and lower prices \nThere's nothing worse than fighting for a prime spot on the beach in July and having someone set up their tent right in front of you. And waiting two hours to be seated at a restaurant is never fun, either. With school back in session, it's harder for families to get away for a week. Luckily for empty-nesters or those with a more flexible schedule, the beaches clear out significantly come September. Restaurant wait times decrease, it's easier to have your own space on the beach, and most importantly, prices drop. The prices on condos and beach rentals vary drastically between season and off-season. Just waiting even one weekend past Labor Day can save you big bucks. \nCooler temperatures \nIn July and August, the high temperatures are paired with stifling humidity and an occasional breeze. But in the mid- to late fall, the temperatures begin to decrease and the breeze picks up. In September and October, it's still warm enough to lie on the beach and go in the water, with the average temperatures at 78.6 degrees and 71.2 degrees respectively, according to gulfshores.com. In the Florida panhandle, those temperatures stay between 70 and 80 degrees in early fall, compared to temperatures in the 90s in July and August, according to destinchamber.com. \nEvents and food festivals \nAlong the Gulf Coast, there's an event happening almost every weekend in the fall. Event organizers know that no one wants to be walking around a festival in the blazing heat of summer so the events really pick up in autumn. This past weekend, September 24-26, Orange Beach held their second annual The Wharf Uncorked , which benefitted Make-A-Wish Alabama and featured fine wines and dishes from renowned chefs. Head to Gulf Shores October 8-11 for the 44 th Annual National Shrimp Festiva l, with 80 hours of live music, 50 vendors, and 200 pounds of shrimp prepared per day by area chefs. The Destin Seafood Festival is happening October 2-4 and Baytowne Wharf at Sandestin is hosting their Baytowne Wharf Beer Fest October 16-17. Decide between Alabama and Florida on the first weekend in November for the Oyster Cook-Off and Craft Beer Weekend in Gulf Shores November 6-7, or the Seeing Red Wine Festival , November 5-8, in Seaside along 30A. \nOysters \nOctober marks the beginning of oyster season in Alabama, and public oyster reefs open for commercial and recreational harvest October 1. The saying goes you shouldn't eat oysters in months that don't have an \"r\" in them, which means summer isn't the ideal time to slurp down a dozen. While that doesn't always hold true, oysters are at their best in the cooler months. Try farm-raised Murder Point Oysters with Back Forty Beer mignonette at Fisher's , fried Surfin' Oysters with roasted poblano, brie cheese, and pepper glaze at Shipp's Harbour Grill , and Parmesan Garlic fire-grilled oysters at The Original Oyster House .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T23:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T07:39:03.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
