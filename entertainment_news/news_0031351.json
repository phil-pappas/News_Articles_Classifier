Though a woman experimenting with 'masculine' clothes is hardly new, there seems to be an uprising of sorts in the arena of men's fashion too. We recently saw Alia Bhatt showing off her feisty dance moves donning a moustache and tuxedo in the Gulaabo song from Shaandaar. Before that, we had Ranveer Singh walking into media events sporting floral prints galore. hitlist takes a cue from some fashion forward Bollywood celebs who have successfully shattered stereotypes by togging up in gender-neutral clothing...\nDistress to impress \nDistressed denims are all the rage and have gotten a nod from both men and women.\n\nIn fact, Alia Bhatt channeled her quirky sense of style by opting for ripped jeans with an overcoat for a recent event. Sidharth Malhotra, too, seems to be embracing the trend.\n\nSuit bliss \nShruti Hassan gave the tux a twist of sorts and pretty much redefined rules when she walked the red carpet for an awards ceremony wearing a quintessentially male outfit.\n\nWhile we give credit to Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie for bringing back his-her suits the way they did at the BAFTA Film Awards in 2014, Athiya Shetty and Sooraj Pancholi seem to be pulling off the unisex trend with panache too.\n\nFlower ballad \nRanveer Singh gets extra points just for going big on experimentation. And though it borders on queer at times, it manages to break out of the box.\n\nIf you thought dainty, floral prints were only for the elegant female, he makes you rethink. Ranveer sported a floral print coat with lavender coloured pants with a hat and seemed to have one message for the boys: ditch the mundane.\nDenim flair \nDenim on denim is a fun trend to sport, but can be quite tricky in some ways.\n\nBoth genders are comfortably wearing it though. We love Kangana Ranaut's chic take on the look with a chambray shirt and Oxfords pairing.\n\nBandana swag \nTake a leaf from Farhan Akhtar's book and team your casual outfit with a headband. Essentially considered a female accessory, an increasing number of men can be seen playing with different styles of bandanas and headbands.\n\nWe saw Priyanka Chopra walking out of the city airport sporting this particular look.\nDesignerspeak \nI think we are slowly realising and thankfully so, that function and individuality with an edge are much more important than what’s conventionally appropriate. I think Ranveer Singh has paved the way for a metrosexual trend within the Bollywood brigade with his risqué and sexy style\n- Rocky S \nStructure is back with a bang. Most designs for both men and women are seeing sharper silhouettes and absolutely non-gender based cuts\n- Raghavendra Rathore \nThis is the future of fashion because we can finally wear what we like instead of being bound by what we are supposed to wear. In Bollywood, Alia Bhatt and Shraddha Kapoor are two icons who I have seen sporting this trend tremendously\n- Jyoti Sachdev Iyer\nI think women are carrying off men’s clothing quite effortlessly. Kangana Ranaut is a classic example of someone who can pull off a boyfriend shirt and pant-shirt with Brogues and totally own the look. Alternatively, we have Ranveer Singh who can get away with donning a floral pant suit and pull it off better than anyone else.\n- Nikhil Thampi", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:58:33.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
