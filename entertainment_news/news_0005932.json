As the tune has no words, Spaniards can at most sing \"La, la, la\" or \"chunda, chunda, chunda\" — or just hum — making for awkward moments at official ceremonies and sporting events.\nLago's lyrics begin with \"Glory, Homeland!\" and can be heard sung to the anthem's music in the proposal's website.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:53:19.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
