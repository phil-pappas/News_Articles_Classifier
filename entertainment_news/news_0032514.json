This is the Bombers' second go-around with synthetic turf. The high school was the first in Monroe County to dump natural grass for the artificial kind back in 2000. Most of the county's suburban schools (13 of the 23 in the Monroe County Public School Athletic Conference) have since followed suit. But instead of sneaker soles, they filled their fields with ground-up tires.\nThe big-ticket investments in synthetic turf have led a decadelong buildup of athletic facilities across the region. The building boom has largely come at taxpayers' expense, and has been consistently challenged on the grounds of expense, priorities and health and safety concerns.\nThe buildup underscores the growth of high school sports locally and nationally. Girls have driven a steady increase in participation every year since 1969, according to the National Federation of State High School Associations. New York has seen an overall increase of 11 percent, or 39,000 boys and girls over the past decade alone, federation records show.\n\"Youth sports has grown dramatically,\" said Rick Pound, assistant principal at Gates Chili, explaining the upgrades as a necessity. \"It's a status thing, too. … The turf field is a definite want. When you talk about versatility with phys-ed and sports, it's almost foolish not to.\"\nBuy Photo East Rochester Athletic Director, Mark Michele, walks on the new synthetic turf field at the school. (Photo: MAX SCHULTE/@maxrocphoto/, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER)\nEast Rochester's resurfacing cost $1 million, including the track that encircles the field. Aquinas Institute, another early adopter of synthetic turf, has invested $11 million in its athletics facilities over the past decade, accounting for just more than half of its capital budget during that period. Canandaigua is awaiting state sign-off on $13 million in upgrades focused on athletics, including a synthetic turf field. Churchville-Chili is proposing a turf field in its next round of construction projects. The Rochester School District has $5 million budgeted for new turf fields at Franklin and Wilson Commencement.\nNationwide, the number of synthetic fields and playground surfaces has more than tripled, from 3,500 in 2008, to 11,000 today. It is durable, low-maintenance and a consistent playing surface regardless of the weather. And it has evolved from the early days of injury-inducing carpet on concrete or the sand-filled Omniturf to synthetic \"grass\" fibers and rubber pellets or crumbs that offer a cushion, provide stability and help with drainage.\nEast Rochester chose recycled tires for the infill crumb initially, but in the resurfacing, it switched to sneakers — partly in response to the safety debate that has simmered for years with no certain answers.\nIt's a national, if not global, debate — about risk of injury, or risk of illness from playing on a sometimes super-heated surface of polyethylene and rubber (some 20,000 tires are used on a typical football field).\nDespite a multitude of studies, experts still disagree on the potential dangers or lack thereof. The New York state departments of Health and Environmental Conservation and those installing the turf, from manufacturers to school districts, say the elevated temperatures on sunny days can be mitigated and no reputable studies have otherwise demonstrated that turf is unsafe.\nThe counter-argument is that the studies have been incomplete and any conclusions are difficult to justify given the lack of exposure standards for the host of metals and chemicals, including lead and carcinogens, that are present. Critics say the greatest concern is in playgrounds, with the potential risk of exposure either through breathing, ingestion or contact with open wounds.\nStudies, including one from the State University of New York at Albany, have found it unlikely for chemicals to move into the air, water or soil in real-world conditions. And industry officials argue that you could test almost any material and find low levels of something undesirable. That does not necessarily equate to danger. Rep. Steve Israel, D-Huntington, Suffolk County, asked the Environmental Protection Agency to re-examine the issue earlier this year, saying federal officials have \"whiffle-waffled\" on the safety question. The EPA and the Consumer Product Safety Commission have conducted limited studies, with the commission coming under fire for its reliance on and relationships with industry lobbyists.\nIn East Rochester, the crumb is called Nike Grind, and promoted as a safer alternative because it comes from material meant to be worn on the body that is manufactured with more stringent standards. Nike Grind has not yet been subject to the same scrutiny as the tire crumb.\n\"People just assume (turf fields) are safe because they are everywhere,\" said Nancy Alderman, president of the nonprofit consumer watchdog group Environment and Human Health Inc., based in Connecticut. She likens turf to asbestos, tobacco and Teflon. \"These things take a very long time for people to understand. And then, once they do, they think, 'Oh, how did this happen?'\"\nBuy Photo East Rochester 's new synthetic turf field and track where Steve Breneman paints on lanes. (Photo: MAX SCHULTE/@maxrocphoto/, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER)\nBig buildups\nEach district is different. And the facilities buildup is not just turf.\nIt's workout facilities. It's gyms. It's flooring, concessions, lighting.\nPenfield, which has had artificial turf since 2008, currently is in the first half of a $2.8 million gym renovation and lighting addition, at the stadium and elsewhere. Here, as elsewhere, state aid covers roughly three-fourths of the cost.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nBright idea: Penfield to celebrate new lights\nAt Gates Chili, the field house is one of the largest facilities of its kind in the state. The addition, part of $48 million in school construction the district undertook a decade ago, could double as an airport hangar. It houses a gymnasium that seats 2,500 or accommodates six full basketball courts, an elevated four-lane track, an eight-lane swimming pool with movable bulkheads, a workout facility open to the public, individual team locker rooms, a training room.\n\"Let me get you a map,\" said Gates Chili's interim athletic director, Chris Bourne.\nOne needs a map because 20 athletic fields encircle the high school. All are natural grass — but turf is on the school's wish list.\n\"A lot of times, up here (in western New York), you are in a gym until the first game almost,\" Bourne said.\nPound, the school's assistant principal, is also a parent, whose children attend Pittsford schools, where they play lacrosse and football on synthetic turf fields. He also had a turf field installed when he was an athletic director in Skaneateles, Onondaga County. The only negative he saw was the higher on-field temperatures, and thus he put an emphasis on educating coaches about hydration and signs of heat exhaustion in players.\n\"I've never had an issue with it as a parent,\" he said, instead seeing the benefit of a level, consistent surface that is hard to find with natural grass at this level of competition, not to mention one that is cushioned to protect against concussions. \"The turf nowadays is so much safer, so much more user-friendly than the turf I played on.\"\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nGreece voters OK repairs, reject stadium\nVoters in Greece recently rejected a new stadium and turf field, however. The main goal was for a lighted stadium. \"And the turf, we just thought, 'Well, let's get turf, too,'\" said Dina Barnard, who was on the steering committee and whose three boys play sports. \"I have seen a lot of football games in the rain on grass, and it is not safe.\"\nA lighted stadium would provide a spot for the community to gather on Friday nights, she said. The argument she and others make for turf is that it allows for more games, more practice time, more access, including for marching bands and youth sports.\nHere, and elsewhere, the debate at the ballot box has been largely about the need, the scope of work, and the cost, with most of the expense paid from state tax coffers. That was the case in Canandaigua, which persisted through three failed referendums over the span of 10 years before voters agreed to help fund this and other upgrades last December. But district spokesman Andy Thomas said health and safety were issues, too.\nHe knows the concerns well, and speaks in detail about each — clearly having had this discussion before. The district sought out Syracuse-based consultant Appel Osborne, which compiled more than 400 studies on the subject to answer citizens' questions.\nAppel Osborne's website lists turf projects across central and western New York, including Victor, Caledonia-Mumford, Honeoye Falls-Lima, Our Lady of Mercy, Penn Yan and Glens Falls, but also natural grass projects at Geneva, NBT Bank Stadium in Syracuse and others.\nSome of the turf clients opted for A-Turf, a nationwide synthetic field supplier based in Williamsville, Erie County. A-Turf got its start in 2002, and does most of its business in New York. In addition to area high schools, including McQuaid Jesuit, Brighton, Spencerport and both Webster Thomas and Webster Schroeder, A-Turf can be found at Monroe Community College, St. John Fisher and the Buffalo Bills' Ralph Wilson Stadium.\n\"There is a general belief out there that all these fields are the same ... but they're really not,\" said Jim Dobmeier, president and founder of A-Turf and Surface America.\nChemical compositions of crumb rubber infill vary by supplier, and there are alternatives from cork to coconut husks. Even the tires can be previously unused or recycled. The product continues to evolve, going from a sparse weave of abrasive nylon fibers to more densely packed polyethylene, a softer, common plastic used in everything from grocery bags to shampoo bottles.\nUsing New York state soil cleanup guidelines for brownfields , University of Albany researchers and, separately, a Rochester consumer advocacy group called RAMP tested the infill supplied to a handful of local fields in 2007 and in spring 2015, respectively. Each time, they found metals and chemicals exceeding the state guidelines, most recently of cadmium, zinc and DEHP, a so-called plasticizer or softener with potential, though unproven, health effects.\nIn its report, University of Albany researchers noted that testing shows low concentrations of individual substances. But evaluations of hazardous waste sites do not typically measure each compound in isolation. Rather, the report states, one must consider the combination present as multiple chemicals can target the nervous and other bodily systems or otherwise cause harm.\nThey concluded that more study was needed.\nA greener way?\nThe United States generates 290 million scrap tires annually, according to the EPA. Of those, 28 million are repurposed for ground rubber applications, with others used as fuel, highway sound barriers or stamped into other products. The federal agency counts at least 110 products that use recycled tire rubber, with athletic and recreational applications being the fastest-growing market.\n\"It's a serious problem,\" said Alderman, whose Connecticut watchdog group is made up of lawyers and doctors. \"And if you go back to figure out how it (got started) in the very beginning, it's because the EPA sponsored it.\"\nAs for how it began here?\nEast Rochester was landlocked — with no space for additional fields to accommodate the growing number of sports teams. That was a significant reason to look at turf beginning back in 1998. Then, as now, the district studied the issue, weighing everything from cost to health and safety.\n\"There is a myth, and I'll call it a myth, that some of the black tires may have carcinogens and other toxic materials,\" said Mark Michele, the ER athletic director, having reviewed reports from both sides. \"If the fields were that dangerous, they would be ripping them out all over the place.\n\"It is inconclusive.\"\nNonetheless, in Michele's view, Nike Grind is the \"latest and greatest,\" and a means of going green. Canandaigua, meanwhile, is insisting on virgin or freshly produced rubber, rather than recycled rubber for its first synthetic turf, which should start being installed in the spring.\nBack in the city, which has seen a rapid expansion of sports offerings and participation, school district officials have put an emphasis on fields and indoor facilities over the past five years.\n\"We're pushing access and availability, trying to strengthen our youth programs,\" said Carlos Cotto, the district's executive director of health, physical education and athletics, who sees sports as the carrot to motivate kids and ultimately improve academics and the district's graduation rate.\nHe goes school by school, listing deficiencies and attributes. East lacks a weight room but has the only turf field — in such demand from youth sports programs that it was scheduled seven days a week during the summer and into this fall, at times nine hours a day.\nWilson's football team practices off Arnett Boulevard, and the rest of the outdoor sports teams head to Genesee Valley Park. The landlocked school has a newly renovated weight room and is adding equipment. The new field will go in at the grade school down Genesee Street. Franklin will have the best field when completed, as it has an eight-lane track.\nAnd there are discussions of yet another turf field (making one per quadrant) at Edgerton Park that would require reconfiguration of the sports complex there.\nThe build-out is strategic, Cotto said, getting back to his earlier position: \"My expectation is if our teams aren't on these (fields), then there should be somebody out there.\"\nDistrict officials relied on the state Health Department's determination regarding safety.\nBypassing turf\nTurf hasn't always won out in the facilities buildup.\nRush-Henrietta spent $15 million on recent improvements to its high school that largely went to athletic facilities, with a new and larger gym that seats 2,000, a redone track, a press box and outdoor concessions and bathrooms. There is a coaches meeting room, a film room and a sizable training room staffed by a full-time trainer.\nMany of the athletic playing facilities meet NCAA and even international regulations. The goal was to get the best possible, and position the school to host regional and statewide events, said R-H athletic director Tom Stewart. Those generate revenue, not directly for the school, but for the booster club, which in turn supports the athletic programs.\n\"It's not quite as large as Gates,\" he said. \"It's close.\"\nBut when it came to fixing the fields, R-H bypassed turf and chose lush Kentucky bluegrass.\n\"If you look at it from here, you think it's artificial turf,\" Stewart said, standing some distance from the field.\nHis remark is both accurate and demonstrative of just how pervasive synthetic fields have become. You also sense it when you first arrive, and take note of the seeming oddity of a sprinkler watering one field and a groundskeeper mowing another. Here, too, the choice was largely an economic one. The multi-purpose field R-H uses for football and lacrosse cost $560,000, while the turf field it was eyeing would have cost $1.5 million, and would have required renovation/resurfacing for an additional $1 million in little more than a decade.\nThe school has other fields available for practice \"so the grass field does not take a constant beating,\" district spokesman Travis Anderson said in an email.\nAnderson was unable to break out maintenance costs. The field is constructed to drain rapidly, such that it is \"bone dry\" after a hard rain, Stewart said. The Royal Comets are in the midst of their third football season on the new field, he said, and have played in the pouring rain without leaving a single divot. The resilience is \"spectacular,\" he said. But the first reason Stewart lists for skipping turf is something else entirely.\n\"Health and safety was a question,\" he said.\nU.S. soccer star and Pittsford native Abby Wambach was outspoken on her objections to playing on turf during the recent World Cup. It changes the game, she said, and causes players to think twice about footing and sliding.\nFOR THE WIN\nAbby Wambach: USWNT would have more goals if World Cup played on grass, not turf\nAgain, however, the multitude of variables between synthetic surfaces, both from the generational changes and from present-day product differences, make drawing any scientific conclusion difficult, said Dr. Michael Maloney, professor of orthopedics and chief of sports medicine with University of Rochester Medicine, noting that the last paper that came out in orthopedic literature reached no conclusion at all.\n\"One thing that is consistent, it's not so much what type of turf per se, (but) what type of shoe,\" he said, referring not to those ground up as infill but those worn by the players. \"It is almost the force between the shoeware and the actual surface. … You see that with the NFL players. They have different shoes for different conditions: rain, snow, artificial, grass.\n\"The type of shoes being worn on these surfaces probably contributed more to injuries,\" he said.\nUltimately, it comes down to an argument of whether the fields have been proven to be dangerous or not proven to be safe.\n\"There is not a standard for turf,\" said Judy Braiman, president of the Rochester-based consumer advocacy group Empire State Consumer Project, who is unabashed in her alarm: \"These kids are basically playing on hazardous waste.\"\nDobmeier insists turf is as safe and sanitary as natural grass, which can present its own challenges with fertilizers and pesticides. And there are means to clean a synthetic playing surface. The Rochester Rhinos have a machine (a team spokesman calls it a $15,000 Rug Doctor) that it uses at Sahlen's Stadium and has lent to Aquinas and Brighton to scrub the fields and redistribute the crumb.\n\"As a parent, as a taxpayer, as an athlete — as a former athlete — it is very important to understand the utility, the functionality of these fields,\" he said, explaining that high schools and small colleges with limited land can put in a single field that can be used 500 times a year for 10 years or more. \"You start doing all of that and saying, 'Wow, is there a natural grass system in the world that could do that?' No, there isn't.\n\"Mother Nature is awesome. But you know what? It's not durable enough for today's world.\"\nBDSHARP@Gannett.com\nBy the numbers\n290 million : Number of scrap tires generated annually in the United States, according to the EPA.\n28 million : Scrap tires repurposed nationally for ground rubber applications.\n20 million : The top-range estimate of the number of scrap tires generated annually in New York, equating to one tire per person, per year, according to the state Department of Environmental Conservation.\n20,000 : Number of tires needed, on average, to provide the crumb infill for one synthetic turf field, according to A-Turf.\n110 : Products that use recycled tire rubber, according to the EPA, with athletic and recreational applications being the fastest-growing market", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/180a1dad63f7520dcffb9d08fdd02e3f6cc738f8/c=14-0-867-480&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Rochester/2015/03/24/B9316724256Z.1_20150324224648_000_GESAAN5C9.1-0.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e0aa0126b5bb63ef84791b9a7712248ad4eff51d/r=500x310/local/-/media/2015/09/11/Rochester/Rochester/635775835142262652-turf3.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/56a7da7e5da1a18e93d8512a818a490868eb896c/c=820-0-4097-2464&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/09/11/Rochester/Rochester/635775835137114586-turf4.jpg", "http://www.aturf.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/empirestateconsumerproject", "http://www.appelosborne.com/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/11/Rochester/Rochester/635775835137114586-turf4.jpg", "http://www.ehhi.org/", "http://www.dec.ny.gov/chemical/8450.html", "http://nikegrind.com/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ffe5e759a39b02101f4d5848dd89f9b0af7322a8/r=500x234/local/-/media/2015/09/11/Rochester/Rochester/635775835137114586-turf4.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cab7517c49aaee5a3d3c7272ea212753d2f9d15a/c=463-0-4863-3308&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/09/11/Rochester/Rochester/635775835142262652-turf3.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/229a266c1d87596ea1d40221983b0d102eac4ac0/c=864-363-2123-1074&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/09/24/Rochester/Rochester/635786930278228264-ThinkstockPhotos-500392881.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ebc9519ac086054fa5092ba711393606fbfe81d3/r=300/https/i1.wp.com/usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/gty_476920426_73749500.jpg?fit=440%2C330", "http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/06/abby-wambach-uswnt-world-cup-turf-goals", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/11/Rochester/Rochester/635775835142262652-turf3.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-25T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:03:33.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
