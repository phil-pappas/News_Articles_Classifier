That's old soap opera news to all who have been watching ' The Young and the Restless ' this week. But, how would viewers feel if the great 'Victor Newman' (Eric Braeden) uses his resources to prove that 'Adam' didn't kill 'Delia' (Sophie Pollono) after all?\nPhoto by Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images View all 5 photos After modest consideration, 'Adam' contacted his dad and agreed to accept needed assistance. ' Victor's ' offer of facilitating bail, in return for 'Adam's' help in shutting down the 'Paragon Project', is real and makes sense on many levels. The 'Dark Knight's' company can still be saved and 'Adam' might be able to convince 'Chelsea' (Melissa Claire Egan) to remain in Genoa City, as long as he has time to convince of doing so face-to-face.\n'Victor's' force, along with 'Michael Baldwin's' ( Christian LeBlanc ) prior voluntarily offer to take 'Adam's' case, supercharges the likelihood that a jury trial proves 'Victor, Junior' did not accidentally run down 'Delia'. Dad's specific involvement in his son's case will not only help to reveal who the true car killer is, but also establish the unlikely return of 'Adam' to the fold at Newman Enterprises. While this conjecture is stretched, it's not far-fetched.\nThis scribe, like all hardcore soap devotees, believes that 'Adam' couldn't possibly have killed 'Delia' on that fated night nearly two years ago. Michael Muhney (then playing 'Adam') and Billy Miller (then playing 'Billy') created some of the best confrontational scenes within YR's realm through the fall of 2013. Their descendants, Hartley and Burgess Jenkins, are now employed, as well as artistically obliged, to deliver a final resolution to this still-raging vendetta. And they will.", "external_links": ["http://www.cbs.com/shows/the_young_and_the_restless/", "https://twitter.com/EBraeden?lang=en", "http://justinhartleyonline.com/"], "published": "2015-10-10T01:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:13:16.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
