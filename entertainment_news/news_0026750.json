You just need to get there. The vaccine lasts through the flu season, which is tracked through April, so you're covered if you get immunized before the solstice.\nBut getting that shot falls a little later on most people’s to-do list. Flu typically is most prevalent in the Rochester-area in January. Inasmuch as it takes a couple of week for the vaccine to do its job, the traditional time for vaccination for kids and adults has been between the end of Daylight Savings Time and early December.\n“The real driver is how much flu is in the community,” said Nancy Adams executive director of the Monroe County Medical Society. “If it’s after Thanksgiving and we haven’t seen a lot of flu, people get complacent. If it’s Thanksgiving and everybody and their brother is sick, I think people tend to say, ‘I can get it.’”\nA few days ago, Adams expressed worry about slow delivery of vaccine, particularly for children younger than 3. But that seems to be abating. Officials with Rochester Regional Health and UR Medicine report their primary care practices have adequate supply for people with commercial insurance.\nAdams also was concerned about delays with the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Vaccines for Children program, which serves Medicaid-eligible children or those with no insurance in private practices and in federally qualified health centers, a worry that seems justified.\nThe Anthony L. Jordan Health Center for instance, has received only 20 percent of what it has ordered, according to chief operating officer Jason Dunn. He said the health center is continuing to place orders, but at this point it is giving vaccine to children at high risk. He said he expects that by the time flu season hits, the center has enough vaccine for all eligible children.\nLate or inconsistent delivery of vaccine, especially for children, creates a time-management problem for parents, particularly those who rely on a bus to get to an appointment.\n“Back in day when only kids that received the flu vaccine were kids at high risk and pediatricians maybe giving 10 to 20 doses a year, we would start in December,” said Dr. Edward Lewis, a pediatrician in Brighton.\n“Now because the recommendations are everybody over the age of 6 months (be immunized), it’s really impractical to try to get everybody in within a couple of months. So we start earlier and earlier and earlier.”\nWhen kids come for physicals or check-ups, “We need to take advantage of all those visits so we’re not slammed in November and December,” Lewis said. “I’ll give vaccine to kids in March if they haven’t had it.”\nAccording to the state Department of Health, two of six manufacturers have nationwide delays in shipping vaccine for private practices as well as for the Vaccines for Children program. However, the state said CDC estimated that as of Sept. 25, 2015, over half of this season’s supply had been distributed to healthcare providers and pharmacies. Some pediatrician offices still are slow to get the nasal vaccine, meaning some kids may have to have an injection.\nPhysicians say that pharmacies tend to get their supplies first, likely because they place the largest orders. In New York, pharmacists are authorized to administer vaccines only to people 18 years and older. However, the state says that some pharmacies contract with nurses or physicians to administer vaccines at on-site clinics, and those practitioners can administer flu vaccines to any age.\nThe urgency for the vaccine is understandable. Every fall brings legitimate concerns about the potential severity of the flu season and the supply of vaccine.\nApproximately 50,000 people a year in the U.S. die from complications of the flu and pneumonia, according to the CDC.\nIt’s common for hospitals to restrict the number of visitors during flu season, and that happened last year, when a spike in early- to mid-December gave Monroe County had an unusually high number of laboratory confirmed cases for the season.\nAs of Oct. 8, the health department said the county had yet to have a confirmed case. But not everyone who has flu sees a doctor, so it’s possible there are people with symptoms. The experts said it’s still early. But as last year showed, the timing and intensity can be unpredictable. To paraphrase the late Yogi Berra, with flu out there, it can get late early.\nPSINGER@Gannett.com\nPatti Singer is the Democrat and Chronicle's Clean Living reporter.
