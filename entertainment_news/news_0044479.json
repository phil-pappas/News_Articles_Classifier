There was no “Ray of Light,” “Like a Prayer” or “Express Yourself,” but instead she turned in refurbished versions of “True Blue,” “Dress You Up,” “Frozen” and “Who’s That Girl.” Madonna has always had fun playing with her catalog, and “Like a Virgin” has been remixed all sorts of ways over the years, but on Thursday it was presented as a mid-’00s hip-hop jam (think Ciara’s “Goodies”).\nDETROIT NEWS\nTake a pow: Madonna visits Detroit youth boxing program\nDETROIT NEWS\nMadonna: 10 cuts beyond the hits\nDETROIT NEWS\nMadonna still playing by one set of rules: Her own\nMadonna received plenty of blow back earlier this year for some unflattering remarks she made about her home state, but on Thursday she was full of nothing but love for Detroit and Michigan. “Motor City, are you ready to party?” she asked early on. “The hometown girl is back!”\nShe later shouted out her father and her daughter, who were in the crowd, along with students from Detroit’s Downtown Boxing Gym. She also had kind words for Dan Gilbert and said she was proud to be part of Detroit’s revival.\n“Detroit is making a comeback, so watch out!” she said. “I said watch out!
