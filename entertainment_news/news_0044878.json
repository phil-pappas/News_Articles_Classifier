She will speak at October's PINK event. \nDuring one of the most harrowing periods of her life, Amy Robach wasn't afforded the privilege of privacy. \nThe \"Good Morning America\" news co-anchor agreed to receive a mammogram on air for a Breast Cancer Awareness Month segment. She was convinced to do so by producers and her fellow anchor, breast cancer survivor Robin Roberts. \nRoberts told Robach that if the segment saved just one life, it would be worth it. \nOn Oct. 1, 2013, Robach had a mammogram on live television. After completing follow-up tests, she announced Nov. 11, 2013, on television that she had breast cancer. Robach was 40 when she was diagnosed. Related Tim Gunn says fashion career chose him; will speak Oct. 3 at Pink: A Women's Event \nTim Gunn has plenty to say about the state of fashion today, and he'll share his views at Pink: A Women's Event Oct. 3 in Lancaster. What he doesn't like is people buying trendy clothes for the sake of a trend. \nPublic service \n\"I did not realize it was going to be as personal as it was,\" Robach told Variety magazine. \"When I agreed to the mammogram, I was convinced to by producers and by Robin (Roberts), and it was a public service that ended up saving my life.\" \nRobach will speak at PINK: A Women's Event, a showcase produced by LNP and sponsored by Lancaster General Health. \nRobach underwent a double mastectomy, breast reconstruction and eight rounds of chemotherapy to fight the disease. She told People magazine that she's taking tamoxifen during her recovery to prevent the cancer from returning. She'll be on the drug for 10 years. \nRobach recounts her diagnosis and treatment in her new book, \"Better,\" released Sept. 29. \nRobach's #GIRLPOWER series on \"GMA\" features influential and inspiring women.
