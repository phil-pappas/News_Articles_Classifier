And who has returned (them)?\" Sobhana quickly added that she won't return hers. When reporters pressed for details, the actress said: \"Maybe someone has returned the award because they got it late in their life. I am not going to return the award that I got.\" When it was pointed out the awards were returned in protest against the killing of Kannada writer MM Kalburgi and the lynching of the Muslim man in Uttar Pradesh, she said she was not aware of the happenings.\nShe appeared to have no clue even about eminent Kerala writer Sarah Joseph's decision to return her Kendra Sahitya Academy award. Sobhana hails from the Kerala capital but now lives in Chennai. She was here to take part in the 38th edition of the Soorya Festival.
