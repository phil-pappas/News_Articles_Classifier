At the end of the month, each of our judges will name their Top 3 area favorites. \nHere is today's short and sweet review: \nGEORGIO'S PIZZA - HOUSE SPECIAL \nI ordered the House Special from Georgio's. It's a good pizza, don't get me wrong, but I'm not a fan of meat toppings. So I, personally, should have ordered something else. That being said, it's good. The crust is a little thicker than I'd like, but I'd gladly eat this again. It's the most visually appealing pizza I've reviewed so far. \nGeorgio's Pizza , 300 E. Cervantes St. Pensacola.
