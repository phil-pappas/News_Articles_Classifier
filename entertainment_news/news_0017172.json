He is also the Founder and Chairman of El Rey Network, the new genrebusting English-language cable network. While a student at the University of Texas at Austin in 1991, Robert Rodriguez wrote the script to his first feature film while sequestered at a drug research facility as a paid subject in a clinical experiment. That pay-check covered the cost of shooting his film. He planned to make the money back by selling the film to the Mexican home video market. \nThe film, \"El Mariachi,\" went on to win the coveted Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival, and became the lowest budget movie ever released by a major studio. Rodriguez wrote about these experiences in Rebel Without a Crew, a perennial guide for the independent filmmaker.\nRodriguez went on to write, produce, direct and edit a series of successful films including Desperado, From Dusk Till Dawn, The Faculty, the Spy Kids franchise, Once Upon a Time in Mexico , Frank Miller's Sin City, The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3D, Grindhouse, Machete and Sin City 2: A Dame To Kill For. \nIn 2000, Rodriguez founded Troublemaker Studios, an Austin, Texas based production facility of which he is co-owner and president. In 2010, he launched Quick Draw Productions a development, production and financing company which gives Rodriguez \"green light\" capabilities to develop and produce his own media projects across film, television, gaming and interactive platforms while closely controlling the creative process. \nRobert Rodriguez resides in Austin, Texas . \nABOUT TROUBLEMAKER STUDIOS \nLocated inside the decommissioned Robert Mueller Airport complex, Troublemaker retrofitted this expansive site into a state-of-the-art production facility, capable of accommodating multiple productions simultaneously and featuring ample on-site production, fabrication and post facilities. The studio includes a world-renowned visual effects house, music and publishing arms and has played a primary role in making Austin a vibrant filmmaking hub. \nTroublemaker Studios has proudly served as home to a number of Film and Television productions including From Dusk Till Dawn Season One, Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, Machete, Predators, Grindhouse, Sin City, The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D and the Spy Kids series. \nTroublemaker Studios were opened in 2001 to accommodate the production needs of director Robert Rodriguez and producer Elizabeth Avellan. \nABOUT HAPPY SOCKS \nBringing happiness and quality to every corner of the world.
