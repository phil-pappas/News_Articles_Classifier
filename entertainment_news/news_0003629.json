One explanation is that people who have higher reactive rebelliousness may respond to disappointing and frustrating events by getting tattooed\".\n\"That is, when these individuals experience a negative emotional event, they may be more likely to react by pursuing an act that is seen as defiant. The act of tattooing is perceived as rebellious, or more generally tattoos themselves can signify defiance or dissent\".\n\"On the other hand, there were no significant differences between tattooed and non-tattooed adults in proactive rebelliousness. It is possible that this form of rebelliousness, which is hedonistic and goal-driven, is at odds with the pain and permanence of tattoos\".\nHere's what we think of your science, Viren.\nVia Telegraph\nMORE: Pics: Conor McGregor just added two more tattoos to his chest\nMORE: Tinder's new feature triples your chances of getting a match\nMORE: Volkswagen to recall nearly 80,00 cars on Irish roads", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/zxQq1wB7A28", "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/11935523/People-with-tattoos-are-more-likely-to-be-aggressive.html"], "published": "2015-10-19T21:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:10:50.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
