Carrey was photographed embracing White's family members as the coffin was lowered into the ground. \nHer body was discovered by friends visiting her rented Sherman Oaks, California, home Sept. 28, two days after the third anniversary of her father's death. Officials who arrived at the scene found four different kinds of powerful medication and suicide notes that mentioned her famous ex, who she had reportedly split from days earlier. \nA low key memorial service had also taken place earlier this week at the Zorthian Ranch in Altadena, California, where her U.S.-based friends and loved ones paid their final respects, reports Mirror.co.uk. \nShe and Carrey had been dating on and off since 2012. In a statement released shortly after her death, Carrey wrote, \"I am deeply saddened by the passing of my sweet Cathriona... She was a truly kind and delicate Irish flower, too sensitive for this soil, to whom loving and being loved was all that sparkled. My heart goes out to her family and friends and to everyone who loved and cared about her.\" Copyright WENN.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T21:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:31:44.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
