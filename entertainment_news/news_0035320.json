The narrator in \"The Devil in his Youth\" lurks on the fringes of many of these songs, Beelzebub re-emerges again a few songs later in \"Uncle Mother's\" as a sinister doorman welcoming passersby to hell in the guise of a saloon. \"Leave your children in the car,\" he hisses.\nThe folks who accept the invite might think they control their fate, but these soon-to-be-ordinary people quickly discover that they're in control of very little. \"They don't see us,\" Joe Casey repeats as the album winds down, a tiny speck talking to the world and perhaps to God.\nIf that sounds depressing, it's not. Casey — to call him a singer would be overdoing it — takes the perspective that even if we're all just making do, there's no reason to despair. As he declares in \"Pontiac 87,\" \"There's no use in being sad about it/What's the point of crying about it?\"\nTough-minded yet tender at the most unexpected moments, Casey finds the human heart in this wasteland and celebrates it. His voice — a mix of barfly ranting and darn near poetic street musings in the tradition of Algren, Bukowski, Burroughs and (Lou) Reed — is the perfect instrument for delivering these songs. It would be wrong to prettify them. Instead, Casey's gray, no-nonsense voice creates the precise environment for these characters to come alive.\nThe band delivers too. The performances of guitarist Greg Ahee, drummer Alex Leonard and bassist Scott Davidson verge on matter-of-fact, like a terse exchange between loud talkers at the end of the bar. They present their songs as quick jabs without any wasted motion, models of concision and power that rival that of any rock band.\nAhee values sound as much as notes, and he brings spectral spaciousness to \"Clandestine Time\" and \"Cowards Starve,\" heavy waves to \"The Devil in his Youth\" and a screaming approximation of Bernard Herrmann's \"Psycho\" strings to \"Uncle Mother's.\" Leonard and Davidson lock into an attitude: They're relentless, with no patience for splashy cymbal work or fancy riffing to gum things up. The tsunami is broken only by occasional bursts of near silence, as if a stranded swimmer caught up in the tumult suddenly breaks the surface to gulp for air.\nProtomartyr brought raw emotion to life Bob Gendron Protomartyr vocalist Joe Casey often conveyed the impression of a harmless drunken crank bellied up to a dive bar Thursday at a packed Lincoln Hall.

In \"Why Does it Shake?,\" the narrator (which Casey has said was at least partially inspired by his mother) comments on what's happening to her body as she ages and breaks down. Fear and frailty replaces youthful bravado, and certainty turns into an unanswerable question. But the void is filled in the next song, \"Ellen,\" about a couple separated by death and their hoped-for reunion in the afterlife. This is quite possibly Protomartyr's first love song, and the ascendant music lifts the words out of despair and replaces it with hope.\nThe Agent Intellect\nProtomartyr\n4 stars (out of 4)\nGreg Kot is a Tribune Newspapers critic.\ngreg@gregkot.com\nTwitter @gregkot\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5618102a/turbine/sc-music-protomartyr-ent-1009-20151009", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54b910fe/turbine/ct-protomartyr-review-lincoln-hall-joe-casey-20150116"], "published": "2015-10-09T22:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:59:12.992+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
