FILE - In this Aug. 12, 2013 file photo, Stephenie Meyer attends a screening of Sony PIctures Classics' \"Austenland\" in New York. Meyer acknowledges her new book isn’t exactly “new.” Appearing Thursday, Oct. 8, 2015, at New York Comic Con, the author spoke of the 10th anniversary edition of the first book of her blockbuster “Twilight” series. The release includes the original “Twilight” along with “Life and Death,” essentially the same story, except she switched the names and genders of the main characters, with Bella and Edward now Beau and Edythe.
