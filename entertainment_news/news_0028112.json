Edward N. Cahn of Blank Rome.\n\"Right now we are painted with the brush of 'kids for cash,' pornography here in Philadelphia, indictments in Allegheny county” states Pennsylvania Supreme Court candidate Judge Michael George. “We have just got to change what we are doing.”\n“This is also an historic election because of the historic number of openings,” says candidate Judge Kevin Dougherty. “The last time there were three vacancies on the court was 1704. William Penn was governor of Pennsylvania and the monarch of England selected the candidates.\"\nSome question whether it’s time to ditch judicial elections altogether. Thus far the seven candidates have collectively raised over $5 million. “Judges need to spend money and secure contributions from lawyers to get elected to their office,” says Judge Cahn. “It should be ended.”\nThe American Law Journal was nominated for four Mid-Atlantic Emmy® awards in 2015 and winner of the interview/discussion program category.
