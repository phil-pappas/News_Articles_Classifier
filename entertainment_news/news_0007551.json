Brandon McNeal, 24, was charged by a criminal complaint and faces a minimum of 10 years in prison, a maximum of life in prison, and a $1,000,000 fine.\nAccording to the criminal complaint, McNeal allegedly advertised the services of a 14-year-old on the website Backpages.com. That led to the minor committing commercial sex acts.\nMcNeal appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge Marian Payson for a detention hearing on Wednesday. He was released and will return to court on Nov. 17 for a status conference.\nWCLEVELAND@Gannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:04:40.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
