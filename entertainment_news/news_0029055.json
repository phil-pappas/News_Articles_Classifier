Still painting into his 90s, his subject and style never wavered. Photo: Adam Wright \nRobert Dickerson, \"the last man standing\" of The Antipodean art movement with an immediately recognisable figurative style, has died at the age of 91.\nDickerson, who died in Nowra on Friday, was still painting into his 90s. His subject matter and style – unique, aquiline renditions of the human form against urban and rural backdrops – never wavered.\n\"He was the last man standing,\" Brisbane gallerist Philip Bacon said last year of Dickerson as he staged a retrospective of the artist's work, which fetched record prices at auction in 2014.\nThe Sydney-based Dickerson founded The Antipodeans in 1959 with Melbourne artists including Arthur Boyd and Charles Blackman (the last surviving member of the movement, Blackman is still alive but no longer paints). \nAdvertisement The self-taught Dickerson's path to becoming a full-time artist was unconventional and included stints as a boxer and factory worker.\nIn 1957, along with Boyd and Nolan, he was commissioned for an  Australian Women's Weekly  promotion to decorate a Kelvinator fridge.\n\nWith three children and his first wife to support, he put the 100-pound fee on a horse that won and quit factory life forever to paint.\nThe retrospective at Bacon's gallery in July last year realised $500,000 plus – his best show yet – including a record $180,000  for  Boy Playing With Ball  (1965). A month later his 1954 painting  The Bottle  fetched a record $183,000 at Sotheby's mid-year Sydney sale.\nDickerson is \"the last man standing of The Antipodean art movement and has an immediately recognisable style, not just by the cognoscenti​, but by the general public,\" Bacon told Fairfax Media ahead of the exhibition. \"The recent record auction price can only cement his standing into the future.\"\nIn September 2014 Dickerson and Blackman were awarded $150,000 damages each against Melbourne art dealer Peter Gant​ in a landmark legal battle which saw Judge Peter Vickery order in 2010 that two Blackman paintings and one Dickerson pastel drawing proven forgeries be destroyed.\nHe is survived by wife Jennifer, a writer who also runs Dickerson Galleries in Sydney, seven children, three step-children, 25 grandchildren, three great-grandchildren and one great-great-grandchild.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T06:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:49:16.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
