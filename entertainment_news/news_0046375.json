Jennifer Sheehan Contact Reporter Of The Morning Call I visited five Lehigh Valley coffee shops that offer great coffee and ambience. \nThere are a few things essential to daily life. \nAdequate sleep. Nourishing food. And coffee. \nOf course, decent coffee is available nearly everywhere, from gas stations and rest stops to supermarkets and big chain stores. And that type of coffee will do the trick, giving you that burst of energy needed to get through the day. \nBut excellent coffee can be enjoyed, savored like a fine wine or a great craft beer. \nSo I put aside my major-chain coffee habit and set out on a search for locally owned, independently operated Lehigh Valley coffee shops. \nThe Valley has many fine coffee shops. Based on word of mouth and social media suggestions, I visited five great ones that offer an array of coffee, treats and ambience. \nLike a cup of coffee, each shop has its own personality and flavor. \nSouth Mountain Cycles and Cafe \nThe lowdown: I stopped by South Mountain in Emmaus with Stephanie Sigafoos , a Morning Call co-worker and sister in caffeine addiction. \nSouth Mountain is a bike dealership and repair shop that serves the cycling community in the Emmaus area. Inside is a great place for coffee, and you don't have to be a cyclist to enjoy it. \nYou can stop in for a great cup of coffee and look out the large window to Emmaus' Triangle, or stop in after visiting the Emmaus Farmers Market on Sundays. And there's free Wi-Fi. ... (Jennifer Sheehan) \nThe coffee: All the coffee and dairy products at South Mountain are organic. I had what I would describe as a regular, straightforward cup of dark-roast coffee. The first thing I noticed was the freshness. It was delicious and with a bitter note like good coffee should have. Stephanie had a salted-caramel twist to her hot coffee and she enjoyed it. Sweet without being over the top. Both coffees were reasonably priced ($3.50 total). \nSouth Mountain offers other coffee drinks, too, from iced lattes and mochas to cappuccinos and macchiatos. \nCoffee's closest companion is biscotti, an oblong, not-too-sweet crunchy cookie. South Mountain's are from Bucks County Biscotti Co. I had a chocolate-dipped biscotti ($2.25) and it was pretty amazing. Thick chocolate covering over one side, and that crunchy texture you expect from a good biscotti. \nOther deliciousness: South Mountain sells sweet and savory pastries such as scones, danish and muffins as well as cookies and bear claws. \nHours: 7 a.m.-7 p.m. Monday through Friday; 8 a.m.-4 p.m. Saturday; 9 a.m.-2 p.m. Sunday \nInfo: 337 Chestnut St., Emmaus; 610-967-4490; www.southmountaincycle.com \nTerra Cafe \nThe lowdown: Easton's Terra Cafe offers a cozy spot for good coffee, just off Centre Square near the Crayola Experience. \nI've stopped in there several times before the Wednesday night Easton Farmers Market for iced caffeine. When I was thinking of doing this story, I knew Terra Cafe would be on my list. \nInside, it's cozy and you can check out local artwork displayed around the cafe. The artwork changes every month and the cafe will often have receptions to let you meet the artists. (Kathy Lauer-Williams) \nThere's a nice spot outside to sit and drink your coffee if the weather is nice. \nThe coffee: Terra Cafe gets its coffee from Homestead Coffee Roasters of Upper Black Eddy, Bucks County. The coffee is fair trade and mostly organic. On my latest stop, I had a large iced coffee (perfect for that warm morning). A chocolate biscotti was dark, rich and not too sweet with a great crunchy texture. My iced coffee was $3.50 and biscotti was $2. \nOther deliciousness: Terra Cafe has a nice sized menu for a small spot, with breakfast and lunch options (even some veggie and vegan items). Amazing smoothies, too. \nHours: 6 a.m.-5 p.m. Monday through Friday; 7 a.m.-5 p.m. Saturdays; 8 a.m.-5 p.m. Sundays \nInfo: 321 Northampton St., Easton; 610-330-6900; www.facebook.com/terracafe \nHava Java \nThe lowdown: Allentown's Hava Java near the 19th Street Theatre is a locally owned neighborhood spot that's more than just a place to drink coffee. \nInside it's like being in someone's hip Brooklyn apartment, with cozy sofas and eclectic furnishings (take note of the ceiling that's lined with coffee cups.) \nIt's also a place that celebrates local creativity and up-and-coming artists. Hava Java holds an art show once a month, spotlighting a local artist, and displays the works in the cafe. \nAnyone who's familiar with Hava Java will tell you about its open mike night, held at 7 p.m. each Friday. Local musicians are encouraged to come and sing (especially if it's original music). If you come on a Saturday you'll hear a performance by a local band. \nThe coffee: Trust me, this is good coffee. \nHava Java is known for its quality coffee and espresso drinks. All their coffee is organic and non-GMO. I had a fantastic cup of its house-blend coffee ($2.25 for a small). I paired it with a coconut biscotti ($3), which was delicious, with a delicate coconut flavor. \nThe menu: Hava Java has other desserts such as cookies, cupcakes, cakes and pastries. \nHours: 8 a.m.-11 p.m. Monday to Thursday; 8 a.m.-midnight Friday and Saturday; 10 a.m.-10 p.m. Sunday. \nInfo: 526 N. 19th St., Allentown; 610-432-3045. \nJava Joint \nThe lowdown: We are all pressed for time and some days we just want to get a cup of coffee in a hurry. If you're near Trexlertown, stop at Java Joint, a tiny kiosk on Hamilton Boulevard that's packed with bold coffee flavor and friendly service. \nThe coffee: I got a small hot vanilla latte that was delicious, full of creamy vanilla flavor. And despite it being 7:30 a.m., I got a biscotti (don't tell my kids.) I chose the salted caramel flavor. Super crunchy (as a biscotti should be), a hint of salt, a good caramel flavor. The price for my small latte and biscotti was $5.30. And I had great, friendly service. I may need to drive my daughter to middle school more often so I have an excuse to get coffee here. \nOther deliciousness: Java Joint has doughnuts, scones, bagels, sticky buns and sometimes cannoli, which they get from local bakeries. \nInfo: 7370 Hamilton Blvd., Trexlertown; 610-530-3171; www.javajointdrivethru.com \nThe Wise Bean \nThe lowdown: Co-worker Stephanie Sigafoos and I stopped by The Wise Bean in Bethlehem, a diminutive coffee cafe tucked away on North New Street. Several people had tweeted me about it, urging me to give a try. \nThe coffee: I have had cappuccino from many places. What I got at The Wise Bean was far and away the best I've ever had. No exaggeration. Often, the foam of a cappuccino deflates within seconds. Not from The Wise Bean. Our cappuccinos had a thick, creamy foam. Who needs artistic drizzles when you have lasting foam? The espresso shots had a dark, intense flavor you expect without bitterness. We also had a splash of vanilla flavor in our cappuccinos, which kicked the flavor up. Really, really good. (Cost for a large: $5.50.) \nIf a latte is your cup of coffee, The Wise Bean does those too, along with cafe mocha, cafe au lait and espresso, and other coffee drinks. They also have free Wi-Fi. \nThe menu: Steph and I had a cinnamon-swirl pastry that was flaky and delicious. The Wise Bean, which gets its pastries from local bakeries, also has bagels, muffins and cookies. \nHours: 7 a.m.-7 p.m. Monday to Friday; 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Saturday; closed Sunday \nInfo: 634 N.
