Enter rapper Lupe Fiasco and Google Executive Di-Ann Eisnor, who have teamed up on a million dollar search for a savvy entrepreneur to focus on making improvements in poverty-stricken and marginalized neighborhoods.\nFast Company is reporting that the Neighborhood Start Fund will kick off in Brownsville, New York on Nov. 13 and will function on a two pronged plan: 1) search for ideas in overlooked neighborhoods and 2) redirect profits from successful startups back into the community.\nAn official statement regarding the project breaks it down further:\nEisnor, Fiasco, and other judges will hear business ideas from would-be Brownsville entrepreneurs. Finalists in the competition (Brownsville residents can apply here ) will compete for $5,000 to turn ideas into prototypes, and will also have access to mentorship and free technology services.‚Äù\nBy next year Fiasco and Eisnor hope to develop the project into a $100 million dollar company, and to expand into dozens of neighborhoods.\nh/t Complex", "external_links": ["https://www.younoodle.com/competitions/dream_big_foundation", "http://www.complex.com/music/2015/10/lupe-fiasco-one-million-entrepreneur-search", "http://www.fastcompany.com/3052616/most-creative-people/lupe-fiasco-and-a-waze-exec-make-a-million-dollar-bet-on-inner-city-inn"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:19:58.658+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
