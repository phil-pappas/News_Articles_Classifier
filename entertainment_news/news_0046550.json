It has a narrative structure rarely seen in Indian movies,\" says Jiju. The shoot has begun in Mumbai and Rajshri is cast opposite Sanal Aman, who appears as the taxi driver. The film will have all the languages that is spoken by Mumbaiites including Malayalam, English and Hindi.\nRajshri had earlier done a remarkable role in the Malayalam film Haram. \"Rajshri is a highly talented actress, and an asset for our film. She is trained in kathakali and lavani dance, and her passions include kalaripayattu and stick fighting,\" Jiju explains.\nApart from Rajshri and Sanal, the crowdfunded film has Malayali actress Shruthi Menon along with Shwetha Padda, Akanksha Gade and Sudeep Modak. \"Shruthi is one among the women in Prashanth's life. She acts as a typical urban girl. We had planned to cast Kani Kusruti in our film but she had to back out due to illness at the last minute,\" says Jiju.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:35:11.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
