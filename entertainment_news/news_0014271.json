Image: Penn State Ivyside Dance Ensemble offers array of choreographers for fall performance September 30, 2015 Ivyside Dance Ensemble offers array of choreographers for fall performance \nPenn State Altoona’s Ivyside Dance Ensemble will perform at 7:30 p.m. Nov. 5 to 6, in the Misciagna Family Center for Performing Arts. Tickets are $5 for Penn State Altoona students and $7 for general admission. Children under 12 are free. \nTwenty-one student dancers will take part in the performance which features new works by faculty and student choreographers. \nInspired by stories of Altoona's railway history, emerging dance guest artist Marcus White marries hip-hop and contemporary dance styles in a two-section dance work. Josh Barr, a 2012 graduate of Penn State Altoona who recently completed his MFA at Oklahoma University, combines classical ballet movement with post-modern choreographic technique in “Jeux,” providing a unique artistic challenge for dancers and a fresh viewing experience for the audience. \n“Elevation,” is choreographed by senior dance minor Cassandra Lewis. Originally developed as a class project, “Elevation” was chosen for the mainstage based on its strong choreographic merits. Company director Caitlin Osborne brings back her popular vaudeville inspired piece, “No Tenth Act.” This work includes nine short dances, all drawing from the age of vaudeville – tap, jazz, and eccentric styles to 1920’s ragtime music. This piece is recreated as part of a program-wide vaudeville project which includes a full period vaudeville show produced by the theatre program scheduled for December. The Ensemble’s program is rounded out by KT Huckabee’s “Ghosties, Ghoulies, and Long-Legged Beasties.” \nTickets for the performance may be purchased at the box office, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday through Friday, and before and during all performances.
