After the release of the action-drama 'Daagdi Chaawl', fans of Marathi cinema's action hero Ankush Chaudhary poured milk on a big poster of the actor outside a cinema hall in Mumbai to show their love for him. This draws similarities to instances in the south where posters of Rajinikanth have been treated the same way and some of their stars even have temples dedicated to them. While there's no temple yet, the 'doodh abhishek' looks to be a start for Ankush on that way.\nWatch the video here\nAnkush's name is synonymous to 'Marathi Superstar' and there's hardly anyone who can match his style, especially when it comes to action. This year has been a great one for the actor with three hits 'Classmates', 'Double Seat' and now Chandrakant Kanse's 'Daagdi Chaawl' which is running to packed theatres.\nDaagdi Chaawl Review\nWATCH: The trailer of Daagdi Chaawl:", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/DaagdiChaawl/videos/vb.757988667662252/780922978702154/?type=2&theater", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/9y5ImqDEeJo"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:53:59.278+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
