The rock legend plays a workman who offers to tarmac a driveway. \nWhile footballing legend Steve Bull also puts in an appearance - as does TV presenter Nick Owen from Midlands Today. \nDoreen creator David Tristram, aged 58, who grew up in Quarry Bank, said: \"I appreciate them for being good sports - it's obviously brought a higher profile to the piece. They all said they enjoyed the experience; hopefully they'll be coming along to have a look at it.\" Share article \nHe said the reaction to the Doreen The Movie trailer has \"been phenomenal\", adding: \"It was shared over 150,000 times on Facebook, that was amazing.\" \nThe screening at Netherton Arts Centre, Northfield Road, Netherton, starts at 7.30pm and tickets, priced £10 to £12 can be bought online at http://lazycowdoreen.weebly.com/ Promoted Stories Famous names including Robert Plant and Steve Bull make cameo appearances in Doreen The Movie Sorry, an error occurred.
