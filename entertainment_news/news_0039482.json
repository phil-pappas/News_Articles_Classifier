The global energy-based therapeutics market to grow at a CAGR of 7.30% over the period 2014-2019. \nEnergy-based therapeutics involves the use of energy fields. These therapies include technologies such as microwave, radiofrequency, hydro-mechanical, cryotherapy, thermal, and ultrasound, which are used for either treatment or destruction of tissues to remove pathology. Energy-based therapies work on the mechanism of altering energy fields around patient's body, which can initiate healing and wellness. \nThe report includes the present scenario and the growth prospects of the global energy-based therapeutics market for 2015-2019. The market can be segmented into clinical applications: general surgery, ophthalmic, and aesthetic. \nA major trend is in the rising popularity of physician-owned ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs). Since most energy-based procedures do not necessarily require hospital stays, surgeons have started performing minimally invasive surgeries in ambulatory centers. The reimbursements provided in these outpatient settings encourage doctors to perform energy-based procedures in their own ASCs.\nAccording to the report, the increasing demand for aesthetic surgeries is a major driver contributing to the market growth. There has been a rise in the demand for high-quality and affordable cosmetic surgical procedures such as non-invasive aesthetic treatments. \nFurther, the report states that the varied regulations for medical devices are among the major challenges faced by the market during the forecast period.\nKey Vendors \nJohnson & Johnson Lumenis Syneron Medical Other Prominent Vendors \nAbbott Medical Optics Alcon Alna Medical System Angiodynamic AngioDynamics AtriCure biolitec Boston Scientific Bovie Medical Cardiogenesis Cutera Cynosure Dornier MedTech Ellex InSightec IRIDEX Lightmed Mederi Therapeutics Medtronic Optos Photocure PhotoMedex Quantel Medical Radiancy Schwind Sichuan Jinjiang Electronic Science and Technology SonaCare Medical StarMedTec Ziemer Ophthalmic Systems For more information visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/sfndqc/global \nMedia Contact: \nLaura Wood , +353-1-481-1716, press@researchandmarkets.net \n \n\nSOURCE Research and Markets\n\n\nRELATED LINKS\nhttp://www.researchandmarkets.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T11:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T11:24:48.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
