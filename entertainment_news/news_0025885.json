Posted just a moment ago \nHelen Sloan/HBO (NEW YORK) -- New York Comic Con blasted off at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in the Big Apple on Thursday, and for the next three days, fanboys and fangirls of every stripe will be up to their rubber Spock ears in games, gear, and gobs of news about their favorite movies and TV shows. \nOn the first day of NYCC, the most anticipated celebrity panel was for the HBO hit Game of Thrones , and it was there that one of the cast members might have let slip a spoiler on the fate of Jon Snow, who as far as fans know (SPOILER ALERT!) apparently didn't survive the last season's finale. \nWhen the three actors on the panel were asked which character they would like to do a scene with, Keisha Castle-Hughes answered \"Jon Snow.\" Was that a spoiler? Is Snow in fact still alive? It will be months before we know, but it's clear what the fans want: When actor Finn Jones asked the room which character they want to see resurrected, and the fans erupted, \"John Snow!\" \nSilicon Valley star TJ Miller, who will be seen next year in the eagerly anticipated Deadpool film, summed up annual festival smartly: \"You can really be a weirdo here and not have anyone give you a second look, which is really great.\" \nThe convention runs till Sunday. Hundreds of thousands of fans are expected to turn out for the sold-out event. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:59:58.862+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
