From the Sunbeam Alpine in the 1962 Dr. No to this year's Aston Martin, the cars paraded down the Champs Elysees on Sunday after arraying in front of the Arc de Triomphe. Minus the submarine car from The Spy Who Loved Me, the display comes before the release of Spectre this fall and includes the Aston Martin DB10 created for the film, which features in a chase scene through the streets of Rome. That scene combined to give Spectre a dizzying $34 million price tag in wrecked vehicles, notes Tech Times . \"We set the record for smashing up cars on Spectre,\" the film's stunt coordinator says. \"In Rome, we wrecked millions of pounds worth. They were going into the Vatican at top speeds of 110mph. We shot one entire night for four seconds of film.\" Among the carnage: Seven Aston Martin DB10s (10 were produced for the movie) and a Jaguar C-X75. (Don't look for Daniel Craig to play Bond again .) An Aston Martin DB10 and DB5 on display, near the Arc of Triomphe, in Paris, Sunday, Oct. 11, 2015.
