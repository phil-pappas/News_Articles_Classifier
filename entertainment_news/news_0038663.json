Based on an idea that negative personality traits can be overcome and changed to positive ones, the film features an ensemble cast that includes Ananth Nag, Chethan Chandra, Ritesh Kumar, Shalini Vadnikatti, Sudha Rani, Sruthi Hariharan and Suchendra Prasad. The Kannada film industry's current favourite character artist, P Ravi Shankar, is seen in two avatars â€” a first for him so far.\nThe music, rendered by Bharath BJ (of Simplag Ondu Love Story fame), includes five songs, and three musical themes that enhance the drama. \"A highlight among them is a shloka sung by Ananth Nag,\" writer-actor-producer Ritesh tells us. \"The timing of the release of such a film is just right, especially since the audience seems to be opening up to stories that do not follow the regular commercial film formula of late,\" adds Ritesh.\nThe film has been jointly produced by Filmy People Productions and Honna Heights.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:15:13.923+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
