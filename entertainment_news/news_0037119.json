A magnificently sultry Carmen in the alluring shape of Russian mezzo-soprano Elena Maximova \nHis fate is particularly tragic in this production as Micaela, the country girl to whom he was betrothed, is played by Australian soprano Nicole Car quite magnificently. \nHer delightful voice perfectly conveys the innocence, vulnerability and emotion of the part and she fully deserved the huge applause she received from the audience on the first night. \nThe US tenor Bryan Hymel gave a strong performance as Don Jose, but his voice lacks the warmth needed to make this wimpish corporal likeable. \nHis rival, Escamillo (Alexander Vinogradov) also had a beautifully strong voice and general rather wooden personality, but at least he entered on a beautiful black horse and killed a few bulls offstage. Just the soprt of thing to appeal to Carmen, I suppose. PH You don't need to change or update great operas to get the best out of them \nThis revival of Francesca Zambello's production is gloriously traditional and shows that you don't need to change or update great operas to get the best out of them. \nWith Bertrand de Billy achieving a splendidly vigorous effect from the orchestra with some excellent control of changes of pace, this is certainly a Carmen to savour. \nBox Office: 020 7304 4000 or www.roh.org.uk (until November 30) Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:41:53.997+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
