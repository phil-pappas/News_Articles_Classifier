Friends shared smiles and beers. Dogs frolicked in the sun and people lounged in the shade. Hugs were everywhere. \nNo wonder there was such a strong sense of deja vu as the 15th annual Hardly Strictly Bluegrass festival got underway on Friday at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. Sure, the musical lineup changes each year, but the scene -- so warm, inviting and neighborly -- remains the same. \nThat's amazing, especially for an event that has experienced such incredible growth over the years. This year's three-day event, which continues through Sunday, was expected to draw some 750,000 people. That's nearly twice as many as attended the most famous music festival of all time — Woodstock in 1969. \nThe scene — or, if you prefer, vibe -- is certainly one of the festival's biggest drawing cards. It's right up there with the price of admission (free). Another major attraction, of course, is the lineup, which always features dozens of incredibly talented country, blues, roots, rock and, yes, bluegrass artists. \nThis year's bill is certainly no exception to the rule. The top acts include Michael Franti, Emmylou Harris and Rodney Crowell, Los Lobos, Flogging Molly, Boz Scaggs, Gillian Welch, Paul Weller and Joe Jackson. In all, over 100 acts were scheduled to perform on seven stages over the weekend.

Her voice was pristine, sounding every bit as good as back in her commercial heyday of the early 2000s, and she said she was thrilled to finally make it to the festival. \n\"I'm going to hang out all weekend and hear all kinds of different music,\" she told the fans. \"I am so excited.\" \nWomack used the opportunity to showcase her fantastic new album, \"The Way I'm Livin'\" (2014). Yet, she also touched upon her older efforts, opening the show with a memorable version of \"Never Again, Again,\" her debut single from 1997. Unfortunately, she didn't include her best-known song, Grammy-winner \"I Hope You Dance\" (2000). \nWith Womack winding down on one stage, Sister Sparrow and the Dirty Birds were flying high on another. The bluesy Brooklyn soul-rock act, led by Arleigh Kincheloe (aka, Sister Sparrow), was a big hit with the crowd members, most of whom probably didn't know anything about Sister Sparrow before the concert. That result didn't surprise me in the slightest -- I saw the same thing happen when Sister Sparrow performed in May at the BottleRock Napa music festival. \nIt was also good to see Wilson-Piper, who is best known for his work in The Church, authors of the modern-rock heirloom \"Under the Milky Way\" (1988). It was even better to catch a bit of the Mavericks, especially since my allotment included the neo-traditional country act's moving take on Neil Young's \"Harvest Moon.\" \nThere was so much going on later in the day, I needed to split my time between a number of different stages, so I could catch a little bit of T Bone Burnett (who sounded great), Michael Franti and Spearhead (ditto) and Big Star's Third. \nThere was a definite buzz around Big Star's Third, which was an all-star tribute to power-pop act Big Star's beloved \"3rd\" album (also known as \"Sister Lovers\"). It was an ambitious project, featuring Big Star's own Jody Stephens and other rockers performing with a chamber orchestra featuring Kronos Quartet and conducted by Van Dyke Parks. Yet, the crew pulled it off fairly well. Plus, it was just cool to see and hear Mike Mills, who, of course, hails from the greatest American rock band of all time -- R.E.M. \nThe festival continues through Sunday, offering such recommended acts as legendary gospel troupe Blind Boys of Alabama, Oakland R&B-soul vocalist Fantastic Negrito and singer-songwriter Neko Case. \nFollow Jim Harrington at http://twitter.com/jimthecritic and www.facebook.com/jim.bayareanews .
