A source told PEOPLE, \"Tom approves of Max and is totally, totally fine with it.\" Despite a report which previously claimed that Tom's absence at his daughter's wedding was because Max is a non scientologist, some sources said Tom and Max had a very good relationship. Max and Bella spent Thanksgiving and Christmas together with the actor. The \" Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation \" actor is happy with his daughter's marriage. As previously reported, Tom covered the bill for the couple's nuptials and party which took place at the fancy schmancy Dorchester hotel though he wasn't invited. Of why the 53-year-old wasn't invited, multiple sources explained that Bella and her now-husband Max wanted a super small wedding with a small group of friends only. Therefore, the newlyweds didn't invite their parents. Regarding their decision to make the nuptials low-key and private, Tom was reportedly cool with it. Bella and Max tied the knot at the Dorchester hotel in London's exclusive Mayfair district near Hyde Park on September 18. Bella reportedly chose four close friends to serve as bridesmaids. In a photo obtained by Woman's Day magazine, the bridesmaids wore soft pink jumpsuits as they flanked the smiling bride. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T05:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:56:34.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
