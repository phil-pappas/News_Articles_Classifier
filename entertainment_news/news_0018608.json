He remains in a coma, while his estranged wife Khloe Kardashian has flown to be by his side. \nShe has been making medical decisions on behalf of the embattled sportsman after it was revealed their divorce had not actually been finalised over the summer, as previously reported. Their split is expected to be made official by the end of 2015, over two years after Khloe moved to end their four-year marriage. \nDisick previously endured a brief stint at a treatment facility in Costa Rica in March.
