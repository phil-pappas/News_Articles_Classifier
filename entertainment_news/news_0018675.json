Autumnwatch returns to BBC Two and it's all live Red deer and badgers and geese, oh my! Autumnwatch returns to BBC Two and it's all live \nPress Association 2014 / / National Entertainment News Share \nAutumnwatch is back on BBC Two this November, with Chris Packham, Michaela Strachan and Martin Hughes-Games reporting live from the west coast of Scotland. \nAcross four days from Monday November 2, viewers will be treated to the very best of the season’s wild action. Activity will also be streamed live on the web and on BBC Red Button during the day, offering a truly multi-platform experience. Michaela Strachan (BBC) \nThe series will examine what makes this year different from other autumns. It will also analyse weather conditions across the country and ask how this year’s unsettled summer has affected our autumn wildlife. \nFor the first time, Autumnwatch is setting up home at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust’s Centre in Caerlaverock, Dumfries and Galloway. \nSituated on the Solway Firth, the centre is the overwintering home for a huge range of wildfowl and wetland birds, including the entire population of Svalbard barnacle geese and hundreds of whooper swans, who will have made the journey all the way from Iceland. \n— BBC Springwatch (@BBCSpringwatch) October 13, 2015 \nCaerlaverock was once a working farm, but has developed into a 1500-acre reserve including farmland, saltmarsh and freshwater wetland habitats. The area is home to a wide range of different creatures. \nRemote cameras in a number of key habitats will include Badger Cam, situated by a badger feeding area to watch their nightly activities. In conjunction with the University of Brighton, the team plan to test Brighton badgers and the badgers of Caerlaverock to discover whether urban badgers have more of a preference for anthropogenic (human) food than their rural cousins. \nIn addition, Underwater Camera will try to capture otters swimming under the water. \nThe nearby market town of Dumfries is also home to a wealth of urban wildlife. Highlights will include the daily routines of barnacle geese as they settle in for the winter. There will also be whooper swans flying in from Iceland, one of the longest sea crossings any swan makes. \nFrom rutting red deer to migrating geese and swans, Autumnwatch will showcase the beauty and drama of this changing season.
