PUBLISHED: 10:45, Thu, Oct 8, 2015 | UPDATED: 12:36, Thu, Oct 8, 2015 SG The end? Daniel Craig as James Bond \nThe latest Bond film isn't even out but everyone wants to know if Idris Elba, Tom Hardy or Damian Lewis will take over. \nDaniel Craig is typically blunt on the subject. \n\"Look, I don’t give a f**k. Good luck to them,\" he says. Related articles Double Oh-M-G: Daniel Craig is EATING Monica Bellucci's face in... \nWhile he is adamant that he has no right to give an opinion of any future Bonds or how they play the role, he has one basic instruction: \"Don't be sh**.\" \n\"You’ve got to step up. People do not make movies like this any more. This is really rare now. So don’t be sh**.\" \nHe may not be in such a hurry to leave after the latest projections for his SPECTRE wages were leaked. SG Daniel Craig's comments are as incendiary as the film, itself SG Death-defying stunts in Spectre James Bond wants to f**k anything with a pulse in SPECTRE The challenge is making the female characters as strong as possible Daniel Craig \nAccording to the Sun a source close to MGM said: \"Daniel's deal means he'll bank $24million (£15.66m) for acting, around $6million (£3.82m) for endorsements and $30million (£19.58m) if the financial projections are on course.\" \nThe actor is currently insisting that there have been no negotiations about him making a sequel to Spectre. \n\"I'm not in discussion with anybody about anything,\" he said in a recent interview. \n\"If I did another Bond movie, it would only be for the money.\" SG Daniel Craig kisses Monica Bellucci in SPECTRE Related articles 'New James Bond will NOT be black' Pierce Brosnan destroys Idris... \nHe is equally upfront with his views on 007's womanising in the new interview with Time Out magazine. \nThe latest clip from SPECTRE sees Craig passionately kissing Monica Bellucci , but Bond's relationships with women are rarely very healthy. \n\"I think you have to walk a thin line. I think it’s okay for him – not to be misogynistic, that’s too strong a word – to find women a little difficult, shall we say?\" Craig says. \n\"Bond still wants to have sex. I still think he wants to f**k anything with a pulse.\" \nCraig believes that the challenge is making the female characters his equal. \n\"It’s about how the women change him. That, for me, is interesting.\" \n\"What you do is, you do your best to make the parts for the women in the movie as strong and as interesting as possible. \n\"Otherwise, I’m like, 'forget it.'\" \nThe 47-year-old is also upfront about his own role as a sex symbol. \n\"Am I getting my kit off in this movie? Yes, I’ve been working out for six months. Of course I’m getting my kit off.\" \nHe also drily acknowledged the impact of the iconic moment he emerged from the sea in Casino Royale, clad only in skimpy blue trunks. \n\"That was a big accident, that particular shot,\" he says. \n\"I was pretending to be cool by swimming, I thought it looked stupid and stood up and I walked off – and that was the shot.\" \nSPECTRE is out in cinemas on October 26.
