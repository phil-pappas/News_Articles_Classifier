Speakers at the protest said they want to bring justice for those who were killed by police. \nACADEMY Award-winning filmmaker Quentin Tarantino joined hundreds of demonstrators waving signs, shouting through megaphones and marching along the city’s streets on Saturday to protest police brutality. \nThe protest came at a time of heightened awareness across America of the oft-contentious relationship between police officers and the people they serve. New York’s mayor and police commissioner have said they’re serious about enacting smart reforms to build trust between police and communities. \n“I’m a human being with a conscience,” said Tarantino, who flew in from California for the event. “And if you believe there’s murder going on then you need to rise up and stand up against it. I’m here to say I’m on the side of the murdered.” \nThe group gathered Saturday in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village neighbourhood at Washington Square Park before marching about three kilometres along Sixth Avenue. The protesters walked past lines of police officers who had cordoned off a lane of traffic for them. As they moved, those with megaphones shouted stories of the slain as others waved signs with photos of the dead, mostly young black men, and the dates and places of their deaths. Quentin Tarantino attends a rally to denounce police brutality in Washington Square Park October 24, 2015 in New York City. \nThe event was the last of three demonstrations the group RiseUpOctober organised in New York this week. Speakers at the protest said they want to bring justice for people killed by police. \nTemako Williams walked arm in arm with academic and activist Cornel West, one of the organisers. Her son, La-Reko Williams, was killed by police in 2011 in Charlotte, North Carolina. A federal jury ruled that a Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officer, who did not face criminal charges, had used excessive force, and it awarded her $500,000.
