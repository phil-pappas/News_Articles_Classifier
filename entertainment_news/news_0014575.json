Real Housewives of Orange County star Tamra Judge's feud with her estranged daughter Sidney just reached a whole new level of awfulness. The teen ripped her mom to shreds in a Facebook post this week, after Tamra commented on their relationship on a reunion show earlier this week. \nSidney has been living with her dad, Simon Barney, for the past two years, and has used social media before to ask her mother to please stop talking about their family dynamics on TV. \nThis time, Sidney didn't hold back, and accused Tamra of being \"embarrassing\" and \"mentally.verbally abusive.\" She wrote, \"I watched the reunion show last night and I am disappointed ... I try not to talk about personal family matters with my friends, but I was made aware that my mother was talking about me and discussing our personal family matters on the show again. At this point I think it is necessary to tell the truth since she does not know how to tell the truth.\" \nMore from The Stir : 'RHOC' Tamra Barney Attacked by the Last Person Youâ€™d Expect \nShe went on to say that her mother used her and her siblings for \"story lines,\" instead of being a real mom to them, and that she continually puts the show ahead of everything in her life, including her children. \nJudge told Andy Cohen on the reunion show that she had offered to go to counseling with Sidney, and try to work things out. She said that she was blindsided two years ago when Sid walked out and went to live with her dad. \nJudge and Barney were married for 11 years before splitting in 2010. They also share two other daughters, Spencer and Sophia. \nUpon hearing that her mom had tried to fix things back when she finally walked out, Sidney said, \"If she really wanted me back in her life, she would have taken responsibility and changed two years ago when I told [her] the first time what was causing our relationship to suffer ... Obviously, I am just another story line that feeds her fame and her wallet.\" \nWhat a crappy situation! It's hard to know exactly what's going on behind closed doors, but it's obvious that Tamra isn't doing anyone any favors by throwing her teenage daughter under the bus on national TV. Just let it go, and stop blaming the teenager for your broken relationship, Tamra! \nEven if it is her fault, there's no reason to talk about her at all in public. Just say, \"That's a family matter, thank you for respecting our privacy.\" The end. But then again, this is Real Housewives we're talking about.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:57:00.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
