Testimony at his April 2013 trial showed that Scott and the victim were watching television when, without being provoked, Johnson shot Alston four times in the back of the head with a .38 caliber firearm without exchanging a word.\nJohnson then walked into the front yard and awaited his mother’s arrival from work. Johnson explained the incident to his mother, who called 911.\nIn a unanimous ruling, the Supreme Court rejected Scott’s argument that the trial judge erred by not instructing the jury on a lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter because the judge ruled the victim’s behavior was insufficient to justify the charge.\n“We agree,” the court ruled. “Under the circumstances, Johnson’s response to the provoking incident was objectively unreasonable, and nothing in the evidence required a charge on voluntary manslaughter.”", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-19T16:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:04:48.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
