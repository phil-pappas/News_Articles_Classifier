You can almost hear the drum beat . . . \"\nOCTOBER 23, 2015\nScottsdale, AZ - Upcoming \"WEST OF WAKEFIELD Carved in Wood\" show and sale is celebrating a lively list of head-turning MASTERPIECES by the late woodcarving genius, Cecil Wakefield (1930-2003) at Dennis June Gallery on Main Street.\nWith hundreds of high level award credits to his name, Wakefield enjoyed decades of international acclaim for the realism of his wood carvings. Cecil enthusiastically shared his limelight with peers, organizing carver clubs and public exhibitions on a lifelong basis. But no one could carve in wood like Wakefield. The proof is in his many magazine covers, national awards, one-man gallery shows, and respect from colleagues who similarly \"carve in wood.\"\nForty five years ago, Scottsdale's notable art district dealers and collectors converged to set Wakefield on a path to artistic fame. Dealers learned early-on that Wakefield's prices were fair and attractive, but firm. Those who disagreed never saw him again. He had a religion to serve and a family to feed. His bread-and-butter caricatures were in continual demand, while collectors far and wide clamored for his high priced \"realistic\" models. To satisfy that demand, Cecil decided to cement his legacy with a time-consuming series of realistic carvings cast in bronze. Dennis June Gallery will offer a handful of these scarce bronzes AND their original wood carved models in the upcoming \"WEST OF WAKEFIELD Carved in Wood\" exhibit and sale.\nOver fifty original western caricatures, bronzes and \"realistic\" woodcarvings will be gathered for the show. It fulfills a life-long dream of Cecil's son, Bob Wakefield, himself a Master woodcarver. Bob will demonstrate his father's techniques during the exhibit opening at Scottsdale's famed 43rd annual Thursday Night Artwalk. Bob Wakefield is understandably excited to see his father's art work continue to excel in the gallery world. \"Dad was always dedicated to his church and his carving,\" Bob says, \"and he luckily passed those traits on to me. He deserves this.\" A small number of Bob's carvings will also be available.\nThe ten-week show will open at Dennis June Gallery, 7056 E Main St, Scottsdale, November 12th, 7-9 pm. The Thursday night Artwalk opening will offer wine and refreshments, so show up early to see how one man's carving genius transformed blocks of wood into a realism equaled by no other.\nAs one observer remarked, \"Wakefield's carvings look like they can dance, you can almost hear the drum beat . . . \"\nAbout Cecil Wakefield: amassed more ribbons and awards than he could count. Being an eminently humble fellow, most have not seen the light of day. In his twilight years, Wakefield donated his time and expertise encouraging peers and youngsters to follow in his broad, deep footsteps. Teaching and judging rounded out a life-long career that pushed Wakefield to the top of the wood carver's world, an honor his colleagues happily acknowledge to this day. \"Few will ever match the realism of carvings by Cecil Wakefield,\" dealers and collectors agree still, a full decade after his passing.\nContact: Dennis June, 480-500-1000, This email address is being protected from spambots.
