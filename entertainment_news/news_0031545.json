They ain't going to throw 5,000 people out.\"This instantly rubs Cowell up the wrong way, as he says: \"What gives you the right to say that?\" © ITV / Thames/Syco/Fremantle Media \"I'll go for it straight,\" Mason replies. \"The first auditions - I watched on Saturday. People had ten minute slots and I went to 47 seconds.\"While Rita Ora and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini look shocked - and some of the Boys who have already won seats swivel them round to face away from Mason - Cowell warns: \"You are five seconds away from getting thrown off this stage... If you've got a problem, then just go.\"As Mason claims that he is \"being an artist\" and the crowd begins to boo, Olly Murs notes (perhaps not entirely necessarily): \"This is going horribly wrong.\" © ITV / Thames/Syco/Fremantle Media Mason insists that he is doing this for \"entertainment\" and \"art\" but he's completely run down Cowell's patience and the judge complains: \"You are being a complete arsehole. Don't tell me how long you should have on this show.\"After repeatedly telling Mason to \"shut up\", Cowell adds: \"Why don't you first of all apologise to these guys over there who spent hours editing your tapes? Don't come on and insult my show and insult these producers.\"But Mason refuses to apologise - and even gets compared to Kanye West by Ora.\"Yeah, well you're not Kanye West yet,\" Grimshaw comments. \"So chill your boots.\"The full clash will air in tonight's show, which kicks off at 7pm on ITV.
