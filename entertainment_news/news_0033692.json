Philip Leitman, co-founder and president of NTM Info and Research, will also discuss Fern Leitman’s long-term battle with NTM lung disease. NTM Info and Research is a non-profit organization formed on behalf of patients with NTM lung disease. \nLifetime will air the program at 7:30 AM ET/PT on October 20 and 27. Replays are accessible via www.NTMfacts.com and www.thebalancingact.com . \nThe series is produced with the aim of uniting patients, physicians, and scientists with research and education to help advance the way the health care system works for those who are diagnosed with rare diseases. \nInsmed has partnered with “The Balancing Act” to develop the program and provide answers to important questions, such as: What is NTM lung disease? What are the symptoms of NTM lung disease? Why is early diagnosis and monitoring of NTM lung disease important? About Nontuberculous Mycobacteria Lung Disease \nNontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) lung disease is a rare and often chronic condition that is capable of causing irreversible lung damage and can be fatal when untreated. The symptoms of NTM lung disease are variable; however, virtually all patients have chronic or recurring cough. Other symptoms include sputum production, shortness of breath, and chest pain. As NTM lung disease advances, systemic side effects, such as fatigue, malaise, and weight loss may become increasingly prevalent. NTM lung disease is caused by organisms commonly found in water or soil and it can be difficult to diagnose as its symptoms are similar to other co-existing lung diseases, like bronchiectasis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, and pneumoconiosis. \nThere are currently no products indicated for the treatment of NTM lung disease in North America or Europe. Current approaches usually involve prolonged treatment with multi-drug regimens that are poorly tolerated with limited effectiveness, especially in patients with severe disease or in those patients with disease that is refractory to treatment. \nAccording to a company-sponsored patient chart study, approximately 50,000 patients suffering from NTM lung disease visited physician offices in the United States during 2011. A publication from the National Institutes of Health based on United States Medicare data from 1997-2007 determined that the annual prevalence of patients infected with PNTM in the United States increased 8.2% per year from 20 cases/100,000 to 47 cases/100,000 in people over 65. A 2015 publication from co-authors from several US government departments stated that prior year statistics led to a projected 181,037 national annual cases in 2014 costing the US healthcare system approximately $1.7 billion. \nAbout Insmed \nInsmed Incorporated is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the needs of patients battling serious rare diseases of high unmet medical need.
