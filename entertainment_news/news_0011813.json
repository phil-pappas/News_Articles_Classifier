Check out our Movie Week best moments Strictly Come Dancing 2015: Lights, camera, action! Check out our Movie Week best moments \nPress Association 2014 / / National Entertainment News Share \nThe stars of Strictly Come Dancing 2015 are gearing up for Movie Week, with Ainsley Harriott climbing into a penguin suit for his Happy Feet dance and Peter Andre polishing his best Johnny Depp impersonation as he prepares to Paso Doble to He’s A Pirate. \nThe BBC One show’s Hollywood-themed weeks always feature some of the best costumes and most inventive dances of the series. Here’s our favourites from previous seasons… Scott Mills as the Little Mermaid crab Sebastian with Joanne Clifton Scott Mills and Joanne Clifton (Guy Levy/BBC) \nHave you ever seen a more determined – or a less coordinated – crab? The Radio 1 DJ proved he could laugh at himself as he took on Under The Sea, with Joanne as his Little Mermaid. \nHe left the judges almost speechless, though Craig describe the whole look as “lobster on acid”. Frankie Bridge and her West Side Story-themed Paso Doble with Kevin Clifton Frankie Bridge and Kevin Clifton (Guy Levy/BBC) \nWith this beautiful, meticulous dance, Frankie and Kevin topped the leaderboard and earned the first “10″ of 2014 – though it was a “Donny 10″ from guest judge Donny Osmond. \n“Frankie goes to Hollywood and gives us a blockbuster,” head judge Len proclaimed. Promoted stories Natalie Gumede and Artem Chigvintsev’s American Smooth to Dreamgirls’ I Am Telling You I’m Not Going Natalie Gumede and Artem Chigvinstev (Guy Levy/BBC) \nOK, maybe 2013 featured a Musicals Week instead of Movie Week – but it basically still counts. \nThis was the song Natalie and Artem chose to perform again in the final, where it got a perfect 40, with Darcey saying: “You can see how much you love that dance. It was intense. It is perfection.” Bruno added: “That’s the best dance across both the UK and US that I’ve seen.” Mark Benton and Iveta Lukosiute Samba to I Just Can’t Wait To Be King from The Lion King Iveta Lukosiute and Mark Benton (Guy Levy/BBC) \nThe actor went out on a high, with a fun-filled version of the Samba – in a perfect lion costume. \nIt landed them in the dance-off, but at least that meant we got to see the dance twice. Louis Smith and Flavia Cacace Salsa to The Time Of My Life from Dirty Dancing Flavia Cacace and Louis Smith (Guy Levy/BBC) \nEveryone knows THAT Dirty Dancing lift – the run, the leap into the air, Patrick Swayze holding Baby effortlessly over his head. \nLuckily, Olympic gymnast Louis had the strength to hold Flavia aloft. Covering such a classic dance was a risk – but it paid off. Denise van Outen and James Jordan Foxtrot to You’ve Got A Friend In Me from Toy Story James Jordan and Denise Van Outen (Guy Levy/BBC) \nThis dance won the highest score of the evening in 2012′s Movie Week. Darcey called them an “elegant couple” and Craig called it “beautifully danced and postured”. \nDenise started out a lifeless toy – before James climbed out of the toy-box as cowboy Woody and brought her to life for a turn on the dance floor. Patrick Robinson and Anya Garnis’s Charleston to Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Patrick Robinson (Guy Levy/BBC) \nYou know it’s going to be good dance when someone arrives on stage in a flying car. \nThe dance received three 10s and an eight – guess which grumpy judge gave the eight? Bruno said: “Talk about va va voom! You won it!” Chelsee Healey and Pasha Kovalev’s Shrek Jive Chelsee Healey and Pasha Kovalev (Guy Levy/BBC) \nChelsee and Pasha danced to I’m A Believer from the Shrek soundtrack – and poor Pasha had to spend quite a lot of time in the make-up department, judging by his costume. \nThey stormed to the top of the leader board with an almost-perfect Jive, scoring 39. \nWhat classics will 2015 bring?
