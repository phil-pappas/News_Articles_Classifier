The show is slated for fall 2016 and additional casting will be announced later.\nLike Hamlet and Macbeth, Othello is a Shakespearean protagonist driven mad by suspicion and fear. In the play, Othello's trusted lieutenant spins a web to make him doubt his wife's fidelity.\nCraig plays James Bond in \"Spectre\" out next month and Oyelowo is next slated to co-star with Zoe Saldana in \"Nina\" about singer Nina Simone.\n___\nOnline: http://www.nytw.org\nArts & Entertainment Celebrities Daniel Craig David Oyelowo William Shakespeare", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:53:07.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
