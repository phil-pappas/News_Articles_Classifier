Per Miller Kaplan reporting, which excludes barter revenues and syndication revenues, Emmis' second quarter radio revenues were down 0.5% compared to local radio market revenues down 1.9%. Our New York cluster performed much better in the second quarter (up 4.3% in a market down 3.4%).\nEmmis' Publishing division had another solid quarter, with revenues up 3.4%, and up 4.6% year to date. Texas Monthly has demonstrated particularly strong growth in the first half of the year.\nEmmis grew station operating income for the second fiscal quarter to $15.3 million , compared to $15.2 million for the same quarter of the prior year. For the second fiscal quarter, operating income was $9.8 million , compared to $12.5 million for the same quarter of the prior year. This decline is nearly entirely attributable to a $2.5 million nonrecurring gain on contract settlement in the prior year.\n\"Despite our outperformance, the markets where we operate remain challenged. While we are outperforming in a difficult marketplace, the radio industry is clearly in need of a catalyst – and we think we have it with NextRadio,\" Jeff Smulyan , CEO of Emmis said. \"The addition of AT&T and T-Mobile during the quarter continues the momentum for NextRadio, the Emmis-led industry initiative to make FM broadcast radio available on smartphones and tablets. I'm most pleased by the broad industry support we have garnered for the effort, which we believe will revolutionize radio.\"\nA conference call regarding earnings will be hosted today at 9 a.m. Eastern by dialing 1-517-623-4891. Questions may be submitted via email to ir@emmis.com . A replay of the call will be available until 6 p.m. on Thursday, October 22 by dialing 203-369-3253.\nEmmis has included supplemental station operating expenses and certain other financial data on its website, www.emmis.com under the \"Investors\" tab.\nEmmis generally evaluates the performance of its operating entities based on station operating income. Management believes that station operating income is useful to investors because it provides a meaningful comparison of operating performance between companies in the industry and serves as an indicator of the market value of a group of stations or publishing entities. Station operating income is generally recognized by the broadcast and publishing industries as a measure of performance and is used by analysts who report on the performance of broadcasting and publishing groups. Station operating income does not take into account Emmis' debt service requirements and other commitments, and, accordingly, station operating income is not necessarily indicative of amounts that may be available for dividends, reinvestment in Emmis' business or other discretionary uses.\nStation operating income is not a measure of liquidity or of performance, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States , and should be viewed as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, our results of operations presented on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States . Operating Income is the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nMoreover, station operating income is not a standardized measure and may be calculated in a number of ways. Emmis defines station operating income as revenues net of agency commissions and station operating expenses, excluding depreciation, amortization and non-cash compensation. A reconciliation of station operating income to operating income is attached to this press release.\nThe information in this news release is being widely disseminated in accordance with the Securities & Exchange Commission's Regulation FD.\nEmmis Communications – Great Media, Great People, Great Service ®\nAbout Emmis Communications\nEmmis Communications Corporation is a diversified media company, principally focused on radio broadcasting.
