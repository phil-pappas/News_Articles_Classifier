The clock would be Mr. T's head and the mohawk would be the snooze button. Bill, a skinny Jewish guy with a deep baritone voice that would soon lead jazz bands and run radio shows suddenly shouted, \"WAKE UP, FOOL! YOU'RE SLEEPIN' YO' LIFE AWAY!\" (I know, I know, now you want one too.) \nWhile enjoying round three of napping Sunday, I thought about that alarm clock, and the various things Bill would periodically shout in Mr. T's voice to rouse a sleeper from bed. Fritz \nFor years, in part because I often work six days a week, I've spent Sundays in my home, in my pajamas, napping, watching shows and essentially being quiet and still. I probably got it from Walter Sobchak, who's \"told those fucks down at the league office a thousand times I don't roll on Shabbos!\" \nWhat's Shabbos? \n\"Saturday, Donny, is Shabbos, the Jewish day of rest. That means that I don't work, I don't get in a car, I don't ride in a car, I don't pick up the phone, I don't turn on the oven, and I sure as shit don't fucking roll! SHOMER SHABBOS!\" \nI do my version of Shabbos on Sunday, but the rest of Walter's rules apply. Advertisement \nLately though, I've been shifting the non-activity more towards sleeping. It's gotten to the point where my cat is actually awake more than I am, eyeing me with either jealousy or judgement when I shuffle to the kitchen for a glass of water and then straight back to bed. \nI know what's going on here: Sleeping is awesome, the rest of the week I can't seem to get eight hours in, and Sundays I'm making up some of that missed bed time. But also, I'm depressed, and when I'm awake and don't have much to do, my mind drifts towards my mother's cancer, the finality of death and wondering what the point of anything is. My aunt refers to this as \"The Dark Night of the Soul\" â€” I guess on some level I'm figuring if it's a dark night, it's a fine time to sleep. \nI'm not worried about being in this place. I've been here before a few times and re-emerged into the light with a fresh smile and a lust for life. Feeling out of sorts right now is wholly appropriate. Given the things that have gone down over the past six months, it'd be weird if I wasn't profoundly affected, asking questions the universe isn't answering and always wanting a nap. Still, I'm glad I've found a new therapist. Therapists are sherpas, guiding a person through a journey more quickly than one could manage alone. \nBut Bill's imaginary Mr. T alarm clock is right: I'm sleeping my life away. Even if I don't know what the answers are to the big questions I've been asking, I'm probably not going to get them while asleep. \nRead more Fritz: coloradodaily.com/columnists .
