In its first professional staging in 25 years, Brazilian playwright Roberto Athayde’s dark comedy—initially banned in Brazil (for “illicit” content) and mounted on Broadway in 1977 and 1990—is technically a two-character piece with the dictatorial title teacher and a male student. \nHowever, theatergoers should be prepared to get pulled into the action as the “student” often sits among an audience that is treated like a class of naughty, unruly eighth graders by the tyrannical Miss Margarida (portrayed by local actress Annette Houlihan Verdolino). There’s even a blackboard onstage for anyone to draw and write whatever they wish. \nDescribed by one critic as “part tirade, part political allegory, part expressionist vaudeville show,” the satire has been hailed as a statement on the notion of power—in government, church, family, one’s peers and any other form—as Miss Margarida uses charm, intimidation and manipulation to exert control and impose her will. \nBy the time class is dismissed, audiences will have been comically schooled in a witty, interactive lesson by a force-of-nature teacher and her dirty looks. \nThe Smith Center for the Performing Arts, 7 p.m. Oct. 22-23, 2:30 & 7 p.m. Oct. 24, 2:30 p.m. Oct. 25, $39 plus tax and fee. 702.749.2000 More to Read", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:17:03.144+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
