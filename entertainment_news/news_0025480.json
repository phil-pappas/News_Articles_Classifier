And when I say “huge check,” I mean it in two ways.\nFor starters, it was physically very large. But it also was made out to the tune of $12,500, which is also huge. The presentation was made last Wednesday, October 7, at a dinner held at Proietti’s Restaurant.\nThe Rochester “Challenger” Miracle Field is an adaptive sports field to be built in Webster for special needs individuals and Wounded Warriors. There are 10,000 special needs individuals in the Rochester area that will be able to utilize the Miracle Field.\nDespite the rainy weather on Saturday many individuals braved the elements and attended the Festival. The weather improved a abit on Sunday, and the crowds came out to enjoy the festival. The Garlic Festival featured all-day entertainment by local bands as well as a variety of food trucks, garlic vendors, craft and specialty vendors. Food demos and lectures and discussions on growing garlic proved popular with many of the attendees.\nThe Webster Garlic Festival Association board members are already planning the 2016 festival. To find out more, click on www.webstergarlicfestival.com or go on Facebook and friend Webster Garlic Festival.\nCongratulations to the festival organizers — the Webster Rotary, Webster Lions and Webster Kiwanis clubs — for a fantastic event and to everyone who braved the elements to attend. I’m already looking forward to next year.\n* * *\nemail me at missyblog@gmail.com\n“Like” this blog on Facebook and follow me on Twitter", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/dluMG1", "https://twitter.com/Missyblog", "http://www.webstergarlicfestival.com/"], "published": "2015-10-13T05:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:04:40.980+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
