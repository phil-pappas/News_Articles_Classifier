Infants not allowed.\nInformation : 909-477-2752, lewisfamilyplayhouse.com .\nA beloved children’s book series is getting star treatment in Rancho Cucamonga this weekend.\nThe “Elephant and Piggie” book series, written by Mo Willems will come to life with “Elephant & Piggie’s ‘We Are in a Play!’” at the Lewis Family Playhouse over the next two weekends.\nMainStreet Theatre Company, which specializes in family-friendly productions and is one of the resident groups at the venue, is behind the musical’s California debut.\nThe touring show will have a special guest, Deborah Wicks La Puma, who not only wrote the music for the show, which also ran at the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C., but is also serving as the musical director and playing piano with the band at every performance.\n“We are so lucky to have her here,” MainStreet Theatre Company producer Murry Hepner said.\nShe said the play is an adaptation of five of the early reader books and that the theater troupe mirrored their style with the show’s production -- simple and minimalist. The book illustrations are crafted in a comic book style.\n“There is not a lot of busy set design,” Hepner said. “The costumes are black and white with bright accessories.”\nThroughout the hour-long performance the zany characters -- including Gerald the Elephant and Piggie the pig -- realize they are in a play.\nThe series is geared towards children who are learning to read and Hepner recommended the show for audience members who are at least 4 years old.\nContact the writer: sschulte@pe.com , 951-368-9457", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw8lsw-b88539158z.120151014180520000gj2civvd.10.jpg", "http://www.lewisfamilyplayhouse.com/", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw8lsw-b88539158z.120151014180520000gj2civvd.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:31:17.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
