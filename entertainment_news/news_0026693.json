To celebrate The FADER 's 100th issue, we have decided to make our entire archive of print issues available for a free download. We want our readers to continue to enjoy and experience The FADER through a broad array of mediums: web, mobile, video, events and print, and we will continue to create new ways to connect our audience with more award-winning content. \"\nTo download the bundle, users need to first visit The FADER 100 Bundle homepage , and click download.

Through this partnership with BitTorrent, we ' re giving longtime readers the chance to finally complete their collection of The FADER , and new readers will get an opportunity to see where the publication began. Looking back, it ' s incredible to see that, as much as the magazine has grown and evolved, the core mission has remained the same: to reveal what ' s next in music and culture, and to celebrate the lifestyle around it all. \"\nAs this announcement champions The FADER's print edition, it arrives alongside The FADER's largest digital growth in history, with exponential increases in online and mobile traffic, as well as content production and experiential events.
