He is the older brother of actor Dennis Quaid. \nIt was not immediately clear why the arrest warrants were issued, but Quaid recently said they were related to a longstanding dispute over a property in Santa Barbara. Quaid and his wife were arrested in California in 2010 on suspicion of burglary and entering a building without consent. \nQuaid said the building was their own home and that after a failed attempt to sell it, they still owned the property. \nAn attorney representing Quaid could not be reached for immediate comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T18:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:03:50.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
