Anderson Cooper is the moderator. Juan Carlos Lopez and Dana Bash will ask questions, while Don Lemon chooses questions submitted through Facebook.\n\"You want someone at the debate for Tuesday night who will question the Democrats from the progressive perspective,\" said Jeff Cohen, a former MSNBC producer who now teaches at Ithaca College, and the petition's author.\nSuch a journalist, from outlets like Mother Jones, The Nation or Democracy Now, could raise a topic that a more mainstream moderator might miss that's important to the left wing base, he said.\nHewitt was on stage to ask questions when CNN televised the GOP debate last month because of a co-sponsoring agreement with the Salem Media Group, which distributes the conservative commentator's talk show. Salem owns 112 radio stations and websites like townhall.com, and focuses on content promoting Christian and conservative values.\nHillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Jim Webb, Martin O'Malley and Lincoln Chafee will all participate in the CNN debate. CNN has said it would make room for Vice President Joe Biden if he were to decide to run as late as the day of the debate.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
