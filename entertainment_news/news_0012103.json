Tyler’s efforts come at a pivotal time for songwriters in America as 75% of their income is heavily regulated by the government through the consent decrees enacted over ASCAP and BMI by the Department of Justice and other unnecessary government regulations.\nSONA was co-founded by Michelle Lewis (Cher, Little Mix, currently a full-time composer for Disney) and Kay Hanley (founding member of Letters to Cleo, currently a full-time composer for Disney). Other prominent members include Kara DioGuardi (Pink, Jason Derulo, Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood), Anne Preven (Katy Perry, Beyoncé, Miley Cyrus, Madonna), Claudia Brant (Latin GRAMMY Award winner, three-time SESAC Latina Songwriter of the Year, songs for Il Divo, Ricky Martin, Santana, Paulina Rubio), Victoria Horn (Katy Perry, Selena Gomez, Demi Lovato, Enrique Iglesias), Lindy Robbins (Jason Derulo, Demi Lovato, Hot Chelle Rae), Shelly Peiken (Christina Aguilera, Meredith Brooks, Brandy), Pam Sheyne (Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson, Corinne Bailey Rae), Danielle Brisebois (Natasha Bedingfield, member of New Radicals), Michael “Smidi” Smith (Miley Cyrus, Giorgio Moroder, Pussycat Dolls, Ke$ha), Jack Kugell (Martina McBride, Pussycat Dolls), and Andrew Rollins (composer for TV show “Nashville”).\n\"We would like to thank a fellow songwriter, Steven Tyler, for shining a light on issues affecting songwriters’ rights,” says Michelle Lewis, Executive Director of Songwriters of North America (SONA). “His cease and desist letter to Donald Trump was not a political issue, rather an issue of vital importance to us songwriters which is the use of our music in political campaigns. We do not have the right to approve these uses because of overbearing government regulations. We hope this momentum from Steven’s efforts is carried forward to the broader discussion about the consent decrees that govern ASCAP and BMI and other outdated laws that dictate how our music is to be used and how we are paid. We must create mutually beneficial solutions for both songwriters and the digital community so we can effectively co-exist and thrive in the new music business.”\nAdded David Israelite, President & CEO of the National Music Publishers’ Association (NMPA), “Steven Tyler is standing up for the rights of all American songwriters. Songs have value. And the use of those songs should be under the control of those who create them. It is only because of outdated consent decrees imposed during World War II that American songwriters don't have control of their songs. That needs to change.”\nAbout SONA:\nSongwriters of North America (SONA) is a legislative advocacy group founded by several high-profile songwriters to form a unified voice on legislative issues affecting their rights. At SONA’s first event in Los Angeles in April, over 100 songwriters gathered with creators’ rights advocate and SONA attorney advisor, Dina LaPolt, for a “Songwriter Summit” to discuss the consent decrees governing ASCAP and BMI and other important legislative issues like the Songwriter Equity Act, which is currently pending in Congress. SONA is rapidly growing in size as more songwriters hear their efforts in songwriter advocacy.
