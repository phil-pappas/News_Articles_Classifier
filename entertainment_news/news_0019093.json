I’m making up with myself,” the 27-year-old wrote. \n“Making up for lost time. Making up for everything I ever did and never did. But I haven’t got time to hold onto the crumbs of my past like I used to. What’s done is done.” \nAdele said she used to wish her years away, and wanted to be older. \n“When I turned 12 I just wanted to be 18. Then after that I stopped wanting to be older,” she wrote. \n“Now I’m ticking 16-24 boxes just to see if I can blag it! I feel like I’ve spent my whole life so far wishing it away. Always wishing I was older, wishing I was somewhere else… Wishing I hadn’t ruined so many good things because I was scared or bored…” Promoted stories \nThe London-born singer revealed celebrating her 25th birthday felt like a “turning point”. Bye bye 25… See you again later in the year x pic.twitter.com/HEmY14El5s \n— Adele (@Adele) May 4, 2014 \n“Teetering on the edge of being an old adolescent and a fully-fledged adult, I made the decision to go into becoming who I’m going to be forever without a removal van of my old junk,” she continued. \n“I miss everything about my past, the good and the bad, but only because it won’t come back. When I was in it, I wanted out! So typical. I’m on about being a teenager, sitting around and chatting s**t, not caring about the future because it didn’t matter then like it does now. \n“The ability to be flippant about everything and there be no consequences. Even following and breaking rules… is better than making the rules.” \nAdele also apologised to her fans for the delay in releasing 25, rumoured to be out in November. \nThe Brit and Grammy winner explained her reasons for postponing the upcoming studio record, referring to motherhood, writing: “And I’m sorry it took so long, but you know, life happened.” Share article \nThe singer became a mother in October 2012, when she gave birth to son Angelo with boyfriend Simon Konecki.
