Photo: Nic Walker \nOn the eve of the Australian leg of of his Let Me Entertain You tour, Robbie Williams has revealed a surprising new twist to his career.\nHe says next year he plans to take on a new challenge in TV – as an actor. \nIt has been widely rumoured that he would be hitting the small screen by joining Britain's  The X Factor – he's appearing on the Australian version while in Sydney – but he divulged it could be something completely different.\nGood spirits: Robbie Williams. Photo: Nic Walker \nSpeaking about what's on his horizon for next year, he said: \"I've got a few irons in the fire that aren't necessarily musical. Nothing solid yet but it would involve TV.\"\nAdvertisement When pressed, Williams said it would be a different path. \"Yeah, acting,\" he said, before adding \"I shouldn't have said anything because I can't say anything.\n\"I've got an idea for a TV show that I want to do. It may or may not happen – and at the moment it is happening and I'm excited about it.\"\nWilliams, 41, was in Sydney to launch his latest tour which he says is a return to his true pop-star form. When he graced Australian stages last year it was as a part of what he calls his \"other career\" – as a cabaret act charming his way through the relatively low-key Swings Both Ways tour.\nNow the jovial British entertainer is back to his pop roots after a self-imposed hiatus following his last mainstream world tour in 2006, which ended with him burnt-out and spending a stint in rehab.\n\"I decided that I was going to retire,\" he said of that time. But he adds, \"I didn't tell anybody because I knew that it was bollocks,\" meaning he knew he'd be back at some point. \nBut Williams emerged from hibernation to tour in 2011 with his reunited boy band Take That, the act with which he first made his name in the early 1990s  who have enjoyed a huge resurgence in their British homeland.\n\"I don't know if you prepare to come back,\" he says. \"It wasn't like riding a bike. I had to hit my stride over a few tours.\n\"I got to come back with Take That so I was sort of hiding in public. I hid as a member of Take That which gave me my confidence back to get back on stage. And after that it was just slowly, slowly and now I'm in my stride again. I'm in full-on pop star mode.\"\nWilliams says right now, he's feeling very good indeed about inhabiting the role of Mr Pop Star once again. \n\"It feels great to be less neurotic and worried and mental. I'm still crazy but my crazy isn't stopping me from getting on stage and doing my job and going out and following my passion.\"\nWilliams, 41, was in Sydney to launch his Let Me Entertain You tour, cutting a dapper figure in blue suit and matching blue studded loafers. He's been on the road since March across Europe and Asia, with the Australian leg starting in Perth on Friday followed by Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney.\nThe set list is a greatest hits round-up, having learnt his lesson on his previous visit when he performed his 2012 single Candy .\n\"I did the first show in Perth and Candy came on and there was just no response whatsoever,\" he said. \"I was like, this is so weird, my second biggest hit [overseas] after Angels , what happened?\n\"And then I went home and put in Google 'Robbie Williams, Australia, Candy' . Number 53. So I'll take that off the set list, then,\" he deadpanned.\nHis 1997 song Angels , the anthemic singalong classic, remains the song people most associate with Williams.\n\"It is my biggest hit and I'm really proud of it, which means I never get bored of singing it. But also it's the last song so it means that I'm going home.\n\"So I kind of really get a mental and physical breather. I know that I am ending on an emotional and hit-wise high. I never get bored of it. It's what gave me my career. \"\nRobbie Williams is at Perth Arena, October 9-10, Adelaide Entertainment Centre, October 13-14, Brisbane Entertainment Centre, October 17, Rod Laver Arena, Melbourne, October 22-24, and Allphones Arena, Sydney, October 27-28. \nSee ticketek.com.au.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T11:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T13:43:08.999+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
