The program consists of Schubert’s Piano Trio in One Movement in B-flat Major, D. 28; Schumann’s Three Fantasy Pieces for Horn and Piano, Opus 73; David Ludwig’s Three Yiddish Dances for Piano, Violin and Cello; Otto Ketting’s Intrada for Solo Horn; and Brahms’ Trio in E-flat Major for Piano, Horn and Violin, Opus 40. \nJoining music director/cellist Edward Arron will be pianist Anna Polonsky, violinist Bella Hristova and horn player Eric Ruske — a Masterworks lineup typical of the astounding roster of friends and musicians who have graced the Masterworks stage over the years. \nThe 2015-16 schedule also includes revered treasures from the repertoires of Bach, Mozart, Dvorák, Ravel and Bartók — as well as vital and stirring pieces by dynamic modern composers such as Arvo Pärt, David Ludwig, Otto Ketting, John Musto, Giovanni Sollima and Christopher O’Riley. \nAs always, there’s a delicate but clever overall thematic arc to the season’s six programs, and it’s definitely intentional. In fact, programming is something Arron’s enjoyed since his earliest days as a musician — a passion that blossomed in 2007, when he apprenticed with and then succeeded founding Masterworks music director Charles Wadsworth. \n“Yes, I like to have themes and sometimes they’re very apparent and sometimes they’re subtle and deeply below the surface,” says the always affable Arron. “I do try to avoid gimmicks. This year, I wanted to include a living composer for each event. It’s a big anniversary, so I love the idea of looking both forward and backward.” \nA notable exception to the “living composer” theme occurs Feb. 13 and 14. Instead of the typical arrangement, with the musicians repeating Saturday’s program during the Sunday matinee, Arron will shatter tradition in scintillating fashion. He and his longtime friend and frequent Masterworks performer Jeewon Park will perform the complete Beethoven cello/piano works — three sets of variations and five sonatas — an undertaking so vast it requires two different concerts to pull it off. \n“It’s the first time in the history of this series,” Arron says. “It’s seems like a celebratory thing to do for the silver anniversary. The mind often goes, in a situation like this, to a light, gale type of concert, and I’ve tried to go heavily in the other direction and bring something very different. It seems appropriate to try to shine a light on Beethoven’s entire career.” \nIt also seems appropriate to remember that, in 1990, when Jamie and Alden Murphy moved to Old Lyme from New York City, they so missed the musical opportunities of the Big Apple that, under the auspices of the Florence Griswold Museum, they staged a full-blown production of Gilbert & Sullivan’s “The Mikado.” Inspired by the success of three sold-out shows, and with the help of local friends John Hargraves and David Dangremond, the Murphys envisioned staging a casual series of concerts. Providentially, an esteemed accompanist at one of the early concerts was pianist Charles Wadsworth, who, in a casual post-performance note to Alden Murphy, suggested “doing a few more of these.” \nAnd when Wadsworth then came onboard as a creative director, the whole thing crystallized. Alden Murphy, now president of Musical Masterworks, laughs when she thinks about how things turned out. \n“Where we are and what we’ve accomplished far, far exceeds any expectations,” Alden Murphy says. “It’s almost embarrassing to admit we had no strategy — and maybe that’s why it worked. When Charles expressed interest, we thought, ‘A-ha! We have a hook!’ We knew there was a great cultural community in the area with wonderful museums, and we just reached out to friends who loved music.” \nMusical Masterworks also has been very active in the community. In 2004, they started an Outreach Program to expose kids to classical music through interactive, informal presentations. To date, more than 35,000 children in 20 schools have participated. \n“After we realized the series was viable, we wanted to give back to the community, and we thought the best way to do that is through the schools,” Murphy says. “We have a lot of great musicians at our fingertips and they’re happy to help. It’s amazing how children react when they see a musician play and they can envision themselves doing that — maybe something they’ve never considered.” \nIt’s just another aspect of the overall, alchemical Masterworks formula. And both Arron and Murphy are quick to point out a very important ingredient in the series’ success was landing the First Congregation Church as a venue. \n“That wasn’t an accident,” Murphy says. “It was pretty deliberate. We were members of the church and it has a central location and is perfectly sized for a chamber music concert. The sound is amazing — it’s like it’s coming from inside your head — and you can see the musicians breathe and their body language and how they communicate with each other.” \nArron adds, “The church is so beautiful. The acoustics are perfect for chamber music and the audience proximity makes it a magical experience. It’s like everything aligned to make this a perfect setting. Old Lyme’s proximity to New York City means there are a lot of arts-loving people in this area who’ve taken advantage of the opportunity to see the best the world has to offer. They know what they’re listening to and have a real appreciation for the fine musicians we’ve gotten. And they get to hear it in this wonderful building.” \nIf the programming and musicianship remain world-class, Arron has continued Wadsworth’s tradition of maintaining a familial, casual atmosphere through anecdotal, conversational and often amusing commentary during concerts. \n“It’s very unique,” Murphy says. “I like to say it’s a great paradox, what we do. It’s like a Southern barbecue — sit back and have a beer and hear a great story about Mozart. And then this dazzling, stunning music follows.” \nMusical Masterworks 2015-16 schedule \nAll concerts are at 5 p.m. Saturdays and 3 p.m. Sundays at the First Congregational Church of Old Lyme, 2 Ferry Road, Old Lyme. \nFor ticket information, call (860) 434-2252 or visit www.musicalmasterworks.org. \nToday and Sunday: Schubert Piano Trio in One Movement in B-flat Major, D. 28; Schumann Three Fantasy Pieces for Horn and Piano, Opus 73; David Ludwig Three Yiddish Dances for Piano, Violin and Cello (2010); Otto Ketting Intrada for Solo Horn (1958); Brahms Trio in E-flat Major for Piano, Horn and Violin, Opus 40.
