Howard, who's surprised by the thought of someone telling Blunt not to go naked, pressed her on who she meant by \"we.\" John Krasinski 's wife responded with a laugh, saying, \"My tits. [They said] 'we're not doing it.' \" Blunt went on to say that Benicio Del Toro backed up her decision to have the racy scene canceled. \"Benicio [Del Toro] backed me up,\" she said. \"It was a scene between he and I.\" During the interview, Blunt was also asked about her past romance with ex Michael Buble . When asked about Buble's alleged infidelity during their relationship, the \" Edge of Tomorrow \" actress replied, \"I don't know, it's complicated. I never want to talk about it. I can't do it.\" Blunt said she \"had a good time\" with Buble and that she still cares for the \"Haven't Met You Yet\" singer's family. \"I loved his family,\" she shared, before clarifying, \"I love his family. I still do.\" \"Sicario\" is scheduled to hit U.S. theaters on October 2. Blunt has two movies released in 2016 including \" Animal Crackers \" and \" The Huntsman \". \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Sicario News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:36:21.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
