Live a life of love, focus on the good,” he tweeted.\nHe added, “We all have our own minds and for me, it was just another day. And that’s exactly what it is, just another day.”\nAsked by a Twitter user if he would have said no given the option, Yael said, “No one needs permission from me.”\nAs for another fan who felt sorry for him, he said, “I have a great wife and a great life. Don’t feel sorry for me.”\nIn a short interview with Bulletin Entertainment in Cebu the other day, Yael said he and Karylle did not talk about the kiss neither before nor after it happened. Yael believes the kiss was impromptu “or Karylle would have told me about it.” Being an artist himself, Yael said he “understands” it’s just “a performance.”", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T05:50:43.114+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
