On the Sunday before its final episode, PBS will air a marathon of the season up to that point and a behind-the-scenes program on how the show was made, reports the Associated Press. The network will also try to use “Downton Abbey” as a launching pad for “Mercy Street,” a Civil War drama premiering Jan. 17 directly after an episode of the outgoing hit.\nDetroit rocker Rikki St. James dead \nLocal musician Rikki St. James died Sunday. The guitarist was active in the Detroit punk scene of the 1970s and played with the band Motor City Bad Boys.

The broadcaster announced that Lane will depart his afternoon drive show on the broadcaster’s Detroit Sports 105.1 station immediately, as he did not renew his contract. Steve Chessare , vice president/market manager for Greater Media Detroit, said the issue wasn’t money. “The only issue we had is in show content,” Chessare said. “Drew has done a phenomenal job for Greater Media for 24 years, and he was instrumental in us getting the sports station launched, but we’ve come to recognize that we’ve got to be true to our format, which is sports, both to the audience and our clients and partners, that we deliver a sports product.” ... Out of respect for Drew and what he’s built and how successful he’s been, we’re OK with his decision not to continue and we wish him nothing but the best.” Lane has hosted the sports talk show since August 2013, a change of pace from the long-running “Drew and Mike” show he co-hosted at Greater Media’s WRIF-FM for years before that. “We’ve been talking about this for awhile, so it was no big shock today,” Lane told The News on Monday. “It was not about money, absolutely not. It was about adding a third person to the show ... somebody from the sports world ... Having the chemistry our show had for all these years, I just didn’t really want to do a three-person show.” Sports 105.1 midday host Matt Dery will serve temporarily as the fill-in host.\nMuse announces Joe Louis Arena date \nAlternative rock trio Muse will perform at Joe Louis Arena on Jan. 14, the band’s reps announced Monday.
