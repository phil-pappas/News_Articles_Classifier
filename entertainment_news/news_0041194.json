EAT BULAGA SOCIAL MEDIA \nHandsome Hunk was well on his way to recovery—kicking a nasty vice by staying away from the scene and its temptations for a while. \nA mole insists that HH has backslid in a major way recently. \nHH has succumbed to pressures in the biz—a scandal that rocked his personal life is to blame. Controversies involving Lady Love supposedly drove HH over the edge. ADVERTISEMENT \nHH is talented, but his on-set temper tantrums and unreliability cost him several assignments. \nNow insiders think HH should avoid LL, who seems to spark all the troubles in his world. \nBasket case \nCute Heartthrob has so far managed to elude the casting couch. CH attained success, minus the help of influential gays. \nTurned out powerful benefactors avoid CH like the plague. A mole claims CH is a certified basket case. \nOr as a source would put it: CH is schizoid. \nCH’s supposed shenanigans seem to prove the idle chatter. \nFace off \nBubbly Starlet is a huge fan of Major Star. \nBS, however, is taking her admiration for MS to an extreme level. After undergoing a series of painful cosmetic procedures, BS now looks eerily like MS. \nBS had her own charm before going under the knife. But now BS is nothing but a second-rate, trying-hard copycat. \nMS will surely raise a well-plucked brow the next time she sees her stunning “twin” face-to-face. \nIt would be the face-off to end all face-offs. Afraid! \nShake-up \nControversial Celeb would like to keep it under wraps, but an insider insisted that High-profile Project had undergone a major shake-up. \nFormer Partner backed out of HP for some reason. Dashing Buddy came to the rescue. \nDB purportedly replaced FP. To top it off, Perky Tandem was added to the venture as well. (After all, a competing enterprise boasts wildly Popular Duo.) \nIt’s a win-win proposition for CC, PD and DB. As for FP? Well, FP is too busy to fret over the changes. \nEpic fail \nFrom the Inquirer tabloid Bandera: \nSultry Starlet thought she had it in the bag. SS attended a splashy event in the arms of Dreamy Date. SARAH Geronimo feels it’s important to touch base with fans. \nAfter one drink too many, SS got bored with DD and tried to seduce Charming Cutie. \nSS was so scandalously soused and salacious, DD got fed up and walked out of the sordid scene. \nSS continued to pursue CC who was spooked and scampered away. SS ended up going home by her lonesome. \nTop of the Talk Shows \nFor those who missed last weekend’s “CelebriTV” on GMA 7 (and why we are moved, if we are moved): \nRegine Velasquez’s son Nate on guesting in her show “Sarap Diva”: “Masaya ako kasi artista na ako.” (Starting ’em young.) \nMaine Mendoza, asked if she has changed her mind about wanting to be a flight attendant: “Mas gusto ko pong mag-artista.” (Fly high, but stay grounded.) \nMaine on how AlDub changed her life: “Marami pong nagbago … siyempre ’yung privacy.” (Part of the package, dear.) \nMaine, asked if Alden Richards has a chance in real life: “’Di po natin masabi. Posible naman po.” (That’s a yes!) KZ TANDINGAN dreams of pursuing an international career. RICHARD REYES \nAlden on last week’s kalyeserye episode: “Kitang-kita naman na enjoy kaming lahat… . It makes us feel good. Excited na ako kung anong mangyayari next week.” (Uuuy!) \nSarah Geronimo on personally selling tickets to her December concert: “Maganda ’yung may interaction sa mga tao.” (Talk about being hands-on.) \nKZ Tandingan on her dreams: “Pangarap ko na marinig ako internationally.” (Go girl!) \nKris Aquino, on who gets her vote in next year’s election: “I’ve been honest from the start that I’ll go with P-Noy.” (Moving on.)
