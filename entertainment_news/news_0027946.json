Heard of her? \nShe plays Alex Parrish, an FBI agent framed for a crime she allegedly didn't commit, on the new show \"Quantico.\" Before this role though, Chopra has been a one-woman Bollywood blockbuster . She's India's \"it\" girl — starring in nearly 50 films. And now, she's ready to take on the wild, wild West. (Video via T-Series ) \nChopra's no stranger to the States. She went to high school here, but honestly, it could have gone better . \n\"Well, I had some major racist issues when I was in school. ... There was this one girl who hated me. Her name was Jeanine something. It's because of you I became this way, Jeanine. I should find you on Facebook,\" Chopra said. \nChopra went on to win Miss World in 2000, representing India, and she later became a household name in her home country. She's acquired more than 31 million followers across social media platforms, and it looks like she's well on her way to winning us over as well. \n>>Read more trending stories \nTwo years ago, Chopra started dabbling in the American entertainment industry. The star paired up with artists like Pitbull , dropped a few singles of her own and even became the face and sound of \"Thursday Night Football.\" \nHer largest musical accomplishment, however, may be this confession: \"I'm going to say this on national television right now , you guys, but I was supposed to be Mrs. Tupac Shakur.\" \nNow she's breaking barriers on American television as the first Indian-born performer to lead a network show. \n\"Do you have any thoughts on diversity in Hollywood? \" asked TMZ. \n\"I think we're getting there, and I think it's an amazing time for diversity,\" responded Chopra. \n\"Do you think diversity is needed behind the camera as well or just in front?\" \n\"I think what we need is a color-blind world,\" said Chopra.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T08:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T18:12:56.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
