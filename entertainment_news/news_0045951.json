A helicopter filmed along the road, lined with tall buildings and the Dubai Metro. \nActors involved in “Star Trek Beyond,” directed by Justin Lin, arrived in Dubai several days ago. The film is set for release in July. \nDubai’s Burj Khalifa skyscraper played a starring role in 2011’s “Mission: Impossible — Ghost Protocol.” J.J. Abrams, who helmed the last two “Star Trek” films, shot parts of the upcoming “Star Wars: Episode VII” in Abu Dhabi. The city was also a location for the most recent “Fast & Furious” movie installment.
