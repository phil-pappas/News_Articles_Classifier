Yet they each provide extraordinary views of both nature and the built environment for tourists. Dozens of museums and scenic views kept us entertained for days.\nSeparated by a scenic seven-hour train ride in Norway is the west coast city of Bergen and the capital city of Oslo to the east. While both are equally interesting and picturesque, they are as different as salt and pepper.\nThis last spring, my wife and I had the opportunity to take my daughter Amber to explore both cities when she chose Norway for our vacation.\nBergen, known for its fish market, is situated on the Puddefjorden and has access to the western fjords. These are the fjords you find on postcards and travel magazines with pictures of steep, cut-off mountains and numerous waterfalls on both sides of the waterway.\nOur visit to Bergen was too early in the year for the organized sightseeing cruises to be in operation, so my advice is to go later during the year if the western fjords are on your bucket list.\nBut Bergen has so much more to see than just the fjords.\nWe found thar a good place to start was the funicular railway that takes you to Fløyen at the top of a mountain. After an eight-minute ride and elevation gain of more than a thousand feet, we had a spectacular aerial view of most of Bergen and the surrounding water. There is also a nice restaurant where we had a light lunch while we enjoyed the view.\nFrom Fløyen, we were able to pinpoint other attractions we wanted to visit, which helped us plan the rest of our stay.\nLooking down past the funicular is Bryggen, the wharf area of colorful wooden Hansa houses. One of northern Europe’s oldest cities, it was established as a center for trade in the 12th century and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site today. What makes these buildings so special, besides their unique architecture and vibrant hues, is that they are survivors of several devastating fires over the years, and the existing buildings are much the same as they were in the early 18th century.\nWe wandered through Bryggen and shopped for souvenirs in the delightfully rustic shops. Between the buildings, through narrow alleys, it was incredible to see the haphazard way they were constructed and added upon for years.\nWe also came across several extraordinary wood carvings: a Nordic axe man and a 30-foot sea creature, possibly a fish, which Amber just had to kiss.\nFrom Fløyen, looking up the peninsula past Bryggen, is Håkonshallen , a 13th-century fortress and the oldest secular medieval building still standing in Norway. The Rosenkrantztarnet tower is adjacent to the fortress and was built in the 16th century.\nBetween the fortress and Bryggen is the oldest church in Bergen still in use, St. Mary’s Church. We happened to walk in just as a local university was in the final stages of a multiyear restoration project, and one of the professors uncovered a sublime gesso fresco for us to admire. Maybe I’ll be able to return to Bergen someday to see the rest of the historic church when it is reopened for worship.\nThe little peninsula on which both the fortress and the church are located provided some of the prettiest sunsets I’ve ever witnessed. There is nothing quite like the orange light reflecting off the multicolored buildings of Bryggen as the sun sets behind the fortress.\nBergen also has several diverse museums. My favorite was a short distance from the center of town in Troldhaugen. Along the shore of Lake Nordås is the summer retreat of the 19th-century classical composer Edvard Grieg . It’s a small house preserved for decades just how Grieg left it with manuscripts lying around and his personal piano still in working order. It also has an incredible view that must have inspired him as much as it did us.\nOslo, on the other hand, is more contemporary but equally enjoyable. I would urge anyone traveling between the two cities to take the train at least in one direction to fully enjoy the Norwegian countryside as well as the snowbound mountains.", "external_links": ["http://www.bymuseet.no/index.php?vis=78&spr=en", "http://floyen.no/en/company/", "http://www.spottinghistory.com/view/3235/st-marys-church/", "http://griegmuseum.no/en"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:13:57.247+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
