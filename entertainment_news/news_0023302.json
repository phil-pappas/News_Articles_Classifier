(CBS photo) 'Survivor''s Jeff Varner goes off on 'Second Chance' contestants \nNo one was more surprised by the results of this week’s Survivor Cambodia: Second Chance tribal council than Monica Padilla , who unexpectedly became the fifth person voted out of the strategic all-star game thanks to a shocking blindside from her very own alliance. The 30-year-old Queens, N.Y., player was eliminated by a majority of just three back-stabbing votes, when Bayon-tribe allies Kimmi Kappenberg, Stephen Fishbach and Jeremy Collins, suspected the former Survivor: Samoa-player of flip-flopping and masterminding a future “all girls’ alliance,” therefore cutting her loose before she posed any real threat. \n“I had no idea. I trusted them, which I guess was the wrong thing to do,” Padilla told Postmedia Network following her elimination episode this week. “They really didn’t give me any indication that they were turning on me. I thought we were going to stick together and be loyal to Bayon but it didn’t work out.” \nEven though admittedly a player who strategized endlessly, Monica ensures she had no real plan to turn on her Bayon squad, at least until much later in the game, and that her comments regarding the all-girls’ plan shouldn't have been taken so seriously by the person Monica assumed was her number one comrade. \n“I was planning on staying loyal, but at the same time, I wanted to keep my options. Because even if I did stick with Bayon, I wanted to be sure that we had different options. The women’s alliance wasn’t necessarily a set thing going in. I just said that before we start getting rid of people, we need to make sure we have that as an option.” \nBut rather than taking Monica's words with a grain of salt, former Australian Outback player Kimmi ran back to Jeremy and Stephen, where the trio plotted Monica's demise in a blindside so shocking, it took Monica months to find out what really happened. “I never thought that it was Kimmi who voted for me. Kimmi and I were tight. When we came back from the trip from Asia, we ended up running into the jury at the airport and I saw Jeremy. I went and gave him a big hug and said, ‘Oh my god, good play. Who was it?’ He said, ‘You don’t know?’ I was astonished. That’s when I found out.” \nBut although a shock, Monica takes responsibly for her second chance ending by admitting she was way too comfortable in her alliance and with the assumption that it was either Spencer Bledsoe or Kelly Wiglesworth going home. \nAnd for Monica, the $1 million blindside won’t be a grudge she plans to carry with her for very long as she plans to put her elimination and her time on Survivor in the past. \n“For me, once I’m out of that world, I try and just put it behind me. It has nothing to do with real life. It’s a game.” \nSurvivor Cambodia: Second Chance airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. on Global and CBS. \nTwitter: @samomaryleona", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:45:00.389+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
