When he fails to complete the task properly, it sets the stage for a horrifying moment as Stacey (Lacey Turner) suffers a nasty electric shock while hosting a Halloween party in her home.The celebrations are cut short as Stacey is rushed to hospital and everyone fears for the wellbeing of mum and baby. Lee, meanwhile, is sent into a spiral as his guilt makes his ongoing depression even worse.James Bye, who plays Martin, revealed: \"Martin punches Lee and it was good to play. I think the way we've approached the 'new 3.0 Martin' is that he's just a normal bloke. We don't want him to be anything else. He's come back to Walford and he wants to start again.\"But at the end of the day, if you put something like that in front of him - a situation where he thinks his girlfriend and baby are both dead - he's obviously going to react.\"Martin wears his heart on his sleeve. Unfortunately he doesn't deal with things like that very well, so he just reacts in the moment. You'll see the repercussions of the punch with Lee and it doesn't just get forgotten.\" © BBC / Jack Barnes/Kieron McCarronDanny-Boy Hatchard as Lee Carter Martin is currently looking forward to settling down with Stacey as a proper family unit, but EastEnders boss Dominic Treadwell-Collins recently teased that Stacey's unborn child might not actually be his - leaving fans to speculate that Kush Kazemi is the real father.Asked how Martin would react if this was the case, Bye laughed: \"Well how would you feel? He's put so much effort in with Stacey, he's head over heels in love with her and he's now starting to feel that he's getting that in return. At the minute, in his mind, the baby is his.\"Martin loves Stacey and the baby just fits in with their relationship. I genuinely don't know what happens between them or whether the baby's his or not. We don't know for certain - they keep you in the dark and I have no idea.\"It's now been over a year since Bye was announced as the new Martin, taking over from James Alexandrou who played the character between 1996 and 2007. © BBCMartin and Stacey Reflecting on the mixed reaction he received from fans at first, Bye admitted: \"I took on the job knowing full well that I was going to come into it with some stick. James Alexandrou did a great job and played the role for a long, long time. People were invested in the actor, so when the new face comes in, people are always going to be asking, 'Who's this fella?'\"I can't do anything about that. All I can do is be completely understanding to the fact that people are going to react like that. I try just to block it out. If fans take to me, that's fantastic because it always helps. If they don't, they don't, and I have no control over it. \"With the stuff coming up, Martin goes on a journey so hopefully people can get on board and follow him through it.\"EastEnders airs its dramatic hour-long Halloween episode on Friday, October 30 at 7.30pm on BBC One.EastEnders gets hour-long special as Halloween hits Albert SquareEastEnders star Shona McGarty reveals a new direction for Whitney: 'She'll be a strong woman'Read more EastEnders spoilers and newsDigital Spy Soap Scoop video - hit play below for gossip on more Gloved Hand Killer deaths in Hollyoaks, the reveal of Robert Sugden's shooter in Emmerdale, a drastic decision from Kathy Beale in EastEnders and Alya Nazir's guilt spiralling out of control in Coronation Street. function onTemplateLoaded(experienceID) { bcExp = brightcove.getExperience(experienceID); modVP = bcExp.getModule(APIModules.VIDEO_PLAYER); modExp = bcExp.getModule(APIModules.EXPERIENCE); modCon = bcExp.getModule(APIModules.CONTENT); modVP.addEventListener(BCMediaEvent.BEGIN, onVideoStart); modVP.addEventListener(BCMediaEvent.STOP, onVideoStop); modVP.addEventListener(BCMediaEvent.PROGRESS, onVideoProgress); } #_containermyExperience4551550723001 { height: 100%; } // InSkin integration parameters: InSkinParams['myInSkin14551550723001'] = { 'srv_SectionID': '', 'srv_SectionIDPlay': '123757', 'srv_Keywords': '', 'plr_ContentID': 'myExperience4551550723001', 'plr_ContentType': 'BRIGHTCOVE3', 'plr_ContentW': 558, 'plr_ContentH': 314, 'plr_NoSkinContentResize': true, 'plr_NoSkinContentW': 618, 'plr_NoSkinContentH': 348, 'plr_NoSkinInSkinResize': true, 'plr_NoSkinInSkinW': 618, 'plr_NoSkinInSkinH': 348, 'plr_ResizeOnHideSkin': true, 'plr_HideSkinOnExternalAd': 'all', 'plr_ShowSkinAfterExternalAd': true, 'cnt_SmartPlayer': true }; // create the InSkin object: var InSkinObject4551550723001 = new InSkin.Base('myInSkin14551550723001'); brightcove.createExperiences(); if (!navigator.userAgent.match(/Android/i)) { InSkinObject4551550723001.init(); ai_type=\"video\"; } Get the Inside Soap magazine on your iPhone or iPad", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:20:20.192+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
