Whatever, man, it's a trick,\" Hawkeye said in \"Avengers: Age of Ultron.\" \n\"No, it is much more than that, my friend,\" Thor replies. \nTurns out Thor's hammer, Mjolnir, might actually be more than just a movie prop . \nSo is this guy the true guardian of Asgard? It turns out he's Allen Pan, an electrical engineer who goes by the name of Sufficiently Advanced on YouTube. He made the incredibly advanced gadget out of simple household items . \nThe key is the electro-magnet that's activated whenever someone grabs the handle â€” unless their fingerprints match up with a fingerprint scanner that disables the magnet, they're not lifting the hammer off the ground. \nFamous astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson theorized the real hammer of Thor would weigh billions of tons. \nBut this magnetic one only denies the unworthy when it's on a metal surface. And you can still find a creative way to work around that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:02:55.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
