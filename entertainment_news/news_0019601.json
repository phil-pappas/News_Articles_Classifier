Circus set up its traveling big top for the enjoyment of Slidell families. The large red tent was erected for just a few days on the grounds of the Northshore Harbor Center.\nNearby, the circus' 18-wheelers and recreational vehicles -- used to transport the full production, including animals and performers -- seemed dwarfed in comparison to the festive tent topped with American flags.\nJust before each show -- and later, during intermission -- audience members were allowed to ride an elephant for a fee. Before the last Slidell show, on Tuesday (Oct. 6), several families enjoyed taking brief rides atop the lumbering and beautiful pachyderms.\nThe big top of the Cole Bros. Circus was impossible to miss when it was on the grounds of the Northshore Harbor Center for performances held Oct. 5 and 6. (Kara Martinez Bachman photo) Attendance was low and there were many empty seats for the last show. The children, waving their light-up swords and eating popcorn, didn't seem to mind, and busied themselves with taking in the old-fashioned, traditional circus acts. A large group of tigers was put through their paces by their tamer; acrobats took to the air to walk wires and dangle from pulleys and ropes; clowns performed silly, child-appropriate skits; elephants stole the show with the majesty of their size; and, as a grand finale, a man was shot from an enormous cannon.\nA brief moment of excitement came when a tightrope walker lost his footing during a stunt that was performed without a net. The audience gasped, and the acrobat began the trick again, successfully completing his blindfolded walk overhead. Although it is not completely clear whether or not the misstep was real or a part of the show, the moment underscores the danger of stunts performed in the old-style circus ring.\nA huge cannon, photographed just moments before it ejected a \"human cannonball\" daredevil into a net on the other side of the three-ring tent. The stunt was the grand finale of the Cole Bros. Circus performance in Slidell on Oct. 6. (Kara Martinez Bachman) Although generally considered to be waning in popularity, the traveling circus is still a part of the American landscape. While many circuses have moved on and no longer erect and perform under a big top, Cole Bros. Circus -- which began in 1884 -- continues on with striving to maintain, according to the company's marketing, \"the tradition of presenting the real American three-ring circus, under the big top.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T22:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:41:36.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
