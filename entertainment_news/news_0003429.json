The publication claimed that the rumored couple was recently engaged in his hometown, Toronto, Canada. The magazine quoted a so-called \"insider\" as saying, \"[Serena] said yes, but they want to keep it on the down-low for now,\" before adding, \"Right now they're happy with just being happy.\" The \"Back to Back\" rapper, according to the source, didn't want to split from the tennis athelete again. \"Now that he has her, he isn't letting her go,\" said the source of Drake. Both Drake and Serena haven't commented on the engagement report yet. The two have also remained silent about whether or not they're dating. Nevertheless, a rep for Drake told TMZ that the engagement rumor was \"completely untrue.\" Rumor about Drake dating Serena emerged after photos of them kissing and making out during a dinner date surfaced in late August. At that time, they were joined by six other people and at one point ordered a round of tequila shots for the table. Most recently, they showed heavy PDA at New York Fashion Week. The two couldn't keep their hands off each other while having a nice conversation. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:59:33.920+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
