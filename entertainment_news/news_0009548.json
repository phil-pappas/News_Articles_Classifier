(AP) — The Jersey shore home where Bruce Springsteen wrote the album \"Born to Run\" is back on the market.\nThe two-bedroom cottage at 7 ½ West End Court in Long Branch is owned by three fans of the singer. They bought it in 2009 with the idea of turning the home into a tribute to the New Jersey rock legend, but those plans were derailed.\nSpringsteen has said that he wrote every song on the \"Born to Run\" album — including the title track and other classic songs such as \"Thunder Road\" and \"Jungleland\" — while living in the home from 1974 to 1975.\nThe house does occasionally draw visitors, and the current owners say they try to accommodate the fans.\nThe home's list price is $299,000.\nArts & Entertainment Media Bruce Springsteen", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:29:41.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
