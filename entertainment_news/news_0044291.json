All that remains unknown is when White Chocolate will close. Representatives of the restaurant and its parent company, Arizona-based Slatebridge Restaurant Group, could not be immediately reached for comment Friday. But Caitlin Morrissey, a public relations representative for Giordano's, confirmed that the popular pizzeria will be opening at 930 N. Meacham Road on a yet unspecified date during the first quarter of 2016. Morrissey said Giordano's wanted a Schaumburg location because of the current void of Giordano's coverage in the area. She said Schaumburg residents are known to regularly travel to other locations a significant distance from their own neighborhoods. Schaumburg village officials confirmed Friday that Giordano's filed a formal request for a liquor license this week. Back in July, an attorney representing Giordano's appeared at a Schaumburg village board meeting to inquire about a liquor license and request the start of a background check necessary to get one, at White Chocolate's current address. At that time, employees of White Chocolate said they knew of no plans for their own restaurant to close. Prior to White Chocolate, the location housed the Lincoln Whiskey Kitchen. Before that, it was Ted's Montana Grill. Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T00:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:19:25.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
