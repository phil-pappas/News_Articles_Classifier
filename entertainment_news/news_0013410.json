Ethan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Isaac (Seth Rogen) and Chris (Anthony Mackie) have been friends since childhood, and for a decade, their yearly Christmas Eve reunion has been an annual night of debauchery and hilarity. Now that theyÂ’re entering adulthood, the tradition is coming to an end, and to make it as memorable as possible, they set out to find the Nutcracka Ball -- the Holy Grail of Christmas parties. The Night Before stars Seth Rogen, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Anthony Mackie, Jillian Bell, Lizzy Caplan, Mindy Kaling, Miley Cyrus Release: November 25th, 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:54:51.287+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
