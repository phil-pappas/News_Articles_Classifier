But changes to state laws have decreased the number of available offenders eligible for the program.\nThey are housed at 43 unfenced, minimum-security camps across the state, including eight that lodge about 600 inmates who respond to fires and other natural disasters primarily in Riverside, San Bernardino and Orange counties. When out of camp cutting fire breaks, stacking sand bags or providing other assistance, the crews are supervised by firefighters and not corrections officers.\nAn average of nine inmates walk away each year, state statistics say.\nThe Department of Corrections proposal, which must be approved by that agency as well as Cal Fire, would add to the crews inmates convicted of violent offenses such as assaults and robberies, if their security classification level has been reduced after years of good behavior.\nRiverside County Sheriff Stan Sniff on Monday, Oct. 12, noted that offenders once considered too violent to serve their time in county jails are now being considered suitable to work from fire camps with minimal security.\n“The Sheriff’s Department does not support placing state prisoners with violent backgrounds into unsecured fire camps throughout our many California communities,” Sniff said.\n“I think the fact that they were sentenced by our courts to state prison … makes a strong potential that they will walk away from fire camps and victimize local community members, causing precious law enforcement resources to be diverted to recapture escapees or investigate new crimes committed. In Riverside County’s unincorporated areas, we are still very much understaffed and awaiting funding decisions by our Board of Supervisors on those needed staffing increases,” Sniff said.\nNo one at the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department could be reached for comment on the Columbus Day holiday Monday.\nThere are no fire camps in Orange County, but inmate crews do help fight wildfires there.\nOrange County Sheriff’s Department spokesman Lt. Jeff Hallock said Monday that the department sends only non-violent inmates to fire camps. Hallock said the department doesn’t have a position on the Department of Corrections proposal but added that it comes with uncertainty.\n“Any proposal to a change in policy providing for expansion of eligibility for state inmate firefighting crew comes with a greater risk,” Hallock said. “The number of available non-violent / non-serious inmates continues to be limited due to AB 109, so the proposal would create a calculated, but measured risk based on their history and demonstrated conduct while in prison.”\nFEWER ELIGIBLE INMATES\nAB 109, known as realignment, is partly responsible for creating the need for the Department of Corrections proposal.\nOfficials are proposing loosening the rules because the number of available inmates has been shrinking since late 2011. That’s when, under court order to reduce overcrowding, California began keeping thousands of lower-level offenders in county jails, leaving a higher proportion of violent and serious criminals in state prisons.\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:24:19.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
