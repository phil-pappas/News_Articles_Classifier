Special effects makeup, just like you see in the movies, can transform you into any kind of crazy creature you can imagine. And professional SFX makeup artists like Lemmie Crews and Ashley Poindexter can help you take that to a level that’s on par with what you might see on the big screen. \nCrews (“Lemmie Crews” on Facebook) works for Kinematic Entertainment and has done screen-quality work on multiple productions, as well as contracting individual jobs for Halloween and other occasions. For him, SFX makeup has been a life-long calling. Buy Photo Artist Lemmie Crews works on zombie makeup for the Halloween Costume Fashion Show at Spirit Halloween.

She explained to me that it was fake, and I was hooked on figuring out how. I figured out who did the makeup for the film and ordered his book, ‘Dick Smith’s Do-It-Yourself Monster Make-Up Handbook.’ I practiced the techniques in the book, mostly on myself, and studied up on other makeup artists and styles, ordering ‘how-tos’ from the back of horror mags, as well as trying to reverse-engineer the FX inside (the magazines), all in an age with no Internet.” \nPoindexter (email ShadesOfAgonySFX@gmail.com, or “Shades of Agony SFX by Ashley Pdexter” on Facebook) shares a similar life-long devotion sparked by early exposure to movie magic. \n“As a child, I was always fascinated by movies like ‘Stars Wars,’ ‘Labyrinth’ and ‘Jaws,’ not because they are amazing movies, but because of the special effects and makeup — the exaggeration of noses, cheekbones, eyes, etc., and the prosthetic pieces that create such unique creatures,” she said. “That was just the start of my fascination. Then when I was about 7, I watched ‘It’ and ‘A Nightmare on Elm Street’ — of course, behind my parents’ backs. And I fell in love with the way the created such epic characters.” \nBig SFX jobs can offer big challenges, but the pros say there is a lot you can learn to do yourself. The first thing you’ll want to worry about, though, is possible skin reactions to heavy makeup, latex and other products. \n“Always check to see what you’re putting on your face or body,” Poindexter said. “You don’t want to apply something to your skin and then have a horrible reaction and spend your Halloween in the hospital or at the doctor’s. You’ll be a patient instead of that rad killer clown you wanted to be.” \nPoindexter said simple store-bought kits are a great way to get started on doing your own FX job. \n“For beginners, Spirit Halloween has some ready-made prosthetic pieces, and you can learn to blend the pieces into your own body,” she said. “Blending can be the most difficult part. But just like we were told growing up, practice makes perfect.” \nSeek out tutorials, too. As Crews mentioned, there are some great books on the topic, but imagination, initiative and the Internet can take you a long way, too. \n“YouTube has some awesome tutorials,” Poindexter said. “I’m self-taught and learned everything I know by trial and error.” \n“Any new experiences are ways to learn and sharpen your skills,” Crews said. “Learning from others, yourself or teaching others.” \nOf course, with Halloween less than a month away, if you’re looking for something truly special, you’re going to want to hire a pro. \n“A pro already has all of the tools and the skill set,” Crews said. “They come prepared to make your vision a reality.” \n“Hiring a professional means getting something done by someone who has studied the craft and knows exactly what to do,” Poindexter said. “If you feel the job is too challenging, or if you want it to be legit, hire a professional.” \nBut Halloween makeup doesn’t have to horrify, and it doesn’t have to be heavy or FX-based, either. Traditional makeup can help take any costume to the next level. \n“Beauty makeup can absolutely enhance a costume,” said professional makeup artist Jennifer Rogers (“Jennifer Rogers” on Facebook; “scjennr” on Instagram). “The makeup can finish a costume by making the whole look cohesive. Often people wear period costumes, and the appropriate makeup for that time will make it look authentic.” \nShe offers some tips for Halloween hotness. \n“A lot of women like to match eye or lip color to a primary color in their dress,” she said. For example, for a sultry cop look, you’d typically want a dark blue smokey eye and a nude lip. Give yourself plenty of time before your event to get your makeup done, so you're not rushed, and so things can be corrected if needed. I also recommend long-wearing makeup if you're going to be partying well into the evening.” \nAnd just as with FX jobs, professional help is available. \n“I would absolutely hire an artist when intricate detail and a higher skill level would be required,” Rogers said. “Talk to your artist openly about what you want, and I find it very helpful to have photos to reference.” \nMore online \nVisit pnj.com to watch artist Lemmie Crews transform PNJ Community Content Editor Julio Diaz into Frankenstein’s Monster and learn more about makeup in behind the scenes video from our free Halloween Costume Fashion Show, plus check out dozens of photos from the event. \nComing Sunday \nSee some of this year’s hottest Halloween costumes from our fashion show with Spirit Halloween in Sunday’s Ghost, er, COAST Life. 42 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.pnj.com/1L8SA67 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:22:04.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
