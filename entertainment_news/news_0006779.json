Curtis M. Wong Gay Voices Senior Editor, The Huffington Post Posted: 10/13/2015 03:27 PM EDT \nSocial media star and former \"X-Factor\" hopeful Trevor Moran has come out as gay. \nMoran, 17, released a music video for his new song, \" I Wanna Fly ,\" last month that hinted at his sexuality, but he opted to make a more formal announcement in a new clip which hit YouTube Oct. 9. \n\"Basically – if it’s a shocker to any of you – I’m gay,\" Moran told his nearly one million subscribers in the six-minute video. He then clarified, \"I don’t feel like I was ever in the closet. I feel like I was in a glass closet.\" \nAnswering some tweeted questions from viewers, Moran added, \"I thought I was bisexual for a long time because I was just so frightened by the word 'gay.'\" \n\"I did definitely try to be straight and experiment with girls. It just doesn’t work,\" he said. \nThe music video for \"I Wanna Fly,\" which was released Sept. 29, shows Moran sharing a brief embrace with another man before a troupe of dancers dressed in gas masks and combat gear tear him away. (Check out that video above) \n\"I think it is an awesome way to get a message across,\" he said of the clip. \nMoran auditioned for \"The X Factor\" in 2012, when he was just 13 years old, but was eliminated during the show's \"Boot Camp\" stage. His debut EP, \" XIAT ,\" was released in 2014. \nBravo, Trevor!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T22:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:59:00.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
