Try the new \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\" art.\nThe play's official artwork was released today on interactive fansite Pottermore. Reminiscent of both a Quidditch snitch and a bird, the art depicts wings above a nest-like enclosure housing a child.\n\"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\" will tell a new story in the \"Harry Potter\" saga, though writer J.K. Rowling insists that the play is not a prequel. She also shot down theories that the child in the play is a young Lord Voldemort.\nRowling recently announced that the play is in two parts, designed to be seen either on the same day or on consecutive days.\n\"Obviously I loved it when we decided to tell this story in two parts,\" writer Jack Thorne Pottermore, \"because I got to spend more time with the characters and what an honour that has been.\"\nIn addition to Rowling and Thorne, the play will also be presented by director John Tiffany.\n\"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\" opens in London's West End next summer. Just days are left to register for priority booking , which gives fans the first opportunity to buy tickets before they go on sale to the general public this fall. Priority registration ends this Saturday, Oct. 24.\nPottermore is asking fans to post their thoughts about the newly revealed art on social media with #CursedChild. As for Rowling herself, she tweeted that she loves it.\nSo, what do you think?", "external_links": ["http://www.harrypottertheplay.com/", "https://www.pottermore.com/news/cursed-child-artwork-revealed"], "published": "2015-10-23T01:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:48:18.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
