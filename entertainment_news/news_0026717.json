The former co-stars exchanged vows in front of family and friends in Malibu Canyon, California on Saturday, October 10. \"It was everything we wanted it to be and it was so nice after so many years together to finally celebrate our relationship with all of our friends and family,\" Park told Us Weekly in a statement. \"It's nice to have everyone we love in one place finally for all these years to celebrate our love for each other.\" They had fall as theme of the wedding. There was no bridesmaids or groomsmen because \"we felt like there were so many people that we would want to have, include in it, but we decided to sort of keep it simple and just have a maid of honor and best man and be happy that everybody else was there.\" The ceremony took place inside the Triunfo Creek Vineyards and the reception was held outdoors with a food truck, a bluegrass band, and ping-pong tables on set. \"We have a lot of barbecues and hangs with our friends and family and we wanted this to kind of feel the same way, but just at this winery,\" Hilton said. \"We just kind of were throwing a little party that we'd want to be at!\" Park and Hilton met on the set of \" Charlie Bartlett \" in 2006. They announced the engagement in January this year. He proposed to her using a family heirloom, his great-grandmother's ring. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T05:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:06:44.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
