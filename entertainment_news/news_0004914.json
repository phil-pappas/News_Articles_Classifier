Unlike other content management systems, Webflow lets designers structure and design content however they’d like—all in-browser without writing database or template code. Further, clients and collaborators now can add and edit content with an intuitive on-page editor, so there’s no complex back-end systems to learn.\nWebflow has always provided a powerful alternative to template-based site builders that create cookie-cutter landing pages and websites. Now, with Webflow CMS, designers get all the features of a tool like Wordpress without the need for a team of web developers to customize it. They can simply design, refine and publish dynamic websites.\n“My brother Sergie and I used to build custom websites for clients together, and the process was always tedious and error-prone. We knew there had to be a better way, so we built Webflow to give professional designers the power to build websites without messing around with code,” said Webflow CEO and cofounder Vlad Magdalin. “Webflow CMS takes that a step further, enabling designers to create powerful, dynamic websites without having to set up complex databases or code templates. It also gives clients and content professionals more control over their content, since they can make live edits directly on the page.”\nSince its founding in 2012, more than 300,000 freelance, agency, and enterprise designers have used Webflow to design and launch custom, responsive websites, in a fraction of the time and at a much lower cost, since there’s no need for a development team.\nAbout Webflow\nCo-founders Vlad Magdalin, Sergie Magdalin, and Bryant Chou launched Webflow in 2012 to give creative professionals a powerful tool for building custom websites without code. After going through the Y Combinator accelerator, Webflow secured $1.5 million in seed funding from Khosla Ventures, Vaizra Investments, Tim Draper, and other high-profile angel investors. Today, more than 45,000 professionals use Webflow, including top designers at The New York Times, Groupon, and IDEO. Webflow is headquartered in San Francisco.
