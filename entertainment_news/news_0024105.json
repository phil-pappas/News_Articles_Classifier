And it's not going to be a good one for Caroline and Ridge as spoiler reports reveal that it won't be long until their secret will be discovered by the others. \nAccording to Realty Today , Caroline is having a hard time hiding her pregnancy symptoms at work. But her morning sickness will cost her the secret that she and Ridge have been trying to keep as Ridge has been doing everything he can to keep Thomas away from Caroline. He will be busy working to make sure that no one will find out about the child's true paternity. But Charlie and Pam will be the first ones to notice the signs and will begin to speculate on the baby news. It won't be long until the secret will be let out of the bag and shocks people in Forrester Creations. \nMeanwhile, the upcoming episodes will also show Ivy trying out being a lingerie model. Celeb Dirty Laundry detailed that the jewelry designer will be back at Forrester Creations. She's nervous about it but Wyatt is there to calm her bundle of nerves by showing off his mischievous side and throwing in some little striptease action. But Ivy isn't completely relieved off the anxiety as the tension between her and Steffy is not over yet. \nThe source said that another round of battle between Steffy and Ivy will take place. But Liam's had enough of their brawling when he sees them arguing again. He urges them to \"give it a rest\" and start acting like \"respectable Forresters or at least civilized human beings.\" That's the time the two will try to get along but apparently, it's not going to be an easy one and calling a truce seems far off. But spoilers say that the two will try their best to do it. Regardless of how long it will last, at least there's some improvement. \n\"The Bold and the Beautiful\" airs weekdays on CBS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T15:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:04:52.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
