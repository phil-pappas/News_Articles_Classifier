I stood in the rain, at 8 a.m., with a couple hundred other women , perhaps out of some sense of nostalgia. \nWhere I come from, shopping counts as a pastime, along with drinking before football games and driving your car around poorly designed highways. On weekends, my family would hit on all three. \nWe piled in and headed to the downtown parking garage, walked across a glassed-in bridge to spend a good part of the day traversing three fluorescent floors and a food court. \nMom hated the shopping mall, considered it a direct affront to hand-me-downs, thrift stores and outlet shops. \nShe’d find a meeting point and perch there with her book, while my sisters browsed the racks of Jacobson’s and Contempo Casuals, and I got an Auntie Anne’s pretzel, then sneaked into Limited Too to try on spaghetti-strap tank tops. \nIt was also the 1990s, when the indoor shopping mall was cool, before stores started leaving for gentrifying neighborhoods and outdoor, mixed-use spaces. \nWhen I moved to Fort Collins two years ago, I found a handful of cute Old Town boutiques, and a few chain stores, but largely no good shopping. \nNot such a big deal, when the city has bike trails, natural areas, a reservoir, not to mention breweries, to attract residents and visitors. For decades, Fort Collins has been focusing on maintaining its surroundings while preserving a historic downtown and developing modern far reaches. \nNow, though, it’s returning right to the middle, with a $313 million investment in that dusty indoor mall concept, which in our case is still half (empty?) with mediocre chain businesses. \nBack in Columbus, our mall, once the literal center of downtown, was left to rot, with the city scratching its head over what to do with it. \nEventually, it was turned into a green space, with offices and shops around the perimeter. \nAfter seeing the decline of one mall, and hearing a similar story here in Fort Collins, I have to say I’m a little concerned now for the second coming of Foothills fashion. \nThanks to the Midwest, I’ve brought with me to Colorado a recreational bordering on addictive shopping habit. Thanks to my mother, I’m also very discerning. \nBefore the rebirth of the mall, I shopped at T.J. Maxx almost exclusively in town. I take solace in sifting through packed racks, standing in the middle of aisles with sweaters upon sweaters over my street clothing, weighing my fingers down with no less than 10 hangers. \nPotentially, I am the Foothills Mall’s dream customer. Instead, here I am with half the city’s female population at the one good store this place will have to offer. \nI leave Nordstrom Rack an hour after the Grand Opening with a free tote bag and one deeply discounted pair of leggings, vowing to come back for more this weekend. \nThen, walking out to my car, I’m depressed at the site of it — through the rain drops, all the construction, the glinting light of H&M is my only hope in the distance. 28 CONNECT 6 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://noconow.co/1LSqbl5 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T15:35:45.573+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
