And Happy Feet danced its way into the top five Australian films of all time.\nJust imagine what a story featuring both a charismatic canine AND a rookery of cute-as-a-button fairy penguins could do.\nOddball , which has the added bonus of popular comedian/actor Shane Jacobson in the lead human role, opened at No 5 at the Aussie box office over the weekend with $1 million in ticket sales.\nBy Tuesday, the family film, based on the true story of Warrnambool chicken farmer Swampy Marsh, had more doubled that figure ($2,104,165), climbing all the way to the No 2 spot (behind Sony’ Pixels.)\nWhile it’s still early days yet for the homegrown crowd-pleaser, which has been released to coincide with the September school holidays, past experience would suggest that the filmmakers are on to a winning formula.\nDouble the appeal ...

I think people — and particularly children — respond to them in a way that’s really deep and emotional . “\n“They provide an easy way in. So you can tell stories about our own struggles, but tell them through the lens of an animal.”\nEnduring appeal ... Blinky Bill as voiced by Ryan Kwanten. Source: Supplied\nSupporting Harris’s thesis, albeit on a more modest scale, was Blinky Bill The Movie. It opened at No 7 over the weekend with a solid $250,000 tally — not bad for a (by Pixar standards) low-budget animation aimed at preschool audiences and likely to make most of its money in ancillary markets.\nThe weekend figures consolidate upon a bumper year for Australian productions, which posted a 6.1 per cent share of the overall box office last week — the best result in 14 years.\nCrowd-pleasers such as Mad Max: Fury Road ($21.65 million), The Water Diviner ($10.18 million), Paper Planes ($9.65 million) and Last Cab to Darwin ($6.76 million) have contributed to the current $50-million plus tally.\nOne of a kind ...
