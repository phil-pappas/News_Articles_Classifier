Crying Is A Personal Choice' The Huffington Post UK | By Daniel Welsh \nBoy George has addressed his recent on-set row with fellow ‘The Voice’ coach Paloma Faith .

I wasn't really in the mood, so I went, ‘not really’... and she went, 'No, we don't want one of you, we want you to take one of me and my friend'. \n“She totally turned it on me and I was like, I was in fits! I took a picture of her and her friend and I never forgot her. I turned up in a bad mood and when I left the club obviously I was in a much better mood because she really made me laugh. And when I finally met her, I was like I remember you, you were that girl.” \nBoy George’s recruitment on ‘The Voice’ has been marred with controversy, as he’s taken the seat previously occupied by Tom Jones , who has been openly critical of the show since he was ditched from the mentoring line-up. \nLast week, he claimed he “didn’t give a fuck” about the talent show anymore, adding: “If they don’t want me any more, they can go fuck themselves.” \nHow eloquently put. \n‘The Voice’ returns to our screens for its fifth series next year.
