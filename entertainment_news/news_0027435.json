Kaleidoscopic Pattern [photograph]. Retrieved from: http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/pictures/40000/velka/kaleidoscopic-pattern.jpg This article will explain the concrete implications which the mathematical field of complexity theory has for human life. More specifically, it will discuss how a mathematics of complexity and emergence can be generated from the metaphysics of the French philosopher Gilles Deleuze. John Protevi , in his writing on the usefulness of the metaphysics of Gilles Deleuze in the scientific field of complexity theory, makes a distinction between synchronic and diachronic emergence. Diachronic emergence is the \"production of new patterns and thresholds of behaviour.\" This diachronic emergence is what Deleuze refers to as an \"event.\" An event, in Deleuze's terminology, refers to something which repatterns a system. Think of synchronic emergence as continuing order and diachronic emergence as \"novelty.\" Deleuze wants to enable us, Protevi says, to speak of a third kind of emergence \"by letting us situate the organism or subject as one emergent unity in a field of such unities.\"\nBefore launching into an extended discussion of this distinction, some refreshers on the terminology of complexity theory may be in order. Keep in mind that the phase space which sounds attractors (which represent the normal behavior o a system in one of its behavioral patterns, as Protevi notes) are known as \"basins of attraction.\" The attractors in this phase space are continually surrounded by the presence of \"singularities,\" or points at which a graph of the function changes its direction, thus creating an entirely new pattern: \"A singularity in the manifold indicates a bifurcator in the phase space model which in turn represents a threshold where the real system changes qualitatively.\" Some bifurcators have the power to push a system to a totally new pattern. This is due to a \"thickness\" of a bifurcator which might otherwise \"be swallowed up by the negative feedback loops whose operation define normal functioning of a system following one of its patterns of behaviour.\" In other words, it interrupts a set of patterns of an attractor.\nSome systems are more resilient than others, and some are quite brittle. Attractors are maintained by \"negative feedback loops that respond to system fluctuations below a certain threshold of recuperation by quickly returning the system to its pattern.\" Resilient systems are \"stable.\" Others are brittle and may easily be pushed to \"death\" by perturbations. External \"events\" may trigger all sorts of reactions. Some are \"triggers\" which produce a pre-patterned reaction, such as how being spoken to may trigger a pre-determined disposition to language in a young human who is at the critical threshold of brain development during which they must be introduced to language in order to acquire linguistic competence. These environmental changes which are relevant to the interests are the system, as Protevi notes, are known as \"signs.\" These are not mere linguistic signifiers, but refer more broadly to \"the probability o triggering a response to a system.\" In this way, they are distinguished from other continental philosophers who may have bought wholesale into the linguistic turn by dealing exclusively with signifiers or chains of linguistic signification.\nSome signs provoke a stereotyped defense pattern or mechanism whose purpose is to maintain itself. This is the case when a system is sufficiently resilient to recuperate its stable pattern, or a sign is simply too weak. As Protevi notes \"fluctuations of a certain magnitude - beyond the recuperative power of the negative feedback loops or homeostatic mechanisms - will push the system past a threshold, perhaps to another pattern in its fixed repertoire, or perhaps into a 'death zone' where there are no patterns but only static or chaos.\" Sometimes new attractors are produced altogether. An old system dies and a new one is produced. This is simply known as \"learning.\" A fancy definition of \"development\" may refer to creation of new patterns for a system which goes on to repeat patterns unremarkable of a system for its kind. Learning may result in utterly new creation, according to Protevi, and it is this which he refers to as \"diachronic emergence\" or evolution.\"\nDiachronic emergence occurs when new patterns and thresholds of behavior are produced. This is called an \"event.\" As noted, an \"event\" utterly repatterns a system. Behavior that is produced is \"actual.\" This is opposed to the \"virtual\":\n\"...the virtual is the realm of patterns and thresholds, that is, those multiplicities, Ideas, or abstract machines that structure the intensive morphogenetic processes that produce actual systems and their behaviours. A behaviour pattern, or threshold at which a behaviour pattern is triggered, needs to be ontologically distinguished...from behaviour, just as singularities are distinguished from ordinary points on the graph. Thus patterns and thresholds are virtual, while behaviour is actual. An event, in creating new patterns and thresholds, restructures the virtual.\"\nProtevi uses the example of weather; a classic example of a chaotic system. Weather is genuinely chaotic but there are still long-term patterns. It is for this reason, he notes, that weather is unpredictable while climate is relatively predictable. On the one hand, the flap of a butterfly wing in a sensitive zone may radically alter weather patterns in an unpredictable manner. On the other hand, this does not change the fact that there are predictable number of hurricanes per year in specific areas, and so on.\nAs noted before, diachronic emergenve refers to the creation of new patterns and thresholds. Synchronic emergence, however, refers to one which allows \"focused systematic behaviour through constraining the action of component parts.\" This is what is known as \"reciprocal causality.\" Crucial to this is the distinction between upward and downward causality. Local-to-global causality is \"upward\" and \"produces focused systematic behaviour\" whereas global-to-local or \"downward\" causality \"constrains the local interaction of components.\" Synchronic emergence refers to \"emergence of 'order out of chaos'\" as Protevi puts it.\n\"The focus on the part/whole relation of synchronic emergence has caused a lot of mischief in social science with the structure/agency dilemma, and in philosophy of mind with the entire range of problems surrounding the issues of physicalism, eliminative materialism, reductionism, supervenience and so forth.\" How does one relate parts and wholes to one another? This is quite tricky. In any case, this is where the distinction between epistemological vs. ontological emergence comes into play. Deleuze argues that an entirely new ontological category for \"emergence\" must be created on the grounds that there are systems not reducible to their parts. This is in opposition to those who reject such systems as examples of genuine emergence on the grounds that we simply are ignorant to sensitivity of initial conditions, in which case ontological emergence may not be a component of the real world at all.\n\"Now what used to be called ontological emergence can sometimes be shown to have been merely epistemological emergence due to the immaturity of science at the time. For instance, Mill proposed water as emergent: H20 does not act like the 'combination' of hydrogen and oxygen. But quantum mechanics has shown ways to explain water's properties on the basis of the properties of hydrogen and oxygen.\"\nSynchronic emergence, as noted before, maintains itself by means of a negative feedback loop. It tries to absorb signs which may disrupt it and cause it to experience 'death' or chaos. Trajectories or attractors may be \"entrained\" once it has established a specific pattern. This threshold is referred to by Deleuze as a 'quasi-cause.' But does this quasi-cause deserve an ontological category all its own, as Deleuze thinks?\n\"One of the key issues here is multiple realizability, the way patterns which are modelled by identical singularity layouts in manifolds can appear in widely different instanciations. Following Lautman's ontological distinction between singularities and the traectories which are shaped by them, Deleuze says yes, here we need an ontological difference: the patterns defined by a layout of singularities in a manifold should be called virtual multiplicities, because they structure many spatio-temporally distinct intensive morphogenetic processes that result in widely different actual products. It's the quasi-causal action of these multiply realizable (in Deleuze's terms, differencially actualisable) patterns, patterns which channel behaviour and which are modelled in basins of attraction, which must be distinguished from the efficient, billiard ball, causality of negative feedback loops operating in intensive states and actual systems. And this is the reformed notion of final causality...\"\nFor Protevi, it is only \"when we study the onset of syncchronic emergence does the notion of quasi-cause make sense; hence we need to think diachronic emergence.\" In a synchronically emergent system, one finds \"a hierarchy of material systems.\" Individuals on one level are constituents of larger, emergent unities on another level (\"cell, organ, somatic body, social body.\" One can examine such entities or systems on various levels. The organism constituted by lower levels of hierarchies is one level itself, and one can examine this organism on various levels of hierarchies. Each level may constitute emergent systems or entities all their own. For Deleuze, \"the multplicity of agents as component parts of a subject is not simply equivalent to the 'society of mind' thesis, which deals only with the composition of a cognitive architecture of abstract functions,\" as Protevi points out. Thus, these levels are emergent entities in their own right and are not entirely reducible to the (admittedly indispensable) function which they contribute to the organism of which they are a part.\nWhat looks like systematic unity on one level may actually be an event or a process from the perspective of another level \"with a longer time scale.\" Thus, the death of a cell may be an \"event\" on a microbiological level, but this death may merely constitute a moment in the larger systematic unity of the human body. It is a catastrophe on a microbiological level but absorbed by the negative feedback loops of the larger body, which is not disrupted by it. Indeed, the death of a human may be catastrophic for that human and those of whose lives he is a part, but this my be an unremarkable moment, paralleled by many other deaths, when seen in terms of the \"life\" of a society or nation.\nDeleuze uses the term \"transversal\" in order to help his readers think in terms of \"assemlages.\" The cell is an assemblage in its own right that is absorbed by the larger assemblage of the human, for example: \"...the eukaryotic cell, which one might propose as the base level in a synchronic reading of the human organism, is itself already an organic assemblage according tot he symbiogenesis theory of Lynn Margulis, who proposes evolutionary time scales, the incorporation of mitochondria - previously independent bacteria - into the emergent unity of the eukaryotic cell... social machines intersect technological lineages in roducing 'machinic phyla', or groups of assemblages defined by their affects what they can do and what they can undergo. Thus the horse - man - stirrup assemblage of the steppe nomads also produces a bio-social-technical function unit that is no simple aggregate. These assemblages are territorialized: the triggers of self-organizing behaviour are embedded systematically in a territory. The territorial assemblage interweaves a machinic assemblage of bodies and a collective assemblage of enunciation so that behaviour patterns are reliably triggered given the utterance of 'order words'...A territorial assemblage produces emergent enities 'transverally' among organisms, subjects and technological apparatuses.\"\nA distinction between homeostatratic vs. heterostratic transveral emergence may be formed, in addition to the aforementioned distinction between synchronic and diachronic emergence. An assemblage may be looked at in terms of entities on the same stratum. But this is an arbitrary selection. It may be pragmatically useful but it is not absolutely necessary. One may look at the behavior of cells on a purely microbiological level without looking at their role across strata, for example. Nevetheless, an organic entity will be closely bound up with the inorganic milieus of which they are a part. The same is true of social and technical assemblages. Various categories of emergence may be mixed and matched, as Protevi shows:\n\"Homeostratic synchronic transveral emergence:\na. organic (symbiosis among organisms; ecosystems among groups of organisms)\nb. social (institutions forming a larger entity: colleges forming a university)\nc. technical (e.g., computers and routers forming the internet).\n2. Homeostratic diachronic transveral emergence\na. organic (symbiogenesis: Margulis' theory of the origin of the eukaryotic cell)\nb. social (system change: change of the university from education of elite into a centre for mass vocational training / military-industrial research)\nc. technical (system change: from ARPANET to Internet to world wide web).\n3. Heterostratic synchronic transveral emergence (a bio-social-technical assemblage)\n4. Heterostratic diachronic transveral emergence (mutation and co-evolution of such assemblages in 'machinic phyla').\nOne can move up, down, or diagonal, Protevi notes, \"to the organism or subject.\" Protevi refers to this as a \"political physiology,\" which allows us to examine the various ways intelrocking intensive processes \"articulate the patterns, thresholds, and triggers of emergent bodies, forming assemblages linking the social and the somatic, with sometimes - but not always - the organic or subjective as intermediary. Sometimes we have direct links of the social and the sub-organismic or sub-subjective, as when, for example, American military training embeds 'shoot to kill' reflexes in the spinal cords of GIs, reflexes triggered by the presentation of human-shaped targets in the appropriate 'free fire zone.'\"", "external_links": ["http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/pictures/40000/velka/kaleidoscopic-pattern.jpg", "http://www.protevi.com/john/Emergence.pdf", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_Deleuze"], "published": "2015-10-18T07:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:24:17.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
