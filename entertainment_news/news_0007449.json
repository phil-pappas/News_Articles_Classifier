To celebrate her new project's arrival, the singer surprised the crowd in New York City's Times Square with a mini concert on the same day. Donning a crop top paired with matching pants and a camel-colored coat, the 23-year-old star delivered an acoustic rendition of the album's title track while a couple of musicians playing the trumpet and trombone backed her. A lot of Lovatics in the crowd sang along and cheered as she belted out the lyrics atop a platform. \"Confident\" is the second single to have been released off Lovato's new album, following up \"Cool for the Summer\" which peaked at No. 11 on Billboard Hot 100. Also on Friday, the former Disney darling dropped a new version of Fall Out Boy 's \"Irresistible\" featuring her vocals.
