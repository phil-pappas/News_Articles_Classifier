Fox has a pair \nPress Association 2014 / / National Entertainment News Share \nBack To The Future fans had a very large dose of excitement this week as the day Marty McFly travelled forward to – October 21 2015 – became the present. \nAnd as if that wasn’t enough – Nike went and made fans’ Back To The Future Day by unveiling an ACTUAL pair of self-tying shoes, as sported by Marty in Part II of the trilogy. If you can imagine the future, you can create it.⠀⠀⠀ ⠀Find out about pair no. 1 at https://t.co/ptkErznzjl pic.twitter.com/Gi6UMNsNML \nTo top it all off, Nike gave the first pair to Michael J. Fox, who played Marty in the film all those years ago. \nIn a handwritten letter, legendary Nike shoe designer Tinker Hatfield teased the actor. \nThe note read: “We wanted you to be the first to receive a pair… In addition to your personal pair, we’re creating more pairs for support in aid of the Foundation in 2016.” The letter I received from Tinker today.
