Karl Stefanovic arrives at Sunshine Coast airport all kitted up. john mccutcheon \nOne only hopes that Karl has changed from the short black Adidas running shorts and slightly small sandals and cowboy hat he wore when arriving to a red carpet at the Sunshine Coast Airport. \nThe blue suit Karl wore every morning for an entire year was gone, he said it was \"packed away\" as he embraced the \"warmest welcome from anywhere in the world\". Lisa also appeared amazed as she walked along the carpet to the tunes of the Shake it Up music band. SUPERSTAR WELCOME: Nine's breakfast show hosts Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson arrive at Sunshine Coast Airport. john mccutcheon \nBoth television personalities took the time to be photographed with the young band members and their family in the airport welcome lounge. \nKarl and Lisa were gracious enough to be interviewed twice after problems with audio on the tarmac. \nThey were thrilled to be showcasing the Sunshine Coast for their \"We love Australia Tour\". \nFor Karl, a visit to the region has been a long time coming. \n\"I've been here for 60 Minutes interviews, but it's probably been about 15 to 20 years since I spent the night,\" he said. \nLisa, on the other hand, is a familiar face. \n\"I spent my honeymoon here (to media personality Pete FitzSimons),\" she said. \n\"I try to come back at least once a year.\" \nKarl was hoping to take in a kite surf yesterday afternoon, but with storm clouds brewing and his skills sorely lacking, he admitted it probably wouldn't happen. \nHe was looking forward to enjoying the food from our restaurants and \"catching up with locals\". \n\"The best part of what we do is promoting parts of Australia to Australians,\" he said. \nHe was impressed with how \"green\" the Sunshine Coast was from the air. \nBut then again, he had just travelled from drought-stricken Longreach. \nKarl and Lisa were also challenged with the task of milking a cow from Maleny Dairy in the Hinterland to the beach for an on-air milking session, while Spicers Clovelly chef Cameron Matthews used the best Mooloolaba seafood to cook up a distinctively local breakfast barbecue.
