Rankzoo is the #1 analytics platform for Vine and a go-to source for Vine stats. Collab first created the service as a web application – www.Rankzoo.com – which aggregates data from Vine, giving Viners insight into their channel. It has become a daily destination for Viners to develop their content strategy and track their audience growth. Rankzoo for iOS introduces a fresh look and improved ranking system that combines All Time Loops and All Time Followers into one overall rank. The new system rewards active Viners and the result is a more accurate picture of Vine's top users.\nThe user-friendly mobile app offers users several benefits:\nTrack average Vine performance – Rankzoo crunches billions of data points into key metrics that every Viner should know, allowing Viners to learn their average performance statistics. Increase Loops and Followers – Rankzoo can be used by Viners to gain insight to create more engaging Vines, discover collaboration partners and effectively grow Loops and Followers. Get discovered – As Viners grow their audiences, brands can discover and contact Vine talent with partnership opportunities, helping Viners earn more income and brands to reach new audiences. Key features of the Rankzoo mobile app include:\nFind Top Vine creators – 'Leaderboard' sorting ranks most popular Vine talent based on number of Followers and Loops, allowing a simplified way to see the hottest Viners on the platform. Track Vine Stats – Each Vine profile tracks individual audience growth and displays average post performance (loops, likes, revines, comments, engagement rate). Users can also view a channel's activity in daily, weekly, and monthly increments. Direct Messages – The 'Contact Viner' button allows brands to start discussions with Viners directly in the Rankzoo app. \"Through pure word of mouth, Rankzoo has grown from a simple listing of Vine statistics into an essential resource for the Vine creator community and brands advertising on Vine. We're proud to unveil the completely redesigned Rankzoo app and new, improved ranking system, which makes it easier than ever for Viners to track their audience growth and brands to discover top Vine talent,\" said Tyler McFadden , Co-CEO of Collab.\nRankzoo is free to download today in the App Store.
