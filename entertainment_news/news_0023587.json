Photo / Supplied A man accused of murder after his Tinder date plummeted to her death off his apartment balcony will stand trial. Gable Tostee, 29, was arrested and charged with murder after Kiwi woman Warriena Wright, 26, fell 14 floors to her death from his luxury Surfers Paradise apartment in August 2014. The pair had met through the Tinder dating app just hours earlier. Ms Wright, from Lower Hutt, was in Australia for a wedding at the time. Tostee was due to appear in the Southport Magistrates Court on Thursday, but his lawyer Nick Dore and prosecutors have agreed the case should proceed in the Brisbane Supreme Court, ABC reported. A trial date is yet to be set. Gable Tostee has changed his name via a deed poll to Eric Thomas. Photo / Facebook Tostee has proclaimed his innocence in a series of bizarre posts on social media - with the latest stating he was a victim of \"abuse and violence\" on the night Ms Wright died. \"The irony (and certainly not in any comical sense) is that I dealt with the situation in the least confrontational, least aggressive way after being on the receiving end of a night of abuse and violence. And look where I am now,\" he wrote. He later wrote: \"It is an absolute tragedy for everyone involved, especially Warriena's family. What certainly is no accident though is the deplorable way in which this tragedy has been treated and dealt with.\" Tostee wrote that violence in any form was \"unacceptable\", but he was not one to \"cry double standard\" because men did have a responsibility not to abuse the power of being larger and stronger than women. The post has received a handful of likes, with some Facebook users posting messages of support. \"I'm sorry you're going thru this. And I don't even know you. Tragic accident [sic],\" one person commented. Tostee previously incited a social media storm after stating it was \"sheer lunacy\" he had been charged with murder - in an August post that has since received more than 100 likes. \"It has been almost a year since the tragic incident occurred at my apartment and I don't think I will ever adjust to the nightmarish reality that I wake up to each day,\" he wrote. \"The fact that I was charged with murder after someone attacked me in my own home after refusing to leave then caused their own death by climbing off my balcony is sheer lunacy...It is disturbing and wrong.\" The posts appear on a Facebook page that claims to be controlled by the 29-year-old man, under the name Eric Thomas, which he changed his official name to by deed poll in February. He still appears in court under the name Gable Tostee. Previously in court, prosecutors said Tostee and Ms Wright had spent hours drinking together before a fight broke out and Tostee locked Ms Wright on his 14th floor balcony, the Daily Mail Reported. Prosecutors allege the actions were akin to locking someone in a trunk to suffocate, causing Ms Wright to fear for her life and try and escape. Tostee remains on conditional bail until the trial concludes, ABC reported. In November 2014, Tostee was granted bail, but was ordered to obey strict conditions that prevented him from using the dating app Tinder and drinking or partying into the small hours of the night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:36:34.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
