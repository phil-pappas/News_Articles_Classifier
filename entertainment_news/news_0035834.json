Photo: Simon Schluter \n\"I feel sad. And excited,\" says Daniel Clarke.\nThe CEO of Theatre Works is emotional as he reveals he's leaving the St Kilda venue after five years at the helm.\nClarke, who has transformed the company during his tenure, boosting turnover  by 171 per cent,  will join Arts Centre Melbourne in the role of performing arts programmer.\n\"A big part of my heart has been here for five years, and with all the artists I've worked with, but hopefully I'll get to work with them in different capacities,\" he said on Thursday.\nAdvertisement Clarke will replace Marshall McGuire, who left the Arts Centre to become head of artistic planning at the Melbourne Recital Centre.\nUnder Clarke's direction, Theatre Works has become one of Melbourne's leading independent theatre companies.\nHe established numerous partnerships with prominent arts organisations both locally and overseas including the Melbourne Festival, Melbourne International Comedy Festival and Soho Theatre, and brought out critically acclaimed international works such as Nilaja Sun's No Child , Scottee's The Worst of Scottee​ , and three Bryony Kimmings​ productions including Fake It 'til you Make It , a co-commission with Southbank Centre London.\nHis proudest achievement at Theatre Works is also his most recent – the inaugural Melbourne Directors Lab held as part of the Melbourne Festival. An offshoot of the Lincoln Centre Theatre's Directors Lab in New York, the event saw 40 theatre directors from around Australia participate in masterclasses and discussions over nine days.\n\"It had a really profound effect on everyone involved,\" says Clarke.\n\"Other highlights include being able to increase the amount of money that has gone out of this organisation directly to artists,\" he says.\n\"It's been massive, the turnover for the organisation has gone from $320,000 to $870,000 which is huge.\"\nArts Centre Melbourne programming director Michael Stevens said Clarke's \"fantastically inventive\" programming is what helped him snare the role.\n\"He's a very creative thinker, he's also got a great network of contacts here and overseas,\" said Stevens.\n\"Also his ability to work closely with artists in facilitating and creating work and projects that are of benefit to the industry as well as audiences.\"\nClarke will join an Arts Centre programming team that includes dance programmer Jerry Remkes and performing arts program manager David Anderson.\n\"I don't get a lot of time here [at Theatre Works] to talk about ideas,\" Clarke says \"... it's very doing, it's very delivery-based, I'm looking forward to having a little bit more space to reflect and generate more ideas, and have the support around me to deliver those ideas.\"\n\"I'm excited about the work I'm involved in reaching even bigger audiences hopefully.\"\nClarke has already produced a number of high-profile shows for the Arts Centre including works by Taylor Mac and The Wau Wau Sisters, one of whom is internationally celebrated performance artist Adrienne Truscott (creator of Melbourne International Comedy Festival and Edinburgh Fringe hit Asking For It: A One Woman Comedy About Rape ).\n\"I will definitely stay connected in an advisory capacity to this organisation next year,\" says Clarke.\n\"I feel like I'm leaving the organisation in a really good place, I'm really excited to see who next person is going to be, I think it will attract international people to the role.\n\"Before leaving, the ideal would be to achieve four year-funding through the Australia Council, that's the process we're going through now is putting that strategic plan in place, that would be a great thing to finish up with.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T11:21:05.255+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
