We have soaked up knowledge from mentors, community speakers, vendors, and of course, other entrepreneurs, and used it all to transform ourselves from a fragile startup into a strong and growing company with big plans for the future.\"\nRankedFame, Inc. is a video sharing platform for aspiring talent to gain exposure and recognition on a local and national level. RankedFame's platform brings a new dynamic connection between users and local and national companies through local community support and sponsorships.

RankedFame has come a long way since our inception at the beginning of 2015. Much of our trajectory is owed to the resources, connections, and networking gained through TVE 2 . I know we wouldn't be where we are today without this invaluable startup incubator,\" says Mike Chapman , CEO of RankedFame, Inc.\nTVE 2 is the City of Temecula's business incubator and regional resource center that fosters business growth and economic vitality for entrepreneurs.
