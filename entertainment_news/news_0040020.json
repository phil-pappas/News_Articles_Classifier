Kicking off the parade at the corner of Central Road on Saturday morning, participants traveled west, waving to and performing for cheering observers, finally dispersing at Powhatan Road. The Apple Valley Village Merchants’ Association revived the parade this year after the “tradition for many years kind of fell of,” said Events Manager Angelique Johnson for Signature Events. Along with the town and its Public Works Department, in planning for the parade, Johnson said they wanted to “see if they could bring that piece of history back to the Apple Valley Village and create a positive image for the town.” With more than 50 entries, many with more than 30 participants, the parade drew in attendees of all ages gathering from all across the High Desert. One Victorville resident said it was worth the busy streets and moody weather to attend the parade Saturday. “These are the kind of events that lift your spirits a little,” Anna Smith, 51, said. “It’s nice just to feel that sense of community. I’m glad they brought it back.” Valuing that sense of community, 41-year Apple Valley resident Cliff Earp, a local business owner and Fire Board member, was chosen to serve as the grand marshal for the Happy Trails Parade since “he doesn’t get a whole lot of honors” as he might deserve, Johnson said. One of the largest parade entries was the Apple Valley Little League, bringing 12 teams and more than 100 participants, with tough competition from the Sultana High School Air Force Junior ROTC. A Dancer’s Pointe Performing Arts Center had about 30 young performers dancing through the street, spreading the urge to dance as many attendees joined in. One float decked with a craft Apple Tree was dedicated to the vision of Ursula Poates, one of the town’s first settlers, who has been claimed by some to have named Apple Valley. As the Poates float was announced, the message read in honor of her memory was “This place gave us a place to call home.” Charity Lindsey may be contacted at clindsey@vvdailypress.com or 760-951-6231.
