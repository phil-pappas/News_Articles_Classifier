Ben Murphy is pictured here with performers Stacey Floyd and Morgan Kent. PICTURE: JUSTIN BRIERTY Source: News Limited \nTHE escapes of Houdini, the comedy of Daniels, and the illusions of Copperfield are the inspirations for the work of Ben Murphy launching his show at the Velvet Underground on Wednesday. \nHanging from a straitjacket while trying to escape unaided is just one of the dangerous acts the Melbourne magician will perform in his self-produced two-hour show Illusion Impossible . Ben Murphy is the new illusionist and comedian starting his show at Vertigos at the Casino. PICTURE: JUSTIN BRIERTY Source: News Limited \n“We will do four illusions I’ve never done before, the first time ever performed in Australia,” Murphy said on Friday at the Reef Hotel Casino, where he was rehearsing in full costume – that’s full upside down straitjacketed madness. \nMurphy has an impressive bio – he made Kelly Rowland from Destiny’s Child appear on stage; he has been endorsed by David Copperfield; he has outdone Houdini with his water trick, beating his record of 328 escapes in 70 days. \nHeck, he’s even acted in Neighbours , as drug-dealing Brad Dawson. \nWhat he loves most about his performances in magic is the reaction he gets from the crowd. \n“I love seeing people have a good time – I think we lose things on TV,” Murphy said. \n“I love the moments of laughter and people sitting on the edge of their seats.” \nIllusion Impossible starring Ben Murphy opens on Wednesday at the Velvet Underground at the Reef Hotel Casino at 7pm, doors open at 6.30pm. The show runs until December 23. Book on ticketlink.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:19:59.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
