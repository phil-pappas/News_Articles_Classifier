Seven of the 10 regional councils are in the hunt for one of the three $500 million awards that have been named the “Hunger Games” competition for the popular novels and books.\nThree regions — New York City, Long Island and Buffalo — aren’t eligible for the contest, but can get a piece of the roughly $750 million that is doled out each year from 11 state agencies through the council awards, which will be announced in December.\nThe councils will present their plans from Tuesday, Oct. 20, through Thursday, Oct. 22, to a state panel. The state has allocated nearly $3 billion for about 3,100 projects since Gov. Andrew Cuomo established the councils in 2011.\n“This year’s competition is sure to continue to strengthen and diversify New York’s economic landscape,” Howard Zemsky, Empire State Development president, said in a statement.\nEach council will have 45 minutes to present its plans to the so-called “Strategic Implementation Assessment Team.”\n“The locally-led and driven Regional Economic Development Council process has been instrumental in spurring investment and creating jobs throughout New York State, reinforcing Governor Cuomo’s successful vision of a bottom-up competitive approach for economic growth,” Secretary of State Cesar Perales, who heads the team, said in a statement.\nTo limit the disparity between winners and losers, Cuomo is giving more aid to the regions that don’t win one of the three $500 million awards.\nThe remaining seven regional councils will split the $750 million in available funding, but each region would get between $90 million and $105 million, which is more than they had received in previous years.\nTwitter: @GannettAlbany\nHere’s the council’s presentation schedule:\nTuesday, October 20, 2015\n9:30 a.m. Mid-Hudson Presentation\n11:45 a.m. Capital Region Presentation\n3:00 p.m. Southern Tier Presentation\nWednesday, October 21, 2015\n9:00 a.m. Mohawk Valley Presentation\n11:15 a.m. North Country Presentation\n1:30 p.m. Finger Lakes Presentation\n3:45 p.m. Central NY Presentation\nThursday, October 22, 2015\n9:30 a.m. Western NY Presentation\n11:45 a.m. New York City Presentation\n2:00 p.m. Long Island Presentation", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/GannettAlbany"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:14:40.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
