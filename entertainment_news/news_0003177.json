Read the review to know the fate of the film. Bruce Lee - The Fighter (U/A): Book Your Tickets Right Away! Bruce Lee Story: \nThe story majorly revolves around Kartik (Ram Charan) and his sister(Kriti Karabandha). Rao Ramesh plays a lower middle class father, who can only afford the studies of either of the child. Understanding his father's limitations as well as dreams, Kartik though was a bright student, sacrifices his schooling to see her sister reach her goals. \nWhat else did the young champ do for his family? Did his father understand Karthik's sacrifices? Did Karthik's sister reach her goals? These locks lead the rest of the story. Performances: \nRam Charan has got a role of his age to play, unlike his other films, where he always carry the burden of leading the society on his shoulders. His relaxed body language, naturally gifted style, guileless characterization added the beauty to his role. He was quite emotive in sentimental scenes and he danced like a dream in almost every song. Chiranjeevi takes back all the attention with his 5 minutes role and his screen presence leave you awestruck. \nRakul Preet Singh was good enough for her limited role and she charmed in songs. Kriti, Rao Ramesh, Arun Vijay, Sampath, Tisca, Amitash and Nadhiya excelled even in their minimal screen time. Brahmandam, Posani and Vennala Kishore did not leave any impact. Ali, Jaya Prakash Narayan managed to tickle but were loud most of the times. Technical Aspects: \nIt is understood that director Sreenu Vaitla tried to break the monotony but has somewhere disappointed in delivering what he is expected to offer. The emotional connect was well blended in the plot, which gave a scope for the director to extract wide variety of performances from the actors. \nHowever, mediocre comedy tracks from a 'touted to be a comedy entertainer' and that too coming it from the comedy's care of address Sreenu Vaitla is a let down in itself. Otherwise, Bruce Lee is stuffed with right 'meter' of commercial elements, which will make fans and the masses go bonkers. \nCinematography, Dance choreography and the production values stands out while Thaman deserves a hand down for his massy tracks and powerful back ground scores. Writers Kona Venkat, Gopi Mohan filled the film with their trade mark one liners. Overview: \nSreenu Vaitla's Bruce Lee could rather be called as a 'Mega' offering and we are sure this 'meter' will energize your festive mood with its 'Mega Power' full entertainment.

Bruce Lee Movie Review: MEGA Entertainer 3/9 Anal Arusu \nAnal arusu stylish and grand fights compositions were apt for the hero's characterization and the movie title. Bruce Lee Movie Review: MEGA Entertainer 4/9 Rakul \nRakul looked her best in the film and has complimented the hero very well in funny scenes.
