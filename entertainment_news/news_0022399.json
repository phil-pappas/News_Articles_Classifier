He was welcomed in the most sinful way possible -- with a party, lots of alcohol and even strippers on poles. \nThe welcome party shocked Andre, who had been trying to live a new life as a Christian. He went to his pastor for counsel and also to ask him to baptize him. The pastor said that he would baptize Andre only if he \"cleared his conscience.\" The pastor warned Andre, \"Your house ain't clean if your closets are dirty.\" \nMeanwhile, back at Cookie's Lyon Dynasty record label, her artist Tiana got robbed of her purse. Next thing you know, it seemed like everyone was robbing the new label. Even Lucious sent two robbers to the label to take Cookie's masters. Still, she, along with a new concert promoter she was vetting, Laz Delgado, was able to get them to leave. \nBack at Empire -- or is it Gutter Life Records -- Jamal was preparing to go on tour with Ne-Yo. And while Jamal wanted to bring his boyfriend Michae l on tour with him, his father suggested that he leave his love at home. When Jamal went to Ne-Yo for advice, the R&B singer said, \"It's about what you want.\" So Jamal decided to invite him for the ride. But right when he was about to tell him the good news, he caught him cheating on him with the Rolling Stone photographer -- the same photog who wanted to hook up with Jamal. He sure likes to get around! \nLater, Andre finally got baptized. And the entire family showed up to support him, even Jamal, who didn't want to go to church because of their stance on gays. Lucious also showed up, but when the baptism reminded him of his mother, who also suffered from bipolar depression, he had to get up and leave suddenly. Lucious told his son that if he wanted to run his musical empire he'd have to \"check\" his \"faith at the door.\" He added, \"The only commandments I want followed here are mine.\" \nAnd in an unexpected twist ending, robbers put a bag over Hakeem's head and pushed him into a van. Who did it? Lucious? Someone else? \nWe'll hopefully find out when Empire returns Wednesday at 9 p.m. Eastern on Fox. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:44:58.699+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
