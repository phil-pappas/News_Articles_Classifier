She is divorced with no children and has a new partner named Reggie (Daniel Kaluuya), an Iraq veteran.\nWhen hostage expert Kate and Reggie impress the feds during a raid on a house in Arizona, where the walls are lined with corpses with plastic bags tied over their heads, Kate is asked to “volunteer” for another operation, one run by Matt (Josh Brolin), who may or may not be a CIA “spook,” and a burly, mostly silent and jumpy mystery man named Alejandro (Benicio del Toro), who is known to some as “Medellin.”\nTheir target is Guillermo (Edgar Arreola), a drug lord who is in prison in Juarez, Mexico, where U.S. agencies have — ahem — no jurisdiction and where the local cops are mules and bodyguards. The Americans also go after American Manuel Diaz (Bernardo Saracino), a businessman with a young, growing family. But they really want the barbaric, family-killing, uber-boss Fausto “El Verdugo” (The Undertaker”) Alarcon (Julio Cedillo).\nBouncing back from the too-gimmicky dramas “Prisoners” and “Enemy,” French-Canadian filmmaker Denis Villeneuve (“Incendies”) scores with this powerful crime drama scripted by “Sons of Anarchy” veteran Taylor Sheridan (the studio has already announced a sequel). Like “Traffic,” “Sicario” often features subtitles when characters speak Spanish and tells an intersecting story of a small Mexican family, young father Silvio (Maximiliano Hernandez), who is a policeman, devoted wife and mother (Kim Larrichio) and their soccer-­loving son. Like that house in the opening, the Chandler House of Horrors, as it is dubbed in the news, the secondary plot line adds punch and meaning to the story.\nBlunt is completely credible as Kate. In the supporting cast, Brolin is fun, but also all business. Oscar-winner del Toro brings that imposing but poetic physicality to Alejandro. Victor Garber and Jon Bernthal are both excellent, as usual. Glorious 2-D lensing by brilliant veteran Roger Deakins (“Skyfall”) adds beauty, scope and class to the entire proceeding. Ditto for the music and often scary sound design by Icelander Johann Johannsson (“Theory of Everything,” “Foxcatcher”). Wow.\n(“Sicario” contains profanity, extreme violence and gruesome images.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:57:10.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
