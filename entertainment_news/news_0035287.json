They also know, however, when to put the joking aside and just dance: on pointe, they honour their tongue-in-cheek ballerina names and deliver luscious, precise technique with an uncanny flair that the old masters of Russian ballet would applaud.\nThese two sides of the Trocks house style combined gorgeously in the Odette of Philip Martin-Neilson during the broad-humoured Swan Lake Act II that opened the programme. His Swan Queen was a bit of a secret minx, given to exasperated sideways glances, half-shrugs and glimmers of petulance – nicely camp in accent, but all the funnier for not being over-egged. In a split-second turn, the drollery gave way to seriously pure, expressive dancing, with Odette's solo a tour de force.\nShare article Like Chase Johnsey – the pert and poised ballerina in Le Corsaire pas de deux – or the fire-cracker Kitri of Carlos Hopuy in a rompingly condensed Don Qhixote, Martin-Nielson clearly relishes the challenges, the finesse, the power of burnished pointe-work. As do we, when it is danced by such outstandingly talented ballerinas. Lazlo Major's prowess – not least in scooping Johnsey's ballerina into high lifts in Le Corsaire – was a reminder that the Trocks don't ignore virtuoso masculinity.\nWe'll count the months until they return – lucky Inverness can enjoy all the above and more tomorrow (Friday) night.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-21T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:03:18.323+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
