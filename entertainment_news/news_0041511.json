Most movies don’t get made so I wasn’t scared at all, I was fearless. (Richard Shotwell/Invision) \n“But when it became a reality I had a full body panic attack and was terrified, but I worked through it and realised that is the headspace Laney is always in so maybe I could do this and it was a really great experience.” \nSarah has spoken openly about her own struggles with depression and experiences with therapy and medication and said she drew on this insight for the role as a mother who seems to have it all on the outside. \nShe said: “I had my own relationship with depression that I was able to draw from and use as a resource, as well as a lot of close friends and people who suffered from addiction and have been through detox and had a lot of help.” \nThe actress, who is dating Welsh actor Michael Sheen, said she had to visit some dark places while shooting the movie: “I thought it would be heavy between action and cut and in between we would have a grand old time but it is hard for me to access emotions that are deep, deep in the crevasses of my insides and so they were just on my lap between scenes. \n“It was heavy, I feel weird saying that because there are things much harder than making movies but it was hard.” \nThis foray into serious drama doesn’t mean Sarah is turning her back on comedy and she said she will see what comes her way next.
