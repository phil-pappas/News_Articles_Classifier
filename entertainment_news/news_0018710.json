After revealing to Jimmy Kimmel in September that she threatened to divorce her husband, the actress has changed her strategy by being softer. \"I've asked for physical evidence that he's there, and that not only is he there,\" she told The Huffington Post when talking about her first children's book \"Dear Santa, Love, Rachel Rosenstein\". She continued, \"This is what I asked [Benioff] for: I was like: 'I will not divorce you. All I need is physical evidence that he's there, that he has dialogue and he's not just lying on a funeral pyre, and then I will stay married to you.\" But Benioff still had his lips sealed as Peet shared, \"He just had a horrifying poker face. I don't know if I love him anymore.\" She jokingly added, \"I feel still betrayed. I feel still betrayed as a fan and as a wife.\" Peet, a huge fan of the HBO series, previously said on \" Jimmy Kimmel Live! \", \"I don't love [my husband] anymore. Jon Snow - I said if you kill him, that's it. I'm in the process of getting divorced. I'm not kidding.\" She also admitted that her husband was always super secretive about the show, even to her. \"It's a little bit like being married to someone in the CIA or something, except for not as important,\" she quipped. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com More Game of Thrones News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T06:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:39:35.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
