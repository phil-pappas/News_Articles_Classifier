They can also be placed on hold online at wallawallapubliclibrary.org or call the Library for assistance at 527-4550. Featured books include: Fiction “Less Than Hero,” by S.G. Browne. Browne tackles the superhero genre in this hugely entertaining story of a bunch of regular guys who find out they have rather bizarre powers. These guys probably wouldn’t know each other at all if it weren’t for their unusual way of earning money: doing drug trials for pharmaceutical companies. Over time, it seems that the side effects of the various drugs have mutated our heroes. Now one of them can make other people go into violent convulsions; another can make people throw up; another — the story’s narrator, Lloyd Prescott — can make people fall asleep. But will these admittedly offbeat abilities be enough to stop the unknown villains who are robbing ordinary citizens of their memories and causing them to suffer hallucinations? Can Lloyd reveal his superpower to his girlfriend without causing her to dump him? Will Lloyd ever give up being a guinea pig? It’s fair to say that you’ve never read a superhero story quite like this one; it’s also fair to say that readers who enjoy good, weird fun will love it. BookList “The Theory of Expanded Love,” by Caitlin Hicks. Playwright Hicks’s debut novel spans the latter half of 1963. For 12-year-old narrator Annie Shea, that period’s turbulent events — the election of a new pope, the Equal Pay Act, and J.F.K.’s assassination — reflect and shape the changes taking place in her body and soul. Initially, she’s willing to lie to bolster her family’s reputation as good Catholics, but she gradually awakens to the hypocrisy in the church and in her family life, in which impressing a visiting priest is more important than tending to a screaming baby in a wet diaper, bragging about the number of children one has is more important than cherishing them, and nightly sexual abuse goes unpunished. When one of her 12 siblings is sent to a convent home for unwed mothers, Annie presses her family to live according to the dubious theory they espouse: that with each new life, there will always be more love to go around. Annie’s insistence on truth telling restores connections and strengthens her own resolve to continue to “say what I see — not just what they want me to see.” This worthy debut has a disarming humor. Publishers Weekly “The Wrong Man,” by Kate White. “The Presidents Shadow,” by Brad Meltzer. Nonfiction “The Owl Who Liked Sitting on Caesar: Living with a Tawny Owl,” Martin Windrow. The story of an odd couple: a British military historian and the tawny owl with whom he lived for 15 years. Adorable, but with knife-sharp talons, Mumble became Windrow’s closest, if at times unpredictable, companion, first in a South London flat and later in the more owl-friendly Sussex countryside. Windrow recalls with wry humor their finer moments as well as the reactions of incredulous neighbors, the awkwardness of buying Mumble unskinned rabbit at Harrods Food Hall ... and an unexpected education in the paleontology, zoology and sociology of owl. jacket notes “Smokejumper: A Memoir By One of Americas Most Select Airborne Firefighters,” by Jason Ramos. One select group of men and women are part of America’s front-line defense: smoke jumpers. The smokejumper program operates through both the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. Though they are tremendously skilled and only highly experienced and able wild land firefighters are accepted into the training program, being a smokejumper remains an art that can only be learned on the job. Forest fires often behave in unpredictable ways: spreading almost instantaneously, shooting downhill behind a stiff tail wind, or even flowing like a liquid. In this extraordinarily rare memoir by an active-duty jumper, Jason Ramos takes readers into his exhilarating and dangerous world, explores smoke jumping’s remarkable history, and explains why their services are more essential than ever before. jacket notes Others “Peru: the Cookbook,” by Gastón Acurio. “The Game Believes in You: How Digital Play Can Make Our Kids Smarter,” by Greg Toppo.
