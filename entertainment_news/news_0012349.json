And while the first half of Friday night's performance wasn’t all routine — piano soloist Ingrid Fliter’s mercurial, self-consciously stormy reading of the concerto was quite personal if nothing else — the lack of surprise built into the program seemed to be having a dulling effect on the evening. But then came Beethoven’s symphony after intermission and, suddenly, the music soared.\nGraf is not flashy, but he is a deeply musical conductor, and he has long been one of the DSO’s most reliable guest conductors. Still, this was an exceptionally beautiful, heartfelt performance. Graf shaped a broadly proportioned reading that breathed with natural warmth, elegance, shaded dynamics and flowing dance rhythms. There was always a sense of forward momentum, even in the slow movement. But everything unfolded with graceful patience, even in the swiftest passages of the third movement's peasant dance. The orchestra responded with finely detailed playing, precise and full of passion and nuance. The strings and winds in particular took on a halo glow.\nThe Argentine-born Fliter was going for something different in the Mendelssohn concerto. She seemed to find a license for Sturm und Drang in the work’s initially urgent character and atypical form — the piano enters quickly to start, without the expected orchestral set-up Fine, up to a point. But Fliter's pounding octaves and aggressiveness grew coarse and wearisome. There wasn’t much poetry in the slow movement or joyful glitter in the finale, just a kind of bravura electricity and quick-changing emotionalism. Mendelssohn seemed a bit of an afterthought. (She played with the score in front of her rather than from memory, perhaps indicating the piece was still new to her.)\nFriday's audience felt differently about the performance than I did, rewarding her with a rapturous ovation. Fliter responded with a long encore drawn from Beethoven’s “Tempest” Sonata that for me captured her most rewarding and insightful playing of the night.\nContact Mark Stryker: 313-222-6459. mstryker@freepress.com\nDetroit Symphony Orchestra\nThree stars (out of four stars)\nFriday, Orchestra Hall\nProgram repeats at 8 p.m. tonight, Max M. and Marjorie S.
