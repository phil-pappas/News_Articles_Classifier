New documents in a civil lawsuit filed by Brown's family say Whitney Houston' s 22-year-old daughter went into the months-long coma that preceded her death after Gordon injected her with a \"toxic mixture\" and placed her unconscious in a bathtub. The suit accuses Gordon of assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and transferring money from her account into his without authorization. \nBrown \"died following a particularly violent altercation with [Gordon] that left her battered and bruised, with a tooth knocked out,\" reads the suit.
