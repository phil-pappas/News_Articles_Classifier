It will be held on Tuesday evening. The surprising announcement was made nearly a hour after the cricketing body called off the meet due to the hooliganism shown by Shiv Sena. \nThe meet was originally scheduled to take place in the BCCI headquarters in Mumbai. However, the intimidation shown by the extreme-right outfit forced the authorities to change the venue. PCB president Shahryar Khan along with executive committee head Najam Sethi are expected to reach the Indian national capital by tomorrow. From the BCCI, newly appointed chief Shashank Manohar and secretary Anurag Thakur will meet the officials of PCB.

According to reports, PCB will demand BCCI to allow Indian players to participate in domestic leagues in the neighbnouring countries, along with restarting annual bilateral series between the two countries. \nTo counter the anti-Pakistan propaganda of Shiv Sena, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has offered to host the meeting in the state capital of Kolkata under a fully secure environment. “Hearing about incidents related to disruption of BCCI work in Mumbai. Cricket Board is welcomed to meet in Kolkata,” Banerjee said. \n  2:37 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T12:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:49:23.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
