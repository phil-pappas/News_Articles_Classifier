Many of you spruced up summer-tiered landscapes, welcoming the throngs of visitors to the once in a lifetime exhibition. The night of the Monet soiree people were stopping me on the street and in the parking garage, to ask, what was all the commotion at the Jepson Center? Indeed this exhibition has hit big.\nThe Garden Guru however is here to talk flower power. Monet said, “I must have flowers always and always,” so it is time to plant cool season color. Monet did love pansies and violas and we are blessed to have artist-like mixes that he would have no doubt loved.\nThe first I want to suggest to you actually bears his name. It is the Monet Mix in the Delta series. The Delta series is a large flowered pansy that has stood the test of time in performance has become one of the most loved series in the Lowcountry.\nThe Monet mix has just the right amount of yellow combined with shades of lavender, burgundy and touches of blue. These are the colors Monet liked and will cause visitors to become fixated on their beauty. Obviously the visitors I am referring to are those coming to see the wonderful Monet paintings. But it is also friends and relatives coming to your home for Thanksgiving. Monet though would not just have planted the pansies, but would have incorporated spring bulbs like daffodils or tulips to give that final floral crescendo just prior to the warm season transition next spring.\nAnother touch of artistry has occurred with the design of the Coastal Sunrise mix is in the Matrix series. The Matrix series hasn’t been around nearly as long as the Deltas, but they have already sky rocketed in popularity and for several good reasons.\nFirst they load up with large colorful flowers. For those of you who think bigger is better, and especially when it comes to pansies, the matrix series is for you. Secondly, they branch quickly giving you an even more colorful show because of the sheer number of flowers you have as they reach a height nearing 8 inches with an equal spread. They have short stems able to support the large flowers and they are resistant to stretching with warmer temperatures.\nAll of that would certainly make you want to plant Matrix pansies but then when you see the Coastal Sunrise mix your jaw will drop. I am a pretty good color combination guy, but I promise whoever came up with this mix certainly deserves some accolades. When you look at a planting, you’ll see rich colors that include shades of blue, rose, peach and creamy yellow.\nLastly consider the Ocean Breeze mix. This is made up of various shades of blue, lavender and white. You will find this design not only in the Matrix series or pansies but the Sorbet series of violas. Either one will give you a dazzling flower performance until April.\nI have already mentioned Monet would have included inter-planting unseen bulbs, but he no doubt would have also partnered the pansies and violas with dianthus. The dianthus he would have chosen would be carnations. Carnations famous as cut flowers and corsages with a spicy fragrance don’t do so well for us.\nOn the other hand, dianthus like the Amazon series which was the cut flower of the year for the United States and the Bouquet series known as a cut and come again type dianthus, will do incredibly well here and make the perfect pansy pal. Both are considered interspecific hybrids and are award-winners in the South.\nAmazon will produce large stalks of flowers reaching 2-feet tall while the Bouquet series will top out slightly shorter. In the Bouquet series you will find a purple, a rose and a bi-colored rose magic. In the Amazon series there is a cherry, a rich colored neon duo and a similar rose-magic. Grow these this year and you’ll wonder where in the world they have been. Look also for the Telstar, Dash and Jolt dianthus as well.\nThe main thing is to plant cool season flowers. Do so for your own enjoyment, so that you can be the artistic Monet of your garden. But do so to also welcome the thousands of visitors coming to our city.\nCheck your local garden center for the Spirit of Monet Collection of Flowers.\nToday is the Autumn Gardenfest at the Coastal Georgia Botanical Gardens from 9 a.m. until 3 p.m. and many of the local garden centers will be exhibiting there.\nNorman Winter is the director of the Coastal Georgia Botanical Gardens at the Historic Bamboo Farm, University of Georgia Cooperative Extension.
