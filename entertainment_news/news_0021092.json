Season 6 opened with a plan to rid the area of a quarry full of Walkers. A group of maybe 20 was poised to enact the plan, which started abruptly. Rick voiced the “insane” line and off we went. The 90-minute premiere of “The Walking Dead” featured two storylines. One was directly after Season 5 and set in stylish black and white. The other, in living color, was the plan as it unfolded outside the walls of Alexandria until it went sour in the last two minutes. In black and white, Rick and Morgan disposed of Pete’s body, as Deanna wouldn’t allow him to be buried on Alexandrian soil next to her departed husband. Rick said murderers didn’t deserve proper burials. Morgan smartly and accurately pointed out that many people are killers in this world, including him and Rick. They discovered the Walker quarry while burying Pete. Thousands of Walkers meandered in the quarry, which was bookended by two semis blocking their paths. They were too neatly “placed there” they noted, but it didn’t matter. They would quickly become a problem for Alexandria, hence Rick’s “insane” plan to move them like cattle only not as tasty. A new face, Heath, mentioned it appeared a small group barricaded themselves in the quarry, thinking it would be a safe haven (we know what happens to safe havens, don’t we?). They didn’t survive, however, and the subsequent noise from their turned carcasses drew more and more Walkers. Rick said one of the trucks would fall off the ledge any day and it did, which started the plan in earnest. Rick wanted the Walkers to go West like Lewis and Clark. East would be toward Alexandria, which is bad news. All the while, Carter (Rusty Griswold) questioned Rick on everything from the plan to killing Pete to his choices for breakfast. Back in color, Daryl and Sasha played pace cars for the Walker 500. Meantime, Abraham had an unscheduled workout after leaving the car, killing some “straggling Walkers” and returning with a blood-soaked shirt. Sasha then questioned his sanity (which he did before with her … more on that below). Back in black, Rick forced Carter and a group of Alexandrians to take out some stray Walkers. They failed, which was expected. Earlier, Rick told Morgan that no one from the town was equipped to survive and if they didn’t learn quickly then they’d be dead. That’s not Rick’s concern, however. He’s more concerned with the strongest people for the future of the community. That’s a smart concern. The weak will only get others killed (see Nicholas, Gabriel and Carter). Page 2 of 3 - “They’re going to die no matter what,” Rick told Morgan in a flashback. Morgan agreed, but later showed that even if he’s resigned to live in this world as it is he’s still not without compassion. Rick might be devoid of some of that compassion and it played out later with Carter. That’s likely to cause the friction between Morgan and Rick in the future. Morgan said Rick was the same man he met in his house all those days ago. He said Rick was the same man who pulled him off the ledge when he went to Crazy Town. Will he feel that way in the next few weeks? Morgan also has other concerns currently, as does everyone else in Alexandria. The plan was working perfectly until a horn blared from the distance. This led the Walkers toward Alexandria. Next week is not going to be fun. Quick thoughts: Walkerpalooza started the show, as we opened at 100 MPH. The middle part of the episode slowed considerably while we learned the backstory before the plan. This premiere couldn’t be as powerful as Season 5 given the circumstances, but it did enough right to work. Like last year, this season is going to take a lot out of us… Who was blowing the horn? Was it The Wolves? That’s a reasonable pick, given their propensity for chaos. That said, it’s unlikely they were aware of the plan. That could mean someone from Alexandria did it, which would be even worse… Abraham questioned Sasha’s sanity while they piloted a vehicle in the plan. Sasha quipped about Abraham still choosing to ride with her if he thought she was suicidal. That shut him up a bit… Later he went to grab the bull by the “testicles.” Sasha, who still uses her turn signals was perturbed he messed with the rearview mirror. What’s worse? Suicidal thoughts or OCD?... Speaking of OCD, Morgan was still upset over Michonne stealing a protein bar when they last met. Cue “Frozen” let it go, let it go… Walker kill of the week: When one smashed its head on the metal wall. Another playfully rubbed its face on the fence and took a nap. Both were trampled at Marshall and Redding, which was not the place to be on Sunday… Nicholas might be a cat. He’s so far been saved twice by Glenn, make that three times, as Glenn blasted a Walker that was coming to chomp. Maggie said Glenn told her she could rat out Nicholas for the woods incident last season, but she chose not to do so. I question the reasoning… Page 3 of 3 - Carter also found himself in a bad situation, as his plan to kill Rick backfired. Rick asked Carter to work with the group to survive instead of killing him. It was an obvious choice, but Carter won’t be the only one to question Rick soon… Carter won’t be doing the questioning after a Walker dined on his face. His screaming briefly changed the direction of the Walkers. His screaming stopped when Rick stabbed him in the head. Morgan and Michonne looked on and begrudgingly agreed on the course of action… Rick and Jessie had a “moment.” Rick’s not getting cozy with her anytime soon… Carl was largely missing this episode. He was likely making out or playing video games, or both… Tara is finally awake. She’ll wish she were sleeping next week…", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T11:24:27.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
