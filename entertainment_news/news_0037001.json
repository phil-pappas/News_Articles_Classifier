Hoffman is the only resident of the Upstate. \nThe members get together a few dozen times a year to perform as the Chamber Players. In addition to Hoffman on viola, the group includes violinist Joanna Maurer, flutist Sara Stern, cellist Stephen Balderston and pianist Anna Stoytcheva. \n“We love playing together, and we really enjoy each other’s company,” Hoffman said. “I always feel so thrilled and privileged to play with the other members of the group because they’re remarkable musicians and such wonderful people.” \nThe group particularly relishes an opportunity to return to the Temple of Israel. \n“The acoustics there are just great,” Hoffman said. \nThe ensemble’s program Sunday also will include the Trio in C Major for flute, violin and cello (“London” Trio No. 1) by Joseph Haydn. \n“It’s absolutely charming,” Hoffman said. \nAlso featured will be the Trio in G Minor for flute, cello and piano by Carl Maria von Weber. \n“It’s one of Weber’s top-notch chamber music pieces,” Hoffman said. \nIn addition to performing, Hoffman is a prominent radio commentator. He hosts the national radio broadcasts of “Chamber Music From the Spoleto Festival USA,” carried locally on South Carolina’s public radio stations. His “A Minute With Miles,” offering insights into classical music, is a three-time daily feature on South Carolina public radio as well. \nHoffman also is a music commentator for National Public Radio’s flagship news program, “Morning Edition.” \nFor the latest in local arts news and reviews, follow Paul Hyde on Facebook and Twitter: @PaulHyde7. \nYOU CAN GO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T02:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:45:04.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
