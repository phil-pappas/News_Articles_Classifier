SeaWorld to challenge California ban on orca breeding FILE - In this Nov. 30, 2006, file photo, people watch through the glass as a killer whale passes by while swimming in a display tank at SeaWorld in San Diego. SeaWorld marine park in San Diego will challenge a state commission ruling than banned the company from breeding its captive killer whales. The announcement on Thursday, Oct. 15, comes a week after the California Coastal Commission endorsed a $100 million expansion of the tanks SeaWorld uses to hold orcas in San Diego.
