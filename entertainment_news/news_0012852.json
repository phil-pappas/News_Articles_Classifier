The a capella group made up of Avi Kaplan, Scott Hoying, Kevin Olusola, Mitch Grassi and Kirstie Maldonado also gave their fans the music video for one of its cuts called \"Sing\" on the same day. The Pentatonix members are seen filming themselves as they stroll around the town. They also get some help from their fans and famous friends for the clip. Some familiar faces from actresses Victoria Justice and Maisie Williams to YouTube stars like Tyler Oakley and Grace Helbig are spotted singing along to the track. The \" Pentatonix \" album marks the group's first to mostly feature original tracks. Their and Jason Derulo 's take on Shai's \"If I Ever Fall in Love\" is the only cover song on the project. \"We built a following doing covers of songs our fans had already memorized. So the challenge was to take our established sound and create tunes that they've never heard before and make them so memorable that within a few listens, they're familiar to them,\" Hoying recently explained the difficult part of doing the album. \"But we felt it was time to get progressive and move outside our usual comfort zone while keeping the integrity of our core sound,\" he continued. \"We really wanted to prove we have something to say and be original artists. Original material is virtually unheard of for an a capella group, and we're really excited about it.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T09:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T21:48:53.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
