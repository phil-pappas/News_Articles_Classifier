Dolloff Auditorium of Medomak Valley High School, Manktown Road. Performances will be Thursdays through Saturdays at 7 p.m. through Nov. 14; plus a single 2 p.m. matinee Sunday, Nov. 8. \nMore than 50 students on or back stage, have been rehearsing six days a week to bring the iconic story to life. Their goal is a production that aims to have theatergoers laugh, cry and maybe even be a bit scared. All are invited to come support the students’ annual musical. \nTickets at the door are $10, $8 for those younger than 18. During the first three weeks of November, at least six high schools in Knox and Waldo counties will present their biggest theatrical productions of the school year; see the A&E Briefs on page CXX for what’s coming up. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
