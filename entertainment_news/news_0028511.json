Charles Sykes/Charles Sykes/Invision/AP Abel Tesfaye, known by his stage name the Weeknd, finally explained his hairstyle in an interview with Rolling Stone magazine. Previous Next Enlarge \nThe Weeknd finally answered the one question about him that has puzzled most of the world: what is up with the hair? \nThe alternative R&B artist, 25, (real name Abel Tesfaye) revealed the true intention behind his dread-locked mane in a cover story for Rolling Stone . \nDrawing inspiration from the late Jean-Michel Baquiat, he says the purpose for the edgy look is to stand out. \n\"I want to be remembered as iconic and different,\" he told the music magazine. \"So I was like, 'F--k it, I'm gonna let my hair just be what it wants.'\" Adding, \"I'll probably cut it if it starts interfering with my sight. I can kind of see it right now. But if I cut it, I'd look like everyone else. And that's just so boring to me.\" \nThe writer described the Toronto native's hair as having \"its own distinct personality\" — the front portion is similar to a “flopped-over moose antler,” while the back resembles a “tiny octopus.” Maintaining the look requires \"just a hard shampoo every once in a while.\" A photo posted by The Weeknd (@abelxo) on Oct 21, 2015 at 9:40am PDT \nThe Weeknd recalled meeting Taylor Swift for the first time at Sam Smith's Grammy party — and the pop singer couldn't stop touching his hair. \n\"But the whole time she was talking, she was kind of, like, petting my hair?\" he said. \"I think she was drawn to it — she must have been gone off a few drinks.\" \nFaced with the decision of bringing up the awkwardness of the situation, he decided to allow Swift to continue. \n\"I'm not going to be like, 'Hey, can you stop?' I mean, it felt good! But when she started petting my hair, that's when I was like, 'I definitely need a drink.'\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T21:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:59:27.742+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
