Comment Posted Oct. 14, 2015 at 9:28 am Updated at 9:43 AM NORTH KINGSTOWN, R.I. -- Robert Leuci, the onetime crooked New York policeman who became an informer and, later, a Rhode Island author, died Monday at his Saunderstown home, The New York Times reported. He was 75. Leuci -- writer of six novels, a memoir, a play, short stories and screenplays -- was teaching at the University of Rhode Island, in South Kingstown. But most famously, he was the subject of the 1978 book \"Prince of the City,\" which chronicled his decision to expose the corruption inside New York's Police Department. The Providence Journal's Andy Smith profiled Leuci in a story published in May. Here it is: Once N.Y.'s 'Prince of the City,' Robert Leuci found true calling as writer in R.I. By Andy Smith Journal Arts Writer Posted May. 3, 2015 @ 12:01 am SOUTH KINGSTOWN, R.I. — Robert Leuci is 75 now, an adjunct professor teaching writing at the University of Rhode Island. He's written six novels, a memoir, a play, short stories, screenplays. He hasn't been a New York City cop since 1981. But for some, he'll always be the Prince of the City, the corrupt cop who ultimately decided to expose the rot within law enforcement. In 1978, retired New York Deputy Commissioner Robert Daley told Leuci's story in his book \"Prince of the City.\" In 1981, Sidney Lumet adapted the book into a movie of the same title, starring Treat Williams. Leuci wrote his own memoir, \"All the Centurions,\" in 2004. He looks back at his former self with mixed emotions, at best: \"I have no respect for that character,\" he said. \"There's no excuse for some of the things I did in those days ... I have five grandchildren now. They're going to read about the guy who was a corrupt cop in his day.\" But Leuci identifies not as a cop, or an ex-cop, but as as a writer. He's got a story in a new collection, edited by Rhode Island writer Ann Hood, called \"Providence Noir,\" which also includes contributions from Luanne Rice, Peter Farrelly, Elizabeth Strout, Dr. Pablo Rodriguez, Thomas Cobb and more. Leuci's story, \"The Vengeance Taker, \" is set in Olneyville — \"It's like writing about old Brooklyn\" — and centers around a girl whose parents are blown up by a car bomb. She sets out for revenge, and doesn't let scruples stand in her way. \"In my experience, victims of serious crimes go one of two ways. Either they become afraid of everything, or they become vengeance takers,\" Leuci said. Interviewed last week in the URI conference room where he teaches classes, Leuci said he tries to write at least a page a day, every day. \"You have to write if you're going to think of yourself as a writer ... I don't care what you do, if you're a gas station attendant, if you're a writer you see the world from a different place.\" One of his short stories, \"Killer Overhead,\" has been adapted into a film titled \"A Killer Serve\" by URI student Andrew Pilkington, a remarkable story in his own right. Pilkington has cerebral palsy and types with his nose and toes. Partially set at the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Leuci's story is about a retired hit man whose old boss asks him for a favor. The boss's daughter is married to a tennis pro who may be abusing her. The boss asks the hit man to check it out, and the consequences aren't pretty. \"He's an amazing kid,\" Leuci said of Pilkington. \"His movie was very, very good, and his next couple of movies will get better and better.\" Pilkington made the movie independently after graduating from URI in 2014, raising money through the funding website Indiegogo and private contributions. Pilkington said he has submitted the movie to a number of film festivals and is waiting to hear back. Leuci said he's working on an anthology of short stories that will combine fresh work with pieces that have already been published. He'll also be teaching sessions on screenwriting at the upcoming Ocean State Summer Writing Conference from June 18-20 at URI. Leuci, who grew up in a Jewish/Italian neighborhood in Queens, said he always wanted to be a writer, and applied for jobs on newspapers in New York before joining the New York City police force. An early friend and mentor was acclaimed writer Robert Stone, winner of the National Book Award for \"Dog Soldiers.\" Stone died in January, and Leuci wrote a tribute for the Ocean State Review, a literary journal published by URI. Leuci said he met Stone at a writers' conference in 1982 and the two formed a bond. \"In his books, characters come to crucible, and have to deal with it. That's what's interesting to me. It was part of my life, a big part of my life. I made some terrible mistakes,\" Leuci said. Leuci may have left the police force long ago, but most of his writing takes place in the world of cops and crime. \"I've never been good with heroes,\" he said. \"I like to write about inner-city people, people in trouble ... there will always be a crime of some sort. I don't know if I could write a straight love story.\" Leuci came to Rhode Island in 1989, when he was looking to move closer to his former wife and children. He was considering houses in Connecticut when his real estate agent mentioned she had a house in Saunderstown that Leuci could stay at for a few months. \"It was fantastic. I never wanted to leave,\" Leuci said. So he's still living in Saunderstown — although not at his realtor's house. Although Leuci has set scenes from his novels, and some of his short stories, in Rhode Island, he hasn't yet put a full novel here. \"Providence is an interesting city, a complicated city, but it's not my home,\" he said. \"Old Brooklyn was, but that Brooklyn doesn't exist anymore.\" Leuci worked in Brooklyn when on the New York police force. Leuci said he's looking forward to the URI writers' conference, where he'll discuss screenwriting. He's seen screenwriting from a lot of angles. He's been the subject of a screenplay in \"Prince of the City,\" wrote an episode of \"100 Centre Street\" that was broadcast on the Arts & Entertainment Network, saw Andrew Pilkington make a movie from one of his short stories. Leuci also knows from experience how hard it can be in Hollywood to get a screenplay from the page onto the screen. He wrote a screenplay for his novel \"The Fence-Jumpers,\" which was optioned by Michael Corrente and set to star David Caruso, but it never got made. Three screenwriters, including Leuci, took a crack at his novel \"Captain Butterfly\" only to see that project stall as well. One of the trickiest things about screenwriting, Leuci said, is that it's very difficult to show someone thinking, so almost everything has to be conveyed through action or dialogue. \"It's a visual art, so to get it from your head onto a screen can be very difficult,\" he said. \"First you need to sit and think about what story you want to tell. If it doesn't interest you, it won't interest anyone else.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:35:22.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
