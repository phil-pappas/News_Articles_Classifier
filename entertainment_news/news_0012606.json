However, both its director Sarah Gavron and producer Alison Owen (“Elizabeth,” “Brick Lane,” “Proof,” “Shaun of the Dead”) will be on hand to discuss this landmark docudrama with the audience afterward. “Suffragette” screens at 7:30 p.m. Oct. 24 at Trustees Theater. The show is sold out, but a small number of unclaimed $10 tickets are sometimes available to those willing to wait in the standby line.\nHow did you first become interested in making this picture?\nOwen: I saw a BBC series when I was growing up called “Shoulder to Shoulder” that was about the Pankhursts, an aristocratic family that were very involved with the Suffragettes, and I was curious about the working women that were their followers, and why no one seemed to know much about them.\nI also wanted to make sure my daughters knew about the history of the Suffragettes, because I felt like a lot of young people are unaware of how recently womens’ rights were gained, and how fragile they are and how hard fought.\nIt took almost five years to bring to the screen. Did you know it would take so long to come to fruition?\nOwen: There were unexpected challenges. It took quite a while to get the script right, because there was an enormous amount of research to do. And history as a whole has not served women very well, and particularly working class women.\nWe had to sift through a great deal of memoirs and diaries and scraps of facts in archives ... for our writer, Abi Morgan, to create the character of Maud, which is a composite character made up from the accounts of a number of different working class women of the time.\nWhat sort of hindrances had to be overcome for this film to be greenlit?\nOwen: There was always support for making the movie, but the financial types expected us to make a smaller, more intimate “arthouse” film, and our interest in painting on a very wide canvas and wanting to really heroicize these women and commemorate them for the heroines they were took a lot more time.\nWe wanted to show the riots, the bombings, the forced feedings and the imprisonments — all the things they went through to try and achieve their cause.\nThis film was produced, written, directed by and stars a largely female cast and crew. Was that in itself a major hindrance?\nOwen: There were pluses and minuses to that. On the one hand, because people felt passionately about the subject, we had amazing creativity in terms of the heads of the production design and wardrobe departments.\nThere were a lot of women working together at all hours pouring all their energy into making a film about a subject they felt so strongly about.\nOn the other hand, when we started on this six years ago, the subject was still considered a little “wordy” and “preachy.” They feared no one would be interested in a sort of didactic history lesson ...\nIt’s created so much more of a Zeitgeist, and we’re glad that our film has happened to land in this feminist moment.\nWe hope that if our film is successful, that it will make it easier for other women to make movies.\nAre you looking forward to the festival?\nOwen: I adore Savannah. I think this is my fourth time attending the festival. I came there once and fell completely in love with the city. I try and make it every year and I am very happy that I am bringing a movie this time.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14824523.jpg", "https://bit.ly/ZyZ8mc)", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14824522.jpg", "https://bit.ly/ZyZaur", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14824523.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14824522.jpg", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dosavannah/id626862925?ls=1&mt=8", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hr.apps.n53744379", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://i.imgur.com/2Ix6dHF.png", "https://bit.ly/Ke006c"], "published": "2015-10-22T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:07:46.202+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
