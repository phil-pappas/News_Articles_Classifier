Before she sets out, ethereal singer Florence Welch talks about Taylor Swift, Sons of Anarchy and new songs:\n1. Fashion takes priority in her suitcase. The Brit is known for wearing flowing blouses and spectacular hats, but she admits her wardrobe isn't always practical. \"I'll bring all the paisley in the world and all kinds of flouncy waistcoats, but I'll always forget something really crucial,\" says Welch. \"I'll never have my bank card; I always have to buy a toothbrush and toothpaste wherever I am. I'll have this frock coat I bought in a vintage store, but I don't have a phone charger.\"\nUSA TODAY\nFlorence + the Machine embarks on U.S. tour\n2. 'Third Eye' is sure to be a tour highlight. The uplifting track is off third album How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful , released in June. \"We haven't really played it in the U.S. yet,\" Welch says. \"That's a song I wrote just kind of by hitting the walls and playing the piano.\" With a message that everyone deserves love and to be loved, \"I thought I was writing it for someone else, but I realized how much I was trying to write it for myself, too. You don't really realize how you're trying to give yourself a message in a song.\"\n3. She would love to stop by Taylor Swift's tour. Welch is a longtime friend of the pop star and tries to see her whenever she's stateside. Maybe she could stop by Swift's star-studded 1989 tour for a night? \"Our schedules haven't crossed over enough, but I'd obviously love to perform,\" Welch says. \"Mainly, I just want to see the show. I'm sad I haven't been able to yet, but I really want to.\" If she does, maybe they could duet on Shake It Off , Welch's favorite 1989 track. \"It just makes me so happy,\" she says.\n4. More acoustic gigs aren't out of the question. After breaking her right foot at Coachella this spring, Welch played some seated shows with minimal backing from her band. Although it was out of necessity, because of the clunky boot she wore as she healed, \"I'd love to do a tour like that, actually,\" Welch says. \"But the thing is, I'm so excitable and I don't know if I'd have to be injured (to do it). Dance is such a big part of my life, I really have to commit to doing a stripped-down, not-as-much-movement kind of show, because I'm just so impulsive.\"\n5. Yes, she binge-watches TV, too. \"I just finished Breaking Bad and started Sons of Anarchy . I feel like it's going to be pretty absorbing,\" Welch says. On the road, \"I read a lot and do a lot of journaling, and I like to run. I'm pretty good at being on my own and keeping myself busy. If you give me a hotel room and some clothes to throw around and some books to read, I can be pretty happy on my own, for like, two days.\"\n6 CONNECT 35 TWEET LINKEDIN //usat.ly/1RruiFe TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RruiFe&text=5%20things%20to%20know%20about%20Florence%20Welch%20on%20tour&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/177d9bf2227450c9d4a96dc5576d4659f1af27f4/c=104-192-1587-2170&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635796334944824996-GTY-475792962-73519407.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b2e9b23cd767d8a10443c055f0220c24d0200e88/r=266x400/local/-/media/2015/10/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635796334944824996-GTY-475792962-73519407.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/01cd0804b379b6bc28a064666c836e04c8ce0222/c=921-804-3081-2964/local/-/media/2015/10/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/635792981098385727-rsz-florence-the-machine.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RruiFe&mini=true", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/B9v8jLBrvug?feature=oembed", "http://usat.ly/1RruiFe", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635796334944824996-GTY-475792962-73519407.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-06T02:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:35:26.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
