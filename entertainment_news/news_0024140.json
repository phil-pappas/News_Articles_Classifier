Khloe has been with Lamar the whole time and strongly believes in his recovery. \nCaitlyn Jenner, then Bruce Jenner played a very important role as a father during Khloe's wedding to Lamar. Having always been such a prominent figure in their relationship, it's quite surprising to know that she has pulled herself away from the issue. \nOne of the reasons behind Caitlyn's this sort of a behavior towards Lamar could be the clash she has with Khloe regarding the statement she had made about Kris Jenner in the Vanity Fair interview. \nCaitlyn looked utterly stunning at the movie theater premises in her skinny pants, a bling top, clutch in the hand and nails well painted in red! \nDidn't seem like Lamar's critical medical condition matters to her one bit or she might be refraining herself from making any comments post her clash with Khloe. \nWhile Caitlyn was enjoying her movie time with her new bestie and assistant, the rest of the Kardashians dropped all the work they were involved with and rushed to the hospital upon hearing Lamar's improvement. \n''As a family we've decided to hold off on publishing content across our apps while we continue to support and pray for Lamar,'' they said. ''Thank you for your kindness and understanding during this difficult time. \" \nWe can only wait till the new season of KUWTK is aired to see if the family really stopped the camera from rolling all the life and death drama. And ohh, also, if we could get a glimpse of make up free Kardashians in the hospital at least!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:49:58.496+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
