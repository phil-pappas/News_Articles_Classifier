In the classic 80s film Marty McFly and Doc Brown travel to the future and arrive on October 21, 2015. So did we live up to the film's technological expectations?\nPT1M16S http://www.canberratimes.com.au/action/externalEmbeddedPlayer?id=d-44vu4 620 349 October 21, 2015 Autoplay On Off Video feedback Video settings More The Big Picture columns Movie session times Full movies coverage Read the review from 1989 The future ain't what it used to be. You may have noticed that it is 30 years since Back to the Future , one of the seminal 1980s movies for people aged about 35 to 40, was released. It was seminal partly because it painted a picture of what the future might hold for them. It was by no means guaranteed rosy, which must have been hard if you were still sucking your thumb. Still, it had its upside. Ronald Reagan was US President and he thought it was terrific, probably because it mentioned him. He didn't mind that the joke was on him.\nIn Part 2, from 1989, Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) and his mad inventor pal Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) took their DeLorean DMC-12 sports car/time machine forward to October 21, 2015, at 4.29pm. So, how did it do?\nAre you telling me you still have to tie your own shoelaces?: Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) would find the real 2015 rather familiar, and sadly disappointing. \nAmong the things the movie foretold that we still don't have are: self-tying shoelaces, although a number of companies have tried; flying cars, although that might be close; a justice system without lawyers; jackets that shrink to fit whoever is wearing them; and a movie called Jaws 19 , which was playing in the local cinema when they landed back in Hill Valley, California – otherwise known as the back lot at Universal Studios. \nAdvertisement Among the things they got right: great big flat screens with multiple channels, so we can watch 10 channels at once (yay!) and voice-controlled home appliances. One of the silliest was that businessmen would be wearing two ties. Together.\n \nAll I need to do is get her up to 88mph, and look out tomorrow, here we come. \n\nTo be fair, Robert Zemeckis, who directed, and Bob Gale, who co-wrote all three movies, never set out to make informed guesses about the future. Zemeckis thought prediction was a mug's game, so he just tried to make it funny. Fans might take these things seriously, but the filmmakers didn't. There's a lot of speculation on the internet around the speed the DeLorean had to reach to break out of real time: 88mph (141.6kph). Boys who are now scientists have advanced a series of complicated theories. According to Bob Gale, it was just a nice memorable number. And given that a DeLorean speedometer only went to 85mph, it justified the extra speedo on the dashboard of the modified car.\nThe first film opened in the US in July 1985 and became the top grossing film of the year. It enjoys cult status for the generation that's now reaching the age of disappointment – the moment when you learn that everything is not possible, that you can't always do it, even if you want it bad. \nEverybody's got one of these, right?: Michael J. Fox with a hoverboard in Back to the Future Part II . \nThe movie contained that idea but it was easy to ignore if you were a kid. They just saw a film in which everything was fun, exciting and possible. Kids loved the fact that Marty McFly outsmarted the 1955 school bully Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) by getting away on a skateboard. They adored the stainless-steel car and the flaming tracks it left on the road. The mad professor antics of Christopher Lloyd, bug-eyed and white-haired and shouting, made them laugh. They especially loved the truck that tipped a load of manure on Biff and his henchmen (who included a then unknown Billy Zane).\nThere was a darker side that may have appealed to older viewers, although it's way creepy. In the first movie, Marty returns to 1955 to discover his soon-to-become father George (Crispin Glover) is a nerdy peeping Tom, climbing a tree to get a look at his soon-to-be mother, Lorraine Baines (Lea Thompson), in her underwear. After an accident, Marty wakes up in Lorraine's bed, minus his trousers. She has put him to bed. She thinks his name is Calvin Klein. \"It's written all over your shorts,\" she says, looking at him with sweet and carnal eyes.\nLater, she throws herself at Marty and kisses him on the mouth. It's an odd sort of comedy for a mainstream American movie in 1985. \"Are you trying to tell me my mother has the hots for me…?\" Marty asks the more observant Doc Brown.\nThe appeal of an alternate reality is universal, but it has a particular resonance for post-war Americans. It's a Wonderful Life , Frank Capra's classic from 1946, became a beloved national institution, partly because it was shown every Christmas Day on television. It tells the story of George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart), who tries to jump off a bridge after losing his family fortune. An angel (Henry Travers) saves him by showing him what Bedford Falls, his peaceful home town, would have become if he had not lived. Renamed Pottersville, it's an inferno governed by greed and lust. George returns to the loving arms of his wife (Donna Reed) and Pottersville is prevented.\nBack to the Future refashioned the story as dark comedy rather than sentimental allegory.\nMarty's 1985 life at the start of the series is halfway to Pottersville. Lorraine has become an alcoholic; George is a wimp who's still terrorised by Biff.\nIn the second movie, Hill Valley becomes a fully-fledged nightmare, where Biff runs a casino (\"Bikers Welcome\"). Lorraine, with massive breast implants, is now his wife and more of a drunk. Biff, with a wispy yellow comb-over, has an unsettling resemblance to Donald Trump in his bullying TV persona: \"You're fired, butthead.\"\nThe current US presidential election must feel like a nightmare for this generation. Biff Tannen is now running for President!\nOn twitter: @ptby­­rnes", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:29:20.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
