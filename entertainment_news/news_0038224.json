Other women in the top ten include Kate Winslet and singer Ellie Goulding. \nIn the men's category, the survey of 1,000 people placed dedicated vegan Joaquin as the clear winner, seeing off Tobey Maguire in second, third-placed Christian Bale, Woody Harrelson, and Russell Brand. The top ten is rounded out by Ricky Martin, Jared Leto, Chris Martin, Bryan Adams, and Paul McCartney. \nThe Forza Supplements poll found 67 per cent of women and 38 per cent of men had given up eating meat at some stage. \nDiscussing her food preferences in the past, Natalie explained that she gave up eating meat during her childhood and has even tried a vegan diet in the past. \n\"I've been a vegetarian since I was 9 and vegan on and off. A good pasta is probably my favorite dish,\" she said. \nJoaquin, who is a committed campaigner for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), revealed he joined forces with his siblings at the age of 3 to demand a meat-free lifestyle, saying, \"There were five kids and we literally screamed at our parents and said, 'We are never going to eat meat again.'\" \nLee Smith, managing director of Forza Supplements, Britain's most popular diet company, says, \"All the celebrity vegetarians on the list look amazing and show you don't need to eat meat to look great and live healthily.\" Copyright WENN.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:38:54.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
