So we developed a flexible funnel anchored to the shell, to fit over the turtle's tail. But this was not a good answer either. Because the animals are so large, it was difficult to keep the devices in place.\nDr. Kathy Townsend, the station's education coordinator, told coffee about a previous project that involved creating flexible harnesses from \"swimsuit material\" to help study the vision of sea turtle hatchlings.\nCoffee said he modified some second-hand sun shirts to act as harnesses for the \"giant nappy.\"\n\"After a few modifications, including Velcro-attachments for the 'nappy,' we hoped we had the perfect solution to our unusual problem,\" Townsend said. To our great surprise, it worked perfectly. The suits were easy to put on, comfortable for the sea turtles to wear, looked great, and Owen was able to collect the entire fecal sample.\nThe turtles' swimsuits were removed after the samples were collected and the animals returned to the wild in Moreton Bay.\nCopyright 2015 by United Press International Share Comment", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1731809&h=Researcher+puts+sea+turtles+in+swimsuits+to+collect+fecal+samples", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1731809&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1731809"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T12:35:51.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
