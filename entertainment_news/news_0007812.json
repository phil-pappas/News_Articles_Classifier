He had hard-working parents and four sisters and what he did best was bowl. \nThe only thing he did nearly as well was drink, bit in the greater scheme that's not much of a skill. He became an alcoholic, crack addict and fell down that abyss until the kid who once hot combed his hair and wore hundreds of dollars worth of new clothes to the disco, was living in a peep show room on 42nd Street. \nEventually his teeth rotted, he had bugs all over his body and even those who would always take him in, no matter what, were forced to turn him away. He lied and stole, on the prowl for his next fix. \nThis is his story and he tells it in such an unadorned way it is as if he has stripped to his soul and lets you in. And because Bobby is very much every guy from Jersey, it's not hard to immediately feel a kinship. \nBobby worked for his dad's appliance store \"schlepping refrigerators and dishwashers all the f**k over New Jersey. That's the job we were trying to escape from when we'd get decked out to go to the clubs.\" \nHe and his friend ruled the discos and the bowling alleys. Even as a teenager, he pulled in thousands of dollars in a night in something called action bowling. Bob Perry was an alcoholic and drug abuser who truly hit rock bottom then through incredibly hard work redeemed himself. \"Nicky had this totally pimped-out white 1968 Cadillac Eldorado. He would scrub and shine that thing until it looked like a white spaceship, like the g*ddamned thing just touched down from Mars.\" A charmer, Bobby was convinced booze helped him bowl better. He also loved the discos, where plenty of cocaine was everywhere. Combine a kid earning thousands of dollars a night while developing a taste for coke; nothing good can come of this. \nBut he did not see that. No, Bobby only saw the next high. He lied to those he loved and who loved him just to keep the next high coming. \nUltimately it all comes crashing down. And considering the degradation he put himself through, it is shocking how much Bobby remembers in such painstaking detail. \nThere were attempts at rehab, but Bobby would get sober then return to his old ways. When Bobby finally comes clean, he sees an apparition a few times and that sets him on a more spiritual path. He is so completely sincere, that I, at least, have no doubt that Bobby communed with a long dead Franciscan monk wearing a brown robe. \nOf course the reader knows Bobby survives; the title gives that much away. But it's not finding out whether he lives, it's learning how he does. He woke up in crack houses in the Bronx. He checked out an acquaintance's digs – a nook in the subway tunnels where a gigantic sewer rat lived. \nAs Bobby finally gets clean, and it takes him longer and he works harder than many people, I can't help but cheer for him. Once he finally has himself together, a stupid errand for a friend lands him in federal custody. \nWhile rebuilding his life, Bobby plots one last hurrah in Las Vegas at the Super Bowl High Roller Tournament where the top prize is $100,000. \nBobby may not be able to stay until the very final rounds; he's due back before a federal judge. If he skips bail, his beloved and long-suffering sister and her husband will be out their life savings and house. A federal judge grants a continuance and Bobby has petty much everyone rooting for each frame he bowls. \n\"So now, if I did succeed at getting into the finals, I wouldn't have to drop everything right when I got to the top. The fact that a federal judge would allow a continuance on an extortion case because the defendant was bowling in a tournament in Las Vegas – I mean, how amazing is that?\" About as amazing – and improbable – as this book being one you want to press on people, especially those at low points and remind them there is a way back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T14:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:45:00.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
