(We've) done so many recruits, it is sickening,\" Powell laments. Escorting, dancing and sex was Powell's occupation. She ran the business with a troupe of strippers, including her own daughters.\nPowell kept five journals with details of her escort escapades, sexual encounters, murdered relatives and activities at the University of Louisville. Most of the U of L services she provided took place in the men's dormitory where basketball players reside. Her main contact and the man who paid for her services–the school's former director of basketball operations and former graduate assistant, Andre McGee–kept Powell and her girls busy from 2010 to 2014. She has hundreds of text exchanges with him to set up her services as well as pictures of her girls with players and recruits.\nPowell does not present a sympathetic character. Her life is full of contradictions. She has no remorse for her life or the choices she has made. Her story is true, and Breaking Cardinal Rules goes into firsthand and graphic detail. \"This story needs to be told,\" says publisher Patricia Keiffner .\nBreaking Cardinal Rules, Basketball and the Escort Queen will be available @ ibj.com/books\n releases/breaking-cardinal-rules-basketball-and-the-escort-queen---a-new-book-by-katina-powell-with-dick-cady-300153607.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=CL18963&Transmission_Id=201510021707PR_NEWS_USPR_____CL18963&DateId=20151002", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/breaking-cardinal-rules-basketball-and-the-escort-queen---a-new-book-by-katina-powell-with-dick-cady-300153607.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://amazon.com/", "http://ibj.com/books"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T05:26:28.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
