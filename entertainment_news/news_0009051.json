The former was on West Henrietta Road in Brighton and known for its nightly big-band music and dancing. Rund's on the Ridge was in Ridgemont Plaza in Greece, adorned with an enormous aquarium and frequented by Kodak employees.\nWhile the family is still in the hospitality business — with a catering business, a sports bar and more — restaurants bearing the Rund name are long gone.\nAnd while the family oversaw more than a dozen dining establishments over the years, the focus of this column is on Rund's Seafood and Rund's on the Ridge.\n\"Those were the most successful, no question about it,\" said Ted Rund, who owned Rund's on the Ridge and operates the Thirsty Turtle in Victor with his son, Ted Jr.\nSo, whatever happened to Rund's Seafood and Rund's on the Ridge? First, let's look at the family's long history of feeding Rochester-area residents.\nThe legacy began in 1906, when brothers Louis and Bill Rund had a downtown lunch cart. Bill followed with a South Avenue oyster bar/steakhouse in 1936 and Louis opened the Point Pleasant Hotel overlooking Irondequoit Bay.\nBill's sons, Jim and Dick, and daughter Carol opened Rund's Seafood and Steak in 1962. Dick's son \"Duff\" opened what became known as Rund's on the Ridge in 1976 as well as the Periwinkle Pub in Perinton the following year. Ownership of the Greece eatery later was transferred to Duff's brother, Ted.\nRund's on West Henrietta became popular with traveling salesmen who had an \"unofficial fraternity\" that held annual Christmas parties there, said Duff Rund, who lives in Pittsford. The place had a distinctive green awning and a regular house band, as Charlie Wagner wrote in a 1966 Times-Union article.\n\"Rund's is one of the few spots around that swings seven nights a week with 'live' dance music,\" Wagner wrote. \"Joe Cady and his seven-piece group provide the tunes in what Joe calls a 'Glenn Miller style.'\"\nDuff started there as a teenager, sorting silverware before moving up to bus boy. His father was a perfectionist who ran Rund's \"old school,\" Duff said. He remembered the traveling salesmen and the party atmosphere.\n\"It was like a road stop on the Thruway between Buffalo and Albany,\" he said. Salesmen visited for cocktail hour, dinner and \"frisky nights,\" Duff Rund said. \"We had a jacket rule there,\" he added. \"We kept an inventory of coats for people there.\"\nTed Rund said the West Henrietta Rund's had waiting lines for several years and remembered national musical acts that visited and gave the place a Las Vegas feel.\nThe Greece restaurant started as Rund's Hearthside Oyster Bar with a 70-foot oyster bar that news accounts said might have been the longest in the state. The name was later changed to Rund's on the Ridge as the emphasis on oysters was removed.\nThe place kept a nautical feel with a 150-gallon fish tank and seafaring memorabilia as well as three fireplaces. Karen Miltner noted in a 2001 Democrat and Chronicle review, \"A hammerhead shark on the wall near the entrance was caught by general manager Brian Rund, Ted's younger brother, when he was 14.\"\nThe West Henrietta Road Rund's closed around 1993. The building later housed restaurants and bars including MacGregor's and Davinci's before it was torn down in 2008 to make way for a Starbucks.\nRund's on the Ridge lasted longer. Miltner called the place \"a longstanding institution among Rochester restaurants\" that served up to 2,000 patrons a week, and added, \"There's no doubt that Rund's knows how to feed the masses. And the masses gobble it up.\"\nBuy Photo You were unlikely to go home hungry if you chose the buffet at Rund’s on the Ridge, seen in this 2001 file photo. (Photo: Staff file photo 2001)\nA popular all-you-can-eat buffet for five years included crab legs, Duff Rund said. \"It was the place where Kodak executives ate lunch every day,\" he added. Senior citizens also were frequent diners.\nThe place was spared during the great Ice Storm of 1991 that knocked out electrical service to hundreds of thousands of area residents, and patrons \"would come in and wouldn't leave,\" Ted Rund remembered.\nRund's on the Ridge finally closed in 2004 and the family \"brand name\" was retired from restaurants. Ted Rund replaced Rund's on the Ridge with another Thirsty Turtle sports bar, which lasted about a year. The Victor Thirsty Turtle debuted in 2003 and is still going strong.\nThe list of other former Rund family-run restaurants is a long one, including the Roast Beef Tavern on East Main Street, Rund's Seafood Wharf in Gates, the Clipper Restaurant on East Avenue and Rund's Loose Caboose in Webster. Ted and Duff were involved with the start-up of Eagle Vale Golf Club.\nTed still runs Rund's Catering and handles dining for the Harro East Ballroom while Duff said he is \"semi-retired\" but still involved with a catering-management computer software company with his son and son-in-law.\nBut it was the family-named restaurants on West Henrietta Road and in Greece that were the Runds' best-known ventures. The banquet business has proved to be preferable, Ted added.\n\"Restaurants are a lot of work, almost 18 hours a day,\" he said. \"We missed many a Mother's Day, many a Christmas. It got to be too much.\"\nMorrell is a Rochester-based freelance writer.\nAbout this feature\n\"Whatever Happened To ...?\" is a feature that explores favorite haunts of the past and revisits the headlines of yesteryear.
