So what? Movement uncovered Controversial artworks and iconic punk rock images that shocked many viewers have gone on display. Music industry senior lecturer Matt Grimes at the Punk Rock!! So What? exhibition Tweet \nThe pictures capture the punk rock movement from its spit-flecked inception in the 1970s to its influence on modern culture. \nThe exhibition, called Punk Rock!! So What?, is being held at Birmingham City University’s Parkside Gallery and features posters, singles and album covers from both the movement’s big-hitters and lesser-known bands. \nAll of the images are provocative and intended to shock – much like the genre itself. \nAmong the exhibits are posters of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher defecating into a bucket and an image of a Roman Catholic cardinal at a 1930s Nazi parade. \nAlthough many of the pieces are from the late 1970s and early 1980s, there are also items from the present day highlighting punk’s continuing influence. \nThe exhibition will run until November 13 and shows the changing imagery of punk – alongside its influence on societal, cultural and political thinking. \nAmong the images is a painting of the Statue of Liberty hiding its face in shame. \nBut one of the biggest highlights is the exhibition’s collection of colourful singles and album covers from the period. \nAlways more a singles-oriented movement than an albums one, many of the images have become iconic. \nAmong those on display are covers of early singles by the Sex Pistols and The Clash, including Complete Control, Clash City Rockers and Tommy Gun. \nThe Damned’s Neat Neat Neat is also among the collection along with artwork from early singles by The Jam, such as the band’s debut In the City and later follow-up The Modern World. It also delves a little later in the period with the artwork for Siouxsie and the Banshees’ Hong Kong Garden from 1978. \nLesser-known but still important groups such as Mancunian band Slaughter and the Dogs and Crass are also represented. \nAlbum covers also form part of the exhibition – including the iconic black and white cover shot from US band the Ramones’ self-titled debut. This Riot Squad single featured an image of Margaret Thatcher Sick Boy single cover by Birmingham band Charged GBH Killing Joke’s album shows a cardinal at a Nazi parade Crass’ 1978 debut album The Feeding Of The 5,000 ‘Oh, America’ by Gee Vaucher, who did artwork for Crass Record covers by bands involved in the first wave of UK Punk Artwork for Siouxsie and the Banshees, 1978 \nAlthough 60s and early 70s bands such as The Velvet Underground, The Stooges and The New York Dolls were a major influence, the Ramones were arguably the first true punk band. The cover of their first LP has the band clad in ripped and faded jeans and leather jackets, glaring at the camera with blank faces. \nThe music on the album, short sharp songs barely clocking up three minutes, proved a revelation to musicians tired of the prevailing hard rock and prog rock styles. It was a major influence on members of The Clash. \nAll of the pieces have been collected by designer and punk historian Dr Russell Bestley who curated the exhibition to coincide with ‘Punk Now!!’ – an international conference organised by the UK’s Punk Scholars Network. The event will be held at Birmingham City University’s Parkside Building from October 29 to 30. \nMatt Grimes, senior lecturer in music industries at Birmingham City University’s Faculty of Art, Design and Media, said the aim of the exhibition was to show how punk had evolved over the years. \n“The exhibition features punk art in a number of its manifestations over a number of years, and demonstrates its aesthetic development and diversity,” he said. \n“Hopefully this exhibition will not only inspire younger generations of artists and musicians but also re-engage older audiences with a specific, perhaps even significant, part of their past lives.” Receive daily email updates from the Express & Star \nWe'll send a morning digest of the day's biggest news and sport stories straight to your inbox.
