Hobson has been an illusionist for years, spending 15 of them performing his own show on the Las Vegas strip. One day he got a call from a producer who had the idea to bring together a group of illusionists to put on a huge stage show. At first, he didn’t think much of it, suspecting it was probably going to be a small show. But eventually he agreed to it. “Next thing we know, our very first show was at the Sydney Opera House,” he said. The show is called “ The Illusionists ,” where a group of the top magicians in the world performing their A material. The show has played on Broadway for the past year, and the group is taking it on tour. The first stop: Sangamon Auditorium. Seven of the best Each of the seven magicians have a persona. There’s Andrew Basso, “The Escapologist”; Dan Sperry, “The Anti-Conjurer”; Kevin James, “The Inventor”; Yu Ho-Jin, “The Manipulator”; Ben Blaque, “The Weapon Master”; and Jonathan Goodwin, “The Daredevil.” Hobson is known as “The Trickster.” “Don’t turn your back on me,” he said. “I might steal something from you.” Hobson characterizes himself as the comedy magician. While his cohorts are performing breathtaking stunts, he’s the one who brings a light-hearted feel to the show. “I’m the one who doesn’t take himself too seriously,” he said. He doesn’t want to give away too much about the show because much of it is supposed to remain a surprise for the audience, but one of his favorite parts is one of the most endearing moments of the show. “My favorite part of the show is a part where a little girl in the audience gets a magical rose,” he said. “It’s an endearing moment in the show. It’s a beautiful magic rose trick.” A big hit While Broadway is generally a place reserved for some of the best theater and musical theater in the world, the venue has also been home to “The Illusionists” for the past year. In fact, it was so widely acclaimed, it was the fourth-best selling show at a time, among acclaimed shows like “Phantom of the Opera” and “The Lion King.” Page 2 of 2 - “We were sold out and we added shows,” Hobson said. When Sangamon Auditorium first announced its 2015-16 season, Director Bob Vaughn predicted that “The Illusionists” would be one of the more anticipated shows of the season because magic shows appeal to a wide group of people. Hobson agrees. “It embodies everything a town like (Springfield) would like,” he said. “This show appeals to the children in us.” 'The best magic show in the world' For people who expect just another run-of-the-mill, cheesy magic show, Hobson promises the experience will be nothing like that. For one thing, the show is littered with amazing feats and magicians who each specialize in a different aspect of the art. For another thing, most other magic shows bore Hobson because he knows how all of it is done. He doesn’t even bother going to see some of the most lauded show sin Vegas because of that. But “The Illusionists” is far from boring for him. “It is the best magic show in the world,” Hobson said. “I watch the show every night. There’s not much better of an endorsement than that.” — Contact Carla Jimenez: 788-1542; carla.jimenez @sj-r.com; twitter.com/CarlaJimenezSJR . *** * When: 8:30 p.m., Oct. 13 * Where: Sangamon Auditorium, University of Illinois Springfield * Tickets: $62-72 price range; available at sangamonauditorium.org or 206-6160 By Carla Jimenez , Staff writer The State Journal-Register By Carla Jimenez , Staff writer Posted Oct. 7, 2015 at 10:00 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:30:47.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
