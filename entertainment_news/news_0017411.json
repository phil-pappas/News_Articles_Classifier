Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday that he hasn't been subpoenaed as part of a federal probe into the contracting for the Buffalo Billion initiative, but declined to offer details about whether he or others have been questioned. U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, who has vowed to investigate corruption in state government, last summer opened a probe into whether contracts for the massive development using public incentives were improperly granted.\nBut Cuomo denied today that he has been subpoenaed, but didn't say specifically if others have or if he has been questioned as part of the federal review.\n\"I have not, but I don’t want to get into commenting on a U.S. Attorney’s investigation,\" Cuomo told reporters in Albany today.\n(If you're on a mobile device, you can watch the video here: http://bcove.me/agoa0kcc )\nBharara's inquiry became public last month after the media, including Gannett's Albany Bureau , confirmed that his office had sent subpoenas to the SUNY Polytechnic Institute, which is the main public-sector driver of the projects in Buffalo, including the expansive Solar City manufacturing facility.\nThe Albany-based college denied any wrongdoing and said it’s not at the center of any probe, which is believed to be focused on whether Cuomo's campaign donors received preferential treatment in the contract bidding.\nCuomo, too, urged against rushing to judgment on Bharara's action.\nBharara this year has indicted the two former legislative leaders on corruption charges in separate cases, and they -- former Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos -- are set for trial next month.\n\"You have to keep it in focus,\" Cuomo warned Wednesday. \"I was attorney general. I did hundreds of 'Quote: -unQuote: ' investigations, where I sent out a subpoena because I read something, or heard something, and you wanted to follow up. That does not mean that anything was awry.\"\nHe said it would be too soon to take steps to fix any procurement problems in state government.\n\"Do you know if there was any problem? No,\" Cuomo continued. \"If you knew there was a problem, you would fix the problem. But we don’t know any problem.\"", "external_links": ["http://bcove.me/agoa0kcc"], "published": "2015-10-07T21:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T20:05:38.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
