The series ended in 2007, but its cult-like following has endured. So too, have rumors of a revival - Variety notes that the subject came up over the summer when Sherman-Palladino reunited with many of the show’s stars at the ATX Television Festival.\nAccording to TV Line, Netflix is planning a series of four 90-minute episodes, to be written by Sherman-Palladino and Palladino, who famously left “Gilmore Girls” before its seventh season, following lengthy (and reportedly heated) negotiations with Warner Bros. studios.\nSo far, Netflix has remained mum. And it’s unclear whether the show’s biggest stars, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel - who starred as mother-daughter duo Lorelai and Rory Gilmore - would be involved. That hasn’t stopped fans on Twitter from speculating about possible storylines.\nIf a “Gilmore Girls” reboot makes it to Netflix, the show will be in nostalgia-filled company: The streaming company has already announced plans to give new life to fan favorites “Degrassi” and “Full House.”", "external_links": ["http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/gilmore-girls-netflix-limited-series-1201621369/", "http://tvline.com/2015/10/19/gilmore-girls-revival-netflix-new-episodes/"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T12:30:49.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
