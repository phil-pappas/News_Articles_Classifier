No.\"\nMore than 30,000 people shared the mom's message and hundreds showed their support.\n\"I recall being told the same thing as a kid,\" another woman commented on Facebook. \"Power parenting medal to you...for setting the example of how we should treat people.\"\nOn Monday, the Nationwide Children's Hospital told CBS News that they are aware of the comment that was made by a staff member.\n\"Although we know the comment was made with no malicious intent, it is our wish to apologize and express to you that this is something we are taking seriously,\" the hospital said in a statement. \"This comment does not represent our philosophy as an institution.\"\nThe hospital contacted the Smith family the same day the Facebook post was written.\n\"We have reached out to the family, met with the employee and their management team, as well as our leadership in order to understand the situation and take measures to prevent this from happening again,\" the hospital said.\nSmith appreciated the gesture and said it was never her intention to \"attack the hospital\" or get the man who \"genuinely meant no harm\" to get fired.\n\"This is about all adults being part of the village and creating a culture where people know what healthy relationships look like and sound like, what it feels like to be in a healthy relationship,\" she said.\n\"The fact is that stereotype about the boy who likes the girl pulling her pigtails has got to go,\" one Facebook user commented.\nSmith agreed, \"Pulling hair is not affection either.\"\nDraw a picture, write a letter, a poem -- but do not confuse aggression with affection, she warned.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154350797679498&set=a.10150429054219498.434118.751704497&type=3&theater", "https://www.facebook.com/NationwideChildrensHospital?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-12T20:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:15:40.494+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
