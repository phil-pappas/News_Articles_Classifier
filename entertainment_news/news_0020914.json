Approval would require a general plan amendment and zone change.\nThe commissioners also observed there are three apartment complexes in the area, which encompasses Inland Valley Medical Center and Oak Creek shopping center.\nUltimate approval rests with the City Council, which would consider the commission’s recommendations in a future hearing.\nContact the writer: 951-368-9690 or michaelwilliams@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwjiwd-b88545675z.120151020153613000g1scmpmc.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwjiwd-b88545675z.120151020153613000g1scmpmc.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T12:06:11.759+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
