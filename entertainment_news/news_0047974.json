They likely will need a new water heater around the same time. Boxes from their springtime move sit in the living room, waiting to be unpacked. Paintings still need to go up on the walls.\nBut when Ben looks around their new Greece home, he doesn't see chores. He sees possibilities.\n\"There is so much potential in what we've just done in buying a house,\" he said, sitting in his sunroom with Wolf and their infant daughter, Amber. \"There's the potential for a happy home, raising a family and watching my daughter grow up in these rooms.\"\nPeople in middle- and upper-income brackets may see homeownership as a given. Many people like the Kershners — at or just above the poverty line — still want that legacy for their children.\nBut their path to that piece of the American dream can be complicated.\nAdvocates say that disparities in mortgage lending have made it more difficult for some minority groups in the Rochester area to own homes, and foreclosures have hit low-income, African-American and Latino neighborhoods hardest.\nThe problem isn't just in the city.\nFrom 2000 to 2011, the number of poor people grew in Rochester's suburbs by about 73 percent — a growth rate far higher than in the city itself, according to data compiled by the Brookings Institution. Scarcity of moderately priced houses in the inner-ring suburbs also limit options for those low-income wage earners.\nPrograms help people overcome these obstacles, but advocates say more can be done.\nWith a major initiative under way to alleviate local poverty, proponents say that owning a home can be a powerful way for poor people to build wealth and stability as long as the lending terms are fair, and buyers are well-educated about the financial responsibilities that go with the purchase.\nFor families across the economic spectrum, homeownership often seems like a natural step. Chad Rieflin, director of program and grants for Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Rochester, said parents decide they need a different environment for their children or see others moving up the ladder.\n\"They come upon this mindset as seeing ownership as the point to get to,\" he said.\nFor Ben Kershner, it's also about having something of tangible worth to pass on to Amber and her big brother, 10-year-old Nathaniel.\n\"There's the potential for a lot of money,\" Kershner said.\nBuy Photo Wolf Kershner pours tortilla chips into a bowl to serve with chili for dinner for her family at their home in Greece.

(Photo: LAUREN PETRACCA/@laurenpetracca/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER)\nA complicated path\nAt the end of 2013, about two-thirds of Americans, regardless of income level, owned their homes, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The figures in Monroe County are similar, but of all the households in the county that own homes, only about one in 10 earns less than $35,000 a year. That's lower than the national average — about one in five U.S. families who own homes fall in that income bracket.\nResearch has found that homeownership is a goal of many people who are classified as poor. A study from Purdue University found the majority of urban poor respondents believed they would own a home in the future, and nearly one-fifth already owned or were in the process of buying a home.\nBut the national foreclosure crisis hurt some of these owners the most.\nA report this year by the Empire Justice Center found that people who own homes in low-income or predominantly minority neighborhoods have been more likely to see their property values decline.\nA separate study by Empire Justice Center showed disparities in mortgage lending that also might make it more difficult for some minority groups to own homes. Mortgage lending in the city decreased from 2010 to 2013, the report said. During that same time, lending to African-Americans declined while lending to Hispanics and Asians remained relatively constant.\nWhile recent changes to census tract data made it hard to compare neighborhoods over several years, between 2012 and 2013, the only neighborhoods showing a decline in lending were those where 80 percent to 100 percent of the residents were nonwhite.\nAll this might raise questions about just how accessible homeownership is to families who live paycheck to paycheck. But housing experts say it makes financial sense to buy — especially in Rochester, where they say there is a lack of affordable public housing, and where rent paid to private landlords can be hundreds of dollars more than a mortgage payment.\n\"Someone making $30,000 in a city like Rochester is much better off cleaning up their credit, getting down-payment assistance and becoming a homeowner,\" said Ruhi Maker, a senior attorney with Empire Justice who studies housing and housing policy. Her only caveats are that the house should be in good condition, and the person should be planning to stay for several years.\nHelping renters become owners\nBerta Rivera, coordinator of the Creating Assets, Savings & Hope (CASH) Coach Program at the Empire Justice Center, didn't have data to back up the effect of homeownership on low-income workers. But she recalled a single mother who was able to buy a house and provide a backyard for her child to play in.\n\"Whether or not there are statistics behind whether it improves poverty, people who are lower-income still have that interest in, 'This is something I want. Regardless of what anybody thinks, I want this for myself and my family.'\"\nShe said that assets — such as a house — are the biggest way for families to gain and keep wealth. \"They have something to hand over to the next generation that pushes that generation after you one step ahead. Now they have a home. It helps to break the cycle of poverty because now we have something we can hold onto.\"\nThere's good evidence, for example, that when a family that goes through the stress of moving from one apartment to the next ultimately ends up in a home of their own, their children go on to graduate at a far higher rate, said Matthew Flanigan, CEO of Flower City Habitat for Humanity.\n\"How you break the cycle of poverty, one family at a time, is when the kids succeed in school,\" he said.\nBuy Photo Wolf and Ben Kershner prepare chili for dinner in their kitchen in Greece. “There is so much potential in what we’ve just done in buying a house,” Ben Kershner said.

It was small, and it was expensive.\n\"We knew we wanted a house,\" Wolf Kershner, 38, said. \"We knew we didn't have a lot of funds.\"\nWhile Wolf Kershner was pregnant with Amber, she qualified for Medicaid. She receives WIC benefits for her daughter, but the family makes too much to qualify for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps). They do qualify for heating assistance.\nSo why buy a house and take on all that financial responsibility?\n\"Even with the maintenance cost and all the taxes and the insurance costs and all the little ancillary expenses, the idea was it still would be cheaper,\" he said. \"Even if it came out breaking even, it still would be cheaper to own a house. Worst case, if it cost the same, we'd be better off.\"\nHusband and wife talked about the physical and emotional stability of their own house.\n\"I think what's all too common with low-income people is moving a lot, not because you want to, but because, hey, there is a place across town that is $100/month cheaper,\" Ben Kershner said. \"If you're a renter and low-income, $100/month is huge.\"\nBuy Photo Wolf Kershner laughs with her 6-month-old baby, Amber, as her son Nathaniel runs around the Greece home they bought this year, assisted by home-buying programs. “We knew we wanted a house,” Wolf Kershner, 38, said. “We knew we didn’t have a lot of funds.” (Photo: LAUREN PETRACCA/@laurenpetracca/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER)\n\"The psychological benefit that comes from the extra space, the psychological benefit that comes from knowing this is our place, those are additional values,\" Wolf Kershner said.\nRenting provides an address, but not a sense of place, Wolf Kershner said.\nA couple of weeks after moving in, she was in the backyard, looking over the fence at neighbor's houses and realizing no one was going anywhere.\n\"Even if you are not planning on moving, if you are surrounded by other renters, there is an emotional assumption that they are planning on moving,\" she said. \"It was eye-opening to realize that these people, living next door to us, were going to be the same people living next door to us in 10 years. That it was not just our home that was more stable because of this move, but our neighborhood.\"\nBen Kershner grew up in a house owned by his parents. Wolf lived in a series of rental homes when she was young.\n\"I grew up feeling like I would have been normal if I had a house that my parents owned,\" she said. \"Not that anyone I knew had a house their parents owned. But that's what normal is supposed to be. That's what you're supposed to shoot for.\"\nFinding the right help\nLinda Wilson, a Realtor for nearly three decades, said about 30 percent of her clientele are low-income buyers. She said many people who want to own and could afford a home disqualify themselves because they don't know about grants or other assistance.\nWilson, who said she handles the sales of many rentals, asks tenants why they aren't buying the house.\n\"I have some properties that are listed, the tenants are paying $800, $1,000, $1,200 a month,\" said the associate broker with Nothnagle Realtors. \"If you can afford that, you can afford to buy your own house. If they haven't thought of the idea, I at least put it in their heads.\"\nShalonda Bradley made the jump from renting to owning her home in September, when she closed on a house on Normandy Avenue in the city's 19th Ward. Bradley grew up in the neighborhood, but lived in Chili for many years. She decided to move back in part because her teenage daughter wanted to attend Rochester's School of the Arts, and she wanted a place of her own.\nBradley found her two-story yellow house through HOME Rochester. The program, which has fixed up and sold more than 660 vacant houses in the city to low- and moderate-income buyers, receives both public and private funding and is run by the Greater Rochester Housing Partnership.\nAs part of the deal, Bradley had to go through financial counseling and agree to stay in the home for 15 years. She hopes to be an example to her 15-year-old daughter, now a sophomore majoring in dance.\n\"I want her to follow that type of footstep and one day hopefully purchase her own home,\" Bradley said.\nIt's also about building equity, said Bradley, a licensed practical nurse.\n\"It's wanting to see your money going toward something that's going to be yours.\"\nAnd, she pointed out, \"If I want to paint the walls green, I can. It's mine.\"\nBradley also went through a first-time home club available at a number of local banks. These collaborations among nonprofits, local government and lending institutions provide education and reward financial discipline with grants.\nTypically, participants have to take a homebuyer education course while setting aside savings for at least 10 months. Bradley, for example, saved the maximum of $1,875. The bank then matches the buyer's contributions four to one, creating a sum that can be put toward a down payment or closing costs.\n\"It's a critical program to promote homeownership across every segment of the population, regardless of income,\" said Philip Swetz, affordable housing solutions manager for First Niagara Bank, where Bradley went through the program.\nOpening opportunities\nThe city also has helped first-time homebuyers for several years through its Employer Assisted Housing Initiative, a collaboration between the city and several of the area's largest businesses, including the University of Rochester, Xerox and the Rochester School District. Most recently, since July 2012, various programs have led to approximately 660 grants to families to buy homes in Rochester.\nMonroe County partners with The Housing Council at PathStone and uses money from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to help eligible first-timers who want to buy outside the city. Over the past couple of years, changes in the program have reduced the numbers who received help — from 34 in 2013, to 17 in 2014, to nine so far this year.\nWhile Empire Justice argues that banks can do much more to help low-income buyers, financial institutions contend they are doing their best within the confines of more strict financial regulations that followed the housing crash.\n\"I think every institution in our community is making a concerted effort to try to focus their energies on trying to increase homeownership in the city,\" said Brad Pasley, senior vice president and Community Reinvestment Act officer for Canandaigua National Bank.\nPasley said the bank is exploring other ways to gauge a borrower's ability to pay if they have minimal or poor credit, such as a history of paying rent on time.\nThe Kershners declared bankruptcy seven years ago, but said their credit now is good. They still are paying their student loans. They said that while living in Irondequoit, they occasionally used the town's food pantry.\nThey started in the first-time home club through the Housing Council at PathStone in 2014. The Kershners deposited about $200 a month for 10 months into an account dedicated for their house.\n\"When you're paying too much for rent in the first place, it's a difficult thing to do,\" Ben Kershner said.\n\"Many times the normal bank account had $10 or less in it, but we managed to consistently keep the regular payment for the one for the grant,\" Wolf Kershner said.\nBuy Photo The Kershners were able to buy their home in Greece after qualifying for a program that helps low-income first-time homebuyers. (Photo: LAUREN PETRACCA/@laurenpetracca/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER)\nIf they had missed a payment, they would have had to start the program all over again, but they wouldn't have lost any money.\nThey started looking for a house this past January and thought they would settle on the east side. But a month later, they saw what they wanted — a ranch with an attic and full basement, off Stone Road. Their savings and grant money covered the down payment and closing costs, and they have an $80,000 mortgage.\nIn the few months they've lived in the house, they've hit the highs and lows. They combined Nathaniel's 10th birthday party with a housewarming, and Ben Kershner was stymied by a balky faucet but fixed a small hole in the roof.\n\"That is my ugly black tar patch in the roof,\" he said, beaming. \"I climbed up on the ladder. I made it. I'm proud of it.\"\nPSINGER@Gannett.com\nDRILEY@Gannett.com\nAbout this project\nThis is the second in an occasional series examining poverty in the Rochester region and what's being done to find solutions.
