Oktoberfest is actually a style called M채rzen, but when it's brewed for the 16-day festival held in Munich, it takes on its new name. Of course, by now, any M채rzen brewed for the fall, whether it's actually brewed for the festival or not, gets labeled as an Oktoberfest beer. M채rzen's are lagers known for their malty flavors and the clean, crisp finish. Similar to the M채rzen is its cousin, the amber ale. Similar in body, amber ales are all about the caramel malts, though a decent hop profile keeps it in balance. It's also not uncommon to see amber ales passed off as Oktoberfests, despite the big difference the two have: one's an ale, the other's a lager. Popular for balanced flavor, amber ales are brewed by brewers across the country. In New Jersey, Flying Fish does its excellent Red Fish, River Horse does its own version in its Special Ale, and Rinn Duin does a good Irish Red. Nationally, there are also plenty to choose from: Troegs' Nuggest Nectar, Stone's Levetation, Bell's Amber, Anderson Valley's Boont, and New Belgium's Fat Tire. And, of course, there's Ballast Point's Calico. Calico pours a deep ruby red with a thick, dense tan head. The lace sticks along the glass as the head stays thick throughout. The nose begins with the malts. Toasted caramel and burnt biscuit, which then mix with peppery and piney hops that give balance. The taste follows similarly: malts first, hops second. Lightly roasted caramel and biscuit lead the way, followed by some fruity hops that give notes of orange and grapefruit. Some bitterness comes through towards the end, as the malt lends to a dry finish. Little of the 5.50% ABV is noticeable, though a decent hop bite (35 IBUs) is noticeable, as is the trend with American ambers.
