Ernest Players, singers and listeners have a good time at the Oct. 6 Benefit Music Jam in Thomaston; the weekly series is ongoing on Tuesdays evenings. \nThomaston — The popular Tuesday night benefit music jams continue weekly in the walk-in lower level of the Thomaston Federated Church on Hyler Street; parking and entrance, handicapped accessible, are off Dunn Street. \nDoors open 6:30 p.m. for the 7 to 9 p.m. jams, which offer an opportunity for local players to sit in a circle and play together, usually country and folk music. Participants work together to play pieces they all know or can pick up. It is usually mostly instrumental, but singers are welcome to contribute to what’s being played. \nThere is no charge for either musicians or those who come to enjoy their jamming, but donations are welcome and go to the church and to the Maine Fiddle Camp Scholarship Fund. \nListeners are encouraged to take a seat and relax or get up and dance if they like. The evenings are casual and fun. For more information, call Wayne Keiderling at 504-2745. (Photo by: Dagney C.
