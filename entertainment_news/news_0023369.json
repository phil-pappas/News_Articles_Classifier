Paranormal Acitivity 5 – is being announced as the end of the horror franchise. Hence the tagline, “You will finally see the activity.”\nBut director Gregory Plotkin sees it as the end of other things as well. Found-footage horror, for one.\n“Found footage is waning,” he concedes, adding with a chuckle. “If somebody found a box of old (possessed) VHS tapes, who would even have the machine to play them anymore?”\nHe also sees it as the end of a non-violent, suspense-heavy era of horror, one that pretty much derailed the entire torture-porn genre of Saw, Hostel et al.\nWhen creator Oren Peli came out with Paranormal Activity in 2009 – about a young couple that videotapes their bedroom to capture strange, demonic events – it was a $15,000 film that took in $200 million. Once studios realized they could get that kind of return on a movie where the scares came from doors opening and closing, elaborate killing mechanisms went out the window.\nAn entire studio – Jason Blum’s Blumhouse Productions – sprung up around the franchise and the newly-revived genre. Other films and franchises, including Sinister and the recent The Gallows, even borrowed the found-footage plotline holus bolus.\nAnd now? Plotkin, who’s edited all but the original film, and is making his directorial debut with the franchise finale, thinks violence is about to make a comeback.\n“There’s really not been any blood in the franchise and we take a lot of pride in that. But I get a sense that there’s more violent horror around the corner. I don’t know if it’s going to be as extreme as the Saws and Hostels and so forth. But I get a sense that there’s a swing in that direction coming.\n“But there could be other things happening. It Follows, for example (last year’s Cannes-sensation about a supernatural curse that moves from person to person through sexual encounters). Obviously that wasn’t a blood-slash-and-gore film. It felt more like an ‘80s horror film, and I liked it a lot.\n“Change is great. Horror is like any format, you want to change it up.”\nBut as for found footage, the saying, ‘You dance with who brung ya,’ applies to the Paranormal Activity franchise.\nIn Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension, a game developer named Ryan (Chris J. Murray) and his brother Mike (Dan Gill) find, yes, a box of old videotapes and an ancient video camera that can apparently see “the other side.” The tapes include scenes of the young and ill-fated children Katie and Kristi being tutored on the supernatural by their witch grandmother Lois (Hallie Foote). At one point, the characters onscreen break the “fourth wall” and then other stuff happens.\nMuch of that stuff centres around Ryan’s daughter Leila (Ivy George).\nSo, found footage again? “We’ve had the same team since Paranormal Activity 2,” Plotkin says. “Our conversation’s always been, ‘That is the esthetic that worked.’ We looked back at the sequel to The Blair Witch Project, and it didn’t stay true to the first movie. And it obviously didn’t work.”\nSo as the 20th century evolves, and videotape becomes more quaint, he says more effort has been put into making the footage look, well, crappy. “I’ve been on these films where we have cameras they buy at Best Buy. And when you’re running around with them, you’re going to get shaky footage, no matter how good the stabilizer is.\n“And if there are flashbacks we try to create imperfections in those videos that would keep the reality there.”\nBut the best part of the project, Plotkin says, was spilling the beans. Actress Katie Featherston is back as the adult Katie, who gives the best evil, possessed grin in the business.\n“I encourage everyone to see the movie to see how it unfolds. It’s a franchise that’s built on what you don’t see. And now we’re going to answer some questions. ‘Who is Toby’? (The heretofore invisible demon, who has manifested as a shape in dust or as footprints left on flour). How does he fit in the mythology? What is the end game for the coven, etc.?\n“It’s been an honour and a blast to work on the franchise. And yeah, it was great that they came to me and said, ‘We want you to direct this one, and we want to go out strong.’”\nTwitter: @jimslotek\njim.slotek@sunmedia.ca\nSponsored Links See All Sponsored Links\n'Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension' director promises franchise will go out with a bang Gregory Plotkin says series will also mark the end of found-footage horror\nBy Jim Slotek , Postmedia Network First posted: Sunday, October 18, 2015 08:00 AM EDT | Updated: Friday, October 16, 2015 01:52 PM EDT\nParanormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension – a.k.a.
