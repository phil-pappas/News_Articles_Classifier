The attack shocked the international ballet world and exposed infighting within the theater. \nIn presenting Vaziev on Monday, Bolshoi general director Vladimir Urin said he would take up his new post on March 18 when Filin's contract ends. \nFrom 1995 to 2008, Vaziev was director of the Kirov Ballet of the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg, where previously he had been a principal dancer. He has been at La Scala since early 2009. Â© 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc.
