She was talking about her \"dream come true\" SNL debut when an audience member started yelling at her. \nSchumer warned the lady to stop heckling and when she continued to speak out, the Trainwreck star asked security to escort the woman and her friend out of the venue. \nFans applauded as the unruly audience member and her guest left the gig. \nThe rest of Schumer's stand-up show went without a hitch.
