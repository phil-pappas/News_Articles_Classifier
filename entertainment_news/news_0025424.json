Liza is Enrique’s sweetheart.\nEnrique had one drink too many before he boarded the plane and continued drinking while on flight. He annoyed — to put it very mildly — Luis, Jessy, and even Liza, causing a commotion.\nPaulo and Jake, Enrique’s drinking buddies, were tightlipped on the incident.\n•\nDISPLINARY ACTION – Jessy’s mother is thinking of legal action against Enrique, but perhaps a court case may not be needed if ABS-CBN management takes disciplinary action against its artist.\nSure, Enrique has publicly apologized, but that may not be enough. A suspension is in order.\n•\nPROFESSIONAL BUT – Back to Ms. Santos’ words, about actors loving their work and audience.\nIn fairness, Enrique loves his work, his craft. He has improved considerably as an actor. Also, Enrique is professional on the set, hardworking and dedicated.\nBut it seems he doesn’t love his audience, judging from his bad behavior. And the PAL incident isn’t the first time.\nTwice before Enrique got into trouble because of too much alcohol.\nA bad example for his many followers, young and old alike.\n•\nLECTURE ON – So please, Ma’am Charo, initiate a lecture (extensive one) on decorum, courtesy, etiquette. Make attendance a must, including even well-behaved stars like Piolo Pascual and Julia Montes.\nOr Coco Martin and Matteo Guidicelli, although years back they had a fight which was immediately settled.\nBy all means, the following stars should be asked, required, to attend the lecture.\nAs they come to mind: John Lloyd Cruz, Baron Geisler, Ellen Adarna, Kim Chiu, Xian Lim, Claudine Baretto, JM de Guzman, Anne Curtis, Paulo Avelino, Jake Cuenca, Angelika Panganiban, Maja Salvador, Billy Crawford, Colleen Garcia. And of course ENRIQUE GIL.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:16:59.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
