Started in 2001, Kidz Bop is a group of young singers and dancers who perform family-friendly versions of pop hits from stars including Taylor Swift, Pharrell Williams and Iggy Azalea. They have gone through various groups of young performers, with Martinez part of the most recent cast along with Ashlynn Chong, Bredia Santoro and Grant Knoche. \nWhen he got the job, Martinez, his mom and younger brother moved to Los Angeles. This was his first big professional gig, although he had been in an Eggo waffle commercial. \nThe 12-year-old seventh-grader studies through an online school and loves his recording and performing life. His favorite song to perform is OMI's \"Cheerleader\" and the Kidz Bop original \"Make Some Noise,\" which is on the latest album, \"Kidz Bop 30.\" \n\"I get to go places I could never have imagined,\" said Martinez, who remembers repeatedly listening to \"Kidz Bop 24\" when he was younger. \"We went to Alaska. And Nashville, once you're there, the whole place is music.\" \nHe is really looking forward to the concerts in Manhattan and Red Bank. \n\"I'm super-excited,\" he said, adding he's hoping to see a lot of old friends at the shows. \nEmail: yoriok@northjersey.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:57:40.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
