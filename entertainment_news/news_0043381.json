Stephanie Marcus Entertainment Editor, Huffington Post Posted: 10/08/2015 03:04 PM EDT \nIs there room in Westeros for two Red Priestesses? \nSpoiler alert for \"Game of Thrones\" Season 6. \nDeadline was the first to report that British actress Melanie Liburd has been cast as another Red Priestess on \"Game of Thrones,\" but no word as to whether her character will replace Melisandre (Carice van Houten), who is a incarnation of the Red Priestess or Red Woman. A photo posted by Melanie Liburd (@mellyliburd) on Sep 27, 2015 at 5:38pm PDT \nWhile many are already speculating as to how Liburd's casting could affect Jon Snow's storyline, the actress noted that she's filming in Spain , which is where the series shoots scenes that take place Meereen or Dorne . Both are places we don't expect to see Snow -- dead or alive -- this season. \nAdditionally, set photos and an audition tape for the part that leaked earlier this year seem to confirm that her character will be arriving in Meereen at some point this season. Meanwhile, a recent sighting of Kit Harington on set in Belfast, Ireland seems to imply Snow will continue to have his hands full in the North.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:46:30.279+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
