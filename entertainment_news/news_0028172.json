The story, though, is tinier than Muzak. So skip the flick and buy the soundtrack, which features gems like Cat Stevens’“Pop Star,” Harry Nilsson’s “Jump into the Fire” and Bob Dylan’s “Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door.” Even Zooey Deschanel, a musician in the duo She & Him, joins the fun with a gnarly rendition of Meredith Brooks’“B-tch.” But if you must – and the lure of a movie starring Bill Murray, Bruce Willis and Kate Hudson is certainly enticing – know that this is significantly less than you’d expect from Oscar-winning director Barry Levinson (“Rainman”). It’s cinematic catnip. And like that herb, the buzz wears off quickly. With Murray comfortably in his wheelhouse playing down-on-his-luck music manager Richie Lanz, this should have been a slam dunk. Richie, who claims he discovered Madonna, is a rascal with an ear for talent and knack for brokering, even with Taliban warlords. But he struggles to negotiate a ridiculous script by “The Recruit” scribe Mitch Glazer mired in terrible dialogue and subplots that go nowhere, including one with Danny McBride and Scott Caan as the “Ammo Kings of Kabul.” Another bit has Richie sizably in debt to Willis’ mercenary. Levinson and Glazer call on every culture-clash cliche in the book. Characters come and go, and are never heard from again. Poor Kate Hudson, with bedazzled eyebrows, plays a hooker named Merci, and “mercy” is what you’ll want to scream as Levinson rolls along, squandering the talents of good actors and a decent premise. After a plan goes awry to make Deschanel’s Ronnie a star on a USO trip, Richie discovers an Afghan woman (Leem Lubany) with an extraordinary voice. With the help of Richie – and Allah – she lands on “Afghan Star,” that country’s version of “American Idol.” Big problems arise as Salima’s appearance brings scorn and disgrace upon herself and her Pashtun village. She sings a Western song – in English – and she’s a woman. That triple-whammy earns her infidel status. But that doesn’t deter Richie. “Salima is my act and I am her manager and she needs me.” Yeah, but no one needs this movie. For a better take on the premise, check out the 2009 documentary “Afghan Star.” Tapping all the curmudgeon and fish-out-of-water delight he has so effortlessly displayed in other off-beat comedies, Murray can’t do a lick to save “Rock the Kasbah.” His character, like the others here, is woefully under drawn. Levinson and Glazer have zero interest in Salima, their title character. She’s seen in the opening and then not again until well into the second act. Her function is to serve Richie’s climb from rock-bottom to relevance. However, this never feels like anything more than a stock Murray character. Only this time, he just happens to be stuck in the Middle East. Movie review ROCK THE KASBAH (R for language including sexual references, some drug use and brief violence.) Cast Bill Murray, Kate Hudson, Bruce Willis, Zooey Deschanel.
