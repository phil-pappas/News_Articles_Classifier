A mix of self-help and memoir, \"Strong is the New Sexy: My Kickass Story on Getting My 'Formula for Fierce,'\" generated an initial flurry of press for a section titled \"The Governor of New Jersey Tried to Eat Me,\" in which the erstwhile \"Jersey Shore\" star criticizes Gov. Chris Christie. \nBut otherwise the book has been met with cultural crickets. \nOnly two customer reviews so far on Amazon, and a sales number that doesn't quite suggest it will be competing anytime soon with \"Go Set a Watchman\" or \"Unbroken.\" \nRELATED: Snooki officiates glam wedding of her longtime stylists (VIDEO) \nStill, those who've read it don't seem to hate it (\"While at times she is a bit too direct, readers will welcome the chance to get to know the new Polizzi,\" wrote Publishers Weekly ). And as much as we've poked fun at Snooki over the years, there's no denying she has a creative way with words. \nSo here we offer, without commentary, ten actual quotes from her tome. Whether these quotes compel you to go ahead and purchase said book is another matter entirely. \"I'm married, bitches!\" \"I read one passage from 'Fifty Shades of Grey' and had to put the book down to have sex with Jionni. He didn't know what hit him.\" Courtesy of MTV \n\"The first thing I did as a married woman? Took a s---. All the nerves and jitters — not to mention the Hot Pockets — just came out of me.\" \n\"The search for Saran Wrap while drunk on sambuca – trying to do it really quiet so my parents didn't wake up – wasn't the sexiest foreplay I've ever had.\" Photo by Seaside Heights Police Dept Via Getty Images", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:53:40.571+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
