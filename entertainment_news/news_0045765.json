Excerpts from the interview:\nDid you cut down on the number of movies lately?\nI have been listening to a lot of scripts daily but I have decided to be more careful about the films I choose. More than just being part of films, my aim now is to do roles that challenge me as an actor. I am 35 years old and the next few years are crucial for me. I want to take more time to decide on the projects I do.\nHas it got something to do with your previous films not being successful?\nNothing of that sort. I have enough and more films to do but after a particular point of time you want to challenge and rediscover yourself. I am now willing to wait for interesting subjects that can tap my talent as an actor. And it's not like I don't have any films; I have committed to three big projects for next year.\nDo you think lot of your characters, notably Vattu Jayan from Left Right Left, were underrated?\nThere were a few instances where some of my characters that deserved recognition weren't noticed. But I have no complaints. I believe that is part of cinema. Uncertainty is part of every actor's career. I am ready to accept it the way it is.\nBut does it discourage you as an actor?\nIt discourages you if you don't have films anymore. Fortunately, I haven't yet had to face that problem. By God's grace, the number of scripts I am listening to is quite high.\nHow important is it for an actor to rediscover himself?\nIt is every person's choice. You can do a job the same way you do now till your life ends. But after a point, some people realise the process is becoming monotonous and it's time they rediscover themselves. For me this is the best time to do it as I am almost halfway through my life. It's time I slow down and rethink my priorities. See, I am a person who loves doing films. Even when you say that some of my roles have not received their due recognition, people are now actually talking about it. So for me, those characters are my milestones. People compare my current work to those films. So, it's high time I set standards for myself and ensure my future work is on par with those movies and characters.\nYou and brother Prithviraj have completed more than a decade in the film industry. How has the journey been for you?\nThe way we both reached the films and our journeys have been different. We came into movies at a time when audience were receptive to new comers just like how it is now and filmmakers were ready to do films with us. I had two choices in front of me - either I could wait for a big film to come my way and start off as a lead or do character roles and grow steadily as an actor. I knew the latter was tougher as it will take a lot of time to establish yourself. Luckily it went my way. Right from the onset, a lot of different characters came my way. Also I was lucky to get such characters at equal intervals in my career. I was able to portray roles that were poles apart in back-to-back films. So the growth has been steady and I am very happy about the way I started and where I am right now.\nIs it true that you say yes to a lot of projects when it's done by your friends?\nNot necessarily. If I think the script is not convincing, I sit with them and discuss ways of tweaking and improving it. I don't immediately say no if it's a friend. Whether I take it up or not comes second. I take the effort of discussing ways of making it better. In fact, a lot of initial drafts I have read were not convincing but we discussed and improved it before starting production. I have always believed cinema is a team effort and it improves with team effort. But that doesn't mean, if a friend comes and offers me a terrible script, I would say yes just on the basis of relationship.\nBoth your wife Poornima and you are busy with your different ventures. Do you get to spend enough time with your kids?\nAs far as a guy from a film field is concerned, it's more about the quality of time you spend with your children than the number of days. Now that I am taking a break, I get to be with them more and spend time with them at home when they come back from school. Also we are all planning to travel together sometime this month. I am enjoying this time with them. I know if tomorrow I commit to two films, I will miss out on the time with them. So I am just making the best use of it now.
