Paul Hiffmeyer. Photo courtesy of Disneyland Resort, used with permission. On Oct. 4, Disneyland Resort raised its prices for its annual passes for the second time within an eight-month period. In making these changes, Disneyland has discontinued its Premium Annual Passport and introduced its new structures, the Disney Signature Passes.\nAs the Orange County Register has reported, the new passes now come with substantial price increases. The Disney Signature Plus Pass, the most expensive option, comes with no blackout dates for access to Disneyland Park and Disney California Adventure Park. It also comes with a hefty price tag: $1049. The new Disney Signature Pass, valid for about 350 days but with blockout dates around the busy Christmas and New Year’s holiday period, will cost $849.\nBoth Disney Signature Passes include complimentary parking and unlimited PhotoPass downloads, as well as discounts for dining and merchandise.\nA Deluxe pass, which has some Saturday and blockout dates during busy holiday periods now costs $599, an increase of $50. The more affordable SoCal pass, a discontinued pass option that is only available for renewal, now costs $459, up from $389. The SoCal Select has increased $30 to $329.\nAll Disneyland annual passes expire 365 days after activation. Renewal prices and fees for parking, whether for he annual pass or daily rates, have also increased. Downtown Disney has also adjusted its parking policies, offering two hours of free parking, with an additional two hours with validation for dining or visiting the AMC theatre, and an hourly rate of $12. This doubles the price of hourly rates for Downtown Disney parking, with rates now calculated in half-hour segments.\nA more complete look at Disneyland passes and prices, along with the percentage of increases, is available at the unofficial Disney fan website MousePlanet .\nThe Disney Premier Pass, which provides unlimited admission to theme parks at both Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney World Resort for one year, also increased in price. A new Disney Premier Pass now costs $1439 plus tax, an increase from $1099.\nGuests shouldn’t expect the price increases and changes to admission to stop anytime soon. The domestic Disney theme parks are busier than ever, with Disneyland annual passholders increasing by 250 percent since 2001, and increased admission prices are viewed as one way to manage crowds.\nIn a media statement, Disney spokesperson spokeswoman Suzi Brown said:\n“In addition to our continued investment in the guest experience and the expansion of our parks, our new selection of annual passes will help us manage strong demand and continue to deliver a world-class experience, while providing more choices for guests to select the pass that best meets their needs.”\nWalt Disney World Resort also changed its annual passes and ticket prices on Sunday. Its most expensive options are now called the Disney Platinum and Disney Platinum Plus, and its new Gold and Silver options – available to some but not all guests – also include blockout dates to address crowds during Orlando, Fla.’s busiest periods. Like Disneyland, Walt Disney World Resort last raised its prices in February of this year.\nWhat’s more, Fortune reports Disney might implement a price model for multi-day tickets based on demand for its U.S. theme parks. This model, similar to airline pricing, charges more for guests who wish visit the parks during busy days and peak periods, thus providing a financial incentive to visit during less-crowded periods.", "external_links": ["http://www.mouseplanet.com/11179/Disneyland_Park_Update_for_October_511_2015#NewsAndViews", "http://fortune.com/2015/10/04/disney-pricing-change/", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/disney-686033-pass-disneyland.html"], "published": "2015-10-06T00:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:49:11.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
