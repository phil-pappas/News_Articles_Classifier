(Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP, FIle) Sponsored Links NEW YORK — \nAndrew Rannells has a new gig — and it's a royal one. \nThe Tony Award-nominated star of \"The Book of Mormon\" on Broadway and HBO's \"Girls\" will temporarily replace Jonathan Groff as King George III in \"Hamilton\" on Broadway. \nRannells, who replaced Neil Patrick Harris in the title role of the show \"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\" last summer, will step into \"Hamilton\" from Oct. 27- Nov. 29 and Groff returns Dec. 1. \nWritten by Lin-Manuel Miranda, the musical about Founding Father Alexander Hamilton tells the true story of an orphan immigrant from the Caribbean who rises to the highest ranks of American society, told by a young African-American and Latino cast. \nRannells, who co-stared this fall in \"The Intern\" with Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway, will play a foppish and peevish King George, who sings three songs to his former American colonies like a jilted lover — \"You'll be back,\" he croons. \"I will send a fully armed battalion to remind you of my love.\" \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:47:39.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
