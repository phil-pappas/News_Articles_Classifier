Enter Laverne Cox as the infamous Dr. Frank-N-Furter. Laverne Cox to play the lead role in Rocky Horror re-make \nIt's possibly one of the most iconic cult films in cinema history, with Tim Curry having successfully forced viewers of all genders to seriously question their sexuality. It doesn't look like that legacy is going to change anytime soon either with the latest cast announcement. 'I am so excited to be a part of #RockHorror legacy', the 'Orange Is The New Black' star told her followers on Twitter , adding the adorable hashtag #DontDreamItBeIt in reference to the refrain from the original 1975 movie. \nMore: See clips from original 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' \nFor those deprived people who haven't seen the movie, it follows the story of an innocent young couple who find themselves at a bizarre mansion party hosted by a sadistic cross-dressing alien (from Transsexual, Transylvania) who manages to created life in the form of the muscly blonde bombshell that is Rocky. \nIt's difficult to tell how audiences will react to a transgender woman playing the part of a transvestite man, but there's no doubt she'll do the role justice if her other screen roles are anything to go by. \nThe movie was originally directed by Jim Sharman and based on the stage musical by Curry's co-star Richard O'Brien (the strangely sexy hunchback butler who leads the cast into 'Time Warp'). This new adaptation, set to premiere in 2016 on Fox, sees Primetime Emmy winner Kenny Ortega at the helm, director of 'Hocus Pocus' and 'High School Musical'. \nMore: Richard O'Brien returns to the stage version of 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' \nWe can expect it to arrive by the fall, so we're definitely hoping it'll hit the small screen in time for next Hallowe'en. Until then, seeing as this year marks the 40th anniversary, 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' is definitely worth a re-watch.
