After the Lucille Ball statue was criticized for being weird and scary, an actor has been portraying the statue and famous comedian in a haunted house at the Chautauqua Mall's “Haunting at the Mall” this month.\n\"It’s kind of a buzz around town,\" event planner Scott Mekus said of the Lucy coming to life. \"We want to be respectful to Lucille Ball, and we’re putting a Hollywood twist on it. It’s fun.\"\nThe “I Love Lucy” star, a native of Jamestown, was memorialized in a 400-pound bronze sculpture in a local park. But residents have hated it and started a Facebook petition to get it replaced, called “We Love Lucy! Get Rid of this Statue.”\nIn April, the sculptor, Dave Poulin, said he would replace it at no cost. But the town is going with someone else.\n( Photos provided by Scott Mekus )\nJoseph Spector Albany bureau chief: Joseph Spector is Gannett's Albany Bureau chief and has covered New York politics and government since 2002.
