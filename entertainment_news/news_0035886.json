Nargis had abandoned The Shaukeens when a Hollywood production company roped her in for a project — much to Akshay’s displeasure, since her dates were already committed to the film. There were reports that Akshay was mighty upset initially, but let go after sensing Nargis’ strong desire to work with an international team.\nNow, we hear that the two may come together for Rohit Dhawan’s Dishoom starring Varun Dhawan. Said a source, “Akshay and Nargis are most likely to do a cameo in the film.”\nMeanwhile, Akshay shares a very good equation with Rohit, who he worked with on the latter’s first project as a director, Desi Boyz. Akshay is known to maintain a good relationship with those he appreciates in the industry, so his decision to work on Rohit’s next film with Nargis may well be an off-shoot of that as well. We contacted Rohit to confirm the news of the cameo, but he remained unavailable for comment.\n Bollywood Akshay Kumar Nargis Fakhri Dishoom Also Read Gauri Khan refuses to answer questions on driver's arrest on rape charges Visaranai makes Kollywood proud It's women, music and champagne for Justin Bieber on wild 21st birthday Tutored witness led to false implication of Salman Khan, alleges his lawyer", "external_links": ["http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/TeluguMatrimony_Textlink_620x40px.gif", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151023/entertainment-bollywood/article/akshay-kumar-nargis-fakhri-bury-hatchet", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Akshay-kumar-bday-9_1_1_0_0.jpg", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Akshay-kumar-bday-9_1_1_0_0.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-24T15:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:23:46.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
