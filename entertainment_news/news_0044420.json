The Stubblr app for iOS combines geo-location and social components to help fans safely and easily find buyers and sellers of last-minute tickets near their location.\nThe game-changing, mobile-first app is made by fans, for fans. Stubblr was developed by avid sports and live music fans, Co-Founders Steven Rosenberg and Paul Yankowitz.\nYankowitz said: “We were tired of the practices and limitations of online ticketing platforms and having to deal with scalpers. We knew there had to be a better way, and thought we could combine the immediacy and transparency of apps like Uber and Airbnb to create a mobile-first ticketing platform.”\n“Our vision for Stubblr is to tear down the barriers established by traditional marketplaces, and create a safe environment that empowers buyers and sellers to transact directly in real-time. “\nUsers are already embracing the new approach, awarding Stubblr with dozens of 5-star reviews in the App store.\nThe app is available now for iOS with an Android version to shortly follow.\nSTUBBLR FEATURES\nPost ticket requests and deals\nFind buyers and sellers around you with geo location\nInstantly chat with users to negotiate and transact\nSocial profiles for verification\nDigital payments and buyer ticket validation\nDownload Stubblr from the App Store: http://bit.ly/stubblr\nWeb site: stubblr.com\nFacebook: /stubblr\nTwitter: @Stubblr\nInstagram: @Stubblr_App", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/stubblr", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL2JpdC5seS9zdHViYmxy"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:21:28.286+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
