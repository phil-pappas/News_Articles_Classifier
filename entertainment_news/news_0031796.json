(AP) - Some lucky music fans got to see two icons in the same room early Friday, as Prince performed for Madonna at Paisley Park.\nMinnesota Public Radio reports that about 30 Prince fans were summoned to Paisley Park late Thursday for something \"extra special.\"\nThe group was dancing to a mix of Prince and 1980s pop tunes when Madonna walked in, hours after performing in St. Paul as part of her Rebel Heart Tour.\nHer professional dancers and tour crew joined the dance party, and Madonna disappeared.\nShe emerged later, followed by Prince.\nHe took the stage and played a funky set, as Madonna sat on the edge of the stage at his feet. Minnesota Public Radio ( http://bit.ly/1FWargx ) reports that she looked up at him adoringly as he sang.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
