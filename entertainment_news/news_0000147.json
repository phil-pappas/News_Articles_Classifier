One day you are surfing the highs, rocking the tunes in St. Petersburg and the next, you're on the frontlines in the Ukraine. The life of a rockstar is complicated. It's also important to note that this never happened, and that's all anyone will say about that.\nWhat can be said is, after a gap of several years after the band's formation in the late-1990s, The American Bandstand Communist Brigade (Formerly The Dick Clark Five) reconvened in the early-2000s and recorded the album Fear of a Red Planet. It was never released, until now.\nThe American Bandstand Communist Brigade (Formerly The Dick Clark Five) consisted of rotating-instrument musicians Bunn-O-Matic, Model R-23 and Dr. Detecto; and was a subversive surf-punk trio formed in a basement in suburban New Jersey in 1996 out of members of The Bored Serfs and The Defenastrators of Justice, as one generally expects. The band was blacklisted shortly thereafter. The rest of the band's history is classified.\nIntroverse Media, via The Co-Op and Secret Decoder Records, is proud to represent the return of a band of no influence whatsoever, yet possesses a legend that will last the lifespan of a moth.\nWhen asked why now was the right time for the record to be dropped, bomb-like, on a surf-hungry nation, Model R-23 mumbled something about \"...deep background\" and \"a Billy Joel concert.\" Fear of a Red Planet features surf-punk tunes from a variety of cultural touchstones, peppered with pop culture references and callbacks.\nWhen asked if this signals a return of the band from obscurity to the spotlight, Dr. Detecto said \"...something about Bashar al-Assad\" and declined further comment.\nFear of a Red Planet is now available on Bandcamp: communistbandstand.bandcamp.com\nAbout The Co-Op\nThe Co-Op is an artist-supported collective devoted to shifting the balance of opportunities toward independent musicians. Presented as a subsidiary of Introverse Media, Ltd., The Co-Op maintains that the \"underground\" is just as vital, interesting, and unique as it has ever been and needs a bullhorn to make that statement clear.
