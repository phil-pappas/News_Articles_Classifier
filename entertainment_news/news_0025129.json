The owner of Nourish Your Soul (a juice and smoothie brand) recently opened her third retail location inside Healthworks in the Back Bay and with it will offer breakfast and lunch items alongside her signature juices and smoothies. The juicing queen has also added two new cleanses to her current lineup and two new menu items.\nThe Glow Cleanse ($50-$225) is a combination of juices and homemade cashew or almond milk during the day and a small, healthy meal for dinner. This less intense program is great for people who want to ease into cleansing. The Purify Cleanse ($75-$350) is for those who want a deep, low-sugar detox. Keep in mind, the Glow Cleanse DOES NOT come with food for dinner but you can either make yourself or purchase separately. Cabana offers loads of useful suggestions. You can even check out her Guide to Cleansing and Eating Healthier, for tips on cleansing, editing your pantry, and clean eating--available for $25 via nourishyoursoul.com.\nNew eats include Chia Pudding made with NYS’ signature almond milk, fruit and nuts, Local Greens Salad with Superfood Dressings (it's to die for)\nand Overnight Oats (best oats I've ever had), which are soaked overnight and loaded with nutrients.\nAs for only appealing to Boston ladies, Cabana assures us that men are welcome and have fully taken advantage of NYS' new location. She hopes to spread the good word about healthy living to all.\n“We are so excited to be part of Healthworks and reach even more people in the Back Bay,” said Cabana. “There’s a palpable positive energy in the gym that we are loving being a part of. We’ve seen the powerful change that can be brought by making good everyday choices, and creating a lifestyle that supports us.”\nNourish Your Soul - Upstairs @ Healthworks Back Bay , 441 Stuart Street Boston, MA 02116 , 888-99-JUICE\nOpen M-F 6:30 a.m. - 8 p.m., weekends 9 a.m. - 2 p.m. www.nourishyoursoul.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:03:26.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
