Image 32 of 32 Abroad in Houston: Festa Italiana 1 / 32 Back to Gallery Note: \"Abroad in Houston\" is a series where you can travel the world without leaving town. I'll be exploring the unique cultural and ethnic festivals, restaurants, districts and traditions that make up Houston.\nMeatballs, music, wine... It's hard not to get excited about all things Italian. That might explain why the Festa Italiana has been a mainstay in Houston for the past 37 years.\nHoustonians came out to celebrate the Festa Italiana at the University of St. Thomas over the weekend.\nItalian vocalist and pop singer Michael Barimo belted out the tunes this year. There was also wine tasting, grape stomping, and spaghetti eating -- exactly what you would think would go down at an Italian Festival.\nTake a look at the gallery above to see who was spotted in the crowd at the Festa Italiana.", "external_links": ["http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771980/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771981/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/45/8771961/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/45/8771954/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771975/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771975/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/45/8771959/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/45/8771959/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771989/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771977/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/45/8771962/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/45/8771957/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771977/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771969/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771968/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/45/8771963/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771985/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/45/8771954/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771986/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771981/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/45/8771966/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/45/8771957/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771983/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/45/8771967/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771984/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/45/8771963/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771974/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771983/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/45/8771960/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/45/8771967/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771968/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771971/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771972/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771978/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771973/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771986/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/45/8771961/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771976/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/50/8772141/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/45/8771965/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771971/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771982/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771974/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771984/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771980/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/45/8771960/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771976/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771970/8/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771985/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/45/8771965/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771982/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/50/8772141/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/45/8771964/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/45/8771966/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/45/8771964/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771969/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771972/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771989/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771973/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771970/8/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/45/8771962/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/46/8771978/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T17:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T17:36:24.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
