Jack Whitehall (Ian West/PA) \nSpeaking about the big night, due to be filmed on Friday November 13, Bad Education star Jack said: “It’s a tremendous honour to be hosting the Royal Variety Performance. \n“Having been lucky enough to perform for Prince Charles and Prince William in previous years I look forward to the opportunity of sailing a little too close to the wind in the presence of Prince Harry this time round. \nHe added: “It’s my third time on the show and I still am yet to perform in front of The Queen, she must be really desperate not to see my act.” \nThe event is staged in aid of the Royal Variety Charity (formerly the Entertainment Artistes’ Benevolent Fund), whose patron is Her Majesty The Queen. \nMoney raised from the show helps those people from the world of entertainment in need of care and assistance.
