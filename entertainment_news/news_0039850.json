The last one was at the Guggenheim in 1970.\nCurator Luis Perez-Oramas said Tuesday that the exhibit emphasizes two key periods. From 1923 to 1933, Torres-Garcia experimented with early-modern avant-garde movements in Europe. From 1935 to 1943 he produced one of the biggest repertoires of abstraction done in the Americas.\nThe exhibit runs from Oct. 25 through Feb. 15, 2016.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
