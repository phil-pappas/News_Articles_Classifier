'What do you feed that thing'. It's such a dad thing to say. When I found out people were hating on him for saying that, I was like, 'Are you kidding me?' What dad wouldn't be proud of that? It's not like he's saying it to an 11-year-old. I'm 21 years old.\" \nJustin Bieber defends his dog-throwing, dope smoking, Vanilla Ice dress-a-like thug of a father and daddy's embarrassing bro' comment on the size of the Biebs' penis. \nBecause what dad wouldn't be proud of that? \nBLATHER: \n1. \"Just the other day I hit my head on a rock when I was surfing. The difference is that in Australia, no one cares. In L.A., hundreds of people, including reporters, gather to capture that moment. My life is nowhere near as free and easy as it used to be.\" \nDoes this statement on fame from Liam Hemsworth make it sound as if he hits his head on a regular basis, or is it just us? \n2. \"They said, 'We thought you were going to be a d---.' Because that's the notion people have in their heads of child stars. People expect me to be an absolute a--hole. And when I'm not, that always plays in my favour.\" \nDaniel Radcliffe: wizard of reverse psychology. \n3. \"We just really like the name Elsie, and then we both love otters. They're very sweet and they're also smart. They use tools …they hold hands while they sleep, there's so many amazing things about otters. They're wonderful animals.\" \nZooey Deschanel explains why her infant daughter is named Elsie Otter — a child we suspect will be grateful the rest of her life that mom and dad did not admire warthogs or naked mole rats. \nDRIVEL: \n1. \"It's really helpful when you have Meryl Streep backstage at events shouting at people on your behalf, telling them to hurry the hell up because you have a nursing mother here.\" \nNew mother Carey Mulligan adds 'breastfeeding boss' to the list of things Suffragette co-star Meryl Streep can do. \nIs there an Oscar for that? \n2. \"When a baby shows up that person was meant to be here. And if there is one more meant to be here, or two more meant to be here, so be it.\" \nAlec Baldwin displays a worrisome level of ignorance about human reproduction. \n3. \"James is great. I think he's genuinely trying to do interesting things. Not everybody is. He takes a lot of flak for it, which I've never really understood. If he wasn't so handsome, I think he'd be celebrated much more.\" \nActor Chris O'Dowd suggests it might be James Franco's good looks and not his fantastic pretensions, egomania or leg-over behaviour that makes it impossible to take him seriously. \nInteresting theory.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:47:08.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
