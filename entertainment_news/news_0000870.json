I’m very excited and I can’t wait for people to see the movie.” \nThe 47-year-old made his feelings clear: “I’m just incredibly proud of the movie and the people who made the movie.” Daniel Craig at the Spectre premiere (Anthony Devlin/PA) \nTalking about the franchise, he said: “We just try and make them as real as possible. There are different sides of his character we explore in this one.” \nDaniel revealed that he’s not worried about comparisons to Skyfall’s success: “It’s a really good pressure to have,” he said. “I’m blessed to work with these people.” Daniel Craig as James Bond in Spectre (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc) \nDaniel also paid tribute to director Sam Mendes: “I love working with Sam. Our relationship has grown over these movies and I would work on any movie with him.” \nHowever the star, who also has a producer credit for Spectre, revealed that he’s rather shy: “I hate watching myself on screen, but I love playing James Bond.” Promoted stories Sam Mendes (Anthony Devlin/PA) \n“I’m very proud and I’m quite nervous, but I’m used to theatre where everything can go wrong,” the Bond director said. \nHe added: “I want people to like it, it’s as simple as that. I sweated blood over it for two years.” Lea Seydoux Lea Seydoux (Anthony Devlin/PA) \nThe French actress, who plays Madeleine Swann, looked awed. “I’m very proud to be here tonight.” When asked if she was happy to be a Bond girl, the star said: “It’s a dream come true. I can’t really believe it. I’m not a Bond girl; I’m a blonde girl!” Christoph Waltz Christoph Waltz and Judith Holste (Anthony Devlin/PA) \nThe actor, who plays Oberhauser, gave his opinion of the swanky premiere: “This is Bond, this is what one should expect for James Bond. \n“It was very hard work, it was long work, but that’s how it should be.” Dave Bautista \nSpectre’s Mr Hinx was asked how it feels to play a Bond villain: “I didn’t get hurt, I got beat up! It was worth it at the end of the day, it was absolutely worth it.” Monica Bellucci Monica Bellucci (Matt Crossick/PA) \nThe actress playing Spectre’s Lucia Sciarra said: “I wanted to be part of this tradition, there’s a huge tradition. Plus the chance to work with Sam Mendes, plus the opportunity to work with Daniel Craig, he’s a tremendous Bond.” Naomie Harris Naomie Harris (Matt Crossick/PA) \nThe British star, who plays Eve Moneypenny, was very excited about the film. “I haven’t seen it yet, been waiting to see it with my family.” \nShe added: “This is a premiere unlike any other, it’s huge and amazing and it’s amazing everyone has come out to support the film and they’re so enthusiastic about it, it’s incredible.” Andrew Scott \nSpectre’s Denbigh loved the movie. “It’s absolutely epic, I think people are going to go nuts for it,” he predicted. Ralph Fiennes Ralph Fiennes ( Matt Crossick/PA) \nThe star, who is a very human M, said of Spectre: “Great stunts, it’s very well crafted, it’s brilliantly made.” Ben Whishaw \nThe Bond franchise’s Q was asked why Bond continues to be popular: “I’m not completely sure I have the answer, but I think because everyone has grown up with it, it has this nostalgic thing and you know what you’re going to get, but it’s going to be slightly different every time.” \nHe added: “It’s just very deeply in people’s lives. I like his clobber, it’s not my favourite part of the thing, but I enjoy that everybody enjoys it, I love the acting bit with Daneil and with Ralph and Rory and Naomie, and working with Sam Mendes.” Share article Rory Kinnear \nSpectre’s Bill Tanner said: “It’s nice that they keep asking me. I don’t want this to stop.
