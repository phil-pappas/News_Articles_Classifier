Do y'know what I say to those bodyshamers? F**k off and leave my Chezza alone.'' \nCheryl, 32, previously rubbished claims she's anorexic and admitted the death of her husband Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini's father was partly to blame for her weight loss, but insisted she is fine now. \nPerrie's bandmate Jesy Nelson claims they understand what Cheryl is going through because they have all faced the same kind of scrutiny when it comes to their figures. \nShe told Yahoo! Celebrity: ''We just try to forget about any nasty comments really. We like to eat food and so does everybody else, and if we put on weight we put on weight and if we lose weight we lose weight. \n''Everybody has this preconception that you're supposed to be perfect looking but nobody is perfect.''
