You'll mostly find images of abstract subjects, often seen in everyday life, with a unique angle or twist. I also shoot professional portraits that have a similar unique, abstract twist to the approach.

The first step is to decide what you want your account to look like, which can be done through exploring the Instagram community. The second and most important step is to stay consistent with whatever that style is, whether it be of natural light in the kitchen, or fun pictures of your dog.

You can immediately distinguish Instagram users who do and don't use this rule of thumb.\" \n---", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T07:36:36.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
