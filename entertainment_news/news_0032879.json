Plenty, now that the \"Detroiters\" pilot is becoming a series. \nComedy Central announced Tuesday that it has given the green light to a 10-episode run for the show. It's the brainchild of \"Veep\" cast member Sam Richardson, who grew up in Detroit, and \"Saturday Night Live\" writer Tim Robinson, who's from Clarkston. \n\"A dream come true. Thank you @ComedyCentral!,\" tweeted Richardson on Tuesday. A dream come true. Thank you @ComedyCentral ! https://t.co/TVteQaS7XQ â€” Sam Richardson (@SamRichardson) October 20, 2015 \nThe two comic actors will play struggling advertising men in Detroit who make local TV commercials. In a Free Press interview early this year, they said they were inspired in part by classic Detroit spots like the \"Mel Farr Superstar\" and the Gordy from ABC Warehouse campaigns. \nRichardson, Robinson and former \"SNL\" star Jason Sudeikis, who will have a recurring role as an auto executive, were in Detroit in June to shoot the pilot at various locations, including sites in Dearborn and Livonia, Detroit nightspot Cliff Bell's and a downtown Detroit outdoor set near Fort and Cass. \nBoth Richardson and Robertson were adamant back in January about wanting the pilot filmed in the Motor City. \"The plan is to shoot everything in Detroit. That's really important to us,\" said Robinson. \n\"It's like the third character of the thing is the city of Detroit. Why put it anywhere else but there?,\" said Richardson. \nComedy Central hasn't decided yet where the series will be filmed, but the Motor City is in the running. \n\"Yes, we are still considering filming the series in Detroit,\" said Kent Alterman, president of original programming for Comedy Central, via email. Alterman said the original plan had been to film the series here. \n\"Now that there is no longer a tax credit (in Michigan), we are reviewing our options, but we'd still like to make it work in Detroit,\" he said. \nThe elimination of the Michigan film incentives was signed into law by Gov. Rick Snyder roughly a month after the \"Detroiters\" pilot was shot. \nBefore the program ended, the pilot had been approved for more than $445,000 in incentives on projected spending of more than $1.2 million. Those incentives, like others given the OK before the elimination went into effect, will still be honored. \nRichardson and Robinson's friendship began in their home state. They met about 12 years ago working for Second City Detroit and became fast friends. Richardson and Robinson also did improv at Planet Ant in Hamtramck and often return to metro Detroit for appearances at local improv events. Comedy Central's 'Detroiters' to shoot in the Motor City \nThe two later wound up together on the main stage of Second City Chicago, which has produced stars like Bill Murray, Steve Carell and Tina Fey. \nOn \"Veep,\" Richardson plays annoyingly cheerful political aide Richard Splett. Robinson, a former \"SNL\" featured player, has appeared recently in IFC's \"Documentary Now!\" \n\"Detroiters\" is being executive produced by Lorne Michaels' Broadway Video and Sudeikis, who'll play a recurring character as an automotive executive. \nProduction on the series is set to start in summer 2016 for an early 2017 premiere \nContact Detroit Free Press writer Julie Hinds: 313-222-6427 or jhinds@freepress.com. 1916 CONNECT 69 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/1RUeICo MORE STORIES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:23:23.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
