Following scheduled performances from a few A-list musicians, Rihanna stunned the crowd at the Hollywood Bowl when she made an unannounced appearance onstage and brought the night to a close with a surprise set. Donning a yellow-and-pink bustier under a pinstripe coat, RiRi played some of the biggest hits in her career during the Saturday, October 24 show. She kicked things off with \"B***h Better Have My Money\" and continued with older singles like \"Pour It Up\", \"Umbrella\" and \"We Found Love\" before closing out her set with a fireworks show that accompanied her performance of \"Diamonds\". The likes of The Weeknd and Sam Smith performed earlier that night. The Canadian singer's setlist included his No. 1 hits \"The Hills\" and \"Can't Feel My Face\" from his \" Beauty Behind the Madness \" album as well as older songs from his mixtape trilogy. Smith, meanwhile, slayed his own hits like \"I'm Not the Only One\" and \"Stay With Me\". The annual \"We Can Survive\" concert was started by CBS Radio in 2013. Proceeds from the event benefited Young Survival Coalition, which provides support for young women who are diagnosed with breast cancer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T09:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T11:09:24.834+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
