Tiffany Wolfe/For The Ledger, file Here comes success \nThe Ellwood City Revitalization group is calling its summer concert series a success, and this crowd at the Community Plaza shows why it is so. This was a Beaver County Symphonic Wind Ensemble concert in June.   11:15 pm Revitalization group wraps up summer activities, looks toward next development phase By Eric Poole epoole@ellwoodcityledger.com   \nELLWOOD CITY -- With the third year of Ellwood City Community Plaza's summer concert series completed, the borough revitalization group is focusing on future plans. \nOn Tuesday, Lenore Bazzichi of Ellwood City Revitalization called the concert and farmers market season a successful one and said the group is about to start Phase 2 of its efforts. Phase 1 was largely completed with construction of the Community Plaza almost three years ago. \nWhile Bazzichi said there weren't yet any concrete plans for Phase 2, the procedure -- with meetings for public input, followed by the discussion of plans and raising funds to execute those plans -- will remain unchanged, with as much transparency as possible. \nMuch of the activity in Phase 2 will involve modernizing the borough's century-old infrastructure, Bazzichi said. That, too, will follow the process used in Phase 1, when utility lines were moved underground and drainage issues were dealt with. \n\"We have to do it right,\" she said. \nBazzichi played down the prospect of streetscape-type changes, but she said she was encouraged by the announcement last month that the Lawrence County Commissioners were beginning a project to improve the front of District Judge Jerry G. Cartwright's office. Ellwood City-based architect Dan Franus, a charter member of the revitalization group, will design the facade of Cartwright's county-owned office on the 600 block of Lawrence Avenue. \nDuring her comments Tuesday, Bazzichi focused on what she called a successful summer for the Community Plaza's concerts and the farmers markets on Saturday mornings in the Beaver Street parking lot. \nShe said the concerts drew people into the Lawrence Avenue business district on Saturday evenings, a time when few people typically venture into Ellwood City, although a couple of the most popular shows were forced into the Leslie H. Sabo Jr. Auditorium at Lincoln High School because of bad weather. \nThe farmers market has also had an impact, not only by drawing people into town on Saturday mornings, but as a business incubator. Katy Mook-McGrath started out selling cakes, cookies, cupcakes and pies at the farmers market and now has opened her own bakery along Lawrence Avenue. \nOn Tuesday, Katy's Baked Goods sent some cupcakes, cookies and fudge from A1 Fudge, available at the same location in the 400 block of Lawrence Avenue, to the council meeting. \nBazzichi said vendors at the farmers market -- who don't have to pay booth fees because the revitalization group covers its costs through sponsorships -- are also satisfied with the weekly event. \n\"The vendors, they can't believe how nice the people are in Ellwood City,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T06:57:15.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
