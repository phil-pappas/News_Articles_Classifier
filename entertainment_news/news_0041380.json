Campos and LoCicero had interview access to Williams, Dana Carvey, Paula Poundstone, Bobby Slayton and other successful veterans, who offer nuanced thoughts about San Francisco’s important place in stand-up comedy history. Most comics from the 1980s either found careers in Hollywood, or stuck around to become victims of a comedy ambush after the market became oversaturated. The three still standing are portrayed like post-apocalyptic survivors — trying to make due in a stand-up wasteland, where the big clubs now feature TV stars, and comedy dinosaurs must learn social media or play at a senior citizens center. Another stellar scene features video evidence of Durst’s quick rise in the early 1980s, orchestrating a suspect Guinness Book of World Records stunt at The Other Café. (Work ethic and guile are necessary skills for surviving comedians on the local stage.) “3 Still Standing” is enjoyable for the archive footage alone. While the documentary is solidly made throughout, the filmmakers present San Francisco in a bubble, and the entertainment potential will probably drop steeply for audiences outside the Bay Area. (I enjoyed this film immensely, but I was invested — watching Durst and Brown on stage in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and Steele in more recent years.) Younger San Franciscans may note that the city has a thriving smaller club comedy scene and the wildly successful SF Sketchfest now — barely acknowledged in “3 Still Standing.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T02:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:04:38.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
