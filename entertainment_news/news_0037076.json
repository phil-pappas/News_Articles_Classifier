Photo: Jim Smeal, WireImage Image 51 of 51 50 classic mullets 1 / 51 Back to Gallery Major League Baseball took its time, but eventually addressed the problem of performance-enhancing drugs.\nThe MLB has been less diligent about ridding the league of mullets. It's true some of the longhairs aren't technically sporting mullets, but when you throw a baseball cap over long hair, you're conjuring memories of names like Jose Canseco, Mitch Williams, Randy Johnson and John Kruk.\nThe mullet still holds sway in professional hockey, though it seems to have largely faded from country music. The mullet will always find a safe haven in professional wrestling.\nThen there are famous folks like Rod Stewart (who releases a new album this week) and Mick Jagger (who is presumably sitting around counting his money this week), who have rocked the mullet for decades, convincing themselves that an expensive highly stylized mullet is not a mullet.\nAn expensive highly stylized mullet is still a mullet. Here are 50 of them.", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/04/60/37/1247177/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/04/65/53/1268449/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg",
