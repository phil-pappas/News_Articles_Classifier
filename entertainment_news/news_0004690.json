At once funny and poignant, screwball and incredibly smart, the script is nearly flawless. \nThe action takes place in the common room of a mental health facility called the Cloisters where five patients are anxiously awaiting a new arrival, Mrs. Ethel P. Savage. Savage is a very wealthy widow whose stepchildren are trying to commit her for her eccentric and philanthropic ideas of what to do with the $10 million left to her by their father. \nStory continues below Buy Photo Susan Suomi, as \"Mrs. Savage\", and Mary Carson Wouters, as \"LillieBelle\" .
