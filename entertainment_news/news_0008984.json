Africans relate to your stories and same with those in the Diaspora and the Caribbean and around the world,” he said. \nThe president urged the stars not to rest on their oars but take it as a big challenge to do more and add value to what they are already doing. \n“You are great African ambassadors,” he said and added that, “you must continue to achieve and surpass what you have today. You have made us proud.” \nThe Gambian leader urged the stars to see themselves as Gambians and take advantage of the land and build their future home. \nApart from Jackie Appiah, other beneficiaries of the land include Francis Duru, Segun Arinze, Monalisa Chinda, Patience Ozokwor, Eucharia Anunobi,Ejike Asiegbu,Tony Umez, Ngozi Ezeonu, Kanayo O Kanayo, Chika Okpala (Zebrudaya), Harry B Anyanwu, Chinedu Ikedieze and Osita Iheme. \nIn his response, leader of the group, Mr Francis Duru thanked President Jammeh for his generosity and expressed his colleagues’ gratitude and how humbled and honoured they are to receive the plots of land. \nMr Duru and his colleagues pledged to work hard to create opportunities for emerging and budding Gambian stars.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T05:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:01:50.273+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
