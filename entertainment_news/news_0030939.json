WP Films, the independent film studio behind the hit “God Adventure” films Finger of God, Furious Love, and Father of Lights, is officially releasing Holy Ghost Reborn , the sequel to the popular and controversial HOLY GHOST. The film was born out of the highest funded Christian Film Kickstarter campaign in 2013 that was intended for the creation of one film that eventually split into two parts. “These are very different movies from one another,” says Wilson, “but are also two sides of the same coin. Both were made with the thought: what would a film directed by the Holy Spirit look like? Where Holy Ghost was designed to get people's attention and make them ask questions, Reborn is really designed to capture the audience's heart. It is an emotional film, because the church has too often turned what was supposed to be a relationship into religion.”\nAbout Holy Ghost Reborn\nAlthough the scope of the film is indeed huge, with Darren filming in the middle of a massive protest in Rome, with a witch doctor in Africa, with prostitutes and the homeless in Brazil, amidst the ancient ruins of Greece, and even with a group of Navy SEALs, Holy Ghost Reborn is ultimately a film about one man’s search for the Spirit of God.\n“It’s the Spirit that created the Universe, but ultimately desires to reveal the truth of Jesus to all of us, individually. Darren searches for an invisible God, and finds a tangible friend who relentlessly pursues us all.”\nIn preparation for the release, in their latest “out-of-the-box-office” move, WP Films kicked off the release of its fifth film with a 9 city US tour, affectionately referred to as “Family Showings”, two months before the film’s official release. This was first time Holy Ghost Reborn was viewed by the public and was met with a tremendous response from audiences. Touted as “the most emotional and humbling film WP has made to date” Holy Ghost Reborn leaves no dry eye in the house.\nThe tour was followed up the launch of the Holy Ghost Reborn Worldwide Showings, where churches and independent venues across the globe screened the film before it’s release to their communities.\nAll this leading up to a no charge 4 day online movie marathon event dubbed “#HolyShareathon”. This event premiered October 17th, airing one WP film per day leading up to the release of the newest movie, Holy Ghost Reborn. #HolyShareathon saw record breaking traffic for the company with hundreds of thousands of new viewers tuning in to see the films for the first time.\nHow To Buy Holy Ghost Reborn\nThe film is now available at wpfilm.com/buyHGR as well as participating Christian Bookstores, Amazon, iTunes and Google play October 20th.\nAbout WP Films\nThe company was founded by Darren Wilson in 2006 when he began work on what would become his first feature length film, Finger of God. The company currently concentrates on creating feature films that are both creatively exciting and spiritually engaging.\nMedia Contact\nBraden Heckman\nE-Mail: bheckman(at)wpfilm(dot)com\nTel: 847-496-0142\nRELATED LINKS\nwpfilm.com\nholyghostreborn.wpfilm.com\nstore.wpfilm.com", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly9zdG9yZS53cGZpbG0uY29tL2J1eWhvbHlnaG9zdHJlYm9ybg==", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3dwZmlsbS5jb20vYnV5aGdy", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly9zdG9yZS53cGZpbG0uY29tL2hvbHktZ2hvc3QtcmVib3JuLw=="], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T12:34:38.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
