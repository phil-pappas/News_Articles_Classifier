The event presents fashion as art, and art as lifestyle, and gives international, independent designers, artists and filmmakers a platform to present their work to industry professionals, press, galleries, buyers, media and the public. The event debuted in New York in 2014 and in Los Angeles in 2015 to an enthusiastic response.
