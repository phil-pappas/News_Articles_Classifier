And we’re gonna make it 3D. I think this is going to be really special.”\nHe is thankful Paramount has agreed to the direction they wanted for the franchise.\n“It was great to be working with a studio who was comfortable with that… It’s not like they had to say yes to us. They were part of the decision making process to say, ‘Hey, let’s pick this up where we can, call it the end. (And) if you reboot it in some time when we’re all long gone, fine, but let’s not carry this thing and drive it into the ground.\nLet’s call this the last one.’ I’m really happy about that. It gave us a lot more room to play within the storytelling and also the time frame.”\nExpect “Paranormal Activity 5: The Ghost Dimension” to tie up all loose ends.\n“Yes, no more teasing. I think it’ll answer 99% of the questions fans have had along the way,” Blum said.\nActually, it was what made the whole movie an enjoyable proposition for him. “To finally not have to hold anything back but just answer everything… that was fun. Some of the answers we didn’t know, we had to make up, but at least they’re answers,” he said.\nIt was a meticulous process, Blum shared. “We went deep. We were really careful about it. Ashley Brucks, who is an executive at Paramount, at this point I would say of everyone, she probably has the mythology of all the movies – she was involved from the first movie. She’s been there on every single movie and she has the story of ‘Paranormal’ engraved in her mind and in seven bibles on her desk. She is the keeper of the ‘Paranormal’ story and when we’re doing story meetings and someone has an idea, if it doesn’t fit with one of the movies, she’s the first one to raise her hand and say, ‘You can’t do that because of the second movie’.”\nA big part of the finale is the marked change in terms of visuals. Where the first movie had one camera, the second utilized security camera footage, the third had fun things like the fan shot, and the fourth had the tracking dots, “Paranormal Activity 5: The Ghost Dimension” will be in 3D.\nBlum is hopeful about fans reacting well to it. “Found footage in 3D is, basically, unheard of. I believe that it’s a first. There’s never been a found footage movie in 3D before,” he said. “We’re going to explain why but… it’s hard to explain without giving it all away. The 3D was shot in 3D, let’s put it that way.”\n“Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension” follows a new family, the Fleeges – father Ryan (Chris J. Murray), mother Emily (Brit Shaw) and their young daughter Leila (Ivy George) – who moved into a house and discover a video camera and a box of tapes in the garage. When they look through the camera’s lens, they begin to see the paranormal activity happening around them – including the re-emergence of young Kristi and Katie.\n“Paranormal Activity 5: The Ghost Dimension” opens in theaters across the Philippines on Oct. 21.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:10:51.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
