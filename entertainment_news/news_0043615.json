night 1 / 29 Back to Gallery \nMaddie & Tae know the show must go on. Even amid downpours and flooding. \nThe country duo performed Saturday at House of Blues as rains covered much of the Houston area. And it wasn't just any show. Maddie Marlow is from Sugar Land and wasn't going to let anything dampen her homecoming. \n\"Houston! Thank you for braving the rain and making tonight magical! Get home safe! Love y'all so so much!\" the duo tweeted late Saturday night . \nMaddie & Tae struck a nerve with debut single \"Girl in a Country Song,\" which called out sexist country cliches. Wistful follow-up \"Fly\" was also a hit, and new single \"Shut Up and Fish\" is a clever flip on gender roles. \nThey're up for three Country Music Association Awards next month. \n\"It's mind-blowing for us,\" Marlow said. \"We still have to figure out what we're wearing. It's very, very, very important. This is going to be as important as our wedding day. These outfits have to be killer.\" Entertainment News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T18:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:45:13.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
