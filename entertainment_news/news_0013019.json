(BBC/Love Productions) \nIt was at nearby Challney High School for Girls that she was introduced to the world of traditional British crumbles, pies and pastry cakes by her cookery teacher, Mrs Marshall. \nFrom the age of 12, Mrs Marshall fostered her love of baking. ”I had to make puff pastry in my first class. I remember my teacher Mrs Marshall saying I was really good. \n“I got so into it that when Mrs Marshall used to prepare for her next class at lunchtime I would sneak in and watch her. She never minded. Eventually she said I could give her a hand. Over four years I got quite good,” she said. \nNadiya, 30, now lives in Leeds with her husband Abdal, a technical manager, and their three children, aged nine, eight and four.

Nadiya in her hijab (BBC/Love Productions) \nShe originally feared she would be dismissed as a “Muslim in a headscarf”, but told Radio Times, “I hope that, week by week, people have realised that I can bake – and just because I’m not a stereotypical British person, it doesn’t mean that I am not into bunting, cake and tea. I’m just as British as anyone else, and I hope I have proved that.” \nShe has become something of a heroine in her Luton home town, watched in admiration by young Muslim women and hailed by community leaders for helping to overturn prejudiced perceptions. Nadiya has won 2015′s Great British Bake Off (Mark Bourdillon/Love Productions) \nAfter nine years as a stay-at-home mum, she said it is “my time now for an adventure” and has begun studying for an Open University degree in childhood and youth studies.
