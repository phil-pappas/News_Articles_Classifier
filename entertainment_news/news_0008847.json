The series is Discovery Channel 's number one rated show. Attached is a sneak peek video of \" Gold Rush: Back to Mining .\"\nGold mining in the Klondike is a dangerous business. This season brings new challenges, adventures, equipment and power shifts. The drama unfolds in the treacherous Klondike, where men battle the elements, and each-other, to mine riches from the ground. This year there is said to be more gold than the miners have ever seen before.\nLast year, Todd Hoffman and his crew were on the brink of bankruptcy, but now they are back with gold-rich ground. Todd's crew is blown away by staggering goals set for the season. Three generations of Hoffman men work on the claim and try to give Parker Schnabel a run for his money.\nYoung mine boss Parker Schnabel mined $3 million in gold last year but he drove his crew into the ground in the process. Parker will have to draw on everything Grandpa John taught him in order to avoid disaster this season by figuring out how to be an effective leader.\nLegendary Klondike mining boss Tony Beets (\"The Viking\") is resurrecting his 75 year old mining dredge but he needs to actually produce gold. Naysayers think he is crazy to mine the old-fashioned way and Tony wants to shut them up and prove the old-timers had it right.\n\"Gold Rush\" is produced for Discovery Channel by Raw Television.", "external_links": ["http://www.discovery.com/", "http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/gold-rush/"], "published": "2015-10-16T23:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:48:10.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
