That is the one where all the costumed children, walking and in strollers or wagons, with their parents journey from wherever they parked to their favorite spot on the parade route. But for an event this popular, a little extra travel time can be expected. \nThe parade route went down School Lane, left on Rt 540, right on Rt 611, right on Dorrell Lane, and then right on Alloway Friesburg Road back to Rt 540. \nThe smell of campfire in the crisp air was just right for the season. Especially on a night where it's ok to skip through the tombstones, and play tag in the cemetery. \nLittle ghouls and superheroes waited anxiously for the parade to start while parents supplied them with snacks and glowing swords. \nThe parade route was over a mile long. And the floats filled in every bit of it. \nFollowing Parade Marshals Kaye and Bill Nichol were a caravan of insane and zombie dance teams, haunted scenes, tractors—with dog, and two big machines that fought over a log. \nChainsaws ripped through an elaborate scene and Miss LilyBelle Morris is the new parade queen. \nThere was Glassboro's marching band who played for the stand. Director Myers was there but somehow got canned. \nSwing a light sword, dressed as a Sith lord, hear the loud power of a old classic ford. \nElsa on flute, Peter Pan, and Maleficent. Wayne's World on sax—\"Party time, excellent!\" \nIt's a yearly event that's exciting and funny and seating is free so don't bring the money. Now you're aware of this festive affair. See you next year, return if you dare.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T16:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T19:54:18.804+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
