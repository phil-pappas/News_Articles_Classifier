Listening to the playback with Scott are, from left, Rob Pratte, Joey Granati, Rick Granati and David Granati. Joshua Franzos Dippy \nDiscovered by a team of Carnegie scientists in 1899, “Dippy” is renowned for being the first major dinosaur fossil in the collection and one of the most recognized dinosaurs in the entire world. There are nearly a dozen replicas of the original D. carnegii fossil in museums from London to La Plata, Argentina.

Andy Warhol Museum \nCarnegie Museums of Pittsburgh will celebrate 120 years by launching an online battle of some of its four museums’ favorite things. Carnegie Museum of Art, Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Carnegie Science Center, and The Andy Warhol Museum have each selected six artifacts, artworks or museum experiences to face off against each other in a public vote. After two rounds of voting, the final four favorites—one from each museum—will then go head-to-head to claim ultimate bragging rights. Here, a painting from the Andy Warhol Museum is one of the artifacts in the runnning.

Posted: Saturday, October 10, 2015 6:00 pm Granatis prepare to release single; comedy show headed to Center By Scott Tady stady@timesonline.com Timesonline.com | 0 comments \nLater Sunday, over a big bowl of pasta, the Granati Brothers will ask a group of friends and longtime supporters to help pick the single off their upcoming album. \nI already gave the band my pick, “You Can't Get Me Down,” a revved-up song about shrugging off negative people. Move over Rachel Platten, this is the Granatis' version of a fight song/take back your life song, though the band will need to snip a certain swear word near the end to assure any radio play. \nAt a private listening party Wednesday at David Granati's Ambridge studio, fellow guests Rob Pratte of KDKA-AM and Cindy Crawford, the Pittsburgh IHeartMedia reporter, both preferred “Shake It Up,” another rousing song where Hermie Granati sings as if his life depends on it. That song would be my second choice, though I also could make a good argument for “I'm Not Sorry,” which has a whiff of a Cheap Trick, power-pop sound. \nThe album's celebratory title track, “The Show,” also is destined to be a fixture in the venerable Beaver County rock band's shows. \nWith positive lyrics listeners can relate to, and David showing off his guitar sorcery -- he pulls out a vintage Rickenbacker to put some jangle in a few tunes -- “The Show” is an album that will satisfy longtime fans, and maybe surprise others who have doubted what the two-time Van Halen tourmates still have to offer. \nManaging to capture the vitality of a live Granatis' performance, “The Show” is a step or two above the Granati Brothers' last studio release in 2002. David and bassist-vocalist Joey Granati credit that to working this time with an outside producer (Jimmy Hoyson, an engineer on Goo Goo Dolls and Kelly Clarkson albums). It also didn't hurt getting some guest drum work from Gregg Bissonette, a member of Ringo Starr's All-Starr Band. \nJoey and David Granati say their music school, For Those About to Rock Academy, helps keep them in touch with fresh ideas. The program's young students should help make sure the Granatis follow through with their promise to beef up the band's lackluster Web presence, which can help publicize “The Show.” \nWith the soon-to-be-chosen single targeted for November release, the album will arrive early in 2016, when music fans will be craving new tunes. The band is kicking around the idea of combining their CD release show with the unveiling of a cookbook sharing Granati family recipes. \n\"We want to do some unique shows where we have music, food and jokes,\" David said. \n\"We want the meet-and-greet to be something where we actually cook,\" Joey said, \"because we know that would be legendary in itself because the Granati name in Pittsburgh is pretty much well known for food, too.\" \nLaughs in Center \nPittsburgh stand-up comedy-ace-turned-Q92.2-FM-jock Mike Wysocki will be looking for laughs Saturday at a comedy night at the Center Township fire hall on Brodhead Road, across from the Beaver County Humane Society. \nRegional comedy club regular Chuck Krieger headlines the \"Yappy Hour\" show, a fundraiser for the Humane Society shelter, with stand-up performers also including Brad Ryan and Sean Collier, a regular contributor for the WDVE-FM morning show. \n\"Mike, Sean, Chuck and I frequently do shows together,\" Ryan said. \"We did such a show for the Cambria County Humane Society earlier this year, and the event drew 300-plus people. I have three rescue dogs, Chuck has five dogs, Sean has two rescue dogs. So this event and cause is definitely something that we genuinely support and believe in. The shelter is always in great need of fundraising.\" \nShowtime is 7:30 p.m., with tickets $25 in advance at barksandbrews.org and $30 at the door, which includes snacks. You can bring you own booze, but leave your pets at home. \nCarnegies to Clash \nClash of the Carnegies starts Monday, an all-in-fun battle in which online voters will decide the most popular item at Pittsburgh's four Carnegie museums. Each museum will announce its six candidates Monday at carnegieclash.org . \nThough sources tell me the Carnegie Museum of Natural History will include its Diplodocus “Dippy” carnegii, one of the world's most recognizable dinosaurs, discovered in 1899. \nThe Carnegie Museum of Art will counter with a Vincent Van Gogh, “Wheat Fields after the Rain (The Plain of Auvers),\" from 1890, and “Little Boy Boxer” (circa 1945) from acclaimed Pittsburgh photographer Charles “Teenie” Harris. \nAnd don't count out the old and new, one-two punch of the Carnegie Science Center, with its Miniature Railroad & Village and Andy Roid, the first robot visitors encounter in roboworld. \nThe Andy Warhol Museum has plenty of iconic works and masterpieces to choose from, though I hear a few of their six picks will be underdogs like “Cat,” a circa 1954 illustration from the Pittsburgh-born artist that experts say presaged Internet cat memes by decades. \nThere will be two rounds of voting, with the winner announced Nov. 14, at a 120th birthday celebration at the Carnegie Museums of Art and Natural History. \nTidbits \n*Christian Beck of Freedom will warm the crowd for rising young country star Chase Bryant at a free Oct. 28 show at Jergel's Rhythm Grille in Marshall Township. \nIt's the Big 104.7 Halloween Party/\"Big Boo Bash\" so feel free to wear a costume. \n**North Sewickley Township bluesman Rich Harper released his new album, \"Ellwood and Me,\" last week. \nA day earlier, the album stood at No. 4 in pre-orders on Amazon's Acoustic Blues chart, trailing only Norah Jones and compilations from Son House and Muddy Waters. \nThat's good company. \n***That1Guy (aka Mike Silverman) will bring his 80-city solo tour to Club Cafe in Pittsburgh on Wednesday, showcasing a bass-ish instrument he invented. \nHe calls it The Magic Pipe, and while it looks like something out of a sci-fi movie, it's carefully crafted to cater to his aggressive and complicated one-man band techniques. Built from two, one-string instruments and a collection of sample triggers, The Magic Pipe combines electronic sampling and analog instrumental performance from an artist who lists atop his influences Rush, Frank Zappa, Dr. Seuss and Tom Waits. \nWatch him playing The Magic Pipe here: https://vimeo.com/99246804 \n****Blake Shelton will perform March 19 at Consol Energy Center. Ticket details will be announced soon. \n\"The Voice\" star last played these parts in August 2013, at First Niagara Pavilion. \nRaise your hand if you were at Shelton's 2005 show at the Pepsi Roadhouse in Burgettstown, when he graciously went on stage first, allowing his Beaver County support act, Dusty Drake, to close out the concert for a throng of hometown supporters. \nScott Tady is entertainment editor for The Times and reachable at stady@timesonline.com or on Twitter at @scotttady.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:23:53.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
