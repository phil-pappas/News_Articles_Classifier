Winfrey also has the option to acquire an additional 5 percent of shares.\n\"We believe that her remarkable ability to connect and inspire people to realize their full potential is uniquely complementary to our powerful community,\" Jim Chambers, Weight Watchers chief executive, said in a statement.\nWinfrey's appointment increases the Weight Watchers board of directors from nine to 10. Her term will expire in 2018.\nIn an August call with analysts, the company recognized that customers wanted to lose weight through a \"more holistic mindset\" involving healthier eating, fitness and emotional strength, and said it would develop a new market campaign to reflect this.\n\"We are expanding our purpose from focusing on weight loss alone to more broadly helping people lead a healthier, happier life,\" Chambers said in the statement announcing Winfrey's involvement.\n(c)2015 Los Angeles Times\nVisit the Los Angeles Times at www.latimes.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1740293&h=Oprah+Winfrey+takes+stake+in+Weight+Watchers+as+company+refocuses+on+wellness", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1740293&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1740293"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:05:40.447+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
