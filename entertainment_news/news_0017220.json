Gavino Garay reports.   \nSpace thriller \"The Martian\" is keeping the movies in business holding over its lead for the second weekend in a row at the U.S. box office pulling in $37 million. That brings its total sales to a whopping $108.7 million. And another strong holdover from last weekend, \"Hotel Transylvania 2\" that showed impressive stamina after raking in $20.3 million in its third weekend. Meanwhile, quite the misfire critics are saying of Warner Bros' big-budget fantasy \"Pan.\" It cost some $150 million to bring Never-Neverland to life... to later bring in a dismal $15.5 million in its opening week, according to studio estimates. With that, film commentators say we won't be seeing more Peter Pan anytime soon.  //reut.rs/1MmTYyp", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T02:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T13:35:25.636+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
