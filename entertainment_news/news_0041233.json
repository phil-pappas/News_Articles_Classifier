This group formed during last winter's popular classes led by veteran English teacher and historian Jean Lawrence. The writing experience was, for many, a life-changing positive experience, and plans will be discussed at the reunion for making it available again this winter for new students. In addition, an ongoing writers' group is being considered. \nIn addition to writing and some planned musical events, several high quality crafting options will be offered. Nov. 14’s A Bucketful of Maine is a hands-on workshop by Joyce Steel on how to make a keepsake assemblage with shells, pebbles, leaves and small found objects that hold warm memories of family and friends. \nA minimum number of registered students will be required for the class to run. Online registration will be available at medomakarts.org or by mailing a check for $30 to MAP, P.O. Box 374, Waldoboro, ME 04572. Each student should bring a small bucket or container of found items (clean and dry). Refreshments and art materials will be provided. \nMAP's Community Calendar page will continue to add more events as plans develop. MAP wishes to extend the offer of the use of this calendar to other organizations planning events of a similar nature in the community.
