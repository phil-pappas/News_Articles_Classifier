After an unflattering picture of the actor surfaced online over the weekend, Vin Diesel received a lot of hurtful comments. But the Last Witch Hunter star wasn't going to let body-shamers get the best of him. So he took to social media to respond to the haters. He first posted a picture of himself on Instagram with the caption, \"It is amazing the response from the journalists who I have been talking to for the last two days in New York. Today one wanted to see the dad bod. Haha. I am wondering if I should show the picture... Body-shaming is always wrong! What do you think? #LastWitchHunter\" Later on the actor posted a photo showing off his abs with the caption, \"The pic from yesterday... For those who wanted the show... For all the angels that love dad bod regardless... I will post an exclusive video on my Facebook when I am done with press today. #LastWitchHunter #HappyCreative\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T09:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:28:28.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
