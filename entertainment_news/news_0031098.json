This book represents his roots and offers lessons on how to live life on his terms.” “I hesitate with how much detail to provide when people ask me where I am from,” Gurdjian says, referencing her intricate geographical history. Gurdjian was born in Bucharest, Romania. Her earliest memories, she notes, were of “a brutal, oppressive communist regime.” In search of a better life, her family fled to Austria, where their multicultural and multi-faith origins were met with prejudice and distrust. They thus continued onward to Iran, a country that welcomed them and where they found acceptance, tolerance and a true home. The family lived in Tehran for 13 years until they immigrated to Canada.\nGurdjian and her family did not define themselves by cultural or religious markers. She saw herself as a descendant of talented and brave individuals who just happened to be Jewish, Christians, Armenians, Romanians and Austrians. The family endured two holocausts – Jewish and Armenian – and both of her grandfathers risked their lives to shield Jewish families from the Nazis.\n“No Labels” depicts how Gurdjian navigated life’s peaks and valleys amid a kaleidoscope of cultures and religions. This journey taught her resilience and how to prevail in the face on recurring adversity. Throughout, Gurdjian not only learned to embrace an identity without labels but to forge a well-lived life.\n“No Labels” was reviewed on Booklife .\n“No Labels”\nBy Monica Gurdjian\nHardcover | 6 x 9 in | 294 pages | ISBN 9781480821385\nSoftcover | 6 x 9 in | 294 pages | ISBN 9781480821392\nE-Book | 294 pages | ISBN 9781480821408\nAvailable at Amazon and Barnes & Noble\nAbout the Author\nMonica Gurdjian lived in Romania, Austria and Iran before settling in Canada.
