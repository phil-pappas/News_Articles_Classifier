But Cohen's enduring love of hard rock and heavy metal ultimately led to her career path as singer-guitarist Madame Mayhem. \n\"I've been into hard rock and metal my entire life, even when I was doing school musicals,\" said Mayhem, a Fort Lee resident. \"This is not an alter ego. This is me going under a moniker that I feel true to, and this is what I love to do best. Singing has been my life and I'm really happy that I can now do it in this genre.\" \nMadame Mayhem released her debut album, \"Now You Know,\" on Friday and performs tonight in Clifton. \n\"I'm really proud of the record,\" Mayhem said. \"I was able to work with some great artists and write from experiences in my life. It's a really good example of who Madame Mayhem is as an artist.\" \n\"Now You Know\" is a superb slab of melodic rock and metal that spotlights Mayhem's expressive vocals and dynamic range backed by a tight, all-star band. The album was produced by legendary bassist Billy Sheehan (the Winery Dogs, Mr. Big, ex-David Lee Roth), who also performs on the disc. He's joined by former Guns N' Roses guitarist and acclaimed solo shredder Ron \"Bumblefoot\" Thal, Korn drummer Ray Luzier and bassist Corey Lowery (Eye Empire, ex-Stuck Mojo). \n\"[Sheehan] has been a mentor of mine for a few years,\" Mayhem said. \"He's an amazing musician and person. It was a no-brainer to write a few songs together, and we made an album out of it.\" She added that her current backing band does a great job re-creating the music on \"Now You Know\" in a live setting. \nMayhem, Tenafly High School Class of 2007, has been performing professionally as a rock musician for the past five years. She said her stage name came easily. \"My parents called me Madame Mayhem growing up,\" she said. \"Chaos seems to follow me, and if you hang out with me for a couple of days some kind of mayhem will ensue.\" \nStandout tracks on \"Now You Know\" include first single \"Monster,\" \"Better Days,\" \"… After 2 AM\" and \"Sacrifice.\" Mayhem said \"Monster,\" a raucous rocker, is about the struggles of succeeding in the music industry. \n\"Through the years of trying to make it in this specific genre, people were negative and also trying to create an image for me that wasn't myself,\" Mayhem said. \"I just said, 'You know what, this is who I am.' \" \nThe slower-tempo \"Better Days\" and the pulsating \"… After 2 AM\" run one after another and make for a potent one-two punch. \"I wrote 'Better Days' when my mom was going through health issues, when I was hearing stories about friends being bullied and when I was having a hard time with certain people,\" Mayhem said. \n\"I wrote the song for my mom, for myself and my friends. It helped me writing it and hopefully it helped other people. You just have to keep pushing forward.\" \nShe said her classical theater and voice training have been invaluable assets for her rock career. \"I love to be a showman onstage,\" Mayhem said. \"Vocally, I know how not to blow my voice out, and I've developed multiple ranges.\" \nShe also listens to artists from all sorts of genres, which has helped to influence her sound. \n\"There are some voices, however, in the rock world that inspired me to accentuate my own, unique voice and not to imitate anyone else, people like Chris Cornell, Ronnie James Dio, Pat Benatar and so many others,\" she said. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:40:11.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
