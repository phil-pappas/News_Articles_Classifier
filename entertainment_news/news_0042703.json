If you weren’t at Friday’s Holiday Olé Market, the Junior League of San Antonio ’s annual shopping extravaganza at Freeman Coliseum, you’re already behind. But you can still catch up this weekend.\nOverheard soon after lunch on the first full day of shopping Friday, one woman asking another: “Can you carry all that?” She could and she did.\nGangs of girlfriends wandered the hall, flipping through racks of tunics, flashy earrings, sassy handbags and home decor items with a feminine twist. Husbands (mainly just mine) settled for a beer and burger to wait it out during the lunch hour.\nHalloween scarecrows and Christmas elves mingled like first cousins in booths featuring wreaths, wall hangings and kids’ clothes. Santas shared space with Day of the Dead hollow-cheek skulls while both soup mixes and fried pecans found their fans. Shoppers stocked up for the holidays — several of them — under a giant Eiffel Tower. This year’s theme is “A Joyeux Noel” and proceeds benefit Junior League projects.\nYou’ll get two more chances this weekend to join the crowd. Shopping continues from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 17, and 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sunday, Oct. 18. Single-day tickets are $10. Parking is $7 per vehicle.
