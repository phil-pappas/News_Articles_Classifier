Strictly Come Dancing’s Peter Andre (BBC Pictures) \nShe said on Chatty Man: “I saw Peter the other night and I asked him how many hours training he has been doing and he said about six hours a day. I said if you want to win you are going to have to up your game.” \nAlesha, who was paired with professional dancer Matthew Cutler in the fifth series of Strictly, admitted taking part in the competition was very intense. \n“I just bumped into Jamelia and she was like, ‘I’m so tired.’ It’s week one! It really is quite hardcore,” she explained. \n“We did about 10 hours training a day for four months. It’s full on. If you want to win it that is what you have got to do.” \n— Alesha Dixon (@AleshaOfficial) September 30, 2015 \nThe former Mis-Teeq star revealed how her fellow Strictly contestant Penny Lancaster used to help her to loosen up before the live shows. \nShe said: “Penny Lancaster… was amazing. She would come round and give us all a little bit of white wine, just a little bit just to calm the nerves before the show. \n“It was by far the most nerve-wracking thing I have ever done.” \nAlesha also denied that she had secretly married boyfriend Azuka Ononye, after she referred to him as her “husband” in a recent tweet. The couple are parents to two-year-old daughter Azura.

Are you crazy? As if I’m going to do that’.” she explained. \n“No, it was just a figure of speech. Lots of people refer to their partners as wifey and hubby, but never say never.” Alesha Dixon and Azuka Ononye (Doug Peters/PA) \nAnd she hinted she may even take matters into her own hands. \nShe added: “He hasn’t got down on one knee and done it seriously yet so. I might propose to him one day who knows? I would definitely say yes so he has got nothing to worry about.” Share article \nSarah Millican, Gareth Thomas, Gareth Malone and Morrissey also appear on Alan Carr Chatty Man, which airs on Channel 4 on October 2 at 10pm.
