The site is under Palestinian control, but Jews are allowed to visit for prayers under Israeli army escort.\nVideo from the scene showed flames leaping into the air above the small stone structure; Palestinian security forces put out the fire.\nMeanwhile, tensions flared elsewhere in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, resulting in at least four Palestinian deaths and dozens of injuries, according to Palestinian officials.\nA Palestinian man who apparently posed as a news photographer by wearing a vest emblazoned with the word \"Press\" was shot dead in the West Bank city of Hebron after he stabbed an Israeli soldier, the army said. The soldier was moderately injured.\nAt least two other Palestinians were killed and more than three dozen others hurt in a series of stone-throwing clashes with Israeli troops at several points along Gaza's security fence with Israel, the Palestinian Red Crescent said. Israeli troops fired tear gas and live ammunition when protesters approached a crossing point, Palestinian witnesses said.\nThe Red Crescent reported an additional Palestinian death during daytime clashes in Nablus, where the overnight firebombing underscored the religious sensitivities driving the current outbreak of violence in Israel and the Palestinian territories.\nPalestinians for months have been accusing Israel of seeking to change a long-standing agreement governing prayer access to a key holy site in Jerusalem's Old City. Israel denies it is trying to change the so-called status quo at the raised plateau known to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and to Jews as the Temple Mount in order to allow Jews to pray there.\nFriday Muslim prayers at the site, the most important of the week, are sometimes a flash point, but despite calls from the militant group Hamas for a \"Day of Rage,\" they passed relatively peacefully in the Old City amid tight security. Men under 40 were banned from attending.\nIsrael blames Palestinian incitement over the Old City shrine's status for the wave of attacks, mostly stabbings, that have killed seven Israelis this month. More than 30 Palestinians, some of them assailants, have been killed in the same time frame.\nThe Nablus episode threatened to exacerbate frictions.\nThe Israeli military called the firebombing of the Nablus shrine a \"blatant violation\" of freedom of worship and vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice and restore Jewish prayer access. Israeli Cabinet minister Uri Ariel, who has accused Abbas of spreading lies about Israeli intentions regarding the Old City shrine, called the arson attack \"a new low.\"\nThe attack on the Nablus tomb compound drew unusually strong criticism from Abbas, who denounced it as an \"illegal act that harms our culture, religion and ethics,\" the Palestinian news agency WAFA said. He ordered an investigation and pledged to repair the damage.\n(Los Angeles Times special correspondents Sobelman reported from Jerusalem and Abukhater from Ramallah, West Bank.
