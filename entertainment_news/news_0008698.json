Pic/Santa Banta \n\"For those of you who may not be aware, 'smize' is short for smiling with your eyes. To pull off a smize, you'll need to: squint, relax both your lips and eyebrows and then pretend as if a string is pulling up your face from above,\" Banks said, reports dailymail.co.uk.\n\"It all starts with the classic head tilt. Lead with your best side and work it,\" she added.\nThe model also insisted that your hair should be pushed away from the neck area to \"flaunt it\".\n\"Brush hair away from your neck onto the side you're leaning in towards, helping to leave your gorgeous neck bare. If you've got it, flaunt it,\" she said.\nShe then suggested that rather than taking a photo from high up, which people do to make themselves appear skinnier, it's better to take shots from below because it will \"accentuate the length of your beautiful neck.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:26:18.221+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
