Like I will be sitting around Googling childbirth”), her reservations about being “sent” alone to New York to record a demo as a teenager, and what she looks for in a man (“guys who are cultured… speak other languages or know things about other parts of the world or history”). \nMost interestingly, the article mentions that Miranda July asked a question suggested by her Nigerien cab driver en route to the interview: when is Rihanna going to West Africa? \nThe Barbadian star responded, “You know what? If I ever go to West Africa, it would probably be for a free concert. I would want to do something for the people there. Maybe we can make a whole event, the way Bob Marley would have done it. Just for the people. And if they climb over the gate, let them climb over the gate.” We’ll be keeping tabs on that one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:02:48.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
