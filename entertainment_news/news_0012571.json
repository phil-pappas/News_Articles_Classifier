Executive producer Ali Adler confirmed that Toyman, the classic Superman and Batman nemesis, who often uses toys and childlike gadgets to spread evil, will appear on the show. While Jeremy Jordan had been cast earlier this year as Winslow \"Winn\" Schott or Toyman's alter ego in the comics, there will be a twist to the character. Adler hinted that Jeremy had a \"relationship\" to Toyman, but they're not necessarily the same person. Asked why the show chose not to mention Superman, Adler replied, \"We do sort of say it,\" adding that they would refer to the Man of Steel as Kara's \"cousin,\" \"the big guy,\" and \"the guy in blue\" among other monikers. He, however, stressed that this show's about Supergirl, not Superman. \"But we all live in someone's shadow in our lives, and we're all second best to someone in our lives,\" he explained. \"What's amazing on this show is she gets to be at the forefront, so we're going to address where he is very quickly in the series. But it's her show.\" The freshman season of \"Supergirl\" kicks off Monday, October 26 at 8:30 P.M. on CBS, before airing in its regular slot beginning Monday, November 2 at 8 P.M. Melissa Benoist stars as Kara Zor-El a.k.a. the titular superheroine. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T10:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:40:12.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
