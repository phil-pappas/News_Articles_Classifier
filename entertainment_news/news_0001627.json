These growth areas include fingerprint technologies on the consumer segment, BYOD initiatives in the enterprise, and access control solutions in both governmental and corporate environments. This report, Biometric Data Security , ( https://www.abiresearch.com/market-research/product/1021708-biometric-data-security/ ) delves into these growth areas analyzing and suggesting both conceptual and technical security implementations.  \nAccording to research findings major concerns for biometric system integrators for the foreseeable future will be incorporating data security protocols, monitoring for incoming threats and establishing physical and logical integrity of the system. Data assurance, privacy issues, policy conflicts, encryption, fuzzy extractors, biocryptography, and template protection are some of the weapons of choice for administrators aiming to streamline data security in biometric systems. In addition, analysis contains cost-effective ways of template protection, end-to-end data accountability through system synergy, and BYOD security pitfalls. Vendor solutions mentioned in this report include Samsung's BYOD KNOX, HID's SDK ActivClient, ARM TrustZone's TEE isolation solution, and Precise Biometrics' smartphone security sleeves. \nThese findings are part of ABI Research's Biometric Technologies and Applications Research Service ( https://www.abiresearch.com/market-research/service/biometrics/ ) , which includes comprehensive research reports, quarterly market data files, and timely insights. \nABI Research provides in-depth analysis and quantitative forecasting of trends in global connectivity and other emerging technologies.
