There have been spoilers about internal conflict within the survivors in Alexandria and now Reedus says that his character Daryl is going to be involved in a dispute with Rick ( Andrew Lincoln ). \"A lot of characters that you didn't see having beef are starting to have beef,\" he teases the upcoming installment in an interview with Entertainment Weekly. \"A lot of mistrust, and a lot of conflict inside the walls of Alexandria on how that place is supposed to be run, and who's willing to trust whom.\" Reedus adds, \"A lot of things went down in the last season that are causing a lot of people to try to figure out who's going to screw them over and who they can trust. Alliances are being formed and a lot of the old-school loyals are starting to band together.\" He goes on dishing on where Rick stands in this situation, \"Rick is starting to shut the walls down. He's starting to be like, 'You know what, let's not be such helping people.' \" This apparently will cause the friction between the two buddies as Reedus shares, \"And he's coming to Daryl and he's saying exactly that, and Daryl's saying, 'I don't know, man, maybe it's worth it to go and find people.' It sort of backfired on Daryl. He doesn't look like he's in the happiest circumstances right now.\" Of how this disagreement will affect their relationship, Reedus says, \"There have been moments where Daryl's changed Rick's mind and Rick's changed Daryl's mind. They're definitely on the same side. Even when they disagree, they're on the same side. There's a lot of things happening right now, and a lot of people that Daryl didn't trust right off the bat that Rick did trust and maybe doesn't trust anymore. And Rick's sort of shut down those walls, he's closed those doors and Daryl's not sure if that's the way to go, or if the people Rick's trusting inside those walls are worth trusting.\" Talking about the zombies in season 6, Reedus teases a \"Daryl and Carol (Melissa McBride) moment\" as revealing, \"There's one particularly beautiful, gruesome zombie - he's got a lot of green moss on him. But when you see that episode - it's in episode 6, I think, that particular zombie - something happens, and it harks back to a Daryl and Carol moment.\" He coyly adds, \"I'm going to let you just guess what that could be, but there are Easter eggs in some of those zombies, so you'll see it in episode 6.\" The new season of \"The Walking Dead\" kicks off Sunday, October 11 at 9 P.M. on AMC with a supersized, 90-minute episode. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com More The Walking Dead News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T12:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:35:21.962+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
