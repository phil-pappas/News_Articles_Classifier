Wash out the inside of the jar. Wipe the outside, removing any paper label and glue. Air dry.\n2. Empty a few squirts of paint into the jar. \n3. Swoosh around the paint to get full coverage and cover the entire inside of the jar.\n4. Tip the jar over onto a scrap piece of cardboard, paper towel or paper plate to dry overnight.\n5. Take the lid and paint or color it to match your design, such as black for Frankenstein or green for a pumpkin.\n6. Glue a battery-operated candle to the lid. The lid will be the bottom and it will glow up through the glass. Don't use a real candle, as the paint may be flammable. If windy, you could set rocks around the lid to prevent the jar from falling over.\nMetal can luminary \nSupplies: vegetable can, spray paint or paint, drill with small drill bit\n1. Wipe vegetable can clean, getting rid of the paper label and any glue\n2. Spray paint or paint the can a color such as black for a bat or cat, orange for a pumpkin or white for a ghost.\n3. Draw, with a pencil, the shape you've chosen. If you don't feel comfortable hand-drawing the pattern you can download one from the Internet and trace it on the can. \n4. Using your drill, begin drilling holes by tracing the pattern. Holes should be made about every 1/8 or 1/16th inch. \n5. Add a candle, battery-operated candle or glow sticks to the inside when ready to light up.\nDon't have a drill?: Forget the holes and just paint the can and let the light glow out the top. Try painting the can white, orange and yellow like candy corn.\nBrown bag luminary \nSupplies: Brown paper lunch bags, permanent black marker or paint\n1. With your bag flat, trace an image, using pencil so you can erase it, on the front of the bag. You can download an image, or draw by hand, a witch on a broom, a pumpkin face or you can write Halloween phrases like \"enter if you dare\" over several bags.\n2. Using a permanent black marker, trace and color in your designs.\n3. Add rocks or sand to the bottom of the bags to prevent them from blowing over, as well as a battery-operated candle or glow sticks. Don't use a real candle, as it could set fire to the bag.\nTip: Patterns can also be made using a hole punch, paint-over stencils or cut-out patterns like pumpkin faces.\nMilk jug luminary \nSupplies: Milk jug (plastic one-gallon jugs work best), permanent black marker\n1. Wash out milk jug with water and dish soap. Wipe around the outside. Let air dry.\n2. Paint the lid or color it with black marker and set aside.\n3. With a pencil, make a ghost, pumpkin or Frankenstein face on the front, flat side of the jug. Or you can paint or spray paint the entire jug a color.\n4. Color in a face or a Halloween phrase or word like \"Boo\" with black marker or paint.\n5. Cut a small flap in the back of the jug down near the bottom center.\n6. Place a few rocks or sand on the bottom for stability.\n7. Add a battery-operated candle, several glow sticks or holiday lights, colored or white, into the jug. Don't use a real candle as it will melt the plastic.\nWrapped paper luminary \nSupplies: Sheet of paper (colored or plain, based on your design); scissors, marker (choose based on paper color), clear tape\n1. Choose a jar to fit your design. Tip: Baby food jars or peanut butter jars work great.\n2. Take your paper and trace the size of the jar. Cut paper to fit jar size. Leave a space in the back.\n3. Lay paper flat and trace or draw a ghost face on white paper with a black marker, or perhaps a black bat with a white marker.\nTip: Get creative. You don't have to go with the basic orange, black and white colors. Choose a funky pattern and make a funny pumpkin face or scary cat.\n4. Once you have your pattern ready, wrap the paper around the jar and place a small piece of tape over the two sides of the paper and the small space left to adhere it to the jar.\n5. Place a candle, battery-operated candle or glow sticks inside the jar. You may need to also place sand or a few rocks inside to keep it from tipping over, if the jar is tall.\nclane@timesunion.com•518-454-5436•@tiredorinspired", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:55:01.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
