(AP) — A new independent film recounts the faith and unity of a Birmingham, Alabama, high school football team in the years after integration. \nAndrew Erwin, co-director of the film “Woodlawn,” was on hand for a special screening for Woodlawn High School students Thursday. Erwin and his brother, Jon Erwin, began producing the film in 2014. Parts of it were shot at the high school and at Legion Field, where a 1974 game between Woodlawn and Banks High School drew more than 40,000 spectators. The turnout was the largest ever for an Alabama high school football game. \nThe film focuses on the impact religious fellowship had in unifying black and white members of Woodlawn High School’s football team in the early 1970s during lingering opposition to integration. The movie also highlights the relationship between coach Tandy Gerelds and Tony Nathan, who went on to play for the University of Alabama and in the NFL. Nathan was among the University of Alabama’s first black football players. \nSCHOOL PRAYER \nRankin schools lawyer denies teacher insulted atheists \nJACKSON, Miss. (AP) — A lawyer for Mississippi’s Rankin County school district denies that a high school teacher insulted atheists in class. \nFred Harrell Jr. told The Associated Press Wednesday that the American Humanist Association got the facts wrong in a complaint letter that it publicly circulated Tuesday. \nHe says that world history teacher, Rick Hammarstrom, was not voicing his own opinion when he was alleged to have said “you are a fool if you don’t believe in God.” Harrell says Hammarstrom was quoting a lawyer’s statement during a class discussion. \nHarrell says he’s still investigating what happened, but blasts the humanist group, which earlier sued the Rankin district for improperly promoting Christianity in school. Harrell says the group should have approached officials in Mississippi’s third-largest school district before releasing the letter naming Hammarstrom. \nCHURCH KILLING \nLawyer: Mom too meek to stop fatal beating of son in church \nNEW HARTFORD, N.Y. (AP) — An attorney for a woman charged with manslaughter in a deadly assault on her teenage son at a New York church says he believes other people caused the fatal injuries and she didn’t have the emotional strength to intervene. \nLawyer Devin Garramone said Thursday the confrontation “spun out of control” and Deborah Leonard “didn’t have the temerity” to stand up to others in a church where she’d worshipped for 30 years. \nNineteen-year-old Lucas Leonard died and his 17-year-old brother, Christopher, was seriously injured after being beaten Sunday at the Word of Life church in New Hartford. The police chief has said a spiritual “counseling session” turned violent. \nBut a lawyer for the father, Bruce Leonard, said the incident stemmed from a family meeting that had nothing to do with the church. The teen’s parents are charged with manslaughter. Four other people, including the boys’ 33-year-old sister, face assault charges. All have pleaded not guilty. \nSound: \n288-w-32-(Julie Walker, AP correspondent, with Devin Garramone (GEHR’-uh-mohn), attorney for Deborah Leonard, mother charged with son’s death)–Parents charged with beating their teen son to death inside a church are giving diverging versions of what happened.

Abraham Esper leads a Catholic church adjacent to the Word of Life church. That’s where the beatings happened Sunday in New Hartford. \nEsper said Thursday he’d had little contact with Word of Life, except in letters he wrote complaining about barking dogs there. Word of Life also housed some of its members. \nEsper found it unusually unwelcoming for a church, with no worship times posted and no bell or even knob on its closed front door. \nBut resident Sarah Gendron says she found Word of Life “cool” and “very family-oriented” when she attended a service eight years ago. \nSound: \n243-a-07-(Valerie Giannatelli (jahn-uh-TEHL’-ee), neighbor of the church, in AP interview)-“in middle school”-Valerie Giannatelli, who’s run a day care center near the Word of Life Church for 19 years, says she’s heard stories of the church being run like a cult.

They say he had been sleeping in a makeshift bed inside the attic at the Saint Ann Roman Catholic Church in Arlington. Authorities say they also found food, water, a guitar and clothing in the room. \nPolice spokesman Dustin Sternbeck says Barker’s room was discovered after someone working in maintenance repair heard noises from above in the kitchen area. \nPolice say Barker told officers that he would use a ladder to sneak up to the attic. \nIt isn’t immediately clear if Barker has an attorney. \nBIKE LANE-CHURCH \nWashington church opposes bike lane, cites religious freedom \nWASHINGTON (AP) — A Washington D.C. church says a proposed bike lane near its property would infringe on its constitutional rights of religious freedom by causing traffic problems and making it harder for people to reach a place of worship. \nThe Washington Post reports that the District Department of Transportation is considering installing a protected bike lane near the United House of Prayer. The church is located near Mount Vernon Square. \nThe church’s lawyer wrote a letter to the department saying the loss of parking caused by the bike lane would place an undue burden on people who want to pray. The church says other churches already have had to flee to the suburbs because of parking restrictions. \nThe department says no decision will be made until it decides on a street and design approach. \nVIETNAM-US-RELIGIOUS FREEDOM \nVietnam slams US over annual religious freedom report \nHANOI, Vietnam (AP) — Vietnamese leaders say the U.S. State Department’s annual religious freedom report contains errors and is not objective about their country. \nThe report’s section on Vietnam says government authorities, particularly at the local level, have continued to limit the activities of unregistered religious groups. It also says believers reported convictions, assaults, excessive use of force, detentions, monitoring, hindering of movement, denials of registrations and other harassment. \nThe State Department report says Mennonite pastors in southern Vietnam reported that government forces raided a Bible class in June and subsequently detained 29 pastors and 47 students, who were beaten before authorities released them the following day. \nAt a press briefing in Hanoi Thursday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Le Hai Binh defended Vietnam’s religious freedom record.

(AP) — South Dakota regulators have approved a secretive polygamous group’s request to draw water more quickly at its remote Black Hills compound even though the sect declined to provide many details about the number of people living there. \nThe state Water Management Board on Wednesday approved the application by Seth Jeffs of the United Order of South Dakota, a religious trust run by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, or FLDS. The church teaches that polygamy brings exaltation in heaven. \nSeth Jeffs’ brother, FLDS leader Warren Jeffs, is serving a life sentence in Texas for assaulting two of his child brides. \nSeth Jeffs pleaded guilty in 2006 to harboring Warren Jeffs as a fugitive. \nBoard members who voted to approve the application said that despite the South Dakota group’s lack of candor, it met the legal burden to access additional water. \nMUSLIM PRAYER ROOM-UNIVERSITY \nMuslim students ask for prayer room at Colorado university \nBOULDER, Colo.

They recently delivered a petition for a private prayer room to campus leaders. \nCampus spokesman Bronson Hilliard says the university officials are looking at what kind of space they could legally create. He says they can’t label something a prayer room or put any permanent faith symbol on it. \nHilliard says such a room would probably be a designated space for quiet activities and reflection. \nCHAD-VEIL-ARRESTS \nChad police arrest 62 women for wearing full veils \nDAKAR, Senegal (AP) — Chad’s police spokesman says police have arrested 62 women for wearing full veils in public as the African country steps up security against extremism following a multiple suicide bombing attack. \nPaul Manka said Thursday the first major arrests of women were carried out in the capital, N’djamena (en-jah-MIHN’-ah), since Wednesday in line with anti-terrorism measures. Chadian authorities banned wearing full veils or burkas in public places in June to prevent jihadi attacks, especially by the Nigerian Islamic group Boko Haram. \nThe extremist group used women and children to carry out five suicide bombings in a village near Lake Chad on Saturday, killing at least 36. \nManka said the women would be released after paying a $170 fine. He said if they are repeatedly arrested they will be charged with complicity with jihadis.
