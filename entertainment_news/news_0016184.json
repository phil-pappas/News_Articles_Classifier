They gave me one of those things, like a nomination, two or three times. A nomination is plenty.\" \nBlack Mass received raved reviews after it was screened at the Venice Film Festival in Italy last month, and many critics have held Johnny up as a top pick for the Best Actor Oscar at next year's ceremony. \nThe film tells the story of real life criminal Whitey Bulger, 86, who went on the run from authorities in 1995 and became one of America's most-wanted fugitives. He was finally captured in California in 2011 after 16 years on the run, and is currently serving life in prison. \nJohnny previously revealed he had hoped to speak to Bulger in person as part of his research for the film, but the Boston crime boss turned him down. \n\"I don't believe he was a great fan of the book (the film is based on),\" he said. \nBlack mass was adapted from Dick Lehr and Gerry O'Neill's bestselling 2001 book Black Mass: The True Story Of An Unholy Alliance Between The FBI And The Irish Mob.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T20:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:54:43.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
