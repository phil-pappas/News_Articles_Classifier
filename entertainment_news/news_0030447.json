With her flamethrower voice, lead singer Florence Welch will have no problem filling that cavernous room.\nIt also makes sense because plenty of people are going to snatch up tickets. The group’s 2015 album “How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful” was its first to hit No. 1 on the U.S. Billboard 200, and lead single “Ship To Wreck” cracked the top 10 in Billboard’s rock airplay, alternative and adult alternative categories.\nCall Florence + the Machine an “indie rock band” if you must, but don’t let those Billboard charts fool you — this is pop music, smartly designed and executed with the professional gloss that often comes by the time a band reaches its third album. Thrumming brass arranged by Goldfrapp’s Will Gregory (a fellow Brit) pushes the bouncing pop of “Queen of Peace” forward, and makes quiet moments like the one found on “St. Jude” even more effective.\nOn that song, Welch ponders whether she has “always been more comfortable in chaos.” Perhaps it’s true, but for Welch and her band, the chaos clearly remains contained within.\nMost Read Stories 5 ways CaliBurger is better than In-N-Out Seattle Seahawks fan: Why I'm flipping the switch and turning off my loyalties to this team Files for lawsuit against CIA stolen in 'suspicious' break-in at UW Seattle Mariners hire Scott Servais as manager, expected to name Tim Bogar bench coach Bill the Butcher workers still seeking CEO who vanished with their pay Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. 8 p.m. Tuesday, Oct. 27, at KeyArena, 305 Harrison St., Seattle; $26.50-$66.50 (206-684-7200 or keyarena.com ).\nOwen R.
