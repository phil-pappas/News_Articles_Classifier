Bruce Lee - The Fighter (U/A): Book Your Tickets Right Away! \nIt is known that the actor's last release did not actually spill much magic considering its box office performance and his forthcoming release Bruce Lee draws a lot of trade expectations. \nApparently, Baahubali evidently increased the Telugu box office potential and has brought in some kind of pressure on Bruce Lee, as it is expected to pull off the same stamina like Srimanthudu managed to do. \nBruce Lee is releasing in more than 2200 screens worldwide and has number of attractions including Megastar Chiranjeevi's cameo, which itself is a great crowd pulling factor. \nSo, according to the trade estimates, Ram Charan-Sreenu Vaitla's Bruce Lee must atleast enter the list of top 5 Telugu movies, to actually prove the Megapower Star's box office potential. \nIncreased ticket rates also adds as a bonus for the probable records of Bruce Lee . In this scenario, there are several discussions going on among fan clubs as in which film from current Top 5 looses its place for Bruce Lee. \nOn that note, Check out the list of current all time top 5 industry hits of Telugu movies and their collections, in the slides below. Will Bruce Lee Enter The List Of Top 5 Telugu Movies? 1/7 Baahubali \nBaahubali Telugu version collected a total share of 186 Cr worldwide after it's full run and stood as the all time industry hit of Telugu cinema. Will Bruce Lee Enter The List Of Top 5 Telugu Movies? 2/7 Srimanthudu \nSrimanthudu stood tall next to Baahubali in the second place by collecting approximately 81 Cr share world wide. Will Bruce Lee Enter The List Of Top 5 Telugu Movies? 3/7 \nAttarintiki Daredi collected a share of 74 Cr worldwide and is holding the third position. Will Bruce Lee Enter The List Of Top 5 Telugu Movies? 4/7 Magadheera \nMagadheera was in the Top 5 films of TFI for a long time now with a worldwide share of 71 Cr, which marks its place at number 4. Will Bruce Lee Enter The List Of Top 5 Telugu Movies? 5/7 \nPawan Kalyan's Gabbar Singh is in fifth place with a share of 61 Cr worldwide. Will Bruce Lee Enter The List Of Top 5 Telugu Movies? 6/7 Bruce Lee \nIf the film manages to replace Srimanthudu then four out of top 5 would be of Mega films. If Bruce Lee replaces AD, MD or GS then it is a mega win on mega. Meanwhile, leave your guesses in the comment box below.
