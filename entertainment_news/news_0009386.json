The character is based in part off one of Bachelor's Vine personas, and Key and Peele will executive produce the show alongside Key & Peele writer Alex Rubens, according to a report today in Deadline .\nKey and Peele ended their three-year, five-season run on Comedy Central last month to focus on other projects. Their departure has resulted in heightened speculation as to where the two would focus their socially conscious and often absurd cultural commentary. The two are keeping busy, new comedy shows aside. Key and Peele are working with director and writer Judd Apatow on a feature-length film, and both have separately lined up a series of TV and film gigs for the foreseeable future.\n\"KingBach\" is the most popular Vine star with more than 5 billion loops\nBachelor, who is the number-one star on Vine with more than 5 billion video loops and 14 million followers, has parlayed his viral popularity into a traditional career in Hollywood, with appearances on House of Lies and The Mindy Project . For Key and Peele, teaming up with the social-video expert is a no-brainer. The duo's Comedy Central sketches have become viral YouTube phenomenon months and even years after their originals tapings. So tapping into the kind of humor Bachelor's cultivated on Vine and mashing it up with a broadcast sitcom format will be an interesting fusion of talent.", "external_links": ["https://vine.co/KingBach", "http://deadline.com/2013/11/key-peele-partners-team-with-judd-apatow-for-universal-pitch-deal-634256/", "http://deadline.com/2015/10/keegan-michael-key-jordan-peele-andrew-bachelor-vine-king-bach-comedy-fox-1201574507/"], "published": "2015-10-12T21:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:51:26.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
