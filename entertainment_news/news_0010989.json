While revenues grew 23 percent from a year ago, profits were halved.\nNetflix raised prices in the US and several other countries in the past week, saying it was needed \"to improve our ability to acquire and offer high quality content.\" \nIt has been expanding its original content as it faces increasing competition from rivals such as Hulu, Amazon and HBO.\nNetflix executives, believe that \"linear networks that embrace on demand and Internet delivery as we have, will become more valuable and will experience renewed growth,\" the letter said.\n\"The secular shift to on-demand consumption is best described as 'consumers evolving vs. old habits' rather than 'Netflix vs. traditional media.' We're all racing to fulfill consumer desires.\"\nInvestment & Company Information Finance Netflix", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:31:01.334+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
