Join the Conversation \nWhere will we shop for diaper bags that cost $860 now? \nBedford resident Blake Lively has announced that she is shutting down her lifestyle/shopping website Preserve.us, just one year after she introduced it as \"part magazine, part e-commerce hub, part philanthropic endeavor and above all, a place to showcase the power of imagination, ingenuity, quality, and people.\" \n“We have an incredible team of people who do beautiful work, but we launched the site before it was ready, and it never caught up to its original mission: It’s not making a difference in people’s lives, whether superficially or in a meaningful way,” she said in an interview with Vogue. “And that’s the whole reason I started this company, not just to fluff myself, like, ‘I’m a celebrity! People will care what I have to say!’ It was so never meant to be that, and that kind of became the crutch because it was already up and already running, and it’s hard to build a brand when you’re running full steam ahead--how do you catch up?” \nThe website will go offline on October 9, but Lively isn't giving up on her dreams. Ryan Reynolds' entrepreneurial wife told Vogue she plans to rebuild, rebrand and return with a better product.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T15:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T11:39:52.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
