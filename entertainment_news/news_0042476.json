Lion's head meatballs are a typical Shanghai treat. John O'Boyle|For NJ Advance Media \nThere are possibilities for all levels of adventure. The really bold can dive into stir-fried pork kidneys with sesame oil ($13), fish head with tofu (market price) and sauteed shredded eel in brown sauce ($26) as well as a host of other exotic choices. \nNo one has to stretch that far out of their comfort zone, however, to get a taste of what Shanghai preparations are all about. The chunky lion's head meatballs in a soy-based casserole with greens ($16) are filling comfort food, while pan-fried whole flounder (market price) is embellished with ginger and scallion soy sauce to offer a multi-level sensation. \nDon't miss the wonderful steamed juice buns with crabmeat ($8), but eat them carefully to get the full effect of the soup bursting into your mouth as you nibble through their soft skin. I could make a meal out of these darlings, served as an appetizer. Steamed juice buns are a delight at Shanghai 46 restaurant. John O'Boyle|For NJ Advance Media \nFor the uninitiated, photos of major items offer a perspective beyond the terse printed descriptions, though more information would have been helpful in some cases. Spices are calibrated with pepper icons signifying which dishes are \"very little spicy\" to very spicy, so patrons can order accordingly. Many choices are without icons, which means those with issues about the amount of zing they can handle should have no worries going in that direction. \nSweetness, like the liberal use of alcohol, is a characteristic of food served in the region where Shanghai is located. The spare ribs with a sweet brown sauce ($13) went far beyond the usual barbeque-style sauce to the point where it was too cloying for my taste, but I think that's something to which one has to be accustomed. At the other end of the scale, we found some items, such as sauteed fresh lily bulbs with celery ($12.95), to be a little bland. \nCrispy fried duck ($17) wasn't as alluring on the plate as it was in its photo. It could have used a demarcation from more spices. I suspect it was meant to be eaten in conjunction with other dishes, which would have given it some definition. In the same vein, the plate of smoked fish ($8) was enormous to the point of nearly being overwhelming on its own. \nAs to the authenticity of the meal, it was testimony enough for us that practically everyone in the bustling restaurant was Asian, from couples to families and a table that was celebrating a birthday with an enormous assortment of colorful appetizers and entrees. \nDishes from other Asian countries are listed on an Asian fusion page, though they're not really fusion, since each is a basic entree from the nation it represents. Examples are Thai curry ($15/$18, depending on whether you want chicken, pork or beef/prawn or scallop) or Indonesian sambal ($15/$18). And yes, if you decide that all you really need are your old faves after all, General Tso's chicken or shrimp ($12/$18) is available, along with sweet and sour chicken or shrimp ($12/$18) and other tried-and-trues. \nSteamed items in the \"healthy\" category ($10-$15) run from mixed seasonal vegetables to shrimp with ginger and vegetables, all with a choice of sauces--spicy garlic, black bean, brown or white--so patrons can craft their own options.

John O'Boyle|For NJ Advance Media \nFor dessert, the red bean paste pancake ($6) is more like a thin, mild and mellow tart, playing well off the flavors of what precedes it. The winery sweet ball soup ($7) is indeed sweet, and may be a bit much as a wrap-up to the meal for anyone who already ordered several sweet items. \nOptions are many, prices are reasonable and portions are large, making for a good value. Service is efficient and pleasant, but guidance (if you ask for it) is quick and to the point. This is, after all, a busy place. \nKevin Lin, who also owns Szechuan-oriented Chengdu 23 in Wayne, opened this restaurant in September 2014. He noted many people who came to New Jersey from China didn't have a place where they could enjoy the type of cuisine they ate in their homeland, so he decided to provide that niche. \nNow they have found it, and others unfamiliar with Shanghai delights can also come to discover a different and more broad-based side to one of their favorite cuisines. \nIF YOU GO \nShanghai 46, 14 Route 46 East, Fairfield.
