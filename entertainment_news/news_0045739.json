She would love to say the [baby’s] name, but she couldn’t, partly because she’s angry that he would jeopardise her chances with Jade. \n\"But I think the biggest thing - though she doesn’t say this - is that beneath there is anger, as she should have said his name.” \nShabnam realises it wasn't Dean who told the social worker about Zaair \n“It’s such a complicated time, because their grief is still raw and everyone has their own way of dealing with it. \n“There’s no instruction book on how to deal with it, and what you’re seeing is people not quite connecting. But eventually you do see them resolve things, and she understands why he did it.” MORE 'EASTENDERS': QUIZ: How Many Of These Classic 'EastEnders' Baddies Can You Name? \nShabnam will then make the bold choice to go up against Dean and Shirley Carter, and Rakhee remains certain that she’s ready for the battle. \n“In her eyes, she’s absolutely ready because she’s fighting for her daughter, and I think she’s strongest and most motivated when she’s fighting for someone that she loves,” she tells HuffPost UK. “I know from stories I’ve read, and women that I’ve met, that there’s nothing more fierce or protective than a bereaved parent, so I think she’s absolutely ready for them.” \nShabnam’s stillbirth storyline had a huge impact on viewers and the soap’s team worked closely with the charity Sands to ensure scenes were handled appropriately and sensitively. \nShabnam and Kush's relationship has been under pressure following their loss \nSpeaking when the storyline was announced, Rakhee said: “In the UK, 3628 babies were stillborn in 2013, that’s one in every 216 births; a shocking fact I've come to learn during my preparation for telling this story. \n“It is an experience that profoundly changes a person's life forever, and we feel a heavy responsibility to tell the truth of this. Our hope is that we can encourage people to talk about their experiences and their babies that have died.” \nWatch ‘EastEnders’ from Monday 12 October to see the events unfold. \nIf you've been affected by the issues in this article, please contact Sands on 020 7436 5881. Close 'EastEnders': The Women Of Albert Square of Not a day goes by where we don't miss Pat and her wonderful, wonderful earrings. \"RI Y!\" Living legend Barbara Windsor has made numerous visits to Albert Square since officially leaving. She'll be back for live week, and fingers crossed there'll be a chance for the Queen Vic's most memorable landlady to yell that line again: \"Get outta ma pub!\" After years of bullying Angie, Den Watts finally met his match in Chrissie, who gave as good as she got. Until murdering him, obviously. Sadly, she coudn't plan a good enough getaway, and was stopped by police as she prepared to board a flight. Janine terrorised everyone from Billy Mitchell and Ian Beale, to Alice Branning, during her time in Walford. After inheriting millions, Janine became even more infuriatingly smug, but karma hit back and when she finally fell for Michael Moon, things didn't end well. She may be the newest of the bunch, but Kellie's character hasn't had it easy since moving into The Vic. While Linda has done her best to hold together the Carters, she's had a rough time, suffering a horrific assault at the hands of her brother-in-law, and acting as peacekeeper during the family's many feuds. Can she hold things together? Pauline was the original 'EastEnders' matriach, and there wasn't a problem she couldn't fix. Sadly, actress Wendy died in 2009, following a battle with breast cancer. Cora's dry sense of humour and witty putdowns manage to inspire giggles during even the most torturous scenes. As mother to Tanya and Rainie, she certainly has more than her fair shares of problems. Where would we be without Dot's wise words? The laundrette worker has been on hand to offer advice to anyone who needs it, since the show first aired in 1985. If she's good enough for ummm, Phil Mitchell, then she's good enough for us. Kat's the only Slater sister who's stuck around following the family's 2000 arrival. Jane is the longest-serving member of the cast, y'know. Bravo to Tracey for managing not to chip in during all those rows...  Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:33:38.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
