'Writing's On The Wall' had already topped the charts on iTunes earlier. The 23-year-old singer said that this was a special moment that he would never forget, adding it was such an honour to be asked to write and record the song. Smith also beat Adele's mighty 'Skyfall' and, as of now, the single has sold 70,000 copies since its release, which were 13,000 more than Justin Bieber 's 'What Do You Mean?' The 'Stay With Me' singer also announced that he was going to re-release his award-winning and chart-topping debut album 'In The Lonely Hour' as a new double-disc set.
