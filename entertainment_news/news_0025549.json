Women will read an article that convincingly persuades them to adopt an approach to diet and fitness as if it's the only way that works… and then the next article they read will completely contradict the last article they just read.\n\"There is so much conflicting information out there that it's overwhelming. Women get discouraged and just give up on trying to find good, effective, usable diet and fitness information on the Internet. We wanted to create simple, easy-to-follow diet and fitness advice that gets results and is based on real science that real women can use to reach their fitness goals,\" said Eric Charles .\nThat is where Dr. Jen comes in. Doctor Jennifer Lamoureux, Pharm D, is the newly added in-house expert who heads up the diet and fitness section on A New Mode. Jen's mission is to write on topics that women really care about and answer the questions women want to know with accurate, scientifically backed information.\nSome current topics Dr. Jen has written about include:\nHow to Boost Your Metabolism Should I Do a Sugar Detox? How to Get a Thigh Gap In addition to her impressive education credentials, Dr. Jen knows how to turn sophisticated scientific concepts into simple, inspiring messages that any woman can understand and use to immediately propel them to reaching their fitness goals (even if they're over 40!). This powerful combination of science, inspiration and easy-to-follow \"fitness hacks\" is Dr. Jen's approach to providing women with the fitness resource they've been searching for.\nABOUT DR. JEN\nHolding a pre-Med, bachelor's degree from Delta State University and a Doctorate from the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy in Boston , Dr. Jennifer Lamoureux was a highly respected Clinical Pharmacist at Tufts Medical Center. Most importantly, she understands how to provide women advice when it comes to diet and nutrition. Dr. Jen has a flair for explaining the science behind why certain diets and exercises work and putting it in a clear, easy to understand manner.\nABOUT A NEW MODE\nA New Mode is a premier women's lifestyle site founded by Sabrina Alexis and Eric Charles , dedicated to giving women no-nonsense, highly-effective advice that helps them achieve success in all aspects of life, from dating and relationships to health and fitness.\nA New Mode is more than a content site, it is a community where members can get the answers and support they need to be their best selves and have the life they have always wanted.
