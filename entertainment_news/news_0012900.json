Posted Oct. 16, 2015 at 4:04 PM Updated at 4:15 PM Posted Oct. 16, 2015 at 4:04 PM Updated at 4:15 PM Tryon Palace Historic Sites and Gardens officially has an executive director again. Lee Johnson, a self-employed lawyer, was named to fill the spot vacated by former Philippe Lafargue, who returned to his native France earlier in the year. LeRae Umfleet, who has served as interim director since February, will remain in her former position of deputy director. Johnson was presented to a select audience for the first time on Friday afternoon at the Palace’s History Center. He was presented by NC Department of Natural and Cultural Resources (NCDNCR) secretary Susan Kluttz. Also present for the announcement was NCDNCR deputy secretary Kevin Cherry, chief deputy secretary Karin Cochran, Palace assistant director Umfleet, Tryon Palace Commission Vice Chairman John Ward and Tryon Palace Foundation president Nelson McDaniel. who outlined his experience in law and legal representation, public affairs and government relations and media. Johnson has also served as legal counsel and chief of staff for two congressmen and as leadership chief of staff for two senators over his career. Kluttz emphasized her hope that Johnson will “greatly aid the Palace’s efforts in fundraising and public relations.” Johnson, wearing a black suit and a bright green tie, spoke briefly, stating that “I put forward my name for consideration because I believe in public service and believe in the importance of Tryon Palace.” He recalled a childhood visit to Tryon Palace and his realization that the Palace was an important place. More recently, he said, he has visited the Palace “just as a guest, a citizen,” when he had “a greater appreciation for what it meant.” He described the Palace “as crucial to our evolution and history of our country – not just our state, but our country… I view it as a privilege.” He said he has been personally impressed with Palace guides who took him through the grounds without knowing that he “had more than a passing interest,” and that he has seen letters and other communications from people expressing their respect for the site. Johnson also thanked Umfleet for her work in holding the reigns while a new director was sought. “With your support, and the other leaders of the state… I know that we’ll have a great future together,” he said. “I’ll do my very best to provide the leadership that’s appropriate to my role, and I’ll look to the leadership and the professionalism that” each of you bring to the Palace.
