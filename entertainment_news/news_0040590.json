Tropical Arts rehearsing for their upcoming production of Macbeth at the Tanks. Picture: Marc McCormack Source: News Limited \nA cackle of witches of more than three begins this Tropical Arts production of Macbeth with a re-imagining of Shakespeare’s dark play at Tanks Arts Centre. \nDirector Avril Duck says this year’s show (the eighth annual Shakespeare at the Tanks) is bigger and better than ever with more integration with the ARC Disability Services team and the deaf community, and bigger roles in the cast. \n“We have six actors from the deaf community this year and four interpreters,” Duck says. \nThe cast also has learned Auslan and the principals, Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, have shadow interpreters beside them to make the play more understandable to the deaf community. \nThe title role is played by Cairns Choral Society and Cairns Dinner Theatre performer James Mousa, who Duck describes as having a commanding presence. \n“There is presence in his stature but he also has a beautiful voice,” she says. \nVelvet Eldred, who as the ARC Disability Services co-ordinator, usually takes on smaller roles, will step into the limelight as Lady Macbeth. \n“She has a background as a shamanic and in counselling, so she has an awareness of the supernatural side of things,” Duck says. \nThe witches get a boost with more emphasis on their roles. \n“There are usually three witches, but we have three covens of witches, with 15 on stage at a time – it’s a rota of witches,” Duck says, and they not only speak, but sign and dance. \n“It’s not simply a story about one man and concentrating on the psychological torment of the character, but also how the community has brought this on him and how his actions affect so many people.” \nAdded is the work of Italian theatre designers Simone Teseriori and Simona Cosentini, well known in Cairns for their work at JUTE Theatre, as is designer of costumes, sets and props Darren Merchant, who delivers an armoury of swords and shields. \nYou can also call the play by its title as Duck says the cast decided not to hold to “the Scottish play” superstition. \nCHECK Tropical Arts’ Shakespeare at the Tanks – Macbeth is on tonight and October 29-31, with matinees on October 27-28 and 31. Auslan interpreted shows are on October 23, 28, 31 (evening show). visit ticketlink.com.au or call 1300 855 835.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:13:59.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
