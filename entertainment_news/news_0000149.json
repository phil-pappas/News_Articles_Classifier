U.S. Route 6 in Iowa takes two-lane motorists from Davenport on the Mississippi to Council Bluffs on the Missouri.\nDavenport, IA, September 21, 2015 --( PR.com )-- Emmy® nominated documentary filmmakers Kelly and Tammy Rundle of Fourth Wall Films will appear with their new documentary film \"River to River: Iowa's Forgotten Highway 6\" at venues along Historic Route 6 in Iowa. A Q&A with the filmmakers and film participants will follow the one-hour film presentation. A Humanities Iowa program will be presented at the Museum of Natural History in Iowa City on September 20 at 2pm and is free to the public. Showings in Marengo, Grinnell, Des Moines, Dexter and Council Bluffs, Iowa will follow.\n\"River to River: Iowa’s Forgotten Highway 6\" guides viewers on a nostalgic classic car journey through yesterday’s soda shops, filling stations, general stores, drive-ins, historic sites and roadside attractions that line Iowa’s U.S. Highway 6.\n\"Iowa's Historic Route 6 is our little romantic highway,\" said Dimitri Makedonsky, owner of the Ladora Bank Bistro in Ladora, Iowa off of Highway 6.\n\"With Interstate 80’s near universal use by travelers, Route 6 and the memories that define it have faded from the public’s consciousness,\" said director Kelly Rundle of Fourth Wall Films. \"The film is a celebration of a journey.\"\n\"Most travelers are unaware of the many colorful stories from the past around every turn in the road,\" said producer Tammy Rundle. \"Iowa’s portion of the transcontinental Route 6 has a past that includes Bonnie and Clyde, Jesse James, Nancy Drew, Jack Kerouac, the Great Race Across Iowa, and others.\"\nThe project was suggested to the Rundles by Dave Darby, Executive Director of the Iowa Division of the Route 6 Tourist Association.\n\"Historic U.S. 6 is the longest highway ever created in the United States,\" said Darby. \"It once stretched 3,652 miles from Provincetown, Massachusetts to Long Beach, California, right through the heart of Iowa.\" The Route 6 Tourist Association is responsible for an ongoing campaign to designate Historic Route 6 with special signs from Davenport to Council Bluffs.\nThe Rundles spent four years filming stories, people and places along Route 6 for the documentary project. Several Iowa City sites, including the Museum of Natural History, Plum Grove Historic Home are included in the film, as well as the surprising story of the mysterious author of the original Nancy Drew book series. Karen Mason, curator of the Iowa Women’s Archives, University of Iowa Libraries, and author Carolyn Dyer, sat for an on-camera interview to reveal the story of the popular mystery writer, Mildred Wirt Benson, who was born and raised in the hamlet of Ladora, Iowa off of Route 6.\nShe wrote her first published work at age 12 and was the first person to earn a Master's in Journalism at the University of Iowa.\nThe documentary premiered at the Putnam Giant Screen in Davenport, Iowa to a capacity crowd and continues with showings at venues along Highway 6. September 22 the film shows at 7pm at the Marengo Public Library in Marengo, IA; the 27th at 2pm at the Western Historic Trails Center in Council Bluffs; the 28th at 7pm at the Roundhouse in Dexter; on the 29th at 7pm at the Spaulding Center for Transportation in Grinnell. Screenings will continue at film festivals and in art theaters, followed by a national DVD release, and broadcasts on Midwestern PBS stations in 2016.\n\"River to River: Iowa’s Forgotten Highway 6\" was funded in part by grants from Humanities Iowa, Silos and Smokestacks National Heritage Area and the National Endowment for the Humanities through the documentary’s fiscal sponsor, The Iowa U.S. Route 6 Tourist Association.\nThe Rundles' Fourth Wall Films is an independent film and video production company. They produced the regional Emmy® nominated documentaries \"Letters Home to Hero Street\" (with WQPT-PBS) and \"Country School: One Room – One Nation\"; and the award-winning films \"Movie Star: The Secret Lives of Jean Seberg\" (co-produced with Garry McGee), \"Any Kid Anywhere: Sex Trafficking Survivor Stories\" (co-produced with Braking Traffik), \"Lost Nation: The Ioway 1, 2 & 3\", and \"Villisca: Living with a Mystery.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T06:26:34.099+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
