The Victorian Players take two familiar stories and add an extra helping of brains. \n“Zombeo and Juliet” revamps the most famous of Shakespearean works, making the “Montgomerys,” a family of zombies, face off against the “Decapitates,” a family of zombie hunters. Romeo, played by Stephan Kountz, is killed by Juliet’s (Brandi Hughes) cousin, but bounces back thanks to his family’s zombie legacy. When he makes plans to go to the mall with Juliet, a scuffle occurs, and he ends up banned for life. But more tragically, Juliet learns the truth about her new ZBF. With her hunter training almost complete, she must decide between love and family. \nIn the role of Michelle, Montgomery family friend, Marisa Keshock shined. With a lot of new faces, her experience and familiarity with the Vic stage played to her strength. Alongside Kountz, they had a natural rapport which aided the tempo of the show. \nZon Alec Green and Melissa Ramsey were two of the funniest cast members, playing mall security guards. The duo show off their comic talent with perfect costumes choices. \nAlso rocking some great costumes were Ameena Argow and an ensemble of perpetual zombies. \nHughes, another regular at the Vic, turned the classic fawn of a heroine and gave her some teeth. She’s certainly no damsel in distress as the heads begin to roll. \n“Downton Zombie” gives the PBS drama a boost of undead humor. As the Brampton household awaits the arrival of a new chambermaid, preparations are being made by the staff to host an important event. However, Miss Petunia, played by the precocious Argow, brings more than just domestic help to the manor. As she infects various members of the household, there seems to be only one way to escape, and Miss Sarah (Hughes) has the solution. \nKountz is consistently solid again as the butler, bringing a John Ritter-style of physical comedy to the production. He keeps the second act moving briskly as he tries to save everyone. \nArgow is impossible to ignore on stage. She shows much potential with only one play to her credit so far. \nTrudy Mason is a bolt from the blue as the Dowager Countess. Her tippling is fun and charming, causing her to be a bit rambunctious, but always classy. \nAnthony Zarconi was quite apt as the first of the household to turn zombie, and Hughes was again a delight as the love interest Miss Sarah. \nOverall, the show had a backyard production feel to it. The cast seemed underprepared at some points, but they made it through with smiles and laughs. For those seeking family-friendly silliness as their Halloween entertainment, the Vic will not disappoint. \n“Zombeo and Juliet” and “Downton Zombie” will run Friday and Saturday at 7:30 p.m. and Sundays at 2 p.m. until next Sunday.
