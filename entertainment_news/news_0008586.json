Utah Sen. Jim Dabakis has a hard time with the choreography as well. Dabakis is returning to Pioneer Theatre this week for the second concert staging of \"Rocky,\" reprising his role as The Criminologist, the show's no-neck narrator. \"You'll notice two or three times they put beautiful ladies on my lap, and it's usually before I'm supposed to go somewhere, so I do get special treatment,\" says the politician known for his say-anything flair. He declined to reveal the specifics of this year's \"foot costume change,\" but admitted the heels had to be special ordered for his size-14 foot. VIDEOS Check out all the Trib TopJobs Making a dramatic entrance as the \"Sweet Transvestite\" mad scientist Dr. Frank-N-Furter is Will Swenson, another Utah-reared talent. Swenson, a grandson of Ruth and Nathan Hale, is still remembered by Utah audiences for his performances in Mormon Cinema films such as 2002's \"The Singles Ward\" and 2004's \"Sons of Provo.\" On Broadway, he has just completed a stint playing Javert in the Broadway revival of \"Les Misérables.\" It was an amazing role and an amazing opportunity, Swenson says, \"but after a year and a half of jumping off the bridge every night, it became really challenging emotionally.\" When a movie part fell through recently, Swenson found himself \"beautifully unemployed,\" so he directed his agent to find him work in Utah so he could visit friends and family. Longtime theatergoers should remember the lauded performances of Swenson and his wife, Broadway musical superstar Audra McDonald, in \"110 in the Shade.\" The 2010 production was a fundraiser at Orem's Hale Center Theater, which is run by Swenson's brother Cody and his wife, Anne. \"Rocky,\" a tribute and sendup to B horror movies, tells of innocent young couple Brad (Eric Santagata) and Janet (Ashley Gardner Carlson), who become lost in the woods and meet Frank-N-Furter and his Tranyslvanian minions. The story was a 1973 British musical before it morphed into the cult classic 1975 film. Also returning to the Pioneer cast are Utah-based actors Carleton Bluford as Riff Raff, Ginger Bess as Magenta and Latoya Rhodes as Columbia. For Pioneer's concert staging, Swenson will draw upon his stint as a drag queen in the Broadway run of \"Priscilla: Queen of the Desert\" to help him embody the flamboyant Frank-N-Furter. He'll be helped by Pioneer wardrobe supervisor Aaron Swenson's eye-popping and witty costume designs, which serve as another character in the staging. In designing the \"Rocky\" costumes, Swenson (no relation to Will) drew upon his experiences as the vainglorious transsexual East German rocker Hedwig for Plan-B Theatre, a role he reprised three times. Swenson says Brad and Janet wear costumes that look 1950s square before they're confronted by the Transylvanians, who wear outfits visually inspired by the 1960s steampunk fashions of London's Carnaby Street. Performing as Hedwig affected his costume designs, as did his current rehearsals diving inside the character of Barbra Streisand for Pygmalion Productions' \"Buyer & Cellar,\" which opens Nov. 6. If nothing else, the designer can relate to the actors' pain in performing in high heels and skin-tight outfits. \"I'm always thinking about ways the costumes don't get in the way of performances, and then hopefully, every once in a while, push the story further, \" says Swenson. He designed a black-and-white-and-color-shocked palette, made edgier with extreme silhouettes. \"Because it's not 'Rocky' if you're not going right up to the edge,\" he says. \"When and where the color creeps in, I try to make that important.\" He advises audiences to watch for the show's most dramatic costume changes right before the second act's floor show. \"We basically have head-to-toe transformations on everybody,\" Swenson says. Another thing to watch for is who wears gold and who wears silver in the show.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T23:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:13:27.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
