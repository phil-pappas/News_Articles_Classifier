The Box Office: Pan opens in America on October 9th courtesy of Warner Bros./ Time Warner Inc. The film has debuted in Australia on September 24th, but it's going to need all the help it can get. The film was originally intended to open on July 24th before being moved to the current October date, allegedly because the extensive special effects needed more time. Produced by Berlanti Productions and RatPac-Dune Entertainment, this is Joe Wright's first major blockbuster after making the likes of Atonement , Hanna , and The Soloist . It is one of a number of would-be Peter Pan projects that were in development, and we'll see how many of the others end up happening on account of this film's commercial performance.I talk a lot about how we're going to start seeing would-be blockbusters opening in so-called \"offseason,\" and this is an accidental example. With a budget of $155 million, Pan is the most expensive movie ever to open in October. Sure, we all talk about big hits like Gravity and The Martian , but those films cost just over/under $100m to produce. Using the general 2.5x figure, Pan has to earn around $387m worldwide to basically break even. There are only two other October releases ever that have achieved that number ( Gravity and Puss N Boots ), although The Martian will probably get there, and the likes of Meet the Parents ($330m way back in 2000) probably soared over that figure when adjusted for inflation.Nonetheless, Pan is in a precarious position if being a long shot even in prime blockbuster territory, let alone a period when there are few mega-blockbusters to look to for hope. Couple that with negative reviews and tracking that puts the film at an under-$30 million debut, and Pan is in a pickle. Sure, Hugh Jackman is a star, but opening Prisoners to $20m on a $46m budget is different from opening Pan to $30m on a $155m budget. The rest of the case is either made up of unknowns (Levi Miller as the title character) or vaguely recognizable names (Rooney Mara, Amanda Seyfried, Garrett Hedlund) who aren't worth much in actual box office drawing power. I don't mean to be a doomsayer, but Pan is going to need the equivalent of every studio executive in the country clapping their hands and shouting \"I do believe in origin story prequels, I do, I do!\" to become anything resembling a hit. The Review: There are moments in Joe Wright's Pan that are filled with visual wonder and childlike panache. But it's a shame that these moments occur in a story of little consequence and little imagination. If the task was to craft a \"chosen one\" origin story for Peter Pan and make it as assembly-line as possible, then Jason Fuchs's paint-by-numbers screenplay is a roaring success. It plays like a straight-faced approximation of the \"you're special/you're the chosen one\" shtick that The LEGO Movie satirized while being filled mostly with characters who are either bland or outwardly obnoxious. It is a triumph of production design and special effects over story and character. In the 1980's and 1990's, that was the very definition of a bad movie. In terms of character investment and pathos, it makes Steven Spielberg's Hook look like The Fellowship of the Ring or at least P.J. Hogan's vastly underappreciated Peter Pan .Young Peter (Levi Miller) is an orphan living in a harsh London orphanage at the height of World War II. He quickly finds himself snatched up by a gang of fantastical pirates and whisked off to Neverland, where a chance encounter with the fearsome Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman, giving a real performance) reveals that Peter can actually fly. That's bad news for Blackbeard, as there is an ancient prophecy about a young boy born between human and fairy who can fly and will defeat the villainous pirate, so of course Peter must escape with the help of James Hook (Garrett Hedlund, in an aggravatingly arch performance). This opening act is surprisingly engaging, as the action-filled introduction features a few bits of interesting imagery (like a pirate ship flying through London and doing battle with World War II fighter planes) while Hugh Jackman's embittered villain keeps things oddly grounded. But once Pan and Hook escape and Blackbeard mostly fades from view, the film plunges faster than a bungee-corded pirate kidnapper.The focus is instead on Hedlund's shockingly miscalculated turn (he's basically bombing his auditions for Indiana Jones and Young Han Solo at the same time) and we are introduced to Tiger Lily (Rooney Mara) and her explicitly multicultural clan. Much has been made of Rooney Mara being cast as a technically Native American character, and frankly that's the least \"problematic\" thing about it. She's the prototypical \"strong female character\" that we see in movies today, introduced as a raging badass and yet continually undercut by the male heroes around her, either by requiring their rescue or being metaphorically swept off her feet by their half-assed flirtations. She does just enough fighting to put in the trailer but exists primarily as a would-be love interest for Hook. It's the kind of movie where being a \"strong female character\" means having no personality and having nothing interesting to say beyond exposition while occasionally doing a jump or swinging a sword before becoming imperiled again.As far as the other \"issue,\" well, it's great that Joe Wright envisioned the \"Pan council\" as a glorious melting pot of races and ethnicities, but that just highlights that A) it's headed up by one of the only white people in the tribe and B) they all require the heroics of two white men to save their village. Like Ridley Scott's Exodus , the casting of minority actors in various \"glorified extra\" roles only highlights the notion that the white people get all of the important parts. But that's all a second act issue, as the third act mostly comes down to Blackbeard, Pan, Hook, and Lily as they race to a particular destination and cross paths for a final showdown. The visuals in the climax are a little breathtaking, reminding one of those floating ice crystals from Titan A.E. but beautifully rendered in live-action.Again, when the focus is on action and adventure, the film is mostly engaging. I liked the first act captures and escapes, and the final battle works as visually dynamic action choreography even as we know we are being treated to a Star Wars rip-off. I'm partial to any film that has lots of swinging and jumping, and at times the film comes off like a $155 million version of that \" Pirate Dinner Adventure \" show that's located in Buena Park California. Hugh Jackman is actually terrific as the rather monstrous villain, which makes sense since he is a theater veteran and knows how to do this stuff. I liked some of the nastier details, like the fact that children actually die and that the film has people turn into multi-colored smoke balls when they get shot, which allows some brutal violence to exist in a PG-rated movie. I liked that Peter's orphanage is basically conducting a scheme, not unlike that monster of a judge who got caught basically selling kids to privatized juvenile detention facilities. The film is never really dull, and that first act is just good enough to convince you that everything might be okay after all.But the story is so formulaic, and what's worse it's unnecessary. We don't need to see how Peter became Peter Pan, especially in a story so heavily hinged on secrets regarding his parentage, since a big part of the Peter pan mythos is that he doesn't have a mother. Like all too many origin story prequels, it saves the story we actually might want to see for the \"probably never going to happen\" sequel. If you take the film as a Star Wars riff, and it's certainly closer to Star Wars than Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone , then you're left at the end with the fact that after helping to defeat Darth Vader, Han Solo is eventually going to turn on Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia and spend the rest of his days trying to kill his former friends. How does that happen? That's a story I wouldn't mind seeing, but instead they spent $155m on a Mad Libs \"chosen one\" arc which will probably bomb and thus negate the would-be franchise.As much as I liked some of the visuals, and some of the action beats, I must admit that in concept Pan is pretty much everything that's wrong with current blockbuster filmmaking, with the caveat that it's more entertaining than the likes of Terminator Genisys and that it will work pretty well for younger audiences (my daughter enjoyed it just fine). Miller makes a perfectly okay Peter Pan, but Hedlund (who is fine in his non-blockbuster work) is distracting as he comes off as someone doing an impression of someone doing an impression of Han Solo doing an impression of Indiana Jones. Mara is utterly wasted, and her substance-free, and utterly joyless character makes her lead in A Nightmare On Elm Street look like her Oscar-nominated turn in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo .The production design is scrumptious, and the special effects are a nice mix of practical stunt work and digital wizardry. But the characters are poorly conceived, and the whole thing feels like a \"let's take a classic story and turn it into a generic action blockbuster origin story\" thinking that is crippling blockbuster development. Say what you will about Hook , and I'm not one of its fiercest defenders by a long shot, but Spielberg's overstuffed Peter Pan sequel feels like a personal statement about his struggle to be a world-traveling filmmaker and a participatory parent while offering genuinely emotional and character-driven moments in its first and third acts. Joe Wright's Pan isn't trying to say anything at all beyond justifying the \"let's take an I.P. and turn it into a conventional big-budget action blockbuster\" mentality that fueled its existence. And that's not even bringing P.J. Hogan's awesome and soulful Peter Pan into the conversation.Like Ingrid Bergman as ( cruelly ) described by Alfred Hitchcock, Pan is so beautiful but so stupid. And in the end, the stupidity trumps the beauty and kills this beast dead.", "external_links": ["http://i61.tinypic.com/eq1etl.jpg", "http://piratesdinneradventureca.com/", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/event/article-3002550/Alfred-Hitchcock-overgrown-schoolboy-schoolboy-s-obsession-sex.html"], "published": "2015-10-05T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:30:17.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
