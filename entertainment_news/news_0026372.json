Leader of the pack: Violinist to helm conductorless group 1 / 2 Back to Gallery For all their apparent authority on the podium, orchestral conductors have always labored under a question mark.\nWhat, exactly, do they do? And are they really necessary?\nAs an implicit answer to these questions, small \"conductorless\" orchestras have been sprouting all over the country in recent years. The East Coast Chamber Orchestra is based in the New York area; Washington, D.C., has the Ars Nova Chamber Orchestra ; and Boston is home to a proudly conductorless orchestra called A Far Cry.\nNow Houston has Kinetic, an unconducted chamber orchestra set to make its debut Sunday at First Evangelical Lutheran Church .\nMore Information Kinetic\nWhen: 3 p.m. Sunday\nWhere: First Evangelical Lutheran Church, 1311 Holman\nTickets: Free; kineticensemble.org\nThe creator of this 16-piece string ensemble is violinist Natalie Lin , a New Zealander who arrived in Houston in 2007.\n\"Kinetic is completely conductorless,\" Lin, 26, says. \"I lead the ensemble with my violin. It's an exploration of chamber music on a larger scale.\"\nEven though the city already has several small orchestras, she thinks the time has come for one more.\n\"I really love Houston,\" Lin says. \"For such a big city, it's not as saturated by the arts as places like New York or London. I think there's room for growth, and that's one of the reasons why I wanted to start something here.\"\nHer fascination with musician-led orchestras goes back to her youth in Auckland, hearing the Australian Chamber Orchestra when the maestro-less ensemble was touring in New Zealand. She also played in self-directed orchestras during her high school years.\nMore recently, she's played in the Scottish Chamber Orchestra and other conductorless ensembles in Britain. And she's learned a thing or two about how they work.\n\"There are advantages and there are challenges,\" Lin explains. \"The challenge is that there isn't one person in charge. When you have one guy with a baton, everyone can stay together more easily. So it's more difficult without a conductor - but at the same time there's more freedom for exploring interpretation. And because there's no visual cue, everyone becomes more aware of watching and listening to everyone else.\"\nLin is completing a doctorate at Rice University . To fill her new orchestra, she looked to other young musicians she's come to know in Houston.\n\"Kinetic started as a project for my degree at Rice. I have a core group who serve as the principals in the orchestra - and all of them are my friends.\"\nFor Sunday's concert, Lin will feature the music of the early-20th-century English composer Ralph Vaughan Williams . She has selected three of his lush scores - \"Fantasia on a Theme of Thomas Tallis,\" \"Phantasy Quintet\" and \" Concerto Grosso for String Orchestra .\"\nHer decision was guided, in part, by the acoustics of First Lutheran.\n\"When I went to the church, I was attracted to its warm resonance. But I knew it wouldn't be a good place to play anything too intricate or complex. So the repertoire is a response to the warmth of the venue.\"\nCompleting the program will be a new work by composer Daniel Knaggs of Houston. The piece is called \"Two Columns at Sea,\" and it's based on a dream by St. Giovanni Bosco.\n\"I always enjoy Daniel's writing for strings,\" Lin says, \"because it's idiomatic and challenging. In this piece, there's a contrast between stillness and sections that are highly charged and energetic. He weaves between those two ideas.\"\nKinetic's three-concert series continues with performances Jan. 17 and May 8.\nLooking beyond her orchestra's first season, Lin says her goal is to build support for Kinetic by attracting a new, younger audience.\n\"My goal is to find a footing in the music scene here in Houston. And I think the format we have, with a conductorless ensemble, is something that will appeal to younger concertgoers.\"", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/61/8789071/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/61/8789071/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/61/8789070/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/61/8789070/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T19:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:45:53.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
