The same thing for women. \n\"That's why it's so difficult to be faithful in life.\" \nThe 51-year-old beauty enjoyed working with Daniel on the latest installment of the spy saga and found shooting sex scenes with him \"easy\". \nShe told the new issue of Britain's GQ magazine: \"What I like about Daniel is that it's so simple, he's a great actor, he's very beautiful. \n\"It was easy to do scenes that would be difficult to do with someone else, where you have to get intimate with someone you don't know, but with him it was easy.\" \nMonica also revealed she was previously asked to star in a Bond movie over 20 years ago but didn't feel \"ready\" at the time. \nShe said: \"A long time ago I did a screen test for James Bond, more than 20 years ago, But I was not ready. \n\"I don't remember the film. It was Pierce Brosnan I think - he was an amazing Bond, so sweet and so kind. Violent, but in a very nice way.\" celebrity", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T11:37:09.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
