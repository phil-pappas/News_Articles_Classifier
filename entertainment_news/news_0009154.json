Finished films, including the Kristen Wiig-led comedy “Masterminds” and “Kidnap,” starring Halle Berry, are still in limbo, although CEO Ryan Kavanaugh is mounting a plan to buy those businesses. \nRelativity, a mid-sized Hollywood studio behind films like “Immortals,” filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July owing $681 million to secured creditors.
