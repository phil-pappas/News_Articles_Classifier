The company's stock price also has dropped over the past two years.\nSeaWorld says negative media attention is partly to blame and there is also increased competition among Florida theme parks and other factors.\nAnimal rights activists fear SeaWorld will use the expanded tanks to breed orcas in San Diego and send them to other marine theme parks. They say captivity has cut the life spans of the highly intelligent animals that should be transferred to ocean sanctuaries on the coast.\nSeaWorld says its animals have normal breeding interactions in the healthy environment provided by the park, and not allowing its killer whales to breed would be inhumane.\nSeaWorld helps the plight of orcas, which were hated and feared before SeaWorld began opening its parks, spokesman David Koontz said in an email to The Associated Press.\n\"Nearly a half-billion guests to all our SeaWorld parks, and other marine parks around the world, have gotten the chance to experience killer whales firsthand, learn about them and come to appreciate them for the wonderful animals they truly are,\" Koontz said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:04:30.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
