It was one of the best moments of my life.\n\"My husband (Abdul) tried to get me to apply two years ago and I said, 'look, I don't have the confidence to do something like this', and this year he pretty much forced me and said, 'you're really good, you're really clever, you should just do it, what's the worst that will happen?'.\n\"Those were famous last words. And I did it, and I went in and I applied and every stage of the process felt unlikely and like it wasn't meant to happen.\n\"My confidence grew and then this happened.\"\nShe added that she had \"no idea my face could do that\" and hopes her baking will be the lasting impression on viewers - and not her eyebrows.\nThe mother-of-three described how she \"comes from a culture where there is no such concept of dessert after dinner\" and she caught the bug for baking during home economics.\nBorn in Luton to a Bangladeshi family, Nadiya has been praised as a role model for young British Muslims after previously admitting she was nervous that audiences would \"look at me, a Muslim in a headscarf, and wonder if I could bake\".\nPromoted stories The Muslim Association of Britain said of her win: \"Her participating in The Great British Bake Off has demonstrated the connection that young British Muslims have with British society.\nShare article \"The hijab that she wears has not deterred her from participating and winning the show. This demonstrates how Muslims have made great efforts in integrating into society; and how they are achieving that in many various aspects.\"\nFor her final challenge she created the wedding cake she missed out on at her own wedding in Bangladesh, which she decorated in a red, white and blue sari, the colours of the Union Jack.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-08T16:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:12:28.991+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
