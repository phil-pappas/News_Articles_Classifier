Good Morning Britain is a great show with a terrific team on and off screen. I’m looking forward to it enormously.” . @piersmorgan officially joins GMB! Piers will co-host with @susannareid100 3 days a week: http://t.co/a7J1z7SGJV pic.twitter.com/27XnglIAcK \n— Good Morning Britain (@GMB) October 13, 2015 \nThe 50-year-old currently presents Piers Morgan’s Life Stories on ITV. Between 2011 and 2014 he presented Piers Morgan Live on CNN in America. \nPiers will step into the shoes of Ben Shephard, who has co-hosted the show on weekday mornings with Susanna since April 2014. \nThis will not be Piers’s first time on Good Morning Britain: in April 2015 he filled in for a week as a guest presenter when Ben was on holiday. He co-hosted with Susanna Monday to Thursday and with Kate Garraway on the Friday. Promoted stories The Good Morning Britain team (Ian West/PA) \nAfter his guest appearance, Piers was criticised by Ofcom for laughing as an interviewee repeatedly used the F-word live on air. \nOfcom decided not to take action against the programme as the hosts had quickly apologised, but said it was “concerned” that he had laughed during an expletive-filled video-link interview with daredevil climber Alain Robert. \nSusanna immediately said: “Slightly more frank language at this time in the morning than we’re normally used to on Good Morning Britain so apologies for that,” while Piers added: “We are going to try and recover from your choice use of language, which is a little alarming for us at this time in the morning.” \nOfcom received complaints about the incident, and said: “In this case, the word ‘f***ing’ was broadcast twice before the watershed. There was therefore a clear breach.” Piers Morgan (Rob Latour/Invision) \nHe was also due to appear in July, but was dropped from the scheduled appearance because he was in an advert for the National Lottery. As GMB is classified as a news and current affairs programme, presenters are prohibited from appearing in paid ad campaigns. \nPiers began his career in journalism as a writer and editor for tabloids including The Sun, News of the World and the Daily Mirror. In 1994, aged 29, he was appointed editor of the News of the World by Rupert Murdoch. He then edited the Daily Mirror from 1995 until 2004. \nHe has also been a judge on America’s Got Talent and appeared in the US celebrity version of The Apprentice in 2008. The outspoken presenter attracted controversy in the United States after calling for stricter gun laws. \nFollowing today’s announcement he tweeted: BREAKING NEWS: It's official – I am joining @GMB as co-host with @susannareid100 from November.
