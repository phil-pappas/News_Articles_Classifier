TicketProcess.com is happy to announce that they currently have a large and affordable selection of New York Mets vs Kansas City Royals Tickets available online now or charge by phone toll free.\n(PRWEB) October 24, 2015\nThe stars of this year's postseason have shined very bright, led by New York Mets second baseman Daniel Murphy. The 30-year-old, seven-year-veteran hit 14 home runs in exactly 499 at-bats this season. He has gone deep seven times in 38 at-bats this postseason, including at least one dinger in each of the last six games, which is an all-time MLB postseason record.\nStatisticians may be interested to know that if Murphy homered at his amazing postseason rate throughout the course of his 499 regular season at-bats, he would've ended the year with 184 long balls.\nAs much as the historic power display has been an enthralling source of joy for Mets fans in New York City and beyond, the plain truth is their pitching staff will need to continue to impress in order to propel them through this final series and into the rare air of a World Series winner.\nA quartet of young arms led by Jacob deGrom and Matt Harvey are complemented by a collection of other 20-something hurlers who will definitely be ready and well rested by the time the series begins on American League soil thanks to their 6-3 victory in the 2015 All Star Game.\nThe chance to see a World Series game live is something that many Mets fans have waited for for nearly 30 years.
