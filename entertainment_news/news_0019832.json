Mystery surrounds the woman as he nurtures her back to health.\nThe ritual that was meant to slay her in sacrifice appears to be the work of Mordanado, a Greycloak mage who had stripped him of his arts long ago. Now the reclusive Pacolorius, known only as Padison the glazer, must reclaim his most potent skill, the magic of dreams, to defeat the Greycloak before she is sacrificed again.\nScherzinger describes the process of this third book, \"The inspiration for 'The Wizard of Grimmer's Wharf' comes from many sources. There are people I know that evoke such character that they make me want to include them, giving them new life in the written word. This story grew from a basic plot I had devised and as before, the story took a life of its own. The tale is an evolution of characters and ideas. I mainly wanted also to explore the nature of dreams. I started with a premise and let the story write itself. I didn't know the true end of the tale when I started any more than a reader would.\"\n'The Wizard of Grimmer's Wharf' is published in eBook format by eBookIt.com and is now available at popular online retailers.
