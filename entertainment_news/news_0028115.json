And while we're not usually ones to endorse emulating A-Listers, we've decided to take a leaf out of these celebrities' respective books and use them for 'Pinkspiration' this Breast Cancer Awareness month. Just by donning something pink, you could help raise awareness and save lives in the process. Sounds simple, but it's true.\nIf you're of the male persuasion and looking for inspiration, look no further than our very own dashing Jamie Dornan, who was seen sporting a ravishing pair of pink shorts only a few weeks back...\nPink shorts aren't just for Ronaldo, you know...\nWho allowed you to walk out in bright pink shorts AND a wife-beater-like tank, Cristiano Ronaldo? pic.twitter.com/NYD5dIBtOD\n— Hungry Hungry Heels (@hungryheels) June 18, 2013\nWhile there's no denying that it's getting a bit nippy for shorts, but you could always sport a pair of pink woolly socks, or follow Real Madrid's lead and don a pink football jersey.\nL #Ronaldo Real #Madrid pink #Jersey #CristianoRonaldo long sleeve FIFA Champions…… http://t.co/TotRMR4fUT pic.twitter.com/vmXzo7Hv7O\n— C.
