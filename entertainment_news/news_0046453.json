Anderson premiered his first documentary, “Junun,” on Thursday, Oct. 8, 2015, at the New York Film Festival, unveiling a sonically rich portrait of Indian musicians and Radiohead’s Johnny Greenwood recording in Rajasthan. The film, just under an hour in length, plunges into their recording sessions, along with Israeli composer Shye Ben Tzur, during a three-week trip to the North-Western Indian state.
