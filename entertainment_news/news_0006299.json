Scott Flanders, pictured, CEO of Playboy Enterprises, told the New York Times sex acts are now \"one click away.\" (Ricardo DeAratanha / Los Angeles Times) Associated Press \nPlayboy will no longer publish photos of nude women as part of a redesign of the decades-old magazine, according to a news report Monday. \nExecutives for the magazine company told The New York Times that the change will take place in March 2016. \nThe paper reported that the print edition of Playboy will still feature women in provocative poses, but they will no longer be fully nude. \nPlayboy editor Cory Jones contacted founder and current editor in chief Hugh Hefner recently about dropping nude photos from the print edition and he agreed, the New York Times reported. \nThe change represents a major shift for the magazine, which broke new ground when Hefner created it and featured Marilyn Monroe on its debut cover in 1953. \nBut officials acknowledge that Playboy has been witnessing widespread changes. \"You're now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free. And so it's just passÃ© at this juncture,\" said Scott Flanders, the company's chief executive.

But this time, as the magazine seeks to compete with younger outlets, Flanders said it sought to answer a key question: \"If you take nudity out, what's left?\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T11:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:42:43.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
