She was in a suburban shopping mall, and strangers, one after another, kept approaching her asking if Tan was guilty or innocent of killing his father.\n\"They kept coming up to me,\" said the juror, who agreed to be interviewed outside the courtroom after the mistrial had been declared on condition that her name not be published.\n\"I kept saying, 'I don't know! I don't know!'\" she said. \"Then I was suddenly in the courtroom and everyone there was asking me, 'Is he guilty or not guilty?'\"\nWhat that juror experienced is known as \"jury stress,\" and is typical of jurors who have deliberated troubling crimes.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nQ&A: What you're probably asking about the Tan trial\nStudies have shown jurors to exhibit psychological and physical symptoms, including insomnia, anxiety, stomachaches and depression, even after the conclusion of their trials.\nSymptoms are often more pronounced in cases that feature graphic or violent evidence, as the Tan case did.\n\"It's absolutely a real thing,\" said Sonia Chopra, a senior consultant at the National Jury Project in Oakland, California, who has studied jury stress.\nMore than two-thirds of jurors report feeling some stress as a result of jury duty , according to the National Center for State Courts, and Chopra has found in her own research that 11 percent of jurors exhibit symptoms consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder.\nChopra said jury stress is more common in court cases that are longer in duration, high-profile and end in mistrials.\nBy those standards, the Tan trial hit the jury stress trifecta. The case was a local social media sensation from the outset, the deliberations lasted longer than the oral arguments, and the case ended in a mistrial.\n\"Being on a hung jury is incredibly frustrating,\" Chopra said. \"You spend the time, you go through all these symptoms, and you're not able to come to a resolution and get on with it.\"\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nSome jurors 'shocked' at end of deliberations\nThree jurors in the Charles Tan case speak out after a mistrial was declared on Oct. 8. Video by Jamie Germano\nChelsea Bloom, 24, a juror on the Tan trial who said she voted in favor of acquittal, anticipated Thursday after a mistrial was declared that she would get a decent night's sleep for the first time since the trial began.\n\"You just lay there at night, turning things over and over in your mind,\" Bloom said.\nSome Tan jurors said it wasn't just the evidence that left them struggling, but also the severity of the punishment of the second-degree murder charge facing Tan, which carries a 25 years-to-life sentence.\nMindful of the toll that trials can take on jurors, federal courts in 2005 began extending mental health benefits in the form of counseling and \"critical incident debriefing\" services to jurors serving in high-stress federal trials.\nState courts in a handful of states are experimenting with similar services. The Superior Court of Arizona, for instance, provides all jurors with a pamphlet offering \"coping techniques.\" The advice includes bullet points like: \"You don't have to prove yourself to anyone\" and \"Resist negative thoughts about the verdict.\"\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nAndreatta: Tan trial jurors not to blame\nAfter declaring a mistrial, Monroe County Court Judge James Piampiano addressed jurors privately in the courtroom. Through the windows, Piampiano and jurors could be seen laughing at times.\nBloom said the interaction, which lasted about 15 minutes, was reassuring.\n\"He told us not to feel bad,\" she said.\nIn an interview later in the day, Piampiano said he wanted jurors to know that they might be criticized for their performance, but that they should be proud.\n\"This is a jury that worked very hard,\" Piampiano said. \"This is a jury that followed all the rules and admonitions of the court, did not engage in any juror misconduct, who came to work every day on time and were prepared to do that work.\n\"They deliberated between 52 and 54 hours,\" he continued. \"That's almost unheard of in the Hall of Justice.\"\nDANDREATTA@Gannett.com\nIncludes reporting by staff writer Gary Craig.\nVIDEOS: THE CHARLES TAN MURDER CASE Charlie Tan walks out of court after mistrial | 02:43 Attorneys and jurors in the Charles Tan murder case comment on the mistrial.
