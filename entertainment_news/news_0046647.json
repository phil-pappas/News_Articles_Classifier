By Jason Victor Serinus Special to The Seattle Times \n“The River” resides somewhere beyond the intersection of ceremony and show biz, at a place where multicultural collaboration becomes sacred art. The work, whose world premiere takes place Thursday, Oct. 8, as part of the UW World Series, springs from a desire by the members of hip New York new music string quartet Ethel and New Mexican Native American flutist Robert Mirabal to achieve better communication between people of different cultures and worlds. \nWhile the official description of the work as a cross-cultural exploration of water as the embodiment of spirit and its essential role in life on Earth may sound pretty heady or ephemeral, depending upon your point of view, a chat with Ethel cellist Dorothy Lawson and the multifaceted Mirabal reveals two extremely committed artists who are deeply aware of the challenges human beings face at this critical time in history. \nMirabal promises, on the simplest level, beautiful collaborative music that is both profound and joyful. Lawson, in turn, notes that the show has loads of dancing and singing “with a consideration of the spiritual experience that our social setting doesn’t encourage.” CONCERT PREVIEW Ethel and Robert Mirabal \n8 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 8, Meany Hall, University of Washington, Seattle; $35-$40 (206-543-4880 or uwworldseries.org ). \nMirabal insists that the form he and Ethel have created springs from a commitment to both his ancestry and the modern world. “Not to sound New Agey or any of that, I’ve always considered my music, which comes from a 1,000-year-old culture, as a form of ceremony,” Mirabal said.
