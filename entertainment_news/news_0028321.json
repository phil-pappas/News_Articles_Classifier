Jamie Reed MP (Richard Maude/PA) \nThe politician was the first MP to stand down in the wake of Corbyn’s landslide victory in Labour’s leadership contest. He tweeted his resignation within minutes of the result. \n“My immediate thoughts were about my constituency: nothing is more important to me in politics than fighting for the interests of Copeland. I imagine this would be hard to do in the Australian jungle,” MP Reed wrote in his article. Congratulations to Jeremy Corbyn.

Copeland is set to become one of the fastest-growing parts of the UK economy, there’s a lot of work to be done and if you really want to see me in late November and early December, I’ll be holding my usual surgeries – but please remember, planning issues are a matter for the council.” Promoted stories \nMeanwhile, Geordie duo Ant and Dec donned fake beards and tatty wigs for the new I’m A Celebrity trailer released by ITV. \nIn the teaser, the presenters are depicted as grubby jungle castaways who look as if they need a bath. \n“We’ve been stranded here for months. Just the two of us, spending every second of the day together,” Dec says. \n“Nothing new there, then!” Ant responds. \n“And I absolutely stink!” Dec continues. “It’s no picnic having to wash your unmentionables in a smelly old creek every day, I can tell you.” What's that @antanddec ? A special message coming soon? #ImACeleb pic.twitter.com/EwF0WEmkyy \nAnt disappears into some bush, which is revealed to be a red telephone box shower: “Pass me a towel, will you? Me didgeridoos are getting cold,” he says. \nAn exasperated Dec replies: “I’ll didgeridoo you in a minute!” \nThe presenters will once again helm ITV’s popular reality jungle series, but the line-up of stars is unconfirmed. Anne Robinson presented Watchdog for 15 years (BBC) \nHowever, former Watchdog and Weakest Link presenter Anne Robinson is among those rumoured to be heading out to Australia. \nThe 71-year-old told the Radio Times: “I think the last offer from I’m A Celebrity was about half a million.” \nThe show usually features an American star or two, and one of the biggest names reported as a possible contestant is Caitlyn Jenner. Caitlyn Jenner gives a speech (Paul A. Hebert/Invision/PA) \nThe Olympian’s name is being attached to just about every reality and talent TV series on both sides of the Atlantic. \nAs a prominent campaigner for transgender rights, she would be a huge signing. Caitlyn’s show I Am Cait, broadcast by the E! network, has just been renewed for a second season. \nFormer N-Dubz singer Tulisa Contostavlos is reported as another possibility for the jungle. \nThe former judge of The X Factor was cleared of trying to arrange a drug deal in 2014 when the case against her collapsed. Tulisa Contostavlos (Dominic Lipinski/PA) \nWeeks later, she made a comeback on the ITV singing series as a guest judge. The pop star’s BBC Three documentary Tulisa: The Price of Fame also aired in 2014. \nAn appearance on I’m A Celebrity would boost the profile of any star as the episodes regularly air to an average of nine million viewers.
