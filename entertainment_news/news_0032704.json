PLL returns Jan. 12, but until then, here's all the information you can learn in those four minutes. Minor spoilers ahead!\n1. Alison is a teacher. This was revealed at the end of the summer finale, but this time you really get to see her in action.\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail ABC Family 2. Some kind of hearing is happening in four days. Alison's happy about it, but wishes she had a little more time to prepare and convince the other girls to help her out. \"The court can compel your friends to come but they may not be sympathetic to the cause,\" her new pal Dr. Owens says. Yeah, they may not be! Good looking out, Dr. Owens.\n3. Spencer is working in Washington, D.C. This can only lead to a crossover episode with Scandal .\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail ABC Family More From Cosmopolitan 4. Aria is promoting a book called A Majority of None . At first it looks like she wrote this book, but you can see her get up and cede the table to a professorial-looking gentleman who seems to be the real author. Maybe she's a publicist or assistant of some kind.\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail ABC Family 5. Ezra has written a book called Ostinato . The author bio on the back indicates that he still lives in Rosewood and runs The Brew, where he likes to \"concoct his own juice blend.\" Of course he does.\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail ABC Family 6. Hanna's rich and important enough to be riding in first class. But that toddler is a fake-out! It just belongs to some lady who had to go to the bathroom mid-flight.\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail ABC Family 7. Emily is working as a bartender, probably on the coast. The second part of that assertion is based on the \"California Republic\" and \"Surf Point\" signs behind her head, so it's entirely possible this is a theme bar in a landlocked town. For Emily's sake, though, hope that it's authentic. Nothing's worse than a seafood restaurant in a place with no visible body of water.\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail ABC Family 8. The girls are still skeptical of Alison. None of them seem to be responding well to her handwritten plea for assistance. Can you blame them? The girl faked her own death and called Hanna fat. Compel away, court!\n​Follow Eliza on Twitter .", "external_links": ["http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/480x295/gallery-1444416853-aria.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/640x454/gallery-1444416698-ali.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/980x668/gallery-1444416745-spencer.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1600x1136/gallery-1444416698-ali.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/480x332/gallery-1444416446-hannah.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1280x877/gallery-1444416780-emily.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/980x679/gallery-1444416446-hannah.jpg", "http://www.buzzfeed.com/jarettwieselman/watch-the-first-four-minutes-from-the-pretty-little-liars-se", "http://www.twitter.com/thompsonplaid", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1600x1097/gallery-1444416780-emily.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/640x393/gallery-1444416853-aria.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/640x436/gallery-1444416745-spencer.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/640x443/gallery-1444416446-hannah.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1600x1090/gallery-1444416745-spencer.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/480x329/gallery-1444416780-emily.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/768x532/gallery-1444416446-hannah.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1600x984/gallery-1444416853-aria.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1280x787/gallery-1444416853-aria.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/768x523/gallery-1444416745-spencer.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/480x340/gallery-1444416698-ali.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/640x318/gallery-1444416992-ezra.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/768x382/gallery-1444416992-ezra.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1600x1108/gallery-1444416446-hannah.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1600x800/landscape-1444416780-emily.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1600x800/landscape-1444416446-hannah.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1280x637/gallery-1444416992-ezra.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/640x438/gallery-1444416780-emily.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1600x800/landscape-1444416698-ali.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1280x909/gallery-1444416698-ali.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1600x800/landscape-1444416853-aria.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/980x487/gallery-1444416992-ezra.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/768x545/gallery-1444416698-ali.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/980x696/gallery-1444416698-ali.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1600x796/gallery-1444416992-ezra.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1600x800/landscape-1444416992-ezra.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/480x327/gallery-1444416745-spencer.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/768x472/gallery-1444416853-aria.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1280x887/gallery-1444416446-hannah.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/980x602/gallery-1444416853-aria.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/480x238/gallery-1444416992-ezra.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/980x672/gallery-1444416780-emily.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1280x872/gallery-1444416745-spencer.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/768x526/gallery-1444416780-emily.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1600x800/landscape-1444416745-spencer.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T23:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:43:15.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
