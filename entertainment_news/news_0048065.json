Several campaign committees under Bruno’s control will be closed. They have a total of about $1.5 million.\nSome money will go to local groups, including $100,000 for a scholarship fund through the Tech Valley High School Foundation in Albany, Bruno said in a news release.\n“It’s time for me to focus on what’s most important in my life right now and that’s spending time with family and loved ones, doing some traveling and generally enjoying all that life has to offer,” said Bruno, R-Brunswick, Rensselaer County, the powerful Senate majority leader from 1994 through 2008.\nOn Christmas Eve last year , the state Attorney General’s Office said it approved a $2.4 million reimbursement in legal fees for Bruno, who was found not guilty in a corruption trial in May 2014.\nBruno said the majority of what’s left will go to Senate Republicans’ campaigns as they try to maintain the majority in next year’s elections, when all 63 seats will be on the ballot. Republicans hold a slim one-seat majority, and there will be key races in the Hudson Valley and the Rochester area.\n“As Republican leader, it was my job to return Republicans to the majority every two years to assure there was balance in a government dominated by Democrats,” Bruno said. “I strongly believe that preserving that balance and maintaining a Republican Majority is more important than ever.”\nJSPECTOR@Gannett.com\nwww.twitter.com/gannettalbany", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:04:25.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
