Magazine. The magazine claimed the singer-turned-fashion designer was occasionally drunk when she had to do interviews. OK! noted that Jessica frequently gave interviews \"three sheets to the wind.\" The publication also quoted a so-called \"insider\" as saying, \"Jessica showed up for an interview with a major fashion magazine and couldn't answer a single question straight.\" The supposed \"insider\" also mentioned Jessica's antics during the interview, \"She giggled her way through the entire thing and clearly wasn't in the right state of mind.\" The insider then added, \"Jessica loves to drink, and she's not afraid to mix business with pleasure.\" However, the publication didn't give details about when the actress of \" The Dukes of Hazzard \" had the interview with the \"major fashion magazine.\" Besides, it didn't mention with which \"major fashion magazine\" Jessica had the interview. Responding to the report, a source close to Jessica told Gossip Cop that the story published by OK! was \"not true at all.\" The magazine apparently created its story based on Jessica's bizarre appearance on Home Shopping Network last month. Though many people accused the fashion designer of being drunk during the show, Bill Brand, the president of HSN, defended her as saying, \"Of course she wasn't drunk,\" and called her a \"top-notch professional.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T04:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:58:56.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
