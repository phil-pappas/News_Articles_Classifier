Oh, that's funny!\"\n30 Photos Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson A close look at the wrester-turned-actor and star of \"Hercules\" \"Fast & Furious\" and more\nNow, it's time to meet the princess at the heart of the movie: Moana, who enlists help from a demi-god named Maui (Johnson) -- as well as a sidekick pig, Pua, and cranky chicken, Hei Hei -- to prove herself a master wayfinder.\nWatch: This is the real reason why Disney characters rarely have moms On Wednesday, Disney announced that Auli'i Cravalho, a 14-year-old Hawaiian native, will voice Moana. And the video of Cravalho finding out she got the part is guaranteed to pull at a few heartstrings too.\n\"When I first heard that there was going to be an audition to potentially play the role of Moana, I thought, 'No way that could be me,'\" she recalls. In fact, she didn't audition -- a Oahu casting agent discovered her singing at a charity competition.\nFor his part, Johnson has signed off on the casting:\nIT'S OFFICIAL: After months and months of worldwide casting calls, we've finally found our next DISNEY Princess... #MOANA. I'm pumped to welcome 14yr old @AuliiCravalho of Mililani, Hawaii to our project. What's amazing about this story is that she didn't think she was good enough so she never auditioned. Fortunately, one of our Oahu casting agents discovered her singing at a charity competition and the rest is history. * An awesome lesson to all young kids out there... work hard, have confidence in yourselves and never think you're not good enough because you never know what the future holds. Congratulations Auli'i! Can't wait to work with you and watch you bring this new Disney Princess to life. #YesThatsMeOnTheRight #HisNameIsMaui #HesADemiGod #AndHePutsMoanaInHerPlace #SoHeThinks #DisneyAnimation #MOANA #TimeToSing\nA photo posted by therock (@therock) on Oct 7, 2015 at 7:42am PDT\n\"An awesome lesson to all young kids out there,\" he writes. \"Work hard, have confidence in yourselves and never think you're not good enough because you never know what the future holds.\"\n\"Moana\" hits theaters on Nov. 23, 2016.", "external_links": ["http://www.etonline.com/news/170017_d23_pixar_and_walt_disney_animation_panel/", "https://instagram.com/p/8ikVUqIh7-/", "http://www.etonline.com/movies/151052_this_is_why_disney_characters_rarely_have_moms/", "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/19/3de7211f-f8fa-4a0b-bdbc-c1a8d771535e/thumbnail/220x140/87ac61e295d274e7a450054f2816558e/450856056.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T01:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:00:34.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
