My distinctive style – my hair in particular. I wouldn’t compare myself to any of the other girls, none of us are like each other. I also think I bring a lot of honesty to my performances. Which one artist in the industry most inspires you and why? I have two – Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston. Nobody danced like Michael before he was around. Neither he nor Whitney can be compared to anyone else. Nobody touches them – not even Beyonce. For me they are so distinctive in style and personality. \nLauren Murray \nAge: 26 years old, from North London Occupation: Until recently, she worked as a dental receptionist In her first audition: Lauren performed Jocelyn Brown’s Somebody Else’s Guy Of the remaining acts in the competition, whose album would you buy? I loved Jennifer’s first audition, I’m in love with her! She’s wicked, very different with a young vibe – so I’ll say her. Describe your mentor in three words? Genuine, edgy and stylish. \nLouisa Johnson \nAge: 17 years old, from Essex Occupation: Currently a student In her first audition: Louisa performed Michael Jackson’s Who’s Loving You What makes you stand out from everyone else in your category? I think I’ve got age on my side a bit, and for my age I’m not really like other people – my voice is more mature. I’m a rounded performer, which I hope I can show more if I get to live shows. Where do you see yourself in five years time? I want to be doing worldwide tours and my main goal is to have Beyonce’s phone number in my phone book. I want to be known around the world for a good reason. \nMonica Michael", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T02:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:32:45.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
