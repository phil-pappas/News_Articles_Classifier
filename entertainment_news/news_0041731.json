(Photo: Comedy Central) \nYou won’t have Joe Biden to kick around anymore, late night TV. \nWith Wednesday afternoon’s announcement that Vice President Biden will not run for president, one of the favorite political targets of nighttime talk show hosts is about to leave them. \nSo by the time Wednesday night came around, late night hosts couldn’t help but take a few final cracks at good ol’ Delaware Joe. \n“The Daily Show with Trevor Noah” opened with a montage of cable news clips of hosts breathlessly speculating about Biden’s decision just before he walked into the Rose Garden at The White House. \nThe clips ended with a reporter saying, “Democrats are sort of biting their nails and many of them are on edge.” \n“They are biting their nails. They are on edge. It sounds like they are coming off a drug trip,” Noah joked. “[They are like], ‘C’mon man, you got some of that Biden, man? I need some of that Delaware white. I’ll suck your district, man.” \nPresident Barack Obama watches as Vice President Joe Biden turns to his wife after announcing that he will not run for the presidential nomination. (Photo: Jacquelyn Martin/AP) \nOf all the late night hosts who joked about Biden’s announcement, Noah had the harshest burn, focusing on Biden’s comment that “we’re out of time necessary to mount a winning campaign for the nomination.” \nNoah’s response? \n“Oh. You wanted to run a winning presidential campaign? I thought you were just going to do your usual thing,” he said before showing images from Biden’s failed campaigns in 1988 and 2008. \nToo soon? Some in the audience thought so, letting out groans that eventually turned into laughs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:14:41.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
