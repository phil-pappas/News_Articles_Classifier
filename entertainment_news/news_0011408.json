The city had sought to downplay the geographic significance of the move by focusing on a call for nominations for this year's fortunate (or maybe not so fortunate) woodsy plant. But traditionalists, ever eager for the first counterattack in the annual war on Christmas, still took to the comments section, decrying the tree's unexpected voyage east, leaving both the Picasso sculpture and the Christkindlmarket to hold down the seasonal fort on the cold concrete of Daley Plaza, now sans towering Tannenbaum.\nMore practical minds, outside those selling bratwurst or working for Macy's, appreciated the wisdom of the move: There is far more space to breathe in the cold in Millennium Park; it is easier, and a little cheaper, to park a car and head to the tree for some festive familial frolic; the tree will now stand guard over the ice-skating rink in that cultural park, offering some selfie-worthy competition for Rockefeller Plaza in New York. The tree will have a verdant backdrop. Carolers won't be so scrunched.\nThe beloved and triumphant Cloud Gate sculpture now will reflect and refract the tree's festive lights — this was one way to surreptitiously dress up \"The Bean\" for the holidays without looking tacky or annoying its creator, Anish Kapoor. Especially given the perennial construction season that constricts the breadth of Washington Street in downtown Chicago, there long has been little room to stroll to the tree, let along drive a creaking vehicle filled with open-mouthed kids anywhere near its branches. Stop for even a second, and you risked a ticket from those oblivious to the season of goodwill. The nativity scene and the Menorah — both the province of private entities — likely will remain in Daley Plaza. And the market, with its need for butane and power lines, will stay, although you know it would love to hitch its Wiener schnitzel to the branches of the arboreal escapee.\nBut you can rest assured that the tree, and its admirers, will not be coming back.\nOf course, many Chicagoans couldn't care less about the location of the tree. Understandably. There are more important issues that have beset us. But cultural symbols are important, and this move surely is emblematic of a great shift, an unstoppable momentum, in the spiritual center of the city. Christmas is moving away from the Daley Loop and toward Michigan Avenue, downplaying the limestone canyons of commerce and foregrounding cultural tourism, asserting the truth that \"The Bean,\" a \"yes, and ...\" sculpture for the social-media age of the Second City, has replaced the Picasso — for all its brilliance, a rusty, jarring, \"no, but\" presence — as the artistic talisman, and premiere symbol, of the capital of the Middle West.\nChicago's Christmas tree moves to Millennium Park after almost 50 years After almost 50 years in Daley Plaza, Chicago's official Christmas tree this year will stand in Millennium Park.\nThe annual tree lighting ceremony is set for 5:30 p.m. Nov. 24 in the park near Michigan Avenue and Washington Street, according to the city's Department of Cultural Affairs and Special...\nAfter almost 50 years in Daley Plaza, Chicago's official Christmas tree this year will stand in Millennium Park.\nThe annual tree lighting ceremony is set for 5:30 p.m. Nov. 24 in the park near Michigan Avenue and Washington Street, according to the city's Department of Cultural Affairs and Special...\nRead the story Add the tree into the hybrid Millennium Park mix, and — assuming the overly prosaic Park Grill figures out that it now could be a combination of the Walnut Room and Tavern on the Green — it is not hard to imagine the exported vistas — all hot chocolate, ear muffs, poinsettias and smiles from the consummate American city.\nWhat took you so long, tree? It was boring without you over here in the park.\nFor most of the past generation, the stretch of Michigan Avenue that travels south of the Chicago River down to Congress Parkway has been the Loop's border, a thoroughfare that looked to the west for its inspiration, the Art Institute of Chicago notwithstanding. But Millennium Park changed all that, of course, beginning more than a decade ago. The revolution in that stretch of the famous thoroughfare will further pick up pace in coming months with the arrival of Hilton's LondonHouse hotel, in the historic London Guarantee Building at the corner of Michigan Avenue and Wacker Drive, directly south of the Chicago River; it is a telling repurposing of a building.\nThe Magnificent Mile heads to the north, but, as the coming hotel has been noting, wisely, in its pre-opening marketing, the Cultural Mile unspools to the south. That moniker is a creation of interested parties, for sure, but it still is gathering strength and identity. Next weekend, the Chicago Cultural Mile Association will host a Halloween Gathering, including the kind of parade that might once have wended through the Loop. Come Christmas, the Cultural Mile will have Chicago's official tree; the new site is not deep into Millennium Park, as some have presumed, but close to Michigan Avenue. A transitional presence, you might say.\nLet's look forward a year or two. Assuming it features something akin to the illuminated cube that you can find in Apple's Fifth Avenue store in New York, Apple's arrival in Pioneer Court is likely to explode the traffic in, and visibility of, the top of the mile cultural and the bottom of the mile magnificent. No wonder Tribune Tower is up for sale. Mix in the new development of the Chicago Riverwalk, and you can see that savvy tree is moving to where most of the cultural action is moving in Rahm's Chicago.\nYou'll even be able to see the Millennium Park tree from the top of Navy Pier's newly expanded — and shrewdly winterized — Ferris wheel. It would have been much harder to pick out in Daley Plaza.\nBut then Daley Plaza is looking very Old Chicago these days, very Daley, very \"Ferris Bueller,\" very \"Blues Brothers.\" The high-tech, culturally engined Chicago of the 21st century prefers a cultural park.\nAnd a smart tree knows which way the wind is blowing. \"O come, O come, Emmanuel.\"\ncjones5@tribune.com\n Entertainment", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56296b07/turbine/ct-ae-1025-jones-20151022", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5626d7d9/turbine/ct-chicago-christmas-tree-met-1021-20151020"], "published": "2015-10-23T01:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:24:37.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
