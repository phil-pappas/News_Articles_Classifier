Ian Somerhalder (Dan Steinberg/AP) \nThe short clip shows his character Damon Salvatore throwing a wet towel at his mate Alaric Saltzman, played by Matt Davis. “You know, clothes would be nice,” Alaric jokes as Damon stands there completely nude. \nMany fans adore the bromance between the two characters, while some are hoping for it to develop romantically. The pair even have a portmanteau: ‘Dalaric’. \nLittle wonder Ian teased the trailer with the message: “Why is Damon naked in this new Vampire Diaries trailer?” \nResponses have included: “OMG This Will Happen!” and “OMG I’m waiting for it Woot!” \nThe trailer also gives fans a glimpse of Damon waking up in a coffin. \nThe US supernatural series continues without Nina Dobrev, who starred as Elena Gilbert. “I always knew I wanted Elena’s story to be a six-season adventure, and within those six years I got the journey of a lifetime,” she said at the time of her departure.
