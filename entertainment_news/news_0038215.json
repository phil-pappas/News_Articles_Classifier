Comment Posted Oct. 22, 2015 at 12:01 AM Updated at 1:58 AM Posted Oct. 22, 2015 at 12:01 AM Updated at 1:58 AM Vincent D'Onofrio is going from Hell's Kitchen to being the top boss in Oz. The Marvel's Daredevil actor has been cast as the Wizard of Oz in Emerald City , NBC's 10-episode imagining of L. Frank Baum's beloved 14-book series, TVLine reports. D'Onofrio's version of the Wizard is no balloon-loving gent, though. He rules Oz through \"inspiration, fear and a tenuous accord with the grand witches.\" Emerald City offers a dark spin on the classic tale, following what happens when 20-year-old Dorothy Gale lands in Oz, where the all-powerful Wizard has outlawed magic, deadly warriors prowl, and wicked witches are free to plot their mischief. NBC un-cancels its Wizard of Oz event series Emerald City NBC revived Emerald City in April after killing the project in April 2014. True Detective Season 2 star Adria Arjona joined the show as Dorothy. Are you interested in seeing Emerald City ? What twists on The Wizard of Oz would you like to see?
