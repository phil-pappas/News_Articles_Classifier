(Photo: Virginia Sherwood, NBC)\n3 CONNECT 31 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Blindspot 's Jane Doe is a puzzle, in every sense of the word.\nThe amnesiac at the center of NBC's freshman ratings front-runner (Monday, 10 p.m. ET/PT) is initially defined by a nearly complete covering of tattoos, which she and a New York FBI team learn contain clues to a massive criminal conspiracy and her identity.\n\"There are a few that I can understand maybe what they would mean,\" says star Jaimie Alexander, who can spend more than seven hours in a makeup chair to achieve the full Jane, which entails having almost her entire body covered in temporary tattoos.\n\"I'm always pushing for us to show more of the tattoos, because they're an amazing part of the show. They're a character in themselves,\" she says.\nTV tattoos have gone from signifiers of personality to plot devices in Blindspot and other recent shows. In ABC's The Whispers , tattoos that cover amnesiac Sean (Milo Ventimiglia) provide clues to an existential threat, while foreign characters scripted on the torso of mystic Annora of the Alders (Katey Sagal) in FX's The Bastard Executioner (Tuesday, 10 p.m. ET/PT) have a different context.\nSean (Milo Ventimiglia) shows off tattoos that play into the mystery at the heart of ABC's \"The Whispers.\" (Photo: Eike Schroter, ABC)\n\"Tattoos back then were rare and very primitive,\" says Executioner creator Kurt Sutter, no stranger to TV tattoos as executive producer of FX's Sons of Anarchy . \"We'll understand what that writing is and how it feeds into the bigger mythology\" as the series progresses.\nThose shows follow in the tradition of the 2000 film Memento and Fox's Prison Break , a 2005-09 series that features a man with prison blueprints mapped on his body. Fox recently ordered a 10-episode sequel.\nFor Blindspot , \"I wanted to do some sort of treasure map show,\" says creator Martin Gero, who consulted with magician and puzzle creator David Kwong. The tattoos represent \"puzzles, riddles, logic games and they're also aesthetic works of art.\"\nFor the temporary tattoos, Blindspot relied on special-effects makeup artist Christien Tinsley, an Emmy winner who has worked on the films xXx and I Am Legend , along with Prison Brea k, FX's American Horror Story and HBO's upcoming Westworld . His transfer technique earned him a Technical Achievement Award from the motion picture academy.\nMichael Scofield (Wentworth Miller) mapped out prison details in his body tattoo in Fox's \"Prison Break,\" which has a sequel in the works. (Photo: Fox)\nTinsley's R&D efforts result in temporary tattoos that are \"better-lasting, look better on camera\" and take less time to apply, he says, which cuts costs and has helped make tattoos a more common sight in TV and film.\nThe application process isn't that different than it would be for a peel-off tattoo from a convenience store, but materials are far more advanced, and the preparation, which includes customized body scans and wraps, is meticulous.\n\"Imagine taking a piece of paper and having to wrap it around a basketball and not create any wrinkles,\" Tinsley says. \"We have to figure out how to have these flat appliqués curve around a human body and do it in such a way that it becomes multiple puzzle pieces that interlock together.\"\nThe growing presence of tattoos on TV and film reflects greater public acceptance, says Chris Nuñez, a judge on Spike's Ink Master competition (Tuesday, 10 p.m. ET/PT), who practices his art at HandCrafted in Florida.\n\"There's a lot of new clientele\" and it covers a wide age range, says Nunez, who believes reality tattoo shows have helped generate interest. \"The newer generations are adapting into it and almost finding it as a second skin. … It's more like buying an accessory that they just have to have.\"\n(Tinsley, the master of the temporary adornment, remarks that an increase in real tattoos, especially among the young, means \"a big business coming around the corner is tattoo removal.\")\nAnnora of the Alders (Katey Sagal) sports body tattoos that carry meaning in FX's \"The Bastard Executioner.\" (Photo: Ollie Upton, FX)\nBlindspot 's Alexander, who has nine tattoos of her own, says she has received a universally positive response when sporting the temporary works in public, save for an older couple who wouldn't share a Manhattan elevator with her.\n\"I've had a lot of people come up to me and ask who the artist is because they think they're real,\" says the actress, who will sometimes wear one application for a couple of days. \"Everybody is so intrigued by them\" — her included.\n\"There are so many I like,\" she says of her character's markings. \"I really like the mockingbird-crow on the left side of my neck. It's an abstract bird, sort of like a hybrid. I'm a huge fan of neck tattoos. They're sexy to me.\"\n3 CONNECT 31 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 //usat.ly/1LcpUZR TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/326a0ca33e9704d415ce0080adf618c24fdee74f/c=0-0-2120-2826&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/08/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635750806559017550-Jaimie-Alexander-Blindspot.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/08/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635750806559017550-Jaimie-Alexander-Blindspot.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c52c520db5fb7b0da96b550006415a1fd22a7358/c=173-0-2828-1996&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/635793241873305790-Katey-Sagal-The-Bastard-Executioner.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1LcpUZR", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/69b640615d5d386b2460f349cbb9683d0373dfb9/c=0-0-2327-3103&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/10/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/635793245144334758-Wentworth-Miller-Prison-Break.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e7c866b662bebf1efe4447b572ca408abb4efcc0/c=170-0-2830-2000&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/635793234963241495-136874-0062.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LcpUZR&text=Ink%20marks%20%27Blindspot%2C%27%20other%20tattoo%20shows&via=usatoday", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LcpUZR&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fa61df53765e947e32b6db7ce0e6f72964df8af0/r=284x400/local/-/media/2015/08/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635750806559017550-Jaimie-Alexander-Blindspot.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T01:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T04:49:31.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
