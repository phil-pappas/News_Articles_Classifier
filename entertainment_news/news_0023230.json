Cosby's lawyers had asked the judge to dismiss their suit, arguing that the remarks were personal opinions protected by the First Amendment and legal declarations made in his defence.\nBut in his ruling Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Mark Mastroianni rejected Cosby's bid to dismiss the case before it ever goes to a jury.\nThe women have accused Cosby of drugging them and then having unwanted sexual contact with them.\nRelated Stories Cosby loses another honorary degree, this time from Pennsylvania university", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:58:32.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
