We were all so overwhelmed and excited when we saw her. One thing that really stood out was how much she is like her character in the show \"Pretty Little Liars.\"\nShe plays sports like swimming in the show and in real life. Our favorite moment was when we asked her, \"What inspired you to write your book?\" She said, \"My fans did. All of you and the people outside waiting for me to come outside.\" And it was true, the fans were lined up all the way down the block.\nSee also 100 things for kids on LI We had such a great time and still can't believe we met Mitchell. We'll never forget this awesome time with her and we'll always remember what a nice person she is.\nComing soon: Newsday's Family newsletter, for things to do with kids, events, more.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:07:58.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
