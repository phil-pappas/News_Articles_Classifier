He was the trial's final witness.\nThe notes are from a 1957 love ballad written by composer Baligh Hamdi and appear throughout \"Big Pimpin',\" which was Jay Z's first major hit. Producer Timbaland paid $100,000 in 2001 to settle a claim about its usage.\nLawyers for Hamdi's nephew, Osama Ahmed Fahmy, contend that Jay Z and Timbaland do not have a valid right to use the song.\nClosing arguments are tentatively scheduled to begin Wednesday but the judge must settle several issues first.\n ", "external_links": ["http://analytics.apnewsregistry.com/analytics/v2/image.svc/AP/RWS/jsonline.com/MAI/334774201/E/prod/PC/Basic/AT/A"], "published": "2015-10-20T16:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:26:10.233+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
