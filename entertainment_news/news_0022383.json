(March 20 - April 19): There's nothing like putting the finishing touches on a deal to make you chipper! Dot all i's and cross all t's with confidence!\nTAURUS. (April 20 - May 20): This would be a good time to go on the charm offensive. You'll get a lot further than staying on the sour grapes defensive.\nGEMINI. (May 21 - June 20): Finances show flickering signs of life. But don't let up on the CPR until after the 27th. This is when you can sit back and breathe a sigh of relief.\nCANCER. (June 21 - July 21): A vote of confidence comes from an unlikely source. Not only will this brighten your day, but it also removes a financial obstacle.\nLEO. (July 22 - Aug. 22): You can bring heat or light to a confrontation. It's a question of approach. Keep matters light and breezy because no one's looking for a fight.\nVIRGO. (Aug. 23 - Sept. 22): You invite great expectations and enjoy the challenge of meeting them. But if you're experiencing some difficulties with that nowadays then lower the bar.\nLIBRA. (Sept. 23 - Oct. 22): Never underestimate the power of a reasonable explanation. It's the fact that it's no frills that hammers the point home.\nSCORPIO. (Oct. 23 - Nov. 21): Don't make someone stay against his/her will. Enforcing a pledge gives you the upper hand now, but this person will make you regret the arm-twisting later.\nSAGITTARIUS. (Nov. 22 - Dec. 20): If you want an apology, then be gracious about it. Standing there with arms akimbo won't make it forthcoming.\nCAPRICORN. (Dec. 21 - Jan. 19): Signals have gotten crossed and you may be reading no when the other person is saying yes. Be upfront and ask where things stand.\nAQUARIUS. (Jan. 20 - Feb. 17): You shouldn't have any second thoughts about parting company. You'd be amazed by how easily replaceable this person you're saying good-bye to is.\nPISCES. (Feb. 18 - March 19): A loved one faces a difficult choice. Even if you know what's best, keep it to yourself. What's needed right now is support, not advice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:21:13.555+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
