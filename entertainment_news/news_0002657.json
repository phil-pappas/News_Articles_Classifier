Chronic high blood sugar levels are toxic to your body, destroying organs and blood vessels and paving the way to a heart attack, type 2 diabetes, stroke, dialysis, nerve damage, erectile dysfunction or even blindness.\nThe good news? Out-of-control sugar levels can be reigned in and regulated with the right foods.\nPrevention magazine, published by Rodale of Emmaus, turned to \"The Carb Sensitivity Program,\" naturopathic doctor Natasha Turner's breakthrough book, to find the most potent blood sugar-lowering foods so you know how to lower blood sugar levels naturally.\nMANGOS\n1 Mangos may taste sugary sweet, but this delicious fruit may actually lower blood sugar, according to research published in the journal Nutrition and Metabolic Insights. \"Our results indicate that daily consumption of 10 grams of freeze-dried mango, which is equivalent to about one-half of a fresh mango (about 100 grams), may help lower blood sugar in obese individuals,\" explains Edralin Lucas, associate professor of nutritional sciences at Oklahoma State University, College of Human Sciences and lead study author.\nCINNAMON\n2 A 2003 study in the journal Diabetes Care showed that cinnamon may cause muscle and liver cells to respond more readily to insulin, thereby improving weight loss. Better response to insulin means better blood sugar balance and, therefore, less insulin released into your body.\nOLIVE OIL\n3 Olive oil, rich in the same monounsaturated fat found in avocados, prevents not only belly fat accumulation, but also insulin resistance. Bonus: olive oil encourages the release of the appetite-suppressing hormone leptin.\nwww.prevention.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T01:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:36:34.746+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
