(Photo: Courtesy DCCA) CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nIsraeli artist Ariane Littman’s exhibition, “Healing,” on display now through Jan. 3 at the Delaware Center for the Contemporary Arts, uses three works to explore thorny relations between Palestinians and Israelis and a country under siege. \nThe installation features an operating table stocked with medical instruments, a collaged map of bandages stitched together with green thread (referencing Israel’s much-contested “green line” demarcation), and a video trilogy. In the video series, Littman presents performances filmed on the shores of the Dead Sea, the Hizma checkpoint and among the ruins of the Palestinian village of Lifta. \nThe exhibition is part of a year-long project celebrating Israeli arts and culture in Delaware, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. On Thursday, Oct. 15, Littman will discuss her work from noon to 1 p.m. at the DCCA, 200 South Madison St. in Wilmington, followed by a dessert reception. Both the reception and exhibition are free. www.thedcca.org or 302-656-6466 \n-Margie Fishman Read or Share this story: http://delonline.us/1LkqhBR MORE STORIES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:27:53.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
