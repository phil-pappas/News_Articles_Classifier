Jason Haag in Fredericksburg, Va. They have been together three years. Haag was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress and traumatic brain injury after returning from two tours in the Middle East. “He saved my life, no doubt about that. I was at my wit’s end,\" Haag said. “He helped me get off 30 pills, including 12 narcotics. He helped with panic attacks, flashbacks and nightmares. He brought me medicine when I was on those and helped me find my keys and truck because of memory issues.”(Chris Valenziano/Crown Media United States, LLC via AP)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T18:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:50:08.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
