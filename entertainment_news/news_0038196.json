Productions Secures Motion Picture Rights to JONESTOWN\nLos Angeles, CA, September 27, 2015 --( PR.com )-- Independent production company You Did It! Productions (“YDIP”) has secured film rights to the screenplay JONESTOWN, written by Jeffrey Goldman. JONESTOWN is the true story of Reverend Jim Jones, who headed the Peoples Temple and ended up orchestrating the mass murder-suicide of 909 of its members in Jonestown, Guyana in 1978.\nJoining Devin Cutler, Stewart Hall, and Lee Ettinger, who are producing the film, is Joseph Nathan Weisman, who will serve as Executive Producer.\nIn JONESTOWN, we follow the rise and the tragic and horrific fall of Jim Jones as he leads the Peoples Temple into infamy. Simultaneously, we learn the story of Bethany Gibbs, a teenager who falls under the Reverend’s sway and, like many others, is drawn into the bizarre world of the cult.\n“We are extremely pleased to team with Jeffrey Goldman and Joseph Nathan Weisman to bring this compelling story to the screen,” said Devin Cutler. “Many of us remember Jonestown as a shocking and unthinkable episode in our lives, and this film will illuminate for us many of the circumstances leading up to and surrounding that event. Additionally, for those who are too young to remember these events personally, this film will provide a gripping account of a tragedy that should never be forgotten.”\n“I am very excited to be partnered with YDIP on this film,” said Joseph Nathan Weisman. “The powerful script provides an excellent vehicle for both male and female A-Level talent to sink their teeth into, and the final film will be moving and harrowing.”\nAbout You Did It!
