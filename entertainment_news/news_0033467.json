Few directors have made more blockbusters than Steven Spielberg. Is there a director with more commercial hits than Steven Spielberg?\nThe all-star director returns to theaters this weekend with another Tom Hanks collaboration, \"Bridge of Spies\" — which will likely be a huge hit and get several awards considerations, if Speilberg’s track record says anything.\nOf the dozens of films Spielberg has directed, here are his top 10 hits:\n10. \"The Adventures of Tintin\" — $374 million\nThis one might surprise diehard Spielberg fans, as it only made $77 million in North America, but added a stunning $296 million outside the continent.\nThere is a sequel on the way.\n9. \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" — $389.9 million\nOne of four Spielberg films that, adjusted for inflation, would be in the top 20 grossing films of all-time in the United States.\n8. \"Jaws\" — $470.7 million\nUniversal Pictures/Getty Images \"Jaws\" was a game-changer for Spielberg. The film that launched Spielberg's career as a genre-crossing, franchise-making blockbuster director. Would have made over $2 billion today if adjusted for inflation.\n7. \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" — $474.2M\nNo \"Indiana Jones\" film has made less money than the one that came before it. It had the highest gross worldwide of any film released in 1989.\n6. \"Saving Private Ryan\" — $481.8 million\nDAVID JAMES/AP Tom Hanks and Tom Sizemore appear in a scene from the movie \"Saving Private Ryan.\" The film that won Spielberg his second Oscar for Best Director, \"Ryan\" has also earned $44 million in home video sales alone.\n5. \"War of the Worlds\" — $591.7 million\nTom Cruise and Dakota Fanning in \"War of the Worlds.\" A film shrouded in secrecy up until its release (and put out just two months after star Tom Cruise had jumped all over Oprah's couch) no non-sequel Spielberg film since has done better business at the box office.\n4. \"The Lost World: Jurassic Park 2\" — $618.6 million\nNot quite at the levels of its original critically or financially, but only \"Titanic\" made more money in 1997.\n3. \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\" — $786.6 million\nEvery now and then you hear rumors of yet another \"Indiana Jones\" film, and the box office largesse of this 2008 sequel — in which Shia LeBouf appears to be given Indy's mantle — which was the second highest-grossing film of the year.\n2. \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\" — $792.9 million\nAdjusting for era-appropriate inflation, \"E.T.\" would end up with a higher gross that \"Jurassic,\" but it'll settle for having been the highest-grossing film of all time for 11 years following its release.\n1. \"Jurassic Park\" — $1.02 billion\n©Universal/Courtesy Everett Collection/©Universal/Courtesy Everett Col Richard Attenborough, Laura Dern and Sam Neill in \"Jurassic Park.\" After decades of generation-defining films, none of Spielberg's films have had the financial impact of \"Jurassic.\"\nWhen 2018's sequel to \"Jurassic World\" is released, it will have officially spawned more sequels than any other Spielberg film.\nslepore@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories 'Jaws' turns 40: Steven Spielberg's shark opus made waves Hanks, Spielberg de-classify 'Bridge of Spies' trailer Spielberg to direct sci-fi film ‘Ready Player One' Jennifer Lawrence to play war photographer in Spielberg pic Tags: lists , news break , steven spielberg", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/nMhfESAa4tw", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ua_4ajpP58", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/XkkzKHCx154", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/a6JB2suJYHM", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/qYAETtIIClk", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/CIkOdrJGNy0"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:38:09.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
