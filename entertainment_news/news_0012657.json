(Photo: Jaap Buitendijk)\n11 CONNECT 23 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Mark Rylance has played princes, kings and even Queen Cleopatra during his long and storied theater career.\nAll that experience couldn't keep the nerves at bay on his first day filming Bridge of Spies (in theaters Friday) with director Steven Spielberg looking down the lens at him and Tom Hanks on the other side of the room. And when you ask Rylance about it, he doesn’t know why you wouldn’t have the jitters, too.\n\"These fellas know what they’re doing!” the affable Rylance says, laughing. “It’s like being asked to play as the doubles partner of Roger Federer. You’re on your toes. You’re thinking, ‘You’ve got to be awake here.’ ”\nUSA TODAY\nSpielberg builds A ‘Bridge’ to Cold War era\nMainstream film audiences will get a proper introduction to Rylance with his widely praised Bridge of Spies performance as Rudolf Abel, the Soviet spy who’s arrested on American soil at the height of the Cold War and defended by insurance lawyer James B. Donovan (Hanks).\nBut his resume as a stage actor, director and playwright is itself a work of supreme art. Rylance, 55, spent a decade as the first artistic director of Shakepeare’s Globe Theatre in London. He has three Tony Awards to his credit and played all the Bard’s big guys: Macbeth, Romeo, Henry V, Hamlet and Richard II, the latter three of which he also performed on television. The actor has been Shakespearean women, too, playing the female half of Antony and Cleopatra and having a Tony-winning turn as the countess Olivia in Twelfth Night on Broadway.\nIn addition to being a stage actor, Mark Rylance has also been a theater director and playwright in his career. (Photo: Amy Sussman, Invision via AP)\nFor those who missed all that — or his Emmy-nominated turn as Thomas Cromwell on PBS Masterpiece ’s Wolf Hall — Spielberg thinks moviegoers will see what makes Rylance special in his quiet and subtle Spies performance.\n“He’s just so open,” the director says. “For a spy, there’s something emotionally uncensored about his performance. And yet when he says, ‘They took me somewhere hot and tried to get me to be a double agent and I wouldn’t do it,’ you believe he gave nothing up. And you also believe that he never would.”\nRylance acknowledges that the challenge came in capturing Abel’s secrecy and “his relaxed attitude in a situation where most of us would be in a rather high state of anxiety.” He heard that about the real-life Abel, who died at the age of 68 in 1971, from the artists he lived among before he was arrested.\nUSA TODAY\nDamian Lewis, Mark Rylance rule 'Wolf Hall'\nWhat also struck Rylance was Abel's vigilance about his painting. He wasn’t very good, but wanted to learn to be better and befriended a much younger Brooklyn man who gave him lessons.\nWhile working as part of a spy ring, “he took interest in this craft and this artwork,” Rylance says of Abel. “It was more than just a cover that he did in a cold, calculating way.\n“Like all painters, he was someone who was interested in taking time to observe people and observe nature and life. He was a natural observer.”\nSurveillance is key to spycraft but also for actors, according to Rylance. He’s even engaged in some of his own professional subterfuge, of the most innocent kind: Rylance has interviewed people, even friends, and secretly recorded them to listen to the rhythm and dialect of their speech for roles.\nMark Rylance (right, with Stephen Fry) won a Tony Award for playing Olivia in Shakespeare's 'Twelfth Night.' (Photo: Geraint Lewis)\n“Almost like a scientist trying to study something without your presence changing the nature of the thing you’re studying, I want to present people as they are, not with them putting on their best face to me,\" Rylance says. \"In that way, there’s a gentle beneficent espionage to my work.\n“I never shared the recordings with anyone and it’s probably illegal that I do this — maybe I shouldn’t be telling you — but it’s my way of taking notes. I don’t want to be looking down at a pad.”\nUSA TODAY\nReview: 'Bridge of Spies' is one to savor\nJust like Abel, Rylance is maintaining secrecy and won’t spill any details about his role as a Big Friendly Giant in The BFG , an adaptation of the Roald Dahl children’s book and his next collaboration with Spielberg that hits theaters July 1.\n“I remember when I played Hamlet, I swore I would never do interviews about Hamlet,” Rylance says. “I was so fed up hearing other people’s opinions on who Hamlet was — people who weren’t playing him or who had never played him. It’s like being told who you are by a policeman or by your dad or by a shrink, and saying, ‘You have no idea who I am.’ ”\nThat's code for he can’t really talk about his giant yet. “BFG is still too close to me and I love him too deeply.”\n11 CONNECT 23 TWEET LINKEDIN //usat.ly/1LxiekZ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/64c1fca882ecac615c3273f3318fccf9d566399a/c=0-207-3423-3630/local/-/media/2015/04/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/635634986551662365-01RYLANCE-LEWIS-VERT-WOLFHALL.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b33d303fe5aaa681024b49b940017a0eee3f734e/c=0-854-3251-4105/local/-/media/2015/10/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635796374309660646-XXX-STEVEN-SPIELBERG---BRIDGE-OF-SPIES-PORTRAIT-TP-76350664.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635803733909731613-SJP-JB-D25-04091.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1I607jn", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LxiekZ&text=Mark%20Rylance%20brings%20artistry%20to%20%27Spies%27&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/27f6664fb8ef48299f06ee96e2d6771613497b2a/c=170-0-2830-2000&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635803733909731613-SJP-JB-D25-04091.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/07/29906170001_4388582836001_video-still-for-video-4388327943001.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://usat.ly/1LxiekZ", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/07/29906170001_4388582826001_thumbnail-for-video-4388327943001.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/aeaa32589d0bf398f86024a042e015dc99f148f6/c=344-972-3876-3627&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635803788272492090-MARK-RYLANCE-57919816.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635803733909731613-SJP-JB-D25-04091.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fe5ab570d158124879e00c424cfa7aa35f5b7a13/c=278-0-2938-2000&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635803741621641048-AP-MARK-RYLANCE-PORTRAIT-SESSION-76572874.JPG", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/07/29906170001_4388582836001_video-still-for-video-4388327943001.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LxiekZ&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cb8ddbb073f66e10cc0ef760660b92ba02554a6b/c=0-242-4747-2924&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/10/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635796374598262496-XXX-BRIDGEOFSPIES02-MOV-DCB-74793468.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34f3c12e46e775b6bc7e523d797ba40d553715a7/r=540&c=540x304/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/07/29906170001_4388582836001_video-still-for-video-4388327943001.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-16T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T17:07:25.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
