Promoted stories \nCharlie Hislop, of Southampton Festivals and co-founder of SO: To Speak, said: “We are less than two weeks from launching Southampton’s first festival of words and we are hugely excited to show everybody what we have been working on over these last months. There is such a dynamic programme on offer, from Amanda Prowse to Shakespeare in a Car Park, that there really is something for everyone. We hope that SO: To Speak will help show what a vibrant and creative city Southampton really is.” Share article \nMatt West, of Artful Scribe, added: “SO: To Speak will be a fantastic celebration of Southampton’s creative scene and also offer a great chance for people to try their hand at writing or performing. Over the ten days there are events going on all day, every day, so I would urge anyone who is curious to get involved and go to the events that catch their eye. We look forward to seeing you there!” \nFor further information please visit www.sotospeakfestival.org or, to purchase tickets, call the Mayflower Box Office on 02380 711811.
