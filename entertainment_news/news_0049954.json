(Bob Edme/The Associated Press) Neil Young’s show Sunday, Oct. 4, at WaMu Theater burst with grit, passion and energy. Special to The Seattle Times Concert review \nAt 69, Neil Young may seem a bit old to be playing the rebel. But the role suits him well on the current Rebel Content Tour, a politically charged trek supporting his environmentally themed, anti-corporate “Monsanto Years” album. \nBursting with grit, passion and energy, Young was backed by Promise of the Real, a five-member band featuring singer-guitarists Lukas and Micah Nelson, the sons of country legend Willie Nelson. \nYoung clearly enjoyed his interaction with the two younger musicians, who joined him in multiple, explosive guitar jams in which the musicians faced off in tight circles. The classic “Down by the River” grew into an extended, 20-minute jam — a highlight of the latter half of the show. \nBy contrast, the first half of the concert was somewhat mellow. It began when two actors dressed as old-time farmers scattered seeds about the stage. Later, actors wearing hazmat suits sprayed the seeds with pesticides (in the form of stage fog), a dig at agricultural giant Monsanto.
