The movie chronicles what happens when a husband and wife try to work out their marital troubles while visiting a French resort in the 1970s. When you do a film with that kind of subject matter, the personal life questions are bound to come up in press interviews leading up to the movie's release.\nWhile talking with Vogue magazine, Jolie said the film is not autobiographical, though she added, \"Brad and I have our issues, but if the characters were even remotely close to our problems we couldn't have made the film.\"\nShe added, \"As artists we wanted something that took us out of our comfort zones,\" she said. \"Just being raw actors. It's not the safest idea. But life is short.\"\nJolie and Pitt got to know each other on the set of the 2005 movie, \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith.\" They got engaged in 2012 after seven years together and tied the knot in August 2014.\nJolie is featured in the November cover story in Vogue. Go here for more.\n\"By the Sea\" opens on Nov. 13.", "external_links": ["http://www.vogue.com/13357646/angelina-jolie-pitt-november-2015-cover/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/lENyWGjAzdI"], "published": "2015-10-16T23:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:28:08.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
