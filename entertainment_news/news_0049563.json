Several appeared skeptical of the agency policing what is considered offensive. \nCircuit Judge Kimberly Moore asked what would happen if the government began rejecting copyrights for controversial art or other expressive works, as it is doing with trademarks. \nWould there be \"no more porn? No more crucifixes in urine?\" she asked, referring to an infamous 1987 photograph known as Piss Christ. \nThe federal government is trying to maintain the agency's power to reject certain trademarks, saying it is not required to actively help those who would use racial epithets and disparaging images in the marketplace. \nDaniel Tenny, an attorney with the U.S. Department of Justice, told the judges that the law governing trademark registrations does not violate the First Amendment. Its purpose is not \"to help people to make a political statement or prevent people from making political statements,\" he said. \n(Reporting by Andrew Chung; Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Bill Rigby ) \nOur top photos from the past 24 hours.
