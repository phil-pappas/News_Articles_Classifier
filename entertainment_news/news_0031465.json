Now here comes in some big news on the news desk! We all are aware of the major fall of Sony TV's TRP ratings despite the desperate attempts being made by the channel to introduce engaging shows of varied genres. Of what we hear, the channel is now planning to take all its shows off-air by the end of October and revamp the channel! Our sources inform us that all the shows might be pulled off air by October 20 except for the channel's new launch, 'Pyaar Ko Ho Jaane Do' which will telecast for an hour. When we contacted the PR team to confirm the development, they said, \"We do not have any information about this as of now. The channel is preparing to launch two more shows post Pyaar Ko Ho Jaane Do.\" Hmmm.... With Sony TV's sister concern, SAB TV introducing new shows and constantly pulling shows off-air within a short span of time, we wonder if SAB TV will also undergo a revamp soon!
