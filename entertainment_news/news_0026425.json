They have firmly rejected the Shiv Sena on both the right to have freedom of expression and the need to promote Indo-Pak. dialogue and normalisation of our relations.” \nA day after the attack on Kulkarni, Shiv Sena’s mouthpiece ‘Saamna’ compared him with 26/11 terrorist Ajmal Kasab and referrred him as a ‘lover of Pakistan’. \nThe editorial in Saamna said, “Pakistan do not need people like Kasab to carry outr destructive activities in India, when persons like Kulkarni are present in the country”. \n“The real threat to India is not from extremist Muslims, but from the people like Kulkarni,” it said. \nOn Monday Sena members barged into the BCCI office, protesting against Shahryar Khan, member of Pakistan Cricket Board. After the incident the PCB chairman had called IPL chief Rajiv Shukla but the talks on Indo-Pak series are still on hold. \nAfter the BCCI incident the social media went crazy, criticising against Sena ‘workers’. \nInstead of millions of criticism the Saamna on Tuesday carried out a front page headline, “Shiv Sena kaa yorker, BCCI clean Bold”. \n  4:31 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T14:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:09:58.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
