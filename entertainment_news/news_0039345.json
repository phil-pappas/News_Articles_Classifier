(Nick Briggs/ITV) \nCarson proposed to Mrs Hughes in last year’s Christmas special, ending a long wait for hopeful fans. \nNow, as the popular ITV show nears the end of its run, the couple will make it official in an intimate ceremony, attended by their friends and family from the estate. (Nick Briggs/ITV) \nThe butler and head housekeeper made a stylish couple in complimentary mauve and grey. \nMr Carson (Jim Carter) looked like the cat that had got the cream, beaming in a dapper three-piece suit as he clutched on to his new wife outside the church. (Nick Briggs/ITV) \nMrs Hughes, played by Phyllis Logan, smiled broadly in a beaded mauve coat, dress and hat, while holding a beautiful bouquet of flowers. \nThere’s no word yet on whether any lucky lady catches Mrs Hughes’ bouquet, but there were certainly many options in the pews. (Nick Briggs/ITV) \nViolet Crawley, the Dowager Countess, paid her good wishes to the couple alongside Lord and Lady Grantham, Lady Mary and Lady Edith. (Nick Briggs/ITV) \nAmong the household staff celebrating were close friend Mrs Patmore, Daisy Mason, Moseley, Gladys Denker and the happily married Mr and Mrs Bates.
