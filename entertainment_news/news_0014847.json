And I mean we're enforcing it against anyone, including you,'\" he said. \"So don't try me. Don't try me. Because I'll do it.\" Got it, buddy?\nJust in case he didn't make himself clear the first time, Christie later told Fox News what he'd do if Russian warplanes breached the aforementioned no-fly zone: \"You take [them] down.\" But Americans needn't worry themselves over the New Jersey strongman's apparent eagerness to kick off WWIII, as he will never be president .", "external_links": ["http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/10/trump_and_carson_lead_2016_gop_field_as_christie_h.html", "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/10/12/calling-obama-a-weakling-chris-christie-says-he-would-shoot-down-russian-planes-over-syria/?src=twr"], "published": "2015-10-13T04:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:06:34.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
