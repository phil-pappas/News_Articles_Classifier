Chicago style bungalows and vintage condos are often remodeled to fit this idea, often even knocking down walls to create an open space where people can gather.\nBut the ideal kitchen in the Windy City didn’t always look or function the way it does today. 60 years ago, the kitchen was viewed as a strictly functional, bare-bones part of the home. It was typically a separate room on the main floor, and architects didn't devote much square footage to it, as homeowners didn't demand it. Today, things are very different.\n\"Today, the kitchen is viewed as the heart and soul in the home,\" said Kim Garretson, former new products editor for Better Home and Gardens. Currently, as a professor of journalism at the University of Missouri, Garretson tracks innovation trends across several industries. \"New technology in appliances has also evolved into the brains of the home.\"\nThis is because families spend more time in their kitchens. Whether it’s pulling stools up to the center island for a casual breakfast with friends or kids doing their homework at the table while dinner is being prepared, the “foodie” movement in America has demanded the kitchen has a much broader everyday use.\nThis hasn’t just affected the overall feel of the space. The components of the kitchen, especially appliances, have evolved to suit its new central role in the home .\nAppliances used to be the least-flashy part of a kitchen, purely utilitarian machines designed without looks in mind. Today, appliances are either camouflaged — think a refrigerator hidden by panels that match the kitchen cabinets — or, more often, they’re meant to be shown off.\nBlack stainless steel is used on many high-end appliance brands and has brought not only a sleek and stylish look to the kitchen, but fingerprint-resistant finishes that wipe brilliantly clean.\nBe a game day hero with the perfect 'homegate' The trees are changing color in Lincoln Park, anglers are hooking salmon and trout along the lakeshore, the Cubs are toying with the fans at Wrigley, and just about everyone is thinking about football.

Evolving technology has shaped the way kitchens function on the whole. Appliances used to be basic, without any high-tech features. The tide really started to turn in the 1970s, according to Garretson, who saw many appliance manufacturers' \"kitchens of the future\" during his time at Better Homes and Gardens.\n\"[Appliance manufacturers] anticipated product advancements like magnetic induction and convection, and their kitchens of the future did talk about increasingly busy families being pulled in different directions, dual-working households, and time saving as a big focus,\" he said. \"In terms of technology and the function of appliances, those things did stick around.\"\nStick around, and then some. Today’s refrigerators come with more than 100 ways to organize shelving and drawers, helping any size household get the most out of their cold storage. Internet-connected refrigerators can be synced and controlled from mobile devices, allowing you to maximize energy savings when the fridge is nearly empty or bring on the cool when you need those beers icy for a post-work celebration.\nOversized gas ranges with double ovens maximize total capacity, with some approaching seven cubic feet of cooking space. Convection ovens circulate heat, ensuring that roast will quickly cook to juicy perfection. Ranges with sliding tops give home chefs options, form six burners at once to a fully-functioning griddle.\n60 years ago it was a dubious honor to be the person responsible for the pile of dirty dishes. Today, the dishwasher is an integral part of the Chicago kitchen — and they’re getting smarter. Now, many new dishwashers have sensors that calculate how many dishes are being washed and adjust the duration of the cycle accordingly.\nAnd who could forget the microwave? The now-ubiquitous small appliance, a product of the space age, would have been a dream come true for cooks in 1955. These days, the box is as wondrous as ever, quickly defrosting make-ahead meals for a quick dinner before the Cubs game or even reheating leftovers from Giordano’s.\nBut while today’s kitchen may be bright, open and “smart,” it’s the room’s ability to gather people and create lasting memories that has made the it the centerpiece of the home.\n-Marla Caceres, Tribune Content Solutions\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-55e9ebe3/turbine/ct-ss-hhgregg-be-a-game-day-hero-with-the-perfect-homegate-20150904dto", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560058f6/turbine/ct-ss-hhgregg-here-s-how-chicago-s-kitchens-went-from-functional-to-fabulous-20150917dto"], "published": "2015-09-21T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:20:09.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
