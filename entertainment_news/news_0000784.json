Gilbertson"], "text": "New albums in stores this week By Jon M. Gilbertson , Special to the Journal Sentinel Oct. 8, 2015 6:48 p.m. Associated Press Selena Gomez’s “Revival” is more provocative than her previous albums. \nSelena Gomez , \"Revival\" (Interscope). Former Disney Channel starlet and consistent tabloid magnet switches labels and alters her sound, using Christina Aguilera's \"Stripped\" as a template for maturity and employing helpers like Charli XCX and Max Martin to put heavier dance and R&B moves into a more provocative full-length. ••• \nCorb Lund , \"Things That Can't Be Undone\" (New West). Jason Isbell producer Dave Cobb joins Lund, who as a Canadian is even further than Isbell from the Nashville-country mainstream, for an album that, with its sharply defined music and careful arrangements of Lund's well-observed songs, could be his Isbellian breakthrough. ••• \nDaniel Martin Moore , \"Golden Age\" (OK Recordings/SofaBurn). Singer-songwriter Moore has been crafting songs for this album since 2007. Two other solo albums, two collaborative albums and one rarities/collaborations disc have interceded between then and the completion of a sturdily understated folk-pop set produced by My Morning Jacket's Jim James. \n— Jon M. Gilbertson, \nSpecial to the Journal Sentinel \nAlex G , \"Beach Music\" (Domino). Philadelphia fellow Alexander Giannascoli has moved from releasing music on Bandcamp to releasing music on the Domino indie label while maintaining his sole-creator status, playing and recording all this lo-fi pop in his bedroom. \nBoy & Bear , \"Limit of Love\" (Nettwerk). Recording live and straight to tape with producer Ethan Johns, the Sydney, Australia rock quintet learns how to do its version of modern rock — part Coldplay, part Ryan Adams — the old-fashioned way on its third full-length. \nAlison Brown , \"Song of the Banjo\" (Compass). Grammy-winning banjo player, who has a UCLA MBA and co-founded the label on which she releases her stuff, puts out her first new record since 2009 and turns her five-string talents toward seven originals and six covers from the 1970s and 1980s. \nAnn Hampton Callaway , \"The Hope of Christmas\" (MCG Jazz). Having written songs for Barbra Streisand, written and sung the theme for \"The Nanny\" TV show and picked up a Tony nomination as an actress, Callaway and her jazz collaborators don't have much trouble knocking out new tunes for the Yuletide season. \nCity and Colour , \"If I Should Go Before You\" (Dine Alone Music). After Toronto singer-songwriter Dallas Green worked with Alecia Moore, a.k.a. P!nk, on last year's You+Me debut \"Rose Ave.,\" he's jumped back into his City and Colour project determined to make its newest LP a bigger sound from a full band. \nElvis Costello , \"Unfaithful Music & Soundtrack Album\" (Universal). Across two CDs, Declan MacManus/Elvis Costello connects 38 of his songs with his new memoir, \"Unfaithful Music & Disappearing Ink,\" and adds two unreleased tracks, one from 1975. \nKorey Dane , \"Youngblood\" (Innovative Leisure). At 25, Long Beach folk musician Dane approaches rambling-man musings on his second solo album with the ease of a young Dylan and a simulated lack of self-consciousness that most of his contemporaries can't match. \nThe Decemberists , \"Florasongs\" (Capitol). Currently within the last few weeks of a tour for their latest album, this year's \"What a Terrible World, What a Beautiful World,\" the Decemberists offer five outtakes from that lively example of folk-rock stateliness. \nDilly Dally , \"Sore\" (Partisan). It could be argued that this Toronto four-piece does nothing new with ragged, womanly punk a la the Muffs, the Slits and Hole...but it could not be argued that its introductory long-player doesn't do that sort of thing very well and snottily. \nBob Forrest , \"Survival Songs\" (Six Degrees). Forrest, frontman for L.A. groups like the Bicycle Thief and Thelonious Monster before he got clean in 1996 presents older and newer material in a singer-songwriter phase. \nDonnie Fritts , \"Oh My Goodness\" (Single Lock). Although Fritts is 72 and his resume includes a keyboard gig for Kris Kristofferson and a key role in Muscle Shoals soul, \"Goodness\" is a rare solo LP. It's a greasy Southern affair packed with producers from Alabama Shakes and Civil Wars, plus John Prine, Jason Isbell, old Muscle Shoals pals and more. \nThe Game , \"The Documentary 2\" (eOne Music). West Coast rapper and Dr. Dre protégé marks the 10th anniversary of his album \"The Documentary\" with a sequel that's also a double album. The first part includes Dre, Kanye, Kendrick and Snoop; the second part drops next week. \nThe Garden , \"Haha\" (Epitaph). Wyatt and Fletcher Shears, identical twin brothers who have been known to moonlight as models, either hint at the electronic-driven next wave of Orange County punk or simply follow their own chic muse on their second full-length as the Garden. \nDavid Garrett , \"Explosive\" (Decca). Pussycat Dolls lead singer and dancer Nicole Scherzinger is the most prominent guest on the latest crossover record from a German-born violinist who this time covers Eminem, Ed Sheeran and Metallica. \nJohn Grant , \"Grey Tickles, Black Pressure\" (Partisan). Not remotely content with \"Pale Green Ghosts,\" the most baroque entry among the best indie albums of 2013, the darkly witty singer-songwriter growls more and tries more styles, including electronic pop, on his third solo album. Everything But the Girl's Tracey Thorn adds her luminosity to one song. \nHouston in the Blind , \"Limbs\" (Houston in the Blind). From Athens, Ga. — home to Drive-By Truckers as well as R.E.M. — come people from other groups like Dead Confederate to back Charlie Garrett, a bar-band veteran who's found his songwriting voice. \nIration , \"Hotting Up\" (Three Prong/Caroline). With members from Hawaii residing in Santa Barbara when not touring, Iration has solid island-music background, and on its latest long-player the distance from West Coast jam-band rock to Jamaican reggae isn't far. \nToby Keith , \"35 MPH Town\" (Show Dog Nashville/Universal). Brandy Clark, one of the hottest songwriters in country music, helped pen \"Drunk Americans,\" the first single from Toby Keith's 18th LP; nine other songs display Keith's balance of country-pop people-pleasing against classic-country dirt-road foundations. \nJana Kramer , \"Thirty One\" (Elektra Nashville). If Kramer is neither galaxies removed from her days on the TV series \"One Tree Hill\" nor as close as wants to be to strong neo-Nashville women like Lambert and Musgraves, her second album does eat up some of the distance. \nLang Lang , \"Lang Lang in Paris\" (Sony Classical). When the Chinese pianist finally performed at the Hall of Mirrors in the Palace of Versailles on June 22 this year, he took on Chopin's \"Scherzi\" and Tchaikovsky's \"The Seasons\" and also put them on tape at the Opera Bastille, as captured here. \nLittle May , \"For the Company\" (Dew Process/Capitol). If the National's Aaron Dessner deserves credit for adding resonant heft — via a 19th-century church in upstate New York — to the debut LP from Australian trio Little May, Little May deserves more credit for creating eerie folk-pop songs worthy of the heft. \nJesse Malin , \"Outsiders\" (One Little Indian/Velvet Elk). Former and, he's recently said, future D Generation frontman—a reunion has been vouchsafed—drops his second solo disc of the year, another lively collection of newfangled old-school rock. \nMayday Parade , \"Black Lines\" (Fearless). With its fifth album and headlining status on the Alternative Press Tour this month, the Tallahassee, Fla. rock band seems ready to provide another soundtrack to the earnest, angst-ridden hearts of current and former teenagers. \nJon McLaughlin , \"Like Us\" (Razor & Tie). An Indiana native who's opened for Kelly Clarkson and Billy Joel and toured with Sara Bareilles locates his central \"piano man\" as well as his family man on a new long-player whose relative sparseness won't repel pop fans. \nGlenn Mercer , \"Incidental Hum\" (Bar/None). As frontman for the Feelies, Mercer has been a pioneer of jangle-rock melodicism. On his second solo full-length, however, he's evoking all-instrumental atmospheres and covering Eno and Hendrix. \nMercyMe , \"MercyMe, It's Christmas!\" (Fair Trade Services/Columbia). Texas contemporary-Christian rock band that had a solid hit record with 2005's \"The Christmas Sessions\" returns to the bag o' chestnuts and pulls out some standards and some originals. \nMichael Monroe , \"Blackout States\" (Spinefarm). The lead singer of the cult-successful, Finnish, metallic-rock band Hanoi Rocks carries on with a rock classicist's dream of tattooed glam and overdriven energy on his latest solo disc. \nIsrael Nash , \"Israel Nash's Silver Season\" (Loose Music/Thirty Tigers). Named biblically, the singer-songwriter from the lyrically christened Dripping Springs, Texas turns his ranch into a hippie honky-tonk and his band into its house act on a full-length of mystic twang. \nNova Heart , \"Nova Heart\" (FakeLoveMusic). Despite its size and economic influence, Beijing lacks nearly any international fame regarding music coming from there, yet the Nova Heart trio generates mesmeric electronic pop-rock songs at once global and local, not unlike how Blondie was via NYC in the 1970s. \nOberhofer , \"Chronovision\" (Glassnote). Brad Oberhofer, has a true Brooklynite's brashness on the retrograde glistening and hip-thrusting dares of the messily rockin' second long-player to emerge from the band that bears his surname. \nOctober Sky , \"Rise\" (October Sky). On a five-song EP, the October Sky duo — Montreal's Karl Raymond and Alex Racine — utilize a pop-prog stomp as a kind of bodacious bludgeon with which to beat anyone who claims it doesn't have its rock bona fides in order. \nOf Montreal , \"Snare Lustrous Doomings\" (Polyvinyl). Initially released on Record Store Day last April, the 19-track, 90-minute capsule of Kevin Barnes and Company's career-spanning indie-pop live-show extravaganza gets wider distribution. \nOutasight , \"Big Trouble\" (RPM MSC Distribution). Producer, singer, songwriter and rapper Richard \"Outasight\" Andrew actualizes his stage name via his second studio LP, a mélange of hip-hop, funk and soul stylings that could appeal to the goofier side of Mark Ronson fans. \nR. City , \"What Dreams Are Made Of\" (Kemosabe/RCA). Thanks in part to Maroon 5 sexpot Adam Levine, R. City a.k.a. Rock City has a huge hit, \"Locked Away\"; now, the two Thomas brothers from the Virgin Islands move from that hit and their work with the likes of Rihanna toward a proper first long-player as Caribbean hip-hoppers in their own right. \nReverend and the Makers , \"Mirrors\" (Cooking Vinyl). Former Oasis songwriter and older brother Noel Gallagher has mouthed kind words about the fifth album from Reverend and the Makers, a Yorkshire group that leans as much toward Britpop as toward indie-er sounds. \nSaintseneca , \"Such Things\" (ANTI-/Epitaph). Columbus, Ohio folk-rock quintet turns around quickly after last year's \"Dark Arc\" to make a third full-length that puts its happiest, most vocally harmonious pop limb forward. \nSt Germain , \"St Germain\" (Nonesuch). French house-music producer Ludovic Navarre hasn't released a new full set in 15 years, attributing the gap partly to perfectionism partly to an exploration of African sounds — Malian in particular — fused to his continuing fascination with jazz and blues in a dance floor context. \nDuncan Sheik , \"Legerdemain\" (Kobalt Music). Tony- and Grammy-winning theatrical and pop composer uses drum machines and other EDM tools to roil some Teflon tension into material basically unaffiliated with any stage productions and his first collection of all-original songs since 2006. \nJake Shimabukuro , \"Travels\" (eOne Music). A ukulele virtuoso even by the presumably higher standards of his Honolulu home, Shimabukuro has taken himself and the instrument 'round the world and reflects on all those miles and movements on his latest disc. \nVarious artists , \"The Light Princess (Original Cast Recording)\" (Mercury Classics/Universal Music Classics). The first musical from Spooky Girl Tori Amos and Australian playwright Samuel Adamson adapts George MacDonald's fairy tale, published in 1864, into Amosian ethereality with a London cast and two new songs sung by Amos herself. \nVulfpeck , \"Thrill of the Arts\" (Vulf). Banned by Spotify for getting its fans to help it actually make money from the streaming service, this collective — Ann Arborites who met in a German-lit class and now live in L.A. — isn't just clever; it's also so white and so funky. \nJoe Louis Walker , \"Everybody Wants a Piece\" (Provogue/Mascot Label Group). San Francisco guitarist and singer turned 65 last year, but that hasn't pushed him into retiring from a half-century career that has helped advance the blues as a cause and as an art form. \nW.A.S.P. , \"Golgotha\" (Napalm). Four years in the making and ending a six-year pause since its last studio record, the 15th studio slab from the L.A. heavy-metal band reflects the cared-for voice of Blackie Lawless and also reflects his perspective as a born-again Christian. \nThe Zombies , \"Still Got That Hunger\" (The End). More than 50 years after \"She's Not There\" enshrined the Zombies among the British Invasion second-stringers, founding members Rod Argent and Colin Blunstone drop a taut, yet expansive, pop-rock LP as part of the latest iteration of the group. © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc.
