The former Beatle released his 18th studio LP \"Postcards from Paradise\" in March, and a semi-biographical photo book called \"Photograph\" in September. Look for a few tracks of \"Postcards\" to be played Sunday, as well as his earlier hits \"It Don't Come Easy\" and \"You're Sixteen.\" \nWhen: Sunday at 8 p.m. \nWhere: State Theatre, 15 Livingston Ave., New Brunswick \nHow much: Tickets from $65 available here. MISFITS \nWhat: Horror-punk and Halloween fit together like blood and gore, so naturally Lodi legends Misfits will return to Jersey for another holiday show in Sayreville. These days, a Danzig-less band sees bassist Jerry Only on lead vocals and this weekend, the group will revisit 1978's \"Static Age\" (officially released in 1997). The Zombie Mafia, Negative Traction and Enrage will open. \nWhen: Friday at 7 p.m. \nWhere: Starland Ballroom, 570 Jernee Mill Rd., Sayreville \nHow much: Tickets are $22, available here. YOUNG THE GIANT \nWhat: California electro-rockers Young The Giant continue to tour on their sophomore LP, 2014's \"Mind Over Matter.\" While the five-piece from Irvine has not yet produced another rock radio smash like \"Cough Syrup\" or \"My Body,\" through a ton of touring they have developed a reputation as a striking live act. The Los Angeles rock band Wildling will open. \nWhen: Saturday at 8 p.m. \nWhere: Wellmont Theater, 5 Seymour St., Montclair \nHow much: Tickets from $20 available here. (Not many left) JOE GRUSCHECKY \nWhat: The last time Pittsburgh's Joe Grushecky and the Houserockers played Asbury Park, a certain Jersey legend joined the band from a two-hour surprise set. But Bruce Springsteen has already said he's not performing at either of the gritty rocker's Stone Pony shows this weekend. Fans who sold out each night in hopes of a repeat are surely disappointed, but Grushecky's decades-long career can still command an evening. \nWhen: Friday at 7 p.m.; Saturday at 8 p.m. \nWhere: The Stone Pony, 913 Ocean Ave., Asbury Park \nHow much: Both shows sold out, but tickets available on StubHub from $16. \nBobby Olivier may be reached at bolivier@njadvancemedia.com.
