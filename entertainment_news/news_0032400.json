The PSA is available to grassroots organizations for use on websites, social networks and during live community events. A version of the spot will target states such as Ohio where marijuana legalization measures are on the ballot. Entitled “ Very Presidential ,” the PSA Quote: s former President Richard Nixon as he speaks frankly against his own committee’s findings that marijuana is less harmful than previously thought and recommended decriminalizing it for personal use.\n“When we started this effort, we knew it would be a long haul because it takes time to build an effective campaign, especially on a controversial subject such as this,” Bowler says. “Our first round of TV and radio PSAs were well received by organizations like NORML, Marijuana Policy Project and Drug Policy Alliance, who shared them with thousands via their large social media networks. This latest spot fills in another piece of the puzzle by examining the so-called ‘war on drugs,’ specifically marijuana, from a political perspective.”\n‘Patent’ Hypocrisy:\nDigging deep into this issue, Bowler has discovered a number of alarming facts, not least of which is that while the DEA fights to keep marijuana a schedule 1 drug (considered most dangerous), the US Department of Health and Human Services actually holds a patent on the medical use of marijuana that states, Bowler says, that marijuana is 'particularly advantageous' in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and HIV dementia. Click here to read the actual patent.\n“When you look at the whole picture with respect to the scheduling of marijuana – the arrests, incarcerations, fines, corruption, as well costs to the taxpayer for a drug that is demonstrably less dangerous than many others that are legal and commonly consumed -- one comes to the inescapable conclusion that the government’s position is untenable.” Bowler notes. “The only legitimate option is to de-schedule marijuana like the US government has done with alcohol and cigarettes. Regulate and tax it as a product. States like Colorado and Washington are already doing this to great effect.”\nBowler adds that while he got into this to help bring these astonishing facts to light, a professional offshoot has been discovering the talent within HOBO to write, produce, direct and score powerful and effective spots.\n“It’s gratifying to help organizations that are working tirelessly toward the same goal, and who very much need access to creative resources like the ones we offer,” Bowler says. “It’s an exciting time to be on the front-lines of this issue. As Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis said, if we desire respect for the law, we must first make the law respectable.”\nFor more information about HOBO’s End Prohibition Now campaign follow @TheGreenPoint ( https://twitter.com/the_greenpoint ) or contact HOBO at 212-967-6532 or info(at)hoboaudio.com\nAbout HOBO Audio:\nHOBO Audio is an audio post/creative content production company dedicated to creating an exceptional experience.
