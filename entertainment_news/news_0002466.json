She’s out, and while not quite proud, she is loud.\n“My secret shame is that I see psychics,” the Melbourne comic confesses. Perhaps best known in Sydney as an actor and star of the likes of ABC sitcom Utopia, Ten’s Offspring and upcoming ABC drama The Beautiful Lie, Pacquola is on her way with her comedy cap on to deliver her solo show Let Me Know How It All Works Out as part of next week’s Just For Laughs festival at the Opera House.\n“There are so many women in particular who are into this stuff but they don’t tell anyone and it doesn’t make you stupid, it just feels nice — it’s like a form of therapy because it feels nice having someone tell you everything is going to be OK even if they’re lying,” she says.\n“I’m not religious but, if you are, I won’t judge you, it’s just that I would rather listen to a woman in\na purple dress talk about me for half an hour.”\nBut the mood culturally is to pooh-pooh such inclinations, whether it be in the form of traditional religious practice, or up the New Age end mystic belief. So Pacquola was a little bit nervous before she unleashed the show.\n“Because no one talks about it, and it’s not cool to get on stage and talk about this kind of stuff, it’s so much cooler to get up and say you’re an atheist,” she points out.\nOther Stories Awesome All Blacks lay Cardiff ghosts to rest Rugby 0 comments Will Geoffrey ever find love again?

So how does it unfold?\n“In the UK I saw a palm reader who told me something I didn’t want to hear and so I got into a fight with him and that’s pretty much the show,” Pacquola says.\n“I’ve always been obsessed with knowing the end of stories and I love that bit at the end of movies when the screen goes black and they tell you what happens to the characters after the movie right up to the end of their lives.”\nIt began when she was 19 and on holiday in San Francisco with her mum and, since then, Pacquola estimates she’s seen perhaps 20 psychics over the past decade, dropping in to see them whenever the whim landed. “I do draw the line at dreamcatchers though, I mean come on,” she says.\nPacquola began her career in barnstorming fashion back in 2006, making it to the RAW finals after unknowingly being signed up by her then boyfriend.\n“It turns out he was this huge cheater and compulsive liar sex addict thing, but he was the basis for my first show so I owe him everything . Not only did he get me into stand-up comedy, he gave me a story for my first show that got me sent to Edinburgh (Fringe, the world’s biggest comedy festival), so I owe him everything,” she says.\nOne success followed another, so Pacquola hasn’t spent much time in Sydney, although she’s making up for it now, having supported John Oliver in his recent shows and now with Just For Laughs, her solo show paired with a spot in the All Star Gala alongside the likes of Danny Bhoy, Dave Hughes and Wil Anderson.\nBut first you can check out her efforts when Pacquola tackles her first straight dramatic role in the ABC TV show The Beautiful Lie, which begins\nthis Sunday.\n“It’s so much fun to do dramatic stuff because you get to do stuff you don’t do in real life, like I get to slam a door in my face eight times in a row in that show, I would never do that in real life,” she says.\nJust For Laughs All Star Gala, Concert Hall, Sydney Opera House, October 24, 7pm and 9.30pm, $79.90-$110.90; Celia Pacquola: Let Me Know How It All Works Out, Playhouse, Sydney Opera House, $34.90, 9250 7777, sydneyoperahouse.com", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/1b8196d378545a40b81428ac5c711d9c", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/99fcba8ae82c8c3a820d363ee6835cce", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c5cae69f6310b1ac75aa7260fd194394", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b0eb27853091a774fcb6de188930e46b", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/8f3fc487c88364970742ba4bbaf99415", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/273f8d21f4a54f0720388382dc1eee50", "http://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/whatson/jfl15_celia_pacquola.aspx", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-10-14T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T10:29:17.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
