(Jeffrey R. Staab / AP) Andrea Peterson The Washington Post Colbert is unabashed geek. \nOn Tuesday night, Stephen Colbert squeezed an entire orchestra onto his set. But it wasn't just any orchestra -- it was Legend of Zelda: Symphony of the Goddesses, a musical ensemble that performs music from the classic Nintendo video game series. \nThe concert was a celebration of self-aware geekiness -- an ode to the triumph of the nerd in mass American culture. But the same could be said for Colbert's entire incarnation of \"The Late Show.\" \nColbert is unabashed geek. His mastery of J.R.R. Tolkien lore was a staple of his Comedy Central show, \"The Colbert Report.\" The comedian even made a cameo in one of the Hobbit movies. And when Jon Stewart left the \"Daily Show,\" Colbert's tearful goodbye had a \"Lord of the Rings\" theme. \nFrom Dungeons & Dragons to comic books, other nerdy topics also got plenty of nods on the \"Report.\" In fact, Colbert also made a cameo in Spider-Man comics and the comedian's alter ego Tek Jansen got his comic book series. \nSince taking over \"The Late Show\" from David Letterman in September, Colbert has continued proudly beating the nerd drum: Beyond his Zelda-themed musical extravaganza, the comedian has hosted a cavalcade of high-profile tech industry guests, including Apple's Tim Cook, Uber's Travis Kalanick and (potential supervillain) Elon Musk.

In many ways, the leaders of today's major tech companies are the modern equivalents of Rockefellers or Fords. \nThat power has garnered public interest that borders on obsession: Tim Cook can cause an explosion of activity when he makes a surprise visit to an Apple Store. Nearly every idea that comes from Elon Musk gets treated with almost instant credibility, even if it's a proposal to shoot people around via gigantic vacuum tubes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T03:05:01.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
