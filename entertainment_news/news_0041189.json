I go to alcoholics and have them promise me they'll go home and continue drinking. Then I release them back into the wild to do just that.\nI'm an emergency physician at an urban hospital, and I see alcoholics every single shift, brought in by the ambulance \"found down\" — that is, found passed out in public places or belligerent on the streets.\nWhen these patients get to the ER, it's a remarkably underwhelming work-up. We remove their urine-soaked clothes, put them on our monitors and for the most part let them \"MTF\" — metabolize to freedom, which is to say they can leave when they can walk.\nWe'll survey for signs of trauma or injury and possibly do very basic lab tests to check for gross metabolic abnormalities, but more often we just give them some IV fluids and vitamins. When they're sober enough to make the bleary-eyed walk to the bathroom down the hall, I deem them stable for discharge and release them to whence they came.\nIt is undoubtedly one of the worst cases of \"patchwork\" health care that exists. Because while emergency medicine is by definition short-term care, we get to know our \"frequent fliers\" quite well — our noncompliant heart failure patients, gang members who just can't stop getting shot, our end-stage COPD patients who still smoke a pack a day, our sickle cell patients and yes, our addicts.\nSo the question arises, why do I as an emergency physician not do more to stop their disease, the same way I do for organic chronic disease? I do ask every alcoholic if he or she is ready to quit, as one of the central tenets of recovery is that the alcoholic has to want to quit. But 9 times out of 10, they tell me, \"Naw, doc, I'm cool,\" as they eye their water bottle at bedside that smells suspiciously like Everclear.\nWe're a nation of addicts Dennis Byrne If we weren't such a nation of addicts, maybe hordes of drug smugglers wouldn't crash our borders to feed our habit.\nMaybe drug cartels wouldn't terrorize Mexico and Central America — our gift to our southern neighbors.\nMaybe drunks wouldn't kill so many on our highways, or our health-care system...\nIf we weren't such a nation of addicts, maybe hordes of drug smugglers wouldn't crash our borders to feed our habit.\nMaybe drug cartels wouldn't terrorize Mexico and Central America — our gift to our southern neighbors.\nMaybe drunks wouldn't kill so many on our highways, or our health-care system...\n(Dennis Byrne) So what is an emergency physician to do, who still has the rest of the room full of patients to take care of? You do what you can and tell them they will die if they continue on, give them the stock printout of support resources that they inevitably leave behind with the dirty sheets and hope you don't see them again. If you want to go above and beyond, you can send the bright-eyed, bushy-tailed medical student or the bleeding-heart social worker in to give it their best shot also.\nA strange thing happens, however, after I receive some variation of the \"Naw, doc, I'm cool\" response: I ask them when they plan to have their next drink. I ask which liquor store they're going to go to, how long it's going to take for them to get there and if they have money in their pocket for it. Because alcohol withdrawal is just as, if not more so, dangerous than alcohol overdose itself. There are few withdrawals from substances that can kill, but alcohol is the foremost of them. So they tell me they have their daily fifth of vodka still at home, they show me the bus pass they will use to get there, and I let them go and continue my complicity with their disease.\nThere are apparent issues with this form of \"addiction medicine,\" but most of all a resource one: With the emergency room so often just the purgatory between drinks for alcoholics, few emergency departments are actually equipped to offer these addicts the help they need beyond their acute intoxication.\nMental health is notoriously underfunded, but addiction is an issue too expensive to continue ignoring. A study in the American Journal of Emergency Medicine cites $900 million annually in hospital charges from uncomplicated alcoholic intoxication (in lay terms, just drunk patients). The scarce psychiatric care in the emergency room is reserved for the already burgeoning group of patients who are a danger to themselves or society (with suicidal/homicidal thoughts or an inability to care for self). Rehab is inherently expensive and involves long waiting lists, so even if patients decide they would like to get help, they're still sent home for weeks or even months first. Inpatient admissions are already filled with \"placement\" barriers of chronically medically ill patients into facilities, and admission of medically uncomplicated alcoholics would be an inappropriate use of resources.\nGiven these limitations, the ER becomes a very expensive, often taxpayer-funded, drunk tank.\nPilot programs and innovations exist but are far from pervasive. \"Brief Motivational Interventions\" — fancy speak for \"lecture like your mother should have\" — have shown some gains in making headway with patients, although they require multiple encounters in the ER and the resources of overstretched case managers and social workers.\n\"Managed alcohol programs,\" which provide a controlled daily amount of alcohol to alcoholics in order to reduce harmful behavior, show limited success and get little political support. Limited resources have stymied intensive case-management programs.\nTraditional 12-step programs like Alcoholics Anonymous prevail throughout the country, but they require the patient to actually attend meetings after discharge. Community-based programs attempting to partner with hospitals for direct contact with alcoholic patients face significant legal and privacy barriers. Some cities have punitive \"serial inebriate\" programs that allow police to arrest serial drunks and charge them with misdemeanors.\nIn an era of tight budgets, few legislators seem motivated to allocate resources for the difficult problems of alcoholism and mental health. Until that changes, it is the physicians who are stuck offering only short-term patches for addicts. We let them go on to their next drink, fully expecting to see them again.\nAmy Ho is a Chicago physician.\n Hospitals and Clinics Healthcare Providers Crime Opinion Commentary", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5616ba56/turbine/ct-er-alcohol-addiction-doctors-health-care-perspec-1009-jm-20151008", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54cfa5cf/turbine/ct-institute-of-drug-abuse-gallup-0203-20150202"], "published": "2015-10-08T21:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:50:23.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
