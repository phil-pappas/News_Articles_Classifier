On the Sunday before its final episode, PBS will air a marathon of the season up to that point and a behind-the-scenes program on how the show was made. \nThe network will also try to use “Downton Abbey” as a launching pad for “Mercy Street,” a Civil War drama premiering Jan. 17 directly after an episode of the outgoing hit. \nPBS also has a new two-part Ken Burns documentary on Jackie Robinson that will premiere in April to coincide with the start of a new baseball season.
