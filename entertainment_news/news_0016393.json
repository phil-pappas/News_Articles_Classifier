Reid, PhD., is both fascinating and educational; this work narrates the experiences and lives of working women when the men were at war.\n(PRWEB) October 19, 2015\nJeanette B. Reid, PhD., a retired Psychotherapist, Scotland native, immigrant, history buff, researcher, devoted writer and author, has completed her newest work “Women Warrior of WWII”: a gripping and potent historical work that depicts the hardships, passions and struggles of working women during the war.\n\"Some historians like to think that the British were very fortunate when Hitler grew impatient with his attempt to run over the British Isles, becoming distracted, then moving his attention to the Russian Front. I take a different perspective. Hitler found that it was much tougher to defeat the British people than he or any of his top aides ever imagined. We had many losses in our military and civilian population, but we were able to call upon every available man to fight on the frontline because we had a secret weapon at home keeping the country surviving - Our Women,” said author Jeanette B. Reid, PhD.\nPublished by New York City-based Page Publishing, Jeanette B. Reid’s poignant tale delves into the ideas of survival, love, loss and happiness.\nIts 1939 - war is imminent for the people of Britain. It is becoming increasingly clear that every able bodied man will be needed on the battlefront and that British women will have to take over the jobs the men left for military service. This is the narrative of Scottish women in particular - through their stories, experiences, and sacrifices - how they not only kept Scotland and Britain alive but helped change the course of history.\nReaders who wish to experience this profound work can purchase “Women Warrior of WWII” at bookstores everywhere or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708.\nAbout Page Publishing\nPage Publishing is a traditional New York based full-service publishing house that handles all of the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
