The mind-set becomes, ‘Us against them,’” Remini said. “The decision to leave is you are giving up everything you have ever known and everything you have worked for your whole life.” \nThe actress also details her 30-year association with the Church in her new memoir, Troublemaker: Surviving Hollywood and Scientology . \n“I feel that people need to understand this has been my whole life,” Remini said. “I want them to understand how it happens.” \nWatch the exclusive ABC News interview with Leah Remini on 20/20 this Friday at 10 p.m. ET. \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
