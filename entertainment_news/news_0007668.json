Letting go and letting God. \nThat night as I worried and stewed about \"the problem\" I felt called to insert the name of a loved one in the Serenity Prayer. \"God grant (and I filled in her name) the serenity to accept the things she cannot change, the courage to change the things she can, and the wisdom to know the difference. Help her to live one day at a time, to enjoy one moment at a time, to accept these current difficulties and hardships as her pathway to peace of mind, body, and spirit. Help her to accept this sinful world as it is, not as she would have it, so she can trust that you will make all things right as she learns to surrender her will to you, so that in time she may become reasonably happy in this life and supremely happy with you in the next.\" kAm!C2J:?8 E9@D6 H@C5D 3C@F89E 324< 2 >6>@CJ @7 G:D:E:?8 2 A2DE@C 7C:6?5 H96? x H2D 6>3C@:=65 :? 2 5:77:4F=E H@C< C6=2E:@?D9:A] w6 E@=5 >6 E@ AC2J x r@C `b 3J :?;64E:?8 E9:D >2?VD ?2>6] Q{@G6 :D A2E:6?E 2?5 <:?5 H:E9]]]] {@G6 :D D=@H E@ =@D6 2?86C H:E9]]]Q H9:49 @?46 282:?
