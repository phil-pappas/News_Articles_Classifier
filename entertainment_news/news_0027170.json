(AP Photo/Patrick Sison) \nNEW YORK (AP) -- Academy Award-winning filmmaker Quentin Tarantino has joined hundreds of people rallying and marching through the streets of New York City to protest police brutality. \nThe group rallied Saturday in Manhattan's Washington Square Park before marching about 2 miles along Sixth Avenue. \nSpeakers at the protest say they want to bring justice for people killed by police. Tarantino flew in from California to march alongside academic Cornel West at the RiseUpOctober event. \nNo arrests have been reported. \nThe protest comes days after a police officer was fatally shot while chasing a theft suspect. The suspect has been charged with murder and robbery. His lawyer says there are missing details in the case. \nThe police commissioner and the mayor have said they're serious about enacting smart reforms to build trust between police and communities. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press.
