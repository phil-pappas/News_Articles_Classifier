One woman was a cocktail server at a jazz club in Redondo Beach, California, in the 1970s. She accused Cosby of stealing her panties after drugging her and assaulting her in her car while she was unconscious. Another was a former model and actress who appeared as an extra on \"The Cosby Show.\" She said Cosby told her she'd better sleep with him if she wanted to make it in the entertainment industry. After years of silence, the women said, allegations against Cosby from other women emboldened them to come forward. \"After 35 years of living with these shameful memories in secret, I was finally encouraged by all the other women who have recently told their stories,\" said Sharon Van Ert, the former waitress. Accusations from more than 40 women More than 40 women have publicly accused Cosby of sexual misconduct over the past 40 years. The comedian has never been criminally charged and has vehemently denied wrongdoing. Cosby's representatives declined to comment on the latest claims. 26 photos: Who are Cosby's accusers? 26 photos: Who are Cosby's accusers?

Janice Dickinson alleged she and Cosby had dinner in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, in 1982 and he gave her a glass of red wine and a pill she believed was for menstrual cramps. \"The last thing I remember was Bill Cosby in a patchwork robe, dropping his robe and getting on top of me. And I remember a lot of pain,\" she told \"Entertainment Tonight.\" Cosby's attorney said in a statement that Dickinson's allegation was a \"fabricated lie\" that contradicted what she wrote in her autobiography and what she said during a 2002 New York Observer interview.

Linda Joy Traitz said Cosby offered her a ride home while she was working as a waitress at a restaurant in Los Angeles that he co-owned in 1969. On the way, they detoured to the beach. They parked and he offered her drugs \"to relax,\" she alleged. After refusing \"he kept offering me the pills,\" she alleged, and it made her feel uncomfortable. She claimed he then groped her chest, pushing her down in the seat and toward the door, and tried to lie on top of her. She got out of the car and ran, she said. She added that she was \"absolutely not\" raped. He tried to calm her, she said, then drove her home in silence. Traitz has a criminal record in Florida and spent time in prison on a conviction for drug trafficking, according to state records. Cosby's lawyer passed on her lengthy rap sheet. Traitz spoke openly about her record to CNN. Hide Caption 9 of 26 26 photos: Who are Cosby's accusers? Playboy bunny Victoria Valentino said her friend Francesca Emerson first introduced her to Cosby hoping to help her get work on his show \"I Spy\" in the late '60s. Valentino said after an interview in his trailer, Cosby invited her and a different friend to dinner, where they drank red wine and Cosby offered her pills to \"cheer up,\" she said. She said she felt \"stoned,\" slurring her words. They then went with him to what she described as a \"ballers pad,\" an office-like space in an apartment building, with two loveseats and no working phone. Valentino said she was feeling \"totally out of it\" when she saw Cosby attempting to advance on her passed-out friend. She said she began reaching out to Cosby to pull him off her friend when he pushed her down, first pushing himself near her mouth, before turning her around and raping her.

Cosby's attorney didn't immediately return a CNN call for comment on Johnson's allegation, which she first made in a Vanity Fair article. Hide Caption 11 of 26 26 photos: Who are Cosby's accusers?

Green further detailed her allegations in a defamation lawsuit against Cosby filed in December. Hide Caption 12 of 26 26 photos: Who are Cosby's accusers?

The alleged sexual assault took place in 1974 when Huth was 15 years old. According to court documents, Huth and a 16-year-old friend met with Cosby and eventually went to the Playboy Mansion with him. \"He then proceeded to sexually molest her by attempting to put his hand down her pants and then taking her hand in his hand and performing a sex act on himself without her consent,\" according to the documents. Cosby's lawyer said Huth's claims are \"absolutely false\" and he accused her of engaging in extortion after Cosby rejected her \"outrageous demand for money in order not to make her allegations public.\" Hide Caption 13 of 26 26 photos: Who are Cosby's accusers?

He was lying next to me, and I slithered out of the bed, my clothes all over the floor. ... I got myself together, I went downstairs, I got in a cab and I went home.\" Masten recalled \"hurting really bad.\" As to why, she alleged: \"There were bruise marks all over me.

In a statement released through lawyer Gloria Allred's office, Helen Hayes alleged that Cosby followed her and two friends \"around all day\" at a summer 1973 celebrity tennis tournament in Pebble Beach, California, hosted by actor Clint Eastwood. Hayes claimed she and her friends tried to avoid Cosby, but he caught up with them in a restaurant, \"approached me from behind and reached over my shoulder and grabbed my right breast.\" \"I was stunned and angry, because he had no right to do that and I did not know why he would behave that way,\" Hayes said. \"His behavior was like that of a predator.\" Hide Caption 15 of 26 26 photos: Who are Cosby's accusers?

A short time later, her agent got a call that Cosby wanted to meet with her. In a statement, Gumpel said that, after Cosby hugged and kissed her in front of onlookers at a New York studio, she was asked back to his dressing room. There, she found Cosby \"wearing a loosely tied robe\" and then -- with the robe still on -- he put \"his crotch area in my face,\" Gumpel alleged. The comedian touched her shoulders then tried repeatedly to get Gumpel to have a drink he'd made, she said. After her refusals, Gumpel said, \"Cosby turned his back to me and walked to the door. Cosby looked at me and his face clouded up, as if he was frustrated and angry, and he told me to leave.\" Hide Caption 23 of 26 26 photos: Who are Cosby's accusers?

Why was my bra unhooked?'\" The two later conducted an \"on-and-off consensual affair\" that lasted several years, she alleged to People magazine. \"He kept luring me in,\" Ferrier told the magazine. \"I felt like I couldn't say no.\" At the time, Cosby's publicist told People he had no comment.

She later woke up to find her bra undone and her clothes in disarray, she further alleged to police in her home province of Ontario, Canada, in January 2005. Cosby settled a civil suit with Constand that alleged 13 Jane Does had similar stories of sexual abuse. Hide Caption 25 of 26 26 photos: Who are Cosby's accusers? Chloe Goins told the Los Angeles Police Department on January 14 that Cosby sexually assaulted her in 2008 during a party at the Playboy Mansion, when she was 18. Spencer Kuvin, Goins' attorney, said his client may be the first accuser to have a case that falls within the statute of limitations for bringing criminal charges. Cobsy's lawyer, Martin Singer, denied the accusation and said the comedian was not in California on August 8, 2008, the night of the \"Midsummer Night's Party.\" Hide Caption 26 of 26 The latest allegations come amid news this week that three universities -- Marquette, Fordham and Brown -- stripped Cosby of honorary degrees . \"Mr. Cosby has nobody to blame but himself for his choices and his actions,\" the women's lawyer, Gloria Allred, said Wednesday in her Los Angeles law office. \"There should be serious consequences for anyone who intentionally harms or endangers the health, safety or life of innocent women and girls.\" 'Everything became a blur' Pamela Abeyta said she kept her story to herself for more than three decades because she felt that she was to blame. Pamela Abeyta \"I believed that it was my fault for putting myself in that position,\" she saidWednesday. \"It took me many months to come forward because of the shame it might cause my family, but then I realized I am the victim and how much this has bothered me all of these years.\" Abeyta was 25 when she met Cosby's producer in 1979 through a friend. She said she met him at an Orange County residence, hoping \"it might lead to an opportunity with Playboy\" because Cosby knew Hugh Hefner. During the meeting, the producer called Cosby and said they would be on the \"next flight to Las Vegas,\" she said. Abeyta and the producer met Cosby in a dressing room at the Las Vegas Hilton after he finished a show, she said. Cosby brought her to the Elvis Presley suite in the hotel and showed her to her own room, she said. They went downstairs, and he gave her $200 to spend on gambling while he mingled with others. She went back to the suite about 1 a.m. After she awoke the next day, Cosby told her to buy an evening gown for the \"champagne dinner\" during his show. She spent $2,500 on clothing, shoes and a clutch bag for the event, charging it to his room, she said. At the show, she remembers having food and drinks before blacking out. \"Everything became a blur,\" she said. \"I believe that someone put something in my drink.\" She remembers waking up twice in Cosby's bed and seeing him once before allegedlyblacking out again. She woke up the next day in her own room in the suite and left soon after, she said. \"I got up and left the hotel the next morning, not even knowing what went on through the night. I barely remember how I got to the airport or even how I got home. I know I flew home, but it was all in a fog,\" she said. 'You owe me' Former model and actress Lisa Christie said she was 18 when she met Cosby on the set of \"The Cosby Show.\" He chose her out of a line of models and took an interest in her career, paying for her to attend theater classes at Buffalo State College, including transportation costs from New York to Buffalo, she said. Lisa Christie The relationship lasted about two years, from 1987 to 1989, before he tried to pressure her into sex in a hotel room, she alleged. At the time, she says, she considered him a \"father figure.\" Now, she believes he \"waited\" for her because he knew she was a virgin. After college, she says she was offered a co-host position for an NBC affiliate show called \"Wedding Magazine.\" Cosby flew her to Chicago to see whether she should pursue a career as a television actor. He also told her he wanted her to audition for his film \"Ghost Dad.\" Under the pretense of an \"acting exercise,\" Cosby told her to close her eyes before leaning in to kiss her \"like a boyfriend,\" she said. When she resisted, he told her \"you owe me,\" she said. When she rebuffed his advances, he retreated to his room, telling her: \"This is your last chance. If you want to make it in this business, you have to sleep with me.\" Christie apparently described the ordeal in a book she released last year -- but did not name Cosby. She read from the book at the news conference. In that passage, Christie describes an incident with a man who propositioned her. She wrote that the man's son died a week later. Cosby's son died in 1997. But at the news conference, she said Cosby propositioned her in the late 1980s. Allred said the book had a mistake, which she blamed on clumsy editing that will be corrected. \"I was one of the fortunate ones. Now I'm here to support all the victims,\" Christie said. Cosby accuser in July: 'At last we are being validated' 'Mr. Cosby started getting fresh' Sharon Van Ert was a cocktail server at Concerts by the Sea, a jazz club in Redondo Beach, when she met Cosby. Sharon Van Ert One night after a few drinks with co-workers and customers post-closing time, she said, Cosby walked her to her car. She remembers feeling dizzy as she got into the car and Cosby asked if she was capable of driving home. She got in the driver's seat to regain composure, she said, and Cosby got in the passenger's seat. \"After a while, Mr. Cosby started getting fresh. He was touching me and rubbing my leg. The next thing I remember was waking up in my car, my head hanging down from the seat, alone,\" she said in between tears. \"I knew I was drugged because I threw up, and I never threw up or drank too much. I believe that he must have put something in my drink while we were closing up the place.\" When she got home, she realized she was missing her panties. \"I believe that Mr. Cosby took them after he assaulted me.\" July: Cosby accuser talks to CNN Fallout continues The fallout from the controversy over the sex assault allegations against Cosby has been swift. Reruns of \"The Cosby Show,\" his landmark 1980s sitcom, have been pulled from the airwaves, and other projects and tour dates have been scrapped. Allred noted Wednesday that statute of limitations prevents Cosby from facing criminal charges. But a California judge ordered Cosby in August to give a sworn deposition in a civil suit alleging he sexually abused a teenage girl more than 40 years ago. Cosby is scheduled to answer questions under oath from the accuser's legal team on October 9.
