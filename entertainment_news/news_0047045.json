In fact, mentally ill people are far likelier to be the victims of violence rather than the perpetrators.\" \nOliver said that mental illness deserves to be part of the national conversation, though, because our mental healthcare system is need of major reforms. \n\"It is a clusterfuck, except that's an insult to clusterfucks,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T12:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:23:21.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
