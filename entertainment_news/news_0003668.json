She said that Salman’s “Bajrangi Bhaijaan” should be dubbed into sign language so that she and a large number of people like her would be able to watch and understand the movie, especially its songs and dialogues in a better way,” Head of the help centre and sign language interpreter Gyanendra Purohit told PTI here today. (Also Read: Geeta, deaf-mute girl stranded in Pakistan, denies she is married) \nDirected by Kabir Khan, “Bajrangi Bhaijaan” is about a little Pakistani girl who loses her way on the Indo-Pak border and finds herself in India. The character played by Salman finds the girl and takes it upon himself to re-unite her with her family in Pakistan.Purohit said he has been in touch with the External Affairs Ministry for the last three months on the issue of Geeta’s return to India from Karachi.”On the request of Geeta, we are going to dub “Bajrangi Bhaijaan” film into a sign language. We wish that once it is completed and exhibited for the first time, both Salman and Geeta should remain present on the occasion,” Purohit said.He said that Geeta is a big fan of Salman and during the recent interaction, she expressed her desire to meet the Bollywood star along with her family members. \n“Geeta has a special place for Salman in her heart. Her story is almost similar to the screenplay of “Bajrangi Bhaijaan” which was a huge success in the country,” he added.Geeta is likely to return to India by October 26 as the Centre has completed all formalities for her return to the country. According to Purohit, in the past, famous films like Sholay (1975), Gandhi (1982), Munnabhai MBBS (2003) and Tare Zameen Par (2007), had been dubbed into sign language.”This was not done with any commercial interest and it was done only for the benefit of special persons,” he said. \nModified Date: October 19, 2015 11:11 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:40:40.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
