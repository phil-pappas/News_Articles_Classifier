They progressed to playing alongside some of the finest names in Ska and Reggae including The Skatalites, Toots and The Maytals, Ziggy Marley, Jimmy Cliff, UB40 and Madness. \nWith a number of album releases, several top 40 chart singles, a record breaking seven sell out shows at indigo at the 02 and an ever increasing large worldwide fan base behind them their success has continued. Now heralded as the UKâ€™s finest Ska & Reggae band, The Dualers continue to play to sell-out crowds all over the UK, Europe & Asia. \n2015 sees the band taking their upbeat energetic show all over the UK and the upcoming performance at Talking Heads in Southampton on Saturday will be something of a homecoming for two members of the band.
