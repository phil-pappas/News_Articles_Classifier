The one question which came to my mind was why couldn't the police do a proper investigation right from the beginning? Had they conducted the investigation properly, the case would have been solved. - Muktesh Chander, special commissioner of police (Traffic), Delhi\nREAD: Talvar Movie Review\nNo forensic team reached ground zero!\n#IDidn'tKnowThis\nI had heard about how the police was lackadaisical with the investigation but I didn't know that no forensic team or sniffer dogs reached ground zero when the news broke. Also, I was clueless that there were ego clashes between the heads of the two subsequent investigation teams. - Shibani Kashyap, singer\nOn what basis were the Talwars sent to jail?\n#IWantToKnowThis\nWe heard that the case had trial by media. So my first question is, did the media really have a role to play in what the verdict was? Is it possible for the media, no matter how extensive the coverage, to influence the judiciary? As the film shows, there wasn't any conclusive evidence to nail the culprits. My second question is, in such a case, on what basis were the Talwars sent to jail? - Nila Madhab Panda, filmmaker\nThe chronology of the botched up investigation\n#IWantToSee\nI haven't seen the film yet but I am going to. One thing I look forward to finding out from the film is the the chronology of the botched up investigation. Everybody said it was botched up, but I feel the answers we're looking for would be in the chronology. It was never discussed, serialized, documented.- Vani Tripathi, CBFC board member.\nFor the latest Bollywood updates follow us on Twitter >>> @TOIEntertain\nFor the latest in Bollywood news, like us on Facebook >>> TOIEntertain\nFor more interesting Bollywood news and pictures follow us on Pinterest>>> timesofindia\nFor latest Bollywood updates follow us on G+ >>> The Times of India Entertainment\nListen to Talvar songs on Gaana.com\nWATCH: Everything you need to know about 'Talvar'-TOI\nPiku Amazon.in : INR 340.00 Buy now ", "external_links": ["http://gaana.com/album/talvar", "https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/tb08G7YdyJs", "https://www.pinterest.com/timesofindia/", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107628521107103264647/+TOIEntertainment/posts", "https://twitter.com/TOIEntertain", "http://www.amazon.in/Piku-Amitabh-Bachchan/dp/B010SDQ98K%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJP4GPDYQHXPFUOWQ%26tag%3Dtimofind-21%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB010SDQ98K", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cx6gmVjuL._SL160_.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T05:57:05.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
