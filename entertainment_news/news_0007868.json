Under his leadership, the publication was viewed as an independent voice, often critical of the state. \n“Culture, as we saw it, wasn’t about the movements of intellectuals and the activities of the Ministry of Culture bodies, but about society in general. We were able to publish what none of the state-owned newspapers were able to share,” el-Ghitani said in a 2012 video interview with Ahram Online. \nHe was an outspoken critic of the Muslim Brotherhood and supported the military’s overthrow of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi in 2013. \nEgypt’s presidency issued statements praising el-Ghitani following his death, calling him a“symbol to Arab writers who mobilize their pens for the service of their homeland and their people.” \n“We mourn the pioneer of pioneers of the Arabic novel, the guard of guards of nationalist culture, a warrior in the field of war literature, a correspondent and soldier on the battlefront wielding his pen as a weapon, and one of the first military correspondents,” the armed forces were quoted as saying by MENA. \nEl-Ghitani won the Nile Award, Egypt’s highest state honor, in 2015. \nState media reported that hundreds of people attended his funeral Sunday afternoon at Sayida Nafisa Mosque in Cairo. \nHe is survived by his wife Magda el-Gindi and his son Mohammed. \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to show the wife’s name is Magda, not Mervat.
