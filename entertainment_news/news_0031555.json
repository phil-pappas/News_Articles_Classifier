Sunday Night reporter Rahni Sadler describes the swim that changed her mind about sharks October 11, 2015 4:42pm On Sunday Night: Rahni Sadler swims with sharks 0:17 \nCourtesy: Channel Seven. \nIF ANYONE had told me that one day I’d be underwater watching a huge tiger shark swim so close I could touch it, I’d have called them mad. \nI’m terrified of sharks, absolutely, utterly terrified. \nAlways have been, like anyone who has ever seen Jaws . \nAs a long time ocean swimmer and surfer, I’ve spent inordinate hours thinking of strategies to avoid sharks and how I would respond if my Mick Fanning moment ever came. \nSo embarking on a trip where we’d deliberately come face to face with sharks, some of the most dangerous in the world, would not long ago have seemed beyond ludicrous. \nIt started out as research for a story on the awful attacks that have been taking place on the north coast of New South Wales. I set about reading everything I could on shark behaviour and the potential causes of attacks. \nThere is a lot of brilliant research out there, conducted over many years by leading marine biologists. Rahni Sadler got up close to a shark in her report that airs on Sunday Night tonight on Seven. Source: Channel 7 \nTheir findings can be summarised like this: humans are not a part of any large predatory shark’s diet, the vast majority of bites are a case of mistaken identity and far from stalking humans, sharks would rather steer clear of us. Sharks are there every time we go in the water, if they wanted to attack us they would, but in the overwhelming majority of cases, they don’t. \nIt was faith in this research that led us to the Bahamas, where there is a shark sanctuary almost the size of New South Wales. \nAll sharks are protected and experienced divers lead groups keen to observe sharks in their natural environment. You dive outside a cage, without spear guns, with sharks which have not been fed or drugged. \nOn a dive boat, we travelled from West Palm Beach, Florida to a place known as “Tiger Beach”, forty kilometres off the coast of the Bahamas. \nOn the way over, I wasn’t sure I’d have the nerve to go through with it. What gave me confidence was the extensive safety training we did before the dive. \nI was told each shark dive encounter could be fatal, and if it was, the main reason would be human error. If I took careful note of the safety instruction, and adhered to it closely, there would be every opportunity for a safe interaction. \nThe most important rule is not to panic. If you panic and try to suddenly swim to the surface, you look like prey. This is not a situation Rahni Sadler ever thought she’d be in. Source: Channel 7 \nLet me tell you, it took weeks of mental training, and by that I mean chanting “Don’t flee” a thousand times a day, to prepare me for this encounter. \nSharks are essentially curious but it was vital we didn’t spark their primal hunting instincts. First we were ordered to dress in dark dull colours, covering all flesh and hair. Bright colours and pale skin could appear to a shark like fish they want to eat. \nAs I moved towards the boat’s back deck, there were at least thirty sharks that I could see. \nThey were Caribbean Reef Sharks, Lemon Sharks and Nurse sharks, all of which can attack humans, but rarely do. Down below, lurking in the shadows, were the Tiger Sharks, the world’s second deadliest, after the Great White. \nOn the back of the boat is a ledge, level with the water. You have to lay down an slide into the water without splashing. On the surface, you are at your most vulnerable. \nFrom the boat there’s a rope leading down to the ocean floor 12 metres below. You have to swim down slowly and smoothly, surrounded by Caribbean, Lemon and Nurse sharks. \nIn the clear, calm waters of the Bahamas, it’s very easy for the sharks to make out what we are. \nThey are lured to the area by the scent of dead fish crammed into a crate our hosts have brought with them. Sharks as big as three metres swim all around us, so close you can touch them. \nThese sharks seem oblivious to us. It’s another shark that commands their attention. A close encounter of the shark kind. Source: Channel 7 \nOn our third dive, not long after we swam down the rope, a Tiger Shark arrived. It was immediately obvious that all the other sharks bowed down to this almighty creature. She was about four metres long, and probably weighed four hundred kilograms. She moved slowly but with confidence. \nTigers Sharks are assault predators, they lurk in the distance before coming in for attack. They attack from behind. The number one rule is to have eyes in every direction and we have four safety divers looking around constantly. \nOur divers can spot the shadow of a tiger from an incredible distance. Not only do tigers swim differently from the other sharks, they are longer, have stunningly broad girth and of course the stripes that earn them their name. \nShe circled repeatedly. Each time her black eye would dart around, looking directly into yours as she swam by. Instead of fear, I was in awe. I was struck by how beautiful she was. My brain was working overtime remembering all the safety training, and going through everything I had to watch and do. \nShe had every opportunity to attack and over half an hour with us made no attempt whatsoever. \nI made it back to the boat with all my limbs intact and a whole new view on sharks. \nI no longer think of them as mindless man eaters that stalk and hunt humans as prey. They are not harmless, but it is us who are entering their world. \nMaybe we need to find better ways to adapt human behaviour so that sharks and humans can coexist safely. \nRahni’s special report airs tonight on Sunday Night at 7pm on Seven.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T09:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:35:30.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
