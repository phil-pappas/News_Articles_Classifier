(AP Photo/Francisco Seco) Sponsored Links The Associated Press MADRID â€” \nA composer says he is asking Spain's parliament to back his proposal to set words to the lyric-free national anthem. \nMadrid musician Victor Lago says he has submitted his lyrics to the lower house and also launched a campaign to collect the 500,000 signatures needed to enable lawmakers to debate his proposal. \nSpain's wordless national anthem has often caused consternation among onlookers from other nations at international events like soccer matches and Olympics because all Spaniards can do is hum along to its tune. \nA previous attempt to set words to the march-like tune, organized by the Spanish Olympic Committee, flopped in 2008 when the lyrics put forward were deemed too politically-charged. \nLago says his lyrics are neutral and inspired solely by his love for Spain and Spaniards.
