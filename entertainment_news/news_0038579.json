It reminded me of other post industrialization movements that provided an outlet for our age old, human drive to create and then somehow affiliate. But the Maker Movement is not just a fad for friends to get together like my grandmother’s china painting club. It is not an isolated, rural space, with little modernity, to practice traditional crafts like some of the guilds that arose in the mid-20th century.\nThe Maker Movement seems to embrace the past, but it is really grounded in the present and also forward looking. It’s eclectic and inclusive. The Maker Movement is as welcoming to craftsmen such as traditional wood and metal workers as it is to chocolatiers, animators, robotic engineers, dancers, and the archetypal tinker.\nThe Maker Movement also provides a virtual space, support group, and the motivation for makers to explore and utilize cutting edge technologies, to innovate. The Faire’s provide physical spaces for makers to exhibit, demonstrate, market, collaborate, share information, inspire and get inspired. This growing movement, which officially began in California, has become an international phenomenon.\nSince 2006, when MAKE magazine produced the first Maker Faire in San Mateo, California, the event has grown to more than 1,100 Makers and 130,000 attendees in 2014. And the number of Faire’s has exploded.\nAfter it was first presented 4 years ago, another flagship event, the World Maker Faire in New York City, has grown to include more than 600 Makers and 80,000 attendees.\nThere are now Maker Faire’s in Detroit, Kansas City, Atlanta, Milwaukee, Orlando and Silver Springs, MD in the United States as well as international Maker Faire events in Paris, Rome, Oslo, Trondheim, Tokyo, Newcastle (UK), and Shenzhen, China.\nThere are over 120 community-driven Mini Maker Faire’s, such as the one in Rochester, in cities across the country and world-wide.\nThe official description. What is a Maker Faire?\nAs is stated on the Rochester Mini Maker Faire website, “Maker Faire is the Greatest Show (and Tell) on earth – a family friendly showcase of invention, creativity, resourcesfulness and a celebration of the Maker Movement. It’s a place where people show what they are making, and share what they are learning…The aim of Maker Faire is to entertain, inform, connect and grow this community.”\nBecome a part of the local Maker Community at the Rochester Mini Maker Faire\nThe 2nd annual Rochester Mini Maker Faire will be held on Saturday, November 21, from 9 am to 5 pm, at the Rochester Riverside Convention Center.

Organizers hope to attract between 2,500 and 3,000 adults, children, families, schools and Makers to attend in year 2.\nWith many more to be added to the roster, the Rochester Mini Maker Faire 2015 has confirmed 29 exhibitors to date, which include Rochester Brainery , Airigami , Rochester Amateur Radio Association, Rochester Museum Science Center , and Rochester Lego User Group .
