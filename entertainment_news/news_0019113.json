The class teaches single fathers how to care for their daughters’ hair.\n\"I think it's a service to the community, and it is important to do our part,\" Morgese told ABC News .\nDuring the first class, the 33-year-old father taught seven other dads \"very basic detangling, brushing, ponytails, three strand braids and a standard bun.\" He even gave out goody bags with hair care products.\n“I’m not a professional, but I had the best intentions, and I was sure I could help,” Morgese said. “Most of the dads picked it right up and did some outstanding stuff,” he added.\nMorgese plans to offer the class weekly or bi-weekly.\n“The bond between a parent and their child is special. I hope this story inspires others to volunteer their time to help those in their community,\" he said.\nThe first class was a success! 7 dads and daughters showed up top learn about hair. The commitment these fathers have is admirable. I'm so proud of you guys.\nPosted by Daddy Daughter Hair Factory on Tuesday, October 6, 2015\nHere are some pictures of hair I have done the last year or so.
