June 9th 2015 4 months ago /video/video.news.com.au/Entertainment/ \nJESSICA Chastain reveals her “Martian” salary was much lower than it was originally reported to be. \n“Someone wrote an article once that said I made a certain amount of money for The Martian ,” she said on Huff Post Live . \n“I made less than a quarter of that in reality.” \nAlthough she didn’t specify which outlet incorrectly wrote about her paycheck, Star Magazine reported in June that Chastain earned $9.6 million AUD for her role as Melissa Lewis in The Martian , while star Matt Damon was reported to have earned $34.4 million for his role. \nLess than a quarter of that figure would mean the actress — who plays a large role in the movie, though not even close to that of Damon — earned roughly $2.4 for her work on the drama. \n“For me, listen, it’s wonderful that people are starting to talk about the wage gap and really that it’s an issue,” she said.
