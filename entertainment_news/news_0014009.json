WALTER, THOMPSON/AP Thomas Alva Edison, who developed the first electric light bulb, is shown in his laboratory in West Orange, N.J. (Originally published by the Daily News on October, 19, 1931.)\nThomas A. Edison perfected his first invention to save himself work. He was 16, and a telegraph operator. Every hour he was required to send a signal over the line to show his wire chief that he was awake and on the job.\nIt was 1863, the second year of the Civil War. The telegraph was cruder then.\nEdison devised a wheel with notches in the rim and set it to revolving so that every hour the notches set out his signals for him. The deception was discovered, but the invention was the forerunner of the modern messenger boy call box.\nGrandfather of Radio.\nEdison's brain was more productive of useful mechanical and electrical things than any single genius of the present and past generation. But his forte was the synthesis of scientific phenomena, rather than their discovery. Although he was the first to observe the so-called Edison Effect, which is the principle employed in all radio tubes, he did not turn it to use. DeForest performed that function for posterity.\nBorn in 1847, he was 10 when he began experimenting in a homemade laboratory; 13 when he published his first weekly newspaper with a circulation of 400, and 15 when he became a telegraph operator. During his long and brilliant career he obtained 1,200 patents.\nHighlights in his development, subsequent to 1863, follow:\n1865 - Invented the repeater, which automatically picks up feeble message at the end of a long line and relays the impulses along.\n1865 - Edison, 21, obtained his first patent. It was on an electric machine to record automatically the votes in Congress. It was a financial failure.\n1869 - Invented improved stock market ticker after accidentally being called in to repair one of old design. Got $5,000 for patent, and proceeded to make three improveents netting additional $35,000. With capital set up laboratory in Newark, N.J.\nNew York Daily News Cover of the New York Daily News on October 19, 1931. New York Daily News New York Daily News article on Thomas Edison in 1931.

He now had made approximately $400,000 from his inventions and manufacture thereof.\nPhonograph and Lamp.\n1877 - The phonograph, or talking machine, first of the inventions which stamped him, at 30 years old, the wizard of the mechanical age, was invented, although it was not perfected until 1890.\n1879 - The incandescent lamp, for which he is perhaps most famed, was discovered. This period, incidentally, also produced from Edison's mind the microtosimeter for measuring the smallest changes in temperature, and the megaphone.\n1880 - The electric dynamo, and a process for preserving fruit.\nDaily News President Calvin Coolidge looks on as Thomas Edison works his movie camera. 1881 - Edison, 34, had a mass of new ideas this year. The electric motor, the electric locomotive, regulators for dynamos, an underground conductor for electricity, electric meters and an ore separator were the most notable.\n1882 - The turntable for electric railways, translation of electric currents from high to low tension, shafting and the valve gear were perfected.\n1883 - Edison discovered the \"Edison Effect\" - that an incandescent filament in a vacuum tube throws atoms into space. The inventor noticed, as his electric lights grew older, their glass bulbs became black on the inside. He deduced that the discoloration was produced by atoms from the filament. De Forest harnessed these flying atoms; made them carry currents, and thus produced the udion, or so-called vacuum tube.\nGold From Sulphate Ores.\n1885 - He perfected a railway signal system.\n1887 - A process for making plate glass.\n1888 - Method of extracting gold from sulphate ores.\n1889 - Toys occupied the attention of Edison, 42. He invented the phonographic doll and the sleeping doll, which closed its eyes.\n1891 - The first motion picture camera was produced by Edison at the age of 44, known as the kinetographic camera. He had been working on the idea for two years. He failed, however, to foresee the marvelous future of the movies.\n1899 - Apparatus for duplicating phonograph records, and system for reheating compressed air for industrial uses.\nJohn F.

He also made several improvements in storage batteries.\n1905 - The recording telephone.\n1906 - Interested in aviation, Edison was convinced that the success of heavier than air machines depended on light motors and reduction of fuel weight. He attempted to perfect a new type engine dependent on the explosive power of a ticker tape soaked in dynamite. An accident, resulting in the death of a helper, caused him to give up this project.\n1907 - Invented new phonographic recording and reproducing machines, a process for artificially aging Portland cement.\n1908 - Process for utilizing waste heat in kilns.\n1909 - Ten patents for the improvement of the phonograph.\nDaily News Thomas A.

He devised a method of synchronising motion pictures with phonographic records, but, due to mechanical difficulties, was not able to obtain satisfactory results. He became discouraged when the public failed to show interest.\n1916 - Three patents for projectiles, and a tube filling machine.\n1917 - Apparatus for producing cement structures.\n1918 - An improved transmitter.\n1923 - Unbreakable disc phonograph records, and a centrifugal speed governor.\n1924 - Six improvements in the telegraph.\n1925 - A new method for producing sound-record tablets.\n1926 - Improvements in the receiving apparatus of radio sets.\nHis fame as an inventive wizard led to many curious reports - the most extraordinary, perhaps, was a hoax perpetrated by himself, that he was trying to invent a machine to communicate with the spirits of the dead.\nTags: archives", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T19:09:50.641+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
