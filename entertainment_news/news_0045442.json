The movie, Singh's debut feature, is about a man who is obsessed with success until he sets on a journey to find his true fate through music.\nCo-producer Shaan Vyas described the work as \"a mainstream film in Bollywood with songs but without the cliches.\"\nExecutive programmer Kim Jiseok said the festival's organizers selected the Bollywood film hoping it would allow the audience to reflect on what South Korean society may have lost in its pursuit of wealth and success.\nThis year, a veteran South Korean actor and an Afghanistan actress shared the hosting of the opening ceremony.\nSong Kang-ho, the star of \"Snowpiercer,\" and Marina Golbarhari, who returned to Busan for the first time since her 2003 role in \"Osama,\" shared the spotlight on stage.\nThe festival also celebrates the rich tradition of Asian cinema and the region's growing clout in the global film industry.\nPrestigious Japanese animator Studio Ghibli received the 2015 Asian Filmmaker of the Year Award for its contribution to the development of the Asian film industry and Asian culture.\nWieland Speck, director of the Panorama section of the Berlin International Film Festival, will take home the Korean Cinema Award. The Panorama section has introduced dozens of Korean movies in Europe.\nAfter screening about 300 movies from 75 countries, the festival will close on Oct. 10 with the Chinese drama \"Mountain Cry\" by Larry Yang.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
