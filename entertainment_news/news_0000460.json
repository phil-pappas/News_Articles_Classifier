(March 20 - April 19): Start out small when changing your daily regimen. It's minor adjustments, not willpower, that produce the most lasting results.\nTAURUS. (April 20 - May 20): You're asked to make a personal sacrifice for the greater good, but hold off a bit before answering. You could still discover a way around this.\nGEMINI. (May 21 - June 20): You don't like to play the fuddy-duddy because you're a child at heart, but considering the lack of supervision today, it looks like you're the designated adult.\nCANCER. (June 21 - July 21): You tend to avoid confrontations, but dig in your heels and stand your ground. You can take the heat â€“ especially when it's only temporary.\nLEO.

(Dec. 21 - Jan. 19): There are hints of change in your love life. People see you as their Rock of Gibraltar, but someone new sees you in a sexier light.\nAQUARIUS. (Jan. 20 - Feb. 17): Don't rest on your laurels because your competition is counting on you to slow down after your recent victories. Keep pushing to the 27th.\nPISCES. (Feb. 18 - March 19): The secret to getting people to lend a hand is coordinating timetables. The clearer you are about what you need (and when), the faster they deliver.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T15:59:28.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
