The Spanish telenovela trend in the Philippines started in 1994 but began dwindling in popularity about a decade-and-a-half later as Asian dramas took over. However, it continues to have following particularly among young-to-middle aged women. \nBEAM Channel 31 (www.beam.com.ph) is a free-to-air TV owned and operated by Broadcast Enterprises and Affiliated Media, Inc. (BEAM), a subsidiary of Bethlehem Holdings, Inc., an investee of Globe Telecom’s Retirement Fund. \nBEAM started airing classic Spanish telenovelas in May this year with three maiden titles, classic hits La Madrasta (The Stepmother), Palabra de Mujer (A Woman’s Word), and Big Love (Llena de Amor). \nThe free-to-air broadcaster changed its program line-up after significantly improving its analog broadcast facilities while starting the deployment of a brand new digital ISDB-T broadcast network in its service areas of NCR, Cebu, Davao, Baguio, Naga, Iloilo and Zamboanga.
