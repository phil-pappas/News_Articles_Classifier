Some turn the diaper inside out. Or scrape away the soiled interior and fill it with brown paper towels. Some cover the dirty part with a grocery bag or a wipe. Or simply try to wash it off before putting it back on the baby.\nRochester — a city where one in two children is growing up in poverty — has many desperate parents. In July, Christina and Travis Foster started ROC City Bottoms, a nonprofit organization that aims to remove diapers from their long lists of things to worry about.\nNational Diaper Need Awareness week — an effort to publicize the struggle to afford diapers and its negative impact on babies — started Monday. In recognition, ROC City Bottoms is collecting diapers for Cameron Community Ministries, a nonprofit organization that helps people in the Lyell-Otis neighborhood.\nYou can help a local family in need. Here's how:\nDonate a package of diapers your child has outgrown, or buy a new package of diapers or wipes the next time you shop.\nDrop them off at one of our diaper drive locations, starting Monday.\nCurrent locations include:\nDemocrat and Chronicle, 55 Exchange Blvd, Rochester\nAsbury United Methodist Church, 1050 East Ave., Rochester\nRebirth Ministries, 221 Maltby St., Rochester\nSt. Paul Day Care, 3 Vick Park B Road, Rochester\nTLC Adventures in Child Care day care, 200 Bram Park Place, Greece\nTLC Adventures in Child Care day care, 7444 Victor-Mendon Road, Victor\nTLC Adventures in Child Care day care, 1030 Manitou Road, Hilton\nThe Sandbox Indoor Playground & Consignment, 1350 Fairport Road, Fairport\nToddler's Workshop, 12 May St, Webster\nEastview Mall, Route 96, Victor (box will be located in the Mothercare room off the food court)\nAll donations will go to ROC City Bottoms. More locations will be added. Check back for a complete list.\nSo far this year, Cameron Community Ministries has given away more than 2,700 diapers. The Cameron storehouse charges a small fee for most items, but diapers are gratis because they are so essential to babies' health and well-being, said Jennifer Muniga, Cameron Community Ministries' executive director.\nThe sight of a toddler who walked into the storehouse wearing a diaper that had been worn frontward, backward and inside-out is burned into her memory. \"It was just ballooned,\" Muniga said. \"He was waddling around uncomfortable and crying.\"\nParents who come in seeking diapers often look like they are about to cry themselves, she said.\nKeeping a baby in a dirty diaper can result in diaper rash and serious urinary tract infections. \"The number of office and emergency department visits for diaper dermatitis could potentially be reduced with an adequate supply of diapers,\" said the study \"Diaper Need and Its Impact on Child Health\" that was published in Pediatrics , the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\nThis report also notes that lack of diapers can interfere with a parent's ability to work, since child care centers require a supply of diapers. And that diaper need has been linked to abuse because it is difficult to console a child who is suffering with a painful rash. Parents who are stressed may respond to non-stop crying with violence.\n\"An adequate supply of diapers may prove to be a tangible way of reducing parenting stress and increasing parenting sense of competency, enabling parents to be more sensitive with their children and thereby improving parenting quality and overall child outcomes,\" said the study. \"For families who are financially struggling, health care professionals and researchers should recognize not only food and housing but also diapers as basic needs.\"\nJoin the Democrat and Chronicle and ROC City Bottoms in the fight to end diaper need in Rochester. Video by Lauren Petracca\nFood stamps and Women Infant and Child benefits can't be spent on diapers. The cost of an adequate supply — around $80 a month — represents about 6 percent of the gross pay of a person working 40 hours a week at minimum wage.\nParadoxically, people who can least afford diapers often end up paying the most for them. Cost per diaper is much lower if you can afford to join a wholesale club and have the spare cash to buy in bulk. One pack of size three diapers at BJs, for example, costs $22.99 for 160, or 14 cents a diaper. The corner store closest to Cameron Community Ministries sells an 18-pack of size 3 diapers for $5, or 27 cents a diaper — almost twice the cost at BJ's.\nJeremy Thompson came to Cameron Community Ministries last week to seek supplies for his family, including his children, 2 years old and 8 months.\nJeremy Thompson says diapers are expensive. (Photo: Erica Bryant)\nHe said that diapers are expensive, especially \"the kind where if they pee once or twice, it won't go straight through to their clothes.\" He works as a mover and said that even when money is tight, babies need diapers. \"What else are you going to put them in?\"\nFelicia Grant said she is so grateful that Cameron Community Ministries was there to provide diapers when she couldn't buy them for her daughter. \"They are awesome people,\" she said. \"There are a lot of people who are out there who need the help. It is very hard.\"\nROC City Bottoms founders Christina and Travis Foster know the feeling. They struggled to pay for diapers when they first moved back to Rochester and didn't find jobs as quickly as hoped. Family and friends helped them when money was short. Now that they are on their feet, they say they feel a responsibility to help young families who lack a support system.\n\"As parents, you don't want to see any child suffering anywhere,\" Christina Foster said. \"We want to make a support net just to let people know we do care about you and you're not alone.\"\nBuy Photo Travis Foster loads boxes of diapers into a car to take to Willow Domestic Violence Center as donations. (Photo: LAUREN PETRACCA/@laurenpetracca/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER)\nThe Fosters started ROC City Bottoms by putting out calls for diaper donations to friends and family and by publicizing diaper drives on social media. Since July, they have collected more than 5,000 diapers for nonprofits like Cameron Community Ministries, Willow Domestic Violence Center and for specific needy families. They hope to have a warehouse one day and to be able to provide a reliable supply of diapers to organizations that help those in need.\nA clearing house or storage facility for diapers in the Rochester area would be wonderful, says Maria Werhle, ministry leader for Mothers In Need of Others. Caseworkers from different social service agencies often call her when their clients need diapers and she puts out an \"all-points bulletin\" asking people at her church and supporters of her organization for donations of needed sizes.\n\"Diapers are absolutely critical for infants and young children for their personal hygiene and safety,\" she said. There should be more coordination between nonprofits, businesses, churches and government to meet the need, she said.\nSome question why food stamps can't be used to buy diapers. Rita Gaither, an Edison High School teacher and founder of Pearl Ministries, makes many visits to needy homes. She says that saggy, overfull diapers are much too common a sight.\n\"It looks the same in every household that you go to, they just don't have the money to buy the diapers,\" she said. \"Food stamps will pay for chips but won't pay for diapers.\"\nGwen Sparks, spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, says that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) provides nutrition assistance, so there is a limitation on \"non-food\" items like diapers.\nCash benefits that are given to the extremely needy can be used to buy diapers, but that doesn't help people who earn too much to qualify for that assistance program but too little to afford an adequate diaper supply. In other parts of the country, diaper banks exist to help fill that gap. According to the National Diaper Bank Network, there are at least three in New York, including Jillian's Drawers in Ithaca.\nChristina and Travis Foster hope ROC City Bottoms will grow into an official diaper bank. For now, they are storing stacks of donated diapers in the living room of their Rochester house. ROC City Bottoms takes cloth diapers and disposables, new boxes and partially opened packs that might be left over when a child finishes potty training. Donating diapers is a simple but important thing people can do to help struggling families and their innocent children, the Fosters say.\n\"Babies shouldn't be suffering,\" Christina Foster said. \"Everyone should have a great start in life.\"\nFor more information about ROC City Bottoms, call (585) 233-0867 or go to Roccitybottoms.org .\nEBRYANT@Gannett.com", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/30/Rochester/Rochester/635792104321108066-LP-roc-city-bottoms-B-093015-Metro.JPG", "http://bcdownload.gannett.edgesuite.net/rochester/36517057001/201510/3172/36517057001_4526371311001_900-diaperdrive.jpg?pubId=36517057001", "http://bcdownload.gannett.edgesuite.net/rochester/36517057001/201510/468/36517057001_4526364554001_180-daiperdrive.jpg?pubId=36517057001", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/01/Rochester/Rochester/635793098200975023-IMG-1611.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c59a69d3e4f195814a692bfdfd9bf3e506486c28/c=185-0-2845-2000&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/09/30/Rochester/Rochester/635792104321108066-LP-roc-city-bottoms-B-093015-Metro.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3df3aeaad16c73289bcadb449aa9d1900034d0ae/c=0-0-960-1280&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/10/01/Rochester/Rochester/635793098200975023-IMG-1611.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/734fac10538d13406c1d7cd31ef155a9e07b4676/r=300x400/local/-/media/2015/10/01/Rochester/Rochester/635793098200975023-IMG-1611.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8bb65a5d1bb033fb967b0c8b034dc8809a877a82/r=540&c=540x304/http/bcdownload.gannett.edgesuite.net/rochester/36517057001/201510/3172/36517057001_4526371311001_900-diaperdrive.jpg", "http://bcdownload.gannett.edgesuite.net/rochester/36517057001/201510/3172/36517057001_4526371311001_900-diaperdrive.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/09/30/Rochester/Rochester/635792104321108066-LP-roc-city-bottoms-B-093015-Metro.JPG", "http://www.roccitybottoms.org/", "http://on.rocne.ws/1LdxYJZ"], "published": "2015-10-02T01:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:35:13.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
