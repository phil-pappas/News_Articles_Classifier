He was briefly detained in 2011 and released after 81 days in jail. The authorities withheld his passport but returned it to him four years later, in July.\nSince then, the artist has toned down his criticisms of the government. He has travelled to Germany and England, but is in Beijing to visit his mother, Gao Ying, as reported by Radio Free Asia. Liu confirmed the report.\nGao told Radio Free Asia that she believed the devices were installed by the Chinese authorities four years ago when Ai's studio was ransacked by the authorities. Ai himself has been under tight surveillance since his 2011 release.\nIn social media, Liu said the bugs were found as Ai was renovating the studio. The devices were found in a living room, an office and a bedroom, Liu said.\nRelated Stories Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei opens retrospective London show Ai Weiwei says China promised he can return", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:45:01.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
