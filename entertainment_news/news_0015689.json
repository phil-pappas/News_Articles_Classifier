Photo: Paul Jeffers \nSPONSORED \nDevotion to detail has brought Rita Ambroz and Joe Jones recognition. Their bar, Romeo Lane, won  The Age Good Food Guide  2016 Bar of the Year just 12 months after opening. \n\"It's all in the details, from the rows of cut-glass decanters that glitter against every dark wooden panel to the most perfectly crafted Trinidad sour you're likely to find in the city,\" said the  Good Food Guide judges.\nMichael Madrusan at the Everleigh, Fitzroy.

Good times and Billie Holiday guaranteed – oh, and it's open both early (3pm) and late, for your drinking pleasure.\"\nAdvertisement Devotion to detail, and to serving a diversity of drinks in spaces both small and curated or large and loud, is what helps make Melbourne's bar scene so enticing. \nAt Boilermaker House on Lonsdale Street, courtesy of the same team behind Eau de Vie bar (EDV), easy-drinking beers and whiskies slake thirsts, while cheeses and charcuterie satisfy the peckish.\nIn the charmed hands of bartenders, beer paired with a nip of thoughtfully considered whisky can become a thing of wonder, to be admired and enjoyed. When your beer or brew of choice is served until 3am, it's more charming still.\nMichael Madrusan, the man behind The Everleigh in Fitzroy, is devoted to creating exceptional drinks and exceptional spaces in which to enjoy them; a devotion that began with the most basic ingredient of all – ice.\nEarly in his bar-tending career, Madrusan spent three months of a New York City winter cutting ice by hand to get his foot in the door at Milk & Honey, the legendary Manhattan bar that put together a superb drinks selection for a thirsty, sophisticated crowd. \n\"I used to go in during the off-hours and cut ice with a hammer and an icepick,\" he says. \"It took me three months before I got my first shift.\" That first shift was as a host, not a bartender: \"It was six months between my first hosting gig and my first bar shift.\"\n\"When I came in it was an incredibly romantic time to be a bartender. We had this reputation, we were part of something really big. Seeing what Milk and Honey has inspired around the world – it's pretty nuts.\"\nThe Everleigh is regularly named in lists of the world's best bars and Madrusan is likewise sought out for his mixology expertise. \nTash Conte is one of the Melbourne bar scene's originals – she opened Black Pearl Bar in Fitzroy in 2001. BPB is a regular in the world's 50 best bar lists and Conte says that being a family business is one of the keys to their longevity and success.\nThe Pearl's upstairs Attic bar has table service, select beers and wines are available and staff make the sodas and syrups in-house from scratch.\n\"It's about selling great drinks, creating a great ambience and offering great hospitality,\" Conte says.\n\nPost Melbourne festival bars \n\nBoilermaker House \nRotating tap beers, diverse easy-drinking brews, whiskies galore and excellent offerings from the kitchen, all downed in a bar that seems fashionably tatty, in a good way.\n209 Lonsdale Street, 0424 270 082.
