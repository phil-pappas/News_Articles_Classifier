It's time to Roar . It's time for #puli.. it's #showtime..\" tweeted actor Hansika Motwani, who is part of the film.\n\nCEO of AGS Cinemas, Archana Kalpathi said that all issues have been \"resolved\".\n\"All issues resolved. Join us in wishing the team of #Puli tremendous box office success. The wait it over #FDFS @ags_cinemas,\" she said in a tweet that was retweeted by many users.\n\n\"Puli\" (Tiger) stars Vijay, Shruti Haasan, Motwani and Sridevi, among others and is directed by Simbudevan, who has churned out hits like \"Imsai Arasan Irubathi moondram Pulikesi\".\n\nEarlier, the I-T department had conducted raids at the premises of Vijay and the producers of the film.\n\nIncidentally, release time issues have become routine for Vijay, starting with \"Thuppaki\", when Muslim groups had objected to the portrayal of their community in the action thriller.\n\nLater \"Thalaiva\" faced roadblocks with a small outfit raising objections even as his next venture \"Kaththi\" faced opposition from pro-Sri Lankan Tamil outfits who were against the producers of the movie, claiming they were close to the then Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa.\n\nTwo theatres screening the movie were also attacked by some fringe outfits.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T15:03:12.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
