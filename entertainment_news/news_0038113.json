The Republican governor and the Democratic legislative leaders are now trying to one-up each other on setting up a meeting.\nLast week, a half-dozen advocacy groups, fed up with inaction that's left the state without a budget since July 1, called on Gov. Bruce Rauner and legislative leaders to get together and discuss the matter. The groups wrote a letter offering to set up such a meeting, saying it should happen before Nov. 15 “due to the urgent need for resolution on this issue.”\nDemocratic House Speaker Michael Madigan accepted the invitation and suggested making the meeting public. Democratic Senate President John Cullerton also agreed. The Union League Club offered its downtown location as a venue, and a date was set for Nov. 18.\nNot so fast, said Republican Rauner, who weighed in on Friday with a letter of his own.\n“As you know, leaders meetings are held and conducted by the governor’s office,” Rauner wrote. “As such, while we appreciate the advocacy groups desire to be involved, we will pick up the organization of the meeting from here.”\nRauner’s offer: A meeting in the governor’s office, in Springfield or Chicago, on the same date and time – Nov. 18, 9:30 a.m. Rauner said his staff would circulate an agenda in advance of the meeting and would coordinate with leaders “on the most appropriate media access.”\nA spokeswoman for Cullerton said he’s in. But Madigan spokesman Steve Brown wouldn’t commit.\n“There was a plan in place and we were prepared to be part of that,” Brown said. “Now the governor is kind of changing things around, so we’ll wait and see some details.”\nThere's little for Rauner to gain by attending a public meeting he's not in control of that could feature a string of regular folks hurt by the lack of the budget telling their stories or even protesting.\nRauner has made approval of his pro-business, union-weakening agenda a condition to discuss a tax hike to bail out state government. Democrats oppose Rauner's plan and argue it shouldn't be tied to a new budget. (Kim Geiger)\nWhat's on tap\n* Mayor Rahm Emanuel will give an afternoon speech on \"the importance of efficient city services.\"\n* Gov. Bruce Rauner will attend a Jewish National Fund event in the morning and then he's off to the Quad Cities to visit a school and some businesses.\nFrom the notebook\n*Obama's Chicago fundraisers: President Barack Obama, who hits Chicago on Tuesday for a speech to the International Association of Chiefs of Police, also will host a fundraiser for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, a White House aide said.\nThe fundraiser is a 3 p.m. “intimate discussion” with an ask of “a minimum $10,000” to benefit the DSCC, according to an invitation obtained by the Tribune.\nThe event — dubbed a “special round-table discussion” — will be limited to 20 guests, according to the invite, which says the top annual contribution to the DSCC is $33,400 a year.\nObama also is to attend a Tuesday fundraising dinner hosted by Robbie Robinson, managing director of BDT & Co., and his wife, D’Rita, founder and CEO of Chatty Guest. Co-hosts are being asked to contribute $33,400 and guests, $10,000, according to an invitation.\nThe first $2,500 of each contribution to the dinner will go to Obama for America — the president's principal campaign committee — for 2012 general election debt retirement. Contributions above $2,500 go to the Democratic National Committee.\nThe president plans to stay overnight in Chicago and return to Washington, D.C. on Wednesday. (Katherine Skiba)\n*Budget tweaks?: The City Council Finance Committee meeting today provides the last chance for aldermen to tweak Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s proposed $7.8 billion 2016 spending plan before the final vote at Wednesday’s meeting.\nSome aldermen are expected to try to require ride-sharing service drivers, who Emanuel wants to give pickup privileges at O’Hare and Midway airports and McCormick Place, to jump through more hoops and pay more fees to get those rights.\nThe mayor’s changes also include a 15 percent fare hike for taxis as part of an overall plan to generate nearly $49 million more in taxes and fees from both industries.\nOther amendments offered up by members of the Progressive Reform Caucus aim to extend the city’s 9 percent amusement tax to tickets purchased for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the Lyric Opera and horse-drawn carriage rides.\nStill intact and expected to pass Wednesday: the record-setting $543 million property tax hike to increase police and fire pension fund contributions and a $9.50-per-month fee for city trash hauling at single-family homes, duplexes and four-flats. (Hal Dardick)\n*More backing: Cook County Commissioner John Fritchey, D-Chicago, who flirted with the idea of running for state’s attorney next year, is endorsing lawyer Donna More in that race.\nMore, a former state and federal prosecutor, plans to run against Anita Alvarez, who is seeking a third term, and former state prosecutor Kimberly Foxx, who is backed by Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle.\n“I am convinced that she is the only candidate in the race who has the vision, competence and independence to restore justice to the criminal justice system and to restore the public’s faith in the state's attorney's office,\" Fritchey said.\nThe endorsement is just another case in which Preckwinkle and Fritchey don’t see eye to eye. He opposed her successful effort to increase the county sales tax by a penny-on-the-dollar starting Jan. 1.
