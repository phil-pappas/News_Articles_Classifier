There have been a number of leaks regarding \"Captain America: Civil War.\" As such, we've taken the liberty of rounding up 5 major ones, as follows: Like Us on Facebook Spider-Man Cameo It's been buzzed about that Spidey will reportedly appear in the upcoming Marvel flick. A number of reports have emerged that appeared to confirm, albeit unofficially, that the web slinger will indeed be in the movie. And now, Tom Holland, who's been cast as Spider-Man in his younger and less-experienced self, recently revealed he sustained injuries on the \"Captain America\" set. So, considering his injuries, will he battle it out with Cap or Iron Man? Apparently, the scrapes were sustained out of the actor's own mistake. \"I basically fell over and bashed my face in front of about two hundred crew members, so not my most heroic moment!\" he was quoted by CinemaBlend as saying. \"It was luckily just before my last shot; they were like, 'Roll cameras!' I was getting into position, everything went wrong, and they still did the take anyway. It looks great, and they'll probably just CGI out all the blood, and yeah, I was very lucky.\" It's not certain what's Spidey's involvement is in the film. Some reports have said he'll only do a cameo on the flick. Plot Leaked A plot description made the rounds on cybersphere, sparking various sorts of speculations about the upcoming blockbuster. It described Spider-Man as \"catching some criminals, which switches to a Congress hearing discussing the matter, with some politicians advocating for the Superhero Registration Act,\" as noted by MoviePilot . Further, Tony Stark learned that Bucky, Cap's former best friend, had killed his father and thus wants him in. As such, Stark supported the SHRA. It appears that Bucky is the catalyst to the friction between Cap and Stark, as the former still believed that his old friend was just brainwashed and hence innocent. Stark did not share the same belief, though, hence the conflict. Additionally - making this the third spoiler - Hawkeye was reportedly attacked and captured by Crossbones in his own farm. His wife got killed in the process. \"He's then taken to HYDRA's lair and tortured for information in Fury's secret network, which only Barton is privy to, but doesn't break,\" MoviePilot went on. A Superhero Will Die Heroic Hollywood said that someone on the side of good will die in \"Civil War.\" If you don't want to know who this hero is just yet, stop reading right now. So, whose life will be lost in the battle? The report said it will be Black Panther's father, T'Chaka. \"T'Chaka was the Chieftan of Wakanda, pledged to protect the sacred metal known as Vibranium,\" the site noted. \"From an early age, he excelled in the ways of magic and took a stance to preserve Wakanda's heritage by honoring the 'old ways' of magic use despite the technological advancements of Wakanda.\" Spidey's Fighting Who? Leaked information about the next \"Captain America\" sequel hinted that Spider-Man will reportedly fight Captain America himself. Spidey had sided with Iron Man, hence the alleged confrontation, some suspected.
