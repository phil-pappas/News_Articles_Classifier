Photo: Steven Siewert \nLike its lanky, bearded creator,  Mulga's Magical Colouring Book  stands out in a crowd. Zombies with bushranger beards, gorillas with facial piercings, toucans in baseball caps and skulls fill the pages drawn by Mulga, the 33-year-old artist known to his mother as Joel Moore.\nMore than  a million colouring books for adults have been sold in Australia this year, according to Bookscan.\n Most feature \"flowery, leafy type of things\", Mulga says. \"There are no zombies. It's more feminine stuff. They're definitely prettier designs.\"\nOne of the illustrations from Mulga's Magical Colouring Book. Photo: Supplied \nIn contrast, Mulga says his contribution is \"a bit edgier, fresh\".\nAdvertisement A father of three children,  Mulga says his colouring book is for people of all ages. \n\"I think it's meditative, relaxing, it gets you away from your iPhone to spend time with your kids,\" he says. \nBut not everyone is enamoured of the burgeoning genre. Giramondo publisher and academic Ivor Indyk​ dismisses the genre's self-declared therapeutic and creative aspects in an essay in the  Sydney Review of Books . \nHe concludes: \"[B]y stressing the spiritual possibilities of colouring in for adults, you guard against those who would take the opposite view, that the phenomenon plays on the infantilism of the reading public, and is a sign of the progressive devaluation of the significance of the book.\"\nCartoonist and author Oslo Davis also scoffs at adult colouring books.\n\"It reeks of a fad, like speed reading, basket making with straws and shrinking Twisties packets in the oven to make brooches,\" he says. \"I can imagine Kath and Kel [from the sitcom  Kath & Kim ] colouring in a few pages in bed before going to sleep.\"    \nDavis'  This Annoying Life is subtitled  A Mindless Colouring Book for the Highly Stressed , and contains \"scenes of angst and stress\", such as a visit to the dentist, broken shopping bags and sleeping next to a snorer.\nDavis concedes that colouring in is \"weirdly enjoyable\": \"I'm not sure if it's therapeutic, but it's oddly calming.\"\nHe does not believe the genre's popularity has peaked yet: \"We are in a colouring book boom and like Sudoku it will level out and be with us for a while. I just hope the pictures get better.\" \nThis Annoying Life will be published in December, but Mulga's colouring book has already had an initial print run of 45,000, with more than 11,000 copies sold in less than two months. It will also be released in North America after the rights were sold to Little, Brown USA.\nBut that pales in comparison to leading adult colouring books such as Johanna Basford's​  Secret Garden: An Inky Treasure Hunt and Colouring Book , which has sold more than a million copies since its release in 2013.\nBookscan reports half of the 30 top-selling books in Australia are adult colouring books, with  Mulga's Magical Colouring Book  already ranked 24th following its release in September.\nHachette Australia and New Zealand's joint managing director Louise Sherwin-Stark says publishers are struggling to keep up with demand for colouring books for grown-ups. \n\"The craze was started by the Hachette France Art Therapy range of colouring in books, which promoted colouring in as a short cut to mindfulness and meditation,\" she says. \"New titles are being released every day and there will be hundreds to choose from in the run-up to Christmas.\"\nIn fact, adult colouring books featuring Hindu and Buddhist symbolism could be found in book shops as far back as the 1980s, while titles featuring the likes of gangsta rapper 2Pac and indie bands have also been published.\nThe publishing director of HarperCollins, Shona Martyn, says British publishers initially failed to emulate the popularity of French colouring books.\n\"Books were printed, unloved and even pulped,\" she says. \"This year though, the trend has finally caught on and publishers in Australia, New Zealand and overseas are seeing huge sales.\"\nMartyn says the escalating sales of adult colouring books is reminiscent of the popularity of Sudoku books in the late-1990s: \"We are told colouring pencil manufacturers are struggling to keep up with demand.\"\nMartyn says adult colouring books are a spin-off from the mind, body, spirit market, with women aged 18 to 40 the predominant readership.\n\"It is primarily a solitary pursuit, but some colourers like to sit with friends as they work,\" she says. \"Because the patterns are intricate, the adult colouring books are not suitable for children. They also appeal to people who like crafts such as knitting and crochet, which are creative and require concentration.\"\nA  Game of Thrones  colouring book featuring artwork by illustrators admired by George R.R. Martin will be released for Christmas, she says. \"This is more of a novelty stocking filler. The in-joke is that only black, white and red pencils will be required.\"   \nMelbourne designer Thomas Pavitte, meanwhile, has created two large adult colouring books –  1000 Dot-to-Dot Books  and  Querkles  – with intricate patterns: \"The inspiration came from my curiosity in pushing the boundaries for what can be achieved by primitive forms of art.\" \nWelsh author Millie Marotta​ is one of the leading exponents of the genre with sales of her  Animal Kingdom  and  Tropical Wonderland  approaching 100,000 copies.\nShe says colouring books enable readers to relax and switch off from the digital devices that dominate their lives.\nYet the online world may also contribute to sales, with readers showing off their colouring skills on social media sites.\n\"I've been gobsmacked by some of the incredible examples being shared over social media,\" Marotta says. \n\"I hadn't really anticipated this at the beginning and it's been amazing to see how readers are turning each illustration into a completely unique piece of artwork.\"\nBut Davis says adult colouring books make \"zero demands\" on a reader's creativity, labelling them \"the most limp of arts, if you could even call it an art\".\n\"It's like the visual version of humming a Taylor Swift song, or chewing bubble gum,\" he says. \"You do it while you watch TV or think about something else. When we had landlines at home we'd doodle all over the Yellow Pages. Colouring-in feels like that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:29:49.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
