Giuliana Rancic can’t say anything about Kathy Griffin abruptly quitting “Fashion Police” but that diplomacy doesn’t apply to her hubby Bill.\nWhen Confidenti@l caught up with the couple at the Annual Pink Agenda Gala in New York, Giuliana politely declined to comment on whether Griffin “threw the show under the bus” when she quickly departed. But she did refer the question to her husband of eight years who comically raised his eyebrows to imply he certainly believed so.\nGriffin exited the E! show after only seven episodes and announced it via social media.\n“I do not want to use my comedy to contribute to a culture of unattainable perfectionism and intolerance towards differences,” the comic tweeted.\nThe former E! host who had breast cancer founded her own charitable group called FAF-U-WISH that partnered with the Breast Cancer Research Foundation.\nThe genesis of FAB-U-WISH came about when Rancic was going through her hew own health issues.\nNBCUniversal/Christopher Polk/NBCUniversal Brad Goreski, Melissa Rivers and Giuliana Rancic from E!’s “Fashion Police.” “I was diagnosed with breast cancer four years ago and after my double mastectomy I went back to work at E!” she explained “I went through hair and makeup and picked an outfit and when I looked in the mirror, it was the first time in a very long time that I recognized myself.\n“… Just seeing the face that I recognized just made me feel better and I thought, ‘We’ve got to do this for other women so I came up with FAB-U-WISH. Basically what we do is grant fabulous themed wishes to women undergoing breast cancer treatment.”\nThe 41-year-old celebrity has been going through some major changes recently. She’s no longer the full time host at E! News (although she still does “Fashion Police” and the channel’s red carpet coverage) and is now concentrating on other businesses.\n“I did E! news day in and day out for 14 years and leaving felt like graduation,” Giuliana noted. “At some point, as much as you love college, you’ve got to graduate and move onto different things. So I’m very excited. I’ve been focusing a lot on growing my HSN business – I’ve a line of clothing, we just added denim.”\nShe’s also a vintier with the XOG brand and owns RPM restaurant in Chicago with Bill. The couple are also parents to 3-year-old Duke who just started pre-school, a transition that Bill laughingly admits was hardest on him.\nNBC NewsWire/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images Bill and Giuliana Rancic with son Duke on the “Today” show. “It was tough,” Giuliana confessed. “We were definitely emotional because he didn’t want to go and I was like, ‘Do you think we should go back and get him?’ Everyone kept telling us, ‘Don’t do it, just let him be,’ and now he loves school.”\nBill Rancic who got his start as the very first winner of “The Apprentice” is thrilled that his old boss, Donald Trump is in the news.\n“Donald Trump was amazing to me,” he raved. “He certainly changed my life. If it weren’t for him I wouldn’t be married to Giuliana, I wouldn’t have my son Duke. He’s certainly someone that I owe a debt of gratitude to.”\nSo has he got Bill’s vote?\n“I would take a bullet for Donald Trump,” he responded. “He’s someone I will always support and I believe in.”\nWith Nicki Gostin\nRelated Stories Giuliana Rancic, Bill Rancic reveal surrogate miscarries second child Maria Menounos replaces Giuliana Rancic as E!
