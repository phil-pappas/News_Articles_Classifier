Why is that twin putting on a fake posh accent? Wonder if hair ended up in his food from the over egg'd hair flicks 😁 #firstdates #awks \n— Lisa M M (@LisaMayle) October 15, 2015 Promoted stories \nWorst chat \nNow you might have noticed, Hugo looks a lot like Spencer Matthews from Made In Chelsea. But Hugo thinks he looks much more like Buzz Lightyear. He’s even perfected “the Buzz face”. BUZZ LIGHTYEAR FACE!! Bluddy hilarious hahaha #FirstDates \n— Lauren Teague (@LilGirlGK) October 15, 2015 \nWhich led to the worst chat of their date, when Hugo asked if Francesca liked some “toy action”. Buzz light year…a bit of toy action #firstdates \n— James Kirtland (@CurlySoccerAM) October 15, 2015 Imagine thinking of Buzz Lightyear during sex? #FirstDates \n— Ken Shabby (@MrKenShabby) October 15, 2015 \nAnother date? \nBut in the back room Hugo was quick to admit he didn’t really fancy poor Fran, which she agreed with, naturally… only we weren’t sure she wasn’t telling porkies. Oh my, that girl just got served on First Dates. I'm sure there were public executions that were less brutal. Cold Hugo. Cold #firstdates \n— James Doherty (@James_Doherty) October 15, 2015 Claudia and Marcus (Channel 4) \nMeanwhile, the other twin got landed with an absolutely lovely bloke called Marcus. And the pair of them seemed such a match! Marcus & Claudia, so cute ❤. How every first date should start! Smiley and coy and lots of eye contact \nWorst chat \nClaudia went for the most terrible of all icebreakers – the classic “heritage” question. 'What's your… Heritage?' \nHowever, when we found out we couldn’t help but be glad Claudia asked. #firstdates wow what a mix !!!
