It’s hysterical.”\nWinslet, 39, said she feels proud not to reveal much about her failed marriages to Jim Threapleton (1998-2001) and Sam Mendes (2003-11).\n“No one really knows what has happened in my life. No one really knows why my first marriage didn’t last; no one knows why my second didn’t. And I’m proud of those silences.\n“I know lots of people who are not in the public eye who have gone through several marriages, I really do, and it’s just those are the cards that life dealt me. I didn’t plan on it being that way… It hasn’t been easy, you know.”\nFirst Published on October 02, 2015 4:36 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:35:49.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
