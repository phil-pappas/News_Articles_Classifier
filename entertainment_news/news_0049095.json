It's been a busy week. How about a nap? For the Casper Nap Tour , the mattress-maker has outfitted a trailer with four pods to make a Napmobile, allowing you to get some rest (or, judging from the photo, maybe make a few phone calls). \"Businesses should start considering naps as a new way to increase productivity,\" it says here. \"Naps can restore alertness, enhance performance, and reduce mistakes and accidents.\" Want numbers? They have numbers: 1 in 5 people in Philly (23 percent) would give part of their paid time off for workday naps, 52 percent would give up free coffee for naps at the office, and 74 percent would like their workplace to provide a nap room (we usually just curl up under the desk, but it's rough on the back). The Napmobile will be at the lot at 1950 Sansom St. Times: Noon to 8 p.m. Admission is free; reservations required. Information: www.casper.com/naptour#philadelphia . Friday-Saturday \nThings to come With a little help from her friends, Toshi Reagon performs a work-in-progress concert version of her gospel-rock opera Parable of the Sower , based on Octavia E.

The show goes on at the Annenberg Center, 3680 Walnut St. Times: 8 p.m. Friday, 2 and 8 p.m. Saturday. Tickets: $30. Information: 215-898-3900 or www.annenbergcenter.org .
