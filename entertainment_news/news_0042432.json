Thursday morning, the National Weather Service was forecasting a 70 percent chance of rain tonight and a 90 percent chance Saturday night. Some of the rains are expected to be heavy.\nAnd so, big changes had to be made to the eighth annual event, a free arts festival taking place today and Saturday.\nMore Information Luminaria\nWhen: 7 p.m. to midnight today-Saturday.\nWhere: The center of the Luminaria footprint is the San Antonio Museum of Art , 200 W. Jones Ave. The museum will be open until midnight both nights. Regular admission fees — $5 to $10 — will be charged, though the additional fee for the blockbuster exhibit “28 Chinese” is being waived both nights.\nAdmission: Free.\nGetting there: VIA will be running buses from the Crossroads Park & Ride, Interstate 10 and Loop 410, every 15 minutes both nights. Rides cost $5 for a round trip. VIA also is extending the blue circulator route, which starts at the Blue Star Arts Complex, all the way to Luminaria; the cost is $1.20 per ride, and exact change is required.\nSouvenirs: For the first time, Luminaria is offering more than T-shirts to those who would like mementos. Bound programs will be available for $20. In addition, there will be insulated water bottles as well as wallet flashlights, umbrellas and two T-shirt designs. The price range for those items is $4 to $22.\nFood: Food trucks from the Downtown Mobile Food Truck Program are slated to be on site. At press time, there had been no announcement of a change to that plan.\nOne night only: Musician and visual artist Stephen O’Malley will perform at 9 p.m. Saturday night at Ten Eleven , 1011 Avenue B.\n“I think we’ve come up with a really good solution,” Armstrong said.\nFor one thing, the footprint — which radiates from the San Antonio Museum of Art — has been changed. Maverick Park is out of the picture entirely. And a stage that was to be set up in the museum parking lot was eliminated, too.\nThe number of artists was reduced, as well, with most of the dancers among the first to go. (One exception: Miguel Gutierrez , who will be performing on a stage inside the museum.)\n“We can’t ensure there will be a dry, safe surface for them to dance on,” said Sarah Fisch , media manager for the event.\nAll of the outdoor video projections were cut, too, as a safety measure.\nA few extra events scheduled for Saturday — a master class by Oui Danse, a marimba workshop by Rattletree and a lunch with Margarita Cabrera — had to be canceled, as well.\nMost of the outdoor performances had to be canceled. But organizers were able to tent Stage 2 , which is in the Luminaria office parking lot at 1001 Broadway. So that lineup will proceed as scheduled. It includes “The Case of the Flaming Starship and the Noirtese Falcon” by the Overtime Theater and music performances by Alyson Alonzo , DT Buffkin, Femina X, Chrysta Bell and the Bolos.\nAnother outdoor piece that will go ahead is a new work being created by theater artist Virginia Grise , multidisciplinary artist Rafa Esparza and poet Joe Jiménez . Grise described the original concept for the piece as a “performance ritual,” which is to take place on a lot near VFW Post 76 at the corner of Avenue B and 10th Street. It was to have included a soundscape, which called for speakers and microphones; that part has been scrapped.\nGrise, Esparza and Jiménez have put their heads together to rework the piece.\n“It is now a super-intimate performance,” said Armstrong.\nThe good news is that the San Antonians can expect to see some of the work that won’t be shown this weekend some time in the future. Since Luminaria is now a year-round organization, a shift that began with Armstrong’s appointment to a three-year hitch at the helm, its programming isn’t limited to one or two days a year.\n“We know that so many artists have put their hearts and souls into making these projects, and these are not going back into the studio,” Armstrong said. “We are going to find a way to showcase them.”\ndlmartin@express-news.net\nTwitter: @DeborahMartinEN", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/23/8832211/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/23/8832211/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/23/8832210/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "https://www.samuseum.org/", "http://www.theteneleven.com/", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/23/8832210/5/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T19:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:21:16.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
