Thereafter, global warming continues as if the AMOC never collapsed, but with a globally averaged temperature offset of about 0.8 degree C. \nDrijfhout said that the planet earth recovers from the AMOC collapse in about 40 years when global warming continues at present-day rates, but near the eastern boundary of the North Atlantic (including the British Isles) it takes more than a century before temperature is back to normal. \nHowever, the study says that the recent period of very weak warming cannot be attributed to one single cause. Most probably El Ni \no plays a role and possibly also changes in the Southern Ocean due to shifting and increasing westerlies. \nThe study appears in Scientific Reports.
