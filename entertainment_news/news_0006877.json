In this poetry collection, Poems From the Path, author Ruey Ryburn shares the journey from grief to joy, from hopelessness to inner peace.\nIn this anthology, the author illustrates that life can again become meaningful and joy-filled after deep grief and loss, if one is willing to undergo the intense inner examination of uncomfortable feelings associated with the death of loved one. A person can let go and find the light at the end of the tunnel by going through that inner connection to the Divine Presence.\nThis collection of poems was written since the passing of the author's daughter Mindy, who was a wonderful poet. These myriad poems describe the pain and despair of losing a beloved, as well as the journey of a deepening and sweet connection to Spirit that heals and restores faith.\nGarnished with beautiful photography by Kauakea Winston, this poetry book brings hope, inner peace, and grace to seekers wishing to ease the despair from loss. It also guides the reader into a meditative awakening into Divine Presence.\nThe book is available online and can be purchased at www.amazon.com and www.barnesandnoble.com\nAbout the Author\nRuey Ryburn is a certified practitioner of Brennan Healing Science.
