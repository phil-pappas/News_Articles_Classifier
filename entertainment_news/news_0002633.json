She chose a light blue Jenny Packham dress for the event.\nThe two princes wore tuxedos, which have been something of a Bond trademark since the days when Sean Connery played 007 for the first time in \"Dr. No\" in 1962.\nThe royals, who arrived in a Bentley, were greeted by director Sam Mendes and co-producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson.\nCraig, accompanied by his film star wife Rachel Weisz, patiently posed for dozens of selfies with adoring fans. He told reporters he had \"loved every minute\" he's spent as Bond and declined to answer questions about whether he would return for a fifth turn as the sexy, world-saving British agent.\nSeydoux wore a shimmering gold backless gown for the night that marked her emergence as the latest in a long line of romantic interests for the suave British agent. Belluci, also a love interest in the film, wore a dark gown with a plunging neckline.\nNaomie Harris, reprising her role as loyal Miss Moneypenny, wore a low-cut full length orange dress to the premiere.\nThey were joined by Christoph Waltz, the Academy Award winner recruited to play villain Franz Oberhauser, who challenges Bond in a series of exotic locales, and Ben Whishaw, who has an expanded role as the gadget master Q.\nBritish critics have praised the film and Craig's performance.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:45:04.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
