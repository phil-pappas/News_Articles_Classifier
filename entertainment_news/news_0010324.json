The \"Blank Space\" hitmaker couldn't bring her pets with her when she traveled to Toronto, Canada for her \"1989 World Tour\". Taylor posted on Instagram a picture of her, wearing a grey hoodie, cuddling with her cat Meredith as her pet looked into the camera with little to no expression. \"Meredith is allergic to joy,\" the \"Bad Blood\" songstress captioned it. Ellen Pompeo , whose \" Grey's Anatomy \" character inspired the cat's name, commented on Taylor's photo, \"That's because she's dark and twisty!\" The posting was retweeted by the singer. A photo posted by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Oct 4, 2015 at 12:34pm PDT On Saturday, Taylor shared a photo of her hugging an oversized cutout of one of her cats, Olivia Benson, with a sad look on her face. She wrote alongside the snap, \"When you can't take your cats to Canada so you hug a cardboard version of them but it's NOT THE SAME.\" A photo posted by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Oct 3, 2015 at 1:23pm PDT Taylor performed with Charli XCX during her concert in Toronto on Saturday night, October 3.
