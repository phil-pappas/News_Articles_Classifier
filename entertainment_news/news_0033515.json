I do not affiliate nor associate with any political party. I believe there are many South Africans; whom like me just take things as they come and focus on personal struggles to forge a better and brighter future for selves.\nThe current student uprising has however left me shockingly emotional. My eyes more than watered as the angry and panicking voice of young Chikane struggled to articulate “the point of it all”. This seems to be what everyone is missing; the call for fees to remain as they are instead of shooting up and gradually work towards making education free. I found myself wondering if our plight for freedom was not in vain, considering that education is catalyst to the growth of any society. How are we then to develop and flourish as a country if we cannot educate our future?.\nI grew up in rural (then) Transkei, shielded from the reality of what the country went through. All of my childhood oblivious to the difference between poor and rich and amazingly content with my circumstances. My single mother thought it wise to bring me to Cape Town where she worked as a domestic worker for my secondary level schooling. I arrived to a shocking discovery of knowing I was poor, black and have a bleak future. We had a one roomed shack, housing my mother, aunt, myself, a cousin and two younger siblings. I had always considered myself bright at school, always part of the top three in class. It shocked me to depression mode to fail my first official exams which were the midyear exams of that year.\nHow do you then as a young person focus on your schooling if in the morning you wake up at 5am because someone else is up. Sleep with one eye opened for fear of rats biting your ear or heel. Have to prepare and take to school siblings and miss morning classes. Have to rush home after school and miss afternoon classes so you can be on time to fetch the same siblings from school. Cannot study at home because the television is blaring as well as the voices of everyone inside. How do you then achieve “A” grades required by bursary awarders. This sadly is the reality of more than 11% of our young people.\nI consider myself lucky that my matric results were good enough and I could get in at (the then) Cape Technicon. My excitement was however short lived as my eyes darted down to the registration amount. A lousy R1’500.00; but that was what my mother earned as a domestic worker. I spent that year with aching feet working as waitress trying to save for the next year even that could not get me through tertiary. 15 years after I matriculated I am still working towards my education, not because I am lazy, I do not fail; but because education in South Africa is exorbitantly expensive when measured against what the poor in this country earn (and no; I do not have a child; by choice).\nI guess the tears burning my eyes as I write this and going through the images of what is happening bring back the reality of my own pains and struggles. I’ve been part of the working class for well over 10 years, earning (today) a mere R7’300 ctc per month. I feel the pain of this students, it is my pain, my life, my past, my future. I was not there in 76, but yesterday I lived that June 16.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:45:17.522+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
