Putnam's Sons), by Robin Cook \nRobin Cook's latest novel, \"Host,\" is the story of a frightening moneymaking scheme that leaves patients brain-dead. \n\"Host\" mirrors the plot of 1977's \"Coma,\" but with new characters. In this story, healthy patients undergo minor surgery but fail to wake up from anesthesia and end up at a spooky facility for the comatose. This photo provided by Penguin Random House shows the cover of the book, \"Host,\" by author Robin Cook. (Penguin Random House via AP) \nLynn Peirce, a medical student, risks her life and career to prove the mishaps are intentional. (Her boyfriend is one of the victims.) \nAction scenes involving a group of Russians that maintains the hospital's machines that monitor the vital signs of patients under anesthesia are brutally intense. \nA medical thriller cannot get any better than \"Host.\" \nOnline: \nhttp://robincook.com/ \nThink your friends should see this?
