It's so powerful.\" \nThe event going ahead was conditional on 58 people buying tickets to the screening at Mackay City Cinemas. \nAt the time of writing 76 tickets had been sold. \nMaya Newell was inspired to make the film, with the tagline 'same-sex families told by the kids,' as she was raised by two mothers. \nThe film garnered national attention after the New South Wales government banned its screening in schools. film", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:45:55.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
