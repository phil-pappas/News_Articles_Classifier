Pic/Santa Banta \nVin Diesel said that he's up for the role that didn't need his voice. Following Vin Diesel's statement, people were quick to guess that the character would be Black Bold, reports aceshowbiz.com.\n\"I can totally be something (else) with Marvel,\" Vin Diesel was quoted as saying by io9.\n\"I think playing that role only makes Marvel that much more excited and me having my experience with Marvel, seeing how great they were, makes me more excited. We've heard a lot of talk about Marvel wanting to have me play a character that doesn't have my voice. So my voice is used for Groot and my presence is used for the other character,\" he added.\nIn the comic books, Black Bolt a.k.a. Blackagar Boltagon is the ruler of the Inhumans. He has an ability to unleash great destructive power through the use of his voice. Thus, he chooses to remain silent for most of the time.\n'Inhumans' is scheduled to be released in US on July 19, 2019.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:16:19.178+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
