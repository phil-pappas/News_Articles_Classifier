TV and Radio Why you cant stop: When binge TV turns bad \nStreaming giant Netflix is on the rise in Australia, with one in 10 homes around the country subscribing to the service since its local launch in March. \nBut let's not forget competitors Stan and Presto are also vying for a chunk of your screen time. How could you possibly choose which one is the right fit for you? \nUnREAL follows the exploits of a reality dating show in the US. Photo: Supplied \nThe average user for each service is a closely guarded secret, so we'd thought we'd dream up our own idea of a typical Netflix and Stan user. Advertisement \nRead on to find out which kind of TV streaming user you are. You're a Netflix user if: \nNetflix is slick and ahead of the curve, just like you. \nOne million Australians subscribe to the service today, but more than 200,000 people accessed Netflix US by using private networks before it was available locally. \nThat's a lot of technically savvy people. \nYou take your streaming and content seriously, which is probably why you signed up for Netflix early in the piece. \nFor you, there is no streaming service but Netflix. Original content is king, and Netflix has it all.

You're a Stan user if: \nYou don't like following the crowd and will tell anyone who listens why Android phones are far superior to iPhones. \nSure, Stan only has 300,000 subscribers, but you know this growing streaming service offers some of the finest shows on television. \nCritically acclaimed shows UnReal , Transparent and Better Call Saul are exclusive to Stan, as well as classics such as Community and Friends. \nWe know. It's pretty cool being able to brag about how great UnReal is while your Netflix-loving friends scratch their heads. \nYou're also a big fan of Australian television, and Stan's new original series No Activity starring Patrick Brammall ticks all the boxes. \nYou don't need the frills in life, you just want functionality. Rebel Wilson dressed as a weird golden mermaid can stay though. \nYou likely work in banking or insurance and already analysed the pros and cons of each of these services in a spreadsheet. \nStan is jointly owned by Fairfax Media and Channel Nine.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T12:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:44:47.432+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
