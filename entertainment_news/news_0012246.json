Trump has responded to the singer's snub, saying in a short statement, \"Good, I don't like his voice or his performances anymore, anyhow!\" While promoting his new album on Wednesday, October 7 in Mexico, Iglesias was asked about the Republican presidential candidate. The Latin icon called Trump a \"clown\" and then apologized to clowns for potentially insulting them. \"I've met Trump three or four times because I've played his places. I think his brain and his heart are not connected right now. It's not correct, his position,\" Iglesias told NY Times. Trump made insulting comments about Mexican immigrants and stood by it. He said during his presidential announcement earlier this year, \"They're not sending you, they're sending people that have lots of problems and they're bringing those problems. They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime. They're rapists and some, I assume, are good people, but I speak to border guards and they're telling us what we're getting.\" Iglesias was among celebrities to boycott Trump after the remark. \"I will never again play in his casinos. I don't want to hurt the immigrants all over the world, and there are many casinos I can play that aren't owned by Mr. Trump,\" he said. Iglesias pointed out that he did not use current events for self-promotion like Trump. He said, \"When I started this album two years ago, I was not thinking I would have something to do with Mr. Trump. I'm 72 years old and I'm maybe the biggest Latino artist in history. If you think that I need that now, that's wrong. At my age, it's too late to embrace situations just to gain something.\" Iglesias' \" Mexico \" was released on September 18. He said it would be his last studio album. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:56:20.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
