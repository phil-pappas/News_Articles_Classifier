The internationally recognised parliament is based in the east and met on Monday to discuss the UN-proposed unity government, lawmaker Ali Tekbali told AFP. \nHowever, he also dismissed the UN plan , saying the government it has proposed is one of “divisions, not unity”. \nThe talks in the eastern-based parliament are to continue on Tuesday, said the Lana news agency. UN special envoy Bernardino Leon “wants to impose a fait accompli on us,” Tekbali said. The Tripoli-based government also rejected the proposal in a statement released late on Sunday. \nOn Friday, Leon proposed a unity government aimed at ending years of conflict in Libya, saying it would be headed by Fayez el-Serraj, a deputy in the Tripoli parliament. It would also include three deputy prime ministers, one each from the west, east and south. \nLeon made the announcement in Morocco after months of tough negotiations with Libyan political players and members of civil society. World leaders and the United Nations have lauded the proposal and urged Libya’s warring parties to sign the deal — the latest in a string of initiatives aimed at restoring stability to the strife-torn country. \n  5:37 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:53:14.681+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
