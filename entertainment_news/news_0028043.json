Sherlock stars Martin Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch (Robert Viglasky/BBC) \nVarious eerie lines teased at the drama to come, including: “Every great causes has martyrs, every war has suicide missions… and make no mistake, this is war.” \nMysteriously, Watson asks Sherlock what made him like this, to which he answers, “Oh Watson, nothing made me. I made me.” How the pair normally look (BBC/Hartswood Films/Robert Viglasky) \nThe previous three series of the show have been set in the modern day, so this will be quite a change for fans. \nWriter Steven Moffat confirmed the standalone special would see the pair back in the 19th century and will have a Victorian “ghost story” feel, but little other details are known. A 90 second trailer for Sherlock,it looks incredible! Bring on the full 90 minutes!! #221Back", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:27:50.449+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
