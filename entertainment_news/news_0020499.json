I'm making up with myself,\" Adele explained on Facebook . \nAdele apologized to fans for the long wait and offered that explanation on how this album is a step forward from her last one. \nJudging by the reaction on Twitter , at least the first song from the album was worth the wait, but Adele's bar is already set pretty high. (Video via USA Today ) \nHer last album, \"21,\" spent 24 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 200 chart, the most for any female artist, not to mention all those Grammys.
