If reviews are any indication, audiences will never, never be seeing \"Pan\" in theaters this weekend.\nThe Warner Bros. film — which acts as a prequel to J.M. Barrie's legendary tale and stars Hugh Jackman, Amanda Seyfried and Rooney Mara — has a paltry 26% rating on Rotten Tomatoes , the film review aggregation site.\n\"Pan\" has generally been criticized for having a rushed plot and \"shrill, CGI-fueled action\" according to their \"Critics Consensus\" feature.\nThe bad reviews don't necessarily mean doom for the feature, especially since it appeals to children, but it helps show just how many adaptations and take-offs and prequels of the Peter Pan mythos there have been.\nHere are some of the most reviled:\n\"Peter Pan Live!\"\nVirginia Sherwood/NBC Allison Williams starred in NBC's \"Peter Pan Live!\" A follow-up to NBC's live production of \"The Sound of Music\" the previous year, \"Peter Pan Live!\" couldn't live up to its predecessor.\n\"Peter Pan\" drew just nine million viewers, compared to \"Sound of Music's\" over 18 million.\nCritics were kinder to \"Pan\" than they were to the Carrie Underwood-starring \"Music,\" with 59% on Rotten Tomatoes , compared to \"Sound of Music's\" 44% .\nBut they generally were unkind to the film, especially Christopher Walken's performance as Captain Hook.\n\"Hook\"\nDustin Hoffman and Robin Williams in scene from the movie \"Hook\". Criticizing \"Hook\" is extremely controversial, as it has a passionate cult audience among viewers who saw it at a young age, but critics tend to thoroughly disagree.\nThe film has only a 30% rating on Rotten Tomatoes (but a 76% audience score, proving the film has its defenders) with the likes of Roger Ebert and Peter Travers slamming the film, which stars Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman.\n\"Hook\" does provide hope for \"Pan,\" however, in that it made $300 million at the box office despite all this.\n\"Return to Neverland\"\nThe sequel's never quite as good in most cases, but one that comes out 50 years after the original has the deck stacked against it.\nA movie that features Peter Pan interacting with Wendy's daughter Jane based off the final chapter of a Barrie novel, \"Return\" drew a 45% rating on Rotten Tomatoes , with the consensus calling it \"forgettable\" and \"lackluster.\"\nThe film also only made $109 million at the box office. Big money, but probably not what the makers of a \"Peter Pan\" sequel had in mind.\nDOWNLOAD OUR NEW AND IMPROVED DAILY NEWS APP FOR ANDROID AND IOS HERE\n\"Neverland\"\nIt seems like every piece of classic fiction gets a \"gritty reboot\" these days, and Peter Pan was no exception when SyFy Network decided to turn it into a miniseries in 2011.\nStarring Rhys Ifans, Bob Hoskins and the voice of Keira Knightley as Tinkerbell, the miniseries focuses on the origin story of Captain Hook.\nIt largely passed by unnoticed, and drew just a 57% rating on Rotten Tomatoes .\nslepore@nydailynews.com", "external_links": ["http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/peter_pan_live/?search=Peter%20Pan%20Live", "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/return_to_never_land/?search=Return%20to%20N", "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hook/?search=Hook", "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/neverland/s01/?search=Neverland", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/ElDagmn9Ba8", "http://nydn.us/app", "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pan_2015/", "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_sound_of_music_live/?search=The%20Sound%20of%20Music%20Live"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:17:40.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
