Furthermore, the carbon fiber reinforced plastic passenger cell found in the latest 7 Series, could also make its way to this upcoming coupe. Another important feature will be the suicide doors borrowed from Phantom, that would be yet another stylish effect. Discussing the cabin, it is pretty obvious that the interior elements of the 7 Series would be seen with even more tweaked quality. Details on: BMW 7 Series When it comes to powertrain, BMW leaves no scope for any kind of shortcoming. That's why, this 9 Series is likely to be offered in petrol, diesel as well as a plug-in hybrid variants. The engine lineup comprises a 3 litre, V6 turbocharged along with a 4.4 litre, V8 twin turbocharged unit. Considering the usual naming strategy of the automaker, the sedans are named in odd numbers, while the coupe ones are given even digits. Hence, it hasn't been clear as to how the name “9 Series” has emerged for this model.
