But the remarkably prolific, widely recorded and eclectic young American Nico Muhly has been part of the public consciousness for more than a decade, dating to when his eclectic, minimalist-influenced music was capturing the ears of critics when he still was a student at the Juilliard School. Detroit got its first taste of Muhly, who also plays piano and works with electronics, when New Music Detroit began championing his music as early as 2007.\nThe Detroit Symphony Orchestra and music director Leonard Slatkin this week give the U.S. premiere of Muhly's Viola Concerto, with the composer's longtime collaborator Nadia Sirota as soloist. Muhly, whose opera \"Two Boys\" was performed in 2013 by the Metropolitan Opera, has attracted a lot of attention not only for his classical music work but also for being conversant with pop music. He has collaborated, for example, with the Detroit-born and Petoskey-raised singer-songwriter Sufjan Stevens and the Brooklyn-based indie rock band Grizzly Bear. The critic and musicologist Will Robin once wrote that Muhly was certainly the only classical composer covered by both BuzzFeed and the New Yorker.\nThe DSO's program also includes Mozart's \"Eine Kleine Nachtmusik (A Little Night Music)\" and Aaron Copland's Symphony No. 3, which is on the short list of great American symphonies. 10:45 a.m. Friday and 3 p.m. Sunday, Orchestra Hall, Max M. Fisher Music Center, 3711 Woodward Ave., Detroit. 313-576-5111. www.dso.org . $15-$50.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nHans Graf, DSO and Beethoven make for a glorious trio\n'La Boheme': Michigan Opera Theatre's season-opening production of Puccini's \"La Boheme\" is more workmanlike than inspired, but conductor Leonardo Vordoni's eloquent work in the pit is a standout, and the singers bring enough craft and feeling to the stage that the opera's lustrous beauty and heartbreaking sentiment still speak. Tenor Sean Panikkar and soprano Nicole Cabell sing the roles of the young lovers Rodolfo and Mimi on Wednesday and Saturday, with Eric Margiore and Lina Tetriani taking over roles on Sunday.\n7:30 p.m. Wednesday and Saturday, 2:30 p.m. Sunday, Detroit Opera House, 1526 Broadway. 313-237-7464. www.michiganopera.org . $29-$149. To read a full review of the production, go here.\nMieczyslaw Weinberg\n: MOT's next production (opening Nov. 14) will be a rare opportunity to hear Mieczyslaw Weinberg's \"The Passenger\" (1968), a Holocaust story by a composer of Polish-Jewish descent who lived in Russia. The opera was suppressed by Soviet authorities, and a fully staged production was not seen until 2010. In anticipation of \"The Passenger,\" Chamber Music at the Scarab Club is presenting a concert devoted mostly to Weinberg's haunting music. In addition, conductor-composer Steven Mercurio, who will be in the pit for MOT's production, will speak about Weinberg and the opera, and the concert will include a new quartet by Mercurio written for clarinet, violin, cello and piano.\n7:30 p.m. Thursday, Scarab Club, 217 Farnsworth, Detroit. 519-252-0212. www.scarabclub.org . $18-$22.\nJAZZ The fleet-fingered Philadelphia-born bassist Christian McBride has been a longtime favorite of Detroit audiences, who recognize a kindred Detroit spirit in his deep ties to the bebop tradition, allegiance to the groove and gregarious personality. McBride forged a close relationship with the city as artist-in-residence of the Detroit Jazz Festival back in 2008, and every time he returns to Motown it feels a bit like a family reunion. This time out, he opens the DSO's Paradise Jazz Series by leading his big band, a hard-swinging aggregation stocked with top New Yorkers. As a value-added element, the classical bass virtuoso Edgar Meyer, who has an ear for vernacular styles, has joined the bill to go head to head with McBride. Look out!\n8 p.m. Friday, Orchestra Hall, Max M. Fisher Music Center, 3711 Woodward Ave., Detroit. 313-576-5111. www.dso.org . $19-$60.\nContact Mark Stryker: 313-222-6459 or mstryker@freepress.com", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4ad9e14f66aa868719cc69d9668dfb90551746dd/c=82-0-1864-1782/local/-/media/2015/10/17/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635806987327029851-Graf-Conducting.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T22:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:20:22.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
