There are two other undefeated teams in No. 3 Pittsford, and last year’s defending class champion, Victor. All three teams are 7-0, which could make for exciting matchups in the semifinals and final. All three teams play an opponent in the first round with a record above .500.\nFourth-seeded Hilton could be a team to upset the potential undefeated matchups. The Cadets are 6-1, with their only loss coming to Victor, 42-34, less than two weeks ago.\nClass A\nBrockport (No. 1) and Canandaigua (No. 2) are the top seeds in Class A. Brockport defeated Canandaigua 33-28 back on Sept. 11.\nNo. 3 Greece Athena plays No. 6 Irondequoit in the first round. The Eagles are the lower seed but defeated the Trojans 35-14 in Week 6.\nClass B\nBatavia played a mixed schedule between RCAC schools and Finger Lakes schools, resulting in an undefeated regular season and a No. 1 seed.\nThe Blue Devils’ top competition will be No. 2 Livonia, whose only loss came against an undefeated Bath team. However, the Bulldogs have dominated in their six wins, scoring 50 points per game while allowing 11.\nClass C\nThis class will have an exciting finals matchup if the top seeds make it there. No. 1 East Rochester/Gananda and No. 2 Bath are each undefeated and neither team was challenged much in their respective leagues.\nBoth teams got stronger as the year went on and they would each be the best team the other has played all year in the championship.\nClass D\nThey have something that only Class AA also has: All eight teams in the tournament are above .500. In fact, only No. 8 Dundee has a record worse than 5-2. Top-seeded Red Jacket and No. 2 Avon both enter the postseason without a loss but they will have heavy competition to make it to the final.\nThe team to watch out for is No. 5 Bishop Kearney. The Kings went 5-2 in their first season as an independent, with their only game against a Section V opponent all year being a 30-15 win over Batavia Notre Dame in Week 5.\nThe finals for all five classes will take place on the weekend of Nov. 7 and 8 at Sahlen’s Stadium.\nClass AA quarterfinals\nFriday: No. 7 Webster Thomas (4-3) at No. 2 Victor (7-0), No. 5 East (5-2) at No. 4 Hilton (6-1), 7 p.m.; No. 6 Rush-Henrietta (4-3) at No. 3 Pittsford (7-0), 7:30 p.m.\nSaturday: No. 8 Fairport (4-3) at No. 1 Aquinas (7-0), 7 p.m.\nClass A quarterfinals\nFriday: No. 8 Wilson (3-4) at No. 1 Brockport (6-1), 7 p.m.\nSaturday: No. 7 Spencerport (3-4) at No. 2 Canandaigua (5-2), No. 6 Irondequoit (4-3) at No. 3 Greece Athena (5-2), No. 5 Eastridge (4-3) at No. 4 Greece Arcadia (5-2), 2 p.m.\nClass B quarterfinals\nFriday: No. 8 Midlakes (2-5) at No. 1 Batavia (7-0), No. 5 Newark (4-3) at No. 4 Hornell (5-2), No. 6 Penn Yan (4-3) at No. 3 Geneva (5-2), No. 7 Palmyra-Macedon (2-5) at No. 2 Livonia (6-1), 7:30 p.m.\nClass C quarterfinals\nFriday: No. 8 South Seneca (3-4) at No. 1 East Rochester/Gananda (7-0), No. 6 Le Roy (4-3) at No. 3 Attica (6-1), No. 5 Elba/Byron-Bergen (5-2) at No. 4 Lyons/Sodus (5-2), 7 p.m.\nSaturday: No. 7 Letchworth/Warsaw (3-4) at No. 2 Bath (7-0), 1 p.m.\nClass D quarterfinals\nFriday: No. 6 Notre Dame (5-2) at No. 3 Clyde-Savannah (6-1), 7 p.m.; No. 5 Bishop Kearney (5-2) at No. 4 Cuba-Rushford (6-1), No. 7 Caledonia-Mumford (5-2) vs. No. 2 Avon (7-0) at Honeoye Falls-Lima, 7:30 p.m.\nSaturday: No. 8 Dundee (4-3) at No. 1 Red Jacket (7-0), 1:30 p.m.\nFinals at Sahlen’s Stadium\nClass AA: Sunday, Nov. 8, 4 p.m.\nClass A: Saturday, Nov. 7, 6 p.m.\nClass B: Sunday, Nov. 8, 1 p.m.\nClass C: Saturday, Nov. 7, 3 p.m.\nClass D: Saturday, Nov. 7, 12 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T06:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:01:53.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
