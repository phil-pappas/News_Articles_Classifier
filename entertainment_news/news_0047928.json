For a ‘big bang’ to create all this is more wild to think about than thinking about there being a God. Imagine putting a bunch of gold into a box, shaking up the box, and out comes a Rolex. It’s so preposterous once people start saying it.\"\nAs Bieber puts, he's \"the type of dude who always wants to figure it out.\" Rest assured, the scientific mind that is Justin Bieber is working on a new theory that will baffle the scientific community and revolutionise how we view the galaxy around us.\nWe're guessing Neil DeGrasse-Tyson, Brian Cox and all those lads over at CERN are just packing it in now and going on the dole instead. Maybe Brian Cox will reform D:Ream, who knows.\nVia The Guardian\nMORE: Xander from Buffy The Vampire Slayer's been arrested again for allegedly ''choking'' his girlfriend\nMORE: Robin Williams' daughter posted a beautiful message about dealing with depression on Instagram\nMORE: Antonio Banderas is going to fashion school so he can make men's capes a thing again", "external_links": ["https://media.giphy.com/media/3o85xzqxvDsyiwIYSs/giphy.gif", "http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2015/oct/01/justin-bieber-debunks-big-bang-theory?CMP=EMCNEWEML6619I2"], "published": "2015-10-04T04:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T05:59:15.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
