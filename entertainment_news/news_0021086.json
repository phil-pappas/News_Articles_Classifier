Furthermore it has warmth and the Nancy Meyers urban catalogue of great looking interiors. However to say it is a great movie, would, I am afraid be padding the envelope a bit. Robert De Niro plays Ben Whittaker a seventy year old retired hard working telephone book executive, living in Brooklyn who sees a sign for “senior” interns and decides to apply to an internet start-up that has seen phenomenal success in a short amount of time. Company founder Jules Ostin, played by Anne Hathaway is at first skeptical of the senior internship program, and specifically when Whittaker is hired, of Ben himself, as he appears to be too “observant.” Is there something in her personal life she wants to hide, or does she just fear scrutiny? However Ben, whose character is just a bit too perfect, has too much to offer as a guardian angel, Fairy God Father, and loyal companion for Jules to turn down a good thing. She needs a wise, warm, employee to guide her, and like magic he is there. Much of the charm of The Intern comes from the chemistry between De Niro and Hathaway. Both of these Oscar winning actors give genuine, warm performances. It is so good to see De Niro in a low key, but totally credible role. He is so immensely likeable, but totally credible as a character that feels a little too good to be true sometimes. He is finally choosing good roles in good films again ( Silver Linings Playbook comes to mind) after years of seemingly bad choices that squandered his talented and just seemed like a means to a paycheck. Hathaway is great here. An actress that faced bizarre backlash after her astonishing Oscar winning performance in Les Miserables, she proves again that she is a terrific, skilled performer. So good is Hathaway that during an important, moving monologue late in the film she actually breaks out in a rash, when she gets emotional. There’s authenticity for you. Filmmaker Meyers touches on some interesting and intelligent details about women bosses. For example, everyone assumes Jules is difficult just because she is a woman, and a woman must be bitchy to have gotten into a position of power; not so. Also apparently it is okay for women to cry at work, and this doesn’t diminish their strength or competency in any way. Some women cry as a coping mechanism and it actually grounds them so they can move on. I was put off by this at first, thinking, “how can a women writer/director present women characters crying at work,” especially because I have had women bosses (I prefer them) most of my life and have never seen them cry. Then again, they wouldn’t do in front of an employee. Because The Intern is written by a women, it makes this scenario, not only more credible, but more palpable. All the supporting cast is great and feels like real people, although Anders Holm as Jules, sweet unassuming house husband, Matt, seems a bit too frumpy, lumpy and hairy to be married to such a successful gorgeous woman like Jules (Hathaway’s skin is luminous, and she is phenomenally photogenic). However, again, there is perhaps a statement in his casting as well; women want the sweet, considerate, supportive guy, not necessarily the sexy, good-looking, bad boy. (spoiler alert) In any event, Matt is not the perfect husband after all. Although there are a lot of great things about The Intern , there are some sloppy plot devices and the ending is just too neat; tied with a bow. For a film that presents the idea of being a woman executive as complicated, the film isn’t complicated enough, and lacks edges when it needs it. However, I liked this film much better than Meyers last three films as director [ It’s Complicated (2009), Something’s Gotta Give (2003) and The Holiday (2006)] as it feels more complete and less contrived. Meyers gets a bad rep with critics, and I hate to get on that band wagon. I love some of her early comedies as a writer, notably Private Benjamin and Baby Boom and again I want to herald her as someone who writes great women characters, and her films always have a strong moral compass. Perhaps I just can’t get past the fact that many years ago, when I was an assistant for a powerful entertainment lawyer in Los Angeles, who represented Meyers, that Meyers was incredibly rude to me, when I complimented her about one of her films. She didn’t deign to speak to the assistant. Yes I need to let go of this, and it is great that she writes women bosses that are nice, perhaps she is now too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T15:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:04:54.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
