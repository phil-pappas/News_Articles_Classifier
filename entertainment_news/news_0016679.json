(Photo: Universal Studios) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nLike the iconic man who is associated with revolutionizing the tech history, ‘Steve Jobs’ is brilliant. With a unique and fast-paced style of storytelling, powerful acting, wit, and an over-dramatic and exaggerated script, this film delivers the story behind the man with an amazing ability to imagine products that would change the world. \nWritten by Aaron Sorkin, directed by Danny Boyle, and starring Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen and Jeff Daniels; audiences will walk away feeling pity, amused, in awe of and even dislike and distain for the man in the black turtleneck and horn-rimmed glasses. \nThe film is partially based on Walter Isaacson’s book, also named “Steve Jobs”, as well as interviews Sorkin conducted with a few of those closest to Jobs when he was still alive. The interviews including Apple Co-Founder, Steve Wozniak; marketing executive and Jobs’ right hand woman, Joanna Hoffman; Apple CEO, John Sculley; original Mac team developer, Andy Hertzfeld; Jobs’ daughter, Lisa Brennan-Jobs and her mother, Chrisann Brennan. \n‘Steve Jobs’ is basically split up into three lengthy scenes, each one taking place right before three important events, the product launches that span over more than 16 years in Jobs’ career. The first event is the unveiling of the original Mac Computer, set in 1984 in Cupertino, CA. The second event is the launch of Jobs’ NeXT Computer in 1988, and the third event is the release of the iMac in 1998. \nRecently, I had the chance to sit down with Sorkin and discuss various aspects of the movie, and unlike previous portrayals of Jobs and instead of primarily focusing on the cool gadgets and innovative technology, Sorkin wanted to highlight the larger truths and deeper issues regarding Jobs - his friends, his daughter, their relationships etc. Sorkin admits that while much of the dialogue and conversations that take place in the film are fictional and exaggerated, the content of those conversations and confrontations between characters did exist. \nSorkin stresses that this film is not a biopic or documentary, and that he believe that he created “a painting, not a photography”. He states, “it’s not a piece of journalism, it’s a piece of art, which gives me permission to do a subjective impressionistic take on what’s going on. ” This means that while he won’t necessarily lie to tell the story, certain manipulation, exaggeration, and dramatization is needed to make this kind of film. He did take the time to consult the major people being portrayed in the film, aside from Jobs, and received major feedback. \nScreenwriter Aaron Sorkin was recently in Dallas to help promote 'Steve Jobs.' (Photo: Hayden Pittman, WFAA Special Contributor) \nFassbender gives a commanding performance as Steve Jobs, while Winslet’s Joanna Hoffman is a very powerful woman who holds Jobs together. Seth Rogen, as Steve Wozniak, plays a kind and brainy friend and partner to Jobs, Jeff Daniels is a strong John Sculley, and Michael Stuhlbarg, who looks slightly different than normal so as to fit his role, plays Andy Hertzfeld, a member of the original Macintosh team and tech nerd. Katherine Waterston is seen briefly as Chrisann Brennan, Jobs’ former girlfriend and mother of his daughter, and Jobs’ daughter, Lisa, changes actresses throughout the film. There are a few other recognizable actors, such as John Ortiz, playing a journalist; and along with Fassbender, most main supporting actors give notable performances. \nIf you can imagine the speed of thoughts and ideas running through Steve Job's brain, the film mimics it with constant rhetoric and a fast-moving style that often comes off very chaotic at times, switching from one topic, conversation, event, or flashbacks to another. Heated discussions between Jobs, his daughter and major colleagues before every product launch help piece together the man Steve Jobs truly was, arrogant, cold, ruthless, detached, and at the same time all-inspiring, loyal, determined, and a genius. But at what cost is the real question that \"Steve Jobs\" brings to light. \n‘Steve Jobs’ is well written, well acted, well directed, and is in full speed from start to finish. Watching this movie, I felt like I had gotten to follow Jobs around before one of his events or spend just a few minutes with him. \nFunny enough, the film went through a good amount of casting changes, and although Fassbender doesn’t resemble Steve Jobs in almost any way physically, his grasp on the character Sorkin created is apparently unmatched. While this version of the Steve Jobs story doesn’t cover too much about the tech genius, Sorkin has proven that his specific interpretation is one to be recognized. \n4 out of 5 stars. \n‘Steve Jobs’ is rated R for language. Running time is 2 hours and 2 minutes.
