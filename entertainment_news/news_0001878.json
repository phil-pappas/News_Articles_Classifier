After teasing that there could be two seasons of \" American Horror Story \" in 2016, the series co-creator said at EW Fest that he already had two ideas for the next installment. While Murphy didn't share any details about his ideas, Evan Peters recently revealed he pitched an \"American Horror Story\" season set in space. However, Murphy wasn't into the idea as he insisted that it's \"American Horror Story\", not \"Intergalactic Horror Story.\" Murphy also said he had two ideas for the next season of \" American Crime Story \", while the freshman season \"The People v. O.J. Simpson\" has yet to air. As for \" Scream Queens \", the idea for the possible season 2 has been approved. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T04:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T11:09:51.979+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
