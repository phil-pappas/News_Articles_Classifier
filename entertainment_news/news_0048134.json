When Knightley didn't respond, the man yelled, \"Five seconds is too long to wait for a response!\" An usher escorted the man away, but as security arrived the guy picked up a bouquet of flowers and threw them at the actors. \nThe New York Police Department detained the man. \nRoundabout Theatre Company, which operates the Studio 54 Theatre, declined to elaborate but provided a statement to ABC Radio. \"Roundabout takes the safety of their actors and audiences very seriously and extra security will be added beginning tonight. For obvious reasons, we cannot comment on the exact nature of the additional security measures,\" the statement read. \nThe venue is the same that was staging a performance of Cabaret last year when actor Shia LaBeouf was escorted out and subsequently arrested after shouting obscenities at the actors on stage. \nThérèse Raquin, also starring former Who's the Boss? star Judith Light, will run through January 3, 2016. \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
