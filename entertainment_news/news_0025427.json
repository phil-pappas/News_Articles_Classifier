I do not want to order that fight on Pay-Per-View) and two accidental hang-ups, I got a helpful woman who started a game of how-low-can-we-go to-keep-your-business. \nI explained we were no longer willing to pay that much for cable. \nRight off the bat, the rep knocked off $20 a month for basic digital service with a \"special promo.\" After I complained about paying $12 a month for digital adapters, which is how Comcast delivers service (why should I pay for that?), she gave me a one-time $70 credit. \nWithin 15 minutes, she slashed $450 so I would only pay closer to $700 a year for service. \nCall back next month, she said, and the company will lower the monthly bill another 10 bucks. Cha-ching: Another potential $120 in annual savings. \nI was retained as a customer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T19:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:18:00.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
