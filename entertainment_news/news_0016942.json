As \"Back to the Future\" co-writer and producer Bob Gale explains, the car was an unconventional choice, even by Hollywood standards. \"When we were working on the movie, the company's founder, John DeLorean, was on trial for cocaine trafficking -- he was in the news pretty much every day -- and then, of course, his company went bust. \"But to us, there was something dangerous, something counterculture, something so very gorgeous about just how beautiful that car was. And we loved those gull-wing doors.\" Read More The car in question, the 1981 DeLorean DMC-12, would be the only automobile ever to be built by the DeLorean Motor Co. Manufactured in a suburb of Belfast, in Northern Ireland, and primarily for the American market, only 9,000 were made before production ceased in 1982. Of these, an estimated 6,000 remain. DeLoreans out for a spin Today, DeLorean owners the world over will be showered with extra attention. October 21, 2015, is the date to which Marty and Doc travel 30 years forward in time in the second installment of the movie franchise -- and the expected fanfare (think Enchantment Under the Sea dances and interactive screenings) would be amiss without the presence of the film's time-traveling ride. Chris Parnham, author of the book \"Delorean: Celebrating the Impossible,\" considers the movie to be a key reason behind the car's enduring popularity. \"Unlike, say, a really expensive Ferrari or Lamborghini, with the DeLorean, people don't get jealous. They won't take out their keys and scratch it. People, especially young people, have really fond memories of it from 'Back to the Future.' \" Parnham, who is also a member of the DeLorean Owners Club UK (DOC), has owned and recommissioned 18 DeLoreans since buying one in 1999. He offers them to members at cost price and currently owns two. \"I can't pretend I'm a shrinking violet,\" he said with a laugh of the crowds that usually form around his sleek low-silhouette ride. \"I enjoy the attention.\" Welcome, 'Back to the Future' day Not content with simply owning a DeLorean, some, such as 51-year-old Japanese entrepreneur Michihiko Iwamoto, have taken it to the next level. Iwamoto plans to spend the day driving his time-machine replica in a parking lot in Tokyo, where he will demonstrate how his very own Doc Brown-inspired \"Mr. Fusion Home Energy Reactor\" runs on bioethanol made from recycled clothes. \"I love it,\" Iwamoto said. \"When I sit in the driver's seat and hold the steering wheel, I feel transported back to my youth.\" JUST WATCHED", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T17:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:46:02.651+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
