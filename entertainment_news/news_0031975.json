At the time, Sternheim was considered to be a master of stylized comedy, and given what we've seen of so much of Martin's comedy over several decades, it's no wonder that he might be drawn to a property of this sort for adapting purposes. \nBasically, if you're familiar with Steve Martin's brand of humor, you'll appreciate where this one is going, despite its very foreign environs of Dusseldorf, Germany, circa 1911. In fact, the whole play has such a \"Martinesque\" quirkiness to it that I imagined that all six characters, plus the king (presumably Kaiser Wilhelm II), could have been played to great advantage by Martin himself. \nDirected by Bill Fennelly, this exceptionally skilled ensemble of Michael Brian Dunn (Ben Cohen), Marianna McClellan (Louise Maske), Tuck Milligan (Klingelhoff), Daniel Passer (Versati, the King), Sabrina Profitt (Gertrude Deuter), and Mark David Watson (Theo Maske) demonstrates the kind of (seemingly) off-the cuff versatility necessary to bring off the zaniness in this out-of-sync series of situations. \nLouise, the wife of proud, middle-level clerk Theo, experiences a wardrobe malfunction while watching a passing parade. In an effort to get a better view while waving at the passing king, Louise's underpants manage to slip down around her ankles as she stretches for greater height. Convinced that no one saw the act (\"Everybody was looking at the king, not at me.\") she is somewhat nonchalant about the situation as she explains it to her husband, who goes off the wall, fearing ridicule, embarrassment, and worse yet, possibly getting fired from his job. This situation sets off a series of encounters among characters who have been drawn to the Maske household due to the parade proceedings. \nChief among the visitors is Versati, a roguish sort with a quick tongue, fancy manners, and a desire to woo the lady who had put on quite the display at the parade. Passer's character is fun to watch as he devises a series of disingenuous machinations to attain his rather salacious purposes. \nDunn and Milligan, as Cohen and Klingelhoff, respectively, are bewildered, older men who respond to an advertisement to rent a room in the Maske home, and plunge into the morass of confusion created around the underpants incident that is further exacerbated by Theo's fears of no longer being a member of the proud middle class. \nProfitt's Gertrude, a nosy neighbor, is a joy to watch as she manipulates much of the confusion, while often tipping off the audience with subtle facial expression and staccato physicality. \nPlayed upon a single, very well-ordered set design by William Bloodgood, the characters (like in most uproarious farces), enter and exit by way of several doors leading to hallways and bedrooms, and scene changes are cued by a bevy of German folk dancers who bounce about the stage to the accompaniment of Teutonic dance music, hand clapping, flag waving, and even, yes, yodeling! \nAmong the more interesting aspects of the piece is the unsubtle social satire that's hardly buried beneath the chaos, quick-witted commentary, numerous, somewhat naughty, double entendres, and the well-directed and executed physical comedy that's filled with sight gags and even comic sexual simulations. \nIt's often been said that good tragedy is \"easier\" to execute than good comedy, and I think that's because tragedy is more universal, and comedy, or comic tastes, are more individual. I thought about those ideas as I witnessed a theater full of out-and-out laughter as I sat admiring the cleverness of the situations and the comic sensibilities and movements of the actors that prompted my few smirks and smiles. \nAs a side thought, once a \"one-act\" piece goes over the 90-minute length, I think an intermission is in order someplace earlier. I realize that the writing and the action dictate \"natural\" breaks, however, one hour and fifty minutes is a very long sitting for many patrons to retain concentration. \nThe Details Length of Performance : Approx. 1 hour, 50 minutes with no intermission. Attendance : Full-house on opening night. Family Guide : OK for mature high school age. Contains several sexual themes, references, and simulations.
