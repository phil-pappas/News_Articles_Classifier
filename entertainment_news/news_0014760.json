Just show up with some bags and take what you'd like, organizers said. \nFurniture and other large items are not accepted at the swap. \nThe not-for-profit's events are held throughout the city, with the goal of having them in each of the 59 community districts every year. \n“Stop ‘N’ Swaps keep reusable items from ending up in a landfill and prevent the waste that comes from the production, packaging and transportation required to get new things,” said GrowNYC Executive Director Marcel Van Ooyen. \nWhatever is left at the event on Sunday will be donated or recycled. \nP.S. 330 is located at 110-08 Northern Blvd., Corona.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T16:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:04:36.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
