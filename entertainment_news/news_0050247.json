(Photo: Richard Cartwright, The WB) \nAll Gilmore Girls lovers can't help but fondly remember nights at Luke's Diner and the countless -- and often strange -- celebrations in the cutest town ever, Star's Hollow. Even awkward dinners with Emily and Richard feel like they were just yesterday. But it was actually 15 years ago, if you can believe it. \nIn honor of 15 years spent re-watching old box sets of our favorite mother-daughter duo, here are 15 times we wished we were a Gilmore girl: 1. The extremely one-sided Star Wars debate 2. When Jess came in clutch with the umbrella 3. When Lorelai talked through her writer's block 4. And when Lorelai sang her painting song 5. When Rory \"got hit by a deer\" 6. When Star's Hollow had a 24-hour dance marathon 7. And when Rory and Lorelai totally rigged the snowman competition 8. When drunk Sookie met a deep-fried Thanksgiving 9. The deep, deep love for coffee 10. When Star's Hollow had the Festival of Living Art 11. When Luke showed Lorelai the old horoscope and our hearts melted 12. And when Max gave her 1,000 yellow daisies 13. When Rory jumps (and we held our breath) 14. When this FINALLY happens 15. And most importantly, every pizza and/or Chinese takeout order made with zero weight gain Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1Lex7Zs Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T00:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:58:27.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
