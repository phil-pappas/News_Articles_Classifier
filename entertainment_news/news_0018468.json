His fans included the Czech Republic's first post-communist leader Vaclav Havel, who made him an unofficial cultural ambassador.\nNeil Portnow, president of the Recording Academy, which awarded Frank Zappa two Grammys, mourned Gail as a \"creative, independent-minded woman.\"\nArts & Entertainment Media Frank Zappa Gail Zappa", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:56:48.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
