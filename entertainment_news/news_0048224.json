Lafayette and a consignment shop at 103 N. Lafayette there is a hidden door. If you blink, you might miss it. It’s a black door with a narrow staircase just behind it. Overhead, a hand-painted sign that reads, \"Speakeasy Studio.\" At the top of the narrow stairs, the first thing you see is a six-foot tall face of a Native American smiling, painted in brilliant blues and dusky purples. Sketches of all shapes and sizes fill the studio walls. Speakeasy Studio is a collaborative project between Randy Mach, Joshua Lee, Nick Carpenter and other local artists. The grand opening for the studio is scheduled for Thursday, which coincides with the Cleveland County Arts Council and the Uptown Shelby Association Uptown Art Walk, which features local artists at venues around the city. The goals of the art walk and Speakeasy Studios are similar - bring the community together around local art. “We wanted something different,” Mach said. “Walking around Shelby, you see many young artists selling their stuff out of a suitcase. We are trying to give a place for these guys.” “It also came out of necessity,” Lee said. Both Lee and Mach stated that they hope to make Speakeasy a community spot where everyone can enjoy creating art. “We want to build a good foundation for artists,” Lee said. “We want to make it a place for anyone to just come and paint, sculpt, write or just hang out.” The studio is broken up into different rooms. The first room is adorn with collaborative pieces. There is work space in the main studio, while the main gallery is to its right. The studio displays this collaborative effort. “First, we thought about each of us having our own wall, and then we thought, 'let’s just put them all together,'” Mach said. Speakeasy plans to use another smaller room in the gallery for artists to rent - to work or display their pieces. It will also be used for larger, community art pieces. “Everybody needs a creative day. We want to nurture a creative community,” Lee said.
