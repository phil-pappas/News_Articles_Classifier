In 2010, promoter \"Dancing Tony\" Susco raised the idea of resurrecting Uncle Joe's annual Halloween covers party as a fundraiser for the Harsimus Cemetery (which is entirely supported by donations,) and the show has become an annual tradition and a highlight of the Jersey City arts calendar. The audience is encouraged to come in costume and the entire event becomes one of the best Halloween parties in the area. \nThis year, local musicians will do sets as Wilco, The Grateful Dead, Soundgarden, Hall & Oates, Kiss, the Misfits, the Modern Lovers, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Madonna, and Led Zeppelin, beginning at 1:50 pm and running to around 10 pm. \nBut that's not all: Two after parties will keep the party rockin' at LITM and Porta Lounge when people leave the cemetery, followed by a \"Mischief Night\" party at Lucky 7 on Friday, October 30 and a \"Party In The Plaza\" at Grove Street Plaza on Halloween Day from 6 to 10 pm. \nDylan Scalora will be one of the musicians from JC Studios who will recreate the Red Hot Chili Peppers at the cemetery. \"Uncle Joe's is a special thing, to put it simply,\" he said. \"We were lucky to play as the Smashing Pumpkins last year. The audience sang along, and I was able to live out the rock star fantasy of playing in my favorite band. I am grateful for another chance to play!\" \nScalora said he's even more excited to perform as the funky Chili Peppers this year. \"The Chili Peppers are much more kinetic in their music and energy, and I have partied to these songs for years,\" he said. \"I am stoked to try and bring that party to the people! \nBut even more than the music, all of these musicians have come to value the meaning and beauty of the cemetery, which is one of Jersey City's most historic landmarks. \"It's a really great way to support Harsimus!\" Scalora enthused. \"Being super afraid of ghosts and such as a kid, I never thought I would spend as much time in a cemetery - much less with my children! We watch the goats trim the grass, attend movie showings, and look forward to their many communal offerings.\" \nCasey O'Donnell will join Scalora in the Chili Peppers. \"The Ghost of Uncle Joe's is such an incredible event,\" he enthused. \"My first attendance was two years ago and I was blown away by everybody's support for the Harsimus Cemetery! It's a genius idea really. Who doesn't want to dress up as their favorite band, in a cemetery, playing for an excited audience, all for a good cause? It's a win/win situation. The show has become a very special event and one that I look forward to every year.\" \nThe Ghost of Uncle Joe's is even more important to Neil McAneny, who's been living in Jersey City long enough to remember the real Uncle Joe's. He's also the sound engineers who works many local events like Groove On Grove. \n\"Our band is actually made up entirely of people who worked at Uncle Joe's at one point or another so it's no secret why this is so important to me,\" McAneny said. :What's great about the show itself is seeing how well the bands pull this off. It's a lot of fun seeing your friends get up there and take on different personas for the show. Over the years there have been some pretty epic performances.\" \n\"I remember when Tony told me he wanted to move this from 58 Coles to the cemetery and thinking, 'well, this certainly has amazing potential,'\" he continued. \"That first show in 2010 is when I first met Eileen (Markenstein) and got to really know what it was that she and her volunteers were taking on. She's preserving a piece of JC history that was literally abandoned. This city could really use more people like that these days. I'm just glad we all get to help in that process.\" \nMcAneny and his friends will be reprising Lodi, New Jersey's horror-punk legends, the Misfits. \"Picking the Misfits, truth be told, when I saw the initial lineup I noticed a complete lack of evil to it,\" he explained. \"Then a few days later, Billy Alpha suggested we bring the Misfits back. Seemed like a good idea as it will be the five year anniversary of doing Halloween shows in the cemetery and we played that first show.\" \n\"The Misfits for Halloween in a cemetery...it's kind of a no brainer.\" \nGlenn Morrow, the owner of Hoboken's Bar None Records who recently introduced a new band called Cry For Help at Groove On Grove, will be making his first appearance at Ghost of Uncle Joe's as Lovin' Spoonful at the LITM after-party. \n\"I love the idea of a mixed use cemetery,\" Morrow said. \"It¹s not just for the dead anymore! Plus it¹s the place where Dancing Tony delivered his award winning performance in the Front Bottoms 'Help' video.\" \n\"The Lovin' Spoonful were the original indie rockers,\" Morrow continued. \"delivering the hits for the Kama Sutra label in the 1960s. Their lead singer John Sebastian is one of the great songwriters of his time and doesn¹t get the respect he deserves.\" \nHere is the complete lineup for all of the Ghost of Uncle Joe's shows. Proceeds from each event will go to support the Historic Jersey City & Harsimus Cemetery. \nSaturday, October 24 - HNJ&H Cemetery , 435 Newark Avenue, JerseyCity \nGates at 1pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:46:11.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
