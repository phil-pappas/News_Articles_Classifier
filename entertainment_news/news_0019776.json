You haven’t? Well it’s exactly what happened to BBC Breakfast presenter Naga Munchetty. \nThe host was midway through a segment about the ‘Spectre’ film, when for no apparent reason, she said the ‘7 Days’ hitmaker’s name instead of Daniel Craig ’s. Whoopsie. Craig David is James Bond! Lol. #bbcbreakfast pic.twitter.com/JVHAFJ0rnN \n— Ben Grafton (@BenGrafton) October 22, 2015 \nAh, the simple things that are always the funniest, dontcha think? \nNaga’s slip-up has got us thinking though, and while Craig is currently busy staging a comeback to end all comebacks, we reckon he’d make a dashing 007. \nBond enjoys some downtime before fighting baddies or doing whatever it is he does \nEver the professional, Naga quickly moved on following her mistake and managed to make it through the rest of the interview unscathed, before presumably returning to her dressing room and playing 'Rendezvous'. \nOf course, Naga isn't the first presenter to make a live on TV, and Bill Turnbull made a rather huge mistake earlier this year, when he accidentally dropped the C-bomb .
