It’s always been jukebox musicals — a bit of acting then a song — so this has been an awesome process, but difficult at the same time because I can’t read music, but it has really all fallen into place,” Donovan says.\nAre the constant challenges a deliberate strategy for the 27-year-old?\n“I think it has been a little bit conscious, because people go, ‘Why don’t you try this?’ and I think about whether it’s something I would want to do, and there are lots of other things that come into play, too, like what I’m doing as Casey in the music world,” she says.\nOther Stories The horror of MH17’s final 90 seconds News 0 comments Who were Playboy’s Aussie stars?

Picture: Chris Pavlich In the meantime, there’s Rent, which features a cast of 14 and a five-piece band.\n“It’s just been amazing so far and this is tech week and we have an audience, so I was just looking through the run sheet and I thought, ‘Shit, this just got real’,” she says with a laugh.\nWritten by Jonathan Larson (who died before it opened) in the late 1980s and set in the final days of that decade and the first of the next, Rent premiered on Broadway in 1996 and became one of the few musicals in history to win a Pulitzer Prize.\nBased on Puccini’s opera La Boheme (which first hit the stage almost exactly 100 years before Rent opened), and inspired by Larson’s own experiences, the musical tells the story of a bunch of young creative types eking out a living in Manhattan’s East Village.\nBesides dealing with rent and tenancy issues, several of the characters are also trying to cope with being HIV-positive and what that meant before drugs to manage the virus were developed.\n“Obviously it’s a response to the HIV epidemic but its themes of celebrating life and living a life full of passion and love are as relevant today as they were in the 1990s, as they were when La Boheme was written in the 1890s,” says director Shaun Rennie.\n“My challenge was ‘How do I get an audience to hear these themes afresh?’ ”\nTo get the young cast — including Heathers breakout star Stephen Madsen, Laura Bunting, Loren Hunter and Donovan — connecting with the material, Rennie has had speakers visit to talk about issues around HIV in Australia, and he’s also introduced a phone ban in the rehearsal room.\n“Our phones get put on aeroplane mode when we’re inside,” confirms Donovan. “It’s that thing of going back to the way it was.”\nIt’s been a big year for debuts at Hayes, with this Rennie’s first outing as director. He’s best known as a musical-theatre performer, seen in the likes of Mary Poppins and Cats, but now joins fellow performers Helen Dallimore and Trevor Ashley, who have already made their directorial debuts, as well as Mitchell Butel, who is helming Violet at the Hayes in November.\n“This space here at the Hayes allows us to try new things and spread our wings as theatre-makers, and try to really reconnect with the material in a way an audience hasn’t seen before,” Rennie says.\n“It has been exciting to go back to Rent and look at when it was written and why it was written.”\nTwitter: @EpicChook\n● Rent, Hayes Theatre Co, 19 Greenknowe Ave, Potts Point; until November 1, adult $59, conc $54, 8065 7337, hayestheatre.com", "external_links": ["http://www.hayestheatre.com.au/", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f7af86b55a97a468a32d46c49ee9f39c?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/47d0ba3dcfc7d0e1945efb38c38f5fd8", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c425d8e603a72200be1a612f0e2f9ce2", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/29aa8c9e7df2fc3d60f1cedc5efbb1b7", "https://twitter.com/EpicChook", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/4239c7afe20d17751cdd8315329319d8", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0b6982a1678b0da22950bcaee37eaf7c", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c80d0385f326782e548c83e83205d9f1", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-10-12T14:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:08:38.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
