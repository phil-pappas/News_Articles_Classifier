The organisation is America’s largest mentoring network and matches adult volunteers with children and teenagers. \nSpeaking on the red carpet in Beverly Hills, Rory said: “This is our first foray out of the house, we have been in sweats and t-shirts for five weeks crying, it is surreal. \n“To be in this position where she is being honoured and we can accept the award on her behalf is very special, we definitely feel her with us.” Jackie and her sister Joan on the Graham Norton Show (Yui Mok/PA) \nTiffany added: “It’s very bittersweet, she was such a pioneer and she was so incredible, and the outpouring of love and support we have received since she’s gone is unbelievable. \n“It’s so heart-warming to us and makes us feel so good to know how loved she was by everybody. \n“She would be so honoured, we are just sad she can’t be here to see it but we know she will always be with us.” Jackie picks up her OBE from the Queen in 2013 (Dominic Lipinski/PA) \nCollins, who is the younger sister of actress Joan, was born in London but moved to Los Angeles in the 1960s. \nHer best-selling novels, including Hollywood Wives, Chances, Lucky and Hollywood Husbands, won her legions of fans and Rory said those fans have been a source of comfort to her family. \nShe added: “She was very connected to her fans. After someone dies you wonder if they knew how loved they were but she had such a lovely relationship with her readers, it comforts us to know how loved she was. Jackie – flanked by her granddaughters – shows off her OBE (John Stillwell/PA) \n“Given the opportunity, she would have kept writing until she was 100 years old.
