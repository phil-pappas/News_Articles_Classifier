Lancaster-based panel to discuss race in comic books at New York City Comic Con \nCreated by Stan Lee for Marvel, the Black Panther was the first mainstream African-American superhero. DC \nBlack Lightning is a DC Superhero who debuted in 1977. He sometimes assists the Justice League of America. VERTIGO \nQuentin Tarantino's movie \"Django Unchained\" was turned into a comic book series shortly after the film's release. MARVEL \nLuke Cage, a Marvel character, is a hero for hire with super hero strength. \nAs an African-American kid growing up in the early ‘80s, Dumas Thompson and his friends would search for comic book heroes they could connect with. \n“There were a couple of characters that they made for the African-American demographic,” Thompson says, citing Black Goliath, Luke Cage and Black Panther as examples. “When you saw them — for the ones they didn’t put in Africa, i.e., Black Panther — they had this sort of inner-city roughness.” \nFor Thompson and his friends, following these characters was about more than just entertainment. \n“At that age, we were searching for our heroes and our identity in these characters,” says Thompson, CEO of audio engineering company SoundLAB Products. \nPanel discussion \nThompson participated in a panel discussion titled “From Black Face to Black Panther: The Evolution of the Depiction of People of Color in Comics, Graphic Novels and Film” that was presented at the Lancaster Barnes & Noble store in February. \nThe panel was initiated by the NAACP’s Lancaster branch in celebration of African Heritage Celebration Month. \nThe panelists have been invited to present on Friday, Oct. 9, at New York City Comic Con , an annual comics, graphic novel and entertainment convention. Last year, more than 150,000 people attended the event. \nShayna Watson, executive committee member of the NAACP’s Lancaster branch, organized and moderated the panel. \nIn addition to Thompson, the conversation will feature Jamie Broadnax, founder of BlackGirlNerds.com ; Joe Miller, owner of the Comic Store; the Rev. Chris Eden, pastor of Boehm’s United Methodist Church; Avery Thompson, manga artist and a graphic arts and design major at Kutztown University; Todd Spidle, an editorial staff artist for LNP; and Eric Dean Seaton, a TV director. \nDiverse backgrounds \nWhile other panels at Comic Con also will discuss race, Watson says the Lancaster-centric panel will focus on the consumer perspective. The panelists have diverse professional and ethnic backgrounds. \n“I think it’s important to have both sides of the spectrum — those who feel underrepresented and those who are in the position of privilege, either inherited unbeknownst to them, or intentionally, if you will,” Watson says. \nWatson will ask panelists to discuss a variety of topics, including when they became aware of race in comics, graphic novels and films. \n“I’ve lived long enough to have seen a lot of changes, and I have the perspective of reading comics entirely through that time period,” says Miller, who bought the Comic Store in 1985. “From the ‘50s until now, I’ve read comics.” \nMiller says he remembers being a child reading “Sergeant Fury and the Howling Commandos,” a World War II comic series produced by Marvel, and thinking that it was cool that one of the commandos was black. He says it wasn’t until he got older that he realized that an integrated unit was unusual for that time period. \n“Little Nemo in Slumberland” is another comic discussed by the panel for how it depicts African-Americans. Impie, an African character, is portrayed as unintelligent, carries a spear and is cannibalistic. \n“The earliest depiction of African-Americans and even some other marginalized cultures and ethnicities, when you see them in print, they’re always of a caricature nature,” Thompson says. “It’s not until you get into the ‘60s and ‘70s when they start to de-caricaturize and start to show African-Americans and marginalized cultures in a more healthier view of civil rights.” \nPositive depictions \nOne of the earlier positive depictions of African-Americans was “Black Goliath,” a comic about a research scientist who develops a formula that gives him super strength. While Thompson says Black Goliath still had that strong roughness so often associated with black characters, integrating that with intelligence was incredibly important. \n“When you start having this reference of higher intellect in the African-American community, you start to show them in this one light that prior to that had not been seen,” Thompson says. \nWhile the conversation deals with aspects of entertainment, Watson emphasizes the importance of discussing race relations in a healthy, safe space. \n“The conversation, while it’s supposed to be light and fun and have some comedic moments — because it’s a comic strip, it’s graphic entertainment — at the same time, there is a critical aspect of it that really highlights the dangers if we’re not responsible in our craft, how we depict the ‘other,’ “ Watson says.
