Century. $45. \nEngland, 1463: two years after the Battle of Towton the south is ruled by the House of York, while the impoverished north is in hands of the Lancastrian King. Following the horrors of the battle, young lovers Thomas and Katherine are eventually reunited. However, they now find themselves pursued by the Church, the law and a psychotic lord from their past, all after a secret they have hidden.\nThis is the second book in the Kingmaker series, which chronicles the adventures of Thomas and Katherine during the War of the Roses. Containing several epic battles, political conspiracies and even descriptions of medieval surgery, Clements has produced a well-paced novel with an evocative historical setting.\nCLASH OF EAGLES\nBy Alan Smale. Titan Books. $14.99. \nAdvertisement What if the Roman Empire had never fallen? In Smale's alternative history Rome is the main power in Europe in 1218 and Praetor Gaius Marcellinus is ordered to conquer the newly discovered continent across the ocean. However, after suffering a destructive defeat Gaius is captured and forced to share his knowledge of Roman technology and strategy with the local tribes.\nSmale combines a great story about being an outsider with a well-researched speculative setting. While some elements of the story, such as the inventive Native American technology, are unlikely, Smale does provide a large amount of detail and defends his decision in the appendices. Fun, insightful and addictive, this is an engaging read.\nTHE TAMING OF THE QUEEN\nBy Philippa Gregory. Simon & Schuster. $32.99. \nKaterynâ€‹ Parr's life is turned upside down when she is forced to accept King Henry VIII's proposal of marriage. Old and sick, Henry has survived five marriages and executed two of his previous wives. Kateryn brings stability to the Royal family, while tempering the King's religious persecutions. After starting a radical study circle and becoming the first woman to publish in England, however, she becomes a target of the country's religious radicals who seek to undermine her.\nThis is the seventh book about the Tudor Court from Gregory, who has now described all of Henry's Queens. An intense story about love, freedom and religion, it is an intriguing look at a controversial historical figure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:33:58.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
