Now when people meet me, they pull out their phones to take pictures. I do not know much about social media, but it seems that that's what makes people more famous. My era of Hollywood was much better - you were known for your skill and talent. I was very lucky to be a part of that time.'' \nSophia also warned younger actresses against having invasive cosmetic surgery because they could ruin their natural beauty. \nThe 'Grumpier Old Men' star added to the New York Post newspaper, she said: ''These young girls really need to be more careful and selective of what they are doing to their bodies and their faces. I mean, you do not know for sure if you are going to a good doctor ... you can end up looking worse than what you thought you originally were.'' \nOther stars in attendance at the Americans for the Arts National Arts Awards included Lady GaGa , Maria Bell and Herbie Hancock .
