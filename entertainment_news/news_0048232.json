The reforms, which will be implemented later this fall, come at a time when tens of thousands of pretrial defendants are detained in jails statewide because they cannot afford to post bail.\nIn New York City, nearly 50,000 defendants are detained each year because they cannot post bail, Lippman said. Ninety percent of those for whom bail is imposed do not make bail at arraignment, and half of those defendants remain in jail for the entire duration of their case, according to the state’s courts system.\n“With the reforms announced today, we will make major strides in overhauling our broken system of bail,” Lippman said in a statement. “Reforming the institution of bail in New York will go a long way toward ensuring that our justice system not only protects the public safety, but also is fair and just for each and every New Yorker — rich and poor alike.”\nLippman has been unable to get the state Legislature to pass law that would allow judges to take into account the defendant’s risk to public safety when setting bail and even release defendants without bail if they pose no risk.\nNew York is one of four states that do not allow the judge to take the risk of public safety into account when setting bail\nLippman, who will be retiring at the end of this year, said he would take independent action to enact some changes during a speech before the Citizens Crime Commission in Manhattan.\nThe reforms include four key measures: automatic judicial review of bail for misdemeanor cases; periodic review of bail for felony cases; a pilot electronic supervision program in Manhattan Criminal Court; and allowing judges accept alternative forms of bail.\n“The need for reform, by any standard, is stronger than ever.” Lippman said in his speech. “We cannot wait to act for one second longer, and, as the steward of the Judiciary, I will not wait to act when it is within my ability to do so.”\nThe effort drew praise from prison-rights advocates, but concerns from some Republican lawmakers over letting out potentially dangerous people from jail.\n“The safety of the public has to be utmost on our minds,” Assemblyman Peter Lawrence, R-Greece, a former U.S. marshal, said.\nSen. Michael Gianaris, D-Queens, said he plans to introduce legislation that would remove bail requirements from some low-level offenses or require supervised release. He said current laws make it difficult for poor people to get out of jail before their cases are adjudicated.\n“The purpose of bail is to not keep criminals off the streets,” he said. “The purpose of bail is to make sure someone who is charged with a crime shows up for the trial.”\nThe state New York Civil Liberties Union said the efforts by Gianaris and Lippman will hopefully create a fairer bail system.\n“What we definitely support is an end to the money bail system, which puts people in jail simply because they are poor,” said Corey Stoughton, a senior staff attorney for the group.\nNMUSCAVAGE@Gannett.com\nwww.twitter.com/nmuscavage\nIncludes reporting by Gannett Albany Bureau chief Joseph Spector.", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/nmuscavage"], "published": "2015-10-02T04:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:13:19.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
