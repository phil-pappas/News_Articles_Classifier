Michael was the youth pastor and Christian Education director at the Chicago Gospel Tabernacle.\nSix months later, the worshippers moved their location to the American Legion Hall in Arlington Heights. They decided to become an official church, chose the name \"Meadows Gospel Church,\" and the Rev. Green signed on as pastor.\nOne charter member of the church, Nora Walker, is still an active member.\nTwo years later, the name was changed to Meadows Baptist Church and the congregation moved back to Kimball Hill School, where the gymnasium hosted all Sunday services and Sunday school.\nAt the same time a suitable location was sought for a permanent church building, and eventually five acres of property at Kirchoff Road and Oriole Lane became available.\nGround was broken on April 24, 1960. During those first five years, church membership had increased significantly and many of the members contributed their time and energy to the process of constructing the church building in order to reduce the costs.\nThe first services were held in the new building Feb. 5, 1961. Since then, two additional buildings were built and eventually a complete renovation took place.\nRev. Green served the church from 1955 through 1978.\nToday, one other congregation shares the facility, the Chicago Northwest Suburban Chinese Christian Church.\nThe Meadows Christian Fellowship church mission statement is: \"Helping people know, love and become like Jesus.\" News Rolling Meadows Religion", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-20T21:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:09:08.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
