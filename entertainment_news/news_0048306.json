We want to hear it. Still, the nostalgia card is well-played, but this isn’t exactly Transformers the way your remember it because PlatinumGames introduces some exciting energy to the combat. I’ve never seen the Autobots fight the way they do in Devastation’s six-hour campaign. The high-octane action is a rad, over-the-top direction, where Cybertronian warriors can unleash blistering combos. You can take any of the five playable Autobots (Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Grimlock, Sideswipe, and Wheeljack) into any mission, and each is a good, distinct mix of power speed with a unique ability and fighting style that sets them apart. So while Bumblebee’s speedy melee strikes don’t do a ton of damage compared to Optimus Prime’s fierce sweeping trailer attack, his ability to link together vehicle attacks quickly makes him just as useful. Grimlock’s Dinobot moves stand out as some of the most ridiculous fun in Devastation. On top of being a an adorable robotic tyrannosaurus who runs like a duck, his primal attacks allows him to finish off an foe by clotheslining him and dragging him face-first through the ground. “ \nThe high-octane action is a rad, over-the-top direction... Of course, watching a car zip into a mid-air backflip might look ridiculous, but these vehicle burst attacks are part of a deep combo system that’s easy to learn yet complex enough to quickly switch between melee attacks, gunplay, and vehicle attack forms. I could string together attacks easily enough, but there’s also complexity in the form of animation cancelling and lengthy combo chains -- which are especially fun to pull off on towering bosses like Devastator. The robust combat system allows me to flex some creative muscle when beating up the Decepticons. Going from car-to-bot and back is part of a great core loop that never got old. What did get old were some driving sections, which try to set up exhilarating chase sequences, but ultimately fail because of poor design. Sometimes I’d overtake the boss I was chasing, only to get lost because I couldn’t quite tell where I was on these repetitive race tracks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:42:46.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
