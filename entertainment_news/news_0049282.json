I'd land at the airport and people would yell out, 'You're fat!' It was awful.\" \nThe 23-year-old singer, who first found fame as a child on 'Barney & Friends,' was very surprised to become a victim of body shaming. \nShe told Us Weekly: \"I've been working since I was seven. This was the first year I ever dealt with anyone talking about my body.\" \nBut the 'Hotel Transylvania 2' star insists she is doing well. \nShe said: \"Even if I did gain weight, I'm fine. That's what the [Instagram] picture represents.\" \nThe brunette beauty, who spent two weeks in rehab in early 2014 for an undisclosed condition, previously praised social media for giving her \"more control\" over her image and stated her responses to her haters are always \"very intentional.\" \nShe added: \"I don't want them [the critics] to win. It's not fair for them to try to control my life. \n\"I want to be heard, and I don't want people to see those comments and think they can bring people down, because it's not right.\" bang showbiz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T05:19:22.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
