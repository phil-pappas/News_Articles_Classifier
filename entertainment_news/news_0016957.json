He's going to be a phenomenal Oscar host!\" \n\"I'm so glad to be hosting the Oscars,\" Rock said. \"It's great to be back.\" \nRock hosted the 77th Oscar awards in 2005 and didn't change his confrontational comedic style for the show, poking fun at celebs like Jude Law. While Rock was praised by some critics for being himself, he was also chastised by those who simply couldn't take the joke(s). \nHe'll join an illustrious group of standup comedians who have hosted of multiple Oscar ceremonies; it includes Whoopi Goldberg, Billy Crystal, Bob Hope, Ellen DeGeneres and Steve Martin. \nThe 88th Academy Awards will be broadcast live February 28 on ABC. \nThe-CNN-Wire", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:20:01.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
