She spoke about the importance of giving, protecting, and the need for an aggressive attitude in freeing the world from the sickness of slavery.\nNorma Bastidas, a 46-year-old single mother of two, and a survivor of both sexual violence and human trafficking, spoke next, recounting experiences from her past and inspiring the audience to end violence and trafficking.\nThe 2015 Update and Hotel Award was presented, then came the highly anticipated live auction that included a Park City Escape, Maui Condo Week Stay, a Women's Tennis Association (WTA) Vip package for four, and a Portugal Resort seven night stay.\nThe evening was also graced by several accomplished musicians. Pianist Kendra Lowe, who has recorded dozens of movie soundtracks and trailers, including Toy Story 3, has played on a number of TV shows, and has recorded the music for several video games including Lord of the Rings, performed. Lindsey Stirling, a classically trained violinist from Gilbert, Ariz., who has over 7 million YouTube subscribers, Billboard chart-topping hits, and has performed for sold-out tours worldwide, also performed. Lexi Walker, whose rendition of “Let It Go” from the hit movie Frozen garnered over 70 million views and landed her a spot in the finale of the Disney Christmas Day Parade, rounded out the evening’s musical line-up.\nO.U.R.’s founder, Timothy Ballard, was the Keynote speaker of the evening. He described his decade-long work as a Special Agent for the Department of Homeland Security, where he was assigned to the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force. Today, he serves as O.U.R.’s Jump Team Commander for rescue operations. He gave an inspiring presentation, underscoring the need to donate to save lives.\nThe event inspired many to donate, as community leaders paid up to $7,500 each for a table centerpiece and bid generously on auction items. Before taking into account foundation donations, the event raised over $250,000--one hundred percent of which went to finance missions to rescue children from slavery. John Sorensen, CEO and President of North American Health Care said, “I was inspired by what I heard and saw. How can anyone sit back and do nothing for these children? It is our duty to make a saving difference in these precious lives.”\nOperation Underground Railroad has been working since 2013 to bring child slavery to an end. They have enlisted highly qualified individuals such as Navy Seals, former CIA, and special ops operatives to plan, coordinate, identify, and execute extraction missions. O.U.R. has one goal--to free children of the world from slavery.\nTo learn more about Operation Underground Railroad, or to get involved, visit ourrescue.org .\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13023988.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13023988.htm"], "published": "2015-10-16T05:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:05:38.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
