In an interview at the London premiere of Black Mass, the 39-year-old actor said that he could wear a suit and fight, but that was not what it took to play the Bond, The Independent reports. Cumberbatch said that he doesn't think that the producers would consider him for the role. Lately, Idris Elba, Damian Lewis, Tom Hiddleston and Tom Hardy are rumoured to play the next James Bond. Present James Bond, Daniel Craig , recently said that he would rather slash his wrists than think about playing Bond again any time soon.
