The awards honour those innovators who come up with products that assist their communities. City Press spoke to some of the young innovators who are making a difference in people’s lives.\nFinalists were selected from 125 entries because their ideas showed that they and could be produced in large quantities and be commercialised.\nThe first place winner will walk away with R1.2 up from R1 million in previous years, while second and third place receive R600 000 and R400 000 respectively.\nSeveral grants of between R100 000 and R150 000 will also be awarded to other innovations finalists.
