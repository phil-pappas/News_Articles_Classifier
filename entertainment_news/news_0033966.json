Toni Collette and Drew Barrymore star as best friends in Miss You Already October 1, 2015 4:07pm Image Toni Collette on shaving head for the fifth time 4:13 \nToni Collette and Drew Barrymore play best friends in Miss You Already, but both had challenges to face during filming October 1st 2015 Email a friend \nWHILE most women wouldn’t dream of shaving their head, Toni Collette has done it five times. \nBut none has meant more to her that her latest bald appearance, playing Milly, a mother-of-two fighting breast cancer in her new film Miss You Already. \nCollette stars alongside Drew Barrymore in the film which the pair say is more about love and friendship than the heartbreak of cancer. \n“This was the fifth,” Collette said of shaving her head. “I find it quite cleansing, but in terms of Miss You Already, it was something Milly went through and it was the least I could do, really I would have done anything for this film. I just love the story so much and I think it’s very special and very realistic and relatable and I just didn’t want to fake any of it.” Drew Barrymore and Toni Collette in October 2014.

I mean it grows like a wig, really I’m very ...” \n“Hairy?” offered her co-star Drew Barrymore, as they both erupted in laughter. \nYou can tell the pair’s off screen chemistry is as strong as it is on screen. \nDrew says this is testament to the pair’s relationship and the strength of the script. \n“You hope especially for something like this to do it justice that you have that electric connection and we got lucky and we did. We just plugged right in and that was it. Toni Collette and Drew Barrymore in Sydney to promote their film Miss You Already.
