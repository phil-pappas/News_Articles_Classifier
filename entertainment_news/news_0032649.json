The industry also involves a large number of stamping/lamination fabricators and a mix of well-known multinational companies for PTs as well as many small/medium industrial units specialized in assembly and testing of distribution transformers (DTs). \nUtilities are demanding compliance to higher efficiency requirements in distribution transformers. Most utilities now use purchasing formulae that factored the effect of transformer efficiency into the purchasing decision. Manufacturers have responded by tailoring their products to the energy evaluation factors specified by customers, so that it is now possible to purchase a high-cost, high-efficiency transformer or a unit with a lower first cost and lesser efficiency.\n\nIn the last two decades, amorphous metal transformers (AMTs) used as distribution transformers have reduced system losses. These novel and highly energy-efficient units were slightly more expensive but had significantly lower operating costs than conventional units, resulting in lower life-cycle (LC) or total ownership costs (TOC). \nAccording to a new iRAP report, the global market reached to about $41,560 million in 2014, and it is estimated to increase to $63,500 million by 2019 at a CAGR of 8.8 % per year from 2014 to 2019. China has the largest market share followed by the US, Europe , India and Japan . \n\nRead the full report: http://www.reportlinker.com/p03187703-summary/view-report.html \nAbout Reportlinker \nReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution that finds, filters and organizes the latest industry data so you get all the market research you need - instantly, in one place. \nhttp://www.reportlinker.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T01:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:54:50.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
