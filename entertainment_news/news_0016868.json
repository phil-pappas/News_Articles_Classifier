See the stars who look fabulous at 40 Happy birthday, Kate Winslet! See the stars who look fabulous at 40 Share \nHappy 40th birthday, Kate! \nThe Steve Jobs star looked 10 years younger as she posed on the red carpet of her latest film The Dressmaker last month. (Evan Agostini/Invision) \nIf you can barely believe she’s hitting the big 4-0, then check out these other stars ageing with style. It turns out 1975 was a vintage year for celebs… Kate Winslet (Peter Jordan/PA / Evan Agostini/AP/PA) \nThe fresh-faced Titanic star looked cherubic in 1999. Now she’s an Oscar-winning mother of three who’s even saved Richard Branson’s mother from a fire. Still couldn’t find space for Jack on that door, though… David Beckham (Neal Simpson/EMPICS Sport / Abraham Caro Marin/AP/P) \nA 23-year-old Goldenballs had no idea what was coming: sarongs, a mohawk and that decision to cornrow his hair right before he met Nelson Mandela. Hopefully 40-year-old Becks got that mid-life crisis out his system young. Angelina Jolie (Jordan Strauss/Invision/PA / Valentin Helen Valentine/PA) \nRemember in 1991 when Angelina was married to Billy Bob Thornton and wore a vial of his blood round her neck? Now Mrs Jolie-Pitt juggles six kids, being a UN ambassador and directing hit films. Lara Croft, eat your heart out. Promoted stories Leonardo DiCaprio (Peter Jordan/PA / Amy Sussman/AP/PA) \nPlayboy actor at the premiere of The Man In The Iron Mask in 1998 vs playboy humanitarian changing the world one documentary at a time in 2015. Mel B (Peter Jordan/PA / Ben Hider/Invision/PA) \nThe Spice Girls disbanded in 2000, but 15 years and two reunions later, Mel B’s still putting her scary side to good use as a judge on The Voice Australia. Charlize Theron (Michael Crabtree/PA / Richard Shotwell/Invision/PA) \nSweet to sultry: Monster actress Charlize doesn’t flash that beaming smile like she did at the 2000 Oscars, but she looks just as beautiful in 2015. Eva Longoria (Eric Jamison/David Crotty/AP) \nAt some point in 2005, Eva discovered the secret to eternal youth. Now she’s rudely just not telling the rest of us. Fergie ( Ian West/PA/Paul A Hebert/Invision/AP) \nThe Black Eyed Peas singer is still rocking the same washboard abs as when she released Where Is The Love? in 2003. And possibly the same hair extensions… Declan Donnelly (Peter Jordan/PA / Ian West/PA) \nThis will make you feel old. It’s 26 years since Dec first hung out at the Byker Grove youth club, 21 years since PJ and Duncan exhorted us to Get Ready to Rhumble, and 17 years since the duo joined Cat Deeley on the sofa for SM:TV Live. \nSadly Ant isn’t 40 until 18 November so he doesn’t make the list, but we promise you, young Ant’s worth a google. Enrique Iglesias (Anthony Harvey/PA / Jeff Daly/Invision/PA) \nSmouldering stare? Hint of chest? Smattering of stubble? Enrique won a million girl’s hearts when Hero was released in 2001 and he can still win them today, although they’ll be fighting for his affections with Anna Kournikova. Drew Barrymore (David Cheskin/PA / Evan Agostini/Invision/PA) Share article \nThere’s the same cheeky smile on Drew’s face at the Scream premiere in 1997 as 2015′s Miss You Already. Only the hairdresser’s changed – and that’s probably for the best.
