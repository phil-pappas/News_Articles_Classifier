At the town's grammar school, he was encouraged by several teachers, including John Fisher; he also mentored future poet Harold Massingham, who attended the school at the same time as Hughes. \nAfter his national service, Hughes studied at Cambridge University. It was at a party in the city in February 1956 that he met American writer Sylvia Plath, who became his first wife just months later. \n\"I went to this little celebration and that's actually where we met,\" said Plath, during an interview with the BBC. \"Then we saw a great deal of each other. Ted came back to Cambridge and suddenly we found ourselves getting married a few months later. \n\"We kept writing poems to each other. Then it just grew out of that, I guess, a feeling that we both were writing so much and having such a fine time doing it, we decided that this should keep on.\" \nTheir happiness was short-lived. They had two children, Frieda and Nicholas, but in 1963, after years of battling depression and several previous suicide attempts, Plath took her own life. She was separated from Hughes at the time due to his affair with their lodger, Assia Wevill, who would also commit suicide - simultaneously killing her young daughter Shura - six years later. \nHughes was vilified by some following these events, but he remained silent on the subject, particularly that of Plath, until the release of his best-selling book Birthday Letters in 1998. By that time he had terminal cancer, and died later the same year. \nHughes spent the last 14 years of his life as poet laureate, and is widely regarded as one of the most gifted poets of the 20th century. \nThe documentary shows that the interconnection between what happened during his life and his creativity were at the heart of his work, while fellow writers offer their opinions on his output. But of most interest will be an interview with Frieda Hughes who, in her first such TV appearance, talks in-depth about her father.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T18:27:36.215+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
