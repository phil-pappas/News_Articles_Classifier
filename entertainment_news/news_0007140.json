His \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" earned $119.2 million in 2004; his last film, 2009's \"Capitalism: A Love Story,\" made $14.4 million.\n\"Where to Invade Next\" will be the first film from a not-yet-named distribution label formed by Alamo Drafthouse founder Tim League and former Radius founders Tom Quinn and Jason Janego. Moore called them a \"cinematic Dream Team.\"\nA limited, Oscar-qualifying theatrical release is planned for December. A wider release is also promised in \"hundreds of theaters across the country ahead of the first presidential primary.\"\n\"Together with Michael Moore and his extraordinary new film we hope to remind Americans they have the inalienable right to laugh, especially in an election year,\" Quinn and Janego said in a statement.\n\"Where to Invade Next\" finds Moore traveling to foreign countries, mainly in Europe, to claim their best civic ideas for America - from healthier school lunches to more vacation time for workers.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
