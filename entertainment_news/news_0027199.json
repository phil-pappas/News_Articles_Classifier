In 2015, the lineup included Kendrick Lamar, Mary J. Blige, Erykah Badu, comedian Kevin Hart, Common, India.Arie and Troy \"Trombone Shorty,\" Andrews among others.\nThat kind of talent draws big crowds, so planning ahead is definitely recommended. We've been covering the festival throughout its 22-year history, so we've got all the info you need to know to go.\nHere are the details, which will be updated as more information comes available:\nWhat: The music and culture festival combines free daytime empowerment sessions and panels with star-powered, ticketed night music concerts. Essence often hosts other social events connected to the festival, too, and attendees use the annual get-together as an opportunity to host their own parties.\nWhere: The fest has two New Orleans homes. Empowerment seminars, speakers and the marketplace are at the Ernst N. Morial Convention Center, 900 Convention Center Blvd. When the sun sets, everyone turns to the Mercedez-Benz Superdome for the night's concerts.\nAlso there: This year, the festival will expand its reach with a new edition taking place in South Africa. The South African edition \"will follow the format\" that New Orleanians are used to experiencing, according to a release, with \"international performers and speakers ... as well as a host of local artists and experts.\" No date has been announced.\nWhen: The 2016 Essence Festival starts on Thursday, June 30, and ends late on Sunday, July 3. Daytime activities at the Convention Center typically begin around 9 a.m. on festival days. For the night concerts at the Superdome, doors typically open at 6 p.m., but the big acts and big crowds come later -- sometimes much later .\nAdmission: Daytime events at the Convention Center are free, but the nighttime concerts are ticketed. Single-night tickets usually go on sale in the weeks leading up to the festival. Weekend packages will be available earlier and are sold through Ticketmaster. No 2016 ticket prices have yet been announced.\nSecurity: Large bags will be searched upon entry to all venues.\nParking: Parking is available at the Convention Center and Superdome and at surface lots and ramps in the area. Prices vary during popular events.\nHotels and Travel: Essence Festival partners with local hotels for the weekend, but details aren't available yet. The New Orleans Convention and Visitors Bureau also has a useful hotel directory.\nGetting Around: Essence Fest venues are within walking distance (if you're wearing comfortable shoes ) for guests who stay in the French Quarter and Central Business District. Cabs, Uber and pedicabs are also widely available. For those in outlying areas, public transit is available. The Regional Transit Authority operates streetcars and buses. (The regular fare is $1.25 per person, 40 cents for seniors with ID. Also, one-day Jazzy Passes are $3; three-day passes are $9.)

The event becomes a veritable catwalk for trendy clothing and statement-making shoes.\n Essence Fest 2015 fashion gets tough and relaxed on opening night The 2015 Essence Music Festival kicked off its main stage events at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome on Thursday (July 2) with Trey Songz, Lecrae and Kevin Hart. Essence Fest fans chose their outfits carefully and went for more relaxed looks as they headed to the Dome. Weather : Blazing sun, afternoon thunderstorms and high humidity are likely during Essence Fest, as they are during much of the middle of summer in New Orleans. You'll want to stay looking good, so bring along an umbrella, hat and anything else to help you stay cool and dry. Average daytime high temperatures hover in the low 90s, and things don't cool off much overnight. Oh, by the way: We cope with all of that by blasting the air conditioning, so those prone to goose bumps should plan for that, too.\nYour views: Share your Essence Fest tips with fellow readers in our comment stream.
