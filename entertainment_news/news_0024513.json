Nearly all of the channel's TV movies and series take place in pleasant and picturesque villages, the kinds of towns that make Stars Hollow from \"The Gilmore Girls\" seem edgy, places where you can afford a rambling Victorian home by working only a few hours a week at a bookstore or a notions shop. In short, Hallmark represents happy fantasies and distractions from grim reality. Into this greeting card world enters \"Jesse Stone.\" Granted, the detective series created by novelist Robert B. Parker doesn't have the gruesome body count of edgier noir thrillers like HBO's \"True Detective.\" But the \"Jesse Stone\" movie franchise — now in its 10th year, starring Tom Selleck — takes place in a decidedly downbeat universe, a place where men drink too much in old bars on the wrong side of town. After a long run on CBS, \"Jesse Stone: Lost in Paradise\" (9 p.m.) is the first of the movies to debut on the Hallmark Channel. In typical \"Jesse Stone\" fashion, he's first seen sharing staccato chitchat with his therapist (William Devane); then seen drinking alone either at home or in a bar; then engaging in nearly incomprehensible cryptic banter with a torch singer (Gloria Reuben); and then communing with his dog. Or, rather, talking to himself over the grave of his dead dog. And that's all before the credits sequence concludes. There's a fine line between homage and parody, and \"Jesse Stone\" frequently crosses it with jaw-dropping dialogue — and monologues. But that won't matter much to fans of the series. Look for Luke Perry ( \"Beverly Hills, 90210\" ) as a serial killer known as \"The Boston Ripper.\" He's admitted to the murders of three prostitutes. When a fourth shows up, everybody assumes he's just being shy about his resume. But Jesse has a bloodhound's way of sniffing out inconsistencies. And after several bottles of scotch and laconic conversations with any number of former colleagues, enemies, lovers and possible damsels in distress, he discovers the real culprit. — Oprah Winfrey convenes a seven-night exploration of faiths both orthodox and emerging on \"Belief\" (8 p.m., OWN), airing nightly through next Saturday.
