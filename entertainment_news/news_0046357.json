Needless to say, the mountainous background makes for a soothing view. First international match- In 2013 the stadium hosted its first international match. The one-day International (ODI) was played between India and the visiting England side, which the host lost. The ground has hosted just two ODIs thus far. The second game was played in 2014 between India and West Indies and hosts emerged as winners this time. First T20- The match between India and South Africa will be the first T20I played at the venue. The stadium has hosted few Indian Premier League (IPL) matches as well. First to use rye grass- According to espncricinfo, the stadium is the first in India to use winter rye grass. This type of grass helps the field to stay greener even when temperatures fall below 10 degrees Celsius, which usually happens in Autumn and winter season.
