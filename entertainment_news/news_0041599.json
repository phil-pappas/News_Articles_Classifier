The state Department of Health announced the list Friday morning, which includes 15 of the 16 companies that offered individual plans through the exchange this year. But the insurers will have to pick up customers left behind by Health Republic Insurance of New York, a co-op that was ordered to wind down its operations by federal regulators as it neared financial insolvency.\n\"More than 2.5 million New Yorkers have already enrolled in affordable coverage through the NY State of Health Marketplace since its start two years ago,\" NY State of Health Executive Director Donna Frescatore said in a statement. \"We're urging individuals who have not already enrolled in coverage to visit the Marketplace to see what it has to offer in 2016\".\nHealth Republic was the second most popular choice among private insurers last year on the state's marketplace, picking up 19 percent -- or roughly 83,000 -- of the individuals who enrolled for a non-Medicaid plan.\nLate last month, federal and state agencies began the process of shutting the co-op down, leaving its customers to find a new plan through the exchange for 2016.\nThe top insurer through the exchange, Fidelis Care, will return in 2016. This year, Fidelis accounted for 20 percent of individual enrollments in private plans through NY State of Health.\nAmong the other returning insurers are MVP Health Plan, EmblemHealth and North Shore LIJ.\nNot all of the insurers offer plans in every county, however. Monroe County individuals, for example, can opt for private plans from Excellus, Fidelis Care and MVP. In Westchester County, individuals have eight companies to pick from, including Affinity Health Plan and Fidelis Care.\nThe state health department also announced the insurers offering the \"essential\" plan, which carries no deductible and is available to low-income residents, as well as dental plans and small-business plans.\nEleven companies are offering dental plans in 2016, including Delta Dental and Emblem.\nFor a county-by-county list, visit http://info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/PlansMap .\n2016 Individual Marketplace Plans by County <p>&gt;</p>", "external_links": ["http://info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/PlansMap", "https://www.scribd.com/embeds/285402239/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&show_recommendations=true", "https://www.scribd.com/doc/285402239/2016-Individual-Marketplace-Plans-by-County"], "published": "2015-10-16T20:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T21:56:29.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
