Parenting: \"I wanted my side of the story out there. I never had a voice. It was always shaped by the TV show or by Playboy or Hef himself. But I want my daughter to know why I made the decisions I did. \n\"Since writing the book, I've had a lot of practice defending myself and the choices I made and I think that has been good practice for discussing those decisions with her.\" celebrity", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:42:51.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
