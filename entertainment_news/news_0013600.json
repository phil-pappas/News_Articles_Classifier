Comment   TV Guide Posted Oct. 23, 2015 at 11:08 AM Updated at 2:24 PM Posted Oct. 23, 2015 at 11:08 AM Updated at 2:24 PM Prepare to feel the love on Sunday's CSI: Cyber . As you can see in the sneak peak above, Avery ( Patricia Arquette ) quickly deduces that her two blackhat hackers Nelson ( Shad Moss ) and Raven ( Hayley Kiyoko ) may be spending more time together than usual outside of work. \"Those two are leaving in separate elevators,\" she tells D.B. Russell ( Ted Danson ). \"They never used to do that. They are dating!\" Why CSI: Cyber will scare the crap out of you Although D.B. voices concerns that a pair of blackhats dating violates the deal they made with the FBI when they joined Avery's team, Avery is a little more forgiving. \"They only have each other,\" she says. \"Everyone deserves to get laid.\" That said, Avery isn't sure the fling will last. \"Nelven is a very improbable match,\" she says, bestowing the couple with a proper 'shipper name. And just wait until you see how confused D.B. is by the idea of portmanteaus. Check out the clip above and watch CSI: Cyber Sunday at 10/9c on CBS. (Full disclosure: TVGuide.com is owned by CBS.)
