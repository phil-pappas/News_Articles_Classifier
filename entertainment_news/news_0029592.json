The film is available to all customers for free on Amazon Video today and can also be watched on the HumanKinda Tumblr site as well as YouTube . \nHumanKinda is the feeling of being so busy that you are losing your humanity. As JetBlue continues to look for new ways to inspire humanity, the film, presented through the independent lens of Giaever, delivers a uniquely entertaining way to encourage people to question their busyness. \n\"Everyone knows someone who uses busyness as a badge of honor, but we see it as a cultural shift that is affecting us all,\" said Jamie Perry, vice president of brand and product development at JetBlue. \"We are presenting this film to stimulate more conversation about busyness, and further our mission of inspiring humanity. We hope to inspire viewers to pause and reflect on where they're putting time and energy, and take steps toward living their life to the fullest.\" \nDirector Bianca Giaever brings her whimsical, smart and humorous point of view on a journey following two busy subjects, a single mom from New Jersey and a young man from Washington, D.C. with eight different jobs, as they seek advice from relaxation experts, visit with retired women in their golden years, and hear from a man who has rebelled against the system, living without a smart phone for more than a year. \nThe film was made in conjunction with award-winning production and entertainment company m ss ng p eces, which is recognized for pioneering branded content and original series that celebrate the human spirit, innovation, art and culture. \nJetBlue is educating and inspiring additional conversations on the topic of busyness with a social ecosystem of shareable content housed on Tumblr and extending to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest channels. Over 100 pieces of original content were created to stimulate discussions with the hope of permeating the cultural zeitgeist while encouraging people to take pause and reflect on their own busyness levels. \nWith a continued commitment to entertainment innovations, JetBlue is presenting the film on Amazon Video and will expand to its seatback TVs later this year. JetBlue and Amazon announced earlier this year that it would bring instant streaming video onboard to create an unmatched entertainment experience in the sky. \nAbout JetBlue JetBlue is New York's Hometown Airline™, and a leading carrier in Boston, Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood, Los Angeles (Long Beach), Orlando, and San Juan.
