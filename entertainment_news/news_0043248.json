The British journalist and documentary filmmaker has been doing incredible work for the best part of two decades in his own, unique voice.\nHis latest, which will also be his first to get a theatrical run, has caused possibly the biggest stir of the bunch - not easy when you've made stuff involving Max Clifford, The Westbro Baptist Church and Jimmy Savile.\nMy Scientology Movie features Theroux attempting to shed some insight into the much criticised organisation. It features reconstructions, a first for Theroux, as well as many former Scientologists. The stir came when Theroux found out that the church was simultaneously making a doc about him. He was followed and filmed throughout production and later found out the people filming him were part of the church.\nThe Hollywood Reporter caught up with him, and his Quote: regarding that doc is a little unsettling.\n\"I’m not being glib about this, but I think they’re still working on it. They’re probably running it by their legal department to make sure it’s not defamatory about me. But I fully expect it to be released. But onto the internet let’s say, perhaps not into cinemas. But I wouldn’t be the first person they’ve done this to. I think there’s a little film they did about Gibney. They may be doing another one. They did a video about Marty Rathbun, who features in our film. Calling them documentaries is perhaps a little overgenerous. I guess that’s subjective in it’s own way; they are kind of moving images with sounds and voiceover. But they’re very short, about 10-15 minutes. For the Marty Rathbone one they were alleging that he was abusive and psychotic and interviewed people anonymously who would say that they’d been beaten up by Marty and stuff like that. I can’t imagine what they’re going to do on me. Whether they’d actually interview people who I’ve worked with and find things like, \"he farted and then left the room.\" I hope it is that.\"\nTheroux reckons they're looking for skeletons in his closet, and everyone has them. But he went in with his eyes open knowing this may happen.\nMy Scientology Movie screened at The London Film Festival last week to excellent reviews. There's no release date yet for Ireland, but we can't wait to see it.\nMORE: Louis Theroux's Scientology movie was partly inspired by Joshua Oppenheimer's The Act of Killing\nMORE: The Church of Scientology could be getting a powerful friend in the US Senate\nMORE: Watch: This promo for UFC 193 stars Ronda Rousey's little sister and is amazing", "external_links": ["http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/british-scientology-doc-maker-discusses-832891"], "published": "2015-10-26T19:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:40:08.489+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
