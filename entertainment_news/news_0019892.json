The piece took more than 1,000 hours to create. Photo via artprize.org \nArtPrize Seven has come to an end, and the winners of $500,000 in prize money have been announced. \nThe seventh-annual arts competition saw 1,550 artists participate this year throughout 162 venues. \nArtPrize was held Sept. 23 through Oct. 11 in downtown Grand Rapids. \nVisitors cast a total of 422,763 votes across two rounds of the public vote during this year’s competition, surpassing 2014 totals by more than 24,000 votes. \nThe public selected a grand prize winner and four category winners. \nSeven arts professionals from across the country also served as jurors for the juried awards. The jurors selected one grand prize winner, along with five category winners. \nArtPrize announced the winners on Friday at its awards night. \nPublic vote grand prize winner \n“Northwood Awakening”— a large photographic print and quilt hybrid, depicting a serene woodland panorama, that seamlessly blends the combined textile and photo skills of Loveless PhotoFiber of Frankfort — received the $200,000 ArtPrize Seven Public Vote Grand Prize. \nAnn Loveless, who won the 2013 ArtPrize Public Vote Grand Prize for “Sleeping Bear Dune Lakeshore,” returned to ArtPrize Seven alongside her husband, Steven Loveless, for the collaborative piece. \n“ Northwood Awakening ” was housed in the Gerald R. Ford Museum during ArtPrize. \n“Once again, reverence for technical skill in two-dimensional work — this time in a stunning combination of large-scale photography and intricate textile — has captured the imagination of the voting public,” said Christian Gaines, executive director, ArtPrize. \nJuried grand prize winner \n“Higher Ground “by Kate Gilmore was selected for the $200,000 ArtPrize Seven Juried Award Grand Prize. \nGilmore's work explores the dynamics of power and the construct of femininity. The performance piece included as many as nine women in long white dresses and red shoes, who swung on swings mounted from the ceiling in front of open windows throughout ArtPrize. \n\" Higher Ground \" was set in a once private home that was later used as a convent. \nThe performance piece was part of the SiTE:LAB/The Rumsey Street Project. \n“Kate Gilmore’s piece is really kind of magical in a way that we’ve maybe lost sight of,” said Dan Cameron, juror, ArtPrize . “It really can contribute to a shared mythology that we can all unpack. And even though the object isn’t there, we can continue to tell each other the stories about it.” \nPublic vote category winners ($12,500 each) \nTwo-dimensional \n“ Northwood Awakening ,” by Loveless PhotoFiber (also won the public vote grand prize and received a total of $200,000) \nThree-dimensional \n“ Greatest Generation/Beta Team/November ,” by Fred Cogelow \nInstallation \n“ REACH and SPLASH ,” by Andy Sacksteder \nTime-based", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:42:30.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
