Gliding steps propelled him across the stage he silently dominated. \nMoving and leaping with leonine strength and ease, he extended that feline character to the way he played with his human prey. When the moment arrived for him to take the blood of one such prey, Lucy, he did so with a seductive kiss to the neck as opposed to a violent bite. \nAnd that face. That impassive, imperturbable, unreadable and completely mesmerizing face, a character mask he maintained even through curtain calls, making one want to duck behind another patron whenever his gaze turned to the audience. \nPatrick Howell created an everyman character with Harker, through which the audience enters Dracula's world. He danced with power and passion, including a, breathtakingly dangerous pas de deux with the vampire. \nLuz San Miguel danced a heartbreaking transformation from light-footed, girlish innocence to dark, heartless mania. Susan Gartell created a true-of-heart, gracefully serene Mina. \nDenis Malinkine was a sympathetic Van Helsing, with Marc Petrocci dancing a brief pas de deux while wearing a straitjacket in the crazed role of Renfield. \nAlexandre Ferreira created a strong-willed Quincy, matched well by Timothy O'Donnell's Arthur. \nA large supporting cast gave superbly danced, character-filled performances in individual and corps roles. \nMusic director Andrews Sill and the Milwaukee Ballet Orchestra gave a spirited, cohesive rendering of Feeney's captivatingly cinematic score, despite occasional awkward amplification. IF YOU GO \n\"Dracula\" continues through Sunday at the Marcus Center's Uihlein Hall, 929 N. Water St. Visit www.milwaukeeballet.org/ or call (414) 273-7206. © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc.
