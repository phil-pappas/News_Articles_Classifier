Pokie Nation four years ago after it was brought to her by fellow producer Neil Lawrence, who died suddenly in July this year, just days after it was finished.\nShe says the filmmaking process amounted to be a “shocking realisation” of the insidiousness of modern-day pokie machines and the predatory industry that’s pulling the lever.\nOther Stories Awesome All Blacks lay Cardiff ghosts to rest Rugby 0 comments Will Geoffrey ever find love again?

Back in 2000, the company’s billionaire founder Len Ainsworth was asked by Four Corners what the secret to their success was, and he didn’t mince his words.\n“Building a better mouse trap,” he said.\nIt may not have been deliberate, but the metaphor of a mouse caught in a trap has proved to be a scarily accurate one.\nAs the science and technology involved in the industry has advanced in recent years, manufacturers have been able to design machines perfectly engineered to create addiction.\n“They’re actually designed to take advantage of how the brain works,” Ms Goldman says. “They have the same effect on the brain as cocaine does.”\nPublic health expert Dr Charles Livingstone went a step further.\n“It’s like having someone on every street corner selling drugs with a licence from the government,” he told news.com.au.\nThe machines are designed to keep their players in a trance by taking advantage of certain chemical responses in the brain. Features such as the random reinforcement schedule that disguises losses as wins and the in-built programming that gives the frequent appearance of a near miss all work to prey on the neurological makeup of players.\nEverything from the painstakingly composed music to the speed of the spinning reels is engineered to hypnotise players. Players like Sharon Hollamby.\nThat haze stays with you when you leave the venue,” she told news.com.au. “You still here the music in your head.”\nMs Hollamby battled pokie addiction for 15 years. She now works with an advocacy group she founded in 2010 called Communities Without Pokies.\nPLAYING TO EXTINCTION\nA study carried out in the 1950s by American scientists James Olds and Peter Milner gave unprecedented understanding of the power of stimulating certain areas in the brain. The most famous of these experiments involved a rat that was given the chance to self administer a pleasurable electric shock to the brain by simply pressing a pedal. The rat ignored food and drink and kept pressing the pedal until it died of exhaustion.\nResearchers say the same underlying mechanisms are at play when someone blows all their money on the pokies.\nMachines are set to pay out anywhere from 85 to 97 cents of every dollar they take in. According to one designer featured in the documentary, many Aussie machines he deals with are programmed at the lower end of the scale, meaning they chew money quicker. But even though they’re programmed to return a percentage of the money, if a player continues to play indefinitely, they will eventually lose everything.\nIt’s known as “playing to extinction” by industry insiders and it’s considered the common goal of pokie manufacturers.\nJust like the rat that keeps on pressing the pedal.\nPublic health researchers are forced to always be playing catch-up with the industry. THE RUTHLESS TRANSFER OF WEALTH\nThroughout Australia, pokies bring in $12 billion of revenue a year. Western Australia is the only state in the country that doesn’t allow them.\nWhile that figure comes straight from the back pockets of ordinary Australians and can prove devastating on a personal level, the macro consequences are equally as ruinous.\nClubs and pubs with large numbers of machines are disproportionately found in poorer postcodes around the country. “Sometimes there is not much else to do (in these communities),” Ms Goldman says. As a consequence, that $12 billion is overwhelmingly coming from problem gamblers in lower socio-economic areas. “It’s quite predatory on those people that can least afford to play these machines,” she says.\n“What poker machines do is entrench disadvantage,” Dr Livingstone says. “It provides a channel of money from disadvantaged people to the wealthy, including the shareholders of Woolworths. “It’s a good way to ensure intergenerational disadvantage.”\nWoolworths and Coles together are the largest owners of poker machines in Australia, with more than 15,000 machines.\nThe gaming industry and the Australia Hotels Association are quick to point out the benefits of pokies by putting money back into the community. While state governments certainly rely on revenue generated by pokie machines for roads and hospitals, Dr Livingstone is sceptical about the real economic benefit they provide.\n“At the moment, cost-benefit appears to favour industry, but when you look closely, those benefits appear pretty hollow,” he said.\nDr Livingstone said there was a grave social cost caused by problem gamblers that is difficult to quantify. “The consequences are divorce, crime, physical and mental harm, and in many cases suicide,” he said.\nMs Hollamby works with a number of counselling groups in her home state of South Australia and echoes his concerns.\n“A lot more people are addicted than what is being reported,” she says. “People are killing themselves over these stupid machines.”\nAnti-poker machine rally at Parliament House in Adelaide in July 1992. IN LOVE WITH THE MONEY\nThose seeking reform in the industry face a daunting challenge. State governments have become reliant on the easy revenue created by the machines and lobbyists for the gambling industry maintain close ties with government officials.\nWhile it’s long been a political issue, genuine actions are hard to achieve.\nIndependent South Australian political candidate Mark Aldridge works alongside Ms Hollamby and says the impediments to reform are many.\nA former pokie addict himself, he realised the machines had a hold on him when he faked being robbed after losing $2000 in one particular trip to the pub.\nWhile fellow South Australian independent politician Nick Xenephon shot to the senate on an anti-pokies platform and is a well-known opponent of the industry, Mr Aldridge has been bitterly disappointed by the lack of action from the senator.\n“I think they’re token efforts,” he tells news.com.au. “It actually undermines the cause because people think someone’s doing something about it and relax on the topic. But these things need to be worked on daily.”\nIn 2010, federal reform looked close to happening, but it was eventually squashed by the highly organised gaming industry.\nNot afraid to go on the offensive, ClubsNSW has already launched defamation action against the ABC for comments made in the documentary by former Labor minister Peter Garrett that implied he had previously been bribed by the group.\nDr Livingstone says the pokie fight is similar to the early days of the tobacco industry and the push for greater road safety. Just like the introduction of seatbelts and airbags reduced the death toll on our roads, he wants to see measures that limit the size and frequency of bets allowed on pokie machines.\nAs for the film, producer Mitzi Goldman says it’s all about putting the scrutiny back on the machine in the face of what she calls a successful PR campaign to place the responsibility solely on the players: the problem gamblers.\nKa-Ching!
