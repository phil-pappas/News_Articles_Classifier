And I said, 'Will you reach in there and grab something for me?'\" \nThe couple - who are known for being notoriously tight-lipped on their private life - haven't shared their happy news until now because they want to keep their romance \"sacred\". \nHe explained: \"Truth be told, it's not something we wanted to promote. We're a collective power together because our private life is sacred. \n\"But you know what though, maybe it's time. Maybe it is time for the world to know that I have a very secure situation and a loving woman supporting me the entire way.\" \nAlthough the loved-up duo haven't started planning their nuptials as of yet, the Forget You hitmaker is keen to be \"spontaneous\" when it comes to getting hitched in the future. \nHe added with a smile: \"I'm a pretty hands on person. We'll be prepared to be spontaneous.\" \nMeanwhile, this isn't the first time CeeLo - whose real name is Thomas DeCarlo Callaway - has popped the question as he was previously married to Christina Johnson for five years until they divorced in 2005.
