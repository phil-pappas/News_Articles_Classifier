Eliot Prize in 1994. He teaches at Princeton University, according to a news release from St. Ben's and St. John's University. \nThe Ireland native is The New Yorker's poetry editor. His latest collection of poems, \"One Thousand Things Worth Knowing,\" has received praise as a \"dazzlingly complex\" book. \nIn a review for The Telegraph, Charlotte Runcie said Muldoon's poetry \"combines snippets of the ancients (terracotta warriors, Benedictine nuns, the life of Moses) with up-to-the-minute vernacular and freshness (mash-ups and selfies).\" \n\"His technical and linguistic brilliance is probably second to none,\" Fran Brearton said in a review for The Guardian. \nThe Literary Arts Institute is presenting the Thursday event, which is free and open to the public. It will be in Room 204 of the Gorecki Center, which stands near the middle of the St. Ben's campus to the east of guest parking lot No. 5.
