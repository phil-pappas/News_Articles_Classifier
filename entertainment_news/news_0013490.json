Why would you do this? Beauty, of course. MTG, the company behind the product, says that it will slim your face, because that makes perfect sense.\nCurrently retailing for about S$200 (â‚¬125), it's doing so well that it can afford to bring in a foreign celebrity to endorse it, so obviously Cristiano Ronaldo is the first choice.\nRight, we're not sure why this is a thing, or how it's come to pass, but all we can say is that for his own good when it comes to internet GIFs, we're glad he doesn't actually use the product in this ad.\nTurns out this shouldn't come as too much of a surprise, because Ronaldo has endorsed another product for MTG, this face roller.\nAs if we could let a ridiculous Japanese TV ad pass-by without dragging up this up.\nVia Mashable\nMORE: Watch: Incredible training ground tekkers from Cristiano Ronaldo\nMORE: The cost for a Superbowl commercial has hit a record high\nMORE: Watch: Want to see a dad pull off some wrestling moves on his kid?
