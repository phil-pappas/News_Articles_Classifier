Who lands right there on Las Vegas Boulevard in a plane, comes to a stop at the traffic light, then takes off again when it turns green? \nInsane pilot skills race hero Kirby Chambliss, a renowned world champion in aerobatics from Arizona, did just that to promote this weekend’s Red Bull World Championships Races at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, and we have the YouTube video to prove it! \nOur LVMS track is the last of the eight global stops of the Red Bull Championships to decide this year’s champion. Last year, more than 50,000 fans turned out at our track, which hosted the air races for the first time. \nFans from around the world will head out to the track Saturday, and expect a showdown between Great Britain’s Paul Bonhomme and Australia’s Matt Hall in the finale. \nThe best race pilots on the planet are put to the ultimate test in one of the world’s fastest motorsports series in competition that mixes skill, precision and speed. The pilots fly the fastest, most agile and lightweight racing planes to navigate a low-level aerial track made up of 80-foot-high air-filled pylons at speeds up to 230 mph while enduring 10G forces — just hundreds of feet away from fans. \nQualifying day is set for Saturday, and race day is Sunday. Race director Steve Jones says density altitude in Las Vegas will be the pilots’ greatest adversary. \n“The air is less dense at nearly 2,000 feet above sea level, and temperatures are expected at 82 degrees. This robs the race engines of power and makes the wings less able to turn. Smooth flying and pinpoint accuracy are a must for the pilots battling with power and performance.” \nHe reminded that the track has a new layout to give the 14 race pilots an extra challenge as they maneuver through eight gates. Here’s his YouTube video of last year’s track explanation. \nPaul starts the race with 67 points from his races this year, and Matt is in striking range with 59. The two men have dominated the season, the ninth to date, racing in Hungary, England, United Arab Emirates, Japan, Eastern and Western Europe and Fort Worth, Texas, on Sept. 27, in all seven countries on three continents. Travis Cloer \nKICKSTARTER CD: “Jersey Boys” at Paris Las Vegas star Travis Cloer is in the final stretch of his Kickstarter crowd-funded Christmas CD. Next Tuesday, presales begin on iTunes, Amazon and Google Play. \nThe official release is Nov. 3, with a celebration party Nov. 9 in the Foundation Room atop Mandalay Bay to benefit HELP of Southern Nevada. Travis will star in his third-annual holiday show at Cabaret Jazz in the Smith Center on Dec. 7 performing the entire album live twice with musical arranger Keith Thompson ’s seven-piece band. \nI’m proud to be one of the Kickstarter contributors. Here’s a YouTube video of last year’s concert. \nFOLLOW-UP: I recently wrote in a Wicked Whispers & Racy Rumors item that a Las Vegas reality-TV star had been “catfished” online. Now the story is out that “Sister Wives” star Meri Brown was the victim of a female Internet stalker by the name of Jackie Overton who pretended to be businessman Sam Cooper from Las Vegas and Chicago. \nIn Touch Weekly has exposed the catfisher in a bizarre story of its confrontation with her in Oklahoma pretending to be a cheerleader with the Oklahoma City Thunder. Within hours of the confrontation, all her fake phone numbers and websites were disconnected and taken offline. \nFor more on the “Sister Wives” scandal, check out the new issue of In Touch Weekly. \nMUSIC GIFT: The band program at Andre Agassi’s College Preparatory Academy received a boost with a $4,500 grant from House of Blues Music Forward Foundation in the form of instruments and other music resources. In 12 months, Music Forward has awarded $225,000 for 62 schools serving underserved youth nationwide.
