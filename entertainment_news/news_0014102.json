STAGE: THE REAL THING\nTom Stoppard's teasingly brilliant play about love and fidelity is the story of Charlotte, an actress in a play about marriage written by her husband, Henry. Max, her leading man, is also married to an actress, Annie. Then Henry and Annie fall in love. But is it the real thing? Alice Livingstone directs. Ainslie McGlynn and Chris Tomkinson​ feature.

STAGE: GHOSTS\nAdvertisement It's opening night for Depot Theatre's production of Henrik Ibsen's Ghosts , the story of an unhappy widow and her prodigal son, an artist who has inherited syphilis through the debauchery of his supposedly upstanding father. One critic described Ghosts as \"a loathsome sore unbandaged\" when the play debuted in London in 1891. Reason enough to see it, we think.

ART: GREY MATTER\nIf Fifty Shades of Grey proved that grey was not the lifeless colour it once seemed, Artbank's new exhibition, Grey Matter, aims to do the same. Drawn from the Artbank collection by curator Mark Feary, the display focuses on works with a restrained palette and a broad sense of black and white pairings, opposites and extremes. Opening with the decisive simplicity of Paddy Guwumji Bedford's Camel Back , the show traverses mediums from painting and sculpture to the wonderful hijacking of Bob Dylan's iconic Subterranean Homesick Blues music clip by Soda_Jerk in their video The Popular Front .
