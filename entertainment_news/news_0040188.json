The only problem is that two of them will take place on Sunday, and it may be a bit of a scramble to get to the second after the first has concluded. Listeners may find that, as in real estate, location will be the deciding factor. The specifics for this week are as follows:\nby Dominik, from Flickr (licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic license) Wednesday, October 7, 7:30 p.m.: The second show of the 2015–2016 season for the monthly series Meridian Music: Composers in Performance will feature a visit from Duluth (Minnesota) by instrument inventor Tim Kaiser. Actually, Kaiser has been in the Bay Area since this past weekend, since he contributed to the eighteenth annual Music for People and Thingamajigs Festival this past Saturday (October 3). For this second appearance he will be joined by Berkeley-based Thomas Carnacki, the “purloined moniker” (in Carnacki’s words) for Gregory Scharpen. The concerts in this series are organized by the Meridian Gallery ; but they take place at the Canessa Gallery, which is located at 708 Montgomery Street in the Financial District. Admission is $15 with a $10 rate for students and seniors, payable at the door.\nThursday, October 8, 8 p.m.: Outsound Presents continues to give its weekly concerts in the Luggage Store Creative Music Series at the 509 Cultural Center. This week’s program will again feature three sets, the first of which will begin at 8:10 p.m. That opener will be a solo performance by Singaporean Adam Adhiyatma, who plays both guitar and clarinet. He will be followed by the electro-acoustic improvisation trio Bad Jazz . The regular members are Tania Chen and Bryan Day, while the third slot is a variable one. Instruments include piano, percussion, electronic toys, and invented instruments. The final set will also be taken by a trio. Chinese Fire Drill consists of Brian Pederson doubling on clarinet and saxophone and Dave Dupuis and Sung Kim, both of whom play Nuns Horn. The 509 Cultural Center is located at 509 Ellis Street. As usual, admission will be on a sliding scale between $6 and $15.\nSaturday, October 10, 6 p.m.: This will be the evening when the Yerba Buena Community Benefit District presents the fifth annual Yerba Buena Night. This is a free outdoor arts festival that takes place on the grounds of the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts (YBCA), as well as Yerba Buena Lane and Jessie Square. 30 different types of performance will take place over the course of four hours. Specific details will be available that day beginning at 4 p.m. at an Information Booth where Yerba Buena Lane meets Mission Street. However, it has already been announced that the Sarah Wilson Quintet will be performing at 7 p.m. (although the specific venue has not yet been named). Guest artists Kasey Knudsen, Lisa Mezzacappa, John Hanes, and John Schott will play with the group.\nSunday, October 11, 4 p.m.: Rent Romus will return to Bird & Beckett Books and Records with his Life’s Blood Ensemble to present music from the group’s forthcoming recording entitled Haven . Amber McZeal will offer both poetry and song in her performances with the group. The other instrumentalists will be Heikki Koskinen on e-trumpet and flutes and a rhythm section of Saf Shokrai on bass and Timothy Orr on drums.\nAs its name implies, Bird & Beckett is a shop that sells books and records, located at 653 Chenery Street, a short walk from the Glen Park BART and Muni stations. It is one of the few brick-and-mortar establishments left in this city with an impressive selection of both, appealing to customers who take both reading and listening seriously. There is no charge for the jazz gigs hosted there. However, browsing and purchasing are always encouraged by the shop, and donations for the performers are always welcome.\nSunday, October 11, 7:30 p.m.: The gig on this day will feature Schott on guitar and Hanes on drums moving from Yerba Buena to perform with Dan Seamans on bass as a group called the Actual Trio. This will be the next concert in the Jazz in the Neighborhood series, presented in association with Jazz@YBCA . The venue will be the Red Poppy Art House. Doors will open at 7 p.m. Tickets will be $25 at the door, $20 if purchased in advance, and $5 for students. Unfortunately, the hyperlink for advance purchase on the Red Poppy event page is not, as of this writing, functioning properly. The space is a small one, so even those with tickets are advised to show up when the doors open.", "external_links": ["http://redpoppyarthouse.org/event/john-schott-actual-trio/", "http://meridiangallery.org/"], "published": "2015-10-06T00:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:48:20.571+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
