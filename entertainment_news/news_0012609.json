You just want to move on and make a bigger and better version of the movie. \n“We’ve spent a huge amount of time on this movie just trying to find the humour in it, but also that the story is as strong and as real as possible.” \nSkyfall, released in 2012, became the highest-grossing Bond film in history. \nIt also won two Oscars for its score including Adele’s theme tune and Bafta awards for Outstanding British Film and Best Original Music. Dave Bautista, Christoph Waltz, Monica Bellucci, Daniel Craig, Lea, Seydoux, Sam Mendes, Naomie Harris, Ben Whishaw and Andrew Scott (Ian West/PA) \nDaniel – who joined his co-stars including Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, Christoph Waltz, Andrew Scott, Monica Bellucci, Lea Seydoux and director Sam Mendes for a photocall in London – does many of his own stunts in the 24th instalment of the action series, which included intense chase scenes with former professional mixed martial artist and professional wrestler Dave Bautista. Promoted stories \n“He moves so quickly and is so agile and for me, I think the sequences with him are all the more terrifying because of his presence,” Daniel said. \n“You just want to make the stunts as real and fresh as possible. Dave Bautista, Daniel Craig and Lea Seydoux (Kerstin Joensson/AP) \n“We try to do stuff that we don’t think people have seen before, but having someone like Dave Bautista who spent most of his career being thrown around and throwing other people around, he really knows what he’s doing and he’s incredibly safe.” \nDaniel admitted he accidentally injured Dave – who joins the pantheon of Bond villains as Mr Hinx, a henchman for the criminal organisation Spectre – during some of their sequences together. \nHe said: “Believe me, I was in the other room when I realised I’d done it. I thought he’d come after me but he was so sweet about it. \n“He said, ‘Look, it’s happened before. Don’t worry about it’.” Daniel Craig as Bond (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer) \nDaniel, who made his debut as Bond in 2006′s Casino Royale, also revealed he has no regrets about taking the role – even if it meant losing some much-valued privacy. \n“No, not for a minute,” he said. \n“I was aware of that (the loss of privacy) going in and I’ve remained as private as I possibly can. \n“That, for me, is the most important thing but I’ve also managed to make the movies, which are also incredibly important to me.” Share article \nSpectre opens in UK cinemas on Monday October 26.
