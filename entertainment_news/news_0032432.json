Caro and Kingi pictured in their winning study. Channel 9 Cars For Sale \nTHE Block's leader board shake-up continued with tonight's room reveals. \nTownsville parents Kingi and Caro secured their second straight win, while Luke and Ebony finally find a winning new style. \n\"This week I didn't honestly expect to win,\" Caro said. \nKingi and Caro gave their signature concrete render a rest in their study, power room and laundry but still impressed with their attention to detail. Kingi and Caro's study won the week with its industrial style. Channel 9 \nThe study included a black scaffold shelf and the powder room included a special feature tile wall. \n\"I love the fact they keep showing us something different in the industrial area,\" Shaynna Blaze said. \n\"This couple have the best eye; I just love what they do.\" \nBrother and sister Luke and Ebony final ditched their art deco theme and were rewarded with a second-place finish. \nThey went for a simpler style featuring the classic combination of black and white. Luke and Ebony's monochrome powder room. \n\"I think this week represents a new beginning for them,\" Neale Whitaker said. \n\"You can sense it, a whole new energy.\" \nTheir laundry also featured the most storage and simple, timeless fixtures. \nPenthouse renovators Dean and Shay also bounced back after two underwhelming weeks. \nThe judges were impressed with their polished concrete floor, detailed styling and metallic floor tiles in the powder room. Dean and Shay's stylish penthouse study. Channel 9 \n\"There is just the right amount of glamour here; it's perfect,\" Whitaker said. \n\"I'm feeling they're back on track in terms of styling and envisaging their market and potential buyer.\" \nThe only let down was their laundry, where a feature wall of tilted tiles left the judges' heads spinning. \nTime will tell if their decision to sacrifice space in the study and laundry for a butler's pantry will pay off. \nAndrew and Whitney continue to struggle with consistent styling, confusing the judges with different themes in their three spaces. Andrew and Whitney's Scandinavian study. \nTheir light and bright Scandinavian study was a good start, but it didn't match the dark render in their powder room and laundry. \n\"I'm feeling a bit depressed. It doesn't feel like the powder room that goes with that space,\" Whitaker said \nBlaze also questioned why they would put a bidet in a guest power room rather than the master en-suite. \nThe budget woes of Gold Coast mums Suzi and Vonni look set to continue after they finished last and copped a grilling from the judges. \nRather than replicating the luxurious \"gentleman's club\" feeling of their master bedroom in the study, the judges said the women should scrap the entire room. Judges deem Suzi and Vonni's study a misfire. Channel 9 \n\"Everything in here looks uncomfortable and kind of cheap and that's so not what I felt about the bedroom,\" Whitaker said. \nThe misses continued with the overwhelming inset chandelier in the powder room and the country-style laundry. \n\"I can't remember the last time I saw three rooms that jarred so much,\" Whitaker said. \nThis upcoming week the teams will renovate their living rooms.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:54:50.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
