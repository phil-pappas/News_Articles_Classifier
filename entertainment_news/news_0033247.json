It's surprising,\" a source tells Page Six. \"Jeremy said he's been singing every day for the last few weeks. And he's planning to release an album.\" \nJeremy will be following in the footsteps of fellow Hollywood actor Johnny Depp, who also juggles his movie career with musical projects, and is currently performing with Alice Cooper and Joe Perry in a group called Hollywood Vampires. They released their self-titled debut album last month.
