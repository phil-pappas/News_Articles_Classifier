Snyder ruled Wednesday that the heir of an Egyptian composer didn't have the right to pursue a copyright infringement claim and the case should be tossed out. \nThe nephew of Baligh Hamdi, an Egyptian composer whose 1957 song \"Khosara Khosara\" is partially used in \"Big Pimpin',\" sued Jay Z and producer Timbaland. Flute notes that Hamdi composed appear throughout the Jay Z song. \nThe abrupt end to the case came after the rapper and Timbaland testified about creating the rap hit and their belief that they had valid rights to use the Egyptian song. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Daily Reporter, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:53:01.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
