So I'm committed to go around the world until the end of 2016... \n\"If it wasn't for the anniversary I wouldn't be doing it, simple as that. But my manager made me aware that it would be the 30th anniversary and he said, 'Don't you think you should do a tour?'... (But) I don't plan to do anything again until the 40th anniversary. I mean, I might do some shows but not a big worldwide tour.\" \nThe British band shocked fans with the reunion tour announcement last year, posting a message on their website stating: \"2015 marks the 30th Anniversary of Simply Red and what bet­ter way to cel­eb­rate than to get the band back on the road!\" \nThe trek was initially a series of shows in Europe but the band has since added dates in Australia, New Zealand, and South America.
