She has not made her daughter's name public. \nMulligan was rumoured to be pregnant earlier this year but she did not confirm the report and was not pictured sporting a baby bump. \nEarlier this week, she attended the London premiere of her new movie Suffragette and sparked speculation she had given birth as she was clearly not with-child. \nNow the actress has finally ended the rumours and confirmed she is a new mother. \nFilming an interview with U.K. talk show host Graham Norton on Thursday evening, Mulligan said, \"Yep. It is a girl and she's three weeks old.\" \nThe interview is due to air in the U.K. on Friday.
