Panic-stricken people rushed out of houses and buildings in north India as the tremors unleashed by the quake lasted for almost a minute. The earthquake, with its epicentre in the Hindukush mountain range, sent ripples across several states like Jammu and Kashmir, National Capital Region (NCR), Punjab, Uttarakhand and Rajasthan. In J-K capital Srinagar, residents said they saw the buildings “swinging” in a scary reminder of the devastating quake of 2005. Meanwhile, immediately following the earthquake, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he has asked for an urgent assessment of the situation and also offered assistance to Afghanistan and Pakistan. ”Heard about strong earthquake in Afghanistan-Pakistan region whose tremors have been felt in parts of India. I pray for everyone’s safety,” the PM said on Twitter. ”I have asked for an urgent assessment and we stand ready for assistance where required, including Afghanistan & Pakistan,” he added. \nModified Date: October 26, 2015 5:38 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T14:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:18:49.867+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
