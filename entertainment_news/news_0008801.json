It’s been fun.” \nFor the 32-year-old Oliver — the band’s co-founder, co-manager and co-producer — it’s also been a major musical shift from his old gig with post-grunge outfit My Darkest Days. \n“Definitely,” he says. “But you know, I’ve always just been a fan of good music. It never really mattered to me what genre it was. I’ve never been interested in limiting myself. I like anything from pop to rock to country.” \nNo surprise, then, that you’ll hear all of those influences and more on Till the Wheels Come Off, a radio-friendly album more influenced by the party-hearty sound of artists like Florida Georgia Line and Luke Bryan than the classic Nashville brand of twang. With the album available this weekend, Oliver — whose bandmates include Brandon Scott, Trevor MacLeod and John and Justin Lester, sons of bluegrass vet Emory Lester — called up to chat about the differences between rock and country, staying positive and being bros. \nWhy do you think this band has taken off so fast? \nHonestly, I don’t know. The only thing I can think of is that we had the right sound at the right time. It’s something different. There’s a lot of music out there that is just the same-old same-old. And we knew we had to have something different. But we weren’t trying to be different, you know? We just got songs that we liked. But we do sound different than other things on the radio. \nIs that due to your diverse backgrounds? \nAbsolutely. Having all the different guys and what they bring to the table, it’s truly unique. All of us have a bit of the rock background, a few of us have a country influence. And when we put it together, it comes out sounding like Cold Creek County. But it all comes down to having a good song with a good lyric and a good melody. \nYou also have a sound that mixes traditional and modern. \nIt’s a little bit of everything, which I’m always a fan of. I never like listening to a record where every song was kind of like the last one. We wanted to make sure we were all across the table, so that it would reach out to not only us personally but to listeners. \nThe lyrics are also very upbeat. That seems missing from rock these days. \nYeah, it really is. I have nothing bad to say about the rock world. But honestly, where I’m at in my life, I just love the positivity of country music. And really, we’re just guys who like to have fun. No one has an ego. The best thing about our band is that we can go to work all day and then go out for a beer at night. We are actually friends and we just like goofing around and not taking ourselves too serious. \nHow do you feel about being branded as bro-country? \nWell, it doesn’t bother me. We knew it was going to happen. But we’re more on the rockier side of it than the hip-hop side. But you can label us whatever you want: We’re just going to make music that we love, and that’s pretty much the end of it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T19:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:54:51.143+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
