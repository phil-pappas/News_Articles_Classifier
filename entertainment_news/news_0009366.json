VW chief Martin Winterkorn resigned after the scandal broke in the U.S., saying he was not aware of any wrongdoing on his part. \nEwing's still-untitled book will explore the \"more, better, faster\" ethos and how it played into the scandal. \nDiCaprio, an active environmentalist, would serve as a producer on the project. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:48:19.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
