Kerik allows people to refer to him as the “Commish” implying he is still the NYPD Police Commissioner. He is actually former Federal Prisoner number 84888-054. His Federal Probation doesn’t even end until October 15, 2016 (a year from now). \nYet every time he’s on a show as an expert and the anchor refers to him as “Commish,” he has the opportunity to correct them – but he doesn’t. The result is that the viewing public in the United States think that Bernard Kerik is the current New York City Police Commissioner. \nWhen he was more famous for being a criminal than for being on the right side of the law. Yet the part of his life he keeps promoting on television, is his time when he was police commissioner. And every time a television show books him as an expert they are complicit in the conspiracy to use a felon as a law enforcement expert. \nWhile on the supposed “right side of the law,” he always exhibited extremely aggressive behavior. It was not so much a display of masculinity or the fact that he was a cop, it was more likened to the behavior more associated with a mobster. \nAfter being the NYPD Police Commissioner, his true behavior became publicly known and he no longer had to pretend. That made him particularly dangerous. \nKerik was charged for many of his crimes (but not all of them) and he wound up in federal prison. \nThe networks are well aware that many of their speakers are inappropriately chosen but they do it anyway. \nFor several years now we’ve been alarmed to see GlobalGrind’s editor, Michael Skolnik repeatedly being called upon to speak for the black community. \nUsing Skolnik to speak for the black community is most especially offensive because he is known for writing multiple articles about how he doesn’t face the dangers blacks face because he’s a white man. \nHis accomplishments are 1) being a film producer and 2) being a television personality. \nHe used those two “skills” to get himself a seat on the Trayvon Martin Foundation. \nHe’s a white man exploiting the plight of vulnerable black people that have just lost their children by stepping in as though he could do anything about it. \nYet on that thin experience alone he has brazenly appeared on news broadcasts talking about the black experience and racial issues as though merely working for Russell Simmons authorizes him to speak for the entire black community. \nI have never come across one black man or woman telling me that they appreciate Skolnik speaking for them. And they assure me that no black person would authorize Skolnik or anyone else in his position to speak for them. \nIn this day and age, it is shameless for a white man to presume that he can appear in the place of a black man on television or radio, speaking about the black experience – something he has never lived or knows nothing about. \nAnd no one seemed to have a problem with the fact that he is not at all black. Why? Because he made the white people that booked him on the show feel “comfortable” with his “white privilege.” \nThe networks repeatedly invited him (a white man) to speak on matters that don’t at all affect him and not being a lawyer, they don’t affect his clients either. \nHe’s just a white guy that happens to have been hired by Russell Simmons, a millionaire as a “political” expert. \nAnd it is possible that he may be a great political expert, but he is not black, he should not represent blacks and the behavior in itself is out of line considering this is 2015 and not 1915. \nIf the networks use Kerik, a felon still on Federal Probation until October 2016, as a law enforcement expert and a white man, instead of an expert on crime, it should not surprise anyone that they would use Michael Skolnik, a white man as a “black expert.” \nWhy should anyone be surprised when Wayne Simmons presented himself as a CIA Operative? \nAnd who did the Networks and Hollywood call when they needed to interview an expert on moral standards for the last 50 years? \nNot Billy Graham or Rev. Jake. \nThey called Bill Cosby. 1 Current Visitors On This Page CRYPTOCURRENCY COMING TO COMMODITIES SOON Commodities are powered by Investing.com RECENT ARTICLES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T09:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T01:17:16.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
