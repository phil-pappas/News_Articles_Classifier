Their powerful information allowed her to understand the importance of an enhanced connection to Spirit, and gave her the specific steps necessary to prepare for this connection through the focused use of meditation and sleep.\n“Also included,” shares Francis, “are verbatim Quote: s from some of the channeling sessions in which my guides clarified and underscored for me the essential role the Earth plays in the universe.” She illustrates the guidance given regarding the building of spiritual balance and strength, and how the incorporation of these steps will cause profoundly positive and lasting effects on the general populace, which she says in turn will cause a rebalancing and stabilization of the Earth.\nThroughout “Steps to Ascension,” Francis provides readers with the inspirational information she has learned in the hopes that they will develop the spiritual strength necessary to participate fully in the rebalancing and fortification of the Earth.\n“Steps to Ascension”\nBy Sydney Francis\nSoftcover | 5.5 x 8.5 in | 52 pages | ISBN 9781504335430\nE-Book | 52 pages | ISBN 9781504335447\nAvailable at Amazon and Barnes & Noble\nAbout the Author\nSydney Francis has lived a life of remarkable timing and profound synchronicity.
