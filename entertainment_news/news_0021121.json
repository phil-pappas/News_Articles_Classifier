SCAD has more 2,000 alumni working in productions in the state of Georgia right now. \n“We are really becoming more international,” he says. “But we’re also very focused about how Georgia is leading the way in the film industry.” \nAs always, the festival features some new opportunities in addition to regular audience favorites. \n“There are some new elements we’re excited about,” Filson says. “Our Conversation Series happens every night after the feature screenings at the Trustees or Lucas theaters. \n“Those conversations are with the primary filmmakers and primary cast members. We’ll kick off right away Saturday evening with a premiere screening of ‘Suffragette.’ We’ve got the director and producer right after the screening. \n“This year, we have more films produced and directed by women,” he says. “That’s a significant development for the film festival.” \nAnother highlight will be the Georgia Film and TV Production panel Oct. 27. \n“What’s key is that we’ve got the best of elements from previous festivals with exciting new elements that we’ve added,” Filson says. “As always, we have incredible celebrities, incredible films and exciting work to share with our 50,000-plus audience members. \n“We’ve refined and come to a clear understanding of what audiences are looking for and what our students need. We started the Docs to Watch series last year and it was tremendously successful. \n“We’ve garnered major media attention internationally to focus on Docs to Watch and bring in more documentary films for people to watch,” he says. “The Amy Winehouse documentary is probably the one people are most familiar with.” \nThe second annual Docs to Watch Directors Roundtable will be Oct. 25, hosted by Scott Fienberg of The Hollywood Reporter with directors Evgeny Afineevsky, Kirby Dick, Liz Garbus, Bobcat Goldthwait, Robert Gordon, Matthew Heineman, Asif Kapadia, Crystal Moselle, Morgan Neville, Geeta Patel and Ravi Patel participating. \n“While that structure is not new, all the films are new,” Filson says. “It’s created a tremendous excitement about the Savannah Film Festival. \n“This Docs to Watch series is becoming a major element in the awards season. That’s the value of the Savannah Film Festival. \n“This year, at more than any time in festival history, filmmakers are looking at the festival as a major player in placing their films for major recognition,” he says. “That’s exactly where we want to be.” \nStill more documentaries will be presented at Signature Screenings, including “Tab Hunter Confidential.” \n“People have their own familiarity with Tab Hunter,” Filson says. “Because of the film, they have the opportunity for amazing insight into an A-list celebrity. It’s brought a whole new story and created a lot of excitement.” \nThis year, 118 films are being screened. \n“That’s the secret sauce of SCAD, the element of why we do the film festival,” Filson says. “We have the premiere screenings, the A-list celebrities, the great dynamic films, all integral to the success of the film festival. \n“The heart of the festival is the opportunity to bring these individuals together with our students, to showcase our facilities and get our students jobs. It is SCAD’s ability to bring the industry together with our students. \n“That’s why the film festival exists,” Filson says. “From our point of view, the exceptional films, the extra talent is part of the opportunity for the industry to come together with SCAD.” \nAs always, the festival will feature celebrities. \n“We’ve got a really nice mix of celebrities across the board,” Filson says. “Our Lifetime Achievement honoree is Meg Ryan , who is bringing her directing debut to the festival. \n“ Olivia Wilde will be here for the screening of ‘Meadowland.’ Saoirse Ronan will be here with her new film ‘Brooklyn.’ \n“These are major contenders for the Academy Award,” Filson says. “We are honored to be able to screen them.” \nTelevision personalities also will attend, including Alfie Allen from the hit series “Game of Thrones.” \n“ Norman Reedus of ‘The Walking Dead’ and several other guests have been with us over the years,” Filson says. “They love coming to Savannah and being part of the Savannah Film Festival. \n“Miles Teller is coming back. He was one of our early film festival guests and also loves the film festival. \n“Alan Cumming is coming back,” Filson says. “That speaks volumes, when these folks say they originally came because they were honored, but want to come back because they love the Savannah Film Festival.” \nNoted film critic Leonard Maltin is on the jury for the Savannah Film Festival and also works with students when he’s in Savannah. \n“We ask our jurors to get involved with the students and they do,” Filson says. “Roger Ebert came to the festival several years ago and was an absolute delight. Having those people return is a wonderful statement about the film festival.” \nSome of the films are in competition at the fest. \n“Those are the screenings that sell out the fastest,” Filson says. “We’ve had to move the Docs to Watch to the Lucas because of the demand. \n“What I’m so excited about is the sophistication level of Savannah Film Festival audiences,” he says. “These are people with elite tastes who are looking at a broad range and embracing them.” \nAbove all, although the public can enjoy the festival, it really is designed for SCAD students. \n“It brings the opportunity for our students to network and move forward in their professional careers because of the festival,” Filson says. “It is truly the most rewarding aspect of the Savannah Film Festival. \n“We were out at Disney Pixar studios last week,” he says. “We saw alumni who graduated two years ago that made connections through the Savannah Film Festival. You can’t go to Georgia film studios, let alone New York or California, without meeting SCAD alumni.” \nThe Writers Guild Foundation will host its “Scribble to Screen” panels and exhibit at the festival from Oct. 24-26. Three writers will appear Oct. 25. \nAt 11 a.m., Jason Fuchs, screenwriter of “Pan,” will speak about the creation of his script. At 2 p.m., Holly Schlesinger and Nora Smith of the FOX animated show “Bob’s Burgers” will speak. \nThe exhibit will feature development materials from Disney’s “Beauty and the Beast” from the personal collection of writer Linda Woolverton; William Cameron Menzies’ 1933 “Alice in Wonderland” illustrated screenplay; the only existing copy of Lawrence Kasdan’s handwritten first draft of “The Empire Strikes Back”; bound TV, video game and film scripts, including the films “Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil” and “Forrest Gump”; iPads loaded with scripts from TV shows such as “Mad Men,” “The Walking Dead” and “Game of Thrones”; and all the notes and materials showcased at the “Pan” and “Bob’s Burgers” panels. \nIn addition to screenings and panels, the film festival also offers workshops. \nAndra Reeve Raab, SCAD’s department chair of performing arts and director of casting, has organized workshops for the festival. \n“My background was director of casting for CBS Television for over a decade,” Raab says. “I came here and opened the casting office here at SCAD. \n“I started to work with students. We have 192 actors here and I was training them to prep for auditions. \n“We’ve been putting students up for movies and television roles,” she says. “Productions are filming here and casting agents are saying there’s a limited amount of actors here and I’ve been shouting, ‘We can take care of your needs here.’” \nRaab is putting together workshops for the film festival that are specifically geared to performing arts students. \n“We bring in stars and they do master classes for the students,” she says. “In the past, we had Alec Baldwin, who talked about what it is to be a working actor in very hands-on workshops. \n“They get to ask all the questions they wanted to about the acting business,” Raab says. “Last year, we had Mike Myers and he did an improv workshop. The students got to get up and work with him and he directed them.” \nIn addition to actors, casting directors and talent agents also come from Los Angeles and New York City to do hands-on workshops. \n“They’re geared toward teaching our students what casting agents look for,” Raab says. “It’s an incredible opportunity for students to connect with the biggest people in the business.” \nAmong this year’s workshop participants are actors Olivia Wilde and Alfie Allen and casting director Julie Schubert of “House of Cards.” \nWhile some workshops are open only to SCAD students, there are panels that are open to the public. \n“Meg Ryan is doing a question-and-answer on Thursday,” Raab says. “That gives the public the opportunity to ask her questions. Olivia Wilde and director Reed Morano will do a question-and-answer with the public after their screening.” \nIn the end, the festival is really a benefit for SCAD students. \n“It is such an incredible opportunity for our students to really end up with all of this knowledge from the inside,” Raab says. “It is wonderful to be able to ask questions of these people who have just started out and skyrocketed, like Alfie. \n“Some of the rising stars have been some of our students’ favorites, like Abigail Breslin and Asa Butterfield,” Raab says. “These are their contemporaries who are out there doing this and it gives them a real sense of what they can be in the business.” Sections:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:26:27.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
