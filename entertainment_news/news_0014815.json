He tweetedm \"For years we wanted an overseas market. Rangitaranga created it. Hats off to them! To sustain that is going to be a big effort.\" (Sic)\nInterestingly, records of number of screenings of Kannada films abroad seem to be reinforcing what Chaitanya has said. Kannada films like Uppi 2, and even Chaitanya's Aatagara are in the run among the top few films that are being screened out of the country. RangiTaranga, directed by debutant Anup Bhandari, seems to have broken quite a few previous records and created new ones right from the time the film released earlier this year. The film stars a host of newcomers, thereby breaking the notion that it takes an established star to make a success out of a movie.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:17:11.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
