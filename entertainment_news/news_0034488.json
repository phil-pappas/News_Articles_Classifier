They say Rodricus Crawford was wrongly sentenced to death by a Caddo Parish jury. \nDuring the penalty phase of the trial against Crawford, District Attorney Dale Cox referred to passages where Jesus Christ talks of punishing people who harm children by putting a millstone around their necks and throwing them into the sea. \nThe religious leaders spoke out against Cox in front of the Louisiana Supreme Court building in New Orleans. \nTheir legal brief said Cox's Bible references were both unconstitutional and a misuse of Scripture. \nSound: \n279-v-34-(Steve Coleman, AP religion editor)--Religious leaders of several faiths say it was illegal for a Louisiana prosecutor to invoke the Bible when he called on a jury to impose the death penalty.

The legislation would allow judges to impose sentences that are less than federal mandatory minimums in some cases. It would eliminate mandatory life sentences for three-time, nonviolent drug offenders, reducing those minimum sentences to 25 years. \nYates said the current system is costly, affects families and contributes to loss of confidence in the justice system. \nThe legislation is supported by Justice Fellowship, the advocacy arm of the late Chuck Colson's Prison Fellowship Ministries. Justice Fellowship Executive Director Craig DeRoche applauded the sentencing reforms and added that faith-based programs in prisons have helped change criminal behavior and reduce recidivism. \nSound: \n278-w-33-(Steve Coleman, AP religion editor, with Deputy Attorney General Sally Quillian Yates, and Craig DeRoche, executive director of Prison Fellowship Ministries' Justice Fellowship)--The Obama administration is signaling support for bipartisan Senate legislation that would reduce prison sentences for some nonviolent drug offenders.

(AP) — A Seattle-area school district says it is negotiating with the football coach who continues to pray after games after district officials asked him to keep religion off the field. \nBremerton High School assistant coach Joe Kennedy knelt as his players left the field Friday night and prayed. The Kitsap Sun reports that players from the other team and others joined him. \nThe school district says in a statement issued Monday that Kennedy's employment status is unchanged. School officials are reviewing the events of Friday night and are talking to the coach's lawyers. \nDistrict spokeswoman Patty Glaser says the goal is to arrive at an understanding with Kennedy that will respect the rights of all community members and follow the law. \n$1900 DELIVERY TIP \nAlaska church tips pizza delivery driver $1,900 \nANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — Two weeks after a church congregation in Ohio tipped a pizza delivery driver $1,000, a church in Alaska has upped the stakes. \nAnchorage television station KTVA reports that Ken Felber has been a pizza delivery driver for 14 years. When he delivered a pizza to Chugach Covenant Church on Sunday, the pastor asked him what was his best-ever tip. \nWhen he replied $100, pastor Dan Krause asked him, \"How does a tip of $1,900 sound?\" \nFelber was very mindful of his surroundings and replied: \"Oh, heck no!\" He says it's the coolest thing that's ever happened to him. \nPastor Krause says this was an opportunity to do something small that would really have a big impact on somebody's life. \nFelber has no plans to splurge since he needs new snow tires and has medical expenses. But he does plan to take his wife out for a good spaghetti dinner. \nSound: \n303-a-02-(Ken Felber, pizza deliverer who got $1900 tip from a church, in interview)-\"happened to me\"-Ken Felber, pizza deliverer who got $1900 tip from a church, says it caught him by surprise.

LOUIS (AP) — Someone has been setting fire to predominantly black churches in the St. Louis area. \nPolice are looking for suspects and a motive. St. Louis Fire Capt. Garon Mosby would not rule out the possibility of a hate crime directed at churches or at African-Americans. \nSince Oct. 8, fire has damaged six churches, all within a few miles of each other in north St. Louis city and county. In each case, the front doors were set on fire. Damage has ranged from a few hundred dollars at one church to the near destruction of another. \nFive of the churches are predominantly black and one is racially mixed. \nThe fires add to racial angst in an area still reeling from a police shooting and unrest in Ferguson last year. \nSound: \n302-c-13-(Jim Salter, AP correspondent)-\"since October 8th\"-AP correspondent Jim Salter reports authorities want to find out who is responsible for fires at predominantly black churches in the St. Louis area.

(AP) — A 17-year-old boy who was beaten inside his upstate New York church in an attack that killed his older brother has been released from the hospital and is expected to testify against two suspects in the case. \nNew Hartford police say Christopher Leonard was released from the hospital over the weekend and is under the supervision of Oneida County Child Protective Services. \nPolice say he and 19-year-old Lucas Leonard were beaten by their parents, sister and three other church members inside the Word of Life Christian Church on Oct. 11. Authorities believe the attack was prompted by the brothers' desire to leave the church. \nAll six have pleaded not guilty. \nChristopher Leonard is set to testify Wednesday at a hearing on assault charges against his sister and a man. \nVATICAN-FAMILIES \nPope's family synod: No changes, but everything has changed \nVATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis' global summit on family issues has been shaken up by his weekend speech calling for nothing less than a revolution in the concept of the Catholic Church itself. \nFrancis told the assembled cardinals and bishops that the church is not a top-down organization with the pope in charge but rather an inverted pyramid where the pope is underneath and in service to the \"holy faithful people of God.\" \nHe called for a \"healthy decentralization\" of authority from Rome to local bishops' conferences, and said the papacy itself should be rethought, with the pope guiding the church but really just one bishop among many, one Catholic among many. \nThe synod is not expected to endorse any changes to church doctrine on homosexuality or whether civilly remarried Catholics can receive Communion. But what Francis does with the synod's final paper is up to him. He can publish it, ignore it or use it as a basis for a document of his own. \nBRITAIN-EXTREMISM \nBritain to seize passports of teens at risk of extremism \nLONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister David Cameron has unveiled new plans to combat extremism, expanding the government's power to seize passports from young people at risk of traveling abroad to join groups like Islamic State. \nCameron challenged Muslim communities to \"own\" the problem, arguing that those who reject extremism are the key to driving out radicals in schools, universities, local councils, charities and prisons. He defined the fight against Islamist extremism as one of the great struggles of the era. \nMuslim organizations rejected Cameron's \"One Nation\" strategy, warning that it risked alienating Muslims and could be counter-productive. \nHuman rights advocates expressed concern about the lack of detail in the proposals, particularly in regard to the definition of extremism. \nMIDEAST-CLASH OF NARRATIVES \nClash of narratives drives events in Holy Land \nCAIRO (AP) — The clashes between Israelis and Palestinians in the Holy Land are not just physical; the two sides cannot agree on what they see, how they got there, who is to blame or where they should go. \nTo many Israelis, the wave of knifings betrays a hatred of Jews by a Palestinian populace that is easily incited to violence by fanatics dreaming up conspiracy theories about Zionist plots to take over their sacred Jerusalem mosque. \nTo Palestinians, the violent rage of lone-wolf attackers was inevitable after almost a half-century of Israeli occupation in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, after peace talks collapsed last year and after Israelis re-elected a prime minister who seems wedded to the status quo. \nWhere Israelis see attackers killed in self-defense against what headlines call the \"wave of terrorism,\" Palestinians tend to see martyrs. \nINDIA-TOURISTS HARASSED \nTourists harassed in India for man's Hindu goddess tattoo \nBANGALORE, India (AP) — An Australian couple reports being harassed at a restaurant in India by people who objected to a tattoo of a Hindu goddess on the man's leg. \nA crowd gathered around Matt Keith and his girlfriend while they were having lunch Saturday in the southern city of Bangalore, complaining that the tattoo on the man's shin offended their religion. \nKeith said in a Facebook post that police took them to a police station where he was forced to write a letter of apology before they were allowed to leave. \nPolice officer Sandeep Patil said Monday that an inquiry was ordered to investigate the incident and its handling by local police. \nIndia has seen a rise in incidents of religious intolerance over the past year, with Hindu nationalists trying to create a more Hindu-centric country. \nKASHMIR-BEEF DISPUTE \nTeen's death in Indian Kashmir mob attack sets off protests \nSRINAGAR, India (AP) — A general strike and curfew has shut down Indian-controlled Kashmir following the death of a Muslim teenager who was attacked by a Hindu mob over rumors of cows being slaughtered. \nHindus consider cows to be sacred, and slaughtering the animals is banned in most Indian states. \nBusinesses, schools and shops were closed Monday to denounce the killing. State authorities canceled all university and college examinations on Monday fearing protests. \nThousands of people who attended Zahid Rasool's funeral in southern Kashmir shouted slogans demanding freedom from Indian rule. \nPolice officer Danish Rana said nine people have been arrested in connection with Rasool's death.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:33:26.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
