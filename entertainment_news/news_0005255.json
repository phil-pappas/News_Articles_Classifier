The endless list of companies gaming the system is a direct result of the WMBE program, and should therefore be ended as suggested by Spencer Lawton in his column (“Spencer Lawton: School board: It’s time to phase out minority preferences,” Sept. 1).\nHonesty, ethics and hard work are the principles attributed to successful business of any type or career choice. Minorities of all descriptions have been successful in their careers all over this country because of the inherent will to do so.\nI do not think candidates Dr. Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina got where they are because of the 35 percent rule.\nAs an added benefit to taxpayers, the format used by the Georgia Educational Authority as directed by John Sims should be implemented by the school board in lieu of the construction manager at risk. This format held all parties involved accountable in the process: owner, architect, engineer, contractor, subcontractor and vendors. Budget, time and low bidder were defined.\nQualified A/E firms and general contractors over the state of Georgia participated in this process because it was fair and it worked. The taxpayer received 100 percent value for the work.\nJOHN E. SHEPPARD JR.\nTybee Island\nWe often overlook the sacrifice of our veterans\nThe holidays will soon be upon us, and we’ll all be wrapped up in the hustle, bustle and stress that they bring. But there is a date just ahead of Thanksgiving that I wonder how many actually notice — Veterans Day on Nov. 11.\nEven with constant reminders, we too often overlook the sweat, blood and sacrifice our veterans and their families have made and continue to make. One place to honor such is at The National Museum of the Mighty Eighth Air Force in Pooler.\nThis museum shows, often with brutal honesty, just how harsh and deadly war is. The people who work there are rightfully proud of the museum.\nIt has been many years since I visited there. My 17-year-old daughter was a baby in arms.\nBut I still remember the exhibits and the pride the caretakers took in this wonderful museum. I encourage anyone living in or near the Savannah area — or planning to visit — to stop by The National Museum of the Mighty Eighth Air Force on Bourne Avenue in Pooler.\nTake pride in our military and support them.\nCHARLES KIMBROUGH\nSylvania\nJoin us for\nWorld Polio Day\nIn these days of constant tragic news, I write to speak about a bright and remarkable effort that has been moving forward in our community and around the world for almost 40 years: the drive to eradicate polio.\nFor those who might not know what it is, polio is a crippling and potentially deadly infectious disease, which can lead to permanent disability and even death. At the height of the 1952 polio epidemic, nearly 60,000 cases with more than 3,000 deaths were reported in the United States alone. It would come in waves during the summer months, striking mostly elementary school children.\nDespite the development of a vaccine in 1955, it has still been maiming and killing people around the globe, even into the first decades of the 21st century.\nIn 1979, Rotary International undertook the beginnings of what became a worldwide immunization effort to eradicate this disease. The western hemisphere was declared polio free in 1994.\nThe World Health Organization announced just last month that Nigeria has been certified polio free. Only two countries remain: Pakistan and Afghanistan. When completed, the eradication of polio will be one of the most significant achievements in public health since the eradication of smallpox.\nToday, please join more than 500 members of eight local Rotary Clubs in the Savannah area, along with nearly 34,000 clubs across the world, for the third annual World Polio Day. Rotary and UNICEF will host an event in New York City, which will stream live.\nYou can find out more about polio eradication, as well as information about the live event at www.endpolio.org.\nTODD FREESEMANN\nSavannah\nChristianity and the Republican Party\nI guess I am a Liberal Baptist for I question what the Conservative Christian right thinks and what they truly seek. I was told I could not be a Christian and not be a Republican, and I think a lot of folks believe that.\nI once was asked how I could be against school prayer and I said I would not want my grandchildren exposed to Islam. If you give the Christians the right to pray, then the Muslims have the same right. I was told why we were a Christian nation and the majority — so much for our Constitution. Gay marriage is a done deal and no court would open that legal can of worms.\nI want to know what they are truly after on abortion. We have more than 90 percent of our population who believe in exceptions on abortions, so there is no way to get a law that follows the Bible. Would not Christians have to fight just as hard against a law giving exceptions — maybe even harder — to avoid anyone thinking we were compromising the Bible?\nI am one of the 90 percent for I have seen enough of the mother’s life to say no man, government or law has the right to interfere on that decision, yet the day my faith is willing to accept anything other than what the Bible says, I will no longer be a Baptist.\nI believe my God does not accept the lesser of two evils, nor is it better than nothing, nor does my God comprise if He did. Why did Jesus have to die on the cross?\nSo I ask, what do you truly seek? Is it truly about Christianity, or politics and tax cuts?\nROBERT L RAILEY\nSavannah", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-23T18:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:12:37.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
