The oldest daughter of President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama is photographed standing in front of a table with several red plastic cups lined up on it. It's unclear if Malia who dressed casually took part in the beer pong game. The picture was taken during her visit to Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island last weekend and reportedly shared on Snapchat by one of the students at the party. Malia Obama is heading to college next year. She has visited Columbia University, New York University, Barnard College, Stanford University, and the University of California. During her tour at Brown, she allegedly stayed at a dorm room in Morris Hall. Multiple individuals have since tweeted about her stay at the university. One wrote, \"When you're at a party and secret services show up and everyone freaks out but it just ends up being Malia Obama.\" Another posted, \"Saw Malia Obama playing beer pong at a party last night. #Casual. The most casual thing I've ever seen.\" Neither Brown University nor the White House has commented on it. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Required fields are marked with *", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T20:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T21:48:51.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
