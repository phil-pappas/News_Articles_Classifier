Monday night's concert at The Paradise Rock Club in Boston surely filled the bill on both counts, delighting about 700 fans with 27 songs over nearly two hours. Old 97s released their tenth album, \"Most Messed Up,\" last spring, and it was a solid effort, even if it didn't sell as well as some others have. Currently the quartet is on a 30-date national tour, and if the new album provided seven of last night's tunes, it wasn't like the band was bending over backwards to promote it. There were songs from virtually every era of the Old 97s history, since they began in 1993. In fact, while praising the opening band, The Banditos, Old 97s singer Rhett Miller noted that the younger band is on Bloodshot Records, where Old 97s had been twenty years ago. To salute that anniversary, the quartet played three songs from \"Wreck Your Life,\" their album of that time. Little surprises like that made for a fun evening, as the foursome didn't just play a predictable set of its greatest hits or most popular cuts. Monday's set, for example, did not include Old 97s faves like \"Victoria\" or \"Roller Skate Skinny,\" but newer numbers like \"Nashville\" and \"Most in the Summertime,\" (from Miller's solo career) have the potential to become all-time Old 97s classics. Like many bands, Old 97s have been through periods of hiatus, as members pursue other things, and it's not a fulltime gig for any of them. Miller has four albums out under his own name, while bassist Murry Hammond has his own solo CD. But with drummer Phil Peeples and lead guitarist Ken Bethea, the original lineup is still widely viewed as one of the most potent outfits ever in \"alternative country,\" or what is now called Americana. Uncle Tupelo and Whiskeytown may be long gone, but this is one group where country heart and soul delivered with rockin' dynamics still rules. And the skewed wit and wisdom in Miller's lyrics is one of rock's vastly underrated treasures. Old 97s' raggedy charm was evident early on \"King of All the World,\" as the tune roared along, seemingly inches away from spinning out of control. The lines of \"The Streets of Where I'm From\" highlighted Miller's ability to tug heartstrings while also slipping in humorous asides, as the ramshackle country-rock suggested the quartet might be sons of The Faces. Hammond sang lead on the comically rapid-fire \"West Texas Teardrops,\" displaying a nice voice even as the band threatened to turn the shuffle into a tempest. The title \"Wasted\" might suggest other things, but the song itself is a poignant view on life as a musician, and Miller made it connect Monday night. \"Nashville\" is also an inside perspective of a certain kind of musician's life, but more cynical, almost an indictment of what country music has become, and Monday's version raged on wonderfully. Page 2 of 2 - Old 97s aren't above poking fun at themselves and their past, and \"Big Brown Eyes\" got a really dramatic reading that included Miller vocal howls that made the lost love tune a hoot, even as half the crowd sang along. \"The Other Shoe\" was a cool nugget from that \"Wreck Your Life\" era, and the Jon Langford cover \"Over the Cliff\" was another pell mell shuffle. Hammond again showed he has impressive pipes, singing the lead on \"The Color of a Lonely Heart Is Blue.\" A rather off-kilter arrangement helped emphasize Miller's lyrics to \"Longer Than You've Been Alive,\" to good effect as he intoned a variation on the baseball phrase, \"rock 'n' roll's been very good to me..\" The wacky paean to the rock life, \"Niteclub,\" was a big crowd favorite, naturally, and the blitzkrieg charge through \"Let the Idiot Speak\" right after it kept the night surging to its finish. But the midtempo \"Designs on You\" offered more subtle pleasures: how can you resist a line like \"standing at the corner of Sixth and Forever After..\" The rollicking examination of love and life and their disappointments, \"(What's So Great About the) Barrier Reef\" could be the closest thing Old 97s have to an anthem, or perhaps a mission statement, and Monday's take was superb. \"Every Night is Friday Night Without You\" proved those hearts are still on their sleeves, despite its full blast, rockin' roar. And the regular set closer, \"Most Messed Up,\" from the last album, was a properly rowdy finale. The four-song encore session started with Miller doing his lovely ballad \"Most in the Summertime\" solo and on acoustic guitar. Hammond joined him and took the lead vocal on \"Valentine,\" as Miller provided wordless harmonies, simply cooing along on the choruses. The gloriously thumping \"Let's Get Drunk and Get It On\" led into the beloved chestnut \"Timebomb,\" still a jittery and double-timed thrill ride. More than two decades on, Old 97s still have the fire.
