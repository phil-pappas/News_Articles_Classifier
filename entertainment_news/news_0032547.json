The scheme allegedly took place throughout the city and suburbs over the past year.\nU-Haul moving customers were offered payments to claim false breakdowns and request towing, according to the lawsuit. While U-Haul roadside assistance numbers are listed on the contract and posted on the equipment, customers engaged the named towing companies, none of which were authorized by U-Haul, the company claimed. As the incidents mounted, U-Haul began its own investigation. The suit doesn't say how many vehicles were towed and stored.\n\"U-Haul filed the lawsuit after an extensive investigation following an increasing number of U-Haul rental equipment had been towed in the region under suspicious circumstances,\" Steve Hansen, a U-Haul vice president, said in a statement.\nOne customer participated in three towing incidents, according to the suit. None of the customers were named in the suit.\nSeveral cooperated with the investigation. In a September 2014 incident, a customer identified as S.P. said she was offered $500 by defendant Evans Towing and Recovery to rent a vehicle from a U-Haul facility in northwest suburban Hoffman Estates, and then claim damage requiring their towing services.\nThe customer reported she backed the vehicle into a light pole but later admitted to U-Haul that there had been no damage requiring towing or vehicle storage.\nIn addition to the towing and storage bill, when U-Haul regained custody of the vehicle from the South Side towing company, it found the vehicle's tires had been replaced with older, cheaper tires, according to the lawsuit.\nReached by phone Thursday, a person who identified himself as a supervisor with Evans Towing declined to comment.\nOther defendants include Traffic Recovery, Ambition Towing, Automotive Transport Specialist, ATI Recovery, South Side Towing and Affordable Towing and Recovery, all in Chicago or the south suburbs.\nU-Haul of Illinois is seeking more than $50,000 in damages and injunctive relief to prevent the defendants from towing their vehicles again.\nFounded in 1945, Arizona-based U-Haul has more than 20,000 locations in the U.S. and Canada.\nrchannick@tribpub.com\nTwitter @RobertChannick\n Business", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5629362a/turbine/ct-uhaul-towing-fraud-1023-biz-20151022"], "published": "2015-10-22T22:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:24:22.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
