When the boy responded that he didn't know, the man hit him with an arrow.\nThere's already been a second attack in as many days in the same area. Police have said they're investigating the attacks and have recovered an arrow from the scene.\nWhile it all might sound hilarious, residents are worried. \"I mean I've heard gunshots, I've heard paintballs, ice, everything. An arrow is just weird,\" said Tara Karlowicz of Nanticoke.\nWho knows?
