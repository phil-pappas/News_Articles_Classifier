Escape from New York”.\nThe claimants had asked for damages of €3m, but in the event the court ordered Europacorp to pay out €80,000, of which €20,000 went to Carpenter directly, €10,000 to Escape from New York co-scripter Nick Castle, and €50,000 to the film’s rights holder StudioCanal.\nEuropaCorp is appealing against the ruling, with a spokesperson telling AFP it was a “hindering of the freedom of artistic creation”. “[The plot ideas are] part of the common stock of cinema and the principle of convicting someone... is unacceptable, even if the court only granted three percent of the damages demanded.”\nThis article was written by Andrew Pulver, for theguardian.com on Friday 16th October 2015 18.20 Europe/London guardian.co.uk © Guardian News and Media Limited 2010", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/4658593/04-noNetworks-noAdsense-mpu&sz=300x250&t=vertical%3Dhome&mob=js&c=", "http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/03/01/poweredbyguardian.png", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/4658593/04-noNetworks-noAdsense-mpu&sz=300x250&t=vertical%3Dhome&mob=js&c=", "http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/apr/22/lockout-guy-pearce-review", "http://gu.com/p/4dcft"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:17:25.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
