He also said that when he had read the film's script, he loved the whole idea of it. In a recent interview, Rahman had said that he was a \"zero in sports\" and that \"he composed music for Pele without knowing him\". \"The music I'm making is on the personality, it's an emotion, you're not physically involved. To follow sports, it requires energy and mehnat (hard work). And for me, all my work and all my energy is from music,\" says Rahman. The biopic on Pele is titled \"Pele\" and is being written and directed by Jeff Zimbalist and Michael Zimbalist. Regarding the kind of music we can expect from the film, Rahman says, \"It's really edgy, the mode of making the movie is from the school of movie-making by Danny Boyle , but it's very Pele â€” very Brazilian. It's got that influence and I loved it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:28:22.053+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
