He is most supportive but doesn't involve himself in those conversations so when asked he was basically saying that.\" \nInitially when asked if he felt responsible for aiding actresses in pay equity, Renner told the business website: \"That’s not my job. I don't know contracts and money and all that sort of stuff.\" \n\"I’m a performer and I know human behavior,\" Renner continued. \"When it comes to that sort of stuff I let other people deal with that. I do what I'm good at, that's what I focus on.\" \nRenner starred alongside J ennifer Lawrence in American Hustle . It was Lawrence's comments in an essay titled \"Why Do I Make Less than My Male Co-Stars?\" in which she said she was paid much less than her American Hustle co-stars -- also including Christian Bale and Bradley Cooper -- that sparked the equal pay debate in Hollywood. \nCooper said on ABC's Good Morning America Tuesday that he'd be open to having transparency in an effort to gain equal pay for his female co-stars. He continued, \"Today, it's so hard to get movies made and you definitely are having conversations with your agent about, 'Take a cut or do this or put money over here.' So why not say, 'OK, well, what's everybody making? Let's make sure it's as equal as we can make it.'\" \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
