Red | Oct. 02, 2015 at 05:50pm \nCould it be that Lola Nidora has another out-of-town challenge for the Pambansang Bae Alden Richards? We didn’t hear she has, but the other half of the phenomenal AlDub love team on Philippine television flew to Cebu yesterday right after Eat Bulaga. \nWith or without a task though, there was no stopping Richards from meeting the Cebuanos on a workday to thank them personally for their overwhelming support for the AlDub split-screen romance the Kapuso actor shares with Maine “Yaya Dub” Mendoza. Alden Richards \nRichards was featured in a Kapuso Fans Day. Cebuanos had a chance to get up close and personal with him. The national sensation sang and danced for his fans’ viewing pleasure. The show started at 6 p.m. at the Gaisano Island Mall Mactan in Lapu-Lapu City. \nAdding more entertainment to the event were exciting contests such as “That’s My Bae” where male participants battled it out with one another in a twerking dance showdown; and “Dubsmash Like Yaya,” where the females channeled their inner Yaya Dub all in the name of fun. \n“With the undeniable nationwide success of Eat Bulaga’s “Kalyeserye,” the Network is happy and proud to bring Alden Richards close to the people who make AlDub a smashing hit – the fans. Without them, this would not have been possible – a fact the Network recognizes and is grateful for. This is for the Cebuanos, the supporters from all over the country, and a first among many,” says Oliver Amoroso, GMA’s Head for Regional Strategy and Business Development Division. Gabby Eigenmann joins Beautiful Strangers \nI missed this guy, after his role in Once Upon a Kiss in which he played a priest. Gabby Eigenmann is one of the best actors on television today and while he play, most of the time, supporting roles, he is able to steal the thunder from the lead actors each time he is in a scened. Gabby Eigenmann \nRecently, he was cast to play an important role in Beautiful Strangers as Atty. Gani, who is Noel’s foster brother. Rocco Nacino plays Noel. \nAtty Gani is responsible and generous, apart from the fact that he is also very intelligent having finished law school as a scholar at a reputable university. He even topped the bar. \nHe joined the public attorney’s office to help those who cannot afford legal help. He knows this because his parents were all products of the country’s public school system. Benjamin and Gabby \nTheir life changed after her father’s rich uncle left his wealth with him. That change in status didn’t alter his outlook in life, remaining humble and down to earth. His friends and relatives egg him to run for Congress. He will meet Kristine (Heart Evangelista) and fall for her. \n“Very excited,” he said when he learned that he’d be joining the cast of Beautiful Strangers.”I’m excited to be working with great actors like Tito Boyet de Leon, Ms. Dina Bonnevie and happy to be working with my friends Ben Alves and Lovi Poe. It’s mu first time to work with Rocco and Heart. Looking forward ako makatrabaho sila. “ \n“Nagpapasalamat ako sa GMA for giving me another opportunity na mapasama sa cast ng Beautiful Strangers. Sana po tanggapin ng mga sumusubaybay ang bagong character ko na si Gani. I already felt the warm welcome sa first taping day ko nung Monday (Sept. 28). “ Gabby Eigenmann with Rocco Nacino \nTheir life changed after her father’s rich uncle left his wealth with him.

Nora Aunor stars in GMA Network’s new primetime series \nMany of you are wondering why superstar Nora Aunor was very visible these past couple of weeks on the Kapuso network. Has she been signed by GMA 7? Or was she simply making guest appearances? Perhaps, the network and her manager are cooking up something for the big screen for her. Nora Aunor is now a certified Kapuso \nWonder no more, Noranians! Your idol will be in a new primetime series on the Kapuso network. It’s going to be called Little Mommy. I don’t have the details of what the show will be all about, but what I only know is she is one of the stars of the show. \nAunor will then be a certified Kapuso. \nAldub fever brings back Filipinos’ TV viewing habit \nWith the Aldub phenomenon bringing people from all walks of life back to their TV viewing habit, families are now spending more time at home. This is especially true on Saturdays when the weekly plot of the Eat Bulaga “KalyeSerye” seems to reach a climactic conclusion every time. \nNot to mention that all Internet connected gadgets that Aldub fans own have become more hard working as evidenced by their record-breaking tweets every time the “Kalye Serye” reaches the peak of its cliff-hanging episodes. \nJust last weekend, the Aldub Nation almost shattered Twitter with the #AldubEBforLOVE hashtag on the first akyat-ligaw or home courtship of “Pambansang Bae” Alden Richards in the mansion where Yaya Dub (played by Maine Mendoza) lives with her adoptive grannies. This garnered over 25 million tweets within just a span of 24 hours. \nThe downside to all of these, if you can call it as such, is the increased usage of electricity. Spending more time at home, the non-stop usage of connected devices, and the related air-conditioning and what have you, only increase the total wattage that Meralco will bill us at the end of the month. \nBut Aldub fans need not fret because Meralco announced an electricity rate reduction for September – the fifth consecutive month that the power utility has done so. According to Meralco’s advisory, overall power rates in September this year went down by 57 centavos per kWh hour. \nSeptember’s lower rates are particularly attributed to improved power supply from power generation companies, Meralco’s third-party suppliers. \nTo further ensure access to affordable and reliable electricity, Meralco is also continuing its rollout of Kuryente Load, the country’s first-ever prepaid electricity service. Over 12,000 customers now enjoy this prepaid electricity service. \nGirl-boy bonding in Taste Buddies \nIt’s a foodie Saturdate with the girls and the guys in Taste Buddies. \nTune in as Kapuso actor Paolo Contis and celebrity Tim Yap hang out with Solenn Heussaff and Iya Villania.

Ariel Inton recently sponsored two free block screenings of Heneral Luna at Robinsons Magnolia’s Cinema 4 on Sept. 24. \nHe said, “I believe in the movie so much, and I just want to make sure that more people, especially the young students, get to watch it. All this talk of heroism makes us think about what we can do as individuals. \n“In my own humble way, I just want to make sure that the gallantry of Antonio Luna continues to burn in the hearts and minds of our youth. I just hope that other concerned citizens can do the same and help ‘carry the flag’ in their own small way.” \nAlso present during the afternoon block screenings were cast members Epy Quizon, Aaron Villaflor, and Leo Martinez.
