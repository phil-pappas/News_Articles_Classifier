A Norwegian animal park won't press charges against the bumbling hunter who gunned down two moose before realizing he was firing through the zoo's fence, an official said Monday.\nThe shooting deaths of the two animals at the Polar Park Arctic Wildlife Center in northern Norway were accidental and an unbelievably rare tragedy, Polar Park CEO Heinz Strathmann told CNN .\n\"We can't explain what happened, but probably the hunter must have been so eager that he didn't think,\" the head of the animal park said.\nThe unidentified man was traveling with a pack of moose hunters Oct. 7 when one of their specially trained dogs broke free after catching scent of one of the huge animals and scurried under a fence, according to Norwegian news site, The Local .\nThe hunter fired off one round, which fatally hit one moose and then lodged in the stomach of the second one, which then had to be put down.\nHe realized moments later that the fence bordered the popular zoo, which is home to bears, wolves, lynx, wolverines, foxes, deer, elk, reindeer and musk. The hunters then alerted the zoo.\n\"I was surprised. I had my mouth open for a while,\" Strathmann said. \"This has never happened before â€” and I don't think it will happen ever again. It is a one of a kind.\"\nPolar Park zoo, located north of Narvik, is now down to three moose, he said.\nOfficials plan to have the hunters pay for the replacement of the two animals, which could cost roughly $7,000, CNN reported.\nPolice Superintendent Katrine Grimnes told the news outlet the hunter is being questioned and could still be punished for the fatal mishap.\n\"But we don't know yet. The hunter is being interviewed as we speak,\" she said.\nStrathmann and Polar Park did not immediately return Daily News requests for comment Tuesday.\nmchan@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories Hunter kills largest African elephant in 30 years Moose runs wild during 9-hour romp outside of Albany SEE IT: Lovestruck moose in Alaska go at it in mating ritual", "external_links": ["http://www.thelocal.no/20151015/hunters-shoot-elk-in-zoo", "http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/19/europe/norway-hunter-shoots-elk-zoo/"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:18:28.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
