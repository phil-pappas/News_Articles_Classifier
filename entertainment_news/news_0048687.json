She just added another feather in her cap--the diva is now a designer too. Kangana’s collection called Marquee, under the brand Vero Moda, will be available in stores from today. \nMaking her first public appearance post the release of Katti Batti, the actress who was the showstopper at the launch of her limited edition collection, reiterated that she still is the best in the industry. \n“Everyone who has been disappointed with Katti Batti’s failure should know that every endeavour of mine might not bear immediate fruits, but are bound to be an integral part of my future successes. My journey thrives on obstacles and setbacks. However I still stand by what I said as we live in a democratic country and I am free to say what I like,” blurted the actress. \nIn an interaction with City Express, Kangana talks about how experimenting – films, characters or fashion – is her middle name. \n\nYou are very choosy about endorsements. What made you endorse and design for Vero Moda? \nFor a long time, friends and family members have known my desire to design my own fashion line and when Vero Moda approached me to design the second edition of Vero Moda Marquee, I jumped at the opportunity. Vero Moda is the choice for the fashion-conscious, independent young woman who wants to dress smart with quality, affordability, and inspiring clothing. Though choosy, I’ve always been experimental in nature and working with this brand allowed me to express my creativity and sense of fashion. \n\nTell us about the collection? \nThere are five broad themes that have inspired this collection: Dandelion Dreams, Deep Lake, Red Velvet, Royal Enchantment and Gold Rush  Dandelion Dreams -A very dreamy collection with botanical design elements.  Deep Lake - This collection is inspired by the colours of a deep lake. Deep metallic tones add a fresh perspective to emerald green.  Red Velvet - Red velvet is a classic theme with a very sexy and a bold feel. All the pieces in this story are dramatic, accentuated with lace and embroidered in rich florals.  Royal Enchantment - Inspired by royalty, this collection has a rich mix of luxe embroideries, in interesting geometric patterns. Colour palette is a mix of rich silver and royal blue.  Gold Rush - Inspired by the ‘Midas touch’, the gold in this story is flowing like liquid, bold and soft. The styles in this collection are absolute show stoppers and are gorgeous. \n\nJust like your films, which are mostly women centric, the brand is also only womenswear. \nYes, and that’s what I love about Vero Moda, as it caters to fashionable women across the globe. During film promotions, fans would come up to me asking how they can adopt my sense of style. More than selfies and autographs, this has been a long standing request that continues to pop with every promotion. The collection fills this gap as it is a true representation of my personal style. \n\nYou are called the style diva of Bollywood. What do you think earned you this title? \nI take it as a huge compliment! I have always been true to my own personality and instinct - in terms of the roles I choose, the people I associate with and my fashion sense. Maybe that’s what seemed to click with fashion experts from the industry and has resulted in me being known as the style diva. \n\nBut initially when you had entered the industry, fashion pundits had given a thumbs down to your fashion sense. Do you think you have evolved as a fashion icon? \nMy sense of style is very personal and cannot be clubbed to fit one’s trend expectations. When I entered this industry, my roles and movie choices were criticised as well, but I kept my focus on my work. My learning from all of this has been to be true to myself on every step of the way. It’s helped so far! \n\nYour favourite outfit from the collection? \nOhhh! It’s difficult to say because I’m in love with the entire collection. The collection has something for every occasion and everyone- no matter your style, we’ve got you covered. \n\nYou have sported a different look in every film – not just with clothes but also with your hair. How do you manage to do this? \nIt all depends on the role and character that I am playing and what the director dictates. Because it all boils down to giving the audience a great experience. I also get immersed in the persona of the character I need to play and to look the part is one big part of this.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:46:41.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
