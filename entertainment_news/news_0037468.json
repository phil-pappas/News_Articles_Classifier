The girl was taken to Comer's Hospital, where she was pronounced dead about an hour later.\nEvans told police she was alerted by her 7-year-old son and found Cherish hanging from a cloth belt that was wrapped around her neck and around a bar in the closet of her bedroom.\n\"I took her down. I didn’t know what to do. I called 911. I took off the belt,\" Evans said.\nPreliminary information from police indicated the death was being investigated as a possible suicide. An autopsy was conducted Thursday, but the medical examiner's office said the cause was pending further police investigation.\nNo one was in custody, but the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services said it has placed two other children with a family member while the investigation continues. The department said it has no prior contact with the family.\nEvans believes her daughter's death was an accident.\n\"My baby didn’t do this on purpose,\" she said. \"She was playing. It was an accident.\n\"They say she tried to kill herself,\" Evans added. \"My baby was very happy.\"\nEvans said she was fixing supper Wednesday night -- pork chops, chicken and rice -- when her 7-year-old went to her daughter's room to get her and found her dead.\n\"I went in the closet and she was hanging in the closet,’’ Evans said. \"I don’t know how she got up there. She had to be trying to get down.\"\nShe said her daughter wasn't moving and could not speak.\nEvans said Cherish loved playing with scarves and belts.\n“If you had a scarf, she’s going to put it on,’’ Evans said.\nCherish would often remove a belt from clothing, such as her robe, and tie it to the baby's stroller and pull it around, Evans said.\nShe had a new Tinker Bell comforter and sheets and played with the pillow cases too, tying them up and moving the pillows around, Evans said.\nEvans said she is a single mom who stays at home to care for her children. The family recently moved back to Chicago from Florida to be closer to relatives.\nCherish, who would have turned 9 on New Year’s Day, loved to read, draw, write and listen to music, she said.\n“My kids are always with me. It’s just so messed up because I keep my kids inside the house because I worry about taking them out and them getting into something,’’ Evans said. \"I can’t do this without her.’’\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562a29c2/turbine/ct-police-investigate-death-of-girl-8-on-the-south-side-20151023"], "published": "2015-10-23T23:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:18:46.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
