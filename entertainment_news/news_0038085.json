After this, we will never speak of the pain again.\nWith this week's defeat at the hands of the New York Mets and their suddenly unstoppable superstar Daniel Murphy — a career .288 hitter whose postseason power numbers have nearly matched his previous season-high of 14 home runs — Six Flags Great America has been forced to change its name.\nTemporarily.\nSix Flags Great America photo Due to the Chicago Cubs defeat to the New York Mets, Six Flags Great America has temporarily changed its name to Six Flags Great Mets. - Original Credit: Handout\nDue to the Chicago Cubs defeat to the New York Mets, Six Flags Great America has temporarily changed its name to Six Flags Great Mets. - Original Credit: Handout\n(Six Flags Great America photo) \"It is with a great angst and disdain that we report that we have made good on our bet with our sister park, Six Flags Great Adventure, where we agreed to rename our park and our ride if the Cubs lost,\" officials from the Gurnee theme park said in a Friday statement. The announcement came nearly two full days after the Cubs actually lost in the National League Championship Series, so good job postponing the reckoning.\n\"Six Flags Great America will be known as Six Flags Great Mets,\" the statement added, \"and the world's tallest, steepest and fastest wooden roller coaster, Goliath, will be known as GoMets for the remainder of Fright Fest.\"\nThis news arrived about a week after Great America emerged victorious in a similar but not as extreme wager with its sister park in St. Louis. When the Cubs defeated the Cardinals in the National League Division Series, it was revealed that the Eureka, Mo., theme park had to temporarily name its American Thunder roller coaster \"Cubs Thunder.\"\nSix Flags St. Louis loses bet, renames coaster 'Cubs Thunder' Dan Moran Most friendly wagers over sporting events between cities involve food and are paid off quietly, but Six Flags St. Louis is paying for the result of the National League Division Series in a very public way — temporarily naming one of its thrill rides after the Chicago Cubs.\nAmerican Thunder, a wooden...\nMost friendly wagers over sporting events between cities involve food and are paid off quietly, but Six Flags St. Louis is paying for the result of the National League Division Series in a very public way — temporarily naming one of its thrill rides after the Chicago Cubs.\nAmerican Thunder, a wooden...\n(Dan Moran) At Great America, where Raging Bull would have been called \"Raging Cardinals\" if the Cubs had lost, employees were also treated to St. Louis delicacies that included toasted ravioli and pork steaks with Maull's Genuine Barbecue Sauce, which apparently is the Charlie Robinson's of St. Louis.\nFor the National League Championship Series, the ante was upped to include more than merely food and the names of rides. In Friday's' statement, park president Hank Salemi seemed to admit that Great America might have overplayed its hand just a but in the heady excitement we all felt when the Cubs won not one but two different postseason elimination rounds.\n\"We were so confident that this was the year for the Chicago Cubs that we amped up our wager with Six Flags Great Adventure,\" Salemi said. \"Unfortunately, we will have to bear these two shameful renames of our park and roller coaster for the remaining weekends of Fright Fest. There's always 2016.\"\nSo this would be the part where Cub fans everywhere are supposed to curl up in a ball and lament our bad fortune, especially at the hands of a storied and arrogant rival. But as stated in this space when the Cubs began this somewhat-magical mystery tour in early October, there will be no more thumb-sucking about curses or 1908 or whiny-whiny-whine-whine.\nI say to you, my fellow Cub fans, that 2015 was only the beginning it was intended to be when The Plan was drawn up. Winning 97 games and then another four in October was a very good start for a group that was concocted to compete in 2016, 2017, 2018 and so on and so forth. Onward and upward, my friends.\nSix Flags Great America photo Due to the Chicago Cubs defeat to the New York Mets, Six Flags Great America has temporarily changed its name to Six Flags Great Mets. - Original Credit: Handout\nDue to the Chicago Cubs defeat to the New York Mets, Six Flags Great America has temporarily changed its name to Six Flags Great Mets. - Original Credit: Handout\n(Six Flags Great America photo) There is also a bright side to losing this bet with Six Flags Great Adventure: Those of us who struggle daily with the fact that everyone under 30 refers to Great America as \"Six Flags\" can take a break for the next week. All you young people can go as crazy as you want from now until the end of Fright Fest and refer to the Gurnee theme park as \"Six Flags\" over and over and over.\nAs of Nov. 2, this \"Six Flags Great Mets\" will go back to being known by its given name — Great America, damn it — and the Cubs Culture can move on to a future so bright, we'll have to wear shades.\ndanmoran@tribpub.com\nTwitter @NewsSunDanMoran\nCopyright © 2015, Lake County News-Sun Chicago Cubs New York Mets Travel Gurnee Six Flags Fright Fest National League Championship Series St. Louis Cardinals", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562a7f26/turbine/ct-lns-moran-cubs-six-flags-st-1024-20151023", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562a8180/turbine/ct-ct-lns-moran-cubs-six-flags-st-jpg-20151023", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562111a8/turbine/ct-lns-six-flags-bet-st-1016-20151015", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562a818e/turbine/ct-ct-lns-moran-cubs-six-flags-s-jpg-20151023"], "published": "2015-10-23T21:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:10:04.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
