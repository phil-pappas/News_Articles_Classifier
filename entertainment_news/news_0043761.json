The presentation is scheduled for Wednesday, Oct. 21, from 10:30 a.m. to noon at the Anderson Inn at Quarry Hill, 30 Community Drive. \nZaring’s recently published book, “Flavors from Home: Refugees in Kentucky Share Their Stories and Comfort Foods,” shows how newcomers in unfamiliar lands often find comfort in cooking and sharing traditional recipes from home. The author’s talk will interweave samplings of refugee’s traditional dishes with their tales of perseverance and personal reinvention. \nZaring is a native and current resident of the Bluegrass State. Her book will be available for purchase and she will be signing copies of the book, as well. \nAdmission to all Adventures in Living Well programs is free of charge, but registration is required by contacting Quarry Hill at 921-6116. Quarry Hill, an extended-care community for adults age 55-plus, is a member of the Pen Bay Healthcare family of services.
