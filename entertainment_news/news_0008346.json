Take a look at how a day on the sets of 'Dilwale' panned out...\n\"It's important that I let you feel films. So, please do not term it as a marketing thing because I really want to show you how a film is made and then comment about how cinema is made in our country.\n\nShah Rukh Khan and Kajol in a still from their upcoming film, 'Dilwale' \nI believe that this whole exercise is just for that,\" Shah Rukh Khan says while ushering me and my journalist friends into the sets of his upcoming film, 'Dilwale', in Hyderabad.\n\nRohit Shetty with Shah Rukh Khan \nWe stepped into a bungalow, which will shown as the star's house in the Rohit Shetty film, to watch raw footage of the shoot so far.\n\n\"The visual effects and DI (digital intermediate) are yet to be done, so don't judge the end product by what you see now,\" he said.\n\nDirector Rohit Shetty explains a scene to Kajol \nAs SRK, dressed in a green tee and blue denims, played out the footage, we got a sneak peek of a romantic song featuring him and Kajol shot in Iceland.\n\nShah Rukh Khan with Varun and Kriti Sanon in a still from the film \nThen we moved to a few scenes set in Bulgaria and a couple of tracks featuring Varun Dhawan and Kriti Sanon. The song and dance was followed by high-octane action sequences a la Rohit Shetty â€” Audis, BMWs, Mercedes and not to forget, a 1969 Mustang being blown up.\n\nRohit Shetty funnyman Johnny Lever and Varun Dhawan on the set \n\nRohit with Shah Rukh Khan and with his cast and crew \nTurning 50 \nShah Rukh Khan, who turns 50 on November 2, will celebrate his birthday in the midst of his fans. Since he will be out of Mumbai to shoot the last song for 'Dilwale', he will take a day off from work to come home to bring in his big day. He has planned a big bash at a suburban hotel in the evening for which he has invited select members from his fan clubs across the globe.\n\"My team is planning something big as it is my 50th birthday. Fortunately or unfortunately, we will be shooting for 'Dilwale' in Goa. But I will make sure to spend one day with my kids. My birthday doesn't belong to me anymore, and it needs to be celebrated with everyone who has given me so much love,\" says SRK.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T05:28:35.446+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
