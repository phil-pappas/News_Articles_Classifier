According to Veronica Croft and her son, Chris, the Enneagram opens doors to self-awareness and understanding of others and is the most effective route to better relationships and a happier life. The authors empower readers to make real, positive change with “The Enneagram: Pathways to Happiness: An Extraordinary Guide to Realigning Your Life & Becoming Your Best Self” (published by Balboa Press). “Most self-help books do not take into account that there are different types of people with different problems and different needs,” Veronica Croft says. “That’s where the Enneagram is unique. We provide the reader with the way forward to a happier life for their own personality type. The Enneagram is about every person in the world, every relationship and every interaction, and makes sense of the ups and downs of life. Everyone wants to feel good about themselves, be free of their less-than-positive aspects and to be happy – with the Enneagram, they can.”\nThe authors have been leading in-depth Enneagram courses for more than 10 years, and say that many people are discontented with their lives. They recognize that people are searching for answers to questions like: “How do I find happiness?”; “Why am I stuck in negative patterns?”; and “Why am I having problems in this relationship?” With this book, the authors assure readers they will come away with answers to all of these questions and more. They feel their book provides unparalleled clarity about why people are the way they are, an understanding of the differences between people and the path toward the best life possible.\nAn excerpt from “The Enneagram: Pathways to Happiness”:\n“Although there are many paths towards growth, only the Enneagram offers real, deep self-understanding. It brings awareness of all the different facets of your personality, both positive and negative, in such a way that self-esteem increases as you accept and work with them. Then, real personal and spiritual growth becomes not only possible but inevitable, and the magnificence of your light can really begin to shine!”\n“ The Enneagram: Pathways to Happiness ”\nBy Veronica Croft and Chris Croft\nHardcover | 6 x 9 in | 464 pages | ISBN 9781504331951\nSoftcover | 6 x 9 in | 464 pages | ISBN 9781504331937\nE-Book | 464 pages | ISBN 9781504331944\nAvailable at Amazon and Barnes & Noble\nAbout the Author\nVeronica Croft is an experienced Enneagram teacher, a public speaker and teacher of emotional therapy techniques.
