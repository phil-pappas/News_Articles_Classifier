Chicago is currently down 0-3 against New York, and will need a win tonight to stay alive for a chance at the World Series. So far it’s been the Mets ’ pitching which has kept the Cubs at bay, with Jacob deGrom the latest to earn a victory over the underdogs. Tonight’s 2015 MLB playoffs live stream and TV coverage will arrive through TBS and other sources.\nAccording to WGNTV.com on Oct. 21, a lineup change has been made for the home team Chicago Cubs tonight. Jorge Soler will move up to the No. 2 slot in the lineup, while Kyle Schwarber will hit sixth in the game. Everyone else will bat in their normal positions. The two starting pitchers will be Steven Matz for the visiting Mets and Jason Hammel for the Cubs. Hammer will need to limit the opponents’ hitting as best he can or this series will be a clean sweep and New York will be in the 2015 World Series.\nIn last night’s Game 3 win by New York, Daniel Murphy continued his hot streak belting out another homerun. This one came in the third inning and was a solo shut against Cubs’ starter Kyle Hendricks. Ions Cespedes also came up big for the visitors, as he had three hits, two RBIs and a run scored. For the pitching staff, deGrom worked seven innings, striking out seven, while giving up the Cubs’ only two runs of the game. Tyler Clipart and Jeurys Familia each pitched one inning to help secure the win.\nMets vs. Cubs NLCS Game 4 will begin at a start time of 8:07 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday night. Live television coverage will be on TBS around the United States. For live streaming online feeds, U.S. cable and satellite viewers can watch on the TBS website, while MLB.TV or Postseason.TV subscribers can also watch live online through their appropriate websites or apps. If Chicago wins, Game 5 is expected to be held on Thursday night at Wrigley Field.", "external_links": ["http://tvplanet247.com/2015/10/16/2015-mlb-playoffs-alcs-nlcs-live-tv-online-preview/", "http://wgntv.com/2015/10/21/cubs-reveal-lineup-for-do-or-die-game-4-vs-mets/"], "published": "2015-10-22T01:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:50:31.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
